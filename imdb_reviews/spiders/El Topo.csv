0,El Topo,10,12 November 1998,"Unique, brutal, fascinating, allegory of many religions..","It's a violent, brutal, to some confusing, but fascinating and ultimately a brilliant allegorical film. It was the first of the midnight cult films.Unrelenting at times.  There are several characters and situations the protagonist experiences. Each of these characters and situations have a connection to various (mostly Eastern) religions.  The feel of the first part is almost like a mid-period Fellini spaghetti western (had Fellini made a spaghetti western--which he did not).  The second half of the film has an entirely different feel, message and pacing.  The second half of the film is an allegory of the New Testament.  Eventually it does all tie together however.There seems to be a scene missing at about the mid-point of the film, and a characters motivation suddenly changes.   Jodorowsky explained it was mostly intentional, but, two shots were ruined and never re-shot which would have helped set up a more discernible meaning to the scene in question.  It occurs between the women in the desert.Jodorowsky will not explain in detail all that he was going for in the film.  He considers the film an Eastern.... he agrees that my interpretation of various characters embodying Eastern religion and philosophy is correct.   He also was creating a film of emotions, violence, salvation, and redemption---so he intentionally did not follow the expected structure of most films regarding first, second and third acts and when major conflicts occur.He flippantly agreed with some New York critics years ago who described the film as one which seemed to be a filmed version of a very strange L.S.D. trip.  He had a lengthy conversation which was published and used as liner notes in the El TOPO soundtrack album which talked about the film in terms of it being something akin to a LSD trip.   But Jodorowsky said, you certainly don't need LSD to enjoy it, it's already been done for you.This was not something he was serious about it.  But being 1969,  and after having trouble getting a distributor for the film in the first place, and now watching the film having moderate success as a midnight cult film and amongst college students he decided it was good for the film to agree that the N.Y. critics were partially correct.It is at times an extremely disturbing film. I thought I detected more than a little of misogyny in the film-- --however, as Jodorowsky essentially told me--none has been intended, except that the world now, like in the past, has always brutalized women and men have insisted on brutalizing themselves.Seeing it with an audience in a theater also means you can discuss it with people of all types.  Reactions to the film are all over the map.  Most agree it is art---- many don't like the film---many find it too disturbing, too violent, too sacrilegious, too scattered. Others disagree over the various messages and meanings they receive from the film. Others just 'enjoy' it as a wild, weird, disturbing film.Usually video copies of the film are from Japanese laserdiscs which fog all pubic hair.  It looks strange if you are not familiar with this.It is a film akin to an Opera.  Although it was extremely low-budget, the film is an epic and has, if not a big budget feel to it,  an impressive grandeur and sweep that few films achieve.Filmed over a course of nearly three years, the filmmakers twice were stranded for weeks without supplies and without money.  This film was started in 1964/65, completed and originally set for release in 1967/68, it predates The Wild Bunch, Easy Rider and other 60's landmarks....     It was a true labor of love to finish the film.  And then the film was banned in several countries.It is not in general release.  For many years from the late 70's to the mid 90's it was rarely if ever shown.A few years ago I revisited the film in a theatre and had the opportunity to discuss it as an audience member and later on one with Jodorowsky.   His other film Sante Sangre is also quite good in my opinion, but I am not a fan of his Holy Mountain. Other films he has been involved with are of lesser value. He was a good friend of Fellini's and may someday direct Fellini's script of Don Quixote.  He is working on Son of El Topo, but not sure when it will be released and who will distribute it.El Topo began a nearly 5 year run as a midnight film and often sold out. It started in a small Greenwich Village theatre in New York City. After a few years of success in NYC, other prints were distributed to college campuses and for midnight shows in other cities.  It became a modest hit!"
1,El Topo,,24 January 2002,Easily one of the strangest movies ever made!,"I have seen three movies by Alejandro Jodorowsky - 'El Topo', 'The Holy Mountain' and 'Santa Sangre' - each are amazing, but 'El Topo' to me is the most successful. I was almost going to say ""most accessible"" but that would be misleading! It's still a difficult movie, steeped in religious and occult symbolism and allegory. I doubt whether anyone but Jodorowsky himself truly ""gets it"", but it is still the most watchable and entertaining of the three, and the best introduction to his work.Jodorowsky not only writes and directs he plays the title role (translates as ""The Mole""), a mysterious black-clad gunfighter who claims to be God. I won't bore with a detailed retelling of the plot, but it initially involves El Topo's quest to find and fight the four masters of the desert, and ends up with him becoming part of strange community of outcasts who live underground. But there's much more to than that, just watch it for yourself.
'El Topo' was a cult favourite thirty years ago, and still stands as one of the most extraordinary movies ever made. Nobody but Jodorowsky has even come close to repeating it. Currently difficult to find, but persevere, it's worth looking for. A truly unique piece of cinema that no-one who watches will ever forget!"
2,El Topo,8,5 November 2006,The Weird Weird West,"So far I had only seen Jodorowsky's ""Santa Sangre"", but that one happens to be my all-time favorite film! One thing's for sure with this director whenever you check out one of his films for the first time: you should expect the unexpected and prepare yourself for not believing what your own eyes are observing most of the time. Just in case you really have to label ""El Topo"" with a genre, it would presumably be Western, but that still doesn't give you any idea of the film's content whatsoever. Within the first ten minutes alone, things occur that are already too weird to mention (like grown men shooting at women's shoes and bandits dancing and caressing monks!!) and these sequences aren't relevant to the actual plot yet! Well, I'd love to summarize the main story lines, but the truth is that I didn't understand one iota of it all. The pivot character El Topo, portrayed by the director himself, rides through the desert with a 7-year-old naked kid in tow. He exchanges the kid for a beautiful woman after defeating a gang of thugs and goes on a quest to visit four ""masters"" of the desert. Subsequently, he joins a community of mountain people and fervently helps them coming out of their dark habitat and into the open world. Yes, it's a very vague description, but that's because I didn't know what was going on anyway. Most likely, you won't either and that's not an insult to your personal intellect! It's just a messed up movie that you mainly just need to watch for its visual brilliance, symbolism and extremely stylish choreography. Every single character that walks through the screen is a demented & complex individual, and the protagonist is the absolute biggest weirdo of them all. He actually claims to be God himself  and really believes it, too  and does the most unpredictable things imaginable. Admittedly, this film isn't suitable for entertainment purposes. It's an intense and demanding experience that you should approach with an open state of mind and loads of patience. Purely elite cinema that can't be compared to anything else ever made."
3,El Topo,,10 May 2004,incredible stuff,"Truly astonishing film from writer/director/composer Alejandro Jodorowsky. This is one of the most hypnotic films you'll ever see and is one that stays in the mind for days afterwards. Think Leone, Fellini and Peckinpah joining forces to make a mystical, existential and spiritual western and you're someway close to Jodorowsky's masterpiece. There are so many things to like and admire in this film from the sometimes purposely jarring editing and the beautiful music to the gorgeous vistas inhabited by a plethora of interesting and unusual characters. Track down a copy (Italy's Raro video currently has a decent dvd on release. I got mine from xploitedcinema) and you will not regret it.  Be warned though - some of the images are pretty extreme, especially for 1971. A stunner and a definite must have for any serious film collector."
4,El Topo,7,17 August 2008,Not for the weak of heart,"""El Topo"" was one of the first midnight-movie cult hits because of its visually stunning, mentally exciting indulgence in gratuitous sex and exaggerated violence Avenging angel El Topomeant to be wise and mysticalrides into a town whose population has just been massacred He guns down some of the cruel and perverse bandits responsible and brutally punishes their leader He leaves his seven-year-old son with some monks and goes away with the gang leader's woman, Mara In the desert sands, El Topo and Mara make love, and she quickly falls in love with him After their frantic love-making, she tells him that he can prove that he's the 'best' by killing the Four Masters For no apparent reason other than to please Mara, El Topo begins his mission, defeating and killing each of the Four Masters The film has been quite controversial It lacks clarity and has painful emotions that make it quite compelling"
5,El Topo,,30 April 2006,El Topo as a spiritual metaphor & journey.,"I saw this movie about a dozen times from the early to mid '70's. It was labeled ""a cult movie."" While I never joined a cult, I was moved to see it a many times as I did because it was a metaphor that spoke strongly to my own spiritual searches at the time. The western motif and travels of our hero/anti hero spoke eloquently of the ""mole's search for the light."" While the violence was overwhelming at times, I didn't think is redundant or too much. Western society, perhaps all great civilizations, was built on a tremendous amount of violence. The scenes in the mountain with those marginalized from society and their subsequent ""liberation"" out of the mountain and into the light was an awesome scene. The violence that took place after wards and our own here's self immolation was very poignant. I continue to look for the movie today and hope that whatever is preventing it from being available in North America will be resolved soon. I am very curious to observe my own responses to this film today. I have seen other movies by Jordorowsky and none equaled the impact that El Topo had upon me."
6,El Topo,10,12 July 2005,A religious allegorical western of redemption with surrealist imagery.,"""El Topo"", is probably Jodorowsky's most talked about film next to ""Santa Sangre"". Like all his films it is bizarre and full of symbolism. El Topo is a cowboy dressed in black. He is out for vengeance, kind of like the Biblical God of the old testament. Him and his son ride through a town of massacred civilians. He wants justice and to win the heart of a girl, Mara. He gives up his only son, in an act that could be looked at like God, or even Abraham. He has to kill seven master gunfighters. After all the violence and carnage, he is injured and taken under the care of cripples, dwarfs and other various misfits. He is reborn, almost like a Bhuddist monk. He becomes like the new testament God, Jesus Christ. El Topo is now like a savior to the oppressed. He vows to dig a tunnel out of the cave so the cripples can live among the villagers. The town is taken over by religious fanatics. Poor villagers are branded with the religious icon by force. An upper class of elitists now dominate the town. ""El Topo"" is beautiful, and chocked full of violent and disturbing imagery. The film became a popular cult sensation in the early 70's. It was embraced by the likes of John Lennon, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson, Peter Gabriel and Pink Floyd. More recently celebrities like Marilyn Manson and the Coen Brothers have talked about being strongly influenced by Jodorowsky's work. ""El Topo"" is important, because it was the first midnight movie. If people could forget about ""the Rocky Horror Picture Show"" just for a second, they'd realize that this is one of the most important cult films. A bizarre and surreal western that can never be imitated. The only 3 surreal westerns I can think of to pre-date ""El Topo"" that have many similarities are Brazilian director Glauber Rocha's ""Black God, White Devil"" (1964) and his follow up ""Antonio Das Mortes"" (1969) and the Italian Spaghetti western ""Django, Kill if you Live, Shoot"" (1967)."
7,El Topo,8,2 April 2002,"Bizarre,surreal and amazingly violent.","This is my first venture into Jodorowsky's territory and I can safely say that I'm highly impressed.""El Topo"" is one of the most bizarre and impressive movies you'll ever see.It features plenty of interesting,weird characters,lots of religious symbolism and extremely violent gun-fight scenes.One of the producers of this one is Mexican horror veteran Juan Lopez Moctezuma(""Alucarda"",""Mary,Mary,Bloody Mary"").I urge you to see this masterpiece right now.Simply breathtaking!"
8,El Topo,10,29 October 1999,An obscure western with a difference,"This was Alexandro Jodorowsky's first recognised cult movie in the early seventies. Shot in Mexico, El Topo (or the mole in English) is a gunslinger (played by Jodorowsky), who, dressed completely in black leather, rides on his horse with his seven-year-old son through the desert; until they come across a massacre of people. One of the survivors tells El Topo who the culprits are, and he then takes on the guise of God and seeks revenge. There is a lot of surrealistic imagery from then on as Jodorowsky explores violence, racism and religious themes, but it is absorbing and the ending is very obscure. An easy candidate for a cult movie."
9,El Topo,1,3 August 2010,Ludicrous and Nonsensical,"I usually love the avant-garde, the offbeat, the strange and the surreal. Being a fan of David Lynch, Takashi Miike and Terry Gilliam, bring me the weird and bizarre  but do not bring me ""El Topo"". This midnite movie cult classic is one of those films I had been told was a ""must see"", though I knew it was not that easy. Most viewers either love or hate the movie with no in between. Jodorowsky delivered as writer/director/actor/composer a mixed bag of metaphor, allegory, imagery, spaghetti western, fantasy, horror and utter gore, weighed down with Buddhism and Christianity, and just about anything else from the philosophical and metaphysical kitchen sink. The aforementioned is fine, but when the final destination for the audience is nowhere, I can understand the passionate hatred from those who despise the film. Of its lovers, many told me it was ""trippy"" and they simply liked it because of that.The narrative, however, is all over the place as El Topo (The Mole) travels the Mexican desert to face and kill The Four Masters of the Desert. Do they represent the Four Horsemen, the Four Winds, the Four Elements? It is anybody's guess. The movie is so loaded with imagery upon imagery it is as if Jodorowsky was purposefully stirring the pot just to keep people guessing. Maybe as lovers of the film try to decipher the layers of meaning, Jodorowsky is laughing somewhere. This film did not satisfy me on any level because the result was a pile of primordial ooze that did not have time to gel into something coherent. Granted, I was intrigued by Topo's Zen-like transformation, especially when he worked so diligently to save the deformed cripples, but this was not enough to justify what came beforehand.The movie is a circus sideshow with bits and pieces that are at times amusing while disgusting on other occasions. In this vein, Jodorowsky delivered the grotesque on a tortilla. At times both ridiculous and frightening, he shocks the audience with a stream of phantasmagorical scenes that lead only to the end credits and nothing more. Whatever Jodorowsky was searching for, it was for him and him alone. The movie was self- indulgent and left me amazingly disappointed.I can sit and discuss Lynch's disturbing ""Eraserhead"", Miike's over-the-top ""Visitor Q"" and Gilliam's Orwellian ""Brasil"", but Jodorowsky's work leads to a dead end because it is utterly nonsensical."
10,El Topo,1,20 July 2002,A major disappointment...,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I was perusing the Foreign section of the local video store of rare and hard to find films when I saw ""El Topo"" sitting plainly on the shelf.  My heart rose, as I had heard much about the film and wanted to see it very much -- plus it is so hard to find and JESUS CHRIST it was sitting right there!I took it home and watched it right away.  I was extremely disappointed. Folks, there is a reason why this movie is so hard to find, let me tell you...(SPOILERS)The first half of this movie has the main character El Topo with his young son riding through the desert where they encounter various violent wierdnesses.  The first is a barn in the middle of nowhere with mutilated human and cattle all over the place.  Only one man is left - he is lying on the ground, wounded, and begging for El Topo to put him out of his misery. El Topo gives his gun to the seven-year-old boy, who kills the man.  Nice, right?  This is just one of the many pointless situations they get themselves into.  After this, they arrive somewhere else, and then somewhere else, again and again, just for more unexplained violence, without any other plot, explanation, or transition between these episodes.The second half begins after El Topo is shot dead.  We are taken to yet another remote village in the desert (again, without any explanation or reason whatsoever).  A few scenes stand out in my head:1.) A man is slaving over a group of women in some sort of salon.  They all seem to be hitting on him, wanting him to fool around with them. Eventually, one of the women drops something, and when he bends over to pick it up for her, she pulls him to her inner thigh and then starts screaming out that he is advancing on her without her consent.  The other women rush over and start hitting him, then sexually abusing HIM, all the while shouting at him to stop raping them.  He is dragged outside by the town's men where he is hung and shot.2.) In some sort of room, a bunch of townspeople are passing around a gun loaded with one blank bullit (which they pretend is real) and pretend to play Russian roulette.  Everyone misses the blank bullit, and shouting out that they are holy for being so lucky.  The son of El Topo (who has found his way to this village and now grown into a man) takes the gun, removes the blank and replaces it with a real bullit.  He then does a round of roulette on himself and survives.  The people love it.  They pass around the gun, pulling the trigger on themselves, surviving.  Each time, they shout out praises to God and what not.  In all the excitement, a young child grabs the gun and shoots himself in the head and dies.If these scenes are supposed to mean something, I sure as hell missed the point.(END OF SPOILERS)It's not that I don't like Jodorowsky's work, or am weak-stomached.  I adore SANTA SANGRE and would recommend it to anyone.  It's just that the film seems to exploit unpleasantness as if it were a valuable asset in a film. It does so without entertainment, shock-value, or any other form of success and just comes off as a waste of the little time and money it might have cost to make it.  It is offensive for that reason - offensively bad.Anyone who is on this website must appreciate good films.  I know I do. There is so much else to apply your mind to, ladies and gentlemen.  Go out and rent something worth your while.  Don't rent this crap just because it's rare and ""notorious"".  That's why I rented it, but that's not why I didn't like it.  Even for those who pursue hard-to-find videos, like me: beware. This is pretty lousy film-making."
11,El Topo,1,26 June 2006,Overrated  - Symbolic Does Not Equal Great Film,"I was initially excited about seeing El Topo. Not only had it received excellent critical reviews, but I also found various postings on the Internet praising the film as a masterpiece. Well, I'm here to say that this is a vastly overrated student art film.The symbolism is overdone and sophomoric at best. In fact, it is as if the director thought symbolism could be substituted for plot and character development, forgetting that these are tools used to enhance them. Also, the overly hackneyed and simplistic symbolism takes away from the surreal experience that the director intended to create. It was akin to viewing the subconscious of a mental midget: weird but boring as all hell!! I'm not even going to dwindle on the violence. It goes without saying that over time it has lost its shock value. However, it was not necessarily gratuitous--although the symbolism was--and did add to the story.Overall, if you like freaky stuff for the sake of freakishness, this film is up your alley. But, if you want more substance and meaningful development avoid El Topo at all possible cost. I know I want those two hours of my life back!"
12,El Topo,5,2 September 2013,Style over substance,"Yeah, I didn't think much of this surrealist western, even though I was prepared to like it and WANTED to like it was I watched. By the end I couldn't help but feel it's another case of ""the emperor's new clothes"" in terms of style over substance, and the sum of the whole ending up much less than the individual parts.The story starts out straightforward enough, with a distinctive gunslinger discovering the aftermath of a massacre and vowing to take revenge on the outlaws responsible. Once that story is out of the way, though, it starts getting weirder and weirder, almost existentialist, as the gunslinger has encounters with a series of deity-like characters in the desert and undergoes a religiously significant transformation. By the end, I was quite frankly bored.Here's the good stuff: Jodorowsky's cinematography, which is glorious. EL TOPO is vibrant-looking and colourful throughout, and I love the use of surreal imagery which really works. There are poignant scenes and flashes of Peckinpah-style ultra-violence and the contrasting elements are mixed together well. It's just the script, really, which lets it down, becoming too abstract; I always prefer a more concrete narrative as a basis on which to pin the more fantastic elements, but EL TOPO is lacking such a construct and at times just seems to be being made up as it goes along."
13,El Topo,1,14 August 2013,Worst thing I have ever seen,"According to certain sources,this film was some how an inspiration of sorts for famous people such as Marilyn Manson and John Lennon, to name a few. With that being said, I watched this film in hopes of being inspired, and boy was I wrong. This was the absolute worst piece of garbage that I've ever seen. Not one single second of this entire movie made sense. The fact that I sat through the entire thing without shoving pencils in my ears and clawing my own eyeballs out, is nothing short of amazing. The director of this movie clearly did not put forth much effort into making a movie that is deemed fit for human viewing for a person with a fully functional brainWould watch again"
14,El Topo,2,21 August 2013,Fake: a make believe art film.,"Saw this when it came out many years ago, and was appalled to find that so many of my friends considered this mess to be a 'good' movie. It is, in fact, a pastiche of art film clichés with a load of whipped cream, jimmies and a cherry-on-top existentialism for idiots. I commented at the time on how the visuals were perceived within the framework of drug culture stating that while stoned on pot and well under the influence, 'El Topo' becomes a violent, would-be erotic freak show, and that, I suppose can be very heavy for some viewers. For others, it is enough to make one yawn. So, take your drugs, let your jaw drop, and try to enjoy this watered down knock off of many better films. It certainly didn't work for me.Yes, it has some unusual imagery, designed to fascinate the clueless and titillate the TV hypnotized hordes, but in total, it is no more meaningful than an 'in depth' article in USA Today. A poor sensationalist film by a minor director whose subsequent career foundered badly."
15,El Topo,1,22 April 2008,Holy Crap,"To say that Jodorowsky uses symbolism in this film is an understatement. There is no plot; it's all symbolism, a Biblical allegory exploring themes that only Jodorowsky and his fans can appreciate. The script, if it could be called that, is amateurish and pointless, featuring random acts of violence, which veers from silly to repellent. The self-indulgent Jodorowsky may be called a poor man's Sergio Leone, but doing so would be an insult to the Italian master. The acting is uniformly terrible, including Jodorowsky himself in the title role, a la The Man With No Name. Films like this give surrealism a bad name."
16,El Topo,9,16 August 2008,Of Gods and Guns,"In this breathtaking mystical and spiritual western, Jodorowsky retells allegories of several religions to present his audience with an examination of the consequences of action based on every variety of human emotion. Lust, love, rape, compassion, murder, euthanasia, sacrifice, liberation, enslavement, faith, death, and procreation - few stones are left unturned in this desert.A highly skilled gunfighter who calls himself God travels through the desert with his son and visits the scene of massacre. Seeking righteous vengeance, he tracks down the perpetrators, and, having exacted revenge, abandons his son with a group of Franciscans and adopts the agenda of a woman he has freed from bondage because of his desire for her. This very generally covers the first quarter of the film, and the themes that are implied are re-examined several times throughout the film.El Topo (the mole, played by Joudorowsky) seeks the light, but as we learn in the opening sequence, the light will instantly blind him. His desires and the actions they inspire progress from primitive detached self-indulgence to redemptive self-sacrifice. He does wonderful things, and loathsome things, and the consequences of his actions are never as he intended. Thematically, the story hints at the connection between Taoist concepts of acting through inaction and mystical aspects of some western religions - simultaneously suggesting that only God can know the mind of God and that if no god exists, humans must acknowledge their dependence on the forces that govern the universe and seek harmony by yielding to them.Like most westerns, there is a great deal of killing and gun play in El Topo, and the death scenes are often grueling and over-dramatized. Unlike most westerns, however, none of this violence is pointless, and it is not the central action of the story.Jodorowski is a deeply spiritual film-maker, but is also intensely critical of organized religion and the demystification of religious ideas. He seemingly has little faith in the human ability to conceptualize cosmic forces. Notably, Jodorowsky never makes any statement whatsoever about science.The meta-narrative of El Topo can be read in many ways, and is the level at which the film achieves high art. Does the transparent allegory of El Topo's life suggest that the Judaeo-Christian god is, himself, blinded by the light and consumed by fires he himself starts? Does the more or less consistent inaction of His son indicate a way out of the catch-22 of causes and effects his actions have set in motion, or does his son's determination to take on the responsibilities and relationships of his father convert the son into a new embodiment of the mole? Or is it human ignorance, willfulness and wickedness which are responsible for all of miseries of human existence? Each thoughtful viewer will take away a different message.Gender is a major theme in El Topo, and although the main story is clearly presented from an androcentric perspective, Jodorowski adds a lot of details which effectively deconstruct this, and, in some cases, unmask it as an arbitrary convention of patriarchal religious doctrine. When you watch the film, pay particular attention to the voices and bodies of the different characters. I am convinced that these details are not simply added to jar and disorient. Finally, a comparison of the two main female characters - the loves of El Topo's life - is very important in 'getting' this film. One represents true love and true beauty, and the other illustrates something else. And it is significant that it is El Topo and El Topo alone, in his quest for the true path, who brings to his relationships a spiritual aspect. Considered without his self-proclaimed god-hood, there does not appear to be anything supernatural about these women or his relationship with them. Perhaps there is also a comment on agnosticism somewhere in all of this.Well acted (especially Jodorowski), beautifully shot, and excellently scripted, El Topo is a great film by a great, though eccentric, film maker.As a non-religious Taoist and scientist, I found it easy to contextualize Jodorowski's story and the messages it appears to carry. I do not, however, pretend that my interpretation is correct. To do so would be an act of violence against the film's art.If you're up for a brutal film which can not be enjoyed without a great of concentrated thought, I recommend it."
17,El Topo,4,13 September 1999,Needs specific conditions to be seen,"The following annecdote is true:One teenage afternoon my friend Victor told me we must go see El Topo, the greatest film of all times. He had seen it the day before and was stunned. I was fond of Alexandro's ""Fabulas Panicas"" in the sunday newspaper (a cow wanting to become a cube, and the sort), so I went on with enthusiasm.The film is stuffed with stuff, and lets anyone be his own interpreting ""genius"" of the goulash he's presented with. It tries to impress wellthinkers, and succeeds. It's full of sound and fury (and dozen of ounces of red paint), but signifies nothing. A few striking images rest in the mind, a few phrases, already read in the ""Fabulas"". And the sensation of being utterly cheated.As we left the theatre, Victor confessed:""It sucks, man, but I didn't realize it yesterday. I was on acid"".That's one specific condition in which you can enjoy (and maybe think you grasp) El Topo. Other one, if you remained ""forever"" (that is, stoned for life). The third and last, if you ego as an intellectual is too big to admit you were fooled like a baby by an artist of fakery."
18,El Topo,,3 December 1999,Great artifact of cult cinema,"'El Topo' is Jodorowsky's Masterpiece !! Incredible movie making, some people just write this movie off.  I think that is a totally closed mind of approach to this fascinating film.Even if you hate it,you have to admit the power of the film, great imagery.Alejandro did a great job,this movie is a real labor of love,it deserves rediscovery.One of the greatest films of the seventies,unforgettable is the only way to sum it up."
19,El Topo,2,11 July 2016,"Sparse, minimalist religious symbolism","As someone not too interested in religious symbolism, I did not enjoy this film. It's sparse and minimalist and very little happens in 2 hours. There's not much offered to the viewer other than a very brief story that appears to be some kind of metaphor pertaining to religion. The meaning isn't obvious either, so you're just watching some weird, meaningless stuff unless you put thought into it and try to come up with your own explanation. It's not particularly visually beautiful or engaging in other ways.I can see how this could be an interesting film for people who are interested in Christianity and enjoy these kinds of exercises, although I suspect this is a film that receives a lot of spurious praise from people who like it just because it's so out there or because they think that's the cool thing to do. It's trendy in certain circles."
20,El Topo,1,4 November 2010,el topo is a no no,"i refuse to appreciate a film just because it is different n surreal or due to the wider opinion of the movie bourgeois that only they can enjoy it and thus are elite or of a more intelligent constitution and those who cant are vermin. there are many movies in this genre n of course the attributes on which a movie is merited are debatable but the foremost dharma of a movie is enjoyment of the viewer. i feel this does not achieve that. it comes across as a misguided eastern fixation and its erroneous interpretation, not unknown in the western civilization unfortunately, together with the horrible amalgamation of it with a western, ritualistic scenes and unnecessary violence which has culminated in this work."
21,El Topo,7,23 July 1999,Recipe for El Topo,"Considering viewing El Topo?  Imagine this: combine 2 parts Sergio Leone, 1 part Last Temptation of Christ, 1 part Easy Rider, 1 part Three Amigos, 1 part Houston's The Bible, a dash of Kubrick-esque, 1,000 dead rabbits, a lot of red paint, a huge ego, and some bad acid.  Bake very well.  This movie is epic in its scope as well as its silliness, and times profound and at times idiotic, so disgusting it hurts and one of the movies you do not watch with your parents.  You will love it if you love movies, and laugh about it all the way back to the rental store.  P.S. Jack Valenti would have a field day with this one."
22,El Topo,7,25 November 1999,A Buñuelian spaghetti western,"This film may be rarely shown elsewhere, but it has never been hard to see in Toronto. It's been screened on a semi-regular basis at the Bloor Cinema for the past 20 years or so. But last night was the first exposure for me.Luis Buñuel had a significant career in Mexico through the '50's up to the mid-'60's. Perhaps there is some direct connection to director Alejandro Jodorowsky, perhaps not. But this film has a very strong flavour of Buñuel, his religious themes, his absurdity. I think the profoundest parallels may lie in ""L'âge d'or"" (1930), but there seem to be allusions to ""Un chien andalou"" (1929) and maybe echoes of ""La voie lactée"" (1969) too. Perhaps others even.How is a sheep on a tower like a cow elevated on a bed? They're both incongruous and ridiculous. One is Jodorowsky, one is Buñuel. Or a crucified sheep on a wall vs. a dead donkey on a piano. A swarm of bees, a handful of ants. Incongruous would also be the victrola which appears a couple of times, or the butterfly net. They both remind me anyway of the tennis racquet -- that mocking symbol of French civilization in decline -- from ""Un chien andalou"".Jodorowsky's character of the Colonel bears quite a resemblance once he's fully dressed to the officer in the Germaine Dulac / Antonin Artaud film ""La coquille et le clergyman"" from 1927. Jodorowsky even has the Colonel sit in a confessional at one point, for goodness' sake.So that's why I think this film in its early stages at least is a conscious homage to the great French surrealist films. Certainly that piggyback amputee composite character is one that Buñuel must have wished he (or Dalí) had thought of. Go for your gun!The rest extrapolates from and carries on that absurdist style, incorporating the sexuality, the shocks from that artistic movement, and adding the enhanced violence of the 1960's.What does ""El topo"" mean? With its fertility symbols, its old whores. Goats represent the souls of the wicked, according to a verse in St. Matthew. Could that be relevant? Maybe.Well, what did any of those influential films of the 1920's ""mean""? At that time, they were on assault on conventionality, established norms, bourgeois values.Precise meaning may not be the point.But I can certainly tell you what got the biggest laugh from the audiencelast night -- the cactus pear scene. Even bigger than the iguanas, if you can believe it. Hi-ho, Silver!"
23,El Topo,3,25 August 2007,The first movie that I felt ashamed of myself for watching...,"Watching this film because of John Lennon's endorsement and a short synopsis I had read, I found myself very upset about what I saw and disappointed with the story as a whole (particularly the second half = the acting and plot went downhill very quickly). While the visuals, for the most part, are amazing and hauntingly desolate/strange...the film quickly became an unsettling, pretentious mess. First, the entire film is a biblical allusion (Old and New Testament), which would be great...BUT Jodorowsky's religious references are so blatant and redundant that they become annoying, tired and expected (like moral ground in a Disney cartoon geared toward a six year old). Secondly, there are hundreds of dead mutilated, mostly real animals throughout the entire film making it one to watch on an empty stomach (I actually do biomedical research using rats, which I have to dissect biweekly for brain and spinal tissue, and the animal carnage still gave me a foul taste in my mouth). Thirdly, the physics don't make any sense at all (a certain thrown knife that impossibly kills a baddie...as well as other incidences that make you say ""what...but how???"". Finally, what makes me most ashamed for watching this film, is the gratuitous, undignified and disrespectfully dark humor use of actual maimed and deformed (by birth defects) people throughout the entire film. A perfect example of this is a part where a man with no arms reaches for a gun in his holster.So before you buy...I strongly recommended renting it. And if you really want a slick, surrealist gunfight film, try Branded To Kill by Seijun Suzuki (so strangely wonderful, he was fired for making it)."
24,El Topo,1,5 June 2008,Harm and pain inflicting worst movie I have ever seen,"From the very first moment that the movie starts until the finish line it causes great pain in your brain, the soundtrack is awful and reaches high repetitive pitches that can put you in the worst loop of dizzy drowsiness ever, the dialogs are ridiculous, the characters deliver terrible confusion plus the plot makes 0 sense. Consider the grotesque moments of humor accompanied by disgusting circus music in the background. The director tried to make a work of art, and amazingly there are people that think that this has some kind of artistic value, you can't fall in a deeper pit than Alejandro Jodorowsky. The only use of this piece is as great torture tool when friends come over."
25,El Topo,1,4 February 2013,Rubbish quest for enlightenment ...,"very boring movie... not a message, not technique, nothing interesting to see. Just trying to appear a high class movie..... The film was selected as the Mexican entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 44th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee..... Its official DVD release was in 2007. It copies some stuff from David Lynch, Korosawa, and the whole others but nothing new. Well, a lot of films don't have any interesting message, and you watch, just to be entertained, This movie even doesn't have that. The reason I didn't like this movie is that it tries to appear like a high class movie, which is not. It looks like a c**t in a temple, just inappropriate."
26,El Topo,10,13 November 2008,An Epic Fantasy of Peace and Magic,"I don't normally rate a movie a ten, but this movie deserves it.The concept of taking Zen parables, presenting them in spaghetti-western form and adding enough Christian imagery to make a dozen ""Omen"" movies is so far out that one cannot imagine it getting past the first producer's meeting in this day and age. If this director wasn't an inspiration to Oliver Stone, then, there are two dangerously insane people running around and directing movies.Cripples and amputees adorn this movie like baubles on a Christmas tree...REAL amputees...REAL dead and dying animals for that matter. It gives the movie a decadent, dream-like feel. Essentially a three-part film, the first two parts reek of death; whereas, the third part reeks of insanity.The dwarven love-interest introduced in the third part of the movie is beautiful, perhaps because, although she plays her role because she is a dwarf, she plays it like an actress.Not for kiddies, but adults, check it out!"
27,El Topo,10,23 January 2008,Changed me,"This movie and his other title Holy mountain. changed me. Alejandro is one of the most influential directors ever. He is horribly over looked. This movie is my favorite western. Not surprisingly I am the only one of my friends who knows of him. I have been spreading the word though. A lot of the film is metaphor's. It kind of reminds me of ninja scroll, the way he takes special ""demons"" 1 by 1. Alejandros son and wife are in the film also. I saw him in a recent interview. He said a lot of things were real or improvised. *chuckles* He had sex with a lot of his female cast mates, and did drugs with everyone. With the lack of originality, by striking writers. Now is Alejandros time."
28,El Topo,9,9 July 2007,"A truly great epic, in the tradition of Dante or Taliesin. Timeless film making.","The tag-line for this film does it no credit at all, but that is because the person who wrote it obviously did so for a Hollywood audience - ""See the priest ride into the sunset with a midget and her newborn baby"" or is that a wild west freak show audience? The film and its narrative is rooted in an ancient storytelling tradition that is earthy, real and appeals to an innate human sense of symbolism and drama. Watching such a tale unfold can give you a real sense of relief that despite the often over sophisticated diet of todays media, we can still follow a tale in a way that calls on a different part of the brain, the same part that has handed down wisdom between cultures and generations over millennia. It is visual storytelling that almost needs no dialogue. While watching it I was continually struck by the similarities with Sergei Parajanov's films 'Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors'1964, 'Sayat Nova (Colour of Pomegranates)' made two years before this film and 'The Legend of the Suram Fortress'1984 - if you like these films you will also like this one and vice versa - If anything this film is a bit more conventional, in a north American cultural sense than Paradjanov's deeply mysterious Georgian cultural symbolism, and a good deal more visceral (theatrical blood excepted). I would suggest that to class this film as a western, may satisfy the genre purists in as much as that its costumes and locations conform, but seriously misses the underlying moral, almost biblical tale - complete with sheep, goats rabbits and owls, but no cows or cowboys. This is more of a mystery play out of the central Russian steppe. Having said that, it is impossible to miss the mildly Zapatista political critique of what presumably represents 'gringo' culture; some of which are very insightful indeed, particularly the 'colonel's' men begging for the glimpse of a woman's breasts, and even more delightful, the use of the 'eye in the pyramid' logo to represent the Yankee dollar and those who have sold themselves to it. Take two hours out, watch this film and just let it soak in, better than any feel-good experience that Tinseltown has to offer."
29,El Topo,,25 June 2007,Prepare to Experience one of the most Wonderful Experiences of Your Life.,"**** out of ****This film, EL TOPO is a flawless, exciting, and emotionally draining experience. Absolutely amazing. it is such a privilege to finally view this fantastic film. This is the kind of film that really makes you smile at some of the wonderful things about film and the power of film and what it can represent. I am so happy that more people have the opportunity to finally watch it.I cannot describe the plot as any description of it, no matter how vague or subtle, will not keep it from sounding ridiculous or silly. This film is a lot of things. It is not quite a western nor is it quite an action film. It isn't quite a romance, nor is it straight out drama. It isn't quite a musical nor is it quite a horror film. It isn't quite a biography, nor is it quite a prison or crime film. It isn't quite pornography, but it isn't quite a splatter film. It is not quite a religious film as it contains all religions. it has some many details from all of these genres littered throughout. It is hard to put a label on this film because it is so outside the realm of being labeled as anything. I feel that this film belongs in a specific group that only consists of this film, the follow up entitled THE HOLY MOUNTAIN, and the one before it entitled FANDO Y LIS.I feel that this film represents more than just a simple form of art or a simple form of expressionism. This film represents a kind of specific audience point of view of people who want to be pleased by a type of film that is weird in a comfortable way. The film has so many satisfying details, from the set design to the way, the story (spanning more than 10 or 20 years), the natural way events play out, the extreme violence and gore, the fine madness of the characters surrounding the main one, and the human interactions and how the characters differences in their bodies or the way they think don't get in the way.The film is very humorous too. There are several parts that i did find very darkly funny. I don't want to ruin anything, but there is a very predictable part involving a gun and the people not taking the weapon seriously enough to allow any person to try it out on themselves. It's quite dark and pretty sinister, but i laughed at it's extremity because you just don't get that kind of effect from the usual film.When i say the film is flawless, i don't mean technically, i mean flawless in representing the filmmaker, Alexandre Jodrowsky's intentions of the film and it's representation of himself or his life. Since the film is meant to partly be autobiographical, it allows him to use himself in all of his personal designs and representations of how he thinks and what he wants to present on the screen. I feel since he used his own son as a key character (his character is a priest in the second half of the film) and used his voice to dub in a large portion of the characters to place them in easier context to himself, he is able to further demonstrate his own vision even further. This is a man who didn't have a happy childhood with his father trying to force him not to have children to not carry on the family name and eventually being gay, it's an interesting choice to have the main character kill off a manifestation of his father early in the film.Many people that i know probably know who director Alexandre Jodrowsky is, especially if they are Marilyn Manson fans since that dude practically worships him. But if you are interested in midnight films or cult film, this film practically invented them, so I highly recommend this wonderful and brilliant film.Contains extreme violence and gore and strong sexual content"
30,El Topo,10,2 December 2006,Sergio Leone on acid,"If you're into Zen gunfighters, lesbian cowgirls, enslaved dwarfs and pistol-packing Jesus freaks, this is the movie for you. ""El Topo"" may well be the greatest movie ever made; it's certainly one of the strangest. It's no wonder it became a counterculture classic, or that John Lennon considered it his favorite movie. So much has been written about ""El Topo,"" its symbolism, its meaning, its violence, that the movie itself has gotten lost in the confusion. To put it simply ""El Topo"" is a western, and a darn good one. Sure, it's not exactly John Ford, but anyone who can enjoy and appreciate the films of Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah, or Clint Eastwood should be able to enjoy it. For 75% of the movie we have a fairly traditional ""spaghetti western"" with an added serving of nudity and violence; renaissance man Alexandro Jodorowsky, who not only wrote, directed, and stars in this film but also designed the sets and costumes and composed the fabulous score, is obviously indebted to Sergio Leone's masterpieces, but he adds to the mix a surrealist sensibility quite at home with Mexican culture (remember Bunuel?) and an eclectic spirituality that embraces the Bible and Zen with equal enthusiasm. Only in the last thirty minutes does it become really disturbing, but even then the violence is tame by today's standards. Jodorowsky, who bears an eerie resemblance to Bruce Willis, was the ""man in black,"" a gunfighter-avenger who bears more than a passing resemblance to Clint Eastwood's ""Man With No Name""; the later part of the movie, when he becomes a Buddhist monk on a mission of vengeance, must have been the inspiration for the popular TV series ""Kung Fu."" The color photography was beautiful, the gunfights exciting, the characters unique. The DVD I watched was in English with Japanese subtitles, which added to the film's mystique."
31,El Topo,7,5 November 2006,Not the Feel Good Movie of the year...,"El Topo (1970) Rough, hard and dirty, this might describe many things, but it perfectly describes ""El Topo"". Shot in the deserts of Mexico, ""El Topo"" is a hard film containing graphic violence, sex and weirdness that is still shocking to this day. The film opens with a naked boy burring his favorite toy and a picture of his mother and is told today he becomes a man, an almost prelude to the adult material to follow. Shortly after the opening scene a single dead horse is shown, the audience feels a little sad, but the shot after shows an entire town butchered and fresh blood everywhere. The audience knows this is not going to be a feel good movie.""El Topo"" is a movie that fits into several different genres at the same time, it looks and begins like a western, but quickly changes to a quest to rid the 4 gun masters in the desert is eerie similar to a kung fu movie, then the film takes another turn and turns into a drama and a bit lighter after The Mole falls in love with the midget woman. There are acts of comedy that reflect back to the early silent era.Film genres isn't the only way ""El Topo"" reflects pop culture, the film also makes several references to religious symbols and stories and events from around the world. The most eye catching is the reference to Thích Qu&#7843;ng &#272;&#7913;c, a Buddhist monk who burnt himself alive in an interestion in Vietnam in 1963, who also burnt up without saying anything or moving a muscle.The masters in the desert all have symbols and they down grade throughout the journey, the first master had a tower and a huge oasis, the second master had a wagon and a river, the third master had a little cover and a water hole, the fourth had a pole, a blanket and a sheet. The weapons also downgraded as well, the first had two guns, the second had one that could shoot several bullets, the third had one gun that could only fire one gun before reloading, the fourth only had a butterfly net. The masters of the desert were all tricked into being killed, the first one fell and was shot, he used to live high in a tower, the second master was tricked when the Mole sprinkled glass on the ground and hurt the second master's mother. The third was tricked by using body armor ashtray. The fourth master killed himself and stopped the Mole from winning the battle. One other interesting piece of symbolism of the masters is the second and third master, the second master is wearing sheep and owns a lion and the third master has a rabbit farm. The rabbit, the lamb and the lion all play huge roles in Christianity.The Mole is a strong symbol, he wears black and wherever he goes, death follows. When the Mole fights the third master all but three rabbits are dead because of the presence of the Mole. When the Mole is betrayed by his two women companions, for not paying enough attention to them, the women kill him. After being in a coma for years the Mole goes through a transformation change and shaves all of his hair and appears to look like a new born baby and takes on another task, to help the deformed people escape their hole. Unlike the his previous quest, his quest to free the deformed people is not for revenge but thanks for taking care of him. After working with one of the midget women, the Mole falls in love with her and soon she becomes pragent. After awhile the Mole, the dwarf woman and the Mole's first son finally finish the tunnel and release the other deformed people. When the deformed people are killed, the Mole reverts back to his original ways and kills the entire town.With blood and violence, love and sexuality littered everywhere with a huge amount of historical and religious references, ""El Topo"" feels extremely rough, but at the same time can not be looked away from."
32,El Topo,10,11 April 2006,Great,"This is one of the best and most interesting films I have seen in the past year! (along with Eraserhead and Naked Lunch). The film is about a gunmen who rides through the desert with his son. He goes around shooting lots of bad guys and abandons his son. He then falls in love with a woman and he fights down 3 great warriors of the land to achieve his enlightenment through violence. One leader is a blind man who is served by a man with no legs on top of a man with no arms (weird stuff, folks). He eventually gets shot and left for dead by his lesbian wife, where he wakes up enlightened and worshiped in a lotus pose. A bunch of freaks in a mountain take care of him. He eventually digs a tunnel so all the freaks can escape. However, the mean and violent townspeople kill the freaks and El Topo sets himself aflame after he kills the townspeople. His wife and son walk away.Its a great movie and i find there is so much to learn about and lots of symbolism every time i see it."
33,El Topo,10,7 October 2008,Ingeniously Bizarre - A Unique Cinematic Experience,"It is indisputable that Alejandro Jodorowsky's name stands for unique cinema. This man's incomparably bizarre and yet incomparably compelling films are absolute highlights in artistic underground cinema, and no true lover of film could possibly consider not seeing them. Out of Jodorowsky's films, it is ""El Topo"" of 1970 which is most treasured by cult-cinema lovers, and for good reasons. This must be one of the most bizarre and unique masterpieces ever made, and there is simply no other film like it. While ""El Topo"" looks like a (highly unusual) Western at first, it can not be attributed simply to this genre, as the film goes way beyond the borders of traditional film genres. ""El Topo"" may not be everybody's taste, but for those interested in bizarre and unique cult-cinema, this is one of the ultimate cinematic experiences. Jodorowsky's surreal world is simply astonishing in all aspects, be it the bizarre storyline, the eccentric characters, the brilliant visual style or the symbolism. The film's beginning is already bizarre and unique, and it gradually gets more surreal.El Topo (played by director Jodorowsky himself), a grim-looking, full-bearded gunfighter dressed all in black leather rides through the desert with his seven-year-old naked son (played by the directors son, Brontis Jodorowsky). In a ritual boy buries his only toy and a picture of his mother, and the two the ride on to a nearby town at which gruesome massacres are taking place... I would love to write more about this brilliant film's plot, but I don't want to give anything away, as I would hate to spoil any of the bizarre, and unforeseeable events that this film brings in its hypnotic 125 minutes, or even any of those in the first ten. This much, however, can be said: The world of Aleandro Jodorowsky's cinema is complex, surreal and fascinating beyond comparison, particularly in El Topo. Eccentric Characters like they can not be found in any other film, such as four 'masters of the desert', demented bandits or sadistic townspeople, appear in an unreal and demented world of weirdness, violence, symbolism and insanity. Jodorowsky's weird symbolism comes along with an incomparably surreal atmosphere, and it is not easy, no, not possible to determine what it all means - and it does not need to be - 'What the hell is going on?' is a question that one might ask oneself multiple times while watching ""El Topo"" - but in a manner that could not be more fascinating. The film is extremely violent in some parts, and surreal and insanely brilliant in all aspects. Other films by Jodorowsky, especially ""Santa Sangre"" (1989), also come with my highest recommendations, by the way. It is doubtable that a proper description of ""El Topo"" is even possible - This film really has to be seen to be believed! This bizarre masterpiece is one of the most unique cinematic experiences one can have, and an absolute must-see for everybody interested in cinema!"
34,El Topo,10,25 November 2003,A peyote fueled western set in a nightmarish wasteland.,"El Topo (1970) has to be one of the most strangest films in history. A mysterious gunfighter dressed in black accompanied by his young son cross the desert on a holy mission of vengence and redemption. It's a pretty twisted film that's highly enjoyable. Sadly, it's unavailable on video in the United States (legitimately) and it looks like it'll never get a proper release in this country. A film filled with all kinds of beautiful people and unique individuals and it comes across like a bad LSD trip. Too many crazy visuals for a sane person to handle. Many of the film's scenes will be burned into you brain long after you seen it. I highly recommend this movie, It's one you'll never forgot. A true experince in film-making.A+"
35,El Topo,9,1 March 2000,Weirding you out,"There aren't many movies that totally weird you out in almost every scene, but El Topo' is definitely one of them. It is best to give up during the first scene and to let your eyes be the guide for the next two hours. It's biblical, it's mythological. It's likely that everything means something, but I am not the right person to consult here. It's a test for an open mind, a test to see at exactly which point your brain explodes. This is Jodorowsky's movie as he did so much in it. Only he could guide you, but he doesn't want to. So all you have to do is put the tape in your VCR, sit or lie down and absorb the next two hours. This is a tale of the condition humaine'. This is us, in the middle of the desert. This is El Topo'. Don't expect any sense. If you read this till you got to this last sentence, El Topo' might be something for you."
36,El Topo,5,21 September 2007,Existential epic...?,"Comic book writer Alejandro Jodorowsky's EL TOPO (""The Mole,"" not to be confused with Johnston McCulley's EL ZORRO- ""The Fox"") plays out very much like what it essentially is: a cinematic comic book. Topo's ""spiritual journey"" calls to mind many of the martial arts movies of the early 1970's (wherein the hero is usually wronged- and severely beaten and/or his master killed- before he apprentices at the feet of another great master and returns, at film's end, to vanquish his mortal enemy). Jodorowsky himself is good as EL TOPO, but, like many a low budget filmmaker before (and after) him, he often resorts to tasteless exploitation when superior storytelling would've sufficed. It would be interesting to see what an older and wiser Jodorowsky would come up with vis a vis a remake."
37,El Topo,9,30 December 2006,etched deep in my mind,"I watched this film when it came out in 1970 in a wonderful art-house cinema in London, and then in 2006 found a DVD to give it its first re-watch in 36 years - and was astonished that I had forgotten only about a third of the film - almost every scene had been etched that deeply on my mind. Truly phenomenal. I have watched most of the other Jodorowski movies and was more or less equally impressed - but this was the first and so my favourite. Question: when will someone finally translate his novel, ""Where the Birds Sing Most Sweet"" into English. I read it in German, absolutely compelling!

Question: when will someone finally translate his novel, ""Where the Birds Sing Most Sweet"" into English. I read it in German, absolutely compelling!"
38,El Topo,,9 July 1999,Best film on Eastern philosophies and Initiation,"This film is the best example of the way of popularizing Eastern philosophies. In fact, there are several quotations and references to Taoism, Zen, Vedanta, Sufism, and others. Western alchemy is best represented as well. The script leads a man from darkness to light. A mole is the best metaphor for this journey. The atmosphere seems to be romantic, in the tradition of Novalis' ""Henry of Ofterdingen"". Dreams and odd realities are mixed, while the characters move in a Western country. ""If you meet Buddha, kill him"" - this is El Topo's slogan. Very shocking is the scene where his child must bury the only souvenir of his mother. Freud is an underground presence all over the film, as well as Jung, and Lacan, among others. Nonsense logic is dominant, and it seals a strange world where laws are overthrown. Russian roulette is played in the church with awful consequences for an innocent child. At last, after that El Topo has been able to take a people of freaks off their caves, they are violently killed by the people of a lawless city. Initiation consists in killing ourselves: here is the final message of director. Music and atmosphere are aptly run, transforming ""El Topo"" into a very particular Western film. ""Per un pugno di dollari"" and other Italian spaghetti-western films are very far, but there is a similar habitat all the same, maybe for the strong Fellinian influence. The scene with the four killers is the best, in that they represent the four obstacles for the evolution of man. El Topo has been able to win them, but not always legally. Ethics is very twisted: a kind of Umwerthung aller Werthe is very recommended. A film for everybody and none."
39,El Topo,10,8 February 2000,One of the five strangest films is also strikingly beautiful,"Jodorowsky is a master of the grotesque (original meaning of the term). El Topo, his most famous work, is easily watchable due to its striking cinematography and beautiful, if stark, locations.  It may take a couple of viewings to totally grasp the allegories and the odd visual tropes employed by Jodorowsky, but it's worth it.  Please note: on video there are at least two versions available, one of which is about twenty minutes longer.  Make sure you get the original, longer work."
40,El Topo,1,29 August 1999,"Awful, just awful","One of the worst motion pictures I've ever seen.  Unbelievably bad acting. Devoid of plot (at least I couldn't find one).  Very amateurish photography and directing.  Two thumbs down. A movie you'll not soon forget, even though you try!"
41,El Topo,1,27 October 2009,I am amazed at all the positive reviews this film has received.,"Well, that's two hours of my life I'll never get back. Because I have seen and reviewed so many films, I felt like sooner or later I had to get to EL TOPO. It's one of those legendary films that cinephiles have talked about for years, so I reluctantly rented it. Sadly, I could have watched a Pauly Shore or Jonas Brothers movie instead--that's how much I hated EL TOPO.Where do I begin? With most movies I dislike, I try to look at what, specifically, I didn't like as well as try to find some positives. However, with EL TOPO, I hated everything about the film and the only positives are that it wasn't one minute longer and the film's creator has been unable to do a sequel due to difficulty with financing (ain't that a big surprise). Although the midnight movie crowd has adored this film, it is simply nihilistic and nasty. It's full of blasphemous imagery, nudity, buckets of blood, killing of the handicapped for kicks, countless animals brutally slaughtered for the film and the unrelentingly depressing and nonsensical nature of the film--and these elements (plus many more) put together make this a terrible and rather evil film. I am sure that Jodorowsky wanted to offend and provoke the audience, but with so much provocation coming non-stop, it all just got very, very boring after a short time. Imagine if now, in the more permissive 21st century, if the followup film were made. What could Jodorowsky do to top EL TOPO---personally come to the theater and kill patrons or have sex with animals?! I mean, how can you top EL TOPO for depravity?! I think had this film been made in a different time, it would have totally bombed. But, in 1970, the New Age guru-inspired plot elements, the widespread use of hallucinogens and a desire for something different converged to make this film work for a small fringe element. Otherwise, I can't see any normal person bothering with such a self-indulgent ""film"".Avoid this like the plague unless you think seeing rotting, eviscerated animals is art! I mean, think about it--donkeys and horses were killed and gutted (with the entrails hanging out) and dozens of bunnies and assorted other creatures were also killed for our entertainment! And, while you are at it, there were simulated rapes, killing of the handicapped and the sodomizing priests!!! Isn't there sometimes SOMETHING that the film community might consider wrong?! Nah,...I guess not."
42,El Topo,8,26 June 2006,"hey, why not?","I think that was what I said to myself while I watched a bootleg of this underground cult-classic by the un-prolific but undeniably original surrealist Alejandro Jodorowsky. Because, frankly, even with all of the supposed symbolism injected into the film (some that sticks, some that really doesn't), shouldn't really detract from what makes the film work- or not for some. Basically, if you're going into this movie expecting another quasi-genre bending genre western via Sergio Leone, look elsewhere. El Topo is like one uncompromising fever dream that Leone might have had if he had taken a nice bite of peyote. Jodorowsky as writer, director, producer, has this attitude of 'why not' in his unique form of gonzo cinema, where it's more about taking in individual scenes, images, sights, like a manic freak-show with lots of harsh violence (for its time at least). And it did work for me, at least as long as I didn't take it TOO seriously.To describe the 'story' of the film might be close to moot, but I'll just give a two-sentence sum-up. Jodorowsky plays El Topo, a lone, odd gunman who stops a group of wildly deranged bandits (a sign of things to come, making Leone's bandits look like playground kids), lets his naked son off with a group of monks, and sets off to defeat the four best gunmen in the world. After waking up years later after being shot by his former female co-patriots, he tries to help a group of invalid incestuous types make their way to the zealous, un-hinged town above, where his son is full-grown and the sanest in town. OK, if that may give an idea as to what the film is about, keep in mind that this was made in 1969/1970, at a time when a director like Jodorowsky was not only accepted but needed by movie fans who were looking for films that shook the culture. In that sense El Topo is close to being as important as Easy Rider. But to say it's as exceptional is really about as subjective as you can get.Going into the film, all I really had to go on what to expect came from a documentary on midnight movies (where El Topo found its first audience as the first of its kind), and the clips shown and Jodorowsky's own words on it had me excited to see it- though not with the highest of expectations. Watching the film, and after reading several reviews, it's hard still for me to take the film 100% seriously, at least of it being a highly symbolic, poetic work of an art film. If anything, my perception of the film is that it is so ridiculous at times, so strange, and even so deliberate, that a director like Jodorowsky had to recognize the ridiculousness at times. That he also has a definite affinity for the outcasts and 'freaks' of life adds to the enjoyment, that he makes no bones about identifying with these those who are unusual (which make up the bulk of the picture). But it's success for its cult audience has to be due as much to its wild, hilarious appeal as for its art-film, if not more so. In a way, it's too much fun to be a dull, pretentious work- the filmmaker seems to be too talented to really force feed all of this to some amorphous blob of an audience.So, is it a little dated, sure; does it have an entire midsection where certain scenes involving El Topo and his female tag-alongs that jump ahead and misses any conventional logic, of course; does it skate along the edge of being almost a very bad movie, absolutely. But as a fan of westerns, and surrealism, the two do merge well enough for the film El Topo, especially for the fact that it accomplishes what each do- it gives action and daring-do like the westerns, and it provides a level of humor and no-holds-barred outrageousness that marks the tops of surrealist works. If the look on your face at the end is that of a slight jaw-drop and raised eye-brow, however, it's a feeling that's shared by others I'm sure, at least by me."
43,El Topo,,24 December 2003,Weirdest western made marred by bad soundtrack.,"Haunting visuals punctuate an arthouse western marred by inadequate soundtrack, ""El Topo"" (""The Mole"") seems shot without sound in Mexico (with dialogue and sound effects Foleyed in).   On release in 1970, critics called it the most violent film made, though by today's standards seems tame; its violence might still shock but only in context -- but then, critics always get worried when bare-breasted women are juxtaposed against a backdrop of violence, however fakey-looking.   For example, in its first act the protagonist Topo (played by director Jodorowsky) castrates a murderous and tyrannical bandit leader (off-frame) who's sent whimpering naked to the edge of a corral with a pistol:   Tyrant holds gun to head.  Cut.  Splash actor with ketchup.  Action.  Tyrant grimaces and falls.   What's interesting is the stunning visuals Jodorowsky produces:   El Topo rides into frame on a white desert dressed all in black (black horse, black umbrella, black hat, a savage black beard) with sidekick ""Hijo"" (Brontis Jodorowsky), a small profoundly naked boy wearing only a hat, as if to announce the film's recurring theme, the duality of man; knowing v. innocent.  Indeed, two women appear early on (pure v. savage, helpless v. domineering) in which the lesbian context is not left to imagination, especially after they dispatch el Topo in a gunfight culminating in an allegory of crucifixion, after which the protagonist is reborn in a Brahma-like state, assigned to free outcasts from a cave (by digging a tunnel: hence ""the mole"" metaphor), only to release the outcasts into an ""American"" western town whose citizens worship only money (note the ubiquitous triangle containing a single eye) with yet more devastating consequences.   Even after a few drinks, the religious odyssey from Christian to Hindu to Buddhist symbolism will be lost on no one.   The film even seems to come full-circle as the end presages the beginning.   Released the same year as ""Fellini Satyricon"", the Fellini-esque ""El Topo"" was hailed as a masterpiece by a small group of undoubtedly stoned New Yorkers (ah yes, the 70s, mea culpa), and can only be appreciated by a handful of hard-core film buffs willing to endure a video copy of a video copy of a badly overexposed print with bad sound; but still the film is interesting as a cultural artifact, the progenitor of western genre influencing the superior ""Dead Man"" (1996, dir. Jim Jarmusch, w/ Johnny Depp).  Writing from a town where ideas are more scarce than parking places (i.e., LA) ""El Topo"" is crying for a remake, and nevertheless illustrates that, had Jodorowsky had a few dollars more, his film might have actually been a genuine masterpiece.   Alas, but, for those willing to endure a bad copy, ""El Topo"" will remain little more than a visually interesting spaghetti western."
44,El Topo,,2 January 2001,Pretentious and Boring,"This abortion of a movie tried so hard to be such great things, and failed totally.  It ends up coming off as stupid and inane... barely watchable. By far the best part of the movie is the trailer, and that is only amusing for the outrageous claims it makes. (i.e. ""El Topo is Funny.  It is not a Comedy.  El Topo is Religious, but it is not about religion.  It is spiritual."")  The overall impression is that they really thought they were hot, when making this movie, and weren't afraid to share it.  All in all, a great movie for those who want to show how 'cultured' or 'with it' they are, but who have, of course, already had to reject most GOOD movies because they were popular..."
45,El Topo,10,27 May 2000,Fantastic.,"The mole, is the best, best, best, best, movie, movie, movie, I and all the partners at germen´s cine club have seen on the screen. This is a movie about all the religions, and all the judas fears about suicidal tendencies on kids, an violations of little people. The guns shot are very realistic for the time (very realistic)and the script is amazing. The best western that the history of cinema brings to us. You have to see this movie after you  shoot yourself. You have to see this movie. No more comments."
46,El Topo,1,15 July 2007,a crow/raven snuff film,"Prior to my viewing El Topo I had given Jodorowsky's other movie Holy Mountain a ten. I've changed my rating for that other movie to a two, and I rate this a movie a 1 (awful), and both actions are taken for the following reason: In El Topo Jodorowsky kills two crows or ravens. You see them die on screen. Seeing them die right there on screen was incredibly disgusting, disturbing, and outrageous.If the deaths were simulated that would have been OK. But crows and ravens are (along with parrots) the most intelligent types of birds. Their intelligence is comparable to that of great apes and five year old human children.So seeing them killed changed my view of Jodorowsky instantly. I now see him as nothing more than a shallow self serving hack.I've seen The Holy Mountain before on DVD, but yesterday evening I saw it on the big screen at The Tower in Salt Lake. Then El Topo was shown afterward. I'm sorry I saw El Topo, and I'm sorry that I previously considered Jodorowsky to have any level of credibility as a director. Those killings ruined my whole evening.I can put up with a lot and I'm not into censorship. But generally snuff films of any sort remain taboo, even in the art film community - and for good reason. El Topo was a snuff film where two lovely intelligent birds were murdered by the hack Jodorowsky. In The Holy Mountain crap is turned into gold. But El Topo shows that there's some crap which remains crap no matter what you do with it.Avoid Jodorowsky. Do not honor his work by viewing it. A person who kills intelligent animals may have their good traits, but they are in my view morally bankrupt and deserving of shunning by those more enlightened.Lastly El Topo is a jumbled uncomfortable mixed up mess.Anyway I can take Salo. I can take Caligula. I enjoyed Destricted. And I can even handle simulated snuff films where humans or intelligent animals are killed (albeit in a simulated way which isn't readily apparent) as part of a film. But no one would accept having a person killed as part of a non-documentary movie which was released. And no one should accept having highly intelligent animals like a beautiful crow or raven killed either.Maybe in the 70s such actions were more common. Maybe in the rough and tumble world of Mexico morals differ. But abuse is abuse. And any man who kills such birds should be severely fined and locked up for a time. That's my view, after spending the last 12 years of my life living in very close contact with four parrots, and as the operator of an online mailing list with hundreds of crow lovers on it worldwide.When you interact with these fellow animals first hand you recognize their value. So to see such creatures clearly & purposefully killed in a film, well, it made me conclude that Jodorowsky is not any sort of a visionary director. Instead he's merely a shallow & vain hack."
47,El Topo,10,13 May 2007,Too much perfection. But no mistakes.,"Alejandro's second best film. (After Holy Mountain.) Yes, it's a western. A weird one for sure. But that's the good thing.The western style imagery along with underground style film-making gives this a few notches above most seventies cinema. You wondered what the hell was going on, but never looked away.A gunfighter and his naked child take on the best gunfighters there are. Why? To be the BEST! There's Jodorowsky's usual use of cripples and amputees in support roles. And his obsession with showing whole groups face firing squads.The outlaws terrorizing the villagers was the scene to show who was the hero. But where WAS this village? It seemed as if everyone lived in caves. The outlaws dancing with the local priests was funny too. And maybe a little gross.But a great film for reasons that are hard to describe. So see it just because."
48,El Topo,10,26 February 2007,genius,"jodorowsky's movies are, in many ways, similar to one another. people will complain that his movies are inappropriate, grotesque, rebellious, nonsensical, bizarre. that's all mostly true, except that these movies are very socially and politically aware. while some will say they have no plot, the fact is that he says more in his movies than most directors will say in a hundred movies. it's the very people that jodorowsky is lashing out at that don't understand nor appreciate his films. anyway, this is supposed to be a commentary on el topo, but the same commentary can be made for most of his movies. the point is this: if you're easily offended or disgusted, don't watch his movies. save yourself the time and save everyone else's ears for your lack of understanding. they're great movies, but like anything, not everyone will agree or understand."
49,El Topo,,14 December 2006,remains of the topper,"i quite like this film, which is called 'El Topo' which i believe translates in English to 'Al Topper', the name of the main man in the movie whose adventures we follow. i was incensed when i watched 'remains of the day' how they had ripped off this film, most notably Anthony Hopkins character James Stevens, who is obviously a pale imitation of Al Topper. and Emma Thompson's character was a poor replacement for the naked little boy. both films are set in england, but 'Al Topper' is the more respectful to our heritage. James fox as lord Darlington is a subtle tribute/rip-off (you decide) to the armless man in 'Al Topper'. it all depends on your own point of view. i do not like 'remains of the day' - it is a plagiarising of ideas, but 'Al Topper' is a cruel examination of British folklore."
50,El Topo,10,29 May 2005,been 30 years looking for anything on this movie and man,"i saw this movie for the first time in New York City in the early 70's, went twice, then saw it again later in the 70's in San Francisco, i have never forgotten one scene! this was the most amazing thing i had seen to date. 30 years later i have trouble getting people to believe me when i talk about it, at least now, with your web site, i can prove to people this is for real. I would dearly love to own a copy, i understand they can be bought, if anyone knows how to get one i would be most interested. the religious overtones to this flick in the 70's was almost disturbing to some of us who saw it, looking back, i can see why. but today, i would venture that this movie could make a big comeback. it just needs to be put out there again."
51,El Topo,10,2 April 2005,Gunfighting AND Mysticism!,"EL TOPO (5 outta 5 stars) Beware... even though I give it a 5 star rating, this is one of those ""weird movies"" that I tend to like more than any rational person would. Definitely one of the strangest ""westerns"" you will ever see! El Topo (The Mole) is a black-clad gunfighter played by director Alejandro Jodorowsky. He travels the desert with his young, naked son. He comes across a town overrun by nasty, leering bandits. He mutilates the leader, driving him to suicide. Then things start to get really strange. He leaves his son behind, he takes a mysterious woman along on his journey and rapes her, he must meet and kill four strange ""masters"" in order to gain some sort of knowledge or power, he has visions, he falls into a coma for several years, he wakes up as a bald monk and begins doing a comedy act in nearby towns for donations. His violent ways seem to be all in the past but then, just when he seems at peace, the past comes back to haunt him once more. I don't claim to understand it all... heck, I don't think anyone does... I don't think even Jodorowsky understands it all... but it sure is compelling!"
52,El Topo,10,11 November 2004,Amazing and touching despite incredible low budget!,"i got this movie from a friend who told me that it was a psychedelic western in the vein of Pasolini's masterpieces... well my friend couldn't be more right!... this movie has the amatheurish spirit of Pasolini's ""teorema"" (specially on production matter) mixed with the Sergio Leone western's feeling... but never on such a serious way...the history is really weird to understand and the movie shouldn't be that long (2 hours of such underground movie can make you sleepy)... but after seeing it i realized it has lots of beautiful moments... it's like ""teorema"": difficult to get the whole history through the movie, but in the end you can get the whole the metaphors and the ideology behind the low budget stuff.the quest for killing the 4 gun maestros reminds me of the Hercules'legend(!) and the impressive deformed people (I guess with neuromuscular diseases and bone defects that i, as a medicine student, never saw live neither on the books!) are other interesting aspect...the movie is roughly made and quite ridiculous on the production matter but equals Italian masters like Argento on the beauty of contents..."
53,El Topo,5,8 May 2004,I suppose so.,"Jodorowsky's El Topo is an extreme and surreal vision of what Mr. Leone did with the traditonal western.The violence and it's execution is botyh intriguing and disgusting at the same time and there is plenty of the director's unique visual iconography. The trouble is that often this startling imagery doesn't really refer to anything in reality.But I suppose thats no bad thing - after all, why should film have to mean something all of the time?Even so, Jodorowsky knew that narrative is what the viewer yearns for and all of the shock and awe value in the world can't really distract from this aspect of the film slowly down far too quickly.  It really drags on a bit.A prototype for the superior 'The Holy Mountain', but still worth a considred look."
54,El Topo,,10 January 2003,Good introduction to Jodorowsky,"I have been waiting for a long time to see ""El Topo"".  When you realize how hard it can be to get it, it can sound somehow mysterious...however, the film itself is even more mysterious.  Yes, there are several Bunuel influences in this film.  Bunuel is one of the biggest names in the surreal movement, and he's also known for a very audacious scene in his film entitled ""Un chien andalou""...yes, I'm talking about the first gore scene, involving an eye being sliced with a razor blade.  Now, how is Bunuel influencial on Jodorowsky's work?  I would say for the gore, because ""El Topo"", for its time, must have been considered as a very violent and bloody film, and also for the surreal part.  But here I'll have to bring a nuance...many people say it is a surreal film, which I am more than a hundred percent sure would have been denied by the creators of the surreal movement.  Yes, the images in ""El Topo"" are really bizarre, amazing, beautifully strange, but that does not mean surreal.  The film has a message, and it is too obvious to be considered as part of a surreal ensemble.  Okay, it says more on the author himself than it says about the main character, but the continuity and the fact that there is actually a ""storyline"" you can follow are not compatible with the movement it is too often associated to.  The film is full of symbols, and, consequently, I do believe that Jodorowsky is more of a symbolist that likes to add surreal images to his films.Anyways, that said, I can say that ""El Topo"" is truly an unforgettable experience.  It starts with a very beautiful shot of El Topo and his son walking in the desert.  That particular first image tells you right in the beginning that you are not about to watch a very ordinary film.  You watch this ""mole"" (that's what ""Topo"" means in english) visiting a village where everyone has been massacred, you watch him confront several ""masters"" of the desert, including one he covers with dead rabbits and a blind one that is an incredible fast shooter.  You also see a woman, with a despotic husband (who seems to be some kind of ancient army guy) being freed by El Topo, and her husband being stripped, being humiliated, being forced to shoot himself. Again, these are all symbols.  All the images are there to represent something, they have meanings.  So, with all thses crazily bizarre images, what is El Topo about?  It is clear that this film is about religion.  It is a vision of several gods confronting each other.  El Topo encounters two women in his path, and (Spoilers warning) they betray him in the end...and then he's born again, in a village, a place where he is not accepted...does it remind you of something?  Yes, the Bible...""El Topo"" is the Bible, with surreal ideas and images.  It's an allegory of many religions, and if you know enough about them (which does not necessarily mean you're a believer), you'll understand ""El Topo"", and you'll recognize the symbols.  It is really worth the time to study a little bit many religions before seeing this film. It is an interesting parallel explanation of christianity that I think most believers (in their absolutely unopened minds) will not like.  Those who like putting more nuance in things will like it, though.
I'm sorry to have explained all that, and I remind you that it is my own (but also a pretty common) interpretation of it.  But now, also in a more common way, let's talk about the other aspects of the film.  The acting is very good, even though the copy I have is in english with Japanese subtitles (yes it is a bootleg version, I didn't know that before I got it...I bought it from Ebay...so beware if you want to get your own copy) and the film's original language was spanish.  Alejandro Jodorowsky plays the main character, and he has talent as an actor as much as he has talent as a director.  Also, the first woman he encounters (I think it's Mara) is also a great actress, even thought it was her only appearance in a film.
The directing is pretty great, even though not as good as what was done in ""The Holy Mountain"".  Jodorowsky has taken his time to make this film, like any other of his films.  He knows how to make an image impressive and fascinating.  His directing gives a slow paced mood, and plunges the viewer in the universe of his reincarnated Bible using very lenghty shots and very quiet sound effects that are broken by the characters (like the noise of foot steps in a deserted town), again, this directing technique speaks by itself and is, somehow, a symbol, again.  That is not the only interesting technique he uses, but I'll let you discover the others by yourself.
Finally, I would say that ""El Topo"" is a very strange and beautiful film full of symbols and surreal images that will truly please to intellectuals and people who are tired of the average blockbuster.  It could also teach a very good lesson to some main stream imbecils that try to make ""surreal"" films these days (hello Gregg Araki...) or enjoy these ""wannabe films"" (...hello fans of Gregg Araki!).  Some christians are open-minded and others are not, and this film s only for the open-minded ones.  Also, if you're not a believer (like me) but still know a little about some religions, you should definitely go for it.  this film is very hard to rate, really, because there is no doubt it is good, but it really is not usual. Anyways, here's the rating I give it, it's now yours to decide if it is accurate...9/10Note: By the way, ""El Topo"" and ""The Holy Mountain"" are the only two Jodorowsky films I've seen, but ""Santa Sangre"" is number one on my must-see list, I just can't wait to see it and even though I haven't seen it, I also recommend it!"
55,El Topo,9,15 September 2000,Description is not enough...,"El Topo is Alexandro Jodorowsky's second film (the first being Fando y Lis), and his first to rise to success as a counterculture film in the 1970s, which was then followed by The Holy Mountain.I don't know that anyone other than Jodorowsky could've made El Topo. Though the film has its critics (and the total of ratings here is low for a film that does what El Topo does), it's one you ought to see.  There are things in the movie that Jodorowsky undoubtedly meant to disturb the viewer, and the high level of violence is counterbalanced by the imagery. (Jodorowsky, as a filmmaker, is a master at crafting bizarre ideas and symbolism into filmed images.)The plot is...um...weird.  I won't tell you the plot, because it's honestly a good deal better in the execution than in the planning--this is why I think nobody but Jodorowsky can film the movies he's done.On a side note, it seems most copies of El Topo are taken from Japanese laserdiscs, meaning several things:  one, there is a loss in quality, as the minimal transfer is master film; film reel used for LDs; master cassette; tape you get.  So it's probably 3rd gen, has the standard of Japanese film where any ""naughty"" bits are given a digital blur, and two, it has subtitles in Japanese.  I could read some of them (studying Japanese will do that for you), and the sub job isn't exactly great, but it does the trick.  (I believe copies of The Holy Mountain are the same, but I have yet to pick one up for myself.)In any case, El Topo's a film for people who enjoy bizarre, violent films, and probably just as good an introduction to Jodorowsky as you can find."
56,El Topo,7,19 May 1999,pretentious.  bizarre. outstanding!,"a man travels in the sweltering mexican desert fully dressed in hot black leather, while his young son/sidekick travels wearing only a hat?  a western with balloons, pink high heel shoes, and banana-clip loaded machine guns? a tale of the old west with a zen buddhism sub-plot?  does it make any sense? yes. this is truly one of the most bizarre film you will ever see (if you can find it).  but there is a method to the madness.  underneath the strange images lies a story of one man's search for nirvana.  a gunslinger searches for the other gun masters of the desert so he can kill them and be considered the one and only gunmaster, but he ultimately turns to a life of self-denial. it's also interesting to note that this film began filming in 1965, before nudity, graphic violence, and ""head-trip"" movies became common, so jodorowsky can truly be called an innovator. ""El Topo"" is also one of the most pretentious films ever made, but watch it (at least twice) if you get the chance."
57,El Topo,9,4 November 2017,Majestic true cult movie,"I wasn't immediately convinced with this film, El Topo. The initial scenarios seemed too strange in an ugly sort of way... to put it simply. However it gradually became clear that this was the intended style of the beginning of the film and I decided to see the film for what it is, instead of what it wasn't. Then it continued to change. I was engaged by the Western element of the film. Jodorowsky himself played quite a stylish lead actor, and while the film was weird, it began to get weirder... in a good way. It had a unique taste. This wasn't your average Spaghetti Western wannabe. This was a truly unique film. Some of the images and montages that transpired were awe-inspiring and it started to become clearer that this was a real art work and not just an ordinary film. As the film went on it reached a metaphysical level, really mythical too. As with films like Embrace of the Serpent from South America, you feel that Jodorowsky is both critical of the bizarre Christian symbolism he mixes with the native peoples of those parts. He creates a unique fusion that I must admit, I don't know very much of how this all fits into the history and culture in Chile or South America... nevertheless I found El Topo to be quite a fascinating piece!"
58,El Topo,9,10 October 2016,Fantastically Bizarre,"If said too much about this movie, you will miss out on the surprise that you will get out of it. El Topo's bizarreness takes you through the desert of surreal madness, meeting new, creepy, and funny characters throughout. While watching this movie, I realized that Alejandro Jodorowsky changes up his style of the movie a bit, making it completely different in each scene. This is probably one of he most unique movies I have ever seen. And if you love to watch a movie in a more artful approach then this is one of those artistic masterpieces for you to highly consider watching. You won't regret this film at all, due to how satisfying it is to the eye."
59,El Topo,9,18 July 2014,"The Midnight Movie Is Born, And One Hell Of An Acid Western.","It's 4am in the morning. Thunder and rain is pouring hard and stopping me from sleeping, so I decided to flip up the laptop and finally write a review I've been meaning to write since viewing the movie a week ago.""El Topo"" (The Mole), Alejandro Jodorowsky's visually striking western is the kind of movie I've been waiting for in a while. Even after 44 years, this movie still has the power to shock and or charm the viewer through imagery and symbolism that is essential Jodorowsky. So much so that one should catch up with the dream landscape paintings of Salvador Dali, and crack open various tales of religion and folklore because ""El Topo"" has plenty. Even now it's ambiguous what could be represented without forcing an answer.Kind of split into two parts, which has been linked to the Old and New Testament. It begins with a black clad figure roaming the desert on his horse accompanied by his young (naked) son, who doesn't seem to be fazed by the brutal slaughters they encounter on their travels. After the father has claimed his victory from the perpetrator, the imprisoned lady convinces El Topo to abandon his son and set out to defeat the four great gun masters in the West, becoming the greatest gunman of the land. Each master is of different ethnicity & religion, who begin to make El Topo question his motives thoroughly. What I can only imagine is the Adam & Eve story, a female stranger comes to their oasis and joins them in their quest, leading all involved to more mirages and ecstasy of the flesh. Reaching the end of his mission, events unfold which arguably set up the redemption & rebirth of the character.Years later. Our protagonist awakens in a cave full of deformed people, who have nurtured him and worship him as a deity of sorts. Upon leaving the mountain and accompanied by a dwarf woman, he learns the town nearby is populated by a bunch of surreal, aristocratic cultists who trapped the people in the mountain, whom are lacking the physical capabilities to escape. El Topo (Adopting a Buddhist appearance, after a spiritual rebirth) and his friend begin planning to help their people by performing in the streets in exchange for petty cash, in turn to purchase dynamite. During their time families form and re-unite, beliefs are toppled and the motivations for peace are a violent, double edged sword.One could say it's indulgent for a man to direct, write, star and craft the music for his picture. However, on repeated viewings of the directors extraordinary filmography, anything else would feel unjust. ""El Topo"" does right by not forcing it's symbolism upon you, and it's imagery continues to hold up incredibly well throughout its two-hour running length.Final Verdict: Something raw prevails in ""El Topo"", that sets it apart from anything I've ever watched. Arguably it's going to be one of those films I'll highly recommend to my friends, continue to prove foreign cinema is a powerful force of imagination outside of the western world, and is right now finding a spot on my all time top 20 favourite films. 9/10. An experience vital to any film-maker."
60,El Topo,2,9 November 2011,An absurd theater of absurd,"This movie (!?) reminded me of Monty Python, although it is not as nearly funny and clever. Apparently, in those days any number of shoots collected and somehow put together has been regarded as ""movie"". And got ""cult"" status instantly. This approach still has faithful followers nowadays (see - or don't - The Orphan Killer, paranormal Acticity, Blair Witch and such). And the less sense it makes, it is considered more ""artistic"". Like, acting is a shame, editing is something not worth bothering, and directing means (probably) explaining to the participants what they should do (or otherwise, if they do not feel like it) over a large amount of alcohol. Don't get me wrong: this movie (!?) has its moments and is a material worth remaking (by Terry Gilliam, for instance) but this... Jesus! Surreal? Introspective? Thoughtful? My ass! Plain stupid. Forget about it. It's that simple."
61,El Topo,5,12 February 2007,Masterpiece? I don't know. Bizarre? YES!,"For years I had been wanting to watch this hard-to-find movie. I finally watched it and I am glad I watched it, but I will never watch it again.I can't say that I know tons about film. I have watched obscurities from ""Les Vampires"" to ""The Brown Bunny"". I do my best to embrace all forms of cinema. I try to accept certain films for what they are. I found it really hard to do that with ""El Topo"".The film is not shocking and feels extremely outdated. The symbolism is wildly overdone in a very amateurish fashion. It lacks any real character development or plot. But it's like watching a train wreck: you just can't stop yourself from looking.With a 3-D movie you were required to wear 3-D glasses, with ""El Topo"" you are required to be tripping on LSD.""El Topo"" just makes no sense at all. If you want to watch an obscure film that makes you think, and makes you think for days afterwords, watch ""Walkabout""."
62,El Topo,4,9 November 2013,Jodorowsky needs to work on his script with a sense of scholarship,"I am a great admirer of directors/scriptwriters who understand religious works before they make films that refer to religion (e.g., Kieslowsky, Tarkovsky, Mallick, Reygadas, Bunuel, Bergman, Dreyer, etc.). Jodorowsky, in this film, proved that he neither knew Christian scriptures nor Buddhist philosophy. The only detail that showed some scholarship was the discussion on the Jewish name Marah. Jodorowsky was trying to be very erudite in calling sections of the film (a) genesis (b) the prophets (c) the psalms and (d) the apocalypse. While the first and the last section have some remote connection to the Bible, the screenplay proves Jodorowsky's total lack of knowledge to either parody or discuss the similarities with the narratives of his screenplay. What did Jodowsky's psalms have that related to/or referred even obliquely to the Psalms of David?His knowledge of the Oriental scriptures is equally muddled--one savant seems to be fascinated with Egyptology, building pyramids with sticks and having a man with no arms carrying another without any feet. Some have called the work surrealist--it would be that only if Jodorowsky had showed a glimpse of scholarship beyond the etymology of Marah. Even blood splattered walls do not look authentic, nor do visuals of pigs rushing out of an empty place of worship. This is immature cinema--Hollywood's ""Freaks"" was far superior in content and so was Bunuel's surrealist works that criticized organized religion."
63,El Topo,6,7 January 2013,"Surreal, brilliant, exhausting","There's a fine line between surrealistic entertainment & absolute repulsion in Alejandro Jodorowsky's classic. It's a line that is very blurry. Jodorowsky wrote, directed and stars as a gunslinger who takes on the four best sharpshooters around. He succeeds...or does he? The film is not a western in any traditional sense, but is instead an outrageous head trip full of A LOT of blood, a lot of bible inspired mysticism and a fair amount of gratuitous nudity. Jodorowsky, looking very Christ-like, has barely any dialog (and neither does anyone else), but somehow this nightmare of a film moves along quickly. The production values are outstanding. It's stunningly photographed with great editing. The film is populated with perhaps one freak too many -- one's eyes get exhausted at some of the sights. You will, however, never see anything like this."
64,El Topo,6,6 August 2008,Masterpiece or X-rated MontyPython sketch?  You decide...,"It has been said that Jodorowsky's ""El Topo"" is like a Spaghetti Western directed by Luis Bunuel and who am I to argue, but you may find the excessive blood-letting, copious displays of nudity, (including a seven year-old boy), emphasis on all kinds of physical deformity and some girl-on-girl action more in keeping with an exploitation picture albeit one dressed up in some very fancy new clothes, (at least of the emperor's variety). There is also so much religious imagery and symbolism that it almost verges on the blasphemous.It's also a movie very much of it's time, (1970). There is no real narrative structure and its surrealism tends towards the psychedelic. It's a product of the drug-culture and its cult reputation stems mainly from those who were high when they first saw it. But there are certainly few films like it, (and any that are were probably directed by Jodorowsky). There are even those who hail it as a masterpiece. The magazine 'Films and Filming' voted it the best film of its year while others may feel it is closer to a Monty Python sketch or an X-rated version of ""Blazing Saddles"". In the end, it's a film that needs to be experienced; whether or not you 'like' it or even admire it is something else again."
65,El Topo,7,14 May 2007,Famed underground movie finally released,"El Topo is a famous cult movie well known historically as the movie that launched the Midnight Movie craze and aesthetically as a post-modern ""Western"" that takes on issues of mysticism, religion, and social-satire through compelling images of freaks, alternative sexuality, iconoclasm, no-holds-barred gore, and grotesquely obese women. It's not as good as it's fame will lead you to believe, but it's undeniably unforgettable.Many synopses sum this movie up as being about a gun-slinger mystic who takes on five of the world's best gun-fighters in the desert. That's, like, a third of the movie, and grossly underplays the importance of the rest of the film. However, it should be noted that that's also the most compelling and interesting of the movie, and that Jodorowsky's loose structure sometimes loses track of where it's going. To be sure, I was done with this movie a good half an hour before it was done with itself, though that's not to say there weren't more memorable moments to come. However, as a product definitely of the era and a post-modern look at mysticism and peace, it does deserve it's place as a challenging aesthetic that movie buffs and historians should see.If you liked this movie, my recommendation is to see Performance, a film contemporary to this one (though vastly different in nature) that was also as maltreated by distributors and that also recently got it's victorious DVD release. Between these two, you pretty much have mood of the late 60s/early 70s down.--PolarisDiB"
66,El Topo,10,9 April 2005,The picture displayed for the box is wrong,"The image displayed on the database for the Movie EL Topo is wrong. That image is for ""El Topo"", the puertorrican composer not the movie!I wish the movie was available on DVD. I saw it when it was released and it brings back so many memories. Does anyone know of any showings of this movie anywhere anymore. The images it shows create all kinds of thoughts, some religious, some surrealistic, some sexual but all kind of shocking. I suggest watching it under the influence of something!Please send me email at ray@rrassi.com for information on being able to view this again. Also I would like information on any more of his movies."
67,El Topo,9,8 January 2004,A Cult Movie,"What could i say about ""El Topo"" all the comments seems to point something true about it. some people wrote that el topo is a wierd movie, great movie, bad movie, religious movie, bloody, etc. but is in fact a cult movie. What is a cult movie?in my point of view is a movie that makes an impression in you for so many years that you want to watch it over and over again and is hard to find, it turns into a legend.I watched El Topo in its original version in spanish a couple nights ago, i own a VHS taken from what it looks to be a DVD because before the movie begins there´s a screen menu with some options; anyway, let me explain you some things about the spanish spoken version that makes it unique. there are some women in the movie with men voices i don´t know if in the english version is the same but it gives some sort of sick ages also there are some men like the master no. 1 that speaks like a woman and also some people in the town like the sheriff. In the church when they are praising the fake lord the chant is pretty bizarre it goes like this ""tu nos proteges señor"" over and over again with the leading voice of the sheriff lover (it looks like)a lady voice. When el topo leaves the son with the monks one of them says in a very gay voice ""llora niño que se apiade de ti"".I wonder how it feels like to watch it in a big screen. is a great movie as many people may say,watch it and enjoy it, you won´t be disappointed, but if you are expecting great sound and expensive special effects then you will be disappointed. El topo legend will continue when Jodorowsky finds money to film it ""the sons of el topo"" is called.El topo is an interesting example of how to make good movies with low budget especially in countries where the cinema industry is so bad like in Mexico product of the lack of interest in it. Let me give you some mexican titles that are great old movies and you can enjoy them as el topo. ""Satanico Pandemonium"", ""el libro de piedra"", ""Hasta el viento tiene miedo"", ""veneno para las Hadas"", ""viva la muerte""(spain), ""Rojo amanecer"", ""Pedro Paramo"", ""La vida inutil de pito perez"", ""el familiar"", ""la muerte deun burocrata"" (cuba),""la virgen de los sicarios"", ""satanasde mis amores"", buñuel movies, etc. I hope you can find them all and watch them in a dark room at midnight, pure culture and art vitamins. Try also movies from other countries there are thousands of great movies waiting to be discovered.If you visit mexico city don´t forget to visit la Cineteca de la UNAM or La cineteca Nacional you can find a lot of hard to find tittles at very low prices."
68,El Topo,9,20 February 2003,A Masterpiece,"While browsing through the shelves of the rubbish local DVD rental shop, I was rather surprised to come across this on DVD. I'd heard about this film and how rare it was supposed to be - I didn't even know it was available on DVD. It went back home with me, and I watched it last night.Bloody hell, it's good. It's one of the few movies which truly deserve the adjective ""dreamlike"" - thanks to Jodorowsky's direction and the stark cinematography, almost every scene is an unforgettable image. Perhaps the closest parallel I can draw to this is Kubrick's 2001, the only other film I can think of in which every scene is striking even if taken out of the context of the film. From the opening scene: the black leather-clad cowboy on the black horse in the harsh whiteness of the desert, to the end, we are presented with a sequence of images that are burned directly into memory: the village where a massacre has taken place, with the muddy streets awash with pools of blood reflecting the clear sky. El Topo handing his gun over to his seven-year-old son, instructing him to put the sole survivor out of his misery. I could go on, and on, and on.This is a movie that demands to be seen twice, three times and more. I've only managed a single viewing and it had to go back to the rental shop, and I can't honestly claim to have understood everything in the film at first viewing. It's a richly allegorical film, every scene is suffused with meaning that is only uncovered after the credits roll, when you're thinking about in bed before you fall asleep. It would be safe to say that this film will be a different experience for everyone who sees it - most will come away from this film with their own interpretation. Contrary to what I had been led to believe, it's even possible to simply enjoy it as an action-adventure Western, though that would be a gross missing of the point.Well, in short, I love it."
69,El Topo,10,30 November 2002,An important classic,"More than 3 decades after it was made, this is still one of the all-time strangest movies. The style is basically surrealist, including the customary anti-church aspects found in Bunuel's work. Beautiful Mexican desert scenery. You won't ever forget it."
70,El Topo,10,13 May 2002,"Long trip, born, death, rebirth, death...","It´s all about primal religion enveloped in to the christian myth. Masterpiece in a pictorical way too. This is not Buñuel but is may be the nearest. The crazy images of death, desert and uncommon characters are now part of the way we see horror. May not many people have seen this film but lot of now great directors have."
71,El Topo,10,26 April 2002,This film opens eyes on how it is necessary to shoot a film,"This film opens eyes on how it is necessary to shoot a film. The genius of the director is obviously traced both in a videoline, and in a soundtrack, and in selection of actors. This author's, noncommercial cinema made so, that authors of the most expensive blockbusters, spent millions dollars on shooting of films in which the budget is interesting only can envy him. Great force of cinema, will be with Jodorowsky!!!"
72,El Topo,9,14 February 2001,a new genre of cinema that anyone have succeed to imitate,"A devious gunfighter ( played by Jodorowsky himself ) travels through desert with two beautiful women and take us on a ride of hallucinating poetry , devastating surrealism , astounding violence and sex , he explores a strange world of total depravity , arrives in a town inhabited by a bunch of raving mads dedicating themselves to religious devotion for a satanic cult . Jodo created with this film not only a late night classic , a cult film for those who love unconventionnal filmaking , but also a genuine new genre , some kind of a strange spaghetti western steeped in surrealism and psychedelic spirituality ."
73,El Topo,9,15 August 2000,Masterful and inspirational film,"This film caught me by surprise. It has depth, character and evolution unlike any typical Western I can readily recall. Each biblically titled chapter has a punch line that tempts the viewer to pause the film and consider what just transpired, even challenges the viewer to consider the ironies, compromises and tough calls the character does or deliberately does not make. Although the pacing speaks to a past time of longer attention spans, in the end I can only shake my head with respect and awe for the genius of it all. Fantastic, a film any aspiring director should see before setting out to do any work of real substance, or at least, before trying to do anything honest, deep, challenging or epic. -e"
74,El Topo,,25 July 2000,"Not a trip, but a make-love-not-war statement weighed down by meaning.","Glad to have seen at last this 'invisible' film from an almost invisible filmmaker. Found it slow, very violent and symbolic. But not bizarre, LSD-like or a weird trip - as it is so often described. It's intentions seem to me sometimes to be too clear. El Topo starts out as a gunman solving problems with bullets; he learns in the end about humility and love. Only after 90 mins. does the turnaround occur, I did not count the gunfights and cruel deaths. But in the end that turns out to be exactly what it's all about. I must say I liked mr. Jodorowsky much better as a bald headed street comedian than as a gunslinger. As was intended."
75,El Topo,,25 May 2000,Reduced by Time,"This film is too dated to have the effect it had in 1971. It was 'The' cult classic of the 70's, but by 2000 it's punch is lost. Made for (or under hallucinagenics) it is too slow for todays audiences.  What I found freaky or weird then is just mindless or infantile now."
76,El Topo,,18 February 2000,"A seminal film.  Like it or not, this film has shaped the imagination of those who shape the imagination of today through the magic of cinema.","First seen when it was released ( and that dates me!) , I can still recall how this particular movie  - amongst a host of prententious (AKA ""BORING"")movies of the early 70's - captured my imagination and restored my faith that cinema could still disturb, confront and lay claim to being a unique art form.  See this one for it's place in film history - consider what were it's contemporaries, and see it as an example of how the power of myth still can enthrall, and how it is not necessary for linear logic to divert and entertain.  We are not all that far removed from those early people who ( with a frisson of fear) saw shifting shadows on a (cave) wall - in this film, let it's Director (Jodorowsy) allow you too too be amazed and mystified.  This is a film for those willing to suspend their belief in ""reality"" and allow themselves to experience a magical reality.  But be warned that this film is  - in my opinion - disturbing and confronting. Caveats aside, those who do not know this movie will find much to ponder if they have an interest in how the style and content of contemporary cinema has evolved."
77,El Topo,,9 February 2016,I Didn't Love the Film But It's Certainly Unique,"El Topo (1970) *** (out of 4) Often considered the king of the midnight movies, Alejandro Jodorowsky's EL TOPO is part Spaghetii Western and part avant garde madness. El Topo (Jodorowsky) is a mysterious gunfighter dressed in black who shows up out of nowhere and must go up against four other gunfighters.EL TOPO is a rather miraculous movie in the fact that it became a huge box office success across the world. I say it's a wonder this happened because there really aren't any other movies quite like this one and there's no question that Jodorowsky has a certain flair for cinema and there's also no doubt that his vision is something no one could try to recreate. Part Bunuel, part madness, EL TOPO is an ultra-violent film that manages to be about whatever is going on in the viewer's mind.I'm not going to sit here and call this film a masterpiece like so many have. Yes, I'm sure many potheads and acid trippers saw this in the theater back in the day and was blown away by it. You also have the likes of John Lennon and Roger Ebert who called this a masterpiece so there's no question that a wide range of people love this movie. While I didn't love it I can at least respect what the director was going for, which was pure madness.I think the best thing that can be said about the film is that it has a unique look that isn't like any other movie ever made. The film benefits from the non-stop violence that runs throughout the picture and each death is usually done with a ton of gore coming out of the bullet wounds. People call George Romero or Lucio Fulci the Godfather of Gore but it could be said that the realistic violence and over-the-top gore started right here.As for the story, there really isn't one. The viewer could draw countless conclusions as to what the film is about and not one explanation would be better or worse than another. Personally I thought the film ran on way too long and at times I found it to be quite boring. Still, the originality factor alone makes EL TOPO something everyone should see at least once."
78,El Topo,10,27 September 2008,Eastern Meets Western,"First of all, this film has been described by it's own writer/director, Alexandro Jodorowsky as a psychedelic drug (""I ask of film what most people ask of psychedelic drugs""). That aside, El Topo is a surreal, dreamy journey of inner self realization. It is also a blood soaked, ultra violent assault on the senses. The choice of partaking said such psychedelic drugs before seeing this is your own choice. It has been described by some as a Zen western, a drug induced homage to Sergio Leone,as well as others. Jodorowsky has made several other films just as bizarre & surreal as El Topo, but due to spotty distribution, are not as well known. This film was discovered by John Lennon in 1970, who begged his then manager Allen Klein to distribute the film in the U.S., where it mostly played to stoned out hippies in the early 1970's at midnight screenings. The film then disappeared for years (sometimes turning up on bootlegged VHS video copies),and was rescued from obscurity by Jodorowsky, himself who oversaw a new print struck, and distributed out of his own pocket. If you can find an art house cinema that is screening it (midnight or otherwise),check it out. No MPAA rating here, but contains some pretty nasty ultra violence (including an actual rape carried out on film). You have been informed."
79,El Topo,8,6 February 2008,Well...,"""El Topo"" is a film that's something of an acquired taste, I'm sure. It's a very allegorical film, and some would call it outright bizarre, and they'd be correct. But, that isn't a bad thing.Essentially, the film is a skewed Western, starting with the line: ""You are seven years old. You are a man now. Bury your first toy and a picture of your mother,"" and ending with the son taking his father's place (after his father has immolated himself), riding off into the sunset, so to speak, with his own little boy. The main character, the titular El Topo, through the course of the film, undergoes a metamorphosis from a weary, sometimes disturbingly so, gunfighter to something of a Buddhist Jesus figure, and in one of the more disturbing shots, we pick up on him, years later, in a meditative state, hair on end and wearing lipstick and rouge. To say this film isn't for the casual film-viewer sounds very pretentious, but it's the truth. It's sometimes befuddling, sometimes extremely psychedelic, very allegorical, and undoubtedly disturbing. But, for all that, it's worth watching.John Lennon cited it as one of his favorite films, so that should maybe be enough for some. Myself, I just like Jodorowsky's stuff. I'd also recommend ""Santa Sangre,"" or ""El Montana Sagrada."""
80,El Topo,8,14 May 2007,"I wouldn't call this a great movie, but it's definitely a must-see. It's finally on DVD in Region 1!","Saw this several years ago on a VHS bootlegged from the Japanese, blurred-pubes laser disc. It's probably because of the lousy format that I hardly remember a thing about it. Finally, after years of waiting, it gets released in Region 1 in a super-deluxe box set from Anchor Bay, which also includes The Holy Mountain, Fando y Lis, an early short (La Cravate), full-length commentaries, a feature documentary about director Alejandro Jodorowsky, and the soundtracks to both El Topo and The Holy Mountain. Talk about an awesome package! And for only $30 on Deep Discount DVD. This may just be the DVD of the year. As for the film itself, while I may not remember it very well, I remember my reaction to it, and my opinion is mostly unchanged. It's a product of its acid-laced time, and the film itself is mostly just silly and pretty much the definition of weird for the sake of weird. That's not to say I dislike it, however. Oh no, I can appreciate weird for the sake of weird, and this is a very entertaining movie in that respect. It also has some of the most amazing and imaginative images ever committed to film. My favorite sequence is probably the rabbit corral."
81,El Topo,8,17 April 2007,An astonishing piece of work,"I have had the great good fortune to see this movie in a local cinema, and I have to say I don't think I've ever spent so long with my mouth hanging open.Almost every reviewer has made some comparison to other works just to try and describe El Topo, and so here's my take: imagine a Western co-written by Lewis Carroll and the Monty Python team, co-directed by Terry Gilliam, Sergio Leone and Ingmar Bergman, and with design by Salvador Dali and Heironymous Bosch. Then further imagine that all of the above sat down beforehand and took very generous quantities of suspect powders and tablets, and there you have it.There is a story, inasmuch as there is a strand of activity, although even that falters at times. But there is as little to aide one as to meaning as there is in the blankest of poetry.There are plenty of awful clichés, some very rough camera work and editing, and great dollops of atrocious acting, but there are also inspired moments, amazing performances and some of the most awesome cinematic images I have ever seen.And a lot of it is very funny. Like the 'hero' being run over by a dam-burst of the physically disabled and deformed pouring from a hole in a mountain. It's like that, you see. From the very first scene of the typically black-clad gunfighter riding across the desert, when you realise that he has a completely naked small boy riding pillion, you'll find massacre victims spitted on 30-foot poles, Buddhist gunslingers who tragically believe themselves beyond defeat, women dubbed with gruff men's voices, gay sheriffs, and even a village priest whose sermons involve getting the congregation to play Russian Roulette.As to spirituality, there is lots said in review (and by the director)about the film's inherent orientalism, but I have to say, dead Buddhists aside, that there seems to be a lot more of the Bible in here than anything else, although if it IS an allegory, I'm stuck as to what it might be. You will notice on the way past, however, references to John the Baptist, Jesus, Daniel and the Lion, Samson, and loads more besides.Everyone should see this movie before they die. Just make sure you view it sober."
82,El Topo,7,17 April 2007,It's all about the imagery,"Regarded as a masterpiece by some, including Dennis Hopper, the late John Lennon and George Harrison, this is the very definition of a cult film. A violent, surrealist, allegorical underground sensation upon its release 37 years ago, the film has been out of print since - existing only in poor quality bootleg videos. Now the film is finally being released on DVD and is currently on an exclusive cinema run around the UK.To me, it's not very easy to love surrealism. It's easy to respect it and even easier to hate it all. But one things for sure, it certainly makes quite an impact. Many images from this surrealist Mexican pseudo-biblical western will stay with me for a long time, no matter how ridiculous I thought it was at first. The images contained in this film include a man being buried in dead rabbits, a man with no legs being carried on the back of a man with no arms, several dozen black and Mexican men being branded with hot irons and sold as slaves, a group of deformed and disabled people being mercilessly gunned down by a group of morally-twisted cross-dressing townsfolk, a man catching a bullet in a butterfly net and throwing it back at his opponent, and a nail-bitingly tense game of Russian roulette in a church. As with all surrealism, for every image to laugh at and ridicule, there is one to be utterly floored by due to it's undeniable power.The imagery and symbolism permeate every scene of this film, sometimes bluntly and sometimes more subtly. Elements of Judeo-Christianity include the four duellists representing the four prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel) and El Topo himself as Jesus Christ, whilst the latter half of the film can be seen to show the reincarnation beliefs of Tibetan Buddhism.As the round of applause from the audience at the end of the film tonight showed, this is a profoundly powerful and daring film but it is definitely not for everyone. It is somewhat dated and perhaps a little flawed. But as El Topo himself says, ""Too much perfection is a mistake."""
83,El Topo,7,28 December 2004,early seventies rumors about  El Topo,"Perhaps I am passing some urban myths with these statements. I saw the movie in 1970. Supposedly 52 tanker truck loads of cattle blood were used it the filming of this movie. The rape scene is not acting. Jodorowski actually raped the woman and then negotiated with her in order to put it in the movie. Further he actually kicked the son in the balls. The last piece of information that circulated in those days was that the movie was banned in Mexico. I will not attest to any of these statements. Perhaps another might comment on the voracity of them.Jodorowski said of the movie that he was trying to capture the logic of dreams when he made the movie. He was trying to put his audience inside this dream or nightmare , if you prefer.I have been looking for this movie ever since VHS came out without success. hopefully your viewers comments here will help me locate it."
84,El Topo,10,20 August 2004,Highly layered symbolic vision,"Initially set up as a western movie in the manner of Sergio Leone, the film soon slips out into surprising metaphysical realms. A gunslinging avenger (El Topo; played by the director himself) defeats a local militant tyrant, castrating him and stealing his female lover away into the open desert, leaving his naked son in the care of monks. Goaded on by the woman who becomes increasingly demanding, El Topo (who calls himself ""God"") faces down several holy men, cheating to win. Not satisfied, the woman finds a sadistic female lover, and turns on El Topo, shooting him several times. El Topo is reborn as a genorous selfless man in a cave full of mutants whom he helps to escape from their enclosed incestuous existence. Reuniting with his now grown son and working with a dwarf woman in the local town to earn money, El Topo finally frees the mutants but on their road to freedom they are massacred. El Topo takes out his revenge on the townsfolk and burns himself alive, leaving his son, the dwarf and an infant behind who ride off into the desert to whatever destiny awaits them. This film is so saturated with meanings, it can be talked about for days if not years. It has haunted me as few films have. Beneath the multiple shocks of the first viewing, there is much careful metaphoric construction which opens outward the more it is pondered."
85,El Topo,7,8 August 1999,Am I so jaded? Where's the gore?,"I watch this film expecting to see the sickest, most violent movie I would ever see ... but I didn't. Where was it?  Someone tell me. Am I so numb to the world that I no longer notice? I didn't necessarily see the movie for that reason, I was just warned of it beforehand. Too much hype? Maybe.The movie is great, unique and definitely worth seeing (more than once actually -- it takes repetition to catch the full meaning). See it ... but unless you have a weak heart, you won't find the violence overwhelming."
86,El Topo,,22 May 2001,"This is, without ANY doubt, the weirdest film I have EVER seen. Naked midgets, etc.","It would be impossible to make a stranger film.  An LSD trip on film? Sure. This is IT.  The most weird, strange, bizzare film I have ever seen, without any doubt.  Would I like to see it again?  Sure.  I saw it when it was first released and I'd like to see it again, now. How? Where?  I was surprised to see it come up when I did a search here!I cannot remember the plot (was there one?), but I do remember the naked midgets!  Maybe this says more about me than about the movie.  I am open to that idea!"
87,El Topo,8,10 December 1999,Baffling and unforgettable,"Jodorowsky is nothing if not an idiosyncratic filmmaker, and this is probably the ideal starting point for his singular flights of fancy.  The tightrope that this movie walks from first frame to last is almost unparalleled in modern cinema.""El Topo"" is as pretentious as it is meaningful and as baffling as it is gripping.  In a way it is an examination of various religions of the world (particularly Eastern ones), in another way it is a tribute to Bunuel and the surrealists, in another way it's simply an insane LSD vision.  No matter which of these you walk in expecting, you'll be satisfied.It is unfortunate that a key scene in the film is missing, which does play havoc with some of the character motivations (though there is no conventional ""plot"", what's motivating the characters most of the time is VERY clear).  Even with this omission, the film has a power and grace which few epics (let alone controversial ""midnight cult"" features) have achieved. 
I do own a copy of what is probably a ""grey market"" videocassette of the film taken from a Japanese laserdisc, and the image quality is generally not bad (it never was great with this movie, anyway).  Plus, those Japanese subtitles sure are interesting!"
88,El Topo,5,8 September 2011,El Topo (The Mole),"This Spanish language film I spotted because it was featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I wasn't sure what I would make of it before I watched, but I am glad I did. Basically El Topo (Alejandro Jodorowsky, also writing and directing) is the cowboy riding his horse with his naked six year old son riding with him, and they are burying childhood photos and objects in the desert sand to make the boy a man. Journeying back they come across a massacre of blood and bodies, all killed by bandits, and deciding he is something of a God he decides he should get revenge for these people, including killing the fat bald Colonel. After leaving his son in the care of some monks, El Topo rides off with Mara (Mara Lorenzio) whom the Colonel kept as a slave, and she encourages him to kill four guns-men to be the greatest in the land, but he ends up feeling guilty afterwards. After being shot by another woman and Mara abandoning him he is dragged away by some dwarfs and mutants, and years later he is in a cave full of deformed outcasts who have made him their God. They only have one way out of the cave, and El Topo decides to help them escape, and he also forms a lover relationship with a dwarf girl, and then he wants money for dynamite. El Topo's grown up son finds him and threatens to kill him for abandoning him, but after he allows the outcasts to get out, and he succeeds in creating an exit that all the people flood out of. In the end he does gets some mortal wounds from the cultists, but he ignores these and sees his girlfriend give birth, only to die and go into a grave covered in a beehive, and El Topo's son, the girlfriend and the baby ride away. I will be honest, the story is rather complicated and anyone including may get confused and not understand, most of it is a collection of bizarre images, ideas and situations. This is called the cult film fan's cult film, I can certainly see that it won't be to everyone's taste, but it is certainly in many ways near essential viewings, if you are one for films with a lot of blood and weirdness, then this is for you, a good surreal spaghetti western. Worth watching!"
89,El Topo,2,4 May 2012,Bad acting and script,"El Topo looks like an early cut of a David Lynch project. The title character is also the director, Alejandro Jodorowsky, who at the beginning, looks like Zorro, dressed in black, riding a horse with his naked young son on board trekking through the desert of Mexico. They come across a group of dead bodies and the Latino Dirty Harry finds the perpetrators and kills them all, including their leader, the colonel, whose slave he rescues and names Mara. He leaves his kid at a mission and begins a quest to defeat four great gunmen. He conquers all of them, but feels guilty and throws away his weapons to seek a more peaceful life. Mara leaves him after he is shot down and then carried off by dwarfs and other odd people. El Topo wakes up in a cave with the strange assortment of freaks worshiping him as a deity. He meets a midget woman and they become lovers. She becomes pregnant and he puts together a plan to escape from the cave. By the time the movie ends, I was not impressed with the bad acting or horrendous script; avoid El Topo at all costs."
90,El Topo,6,1 April 2008,Not as awesome as they say but good nevertheless.,"How does one write a review for El Topo? It is such a personal experience that I will write my own opinion of the movie.For certain, I was chuckling almost throughout the film but it was not because of the jokes on screen but due to the unreal sequences and nonsense that was going on. I loved the way the people spouted blood. I also loved the bizarre courtship rituals. However I am pretty certain that in most of these scenes Jodorowski was trying to create a very serious environment. For instance the scene with the exploitation of the monks was intended to be shocking and a serious comment on society; but it turns out to be hilarious due to the bad acting and bizarreness.Some more things that I gathered was that the director was fairly chauvinistic and egoistic. What with writing a film and casting oneself as an all-powerful messiah who is irresistible to women and unbeatable in gun fights. Not to mention highly philosophical and a saviour. Ah, talking of women, they are nothing more than objects rather than humans. They are depicted as dogs that are meant for satisfaction and the worship of men. I'm not too sure where the director was trying to go with this.I am a big fan of surreal art; however surrealism is an attempt towards straightening out preconceived societal norms and blind faith. I am not too certain what comment was the director trying to make in this film. All I gathered was that he was self-indulgent and trying to depict himself the way he saw himself in his own eyes, as a superior alpha-male, which shows his huge ego.Towards the end I started falling asleep and couldn't wait for it to get over. I thought that the movie was half-an-hour too long and it couldn't maintain my interest for 2 hours.Would I watch the movie again, I probably would because it is indeed very funny. However I'm not too certain if I'd like to give The Holy Mountain a go primarily because I presume that it also will be as religious as this one was. So a good attempt and I'd recommend this movie to others interested in bizarre films; however its not one of the greatest ones I've seen. Funny though........I saw The Holy Mountain 2 weeks after writing this review and was absolutely stunned by it. Certainly far superior in quality, grandeur and bravado than this one. Cheers."
91,El Topo,5,19 June 2002,Sorry I don't get it,This was supposed to be a cult film based on the book of Genisis from the Bible.Sorry the gunfighter doesn't do it for me.Its hard to follow and seems overly violent and overstated.It never lives up to the promise of the opening scene where a boy becomes a man in the hardest terms. Pass it by
92,El Topo,8,25 August 2015,Bizarre Masterpiece,"A mysterious black-clad gunfighter (Alejandro Jodorowsky) wanders a mystical Western landscape encountering multiple bizarre characters.Phil Hardy wrote, ""Rather in the manner of Federico Fellini, whose self-conscious conflation of the roles of charlatan and ringmaster of the unconscious Jodorowsky apes, the film is a breathtaking concoction of often striking, but more often ludicrous, images. The result is a movie that, though it impressed many at the time of its original release, in retrospect is clearly a minor, albeit often very funny work."" Hardy is among good company. The critics largely thought it was an empty film, and it was rejected by the Academy to even be considered as a nominee for Foreign Film.Roger Ebert is more positive, including it as one of his Great Movies. And he is right. Alongside ""Holy Mountain"", Jodorowsky creates a world that must be seen to be believed. Maybe it can not all be understood and maybe it is not meant to be understood, but he was making beautiful and strange films years before the modern masters (e.g. Lynch) even got started."
93,El Topo,6,26 August 2013,Surreal yet compelling...,"I found this one a little difficult to follow, but at the same time it was quite a compelling watch. The connections between the three acts of the plot are, at times, quite hard to knit together, but it does all tie up in the end. Very bloody and quite daring (for its time) with quite a bit of nudity; I can imagine it was a little controversial, to say the least, on release. I won't say too much about the performances, but needless to say I couldn't find too much to complain about. I can't say I understood much of the religious allegory that was mentioned in the blurb, but it was entertaining enough.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.3/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
94,El Topo,10,29 December 2012,underground Mexico,"""El Topo"" is one movie that will probably not leave people neutral. Alejandro Jodorowsky's underground masterpiece about a gunfighter on a quest for enlightenment almost seems like a joke given the over-the-top violence, but is one of the most impressive pieces of work. I figure that the movie very likely irritated the religious authorities due to one scene in particular. But the movie is truly something that you have to see to believe. It's sort of half-western, half-mysticism, with the main character's journey mirroring the efforts of a mole to find the light. It's easily the sort of movie that Quentin Tarantino could've directed. Overall, one might call ""El Topo"" the supreme rejection of the John Wayne type of westerns. If in fact Jodorowsky ever gets around to making a sequel, I'll be eager to see how he continues the story. Really good movie."
95,El Topo,8,3 September 2012,Mind blowing surreality,"Writer, director, and actor Alejandro Jodorowsky's definitive cult Western is not a film that should be missed. It's a cerebral, surreal, and existential experience that will make you turn your head in confusion and widen your eyes in mystical awe. Jodorowsky stars as the title character, El Topo, a man wandering through the desert in search of spiritual enlightenment. He travels with his young son, played by Jodorowsky's real son Brontis, in search of four warrior masters that he must duel to complete his trans formative journey. But that's only the beginning. There's a lot more going on in El Topo that you have to experience for yourself.El Topo is the film that began the cult craze of Midnight Movies. These were taboo indie films screened at small independent theaters at midnight. El Topo established this midnight movie genre as something violent, strange, and disturbingly enthralling for the viewer. The film is an experience like no other, even if it is difficult to decipher just what it all means.Personally, I was awed by El Topo, but I didn't like it as much as Jodorowsky's next film, The Holy Mountain. El Topo is far more out there than The Holy Mountain, and it is increasingly difficult to grasp the purpose and the concept of the film as it gets stranger and stranger. Of course, this was the brain wracking spiritual experience Jodorowsky intended for the film, so he deserves plenty of kudos for making such a surreal mind freak of a film. It's independent filmmaking on a genius level that works on levels rarely explored in cinema.El Topo is truly cinema as a surreal art form. It may not all make sense, but that's what repeated viewings are for. I can't wait to watch El Topo a few more times to collect the interpretive meaning of the film in my mind. There's so much that El Topo has to offer, and it can definitely be a little overwhelming on the first viewing. But you can expect a mystical and almost magical experience when you watch this film."
96,El Topo,10,17 December 2010,The Vivid Sky In El Topo,"I've been wanting to see this movie ever since I first heard that it was played only after midnight at the Elgin. I finally got my chance the other night, ... and it was excellent, beautiful, grotesque, violent, inspiring, haunting, gritty, meaningful, symbolic, bloody, light, dark, and simply amazing. I don't get the criticism I read and hear a lot about this film, I absolutely love it! If you haven't seen this masterpiece, do not watch it unless you're alone.(Unless you absolutely know the people or person you watch it with would be quiet so you have the chance to see this with an open mind and absorb it in it's entirety hence this film is definitely not for everyone.) So, after that introduction on why I love this film and why it's probably one of the best films to date, I'll write my review the only way one possibly could write a review for El Topo...for those who have seen it and for those who have not......Watch it."
97,El Topo,10,6 December 2010,Whats with those old lady's?,"The first A.J. flick i saw was ""The Holy Mountain"" it was at some random party thrown on some t.v. slightly to the middle of the room. People were mainly talking and not paying attention, but i was stunned. Despite the fact that the films are fictional, what these actor's and actress's do is totally amazing. I've never seen more haggard people doing so many depraved things in my life. Let me run a few words by that come to mind when thinking of this movie, western, Illuminati, vile acts, rape, religion, death, blood, death, people who are physically deformed, rage, the all seeing eye, gunfight showdown, bloodbath and the new world order. Watching this movie makes me want to stop eating meat, what I'm saying is it's powerful stuff that will make you think about lot's of things all at once, so strap yourself in for a true viewing experience. Ten stars."
98,El Topo,7,11 November 2010,"Blood, Bunnies, and Midgets","Those are a few of the things you will see in this movie. This film is hard to wrap your head around at times. There are scenes where characters change roles and appearance between shots, that change rather quickly. This isn't the reason the film is hard to wrap your head around. A lot of it has to do with the religious imagery. The film is filled with it as well as several bible verses. It seems as though different points are being made at different points in the movie, and that those points point to other matters which don't exist in the film. Starting to get the point? The film takes a more typical western feel near the beginning with the black gunman (EL Topo). This segment of the movie is action film and has a lot of the hooks of Western Genre Films (as well as 70's art house hooks). Later on the film takes a very different turn and feels a lot less like a western. Our main character acts and looks completely differently and his motivations are almost opposite in every way. We only feel the story cutting back together as El Topo reunites with a character earlier in the movie.The film has a superb visual flair and is littered with many types of religious imagery and symbolism. Whether it all makes sense to you or only some of it does, the film is well worth the journey."
99,El Topo,8,22 May 2009,One Whacked Out Western!,"I went into this expecting it to be just another gritty spaghetti western and was hit with something way gnarlier.(it was made in Mexico so i guess it'd be a burrito western) For one thing it's way bloodier than most movies of it's time and being a big fan of grit and splatter this came as a real treat. The bloodshed, however, is not the most unusual element of this venture into bizzaro world. The plot is hard to explain because it totally changes half way through the movie. It also has some fantasy/religious/cult elements that are way out the norm for westerns. All I can say is that El Topo is the vision of a mad man. It's got lesbianism, emasculation, midget breasts, butt-rape, slavery, tons of deformed people, and even a little kid getting his head blown off. If you like westerns and wanna see one hell of a trippy movie i'd definitely recommend it but be forewarned that it does have some pretty graphic scenes"
100,El Topo,,5 October 2008,Hopper and Lynch Wish They Were Jodorowsky...,"While watching Alejandro Jodorowsky's cult classic ""El Topo,"" one would think this is a film David Lynch would have taken Dennis Hopper to on a date. Following a lone gunfighter on his quest for spiritual enlightenment, Jodorowsky creates a world filled with sexual desire, barren environments and, most effectively, violence. While it would be easy to dismiss El Topo as an exercise in surreal film-making (the kind one would expect from a filmmaker in 1970), it is undeniable that many of the scenes land with striking resonance, and will stay with you long after the movie has ended. The film is packed with symbolism leading back to eastern philosophy as well as Catholic dogma--allowing a comparison between the two forms of thought. Since the film is broken up into two parts (the first being the gunfighter's literal quest, the second being an escape from perdition), the exploration of revenge and human nature are depicted in great depth. Jodorowsky' use of animals is reminiscent of movies like ""4"" and the fact that whenever an act of violence occurs in this film an animal noise or cutaway to a beast is shown. To modern audiences with an ounce of cinema knowledge, this won't seem like a revolutionary technique, because it's not. However, when one looks at the time in which the film was made, it's hard not to place it among films such as ""The Last Movie"" for being completely audacious. ""El Topo is perhaps more effective as a film used to convey the feelings of the time it was made, as well as a way to show what the medium was about during the 1970's. If one were to teach a cinema class about where film was going during the 60's and 70's (and where it ultimately didn't go thanks to people like Lucas, Spielberg and Coppola) ""The Last Movie"" and ""El Topo"" would be required viewing. It is interesting how these two film correspond to each other, and how both are about loners searching for truth, while only discovering inevitable bloodshed."
101,El Topo,8,30 July 2008,The Tale Of How Mole's Got Their Blindness,"""You must bury a picture of your mother and your favorite toy, before you can become a man..."", says Alejandro Jodorowsky to a naked infant as he rides through the desert in all black with an umbrella.El Topo(The Mole), is a story about one lone gunslingers quest to become the greatest of all killers, along the way he encounters and duels several ""masters"", until he reaches the final stage, where the most enlightened of all masters, kills himself.Distraught the lone gunmen, goes underground where he meets a group of kindly deformed people who have never been to the surface...The best way to explain the rest may be to mention another scene in a Jodorowsky film, The Holy Mountain, where the thief gives food to a group of starving children, at which the alchemist scoffs and asks if he wants to see what would happen if he tried to feed them all, and the alchemist makes dozens of loaves of bread appear. The children began fighting over the food, snarling at each other, etc. The Alchemist tells the thief, ""all the food in the world is useless if they are not ready to share"".If you haven't seen the movie yet, ignore that, but if you have think about the mole going into the light prematurely and blinding itself at the beginning (and others ancient stories of Caves and temporary blindness?), about what the gunmen is attempting to do for the people underground, and why it goes wrong? Anyway it's food for thought. Don't take anything about this film literally.Surreal, allegorical, violent, and sensory pounding, take on the Sphagetti Western and Samurai tale, set in the Mexican desert. Wasn't available in the states for years until very recently, if you get the chance, see it"
102,El Topo,7,20 April 2008,Not your daddy's western,"I watched a couple of westerns this week and neither are what you would call typical. This one certainly isn't like anything I saw on Saturday mornings growing up.Alejandro Jodorowsky is definitely a surrealist, and incorporates many different religious themes in this film. Basically, it is about a man searching for spirituality. He encounters all these different religious ideas. Now, that is just my interpretation, as the basic idea of Jodorowsky, who wrote directed and starred in the film, is that everyone gets their own meaning from it. (He also designed the costumes and sets and composed music for the film.)He will not reveal his thinking on the film.Don't look for any ""stars"" as most of the people in the film only appeared in this one film. It was shot in Mexico and the cinematography by Rafael Corkidi is brilliant.It is not a film in the traditional sense, but something to be experienced."
103,El Topo,,29 December 2007,"Vivid and visionary philosophical ""western"" that points the finger at the peace and love generation cast adrift.","El Topo was director Alejandro Jodorowsky's second feature film - following the low-budget surrealist parable Fando and Lis in 1967 - and, as a result of its violent content and scenes of grotesque symbolism, was the first film to bring him to the attention of a western audience. At its heart, the film is a violent and deeply mystical dream-play about a mythical gunfighter cleansing himself of the violence of his past, only to discover that the world itself has already been corrupted by the bloodshed of the present (with the film making barbed cultural references to the escalating violence of the twentieth century; with the atrocities of the holocaust, the violence of the Spanish Civil War, the massacres of Vietnam and the escalating tensions in the middle-east all informing the heavily-stylised and overruling spirit of anger and aggression).With this in mind it is important to point out that despite the sense of violence and the scenes that seem to be intentionally designed to provoke a drastic reaction from the audience the film is in no way lurid or exploitative; with Jodorowsky placing the violence alongside Eastern philosophies, religious symbolism, situationist-inspired absurdity and a genuine sense of compassion; with his aggression being more of an existentialist scream of pain and torment, as opposed to one of masochistic excess. The film also explores a number of mystical themes that would be later fleshed out even further with The Holy Mountain, Jodorowsky's second of only three films produced in the 1970's, which, much like the film in question, unfolds through a series of surrealist vignettes, rife with the aforementioned factors of religious symbolism, sardonic satire and distancing cinematic shock tactics.As with The Holy Mountain it remains a film that polarises audience to this day, with El Topo, to some, remaining a monumental achievement of philosophy, mysticism and surrealist satire (according to some; a film capable of changing the viewer's entire perspective on life itself through the wisdom of its central character and the potency of its imagery). To others however, the film has already become something of a dated relic, with some viewers arguing that the cartoon-like violence, casual nudity and notions of questing for inner peace and tranquillity have become throwbacks to the late 1960's flower-power aesthetic; which is always easy to discredit through blind cynicism (although this is the point).So, with these considerations in place, you'll no doubt be asking yourself how you'll react to the film on a personal level, and - if I'm being completely honest - then I couldn't possibly say. I will say however that it's best to approach the film with an open mind and with some familiarity with other films of this nature (surreal, deeply metaphorical art-house cinema) as well as with Jodorowsky himself.What surprised me the most when viewing this film for the first time was the tremendous amount of depth that can often be lost within the giddy barrage of sights and sounds that burst from the screen in a vibrant vivid collage of philosophy, art, sex and religion. As a result, I often find it annoying when people discredit Jodorowsky as simply throwing images on the screen to shock and disarm the viewer for no apparent reason. I find similar arguments regarding the work of filmmakers like David Lynch, Shinya Tsukamoto and Miike Takashi similarly offencive. Simply listen to the audio commentary on this DVD to hear Jodorowsky taking the film apart image by image; explaining the incredible amount of minor details purged from every religion, steeped in every form of art and combined in an attempt to overload the audience's senses and perceptions to effectively change the very fabric of their own personal universe. It worked for me, though as you can possibly gather from the previous reviews, opinions are mixed.As you can imagine from the sketchy plot outline, what follows is fairly episodic in design, sometimes tapping into the cinematic absurdity of Luis Bunuel and at other times reminding me of the epic opulence of early Ken Russell (in particular, films like The Devils, The Music Lovers, The Boyfriend, Mahler, etc). For the most part though, the film is pure Jodorowsky, with the central character (played by the director himself) tapping into the intensity of The Holy Mountain's iconic shaman-esquire leader; whilst the constant barrage of cripples, dwarfs, freaks and geeks cut adrift against a backdrop of raped priests, slaughtered villages, philosophical gun-play and an all-mighty sense of fury as the world of peace and love comes crumbling down as a harsh-reminder of the character's once violent past, all stand out as a testament to the pure, unbridled genius of Jodorowsky himself.Obviously, it's not going to be a film for everyone, but those already turned on to Jodorowsky's ideas will no doubt take away a great deal from the film's central message, and from the dizzying kaleidoscope of visual ideas, interpretations and sight gags that explode from the screen in a veritable barrage of colour and movement. The Tartan DVD features some fine extra features, most notably Jodorowsky's informative and fascinating audio commentary, while also doing a fairly great - if not quite perfect - job of re-mastering a film that has remained in the vaults for well over thirty years."
104,El Topo,8,7 December 2007,Some movies can't be described in words.,"Some movies are just impossible to describe and are something you really need to experience for yourself. ""El Topo"" is perhaps one of the weirdest, most surrealistic but also most beautiful movie experiences you'll ever experience.The movie began extremely well and amusing and I liked were the movie was heading to. It was amusing and unusual. I must admit the movie sort of went downhill for me after that, when the movies just got weirder and weirder and less and less things made sense any more. But nevertheless the whole experience and journey of the movie makes this a more than worthwhile one. A real cult western!It's violent, it's graphic, it has nudity but all set in a surrealistic world, with surrealistic characters and events, so you just know that it's all going to be something special and unusual, rather than just something that tries to shock and also without ever getting over pretentious.It's a beautifully shot and directed movie. Director Alejandro Jodorowsky did not only directed this, he also played the lead role, wrote, composed, was the production designer and costume designer of the movie. So this movie is completely his work and vision. It's not hard to see why he has such a big and impressive following.It's hard to describe or say what the movie is about or what Alejandro Jodorowsky tries to achieve with it. It's more a viewing experience that everyone undergoes differently and different conclusion and meanings from it can be drawn by everyone individually. I think this was also Jodorowsky's point.A true one of a kind movie experience you have to see and undergo for yourself.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
105,El Topo,8,29 September 2007,How the West was Surreal,"I have been a fan of Santa Sangre ever since it first came out in theaters. (I have been eagerly awaiting its release on DVD) When El Topo was released on DVD I snapped it up right away and gave it a watch last night.First off, knowing the time period this movie came from, I have to say that Jodorowski was years ahead of his time. That said, I think many of his images and intent owe as much to Dali and Dada artists than to other filmmakers. The scene where the rabbit pyre bursts into flames is pure surreal imagery. It was at this moment that I decided: I like this film.It does seem as if this is two films spliced together. The first half is a revenge story/spiritual quest (if tracking down people and killing them can be seen as spiritual) This half seems less successful in its narrative and approach than the second half of the film.The second half finds the re-invented and shorn El Topo rescuing a community of in-bred freaks trapped inside a cave. (I say 'freaks' not disparagingly, but because they resemble a carnival sideshow more than anything else) I read another comment that said the second half was a 'New Testament allegory.' I don't see that at all. What I see is an allegory between Mexico and the US, Mexico being those trapped in the cave and the US being the fat, over-dressed citizens of the town decorated with eye-within-the-pyramid banners. This new El Topo and his beloved are forced to beg and clown for a living, and clean toilets, and wash windows. When they finally do break through the wall to the cave and the 'freaks' venture forth into the town, they are all shot and killed. Maybe this appears to be an allegory for how the US treats Mexican immigrants when seen today, given the ironic difficulties so many Americans have with immigrants. Even so, it made a very strong impression on me. All in all, I think Santa Sangre is a much more full, rich, imaginative and cohesive film. It is interesting to see many of the same themes from El Topo in Santa Sangre: right of passage into manhood, armless people using another's arms as his own, physically and mentally challenged people, magic tricks, circus music and, of course, a lot of bloodshed. I wish this filmmaker would make more movies."
106,El Topo,8,25 June 2006,"Strange, Trippy , And Violent Mexican Western...","As pretty much everyone else has already said - EL TOPO is a strange film filled with symbolism and ""meaning"" - some of which I grasped, some of which was lost in the confusing narrative and editing. A great film to ""look at""...uniquely ""stylish"" and interesting, especially for a Western..El Topo (The Mole) roams the land with his nekkid 7 year-old son in tow, shooting most everyone that crosses his path. He starts of by dispatching a gang of thieves, moves on to killing a ruthless and sleazy General (where afterwards he drops his son off to be raised by some monks), and then into the desert to find and kill four master gunmen. After that, the whole film gets real confusing to me, as it moves in a totally different direction revolving around a community of inbred cripples who are trapped living in a cave, and some guy (also El Topo?) who vows to free them from their ""prison""...Honestly, I didn't really know what the hell was going on with this film 90% of the time, but it really didn't matter. There's always something happening to keep your interest. A decent amount of nudity and a high quotient of bloody violence definitely help. The character of El Topo himself is pretty interesting as a sort of ""anti-hero"" who will resort to any means necessary to win his gunfights. I will say that the second portion of the film, though equally strange - felt disjointed and was not as enjoyable to me. Regardless, I recommend this film to those that enjoy strange/surreal films, Westerns, or just want something ""different"" for a change...8/10"
107,El Topo,,14 June 2006,Interesting? very much.... Entertaining? i dunnoooo,"i did a year at the art academy of Amsterdam (oooOOOOooo) and was lucky enough to see this movie as a part of a cinema club which was organized by some of the students. i have to say, what the hell?!! this movie is one of the most surreal I've ever seen. one part spaghetti western, one part shady erotic art flick, one part freak show, with heavy similarities to martial arts movies (wandering warrior, looking to defeat grandmasters, etc). i have to say that at the end of it all i was glad i had seen the movie, but will i see it again? I'm not so sure about it. while the movie was filled with enough things which could be seen as symbolism and enough randomness to be classified as 'deep', a lot of it was dubious. i read an interview with the director and apparently he REALLY did have sex with all those women on screen. after hearing this he starts to seem more and more reminiscent of some scuzzy artist who likes to paint women naked, and convinces them to sleep with him for, 'ahem' ""artistic reasons"". On the other hand the movie did have some interesting connotations, such as the underground freakshow, the shiver inducing crazy townsfolk and such. like the message title says. interesting-> hell yes, but entertaining? yes, but only because of its randomness and vulgarity. i can see why to some it might be a masterpiece, and they wouldn't be wrong. This brings to mind what Johnny deps character said in ""fear and loathing"", and i think it works perfect for this movie--> "" Too weird to live, and too rare to die"""
108,El Topo,,13 February 2004,It is a crime against movie lovers that El Topo is not available.,"In the seventies, I watched this film dozens of times.  I have a book which contains its script and stills from the production.  I was fascinated by the director's visual approach to the masters consulted on the road to the protagonist's development.El Topo was like an onion which you peeled away at, each layer richer than the previous in metaphor, mysticism, and the zen of movie making.  Yet every attempt to find a clean copy is frustrated by those who own the rights, but do not want to share it.  I have been offered pirated copies sub-titled in Japanese, but, for obvious reasons, not accepted.Get it back on the market (in dvd)."
109,El Topo,,22 September 1999,"very spiritual, shocking, unforgettable","I first saw this at one of its first midnight showings in the early 70s and was absolutely blown away. I was not on acid but watching it surely seemed like a trip. The music was particularly captivating, so much so that I rushed out and bought the soundtrack album which I still cherish. Very disturbing imagery be forewarned, and you cannot remain ambivalent about the film. Either you like a lot or hate it a lot. But any student of comparative religion/divinity/spirituality needs to see this work. It packs a punch. I am now on a quest to purchase a video copy and I think I may have found a retailer in France which carries it. I will let you know if it comes in."
110,El Topo,,23 March 2002,Robert John is the best!,"Actually the only reason robert john is the best is because he is my father. He played el topo's older son, the monk. The director met my dad on the street in montreal, and asked him to be in the movie because he felt they looked similar. My dad agreed and was off to mexico. He almost didn't agree to be in it, because he wasn't told how weird it would be. But jorodowsky convinced him. He said there wasn't many drugs on the set which i found surprising. He told me that John Lennon agreed to finance jorodowskys next films but it never materialized. If you want a copy of the movie, ebay usually has them. I am quite ticked as dad threw out that rude leather cowboy suit thing. It would be a killer costume.Luke John Skipper (It was cool in the 70's to use your middle name as your last. Or at least thats what pop tells me)"
111,El Topo,,27 May 2001,"Epic, Cathartic, Brutal, Landmark.","The reader comments here thus far have said it all, almost.I saw ""El Topo"" at the Elgin theater, (border of east Village and Chelsea) in 1971 3 or four times.  It remains the most profound movie I have experienced.  I would like to own it if I can find it.Having practiced meditation, read most all of Herrmann Hesse and ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", I may have been especially poised to receive it's cathartic message.I was puzzled by the seeming senselessness it contained, Two woman with me left after the first half hour.  I did persuade them to return for the end and they ultimately acknowledged the value of the movie.  Initially I thought the graphic brutality was misplaced, but after seeing a similar technique in movies such as ""Catch 22"" and ""Easy Rider"" I realized the senselessness was necessary to break down my sensibilities so that I could experience with virgin eyes concepts foreign to my former world model.  I realized this and laughed out loud in a quiet theater after the ""breakdown"" in ""Catch 22"" culminated with a buggy driver beating a dead horse (again).Given the level of violence and brutality today's movie viewers have been hardened by, I am not sure it can ever have the same effect.Although the technique has been applied effectively in conquering old views of everything from war to individualism, only ""El Topo"" fully succeeded in stripping me naked before creation challanging our very nature of self, exposing our competitiveness and need for control and making us accountable for the dark side of the triumph of individual over social power in ourselves.I sure would like it on DVD, or anyway I can get it.  I do wonder if I'll feel the same seeing it again after 30 some years."
112,El Topo,,20 April 2001,The greatest western ever made...,"This is one of the all time greatest westerns ever made. It had the true artistic vision that this genre of film should have. Strange plot to this movie, the ""mole"" clad in leather is on the spirtual journey to end all journeys. This movie was indirectly a precursor to Holy Mountain also by Jordorsky. If you are looking for this great film contact me..."
113,El Topo,,9 June 2000,Unforgettable western with old testament references,"This is Jodorowsky´s strongest work in the sense that it has sequences that are simply unforgettable. I have never met more people whose outlook was changed from the viewing of this film alone. I love the opening scene between him and his son, the creaking of the hung men in the massacred village, and the whip fight between his two female disciples.  The blood letting is wonderfully organic and sensual. The piece can be a little long but definetely worth seeing. I also recommend his other pieces (Holy Mountain, Sante Sangre, and Fando & Lis). Stay away from Rainbow Thief. Also read the Incal comic series that Jodorowsky drafted with Moebius. I also recommend viewing High Plains Drifter for it´s biblical references, whip scene, and brutal interaction. It is a step down from El Topo in insanity and much more narrative but also very striking in landscape and tone. Both are two of my favorite westerns and films of all time."
114,El Topo,,24 February 2000,hard to describe....,"I had a very draining experience after watching this flick, thinking to myself,   just plain and simple,  ""woah""But I do have a love for these flicks because you can make out your own meaning of what is going on. EL TOPO certainly gives you this opportunity.I was reading the comments here and noticed all the religions mentioned that may play a part in this film. Buddhism, Zen, etc... One that i thought was left out is the Keltic beliefs of the Druids who were into reincarnation. If this is so, then it would fit in perfectly in EL TOPO. After he is wounded/killed by the betraying women, he is back to life several years later and becomes a different man, He looks different and certainly acts different  (I doubt that the gunslinger would have fell in love with the dwarf woman).I was still trying to decipher the "" GENESIS"" and ""PSALMS"" sections of the movie though the ""APOCALYPSE"" segment is pretty understandable, its ending climax is one of the most compelling scenes i've ever witnessed in cinema!Though many say that you have to see this movie more than once to get an idea of what EL TOPO is, once was enough for me, but i may give it a second viewing some other time...When I'm a different person :-)"
