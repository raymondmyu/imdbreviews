0,Rio 2,4,4 May 2014,A good animation is made weak by clichéd writing.,"A good animation is made weak by clichéd writing.Lot of work and thought and detailing goes into an animated film. But if the writing is weak it cannot be pulled off easily. RIO 2 precisely suffers from that. The scenes are too clichéd for my comfort and the plot is very age-old. The bird formations, their beautiful feats have been all been seen in RIO and there is nothing new to offer on that front too in RIO 2. I felt like the basic format of the earlier film RIO was taken and just few modifications were done in writing. So it has that been there, seen that feel that does not add up any value.The voice over is good and it seems like Jesse Eisenberg did make effort to feel like the bird Blu. Although the chemistry between the two birds, Blu and Jewel does not show up adequately, individually voice over of each was good. It's Anne Hathway for the female protagonist, Jewel.The other aspects were fine, considering this is a commercial animated film. A word about music, which was good in RIO, comes weak and though are many songs, not even one was memorable, as I left the theater. So the music did not make any impression either. If people like average stuff or have not seen RIO, perhaps will like it as they may find some new things here. For me, I did not like it and felt like a big bore. An average rating of 2/5 for this. It's not bad, it's purely mediocre."
1,Rio 2,2,7 September 2016,Rio 2,"Rio 2(2014) Starring:Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Leslie Mann, Jamie Foxx, Andy Garcia, Bruno Mars, Jemaine Clement, Rodrigo Santoro, Jake T. Austin, Amandla Stenberg, Pierce Gagnon, Rita Moreno, Kristin Chenoweth, Tracy Morgan, Will.i.am, and George Lopez Directed By:Carlos Saldanha Review HE'S VILLAINOUS, SHE'S VENOMOUS. You know I actually liked the first Rio movie a lot actually and I didn't even want to see it but my sister made me anyway and I actually thought it was great. When I heard the sequel and saw the trailer a billion times on comcast to rent or own, I knew this would be some generic family animated sequel I wouldn't enjoy and guess what I was right. The Film revolves around Blu, Jewel and their three kids after they're hurtled from Rio de Janeiro to the wilds of the Amazon. As Blu tries to fit in, he goes beak-to-beak with the vengeful Nigel, and meets the most fearsome adversary of all: his father-in-law. The story isn't that interesting, it's basically a generic animated family feature where the main character doesn't want to leave his home because he's so use to things and when he does leave and gets to the Amazon the father of his wife doesn't like him, and there is a much more attractive character that his wife is spending more time with which makes him jealous. It's been done too death and I don't like it. The movie does not achieve it's goal, thanks to its generic story the movie is bland and boring, even if I do like the performances from the actors it's just not that well interesting for me to care about what's going on in the picture. All the elements of a good film are not present it's just bland, generic,boring, and tiresome. With good performances that help not making a stupid waste time. I give Rio 2 a two out of five."
2,Rio 2,8,29 March 2014,Entertaining,"While it wasn't the best movie or even the best animation I have seen this year, this movie is definitely entertaining.The movie begins with Blu, Jewel and their three kids having fun in their home in Rio, while Blu's former owner, Linda, and her husband, Tulio, are in the amazon. While in the Amazon, they discover a flock of blue macaws. Seeing this on the news, Jewel is desperate to visit and the story begins as Blu, his family and his friends from the last movie accompany him to the Amazon.The story is decent. There are quite a few songs and plenty of comedic moments as well. While Blu is trying to fit in the tribe, there are a couple of dangerous foes around, Nigel and an illegal tree logger (one of which had plenty of moments which kind of reminded me of Avatar). There are plenty of great moments in the amazon when Blu is trying to fit in, which leads to one of my favourite moments, which was when they revealed the Pit of Doom. Also, it was fun to see Nigel (the white cockatoo) back, along with some new characters. The voice-work and music were quite good as well.This movie is entertaining, the story and ending are nice as well. Although I have rated it the same as Rio, I think this was a little better. Found it to be quite funny and more action packed as well. A fun family movie."
3,Rio 2,5,6 April 2014,Some high quality scenes make not a good movie.,"I am not the kind of person to write reviews on my own, but this one you will read is made not only by me, but also by my 7 year old daughter, who watched this movie with me.The movie started good. The 3D is good, the dancing animals and the introduction of Blue's family were creating big smiles on the face of my daughter. If the movie would have continued the same way we would rank it with 7 or 8 stars.After a while I noticed the movie lost its speed, its flavor and most of the charm. Without 3D it would have been worse but with it it was still okay for me.The reason why we rank it with only 5 stars is the following. After 60 min. my daughter started to become anxious. I asked her why she seems so nervous and she told me that she is bored. And in my surprise I noticed i am too and the kids around us. There was no laughter and no giggling. This should not happen in a movie with an average rating of 7 and my daughter and the other kids fitting into the target group.The end of the movie was okay and my daughter watched it again with attention. But that I had to ask my daughter, if she wants to leave during the movie, lets us stay with 5 out of 10 points.Watch it at home on DVD, but do not spend 20 (Germany) for an average movie.For comparison to RIO No1: The reason we went into this movie in the first place, was that we own the BlueRay of Rio. We watched it together several times and we were looking forward to watch the second part."
4,Rio 2,7,13 April 2014,Meet the Parents with birds,"Quickie Review:Like the title of this review says, Rio 2 is basically an animated version of Meet the Parents (2000). Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) with a family of three kids, venture into the Amazon to find a flock of their own kind. Blu faces his father-in-law for the first time and must now prove his worth to him and the flock. Hollywood is filled with movies that repeat a general formula or idea. Even with a predictable story, Rio 2 does enough to keep your attention with beautiful animation and some memorable characters. Kids especially will have a lot of fun, but the adults are not left behind.Full Review:Rio 2 starts with Blu and Jewel living in the Blue Macaw reserve with their three kids. Blu and the kids feel completely at home living side by side with the humans, while Jewel longs to live out in the wild with her family. They soon find out that they are not the last of their kind, and there might be a whole flock in the Amazon. This provides the perfect opportunity for the family to reconnect with their roots. Once they arrive and find the flock, Jewel is reunited with her long lost father Eduardo (Andy Garcia). Blu must now prove to Eduardo that he is worthy of his respect and blessing, while preventing Roberto (Bruno Mars) from reigniting an old flame with Jewel. In the meantime, Nigel (Jemaine Clement) along with his new obsessed companion frog Gabi (Kristin Chenoweth), seeks revenge following the events of the previous movie.The plot in itself is nothing special or unique. Here's a quick challenge for you: just by reading the synopsis, think what the beginning, the middle, the climax, and the end of this movie is going to be Done? Well then, I don't know exactly who you are but I'm 99% sure you got it right. So yes the movie is predictable, and does fall into the trap of the many father-in-law subplot clichés. Still the movie is charming enough to not put you to sleep. It is clear that the movie is mostly targeted for the kids but there is still some humor for us adults, or the parents, or the baby sitter to enjoy.Most of the cast have returned from the original, and they all play their parts well. However the stand outs for me has to be Nigel and newcomer Gabi. Every time they are on screen they put a smile on my face. Nigel is this over the top diva, who wants all the attention on himself because he truly believes he deserves it (well, I won't argue against it!). Gabi on the other hand is a poisonous frog that is deeply and helplessly in love with Nigel (think the popular ""overly obsessed girlfriend"" meme). She is also probably one of the cutest animated characters yet. These two play many of the scenes that the adults will enjoy as they dramatize popular songs and hilariously re-enact Shakespearean scenes from Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet.In essence this movie serves the purpose of being entertaining. Rio 2 is a beautifully made animated movie with a satisfactory plot. There is nothing wrong with Rio 2, but there's not much great about it either. Kids will love this movie, and adults will not feel like they wasted their time."
5,Rio 2,7,19 April 2014,An enjoyable sequel,"As someone who loved the first film, while the advertising was not the best it didn't put me off seeing Rio 2. And it was very enjoyable, not as good as the original but it is an example of animated sequels that do work. The story and the pacing are uneven here, with the film getting off to a slightly slow start and feeling rushed in other places, though you do have to admire the energy there is. There are plenty of fun parts with the second half far more compelling than the first and the film rarely has a dull moment, but structurally it is on the thin side and content-wise it feels overstuffed. However, if you want lots of colour, catchy music, fun and good characters and voice acting, Rio 2 very like its predecessor doesn't disappoint. The animation is amazing with lots of vibrant detail especially in the backgrounds and nothing looks hurried or static. The colours are even more brighter and colourful than the first film too. The music has that Brazilian flavour and the songs are incredibly catchy. Don't Go Away is a very touching song, but the highlights are the pizazz-personified Poisonous Love and the hilarious rap version of I Will Survive(thought I'd never say this, can't stand rap on the most part). While the film does feel overstuffed, the content is actually really good, dialogue-wise it's smartly written and has a fair amount of heart while the gags provide plenty of laughs with sharp timing, the best being the soccer match, the jungle auditions and any scene(the Romeo and Juliet part in particular) with Gabi and Nigel. The characters are still engaging, Blu and Jewel are likable lead characters though they had more to do in the first one and Nigel has that menacing streak but is a riot. There are some great new characters as well, with Gabi as good a character as and in some cases even better the original ones. The voice acting adds to that, Jemaine Clement and Kristen Chenoweth are both phenomenal helped by that they have the film's best moments, though Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Andy Garcia and everybody else acquit themselves more than fine too. To conclude, a good sequel to a great original, enjoyed it a lot and when it comes to animated sequels there is definitely much worse(ie. Secret of NIMH 2). 7/10 Bethany Cox"
6,Rio 2,8,6 July 2014,"Good family film, and worthy follow up to the original. Just be sure you watch with the right expectations.","Story: The story here suffers from too many subplots, and a lack of focus. It also doesn't help that all the subplots here are generic. This would would kill a film......if it was made by someone like Pixar or Studio Ghibli. But since this film's plot isn't the main focus, or why audiences watched the 1st Rio, then the bad story doesn't really hurt this film as much as it could've been. But it's still a bad story nonetheless. 4/10Animation: It's beautiful, gorgeous, colorful, and worth watching on Blu-ray or Blu-ray 3D. 10/10Characters And Comedy: All characters here follow standard archetypes we all know of, but Nigel and Gabi serve as the most original and most entertaining. Comedy is solid with some funny moments in the film. 6/10Sound: Good score and amazing soundtrack. Love the songs here more than Frozen, but none really hit the heights of Hot Wings from the 1st. Although some of the songs do come close. 9/10Acting And Casting: All actors/actresses do a good job voicing their roles, especially with Jesse E. as the voice of Blu. I'm also surprised Bruno Mars didn't suck. 7/10Verdict: Don't watch this film for the story. Watch it like you would a Madagascar film and just sit back, relax, and enjoy an entertaining family film with some beautiful animation, good comedy, and amazing songs.Extra: +1 for being a sequel I enjoyed.Rating: 8/10For a more in-depth review (stupid 1000 word limit), check out my Metacritic review: http://www.metacritic.com/user/DemonicSoul?myscore- filter=Movie"
7,Rio 2,3,21 November 2015,Ticking the spoiler box is overrated,"One star for my daughter enjoying it. One star because I laughed at something. One star because I didn't fall asleep.I only ticked the spoiler box so I wouldn't be blacklisted, but really if you can't watch this movie an predict everything that will happen from start to finish, it must be the first movies you've ever watched.Allow me to list the clichés...Happy family fly away from the city and into the wild. Happens upon secret blue macaw sanctuary. Jewel reunited with long lost family. Jewel's father is leader of utopian society. Jewel's dad hates Blu. Far superior male bird is friends with jewel, named Roberto. Blu feels threatened. Roberto is superior in looks, physicality and singing. Jewel's dad take Blu through a grueling wilderness training regime and is disappointed.Yeah I'm sick of that now. But upon the more ridiculous and unnecessary is a talent audition scheme, held by Rico and Pedro. A sporting match which decides territory ownership. The simple fact that none of this sequels plot or story was relevant to any aspect of the original film.There was absolutely no reason for this movie to be made. Well except one; a capital letter S with a vertical line through it. At least Shrek 4 avoided as many clichés as it could, but Dreamworks have gone the way of Disney with Rio 2 by treating a movie like a business."
8,Rio 2,7,10 April 2014,"Even if Rio 2 seems preachy, it is still a gorgeously rendered animation that celebrates song and dance through a kaleidoscopic burst of colors.","As a sequel to the 2011 original, Rio 2 continues in the tradition of its older sibling with screwball humor and madcap mischief. While maintaining a pedigree for celebrating song and dance through a kaleidoscopic burst of colors, Rio 2 is gorgeously rendered but offset by a clichéd script that is also laced with classroom lecture.This sequel begins in Rio de Janeiro where our feathered friends Blu and Jewel (Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway) discover that they are not the last of their species after all. Along with their three kids, they leave Rio and fly to the Amazonian rain forest where an entire flock of blue macaws was reportedly spotted. As it turns out, the flock exists and is headed by Jewel's long lost father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) and guarded by her old flame Roberto (Bruno Mars). Now reduced to a stuttering parrot, Blu must man-up to his overzealous father-in-law (think Robert De Niro in Meet the Parents) while thwarting Roberto's attempts (think Owen Wilson in Meet the Parents) at charming Jewel. Meanwhile, Blu's nemesis Nigel (Jemaine Clement) has resurfaced and is all out for revenge.Come school days and kids will have plenty of reason to mimic their favorite characters. From human characters voiced by Rodrigo Santoro and Leslie Mann, to Blu's crooning friends Nico (Jamie Foxx), Pedro (Will.i.am), everyone is back for a second round of slapstick shenanigans. And joining the old cast are some feisty new voice talents including Kristin Chenoweth as Gabi, a poisonous dart-frog so obsessed with Nigel, you could even think of her as his psycho girlfriend. Haunted by a disastrous turn of events in the first movie, Nigel himself is loonier than before with a thespian swagger that pokes fun at none other than the Bard of Avon. Speaking of which, lookout for a hilarious scene aimed at adults where Nigel and Gabi find themselves dramatizing one of Shakespeare's greatest plays. While many such segments are genuinely funny, the story strays at times with subplots from deforestation to male bonding, before stepping into a puddle of teary-eyed melodrama. Kids laughed and adults clapped, but there were periods of silence too, and I am not referring to those brief scenes where death was implied.Emerging as a game changer in animated films, Blue Sky Studios, a subsidiary of 20th Century Fox, struck gold with its very first feature production  Ice Age (2002). It's been tunneling through a gold mine ever since. While Rio 2 might seem like a cash cow for some viewers, it is still a delightful animation with foot-tapping music to get your groove on. And like a Gloria Gaynor hit song performed by Clement's Nigel, there is every reason to believe this sequel will survive."
9,Rio 2,2,19 April 2014,Not a Good Message,"The film starts off as usual for an animated movie these days -- the businessman is the bad guy. In this case, it is a logger who refers to the Blue's humans as ""tree huggers."" The good guys are trying to find evidence of an endangered species in the rain forest so that they can shut down logging operations. It seems fairly typical child environmental propaganda at first. Then it turns dark. It starts by desensitizing the kids to violence by showing some animals eaten by other animals during a song and dance sequence. The movie climaxes with a violent attack on the logging operation at the end of which the bad businessman is actually killed. I am not kidding. This movie seems to advocate violent environmental activism. It makes the movie much less entertaining -- for adults and kids."
10,Rio 2,8,10 April 2014,"Joyous, silly and affecting, this is a very welcome return to Rio.","Sequels are tricky propositions - it's hard to find creative freedom and joy in an enterprise clearly geared towards bringing in ever more heaps of cash. For every glorious Toy Story sequel, there's Cars 2 or yet another lacklustre installment in the Ice Age franchise. Fortunately for Blue Sky Studios, Rio 2 is frequently excellent, a sunny, cheerful reprise of a hit movie that finds its own grace notes.Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg), everyone's favourite domesticated macaw, is happily married to Jewel (Anne Hathaway) after their adventures in the first film. Worried that their three beautiful children are becoming too city-bound, Jewel entreats Blu to take the family to the Amazon to connect with their roots. Once in the jungle, Jewel discovers that she and Blu aren't the only surviving adult blue macaws in the world after all: she reconnects with her family, including her dad Eduardo (Andy Garcia) and childhood friend Roberto (Bruno Mars). Suddenly, Blu is the odd one out, and must desperately try to fit into a wild, raucous world that seems to have no place for him and his civilised ways.There's almost too much happening in Rio 2: apart from Blu's family troubles, the macaw tribe's haven in the jungle is under threat from a ruthless logging company. Fan favourite Nigel (Jemaine Clement) - the most puffed-up, actorly, diabolical cockatoo you'll ever meet - returns to take revenge upon his nemesis, Blu, with poisonous tree frog Gabi (Kristin Chenoweth) in tow. As per the first film, Rio 2 also packs its soundtrack with joyful, high-energy numbers - which is explained away by Nico (Jamie Foxx) and Pedro (will.i.am) auditioning jungle denizens for a spot in the upcoming Rio Carnival.What's so impressive about this film is how it manages to make all the disparate elements of its overstuffed plot work. Powered by a loopy, irrepressible charm, Rio 2 dashes from scene to scene, but doesn't forget to pack in moments that range from affecting (Jewel's tender lullaby Don't Go Away) to absurd (Blu's GPS charting the route to Funky Town). The characters in any given sequel are usually the first to get lost in the shuffle, but they each get moments to shine here. Blu's connection with his human companion Linda (Leslie Mann) isn't the focus of this film, but nevertheless makes itself felt in the final act. The relationship between Blu and Jewel is also beautifully heartfelt, dealing with ideas of compromise and growth after the honeymoon is long over.There's even room for a new breakout character. The shock of delight provided by Nigel in the first film - so gleefully subversive a villain - is largely eroded here, and he comes off more as a determined buffoon than anything else. But he's ably matched by the amorous Gabi, whose hopeless adoration of Nigel is channelled into two of the film's highlights: Poisonous Love, an overblown ballad with several hints of The Phantom Of The Opera; and a wacky, wonderfully rearranged rendition of Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive.Unwieldy though its plot may be, Rio 2 breezes through it all with cheeky energy and eye-wateringly glorious animation. But what makes Rio 2 as good as - if not better than - its predecessor is director Carlos Saldanha's understanding that losing sight of his characters will only damage the film. And so, amidst the tumult of mid-air football games and swooping aerial dance formations, Saldanha roots everything in the big, loving hearts of Blu and his extended family. The film - and the franchise - are all the better for it."
11,Rio 2,6,30 August 2014,The birds strike again! 6/10,"Review: I did prefer the original Rio because of the catchy tunes, but that's not to say that this is a bad movie. The storyline was quite good and the animation looked brilliant. The vibrant colours and the attention to detail was spot on but the jokes weren't as funny as the original. I liked some scenes like the auditions and some of the songs and the new characters were a great addition to the cast. The main problem that I found with the film was that it seemed like there was a lot going on at once. You've got the humans taking down the forest and the main character, Blue, trying to convince his wife that there old life was better than life in the Amazon. Then you've got a human couple who are trying to explore the Amazon and get caught up with thugs who don't want there operation interrupted. Anyway, when you put all of these elements together, it does make a good movie that must have taken a lot of work from the creators, but for some unknown reason, the simpler original was more enjoyable. Round-Up: This movie really does have some top names used as the voices of the characters. From Jesse Eissenberg, who seems to be in form at the moment, to Anne Hathaway and Andy Garcia who voices Eduardo, all the characters really do work together. Even Jamie Foxx, Bruno Mars, Tracy Morgan and Will.I.Am bring some urban flavour to the movie which really works as the comedy element. Anyway, on a whole, it's a great watch for the kids and there is some jokes for the adults which makes it fun for the whole family. Judging by the box office takings, I'm sure that were going to see a 3rd instalment of the birds on there adventures.Budget: $103million Worldwide Gross: $496million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who were fans of the first Rio and who are into there animation movies about birds saving the Amazon. 6/10"
12,Rio 2,10,23 April 2014,Inherently funny,"As someone who hasn't watched Rio 1, Rio 2 was not confusing so I was able to understand what is happening in just the first few minutes. This movie features really amazing animation, check out the opening carnival and the bird dance. Secondly, with stellar casts, this is like a Disney musical except it's funnier. Kristin Chenoweth is over the top as a lovelorn stalker. Seems like a role she always plays. Expect lots of Shakespeare soliloquies parodying the classic Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and many more. Thirdly, the amazon rainforest setting really enables us to be introduced to many new characters. From rapping sloths (Ke$ha anyone?) to taichi fighting old ninja turtles, Rio 2 does not rely on low-brow dirty jokes unlike some other movie I could mention (Madagascar? It also is named after a place). This movie is funny, exciting, and slightly touching, the perfect thing to watch with friends, family and partners alike."
13,Rio 2,8,5 September 2014,A very good sequel,"I loved the original Rio film and I found Rio 2 to be a very enjoyable sequel. What really makes these movies great is the outstanding attention to detail. The colours are extremely bright and vibrant which make the adventure all the more enjoyable. The scenery is beautiful too and brings a realistic feeling. Its great that all the original characters remained (from what I can remember anyway) and then there was some new additions too. The red frog was particularly amusing and it was great to see more of ""the kids"". All the characters were voiced exceptionally well which meant the jokes were executed perfectly to provide the laughs. There was actually quite a few laugh out loud moments and in general it's a film that made me smile all the way through. The storyline to this sequel was interesting and the film flowed at a nice pace. There were some great scenes but my particular favourite was the football match! Overall I really enjoyed this sequel. I think Rio is a very underrated animated movie franchise,I personally hope there's going to be a Rio 3. 8/10"
14,Rio 2,1,4 August 2014,The Most Overrated Movie of All Time!,"OVERRATED?? You might be thinking, ""How is this overrated? Nobody was hyping over it, it just flew over everyone's heads...""It's overrated in the fact that some people liked it. It was extremely bad, and some people liked it. That makes it EXTREMELY overrated. Yes, this movie was so bad that the fact that, let's say, ONE person decided to even call it entertaining makes it overrated. This movie really was THAT BAD!This movie combines amazingly cringe worthy and lame humour, mind- blowingly stupid plot elements and dialogue, boredom and beautiful animation to make a ""film"" that looks beautiful but is pretty much content-free.A seriously big problem with this film was the attitude of the children, and the fact that one of them actually has an iPod. THEY'RE GODDAMN BIRDS. I remember the first Rio, which portrayed them as BIRDS, encountering problems related to flying and their size. In this dumb film, Blu and his family actually spend time in a humans' home, eating pancakes, using the toaster, and, uh, using iPods. One of Blu's kids (the one with the damned iPod) has a snobby teenager's attitude that really is so painful to watch and frickin' NOT FUNNY you feel driven to take your own life. Are you getting an image of how bad this is now? What if I told you this part with them eating pancakes in a house was at the beginning, and only lasted 5 minutes? Yep, it gets worse...Clichéd writing as well makes this movie nonetheless painful and stupid to watch. It is fully predictable, no exciting/suspenseful plot, and the horrible attempt to add a problem or dilemma at the beginning, where Blu and Jewel were discussing going to the deeper depths of the jungle to reunite with their kind, talking about how ""they don't want to go"" but at the same time, they do! We've seen it about a million times in kids movies of the current generation. Really, this was bad. Save your money."
15,Rio 2,3,17 October 2016,Bad messages hidden behind good ones,"The central message of family over tech is good and all, but if you look at the way its brought together, it makes you question the movie's moral code.Look at the events. first, the movie seems simple, a family trip to visit the mother's relatives, however as the movie goes on it becomes clear that the mother never really intended for this to just be a trip. She clearly wants to stay and raise her children inside her colony and though this isn't an outright bad idea, the sneaky way she goes about it makes be really question her character. As I watched I even started going back to the first movie and realized that given the sequence of events, she could be rethinking her entire marriage.Not only that but throughout the movie Blue himself really is picked on for a lot of things that simply weren't his fault and is subsequently treated as if they were done deliberately. From the berries to the sports game and seeking approval from Jewel's father. Jewel should know what kind of husband she has and while I fully accept trying to help someone better themselves, It very much seems like she is literally trying to make him into something that is much more like her old boyfriend. Which affects Blue's self-esteem.Then there are the poachers who could have been left out to tell the truth. Nigel was already here and the poachers seem very after though. I mean when Blue encounters the poachers and just up and decides that he doesn't need humans anymore than I really don't understand anything. Was his blatant love for his owner and society really so fickle that meeting this one group of bad people could change that. Made even more stupid by the fact that he almost immediately does an 180 and goes back to loving humans again, making the first freak out even more confusing.There are a lot of horrible plot holes and clichés I can also complain about, but I'll just finish with simply stating that the original was great and didn't need a sequel, especially not thi one."
16,Rio 2,5,7 July 2014,"A Decent Film, But Nothing New","Rio 2 is one of those films for me where I don't expect too much. The first film was not the greatest, but still enjoyable nonetheless, and Rio 2 is much the same.Firstly I must point out the visuals are quite good, and the star-studded cast also lightens up the film. However, the habitat-loss theme is one that has been explored in other animated films, and comes across as a bit cliché. The birds view humans as bad people who threaten their habitat, and the message is too familiar and obvious. We've seen this before, even in films like Avatar, a more adult film, where humans are viewed as the antagonists.The villains in this film I think are a bit confusing: is it Nigel, the cockatoo, or the man who cuts down trees illegally for money? I think the film tries to incorporate both in the film as major antagonists, but doesn't quite pull it off. Nigel seems more like a minor character, such as Scrat from the Ice Age series. He doesn't really fit into the category as villain for me. Plus, the illegal villain is not new; the first Rio film also had this.Rio 2 is a fine entry into the animated films genre. The visual effects and the voice cast are great, but the plot and message we have seen before. So far this film has been doing quite well in the box-office, and so it should: Rio 2 is nothing spectacular, but still a decent film."
17,Rio 2,7,12 April 2014,Beautiful Animation Yet Again Weak script....overall a good time pass flick (especially in 3D),"I have no expectations when walking into theater to watch this flick.I saw original it has a different,colorful animation and some funny moments but it is not a great flick so i just expected some fun and good colorful animation.and this film served me just what i thought.colorful birds and backgrounds,excellent dances,cool music.but if you go deep there is nothing great about plot.routine and predictable.however voice acting once again saved us.and there are some fun moments which will provide some laughs. 3D-i really loved this film in 3D. beaks come out of the screen,birds dancing in front of you,especially climax has some great 3D effects.finally if you have no expectations and if you can neglect plot you can enjoy the film with your kids."
18,Rio 2,1,19 April 2014,Too toxic for children,"Well made but it is unbelievable how toxic the message is.Basically the whole movie from the very beginning is portraying the males as irresponsible dumb idiotic losers and the females as intelligent confident and independent leaders. What a disgrace. The continuous humiliation of the male character is shocking when you think that male actors actually accepted to lend their voices and play those roles. Avoid watching it especially with your kids around. And if you do decide to watch it simply try and swap in your head the two genders with different races, let's say swap male characters with blacks and the female characters with whites and see if you would find it worth watching."
19,Rio 2,8,15 April 2014,"A vibrant, energetic, hilarious & colorful film that surpasses it's predecessor.","Rio 2 continues with the adventures of blue macaws, Blu(Jesse Eisenberg), Jewel(Anne Hathaway) & their friends, Rafael(George Lopez), Nico(Jamie Foxx), Pedro(Will.i.am) & the drooling dog, Luiz(Tracy Morgan). Following the events of the first movie, Blu, Jewel & their three kids, Carla(Rachel Crow), Tiago(Pierce Gagnon) & Bia(Amandla Stenberg) are living a life of domesticated bliss in Rio. Feeling that the family has become too domesticated, Jewel, decides to move to the Amazon jungle. Bored with their lives in Rio, Rafael, Nico & Pedro decide to accompany the family to the Amazon. Linda(Leslie Mann) & Tulio(Rodrigo Santoro) happen to be honeymooning in the Amazon, as well. This, & a lot of surprises as well as dangers are in store for Blu & co. once they begin their Amazon adventure. Meanwhile, Nigel(Jemaine Clement), the deranged cockatoo, wants revenge. Rio 2 is far better than Rio. The colors are brighter, the animation is more stunning, the 3D is better, the jokes are funnier, the emotions are stronger & the overall message of the film is meaningful without being too preachy. The Amazon looks extremely beautiful & realistic. It rarely looks like animation. The viewer relates to Blu the most, as he's almost like a human. Blu's awkwardness & nervousness about moving to the Amazon & what lies ahead, makes us feel sad for him. The voice acting is top notch, which is no surprise, looking at the incredibly talented cast. Anne Hathaway is outstanding as Jewel. Hathaway conveys love, vulnerability & a wide range of emotions using her voice, with ease. She sings like an angel too. Jesse Eisenberg is hilarious & lovable as the awkward yet adorable, Blu. Eisenberg is perfect for the voice of Blu. Leslie Mann & Rodrigo Santoro are excellent as Linda & Tulio, respectively. Jemaine Clement is menacing, deranged & hilarious simultaneously, as antagonist, Nigel. George Lopez is great as Rafael. Jamie Foxx is amazing as Nico. Will.i.am is impressive as Pedro. Kristin Chenoweth is hysterical as the infatuated frog, Gabi. Andy Garcia is perfect as Eduardo. Bruno Mars is melodious as Roberto. Finally, Tracy Morgan is great in his cameo as Luiz. Rio 2 is fun for the whole family. A must watch!"
20,Rio 2,6,14 April 2014,OK but Rio was far better.,"As I said, Rio was much better, exciting and thrilling. After the 1st movie Blu and jewel have settled in Rio and have 3 kids. On TV they see blu's earlier owner and protector trying to find more macaw's in the Amazon. Jewel suggests that all of them should go to the Amazon forrest to help their human friends - Linda and her husband. They leave for Amazon and thrill beings. In the meanwhile the villein from the first movie - Nigel the cockatoo tries to take revenge for making him a bird which cannot fly. Along with that mission his friends join - the frog who is perpetually in love with Nigel and the ant eater who is interested in only eating ants and nothing else. Later his tongue is used for way too many interesting activities. Gabi, the frog, is the most funny of all. Her love for Nigel is out of this world and her dialogues, her song, her accent is way too funny. Bulldog is cute. Nigel's audition is incredible. Blu's induction program and training for getting accustomed to jungle life is funny too. Over all the movie has the expected share of charm, colors, songs, dance sequences, thrill and cuteness. But that's the problem, these things were expected and hence the movie was at par. Nothing extraordinary or above average. I would say, you wait for it to appear on TV and then watch it. Rio series is made my the same folks as Ice Age. Rio 2 may not be big hit. I liked it as a one time watch. It's in 3D, just fyi."
21,Rio 2,7,30 April 2014,Better than the first film,"I'm not a huge fan of the first ""Rio,"" as I think it is a very straight forward movie with little to offer. It's fun and all, but lacking in emotional punches. ""Rio 2"" on the other hand is a far stronger movie than the original. It's cast is superior and well balanced, the story has a few nicely done emotional sequences, and the animation is gorgeous. While I find the songs weaker than the highs of the first film, they are more consistent in terms of quality. The real highlight of the film is its script, which I think is Blue Sky's first or second best script to date. It is well balanced with a fish out of water story, a well handled environmental message that isn't being shoved down our throats, and well rounded humor. Overall, it's a fun experience with gorgeous animation. The first third of the film is a bit conventional and rather boring, but the second they get into the Amazon, the film really takes flight and gets better as it progresses. 3.5/5"
22,Rio 2,4,26 April 2014,"Self-indulgent, over-the-top garbage.","Are we now at the point where we can be bored stiff by $50 million of cutting-edge movie technology?Stereotyped characters, poor casting and an apoplectically lame story line. And stupid, sophomoric visual gags that are, more often than not, so fleeting that you wonder how many months of work and how much money were spent on each of them.Who on earth is green-lighting these garbage stories?If you can't first produce a decent script, don't waste your time trying to wow me with your visuals. Even my 5-year-old was bored.Bring on the feather and a bucket; I've gorged myself on your junk movie and want to purge myself so you can fill me up again with your next undeserving boondoggle."
23,Rio 2,1,11 February 2015,This film gave my friend brain cancer,"And it was his BIRTHDAY, that's how bad this is. I'm serious, dudes. We left the cinema during the football-war scene, but the damage done to our party was irreversible. We literally vomited for 10 minutes after getting out and then we bought some crepes but vomited again - that's how terrible it was. SO MUCH SINGING, and talking and talking and singing, COME ON! Not entertaining at all, and then adults wonder why 8 year-olds go on watching R-rated movies - it's because those do not insult the viewer's intelligence and ability to follow at least a half-developed plot. Just because the target audience is young, the film does not need to assume that those watching will be brain-dead babies amused by just colors, clichéd songs and characters from the first movie."
24,Rio 2,6,9 April 2014,Series of Fun,"The best feat of these Rio movies is how it wholeheartedly shows the landscapes and culture of Brazil. The first twenty or thirty minutes explores the wondrously colorful version of each places. Well, the entire movie really is eye candy, which makes you wish that the whole thing is nothing more than a cinematic tour. People who will come in for the location won't be disappointed because that is exactly what the film is excellent at. Though it's not actually an in-depth exploration, but it's still an inviting ride.Which is probably why the storyline suddenly hits to telling various ecological messages: one is how we shouldn't take the beauty of the Amazon for granted, and the other is against the logging of the forest. These can form an engaging story, especially after introducing us the wonders of these places, but the plot has caught itself with too many subplots. I mean there is too much conflict to deal with. For example: we see the cockatoo Nigel seeking for revenge to Blu, meanwhile there's Linda and Tulio getting into trouble with the loggers, further on the Macaw flock is unable to accept Blu because of his humanly attitude, and there is even an audition for dancing and drama. There is so much going on, yet any of it hardly offered any momentum to the story. We can see what theme they're trying to say to the audience, but these random stuff being put together randomly makes it kind of complicated.We couldn't deny that the film overall is still fun. Yes, it has occasional laughs and the flying scenes bring a spectacular scale. There are dance/musical numbers that are well constructed even though most of them feels like they just came out of nowhere. The cast are still a delight. Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway continues to shine in their roles. Jemaine Clement remains to be the most impressive among, even if the character becomes less necessary than before. Strong additions like Andy Garcia and Kristin Chenoweth also benefits to the adventure by giving distinct personalities that haven't been stepped in the film's lively world.Rio 2 got some grand potential right there, the problem is it's mostly just jumping from one distraction to another. The second half is probably supposed to be a series of fun sequences, but it never grows as a compelling story, no matter how it keeps delivering important sentiments about family and the environment. It's difficult to fault anyone for this since they are at least trying to elevate the material, the film just needs to be straightforward and consistent, kind of like the first movie. On the other hand, it's visually beautiful. I guess the animation and the vocal performances are the good things that remain intact. Just be aware of the extravagance and we're good."
25,Rio 2,8,15 July 2014,Excellent Movie for all ages,"This is one of those movies, that with out a doubt is one of the best to go see and is an awesome cartoon. The animations and the voice actors all did a great job with the development. The music is great and so are the little humorous parts in the movie. To break it down into the best way possible, it is aimed at the younger crowd, but can be enjoyed by just about everyone that loves these kind of funny animated movies. The rating for this movie is 8/10 and deserves high recognition in the animation and also bringing the family together. This would also be one of the movies that I will buy and put it on the shelf for movies that will become classics for me in the animation area."
26,Rio 2,10,12 April 2014,A worthy successor,"After three years, the Rio franchise continues, with this wonderful sequel.Blu and Jewel, having fallen in love during the first movie, now have three adorably rambunctious children, Bia, Carla and Tiago. Each chick has their own unique personality traits, providing an amusing balance during their opening shenanigan.Of course, the real story kicks in after the discovery of more blue macaws in the jungle, prompting Jewel to have the family (Plus their friends Nico, Pedro and Rafael) go to the jungle to meet them, and for the kids to connect to their roots. Along the way, they're spotted by Nigel, the villain of the original, who follows, seeking revenge.Once they get to the jungle, Blu experiences the classic ""disapproving father-in-law"" scenario, and suffers jealousy over Jewel's childhood friend, Roberto, both of which provide some humor and pathos.Blu and Jewel have experienced a bit of character development since the last movie. Blu is a little more confident and outgoing this time around (especially around the kids) and Jewel is a touch sweeter, and more compassionate. Their love for each other is still going strong, as is made clear in their very first scene (and in Blu's jealousy over Roberto).Nigel gets a couple of sidekicks in the form of mute anteater Charlie, and the poisonous frog Gabi, who happens to be totally besotted with him. Nigel and Gabi have two of (in my opinion) the best songs in the film, and, though pushed to the sidelines somewhat during the course of the film, their scenes are some of the most memorable.As for the new characters, Eduardo plays the role of the stern father-in-law quite well (Due mostly to Andy Garcia's contribution), and Roberto is a feathered Fabio, charming and friendly, but with a secret that comes out near the end of the film. Jewel's sweet and amusingly dotty Aunt Mimi rounds out the winged characters, with such lines as ""I knew you were coming back. I saw it in the droppings.""There are quite a few plot points running through the movie, and it does feel a little crowded at times. But there are some genuinely funny and touching moments along the way, and with musical accompaniment equal to that of the original.It all builds to an action-packed climax, where Blu really steps up. The final scene is an audio/visual joy to behold, and a great way to end the film.While it's true Rio 2 isn't exactly flawless, in my opinion, the positives outweigh the negatives, making it a worthy follow-up to the original."
27,Rio 2,8,10 April 2014,An Impressive Follow-Up,"Ever since the release of director Carlos Saldanha's 'Rio' back in 2011, I always expected a sequel to pop-up at any time following its success. Admittedly, I was skeptical at first of what success can 'Rio' bring out, but after Saldanha gave a glimpse of what his hometown was like and then announcing a sequel slowly coming around, it seemed to have set itself up as the new franchise for the studio (succeeding Ice Age).Jumping ahead three years later, I honestly have no clue what several critics failed to see in this new movie. Sure, it's not quite greater than the original, yet I caught Rio 2 on its first night and when I did, I was once again immersed and dazzled into the joy, spirit, and culture that is Rio de Janeiro. It was great hearing stars Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, George Lopez, and other recognizable names reprise their roles as Blu, Jewel, and the rest of their bird and human friends for a new adventure into another part of Brazil none have seen before.The story begins about a year after where the first movie left off. Spix Macaws Blu and Jewel now have three kids of their own and seem content together as a family. However, upon hearing a news story announcing the possibility of others like them existing deep in the Amazon rain forest, Jewel decides to take a reluctant Blu and their kids out to find them by putting aside their human conveniences in Rio and try to re-adapt into the wild. Finding it difficult to blend in this leafy environment, Blu, his family, and friends face not just vengeful cockatoo Nigel, but a new threat lurking somewhere in the jungle.The film's visuals were really mesmerizing with the seemingly realistic, luscious vegetation of the Amazon (it tends to somewhat remind me of the greenery setting in Blue Sky's 2013 film 'epic'), several good laughs involving the engaging ""sky soccer"" sequence that's a nod to the World Cup, and one notable song titled ""Don't Go Away"" sung by Hathaway (in my opinion) gave a sense of warmth and sentimentality; presumably building off of her Award-winning success from 2012's musical 'Les Miserables.' Recruiting new voice actors like Andy Garcia, Kristin Chenoweth, Bruno Mars, and Amandla Stenberg (Hunger Games' Rue) sure delivered the quirks and interesting personalities of their own characters. Although I'll admit a few songs were corny and unnecessary - namely Nigel's oddball rendition of 70s disco hit ""I Will Survive""  and that several gags do cause lagging in the main story, not to mention lacking a little more family chemistry between Blu and Jewel and their three kids, I will say that the return of Brazilian music guru Sergio Mendes brought out new, vibrant samba/bossa nova flair that can be both lively and sentimental at the same time along with a set of new music artists (both American and Brazilian) contributing to the appealing soundtrack. It's more than just a movie that entertains young kids and maybe even their parents with catchy songs or humorous moments, it provides a moral lesson on the importance of family and an awareness of how wildlife thrives in their natural habitat, which shouldn't be mistreated. I recommend this to those willing to take a break from the animated spectacle hits that are 'Frozen' and 'Lego,' and wanting to engage in something visually, musically, and culturally different."
28,Rio 2,7,15 April 2014,"Entertaining, Fun and Vibrant!","""Rio 2"" takes Blu and Jewel, now parents of three young ones, from the city comforts of Rio de Janeiro, deep into the tropical rain forests of the Amazon River. There, Jewel gets reunited with her kin and old friends, and the kids all get excited with their new jungle experience. However, purely city-bred Blu, ever dependent on his fanny pack and trusty GPS, had the most difficulty fitting in.Jesse Eisenberg totally transforms himself here as the voice of Blu. It can be argued that this actor seems to be the playing the same person in all of his movies. But here, he did not sound like his usual Jesse we see on screen. I was very surprised to see his name behind Blu. Anne Hathaway voiced Blu's wife Jewel. Her character was rather standard, not too much of a departure from what she does. More distinctive voice work were that of Andy Garcia as Jewel's father, the formidably regal Eduardo, and that of Bruno Mars as the suave lover-boy macaw Roberto. There was also a more minor auntie macaw character played by Ms. Rita Moreno.One subplot involved illegal loggers intent on clearing the rain forest of precious lumber. Blu's human friends Linda and Tulio try to stop them, but were obviously outnumbered. This angle provided the film with its serious moments of environmental concern. The scene showing the raped forest as a bare, cleared-out brown wasteland was tear-jerker. Of course, this has been a common theme in several films set in the wilderness, like ""Avatar"" or the latest animated incarnation of ""Tarzan"".The other subplot was a vengeful cockatoo named Nigel who has lost his ability to fly from an accident in the first ""Rio"" film because of Blu. His henchmen included a foolish anteater named Charlie and an infatuated pink poisonous frog named Gabi. Nigel and Gabi, despite being the antagonists, provide the film with two of the more memorable song numbers. Gabi (voiced by the incomparable Kristen Chenowith) shone with a bittersweet love song entitled ""Poisonous Love"". Nigel (voiced by Jemaine Clement) had a riotous take on the disco classic ""I Will Survive"".The animation was very vivid and colorful. The nature scenes with the rain forest and the birds and creatures that inhabit it were so vital and alive. The renditions of the animals were all delightfully cute for the younger audiences. Aside from the birds, anteater and frog, we also see capybara (which I did not imagine could be so cute), porcupine, piranha and turtles (who were into Capoeira, slow motion, of course).The rich and happy culture of Brazil were in full display in this film. The film opens with a sequence of New Year's Eve party right on Ipanema Beach. There would be auditions for a Carnival, which would set the scene for various entertaining musical numbers. There is also a thrilling football match between blue vs. red macaws which was excellently executed. I did not get to watch the first Rio film, but my kids did, and they wanted to watch this sequel. Upon watching this, this film talks about a whole different adventure with the lead blue spix macaw characters, Blu and Jewel. The references from the first film seemed adequately addressed. I did not have to know much about the first film to enjoy this one very much. 7/10."
29,Rio 2,7,30 March 2014,Rio in the Amazon,"In this sequence to the enjoyable Rio, Blu and his new family go to the Amazon to see if there is any truth to the rumor says they are not the only blue macaws in the planet. Seeing this movie as a Brazilian makes me feel a little conflicted. First there is a sense of pride of having my country shown in such a beautiful light, and in another it seems that the stereotypes are strong as ever. We don't only thing about Carnaval and Soccer. But that must be how the Chinese feel when they can all fight Kung Fu in movies. Anyway, this is an entertaining film. It has a splendid animation, which is brought to life by the colorful dances and exciting songs practically all samba, we do have other music styles you know), and has some very funny moments, just like the first Rio. However, I have to say the story is the weakest link. It does what every simple animated movie story does, without any surprises. You already know how it will end while you are watching, and since it is not a very interesting ending, I found myself hoping it would somehow find a way to twist my expectations and end in a more mature way. It doesn't.The movie does explain in a quick and simple way why there are more blue macaws in the world and other things established in the first movie that were changed for this one, I'll give it that. But between an attempt of making a case for the deforestation, making a revenge story that gets forgotten in the middle of the movie, and a love story, it all gets a little too much. Not confusing, just unfocused. The characters are all there, with some interesting additions, like the poisonous toad in love, an anteater and plenty of other animals of the Brazilian fauna. All these characters,together with the good jokes and beautiful scenery are what carry the movie. If they hadn't lost themselves with this many characters and fully appreciated them (Nigel was pretty intimidating in the first one)everyone would be better off. In the end, it will entertain kids and adults (like me) who are fond of these kinds of movies. And it will not be a problem accompanying the little ones, if you don't mind some Brazilian propaganda in the middle."
30,Rio 2,10,28 March 2014,Awesome film! Better than the first one.,"JFC I watched Rio 2 yesterday and I'm so mesmerized. The first one was like... pretty and everything. But the story wasn't good enough... for reals, they made a Favela look beautiful. The whole film looked like freaking super Mario sunshine. Great animators/special effects animators, but bad writers. Nothing but a huge propaganda for Brazil, with unrealistic everything. We don't have half of those birds here in the city =__= Yeah, maybe Nico's species, but that's all. God, I know we have a freaking huge forest in the middle of Rio De Janeiro, but the birds in the movie are from amazon and the center-west part of the country...And all the illegal animal trafficking would be OK if it wasn't placed in Rio... We DON'T have it here! I mean, we have, but with parrots and little monkeys, not macaws! And it's a really small thing and it's on control. God. Don't even get me started with the Carnaval stuff... Yes, it is a big party. But NOT ALL Brazilians like that crap. We like it more cause it's a whole week holiday.Anyway... the sequel is a LOT BETTER than the first one. Come on! Blue Sky danced on the face of its enemies. Excellent animation, excellent special effects and gorgeous 3D. Oh, yes! The songs!! Disney, take notes: if you want to put songs on your movies, that's fine, just don't put more songs than actual the regular scenes there! Rio 2 has awesome songs, and they're not too long and not so many, so you don't get bored and angry as hell. The film was funny as hell, and when I watched it, there were only 3 kids on the room, most of the people there were adults, and they laughed. So i recommend it a LOT. The focus is on the birds, but the scenes with Tulio and Linda are good as well. It also talks a little about deforestation, an ACTUAL problem of the amazon region, and that finally takes place in the right location (not in the city...).In conclusion: a film that everyone should watch. Funny for all ages. Beautiful screenplay. Great story. A must see."
31,Rio 2,1,22 June 2014,hated it,"it was awful, the jokes was awful.The script was awful. The characters is annoying and cliché. Its use bad. I love animated movies when its done good interesting and great story. But this is a insult to your IQ and humor. So don't watch this piece of crap ever! i am chocked that the ratings is this high!The jokes where just boring cliché stupid and unfunny Most of the characters i wanted to strangle Andwas up with all the death love and murder plot in this movie? Its that what we want to glorify this days? Murder!? Ffs!Don't WATCH THIS!!!"
32,Rio 2,4,18 April 2014,Disaster sequel that should be missed,"More colorful, more character and more plot that leads it into a disastrous sequel. ""Rio 2"" is a flaw product that would never reach its predecessor's simplicity and adorable as entertainment. The movie seems doesn't have any clear purpose, too loud with added forgettable sing a long scenes and all humors had already been shown at trailer. A zero to hero theme also doesn't work as Blu's character this time is pictured too ridiculous and sometimes annoying. Perhaps the only stuff that could be remembered from this movie was Nigel's weird love story. Overall ""Rio 2"" is disappointing and an unnecessary installment that shouldn't be continued. Some elements from this movie is for kids and feel so exhausting for adult audiences to follow."
33,Rio 2,7,19 April 2014,LOvealble,"What can I say about the most lovalable film. The film centers, Blu(voiced by Jessie Eisenberg) and his family. Blu is a city bird. And his wife bird is a home bird. BLu and the wife discover that there are other members of their species out ""Deep in the Amazon"". We were all treated to a lovely musical score at the of the movie. Most impressive might I add. I was most impressed with the musical score as with any film that has musical score in a film. Nigel(the ""flightless"" bird) who is swearing revenge on Blu for making him ""flightless"" back in the first sequel. He did a fantastic job on ""I Will Survive"". There were great comical aspects of the movie. Blu and family and Co, all move to the Amazon. They come across Blu's wife's father Papap. Twas lovely. And Roberto(voiced by Bruno Mars). The Blu Bids or MacCaws(family name) then find themselves being knocked off the map as a local businessman, wants to plan a development for profitable reasons. So it was Birds V Humans, Linda V Humans. Now even thou Linda and her hubbie are humans, she was the one who found Blue from the first sequel. So all in all I found the movie to be Good, not the kind I would see it several times. I will of course get the soundtrack. But that's as far as it will go."
34,Rio 2,8,12 April 2014,A Delightful Bird Journey.,"Rio 2 is worth appreciation. Drawing out an animation film is not a piece of cake, but the movie crew has successfully managed to go over big. Watching it in the 3D Format enhances the experience making it even better. The plot is based on the same extinct bird family who travel to the amazon to discover the rest of their kind. Special effects and song sequences are impeccably exhibited on the big screen. And as usual, a happy conclusion leaves you mesmerized. In this second installment, a number of new characters have been introduced. The animation effects brought to light and character formations are unambiguously dexterous. Certain sequences symbolize transcendent creativity. Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway, who lent their voices for the main characters were worth admiration. Bruno Mars, Jamie Foxx and the rest of the crew too have been delectable. Film Direction has been adept. Director Carlos Saldhana, bolstered by fellow writers, Don Rhymer and Yoni Brenner has pulled off a splendid task. The film's art department is creditable, beyond any question. Also, Music by John Powell is heart-rending. In other words, the film is a complete entertainment package. From kids to grandparents, the movie is for all the ages. For audiences who take pleasure in watching animation flicks, Rio 2 is very much recommended. Go for it, 'IT'S ON THE AMAZON!'."
35,Rio 2,7,12 April 2014,MY REVIEW: Amazon Fun!!,"Rio 2. Far from perfect in terms of originality but genuinely charming, irresistibly colourful, beautifully choreographed and very nicely done 3D effects, all this makes Rio 2 a winner. Fun shifts from concrete jungle of Rio to the rain forest of Amazon where our couple Blu (played by wonderful nerdy voice of Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel with their three cute kids find that there are many more like them and they are not the only Blue Macaws in this world. Movie takes a been there done that route when Blu struggles to prove himself in front of Jewel's father played by Andy Garcia (Godfather 3 fame). Despite a cliché script, there is hardly a dull moment and a colourful array of side characters and jokes among them keep the fun going. Climax is also done quite nicely with the right message. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for Rio 2. It's not great but it's quite nice way to kill 2 hours on a weekend."
36,Rio 2,,22 October 2016,"Colorful,but nothing special","For someone who have watched Rio,there is no thing special new. On short,this is adventure film that should be for family.There is nice jokes and good sense for humor,but the story is somehow slow and boring. The characters are not new and they are 2D characterized. The only real emphaty I feel is to main character.Fact is that good animation and music don't make film good.Colors and dance makes visual expression good,but not a whole film. Because of slowness of film,it is boring for young kids. But everything is made for kids and you will probably not watch it alone. In short,film is comedy with some message and that is all."
37,Rio 2,,16 July 2015,"People, Not Situations","Getting back into thinking about how narratives get put together, I am reminded of how many radically different strategies there are in approaching a film.If you talk to the (old) Pixar guys, what you'll hear is a focus on story, a cinematic notion of story, above all else. The story comes first; characters emerge whether they are promising franchise characters or not. It is all about making the flow engaging and creating a lasting experience.As I go through my list of valued filmmakers, I can pull out a number of different approaches: Ruiz looks for the dissonance between narrative layers and removes the middle. Cronenberg finds a disturbing edge, creates a situation, then builds things to present it. Spielberg makes comics that are refined in story boards then mechanically reproduced in film. I'll have to think about the varieties.Then we have this guy, Saldanha, who has sold a lot of tickets to happy viewers. The strategy here seems to be to create characters above all else. Make characters. Find some kind of simple enclosing story, it doesn't matter what. Have all the characters create their own local, small static narrative. Then just embellish and display those.I suppose this approach has been refined over on the half hour TeeVee comedy side where story is just an excuse to have character spaces interact. I am always surprised when I see this work, and it plainly does here, though none of the characters are compelling in the ordinary way.I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. In other films, I see stories getting ever more compelling in surprising ways and exhibiting self-awareness with increasing sophistication. These are fun movies, not art films I'm talking about. So it makes sense to have films like Ice Age and Rio for minds that don't work that way, that have shorter narrative attention spans and undeveloped narrative sense.While this is designed for international audiences, and made by a Brazilian and set in Brazil. But most of the voices and nearly all the songs are hip hop urban style that is uniquely American."
38,Rio 2,5,9 February 2015,Relatively undistinguished entry in a crowded field,"""Rio 2"" is a sequel to the original computer-animated hit from 2011. When Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway), two macaws living happily with their three children in Rio de Janeiro, learn that a group of their own kind have been discovered deep in the Amazon jungle, they pack up and head out on a vacation to visit their old homestead and introduce themselves to their long lost kin. What is essentially an avian version of ""the city mouse and the country mouse,"" ""Rio 2"" is bright, spirited and colorful, with just enough of an ecological message to lend it a social conscience. Yet, for all its virtues, the movie comes across like the assembly-line product it is, marked by stereotypical characters and lackluster storytelling. The cluttered cast includes Andy Garcia, George Lopez, Jamie Foxx, Bruno Mars, Rita Moreno, and Tracey Morgan as an assortment of compatriots, villains and sidekicks, but the movie itself might have benefited from a more disciplined and focused approach to the material."
39,Rio 2,7,13 July 2014,It works as a sequel as it follows up the life of Blu and Jewel after the first film.,"Rio 2 (2014) is fun, adorable and entertaining. It works as a sequel as it follows up the life of Blu and Jewel after the first film. Sadly, in general it is much inferior compared to its first film in terms of concept and story line as it is not as meaningful or as adventurous as its predecessor.Rio (2011) is one of my top favorite animated feature so I had extra high expectations in various aspects. >< Nonetheless, the film has assembled menagerie of wild characters which are voiced by amazing voice casts in addition to its top notch visuals and depictions of animals' lives and cultures so this film actually does not disappoint!"
40,Rio 2,8,26 May 2014,Rio 2,"I had the opportunity watch Rio 2 in theater recently and it is one gem of a movies. The graphical demonstration depicted is mesmerizing. The movie captured the attention of audience right from the word go. I liked the natural mountainous back-drops along with huge water falls which added icing on the cake. The story was also very touchy and had the message for all of us to follow. There are certain aspects we need think about like retention of other living organism on earth instead of just thinking about our business and earning money. I would suggest all of you to watch this picture. This movie can be watched with family as well and I think, it is suitable for audiences of all age groups from children to old people."
41,Rio 2,7,25 April 2014,Enjoyable if a bit over-stuffed,"Neurotic parrot Blu goes with wife Jewel and their kids to meet her family in the jungle. Illegal deforestation is also going on in the vicinity. Oo-er.This CGI kids' film with an environmental message is a sequel to an original I didn't see: this did not prove to be a problem. It is quite good fun, albeit I thought it was rather overstuffed with different groups who were at odds with each other - Blu, the blue macaw tribe (led by Jewel's father), the environmentalists, the illegal tree fellers, the red macaw tribe, Nigel who hates Blu, and there are even divisions within Blu's family group by the time we approach the final sequences. The central story is fish-out-of-water city dweller failing to impress father-in-law. It is a story which has been told a thousand times, but probably not to the target audience for this film.It is enjoyable and well made (the jungle settings are particularly nicely done) with some fun, though unmemorable, songs which are well staged. I had a soft spot for poisonous tree frog Gabi, besotted with cockatoo Nigel, a pleasingly surreal touch."
42,Rio 2,10,28 June 2014,Rating less than 10 is cruel!!,"I saw the rating below 7. i mean come on. Is the raters blind or just pervertedly biased. This movie deserves every bit of 10 out of 10. What do they want , A dead vampire trying to be horny? or a stupid novel in which characters more than hair on testicles fighting for an iron throne?Rio was amazing. The characters, singing, colors, animations, message, fun and amusing creativity. Thats it. Anyone who rates it less than 10 needs a psychiatric evaluation respecting the personal rights of rating what you want but still, Come on Man!!! 6.6 just, even an ugly dead Thai movie can get more than that. :P"
43,Rio 2,4,27 June 2014,"No original story, a bombardment of clichés","I'm not the movie-bashing type and I don't easily call a movie bad but for I will be honest about my review. Like the majority of others, I came to watch Rio 2 after having had watched Rio 1. In fact, I did re-watch Rio 1 just to catch up right before this movie.Rio 1 I would have given 6-7 stars. It's story, while not the most original is durable, with some gags, a strong voice cast and spectacular CGI animation. It's music is catchy and has a strong rhythm, but its soundtrack was mediocre and hardly memorable. But we're not here to talk about Rio 1, so I'll get on with it. Rio 2 was a major disappointment. Much work goes into the production of film from various areas of expertise. In this case, I felt that some aspects were quite strong but other areas were extremely weak. Rio 2- the animation is spectacular. Rio and the *other places* are animated beautifully- with a lot of attention and care taken to create some spectacular, breathtaking backgrounds. I thought it was slightly over the top with the fauna- we don't have to see every individual leaf, that's just a waste of time. But that's a tiny nit-picky detail. The birds and other characters are animated quite well, but as with CGI too perfectly but the motion is very natural and realistic. The colors and graphic style as far as CGI animated features go are very pleasing to the eye and really evoke the colorful, vibrant world of Rio & *other places* The voice cast was spectacular and was a merit to the film. Very strong voice acting, but I won't go into details for spoilers. Characters- this wasn't done overly well. The original characters have remained pretty much as they were in the last movie and plenty of new characters are produced, all with their own individual quirky personalities. I felt some of those personalities were over the top and perhaps too 'out there'. Character development was lacking- I saw no character development with any characters which was a shame because there was so much potential to really experiment and craft some really believable, three dimensional characters. But they remained essentially one-dimensional. So character development was sub par, but character design and animation- two thumbs up!Music- the film score and soundtrack were a major let down. With South American music there is so much scope for experimenting with rhythm, especially with percussion but the score consisted of pretty much all major themes and music from the previous film, nothing new. It was mediocre at best and the songs were very average and not memorable at all. Overall, the soundtrack and film score are not going to remembered once the credits pop up. Story- the biggest flaw. The previous film didn't have a particularly unique storyline but it was executed nicely in the original film. The story here is so overused and heavily clichéd that I found myself getting bored. If you decide to use clichés, why not put a twist or have a fresh take on it? As it happens, everything was very predictable and unexciting. There are also too many plot lines which didn't help with character development. Not much original, unique ideas were used and there were so many gags. Even if you achieve technical perfection on an animated film, a bad story can really destroy it and that is what I feel was done here. When giving this rating, I gave animation a 7, music a 5, character development a four and story a 2. But the story was just so bad I think it wouldn't do justice to other animated features and so I settled for a 4. When I established my final rating it was NOT a comparison to its predecessor- the original was used just to highlight a few differences in quality. To conclude: A wonderful technical execution of a CGI animated feature with some pleasing artistic aspects but overall story was what turned this 'quite nice' film ,a predictable, heavily clichéd and reused pile of pretty feathers. This was a sequel which didn't need to be made, which didn't make any sense to create. I hope you will enjoy this film more that I did."
44,Rio 2,7,1 April 2014,Fun For All Ages!,"The original film took some $486 million worldwide (the majority coming from international) and while Rio 2 should come close to that figure  especially given its headline-friendly voice cast and savvy marketing campaign - much will depend on how other family films fare over the busy Easter period.What made the original such fun was the wonderful way it painted Rio de Janeiro. The sequel smartly opens back in the city, this time on New Year's Eve, dwelling on the humankind partying on Copacabana beach and the animals (mainly the birds) having their own bash on the iconic Christ the Redeemer statute which overlooks Rio. It is an appealing and entertaining start that reintroduces the main characters.Rio 2 - offered up so much more unique entertainment that this largely jungle-bound romp, which often plays more like a musical than a family adventure."
45,Rio 2,10,31 March 2014,Lindo!!!,"beautiful movie! extremely well done. begins with the new years eve, all dressed in white as is the tradition here, and takes the characters on a journey through Brazil until arriving at amazon jungle. the rivalry between the blue and red macaws are a representation of a popular festival in the northern region of Brazil, where there is a major dispute between the blue ox and red ox, the people of the amazon have their favorite and they love it so much that until the Coke is sold in a blue packaging besides the red to please all. shows the natural and cultural beauties of Brazil! and still really funny you can see a little ""wreaking ball"" also some other movies quotes!"
46,Rio 2,9,18 April 2014,Best in Class 3D !!!,"I Love The Movie ! Over All Animation Guys Done Their Best Job Handoff to them , more over turtle slow motions was so nice everybody Had A Laughing in the Theatre, then soccer game was superb, blue's same side goal & all new music and dance are really watchable,really surprise blue and his 3 child. boat horn scene was nice, lots of comedy on this movie don't miss this RIO2 Kids .. Enjoy the movie !! And Finally Thanks to All crew Members in this movie keep up your job .. waiting for Rio3 ...cheers!!!cheers!!!cheers!!!cheers!!!"
47,Rio 2,4,25 June 2014,Unnacceptable for very young children - so sad.,OK seriously..... regarding this alleged kids film RIO 2 - as the parent of a 4 year old.....I realize now I probably need to prescreen all of my child's films more diligently than I have in the past...bad daddy BAD!! ..... even if it is rated G......What the hell 20th Century Fox?!!! Seriously?!!! you are a bunch of degenerates - An upbeat musical number where cute amazon birds get unceremoniously devoured ...no sorry ....mashed/crushed.. by Crocs?!!!....Brazilian jungle hamsters in cheerleader formation get their flesh visibly removed ....no sorry ....violently stripped to skeletal remains by piranhas?!! Then a jaguar eats and swallows the remaining cute hamster center stage? This was a tremendous joy to try and explain/gloss over/move along/try to downplay to my son this evening who had no way to process it and will likely have nightmares tonight..... unbelievable....I'm certainly no prude and genuinely love dark/black humor but not in a supposed kids movie.....I am seriously pi**ed off! So unnecessary. 20th Century Fox you are on notice!
48,Rio 2,10,30 March 2014,Loved it,"I absolutely loved it in 3D, it was way better than the first one, the music, the dancing, everything about this film was amazing, the action, drama , comedy, music and romance was a all amazing, i would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a animated film or Rio fan, it was truly and utterly amazing, Nigel was kind of amusing is some points but his audition was fantastic even though he's not my favorite character in the film, my favorite character is Blu and also Jewel, they are my favorite romantic couple since i saw them in the first film, I would love to see it again.It is one of the most family fun sequels i've ever seen and i hope they do a third one or maybe a TV series, Carlos Saldanha has made a very good second installment to the Rio franchise and should definitely make another one but with an even better and more fun plot."
49,Rio 2,9,6 August 2014,Great Family Movie!,"I just loved Rio 2! The music is amazing, the story is funny and engaging for all ages, while the quality of the animation is quite superb. It is a departure from the Walt Disney style cartoons that have been boring me for the past years, with the exception of Frozen. Rio 2 is another success story that I hope will have additional sequels in the future. The cast is brilliant, well versed in Portuguese while the singing is creative, exquisite and fun. The songs are full of life and rhythm. I truly enjoyed the beautiful experience that comes from the tropics about Brazilian culture, the environment, life, fun, and music, all in one, via Rio 2. Cannot wait for Rio 3!"
50,Rio 2,3,3 July 2014,"very dull and boring, nice animation but the film was dull","The first thing I thought when this film ended was how does a kid sit through that whole film and not get bored? There is just way too much talking and doing nothing in the film and not enough action and adventure.Yes it's colorful and the animation is nice, but the story itself is boring and clichéd.I liked the intro because I have travelled around south America and it was nice to see a good animation of rio and the good music gave a nice vibe to the introduction but after that it went downhill for me, just way to much birds chattering away in trees and not enough action and adventure.when you compare this to the likes of toy story, up, shrek, wall-e and even ratatouille, this movie comes far behind in the ""pecking"" order."
51,Rio 2,6,17 April 2014,Not too good,"When I saw the trailer of the movie I was expecting a lot with the movie. I thought it would be better than previous animated movies but I was wrong. First half of the movie was boring. But the second half was amazing. Second half was packed with actions,comedy and awesome 3D effects. Climax action was superb. The second half was a fun ride. The animation was nice. This movie an above average movie. Plot: 3/10Animation: 9/103D Effects: 10/10Comedy: 5/10"
52,Rio 2,8,12 April 2014,"A familiar plot, but colorful with nice music festival","It has a familiar style of plot and it seems that the screen writer who has recycled the old idea has done a good job for the first half of the story but turning lazy for the second half in which everything ends too fast and too simply. It has a great scope of Amazon, good awareness on environmental issues but it is even clear that the way of narrating the second half is to convenient the children but a let down to general audiences. Despite the over simple and straightforward story line, the film has successfully mesmerized one's heart by retaining the colorful adventure, creative and enjoying musical scores and expansion of adorable animal characters voiced by superior cast from its predecessor."
53,Rio 2,6,3 August 2016,Too Many Subplots but still Fun and Entertaining,"What can I say about the Rio movies? Well they're very fun, silly, upbeat and cute with a cute romance and dazzling animation. However, Rio 2 is definitely the weaker of the 2 movies. It feels much sillier and over the top than the first movie. At least the first movie had a sweet center and could be taken seriously despite being a bit silly. With Rio 2, every other scene is a joke and most scenes are way over the top and goofy. It doesn't quite get to the point where it's cringe worthy but it does come close. The other major problem with this movie is how many subplots there are, I mean it's just ridiculous. At least the first movie had one main plot with one side-plot but Rio 2 has 10 subplots at least. Let's see, we have, the city boy in the country, the hard to please the father cliché, the jealousy story despite the couple being married and have kids, Linda and Tulio searching for blue macaws, the red macaws and blue macaws playing football, Blu and Jewel's kids, one of the kids putting on a talent show, the environmental message, one of the birds looking for a new hat, Nigel plotting against Blu and Jewel and the poison dart frog with a huge crush on Nigel. Did I miss a few? So as you can probably tell, none of these subplots get enough focus. The movie often sporadically switches between stories until the climax where every single subplot crashes together and resolve the plot. Because of this, the movie is extremely sloppy, scattered and unfocused that it becomes hard to follow. Most of the subplots could've been cut out since they're so meaningless. The only ones that felt necessary were the loggers' subplot, Nigel's subplot and maybe Linda and Tulio's subplot. However, I don't really like the former subplot either because like many others, I am sick and tired of movies shoving this message down our throats. It worked in Wall-E only because it's Pixar and Andrew Stanton. However, to this movie's credit, it doesn't get that much focus and it isn't shoved down your throats as much as some other animated movies. *cough cough* Epic *cough* Ferngully *cough* Avatar *cough cough* Cloudy with a *cough* Chance of *cough* Meatballs. However, this movie isn't all bad. Despite being extremely over the top, Nigel is a fun villain and the poison dart frog that has a crush on him is a fun character and yeah I ship it. I really did love the first 25 minutes of this film where we see Blu and Jewel interact with their kids and it shows their differing ideas on raising the kids and we do get a fun song and a cool montage. However once they started introducing all those subplots like I said, the movie started getting really sloppy. Anyways, I also have to give props to the animation of this movie. It's some of the most fluid, colorful, fast-paced, and smooth animation Blue Sky has ever done along with the first Rio, and The Peanuts Movie. Every little detail of the animation is accounted for including every little feather and leaves on the trees however, it still is it's own style and doesn't look overly realistic. It's still catoony and over the top but also stylistic and colorful. The songs, as few as there are, are the highlights of the movie and why it deserves to exist. The animation really shines in these scenes, the instrumentals and the music itself is really nice and easy on the ears. I'll admit, the humor was also pretty good at parts. Overall, this movie is a fun watch but not as good as the first. I'd say at best it's a mindless time-killer."
54,Rio 2,6,13 February 2016,Cheerful animated fun.,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. It's simple, bright, colourful fun. It won't challenge you or surprise you but who cares. It's lively and spirited with beautiful hip shaking music. The Blue Macaw dance number is especially fantastic.I also love Blu and Jewel's three little children. They are cute yet sassy and a nice addition to the animated cast of characters. Tiago's my favourite. He's a little dork with his mini goggles.The overall story is nothing exceptional and filled with clichés but kids and adults alike can enjoy it. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's better than the first one but it's comparable."
55,Rio 2,10,12 September 2015,"An awesome, great, well deserved sequel","Rio 2 is the perfect sequel. it does a fantastic job taking off from where the previous film ends and literally soars to great heights introducing new ideas and with an interesting plot. it's so romantic that Blu and Jewel are a married couple with children. i only thought they were boyfriend/girlfriend. The film also has a great environmental message: SAVE THE RAINFOREST!!!!! It's powerfully moving, an awesome computer animation, brightly colored, has a lot of twists and turns, and a truly happy ending. I also like how the red and blue macaws team up and defeat the illegal loggers. Also, when Big Boss is eaten by a boa constrictor is quite an unexpected twist. I wonder what they are gonna come up with next, Rio 3 in Space? Whatever Carlos decides, I hope he does include a third film in the trilogy."
56,Rio 2,5,25 May 2015,Never Flies.,"Rio 2 (2014): Dir: Carlos Saldanha / Voices: Jessie Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Jemaine Clement, Kristin Chenoweth, Bruno Mars: As with the wretched Crocodile Dundee 2, this animated sequel reverses the events of the first film. This time it is discovered that Blu and Jewel are not the only blue macaws in the world as more have been discovered in the Amazon. Blu and Jewel live in a bird sanctuary under protection but Jewel desires to return to her roots. Blu is reluctant but at the urge of his three ambitious hatchlings and other feathered friends he relents. Once there Jewel is reunited with her family and this is where familiar formula elements rain in. Her uptight father will, of course, not accept Blu, leaving him to have to prove himself. And let us not forget that male suitor who is so much better than Blu at pretty much everything. They are also being pursued by cockatoo Nigel out for revenge on Blu after the events of the first film. He is joined by an affectionate poison dart frog named Gabi and an anteater with a tongue for many talents. Despite dim plotting and formula story telling the climax works with the Amazon clashing with human greed. Jessie Eisenberg voices Blu who is adjusting to non-city life. Anne Hathaway voices Jewel who seeks home. Jemaine Clement and Kristin Chenoweth provide much hilarity voicing Nigel and Gabi. Bruno Mars voices the potential suitor to Jewel whom is slicker than Blu and seems to be better at everything. Unfortunately the gorgeous Amazon presented cannot make up for a drab screenplay that ultimately goes to the birds. Score: 5 ½ / 10"
57,Rio 2,7,7 May 2015,Lacked the charm of it's Prequel!!!,"Rio 2 is a 2014 American 3D computer-animated musical adventure- comedy film produced by Blue Sky Studios and directed by Carlos Saldanha. It is the sequel to the 2011 computer-animated film Rio and the studio's first film to have a sequel outside of their existing Ice Age franchise. The title refers to the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, where the first film was set and Rio 2 begins, though most of its plot occurs in the Amazon rainforest.Blue macaws Blu (Jesse Eisenberg), Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and their three children are comfortably settled in the city -- perhaps too comfortably. Jewel fears that the children are becoming more like humans than birds. After learning that she and Blu may not be the last blue macaws after all, Jewel decides that their little family should visit the Amazon jungle. It's there that Blu meets his formidable father-in-law (Andy Garcia) and goes beak-to-beak with archnemesis Nigel (Jemaine Clement)."
58,Rio 2,7,6 January 2015,If you liked the first movie you will enjoy this cute family movie.,"Rio 2 is the follow up to the 2011 animated movie from 20th Century Fox and tells the story of Blu and his mate Jewel who are now parents to three blue macraws and they travel to the Amazon alongside their mates the tropical bird(voiced by George Lopez),the red bird(voiced by Wil.I.Am)and of course the yellow bird with the tin as a hat on his head(voiced by Jamie ""Electro from The Amazing Spiderman 2"" Foxx)to discover that they are not the only macaw's in existence. But it turns out that the macaws are related to Jewel as she is reunited with her father(voiced by Andy Garcia from Christmas In Conway)and Blu gets to meet his father in law(yeah its pulling a Shrek 2 stunt now with the plot).But we later meet Nigel again who is out for revenge and we get to meet new charcthers including a pink frog(voiced by Kristen Chenoworth from the Tinkerbell franchise)and Bruno Mars as Roberto(who acts like a ladies killer in this movie).Overall I found this one very colourful and vibrant. The music is forgettable to be honest just like the first movie but it was a entertaining movie. Cute and fun. Check it out and see it for yourself.7.2/10"
59,Rio 2,5,14 November 2014,A Re-Tread of the Previous Film,"Rio 2 lacks the heart and emotional resonance of the first installment into the franchise, and tries to expand its horizons from the already huge Rio de Janeiro, and head outwards into the rest of Brazil. But whilst the film expands and heightens its grandeur in regards to scope and animation, the central story is entirely predictable and continues to build on the clichéd domesticated vs. wild debate that waged within the first film.The film is saved thanks to competent voice work from Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg, and the aforementioned animation is still absolutely stunning, Blue Sky Studios not disappointing in the slightest in this regard. Yet ever still, the re-use of certain villains, plot points, and the irritatingly tame inclusion of clichés will do little to impress the adult viewers dragged along to view the film with their children; though even the children may very well be bored with this cluster of predictability.5.2You can check out more reviews at www.entjunkie.blogspot.com"
60,Rio 2,,7 November 2014,Fun,"This animation tells the story of the blue macaws flying into the amazon to find other blue macaws.I was thoroughly bored and irritated by the first Rio, so ""Rio 2"" is a nice surprise. This film is colorful and fun. The plot is about love and family, and you cannot go wrong with these fundamental ideas. The birds sometimes burst into spontaneous singing and dancing, but it's not as annoying as I usually find it to be. In fact, the use of ""I Will Survive"" is really fun, and starkly contrasts the character that sings it. That's a joke for adult viewers, children won't get it. The ending is fun as well. I enjoyed watching ""Rio 2""."
61,Rio 2,6,29 September 2014,Rio 2,"I can finally add a new film to my ""Sequels Nobody Really Asked For"" list,so congratulations RIO 2!You've joined the class of works like a G.I. JOE:RETALIATION and CARS 2.RIO 2 is the sequel to the surprise hit RIO that opened back in '11 and meets up again with the last Blu Macaws on the planet;Blu,Jewel,and their three kids.They're enjoying life in a wildlife protective center located in beautifully animated Rio De Janeiro.When their caretakers are exploring the Amazon rain forest,they come across evidence that there might just be an entire flock of Blu Macaws still alive in the wild in the forest.Blu and the gang of fowl fools hear of this and decide to go find answers for themselves and bump into no good humans,old enemies,and maybe some long lost family.And there's music.Lots of music.And a Nicki Minaj sloth. I enjoyed the original RIO,it was a fun,beautiful animated family movie with enjoyable musical scenes and some pretty impressive animation.In hindsight it's no surprise that movie was gonna make bank but this sequel honestly passed me by quick.You don't get a completely gripping story as you would with Pixar or a good Dreamworks movie.The story is pretty basic and linear,which obviously makes sense being this is a movie clearly aimed to a young demographic.Three acts,happy ending,with plenty of fluff thrown in.If I'm coming off as completely crapping on this flick,let me say it's not a bad movie at all.It's just so easy.The song sequences can range from being Bluray beautiful to being just a pop music insert. The animation is strong with this one though,the big shots of the city of Rio and green forests of the Amazon really please the eyes and the characters are all colorful,likable and cute as they should.My favorite character was actually the most developed and had this interesting hook to her character,it's the painfully adorable poison dart frog.Loved her. There'a plenty of star voice talent and they all bring real life to each of their characters,JEMAINE CLEMENT is awesome in his return as the evil Nigel.ANDY GARCIA is in this movie but kinda just cashes it in IMO.BRUNO MARS is a new voice and he was decent.He didn't annoy me as much as I thought. RIO 2 is a movie meant and made for kids.Maybe around 12 and younger,but THERE ARE those moments for adults to chuckle at.The music and animation are also more than enough to warrant that I RECOMMEND A RENTAL!The Bluray would be a good family movie night rental but it doesn't really reach the caliber of the big boys like Disney or Miyazaki."
62,Rio 2,7,29 August 2014,Back to basics,"Sort of or also ""Meet the birds"" could be another title for this. I like the fact, that Rio 2 does evolve and they move on (literally) to other places. It's also nice and good because you're getting the characters you know, but also new ones, which up the ante. New conflicts arise and especially our main bird feels like a fish out of water in his new situation (no pun intended).It might be a bit too neat for some in resolving some the issues that arise during the course of the movie, but it is a kids movie, isn't it? So while it is also predictable and puts characters very clearly defined against each other, it does a fine job with it. More than decent enough and will be liked by children, which this is mainly aimed at"
63,Rio 2,6,18 August 2014,Bluebirds are back,"Brazilian-born director Carlos Saldanha (after working on the Ice Age movies earlier in his career) is back too for the follow-up just like (voice) actors Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway three years after the original movie. This review comes from the perspective of somebody who has not seen the original yet. I assume the party guests early on and those who babysit and join the birds had major roles in the first film. So it was a nice inclusion for everybody who liked the original, even if these characters did not really have much screen time here. Other than that there is not much point or development to the characters.This sequel deals mostly about Blu and Jewel finding more of their kind. The one thing I liked most about ti, however, was the part which deals with humans destroying the rain forest. And said rain forest is truly beautifully animated in this movie, possibly its highlight. The story never really dragged too much and was pretty decent too. The only major flaw was the whole casting show plot. It was never funny and just felt totally out of place fishing for cheap laughs. There were few really big highlight and flaws in these 100 minutes, but this was certainly one of them. The film also suffered a bit from having simply too many antagonists: the builders, Eduardo, Roberto, the red parrots, the cockatoo with his frog lady. Admittedly, they made the most of that near the end when they managed to unite everybody to fight against the humans destroying their rain forest which was quite a nice turn. The story of animals sticking together to save their living environment is always a nice one and ""saved"" (although it wasn't so bad that it needed saving) the movie here.Rio 2 won't make a place under my favorite animated movies by any means, but it's certainly worth a watch thanks to the beautiful animation and also will make you laugh on several occasions. Recommended."
64,Rio 2,7,30 July 2014,I kind of liked liked it,"I could just simply say this was a OK movie. Humor 9\10 Almost every joke gave me a chuckle.Animation 8\10 Average. Nothing special about it.Plot 7\10 The plot was good but it has been taken in so many movies and TV shows.Confusinnees 3\10 Well, the very beginning is confusing. Why are they celebrating new years? And you think Nigel is the bad guy when actually the humans are the real bad guys. Dragednees 4\10 The movie dragged when they where moving in to the Amazon.You don't want any confusinnes or dragednees in any movie. Well, if your a music lover, nature lover, and bird lover you'd love this movie."
65,Rio 2,,29 July 2014,Adequate follow-up to 'Rio' but not quite as enchanting.,"It was almost three years ago that we saw 'Rio', a very nice animated movie about rare blue Macaws. Here is the summary I wrote about that one:It starts in Brazil when animal smugglers are illegally trapping various species of wildlife. A pretty blue one ends up falling off a truck in Minnesota, and becomes a lady's pet. Some years later an ornithologist from Brazil, looking for the rare blue Macaw, comes upon the bird, now an adult named Blu, and tries to convince the owner that they need to travel to Rio de Janeiro to hopefully mate with the last know female blue Macaw. They are reluctant but finally go.In 'Rio 2' there of course the male and female blue Macaws, again voiced by Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg. They have become a couple with a family with cute young birds. They are in Rio but see something on the news about other blue Macaws possibly living in the deep Amazon and they travel there.The main story becomes about the birds and the conservationists trying to stop the illegal logging which not only is destroying native growth, but is also endangering habitats.My favorite new character is a colorful frog voiced by Kristen Chenoweth. She is very lively and sings beautifully. Overall there are several musical numbers and the movie is a pleasant diversion."
66,Rio 2,3,22 April 2014,"Rio 2 may give us birds, I just wanted to give the movie the bird","Animation companies are under a lot of pressure to bring a film that all audiences are going to enjoy, while making sure that children are entertained the most. To be fair, the route of hitting more of a general audience then just the kids is a good idea. After all, there are a lot of adults (including myself) that really enjoy animated features. Everybody knows that Disney will continue to deliver some great animated movies. We expect the same thing from Pixar and their great storytelling. We expect it from DreamWorks animation and their colorful designs. What about Fox's Blue Sky Studios animation company?Well I don't know what exactly Fox is doing with Blue Sky Studios. I guess they intend on being the company that caters to mostly children. I get that a lot from other movies like the Ice Age franchise, Robots, and last year's Epic. I didn't like any of these films, because they seem more content of looking funny as apposed to actually being funny. Then we got Rio in 2011, which finally gave me a Blue Sky Studios production that I liked. While it's fish out of water story was not original, it was likable enough with it's Brazilian soundtrack, colorful characters, and actual personality development. Rio 2 tries to replicate it's original filmperhaps too closely.Set a few years after the first movie, blue macaws Blu (played by Jessie Eisenberg) and Jewel (played by Anne Hathaway) now have a family of three children, Carla, Bia, and Tango, all living within a bird sanctuary that was set up by Blu's owners, Linda (played by Leslie Mann) and Tulio (played by Rodrigo Santoro). Life in Rio de Janerio seems all right for everyone, but Jewel thinks that her family is too domesticated. But they have to live there, as their all supposedly the last of their species.That changes when the macaw family receive word from the news that wild blue macaws may still exist in the Amazon forest. Jewel thinks this is a good time to take the family into the rain forest to find the other birds. Blu's nervous, but agrees to do this to please his family. They take off from the city, along with other birds Rafael (played by George Lopez) Nico (played by Jamie Fox) and Pedro (played by Will. I .Am). They make the long flight alright and find other blue macaws, including Jewel's long lost father Eduardo (played by Andy Garcia) and her old friend Roberto (played by Bruno Mars). At this point, the movie also throws in Loggers looking to tear down the blue macaws home, and wanted revenge by the first films villain Nigel the cockatoo (played by Jemaine Clement).As you can tell, Rio 2 really tries to throw a lot of story for something that's meant for children. I wouldn't mind if it was at least interesting, but here's the problem; Rio 2 is just the first movie all over again. It's a fish out of water story, it's another environmental agenda scenario, it's a clash of the domesticated and wild, and the villain here is the same guy from before.It's okay to borrow a few elements from before, but this movie is a simple cut and paste job; just add a Meet the Parents subplot, a few new characters and catchy songs, and there you go, instant sequel. But surprisingly, they don't copy over what made the original good. While Rio had a subtle environmental message that a lot of people didn't know about (bird smugglers), Rio 2 is a jackhammer of ""save the rain forest"" stuff and ""parrots should be wild"" messages. It really want the audience to remember this, but it comes off as obnoxious. Also, why loggers? We've seen that hundreds of times before. The only thing that I did like was the bird that could have been cut out, Nigel. He boasts a cocky, performer personality that got an occasional chuckle. Otherwise, Rio 2 was made just to sell it's soundtrack (it's not bad though)I'll give this three save the rain forest bumper stickers out of ten. Parents, I'll give you some tips right now; skip seeing Rio 2, buy the soundtrack instead, watch the first movie, and go to a zoo to learn about macaws in an educational environment. Rio 2 is a party I won't be returning to."
67,Rio 2,1,7 July 2014,Worst movie ever,"I have seen many movies in 2014, and out of my whole life, Rio 2 has GOT to be the worst movie EVER. The only funny thing about it is when Blu and Jewel go to the Amazon and Blu brings a GPS. ""I told you that you shouldn't trust that lady."" That is probably the only funny quote in the entire movie. So overall, do NOT see this movie unless you are invulnerable to bad movies.(Well, of course, there is a song which was alright, but still a bad movie.)This is a movie I wouldn't even make my worst enemy have to see, because it's so bad."
68,Rio 2,7,21 April 2014,"""Birds of blue feather have to stick together.""","I'll get the positives out of the way first. This is an extremely vibrant movie and the colors are superb. Particularly dazzling was the song and dance of the blue macaws in the musical number followed later by the soccer match against the red birds. There was also some clever dialog and interesting bits including the capoeira turtles, which I would have welcomed more of; unfortunately they were kind of a throw away. Overall, an entertaining movie.But here's the rub. Virtually every movie coming out today has some political subtext to it. Maybe I'm overly sensitive to it because I watch the news every day, and not the mainstream variety. The message of militant environmentalism is a not so subtle subtext to the picture, and smacks of indoctrinating young minds not only against improving mankind by using nature's resources responsibly, but by advocating against it. The theme is verbalized by the blue macaw Roberto - ""Humans destroy everything."" That by itself would be damaging enough to young psyches, but then you have a number of scenes that aren't particularly kid friendly to my mind. The black panther devouring an unsuspecting capybara comes to mind specifically.And here's an observation that's right out there but will hardly be picked up by the average movie goer. The Amazon bird world, by their own admission, is divided about evenly between the red (Republican) and the blue (Democrat) macaws. They live in a sort of contrived semblance of acceptance with each other, but they don't miss an opportunity to zing each other when it's advantageous to do so. Even my summary line attests to the idea; I can't remember which character stated it, possibly Eduardo as the nominal leader of the blues. Then, when Blu becomes determined to make his stand against the loggers, he implored Eduardo to let him help by stating - ""You know the jungle, I know humans."" You know, as in those lousy, money grubbing, forest destroying, incorrigible humans.Look, I'm all for protecting the environment and using nature's resources responsibly. But the presentation is always one sided, and when it's packaged all pretty with colors and song, it becomes propaganda. And that's not what I want to see when I want to be entertained. I'd rather the politics be kept out of it."
69,Rio 2,10,17 April 2014,Rio 2 Is The Second Best Film In The Series,"Rio came out in 2011 and got great reception however this latest release is not being appreciated much i can see why as a lot of others movies release along with it the box office results are low i don't care about critical reception it kills a film so whatever critics are saying it please avoid them they are haters this film is second best in the series i loved it for what it was it will work for you too just keep the expectations below as the story is changed a bit in this sequel.The Plot:some times after the events of first film Blue,Jewel and their kids are traveling from Rio DE Janeiro to amazon rain-forest they encounter Nigel again but Jewel also meets her father too as companies are moving in to destroy wild life they plan and work together to save their land & remaining endangered Macaw parrots.The Cast is good the voice acting goes slightly wrong but still the dialogs are funny i don't know if kids are watching it or not but adults and older guys are totally loving this film here in Asia.The animation is improved the best thing was dancing scenes here and Nigel turned good for once i waited for Rio 2 so long but there is also a film called Delhi Safari out there that shares a similar story i am saying this because of what happened in the second half of the film is totally like that but this is way better anytime.Overall if you love the first part then you will love this one too i cant wait for the 3rd film my rating for Rio 2 2014 is 10/10:Highly Recommended."
70,Rio 2,7,14 April 2014,"Rio 2 is pretty enjoyable, just not as much as the previous one","Having enjoyed the first Rio so much a few years ago, I was very stoked to see this sequel which I just did with my movie theatre-working friend. There were plenty of funny stuff for the first 30 minutes but then I noticed some plot threads that initially seemed unrelated that threatened to slow things down. Also, the serious one about the possible destruction of rain forests also threatened to make it less fun than previously. Still, like I said, there were still plenty of funny scenes and lines that still can entertain at the beginning and end. I especially liked the addition of Kristin Chenoweth as a frog in love with...oh, just watch the movie, if you're curious enough. So on that note, Rio 2 is worth a look."
71,Rio 2,5,11 September 2014,Trite and forgettable.,"This film is a flamboyant reminder that we are no longer in the golden age of animated movies. In a decade where even Pixar can no longer churn out family classics, it might be a bit unrealistic to expect Blue Sky Studio's latest entry to combat the downward spiral. Rio 2 is as loud and colorful as you'd expect, and a bit grating to sit through for the sake of your loved ones. All flash and no substance, this movie is a hodgepodge of common animated tropes, afraid to rock the boat in any way. Included:'Do anything for family.' 'Races must stick together.' 'Racism and xenophobia are cool until the plot's climax forces them to work together.' 'Kids like outdated pop culture references, right?'The highest compliment that I can give is that the dialogue elicits a few chuckles and makes the film seem surprisingly self aware at times. Sadly, the laughs are few and drowned out by the movie's spastic pacing, which shuffles through its scenes like a deck of cards.Kids will love it and forget it, while adults will merely tolerate it and forget it. Rent instead of buy."
72,Rio 2,7,9 September 2014,"Fror all the 'blu' fans out there, never miss!","Having watched the all exciting part One; and waiting for part Two - well, that was an eternal wait. (Watched it maybe a few days after the global release, but a bit late to write the review). And all I did was praying that the movie kept its set standards. The movie is totally based on the Amazon jungle; and it portrays more of wild beauty and scenic brilliance. The colors created in the movie, esp in a few shots were awesome. If you are not the jungle guy, or if you cant admire wildlife, this one is not for you. And a very important request, watch this movie on a HUGE screen; for sure. There is so much of details in each of the scenes, and if you pay more attention to each of it, you will enjoy it much more.And 'blu' really turns out to be the ultimate hero; and the movie has left us with enough reason to watch out for part3.I was actually quite sad to see a grown up 'blu' and 'Jewel'. But their kids, wowww.. They were scintillating, and downright naughty. Truly ruled every scene which they were made part of.Comparison with one: - Well, i would never rate it as high as part one but a few things in Rio2 were exceptional. - The songs; and especially the dance sequences associated with it: Trust me, it cannot be better. They were too good to be part of an anime movie - Part 2, unlike part 1, conveys a sense of social/environmental responsibility and sends out a message to protect Nature unlike the previous version of the movie which ideally dint have a message. - There was less of romance in Rio2; and whatever was there was a perfect blend to the whole story-line. 'Gabi' was a decent addition to the whole story. - They could have improved upon the humor quotient of the movie. I felt it was really lacking considering the fact that we had the likes of 'Luiz' the bull-dog and others; but 'Nigel' the cockatoo makes a decent attempt to be an object of scorn."
73,Rio 2,10,25 August 2014,how good the movie is,"WOW!!! it was just awesome, found some funny parts, but i won't say them, that would be spoiling the movie, and i don't like to spoil movies, so i will just say that it is a awesome movie, would defiantly recommend the movie to anyone. the movie has some sad parts, but what is a movie if it doesn't have some sad parts. it has some funny parts, but, if a movie is going to be good, it has to have some funny parts. it's also got some weird parts, but that is to be expect, there were some in the first. so you should just go a watch the movie, to find out what i am talking aboutIT IS JUST AN Awesome MOVIE"
74,Rio 2,7,26 July 2014,It's a musical treat!,"It is not as fruitful as the previous part. And the story is also not great. But I can assure you for sure that it it's musical treat. It will not entertain you to the utmost extent, but it won't bore you either. It may disappoint you a little bit because the expectations were high. The climax was pretty decent. But at the same time let me tell you that it wasn't a grand ending. I have a doubt with the quality of the film. The script was not written well. It is worth watching but not one of the best. On the same note, it's at least better than some of this year's animation film which have not done well to impress us. It should well turn out to be the best animation film of the year. So, if you like light-heated animation comedy, you should go for the film."
75,Rio 2,8,25 July 2014,"Enjoyable to watch, and overall a satisfying sequel","I watched Rio and I liked it, but I thought the humans shouldn't have such a big role in a story about Blue Macaws. Rio 2 focused on the animals more and introduced some new ones such as Gabi the frog. It was nice to see Rio's original story have an epilogue, which led to another new adventure. It was entertaining to see Blu trying hard to get along with Jewel's family members. Also, this movie had more than one antagonist, which I think makes it more suspenseful for viewers to watch. This concept is growing and it shows in new movies. But what makes Rio 2 unique is its humor, which sets a nice overall mood for the movie. Not the best animation movie of 2014, but definitely worth watching."
76,Rio 2,8,16 July 2014,It's time to connect with the root.,"The first movie was a silent hit. One of the best animations on that year. Usually successful movies make comeback in sequels and I expected the 'Rio 2', but was not sure. 'Ice Age' series were the massive hit from the Blue Sky Studios. Other movies did not look like coming back in sequels. So 'Rio' gave them a chance to go on with a sequel. After this movie's success, now you can count on the 3rd as well. If it doesn't come then it will be a disappointment.Nowadays the animation industry is not targeting only the children, but adults as well. So the contents, including the story must benefit all age groups. This movie series were excellent, good story with messages in it. Especially this second movie talks about wildlife conservation like the movie 'Happy Feet'. Showing to the kids would be an educational. What a cute way to learn something valuable.Blu and Jewel with three kids enjoying the life. Jewel is an ideal mother who wants her kids to learn everything that birds can do naturally. But Blu who was once a human companion is not made for those. This is the issue wanted to be solved after all they are the last of their kind on the planet. One day they get a news that the explorer sighted a whole flock of blue macaw on the Amazon wilderness. Blu and Jewel decides to go and find them and let their kids to connect with their roots. So this adventure is our great entertainment. Lots of fun and even more than that. Just like in the 'Madagascar' movie, who discovers where they originally belong to.''Birds of blue feathers... Have to stick together.''The songs were really good and my favorite track is 'let's come together (beautiful creatures)'. Beautiful jungle beats, it is the latest addition to my free time listening list. There was nothing special in digital 3D, but definitely not bad. I saw the first movie in the regular version, but I enjoyed watching this in 3D. The story was not great, but humors were. The human characters were avoided until it gets into a crucial stage. The expansion of characters was exceptional. The original sidekicks from the first movie set aside to make their own fun which partially detached from mainstream story. The newer ones opened another dimension of the family and friend related drama, with happiness found and the jealousy kind of stuffs. Overall, a good animation, hard to leave behind unseen and not to suggest others. So if you like animations then don't listen to anybody, just go for it.7.5/10"
77,Rio 2,10,6 June 2014,The birds are back,"Rio is back after a three year wait.You will see how animation has grown after the 1990's with a load of misses like FernGully II.This time the birds must save the rain forest from humans.Inbetween we are having a lot of romance and fun like soccer with birds.There are dozens of small details to look out after too.Some of the songs might be big on the radio through this coming summer.The songs ranks from spoofs of classics to brand new tropical songs.So here is something for all.If you look away from the overused plots it's a colorful firework.Don't worry if you missed the movie in the Cinema because it will look striking on Blu Ray too, inserts pun.Here is another animated movie from this year that might fight for the Oscar, Annie and Golden Globes next Winter.10/10"
78,Rio 2,8,4 May 2014,Fun for Family,"This movie is really very colorful. Though to some extent it's less entertaining than the first one, it's definitely a watchable treat.It takes through a journey from a city to the beautiful amazon jungle. As usual it is so much colorful. They have worked hard on music as well.Specially, the kids are amazing. Why Watch: 1. Colorful backgrounds, it's Amazon and it's not a website, the Jungle ! 2 Songs and Dance, feels like dancing. 3 Story, Yeh it's about deforestation and it's impact. 4. Funny dialoguesWhy not - Not for a serious moviegoers1. It's a family, take your kids out and have fun !"
79,Rio 2,7,30 April 2014,What to Expect: Rio 2,"Why You Might Like It: I went to see this with my 2 year old and have to say he enjoyed it. He was a big fan of the original and so this one pretty much follows suit. Most of the major characters are back with the same actors doing their voices and there is some new characters as well. For parents, I do think that this happens to be an animated film that is able to be marginally entertaining for the adult audience. There are many parts of this that reminded me of a Meet the Parents with animated birds. The animation is very well done,the story keeps everyone engaged, and the music is spot on.Why You Might Not Like It: Much like the original, the movie has some political messages to get across that might bother some. It has a different storyline than the original, but is still fairly similar. If you are thinking of going to the theaters or taking your kids to the theaters to see it, then you might not feel like the product is worth the value of a movie ticket. It does run around 1 hour and 40 minutes, which might lose some kids attention. I am grasping at straws here, but I don't see a lot of reasons to not like this movie if you are going to see it for your kids sake.Acting/Casting: 8* Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 8*Plot/Characters: 7* Entertainment Value: 7* Total - 8+8+7+7 = 30/4 = 7.5"
80,Rio 2,7,29 April 2014,Visually Stunning,"First, let me say, I did NOT see Rio (1), so I didn't know what to expect. While I found the music forgettable, the colorful animation is splendid. The story is predictable, but should be a good message for children, if not adults. There are some comedic moments (the wrecking ball was especially funny) that are hilarious, but mostly I just enjoyed the animation. Despite it not being actual photography, it made me want to visit Rio and the Amazon!! My one gripe, and maybe it is in part due to the recent NBA flack, is that the bad guys/birds seem to have a ""black"" accent, while the good guys are ""white""--non-Hispanic even."
81,Rio 2,8,26 April 2014,Nothing beats Rio soundtrack!,"There are lots of really good parts on this Rio sequel, but one scene that really stood out is the part when Gabby, the pink tree frog sang a love song about Nigel. It was hilarious! Like I said, the music is wonderful! It really makes the movie livelier apart from the beautiful, bright colours they used. I strongly recommend this for younger viewers. It's funny, and they will surely enjoy it! I have two younger brothers, ages 6 and 4, and I can't remember a part of the movie where they didn't smile or laugh.I like the story. Even though it is quite simple  really targets the young viewers. But the writers got away with it with the wonderful music they added. My favourite character was Gabby. She was really cute and small and pink! I like her personality. How she stops at nothing to make her love, Nigel, love her as much as she loves him. You'll find out what happens to their love at the end of the movie! :DThe Jungle is incredible! You can't miss the extreme details on the trees and the intricate details on Blu and Jewel! The story is about a sighting of another blue macaw in the Amazon jungle. Of course, the only known blue macaw family in Rio De Janeiro will not just let this offer of finally finding other blue macaws in years pass by! Especially for the adventurous Jewel! So this is about the family traveling across Brazil to the Amazon, and then in the end, finding ""home"".This is suitable for all ages and contains very mild violence at the end. This will be a great movie if you just want to sit down and watch a decent movie. I strongly recommend this for younger viewers and up. It's funny and also heart-warming."
82,Rio 2,7,15 April 2014,"Impressive, One time watch","There's almost too much happening in Rio 2: apart from Blu's family troubles, the macaw tribe's haven in the jungle is under threat from a ruthless logging company.Powered by a loopy, irrepressible charm, Rio 2 dashes from scene to scene, but doesn't forget to pack in moments that range from affecting (Jewel's tender lullaby Don't Go Away) to absurd (Blu's GPS charting the route to Funky Town).Graphics/visual art: Okay, graphics are wonderful I say, I'm not watch it on 3d but still the colorful and wonderful arts of the colorful bird and the jungle was pretty enormous and beautiful to watch."
83,Rio 2,7,15 April 2014,"An entertaining sequel, full of laughs indeed","So the story picks up after the first movie, Blu and Jewel has already have three kids, yay!.... LOL. And after learning that there is still more of their kind, the family then goes to the Amazon jungle. Somewhere along the way Nigel, the evil cockatoo from the first movie caught sight of them and followed them, trying to get revenge. Blu and his crew finally reach Amazon, almost meeting Linda and Tulio, but they are taken away by the rest of the Blue Macaw hidden flock tribe. There Jewel meet her father.Nigel also reaches the location and decides to enter as an audition participant. Meanwhile, Tulio and Linda are then chased by illegal loggers. Accidentally while trying to impress Jewel, Blu ignites a ""war"", of bird soccer, between the Blue and Red Macaw tribe to control the grove they are in. Blu worsen things when he accidentally make an own goal, making the Blue Macaws lose the ""war"". But soon after, the loggers bulldoze the forest. But Blu convinced the rest of the tribe to fight back, and the rest of the jungle joins the fight against the loggers. Nigel, who have devised a plan to shoot a poisoned dart to Blu, ends up getting shot with that very dart. The jungle triumphs against the illegal loggers and turns out that the frog from whom the slime was taken to coat the dart is not poisonous.The movie is greatly entertaining, especially released after the dose of action and heroes. The jokes are stupidly super funny. As when the red bird tries to warn Tulio and Linda of the waterfall, and the bird is like ""ah whatever"". And also the ""Find Linda and Tulio"" that transforms into ""Searching for Dinner in Tokyo""The first appearance of Bruno Mars character is also stupidly funny, especially with Bruno's nice voice. The Amazon audition part is truly hilarious. In my opinion this part has the longest laughable funny sequence on a movie so far this year.As the movie is set in Brazil, the five time world soccer champion, it will be incomplete if the movie doesn't incorporate soccer in it. Rio 2 even incorporate almost everything the world knows about Brazil; the nature aspects of piranhas, anacondas, hand-sized tarantulas, colorful birds, and to the fact that there are irresponsible illegal loggers there.It is a movie aimed as a family entertainment. So, as expected, nobody is depicted to die in it, even the evil Nigel. but the scene of the fat anaconda near the ending is indeed quite creepy, especially for those who can grasp that far.There is more musical part here than the first installment, and they have more solo parts too. For me it's good on one side, but, if has a little more musical part, the movie will be boring. Particularly because it seems like the movie is designed to be focused more on the animation side rather than the musical side.From me, a 7 out of 10 score is deserving for this movie, and of course a recommendation to see it."
84,Rio 2,8,12 April 2014,Blu and Jewel take their kids  to the Amazon.,"Some sequels just don't live up to the original; but in this case, RIO 2 seems more colorful and a whole lot busier. Blu(Jesse Eisenberg)and Jewel(Anne Hathaway)have spent several years in Rio with their active three kids. Jewel tries to convince Blu that the children should enlighten their knowledge by traveling and they do get the chance. Blu's former owner and best friend Linda(Leslie Mann)and her ornithologist husband, Tulio(Rodrigo Santoro)are on expedition in the Amazon and discover Spix Macaws. Blu and family head to the Amazon to help in the search for the secret paradise home of the allusive macaws. When a flock is found in the jungle, Jewel meets her long lost father, Eduardo(Andy Garcia). Eduardo immediately is not too impressed with the domesticated Blu and tries to train him to fit in with the flock. When Blu tries to pick a Brazil nut for Jewel, by happenstance he flies into the territory of the Spix Macaw's arch enemy, the Scarlett Macaw. Now Blu finds himself in the middle of a war. This can only lead to more adventure in the jungle.The colorful animation and story is much better than the original. Some very funny situational comedy brings laughter to young and old. An all-star cast brings voice to likable characters; featured are: Jamie Foxx, Jemaine Clement, Bruno Mars, Kristin Chenoweth, Miguel Ferrer and George Lopez."
85,Rio 2,7,12 April 2014,Better than the original.,"Rio 2 is the usual formulated animated movie. Bad people and bad animals causing problems for the Parrots. A message about different personalities, and problem solving. Also, the real message is the saving of the environment for the parrots. Rio 2's strong parts are the humorous bad parrot/parrot cohorts. Pleasing to the animation and 3 d effects. The funny comic relief animals which create a fun look at the South American journey. The soccer match, and American idol scenes create an entertaining side stories which mix well with the main story line of conservation. There was more humour and less story with Rio 2 which made for a funnier movie than the original. My wife did not like how they portrayed Nigel the cockatoo. His feathers were all ratty and he could not fly. There was also a macaw in the movie that had a feather disorder and a balance problem probably PDD a parrot disease, which they were making fun of which upset my wife. 7 squawks out of 10."
86,Rio 2,8,10 April 2014,They're back into the amazon...,"Storyline/plot: The story continues the event from Rio 1 where Blu and jewel already have 3 kids just like the trailer. The old enemies also back, yes he's Nigel, but this time he's with the toxic frog taking revenge on Blu. The stories set on the amazon forest where Tulio and Linda discovered there's blue macaw beside Blu and jewel. Jewel reunited with her father again and Blu meet with her father in law. There is many jokes/funny scenes will be founded in here just like Rio 1, there's also pretty much more sad part in Rio 2 than Rio 1, the ending was pretty awesome I say, also some moral from this movie can be told.Graphics/visual art: Okay, graphics are wonderful I say, I'm not watch it on 3d but still the colorful and wonderful arts of the colorful bird and the jungle was pretty enormous and beautiful to watch. This time, they're taking place on the amazon forest which is pretty beautiful than in the city I say...Music/soundtrack: Well, From Rio 1 I have 2 favorite soundtrack and now on Rio 2 I have 4 favorite soundtrack. Will I am, Jamie fox and Bruno Mars will make the movies soundtrack fitted. Because it's set on the amazon forest, the nature sfx makes the movie more atmospheric.."
87,Rio 2,3,14 October 2014,The movie sucks; just like the first one does.,"'RIO 2': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2011 hit animated kids movie 'RIO'; about two blue macaws who fall in love, in Rio de Janiero, despite their many differences. They now have three kids (in this film) and their family travels to the Amazon, in order to meet up with other rare blue macaws there. It was directed by Carlos Saldanha and written by Don Rhymer, Carlos Kotkin, Jenny Bicks, Yoni Brenner and Saldanha. Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Leslie Mann, Rodrigo Santoro, Jemaine Clement, George Lopez, Jamie Foxx, will.i.am and Tracy Morgan all return as voice actors. They're joined this time around by Kristin Chenoweth, Miguel Ferrer, Andy Garcia and many others. Despite all of the talent involved, the movie sucks; just like the first one does.Blu (Eisenberg) and Jewel (Hathaway) are happily living in Rio together, with their three children, as the story begins. Linda Gunderson (Mann), Blu's old owner, is on an expedition in the Amazon, with her ornithologist husband, Tulio (Santoro), when they discover that other blue macaws are living there. Blu and Jewel hear about it, over the news, and decide to journey to the Amazon to help find the other birds (since they're family). Once there they must battle evil loggers and their old nemesis Nigel (Clement), the cockatoo from the first film.The film is beautifully animated and the voice actors do a good job playing their characters (but not much is required of them). I can see how the movie could be somewhat funny, and amusing, to kids but only really young ones. It's mostly full of just silly childish humor, with nothing of any value to offer anyone (other than the simplest forms of entertainment, for children). I didn't like the first movie either though; so if you enjoyed it you might like this sequel too.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpJHaK5PsZc"
88,Rio 2,5,8 July 2014,Jokes fall flat but musical numbers pop.,"Full of energy and swirling colours, yet narratively plodding and largely devoid of humour, this follow up adventure for Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) is a harmless misfire. The musical numbers, overseen by Sergio Mendes, are concocted with gusto, whilst the animation is vivid and sharp, but rather than augmenting the story as they did last time around, these elements are relied upon to do all of the heavy lifting here. The characters are all the same too: Blu is still a comfort-freak, Jewel is still adventurous, Pedro (Will.I.Am) and Nico (Jamie Foxx) are still bopping and popping, Linda (Leslie Mann) and Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) are still oddball humans obsessed with birds, Luiz (Tracy Morgan) is still a slobbering dog and Nigel (Jermaine Clement) is still an evil cockatoo who unequivocally steals the show every second he is on screen. Most disappointingly, this sequel is  aside from when Nigel performs ""I Will Survive""  a laugh-free affair that rarely tries for anything new, instead mistakenly thinking that rehashed jokes from the first outing will hit the spot again. There's enough enthusiasm in all of the singin' and dancin' to keep this afloat, just, however there is a discouraging repetitiveness setting in after only two instalments that doesn't bode well for this bright-feathered series."
89,Rio 2,8,4 May 2014,"After seeing RIO 2, your kids may expect their McNuggets . . .",". . . to Gurgitate back up shortly, singing a Happy Meal song. In the world of RIO 2, singing animals are swallowed by predators and they JUST KEEP ON SINGING! A day or two later they pop out of the predator's mouth fully intact, still warbling without missing a beat, no worse for wear. This is NOT a ""Disney Nature"" adventure, or anything close to the grim realism of a Disney cartoon. If the RIO 2 people had made BAMBI, Thumper never would have been tasked with consoling the title character over parental loss issues. Now that there's a TV show called THE VIEW to make sure that fewer and fewer kids get vaccinated, real life will become increasingly tough compared to that of the kids who grew up in the late 1900s. With continuous plagues of chick pox, mumps, measles, whooping cough, and polio already stalking contemporary American youngsters, they know that diphtheria and cholera cannot be far behind. Therefore, why not cheer up our little ones with feel-good fluff such as RIO 2, rather than expose them to the woeful World of Disney?"
90,Rio 2,9,3 May 2014,Exciting and entertaining,"Although most people would agree that nothing beats the original movie, I believe that Rio 2 was just as funny and entertaining as the first one, if not more. The movie has just enough conflict and drama in it to be exciting. The humor that was included in the movie was amusing and funny for all ages. The thing that stuck out the most was the musical factor. Compared to the original, this one was spectacular. Even with all of the humor and music the movie was still able to have a recognizable moral. Rio 2 should be considered a classic family movie enjoyed by all ages. I highly recommend this movie especially if you were a fan of the original."
91,Rio 2,1,23 August 2014,O Lover!!!!,"Typical liberal crap! Teach children how horrible Republicans are as they want to kill people. . . .Anyone that liked this movie definitely voted for the dictator Obama and has been brainwashed by the liberal media . . . Facts are Facts!!! DEAL WITH IT!!! Those awful lumberjacks are horrible and want to kill tree huggers. . . . Come on . . . That really sucks. After 50 years of being pumped full of liberalism. . . on influential amount of the population in this country had fallen victim to this Garbage. I truly feel sorry for the veterans that defended our previously great country as it was something to be proud of. Now you have to be tolerant of everything except the constitution. If you believe in the constitution, you are a racist, homophobes, or what ever horrible adjective the liberals can think of. Movie a disgrace to the once great USA ! ! ! !"
92,Rio 2,5,27 June 2014,Rio 2,"Another animated movie based on another species of animal, why? because they can and its another easy money maker. I'm waiting for an animated movie based on dung beetles and elephants...why? I dunno, they haven't milked them yet so game on, we're clearly gonna get an animated movie about every flippin creature on Earth eventually.So the first film was set in Rio and I'm guessing this film will move into the rain forest? did you see that coming? So I'm guessing as the film is set deep within the Amazonian rain forest the plot will cover the destruction of the rain forest and Blu and co becoming naturalised to jungle life...see that coming? Is any of this film even remotely original in any sense? does it even try?! the answer is no, this is merely the same formulaic albeit gorgeous looking CGI flick we've now seen about a thousand times.So the film is a formulaic cookie cutter production and like other identical films there are a few positive things I can mention. Firstly the visuals are of course sumptuous, I mean really bright bold glossy colourful and extremely well animated. This is naturally no real surprise as these days CGI movies have reached a point where the skills and computer technology are in their prime, you expect them to look stunning, you know they will, its so routine that you could actually argue that people don't even notice the visuals anymore.The other thing I like about these films is how they manage to highlight typical traits of the particular species in question, both behavioural and environmentally. This normally covers obvious things we all know about the specific species and their habitat, common knowledge, but also little winks or tit bits that maybe someone with that extra bit of animal knowledge might spot...which is cool. This normally also covers the various other creatures in the film too, for example the dart frog character being pointed out as not actually poisonous and spotting the various tropical birds hidden throughout the foliage.In all honesty though apart from that most of this film is the same spiel all over again. You have all the same characters from the nerdy yet plucky hero who is utterly useless, the lively kids, the sidekicks voiced by various famous people, usually a rap star of some kind, to the stereotypically British voiced bad guy who sounds like Tim Curry and his own silly sidekick. Yeah sure there are some reasonable visual gags here and there but really the entire film hinges on the likable dastardly vocal performance of Jemaine Clement, everything else is dull. So cliché that Eduardo the gruff father has a buzz cut style tuft on his head, is this Macaw from the 50's USA?I must also be negative about the use of way too many song sequences, is it possible a new animated film can actually make it through its run time without one dreadful rap/hip-hop tune? no apparently not. It seems either Hollywood or kids these days love this stuff because every CGI animated flick seems to have some hip-hop or rap in it which instantly destroys any self respect or quality the film was aiming for in my opinion. Add to this the now statutory inclusion of rap/hip-hop/pop stars for voice work too, plenty of folk out there but yeah sure, lets use some bland untalented popstars just to lure in more kids.I still don't get how this particular universe is suppose to even work, they are real birds and squawk or chirp when communicating with humans. They live like birds, eat like birds...do everything like real birds...yet Blu owns his own tiny GPS, electric toothbrush and various other tiny items that seem to have been made...for birds? Yeah I know I'm being extremely picky over a silly kids movie but I just couldn't help but think to myself...where would Blu possibly get this stuff from?? Quite liked how the word 'pet' is a dirty word for the birds though. Business as usual then, wash rinse and repeat formula, safe but sorry, if it ain't broke?...or was it maybe broke from the start?? *raise eyebrow*. The finale is daft and kinda spoils what little the film had going for itself, its not like the film even mocks itself, it takes itself relatively seriously in terms of the adventure. Grandiose in the eye candy department, wetter than mackerels bumhole, friendlier than a very friendly fat handlebar moustached German in tight leather lederhosen, ecologically sound (and shoved down your throat) and with more cutesy critters than you can wave your gun at. Its the same as everything else but its about birds...and its a sequel.5.5/10"
93,Rio 2,4,9 July 2014,The Vidiot Reviews,"Rio 2Rio 2? Isn't that the colloquial term for the shantytown where they hid Rio's impoverished children during the World Cup?My mistake, it actually refers to the continuation of a story, not a cover-up.Married macaws Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) have started a family in suburbia.Domesticated and docile, Jewel feels the family needs to return to their roots, so she proposes a trip to the Amazon.In the tropics they encounter old friends (Jamie Foxx, Tracy Morgan, George Lopez) and new enemies in the form of illegal loggers.A perfunctory sequel, Rio 2 doesn't deviate from its mediocre origins or up the ante in any aspect. Sprinkled with forgettable ditties like the first, the Sérgio Mendes produced soundtrack annoys more than entertains. The same applies to the overworked characters.Incidentally, we need to chop down rainforests so we can make newspapers for macaws to crap on. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
94,Rio 2,6,12 April 2014,"Colorful and gorgeous animation, but not much more to it","""We are not people, we're birds. We have to get out into the wild and be birds.""Director Carlos Saldanha takes us back to the colorful world of Rio in this sequel that takes place mostly in the Amazon jungle. I enjoyed the first film for the animation and how beautiful they made it look. Rio 2 is probably my least favorite animated film of 2014 so far, but I still have to give it a pass for the gorgeous animation. The film looks beautiful, it's a shame that the characters aren't as well developed. I wasn't a huge fan of the plot either, but the animation is so breathtaking that it is worth it. Adults might not have as much fun because it isn't as smart or witty as other recent animated films, but kids will enjoy this for the colorful characters. Of course like in most sequels you have to try to outdo yourself, more characters are introduced and ultimately the film just felt too crowded and the subplots and new characters didn't work very well. They kind of took me out of the movie, but the Amazon jungle is so gorgeously captured that I still had a decent time with this. I'm giving this a mild recommendation, but there isn't much more to this sequel other than that. As for the plot, the film continues to center on the surviving blue macaws that are living in a special reserve in the city of Rio. Believed to be the only surviving birds of their species Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) have formed a family of their own and have three kids. Things take an unexpected turn for them when they discover that there might be more macaws in the heart of the Amazon jungle. They decide to travel to the wild jungle to meet up with the rest of their kind. They are not alone on their journey however, as Nigel (Jermaine Clement) is waiting for the perfect moment to have his revenge along with his new sidekick, a venomous frog named Linda (Leslie Mann). Once they arrive they are surprised to discover that among the surviving birds there's Jewel's father, Eduardo (Andy Garcia), who is happy to have found Jewel again. However, Blu has trouble adopting to the lifestyle of the wild and his father in law doesn't seem to take a huge liking of his city ways. The sequel has some funny moments and I chuckled a few times, but the plot was weak and predictable. It felt a bit long and dragged at times. It also felt too preachy with all the ecological messages and I could have done without those subplots with the humans tearing down the trees. Most of the characters are back from the first film and a lot of new ones were added although I really didn't care much for any of them. There are some fun musical moments that helped me get past the more tedious moments but overall I didn't have such a good time as I did with The LEGO Movie or Mr. Peabody & Sherman. The film is not even as close in terms of being witty, but it does look more beautiful and kids might enjoy it more for all the colorful scenes and the choreographed musical numbers. By the end of the film I kind of felt tired and exhausted, but the kids seemed to have enjoyed it."
95,Rio 2,6,8 April 2014,"Don't go looking for 'Rio' in the Amazon - despite similar striking visuals, this Amazon-set sequel suffers from a distinct lack of story, character, humour and poignancy","Coming off a snappy and clever original, this sequel which is once again helmed by Brazilian director Carlos Saldanha and voiced by pretty much the same cast members feels lazy and perfunctory by comparison. In place of the playful vivaciousness of 2011's surprise hit is a frenetic hodgepodge of carefully engineered sequences that aim to be family sitcom one minute, a ""fish out of water"" premise the next, an environmental primer the next, and even an avian-based episode of ""American Idol"".The excuse for the overcrowded story is the discovery by Blu's (Jesse Eisenberg) human keepers Tulio and Linda (Rodrigo Santoro and Leslie Mann) during an expedition into the Amazon rainforest that the blue macaws might not be quite so endangered as they had originally feared. That is enough for Jewel (Anne Hathaway) to convince Blu to take their brood of three on an expedition to meet their long-lost ancestors, despite the latter Minnesota-raised macaw's continued reliance on manmade gadgets stuffed into his fanny pack, including an all-purpose multi-tool and GPS navigation.Returning to join in the fun deep in the heart of the jungle are Blu's pals - the party-hearty toucan Rafael (George Lopez) and his sidekicks, Nico (Jamie Foxx) and Pedro (the Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am) - but this time, they have to contend for attention with Jewel's long-lost family, led by her proud authoritarian father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) and former childhood playmate Roberto (Bruno Mars). Further adding to the character clutter is Blu's former nemesis Nigel (Jemaine Clement), whose quest for vengeance finds company in the form of an adoring protégé - the poisonous frog Gabi (Kristin Chenoweth).Oh and did we mention that there is also a group of illegal loggers who are desperate to keep all human attention out of the patch of forest? As you've probably guessed, that's just yet another one of many plot strands in the crowded yet underdeveloped script by the quartet of Don Rhymer (who passed away in 2012), Carlos Kotkin, Jenny Bicks and Yoni Brenner. Whereas the original bothered with wit and invention, the writers here seem to have adopted a 'go-for-broke' attitude, which explains why there are half-hearted musical interludes amidst a ""Meet the Parents"" equivalent that frankly reveal a hackneyed and insincere narrative.The occasional puns aside, Saldanha compensates for the lack of any real sense of character and story by keeping things busy and hectic throughout. Making full use of the jungle backdrop, Saldanha ups the ante on the visual imagery, whether is it the plentiful song-and-dance numbers or the raucous action sequences. Aided once again by Sergio Mendes' presence as executive music producer, the former pop off the screen especially in a showcase of the macaws' synchronized flying routines set to Brazilian body-percussion group Barbatuques' 'Beautiful Creatures', as well as in a Carnaval-styled procession in the Amazon right at the end.But despite the striking colourful aesthetic and the carnival-like atmosphere complete with plenty of samba and bossa nova music, older audiences will find themselves struggling to make it through even a relatively modest running time. Indeed, the diversions may work for the kids, but there is something scattershot about the entire enterprise that is hard to ignore, in particular coming off an extremely good year in animation with Disney's instant modern classic 'Frozen' and Warner Bros' 'The Lego Movie'. There is little to hook our imagination nor our attention once you look past the vivid scenery, and even less poignancy this time round with Blu pretty much left out in the blue no thanks to an overstuffed story.On their part, the voice actors do their darnest best with each and every one of their respective roles - though the scene-stealer here is Clement, whose interactions with Chenoweth as his poison-frog sidekick are probably the most entertaining parts of the movie. But the chuckles come fewer and further in between than in the first outing to 'Rio', and despite being just as bright and cheerful on the outside, there is too little story, too many characters and too few decent gags to warrant this trip to the Amazon. You can take the birds out of Rio, but as much as the filmmakers have tried, there's no transplanting Rio into the Amazon, which probably explains why this incongruently titled sequel possesses few of what made its predecessor such a crowd-pleasing delight."
96,Rio 2,10,18 December 2014,Excellent Sequel,"This was my favorite out of the Rio franchise. I loved the first one, but loved this one even more. OK, first off, here are my thoughts on this delightful movie. It's just as good as the first one, so if you're a fan of Rio, then Rio 2 is perfect for you. From the very beginning of the movie, you can tell this is a Rio movie, and I enjoyed every minute of it.Another great thing about this movie is that it added a little light to Jewel's past. We all know that Jewel was separated from her parent in the first movie, but this, actually explained how it happened. Jewel is among my favorite characters, and I loved how it shedded some light on her past. If you're hoping for Blu's past to be revealed, then you're be disappointed, nothing was ever said about his past, just Jewel's. This movie is more focused on her being reunited with her family and Blu struggling to fit in.Another thing I loved about this is the music... The songs they sang are very good. Once I saw this, I got the soundtrack and couldn't stop listening to it, it was that good. The score to the movie is also good. It is another excellent soundtrack composed by John Powell, the original composer of Rio. If you're familiar with his work, then you will know his excellent score to Rio.Another thing you need to know, everyone is back from the first Rio. Jamie Foxx, Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, and many of the original cast returned for this and that makes this even more enjoyable. The new cast members are also enjoyable, including the excellent Andy Garcia. He is perfect for the role of Eduardo, but let's not forget the lovable Bruno Mars as Roberto. I was not familiar with him until I saw this and I now enjoy his music. For this being his first movie, Bruno Mars did an outstanding job as Roberto. He brought that character to life and added to the drama that was in the movie, with Blu thinking Roberto was going to steal Jewel away.The storyline was good, but like I said before, not much was said about Blu's past. We know how Jewel was separated from her family, but what I don't understand is why nothing was said about Blu's past. He had to have family like Jewel. Where are his parents? This may be a hint that Saldanha is going to focus Rio 3 on Blu and I hope he does. The loving moments between Blu and Jewel made me smile, and it's cute to see some love in movies like this. My favorite part was when Jewel laid her head on Blu and fell asleep in his wings, that was an great way to show Jewel's love for Blu.Saldanha, if you're reading this, you should be proud of this movie. You made another great movie and continue the great work. I hope you make Rio 3 and hope you continue the greatness like you did with this. This was by far your best work. So, if you are a love of animated movies, I suggest watching Rio 2. It's a lovable movie and one of the best sequels of 2014. This may not be an all time animated classic, but it is one of the best movies yet. If you move past the flaws in this, then you can enjoy this movie. Every movie will has flaws here and there, but the thing that makes a difference is to accept them and enjoy the movie. The only problems I did see in this movie is the leaving Blu's past unanswered. Like I said, this may be Saldanha's hint that Rio 3 might focus on Blu and his past, but it's all up to him.In the end, I give this movie 10 stars out of 10, I really enjoyed this movie and saw this three times in theaters. The 3D is worth the trip and if you enjoy 3D, then see this in 3D."
97,Rio 2,6,13 August 2014,Bright colorful for the kids only,"Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) have three kids now Carla, Bia, and Tiago. Jewel is dismayed that Blu is passing his domesticated ways onto the kids. Linda and Tulio are traveling deep in the Amazon and discover a blue feather. Blu and Jewel are amazed that they may not be the only Spix's macaw left and the family goes off to find their flock. Rafael, Nico and Pedro follows along on the expedition. The group is spotted by Nigel who has been rendered flightless since the first movie. There is also logger Big Boss who wants to protect his illegal operation from being discovered by Linda and Tulio.This is bright. This is loud. This is colorful. This is great for the kids. Sadly there is nothing for the adults. The story isn't very imaginative. There are no jokes for anybody with an adult sense of humor. This is mostly a kids' movie. The soccer is lots of fun and the final battle is actually exciting. Other than that, the story is quite bland."
98,Rio 2,4,1 August 2014,I didn't care for it...but I was not the target audience.,"Sometimes animated movies, even in this era of family-oriented movies, are geared exclusively for kidsand that's not necessarily a bad thing because it allows parents the time to escape to the other room and think about how they're going to break their upcoming divorce to the little ones. While it's never actually stated flat-out, ""Rio 2"" definitely seems like one of those movies that is just for kids.Overall, the movie is just a colorful romp filled with predictable slapstick humor and a leading actor who probably isn't the best choice. The movie crams in too many characters and too many points of conflict that they can't balance out in the film's running time but I really thought Bruno Mars was great in his role and, like the last film, Jemaine Clement is fantastic as Nigel and his performance actually made me laugh quite a bit.In the end, I wasn't the intended audience for ""Rio 2"" and, taking that into consideration, the movie works well for the younger viewers. For me, though, it was just another forgettable animated movie.Greetings! Feel like reading more of my rants, ramblings, geek references, bad jokes and other movie reviews (like a more in-depth look at ""Rio 2"" and other films that are better off because there's no Jesse Eisenberg in it)? If you do, you can head on over to my blog; revronmovies.blogspot.com. If you don't, that's okay, too. I still think you're alright!"
99,Rio 2,5,27 May 2014,lets all sing like the birdies sing,"The thing I most enjoyed was the silly humor. In some movies of this genre the humor can upset the whole continuity of the film. But not here. The ruffled feathers and facial expressions endeared them to me. The entertainment doesn't stop there.......the rendition of the song "" I will survive"" was a high point, And the use of the swiss army knife to aid the In cutting down Brazil nuts to use as a ball in sports was priceless. The animation is done well but am still wondering if the frog wasn't a gummy edible substance. Over all I thought it rather intriguing the great use of touching on the theme of the Amazonian jungle and rainbow forestry were a great way to bring some info to people of all ages ,of these beautiful and timeless works of nature. A fun and inspiring experience anyone could enjoy,"
100,Rio 2,6,26 May 2014,Carnival of feathers with an eco heart,"Rio 2 is the latest in a long line of superbly produced computer generated animated films. The animation is, as now is expected, top drawer and the amount of moving characters or plants they can get in one shot is amazing. Standard story about the little people standing up against bad Mr Big, with a strong 'save the forests eco message'. The highlight scene being where the audience is taken from the vibrant forest into a large area being cleared by massive machines.Rather like Happy Feet the film is punctuated with big production song and dance numbers. Though it doesn't maintain momentum throughout in the end this is a charming feel good film. It even includes the Romeo and Juliet death/suicide scene and other bits of Shakespeare."
