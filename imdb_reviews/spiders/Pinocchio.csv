0,Pinocchio,10,17 February 2001,Wonderful,"Last night I watched Pinocchio, Disney's second feature-length film and in my opinion one of the studio's best features. Based on the 19th century book by Carlo Collodi, but not half as unpleasant, Pinocchio combines winning animation with great humor and excitement. There are songs, but they're never like the huge production numbers that last four minutes and feature the voice of some up-and-coming princess of pop (who'll be gone in a year) that the studio later adopted with the applicable exception of When you Wish Upon a Star. My favorite song is ""Little Wooden Head"" which is featured in the beginning and is a truly wonderful scene as Gepetto and Figaro play happily with the new puppet.The movie takes a sadistic, cruel, heartless little wooden boy (Collodi's character) and turns him into an interesting, 3-dimensional kid with a good heart but who is weak-willed and doesn't always listen to reason. The animation makes brilliant use of the multiplane camera, featuring a sprawling opening sequence in which the viewer practically sees the entire village at night. The characters are colorful and fun (I especially love Honest John Foulfellow and his sidekick Gideon) and the story has never a dull moment. This film is a reminder of the sort of efforts Disney put int o their films; the man himself had a great storytelling passion that was lost in later works (Alice in Wonderland, 101 Dalmatians). Pinocchio was never as famous as some of the others, and this is unfortunate because it is his masterpiece."
1,Pinocchio,10,16 August 2000,"When ""Pinocchio"" came out it was suddenly apparent that ""Snow White"" had been a mere ranging shot.","There are a hundred great things about ""Pinocchio"".  Pleasure Island, for one.  I'm amazed how quick the Disney artists were to discover that the multiplane camera, as well as providing accurate perspective and spectacular landscape shots, could be used more subtly to suggest sinister murk.  (We get a similar effect in ""Fantasia"" in the first half of ""The Rite of Spring"".)  And Lampwick's transformation into a donkey is a disturbing moment, for many reasons ... today they might have made the mistake of using flashy computer morphing, which would have been a mistake: expert animation and cutting gives us the distinct impression - almost all done with shadows - that there is a donkey BREAKING THROUGH from inside; which, in his case, is metaphorically accurate.  (Probably the reason Pinocchio survives us that he is as free from native vice as from native virtue.  He must LEARN to adopt the mind-set of Pleasure Island.  This takes time: time enough for him to escape.)But there's much, much more: clever use of songs (note the obvious, but none the less effective, irony of ""I've Got No Strings""); daring use of stark WHITE backgrounds as well dense crowded ones; an intelligent, mythic story; a wonderful dash of humanity in the form of a cricket; a good musical score; rich atmosphere.  The last is hard to describe.  Of all Disney's films this one has the most pronounced Old World feeling, yet it doesn't seem to take place anywhere in particular - not even in Italy.  Nor does it seem to take place in any particular era.  I fear that no modern film could be so imprecisely evocative; the artistic innocence in which ""Pinocchio"" was forged may be lost forever."
2,Pinocchio,,14 July 2001,Disney's earliest masterpiece...the art of animation never finer...,"Darker in tone than most Disney animated features (except for 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'), 'Pinocchio' came shortly after 'Snow White' and showed marked improvement in the art of animation technology to produce startling special effects.The first twenty-five minutes alone raise the film to the level of true animation art. Gepetto's inventive clocks come to life as realistically as any real-life photography could do. The warmth and cosiness of his dwelling and the charming shenanigans of Figaro the kitten and Cleo the goldfish, are all perfectly realized. The imaginative use of music and animation art is never finer than in these opening scenes.Afterwards, as the plot thickens, the special effects are just as impressive. The scene of Gepetto searching for Pinocchio with a lantern on a rainy night after he has been captured by Stromboli is unforgettable imagery. The wagon lurching along roads with Pinocchio in a cage is a frightening thing. Even darker are the adventures that await Pinocchio when he reaches Pleasure Island. The scene of the boys turning into donkeys is probably one of the most awesome and frightening moments in the film.Altogether charming are the underwater sequences before the meeting of Monstro the Whale. The climactic chase after the escape from the belly of the whale is handled brilliantly. The music perfectly accents the dramatic chase for this sequence and the songs throughout are in keeping with the mood and characters of the story. It is the sharp contrast between the lighter moments and the darker ones that gives the film a correct blend of fantasy and horror.Parents should be cautioned that very young children may be frightened. Has to be considered one of the most beautifully animated Disney features of all time. A treasure to see again and again."
3,Pinocchio,8,5 July 2006,Tough To Beat These First Disney Efforts,"When I - and I assume, most people - think of Pinocchio, we think of his nose growing longer when he tells a lie. Yet, that is only one scene in this movie - the first one ever done on this famous fictional character, I believe.This is strictly a fantasy-adventure story, not a parable or a full story about lying, although that obviously is one of the messages. There are several moral messages in here, so it's a worthwhile story for kids to see.Sometimes I think these totally-innocent first few Disney efforts (Bambi, Fantasia) are still better than all the stuff they have put out since.The colorful scenes are another attraction. particularly in the beginning in the old man's house with all the fancy clocks and toys. That part is better than much of the adventure story, as it turns out. The story lags a bit in the middle and then picks up with a rousing finish with a big whale. Overall, I enjoyed ""Jiminy Cricket"" the best and also appreciated that they didn't overdo the songs in here: short and sweet, and not that many. They don't make 'em (normally) like they used to!!"
4,Pinocchio,9,9 March 2000,One of Disney`s finest movies,"Pinocchio is a true classic in the world of movies. Pinocchio is based on the Italian story about the puppet who became a real boy. Pinocchio is one of Disney`s finest and it beats all the new ultracommercial cartoons, which the company produces nowadays. The story is good, the characters are very likable and warmhearted, and the music is sheer perfection.  These old Disney classics are cartoons that are suitable for the WHOLE family, not just the small kids. Watch it, and prepare to be stunned! 9/10"
5,Pinocchio,,2 July 2004,sweet and funny Disney classic,"'Pinocchio' benefits from one of the finest collection of songs to grace a Disney cartoon; from 'I Got No Strings', to 'An Actor's Life For Me', and (best of all) 'When You Wish Upon A Star' - brilliant sung by 'Ukelele Ike' Edwards as Jiminy Cricket.This cute adaptation from Carlo Corolli's classic novel adds pets with the 'aw' factor (cat and fish), as well as a truly scary sequence involving donkeys.  The characters are all memorable and Pinocchio is convincing in his move from a wooden puppet to a real boy, even in cartoon form.  Good voice talent from Evelyn Venable as the Blue Fairy too, especially in the bits where Pinocchio can't help revealing he isn't telling the truth!Short, sweet, funny, and involving, 'Pinocchio' is worth an hour of anybody's time, young or old."
6,Pinocchio,9,16 August 2009,"""I've Got No Strings""","For it's second full length animated feature, Walt Disney Studios picked the Carlo Collodi children's classic Pinocchio. The wooden puppet boy who turns into flesh and blood because of a heroic deed has been done a few times on screen, but the Disney version remains the standard.In some of the animated features of recent years we've come full circle in the fact that a lot of well known Hollywood figures have sought to lend their voices to animated productions. Coming to mind immediately are Mel Gibson as Captain John Smith and Eddie Murphy as the donkey in the Shrek movies. It wasn't as chic a thing to do back in Disney's day, still Walt came up with several good ones like young Dickie Jones as Pinocchio, Walter Catlett as J. Worthington Foulfellow, Frankie Darro as Lampwick, and most important Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket.These folks lend their voices to one of Disney's best musical scores with Catlett making immortal the thespians ballad An Actor's Life For Me, Jones celebrating the fact he's been liberated from all manner of restraint with I've Got No Strings and Cliff Edwards talking about his new responsibilities as the puppet boy's conscience in Give A Little Whistle.Most important though is the Academy Award given to that most plaintive song of yearning When You Wish Upon A Star as introduced by Cliff Edwards. Edwards was a major performer in the Twenties and early Thirties with his ukulele Ike character and introduced many popular songs like It's Only A Paper Moon and Singing In The Rain. But he had come up on hard times with a lot of substance abuse problems when Walt Disney offered him the part of Jiminy Cricket's voice. The movie Pinocchio and the songs he sang there resurrected his career and even when down and out, Edwards could always get work at the Disney Studio because of Jiminy Cricket's enduring popularity.Animation never really dates and the best animation in the world was pioneered at Disney Studio. People can see Pinocchio on the same bill as Shrek even today and I daresay the audience would be equally responsive.And you can appreciate Pinocchio today as much as your grandparents and great grandparents did through the magic of YouTube or Amazon. If not wish upon a star and fate will step in and see you through."
7,Pinocchio,10,3 March 2008,Disney's Dark Masterpiece,"This is the best animated Disney movie I have eve seen, and I have seen most of them. It's so different from all the other ones, as the bad guy not only lives, he also wins. The Coachman is probably one of the most evil villains Disney has ever produced; he turns kids into asses and makes them do hard labor for the rest of their lives...and he gets away with it. Although the ending is happy, there's still bitterness to it because every bad guy gets away, including Stromboli who is evil because of his greed, as with the two foxes who ""befriend"" Pinocchio. Supposedly the book is darker than the movie, but this movie is as dark as it needs to be.The music is memorable, featuring the classic ""When You Wish Upon a Star,"" which is the only song that seems to be normal for a Disney movie. It does have other musical numbers, but they all seem to have a dark undertone to them. The animation itself is brilliant, especially for 1941; I've always loved the clock sequence. I only wish that animated movies would get back to drawing animation instead of the new cgi crap; it may take longer, but it looks so much better. It's pretty sad when a movie from 1941 looks better than current ones.This is the only Disney movie I gave a 10/10."
8,Pinocchio,10,1 July 2007,Disney's greatest star,"The 2nd animated Disney classic is Disney's finest movie ever. A favorite of mine and a very dear film to me. It is an improvement over ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and more captivating.""Pinocchio"" is a masterpiece. It is so good that I can't find any faults in. Perfection is notorious in every way: the excellent artwork, palette colors and attention to detail. All of them obey to very high standards. Everything is so well drawn and painted with heart and soul: the sceneries, the characters, the backgrounds, the wonderful details...Although the atmosphere is quite dark and creepy in some parts, most of the time it is a sweet movie that is also great fun, entertaining, heartwarming and magical. Animation and soundtrack are superb as well. I just love all those songs. The movie is also a full plate when it comes to classic humor, thanks to many funny moments and hilarious lines.Being an Italian tale, it takes place in Italy. To be more specific, in a nice village interestingly named Collodi - nothing less than the name of the book's author, Carlo Collodi.This movie also had the honor of being a pioneer in camera use: just notice that nice close-up of a church and how the camera goes straight to the heart of the village.This is a timeless classic. No question about that. In fact, it stands the test of time so well that it's difficult to believe this movie is from the year 1940 because it doesn't look any dated. No, sir! It always looks fresh and modern.Fabulous voice performances is another thing this film doesn't lack. All of them terrific: Dickie Jones, Christian Rub, Cliff Edwards, Charles Judels, Walter Catlett, Evelyn Venable and even some brilliant ones in the art of making sounds like Mel Blanc and Marion Darlington...As for the characters, they're also part of the movie's appeal. Cleo and Figaro are such cute and adorable creatures. Who wouldn't want to have a gold fish and a kitten like that? Geppetto, the kind woodcarver, is so distracted that he's hilarious. Pinocchio is cute, innocent and lovable like a human child, although stubborn and prone to temptation at times. Jiminy Cricket is humorous and cool, but a bit impatient sometimes.Stromboli is hysterical and explosive. His nasty temper makes him so funny, especially whenever he mouths off in Italian! The Blue Fairy has got to be one of the kindest and most beautiful Disney ladies ever. She's so pretty! The coachman looks harmless, but behind his kind looks he's corrupt and a demon.Honest John and Giddy are a perfect comic relief. Giddy is a cat and a funny mute character (like Dopey). Honest John is the epitome of the sly fox: not *really* evil, but clever, hilarious, charming, shameless, unscrupulous and greedy. Ironically, despite his aristocratic manners, he is incapable of hiding a certain rudeness and lack of culture. For example, he can't spell the name ""Pinocchio"" correctly. Honest John's real name is never mentioned in the movie: J. Worthington Foulfellow, likely the strangest name I ever heard.Monstro, the enormous sperm whale, is one of the most impressive animated beasts of all time.This should definitely be on Top 250."
9,Pinocchio,,25 July 2004,Important things that we living for a human,"Pinocchio is my favorite movie since I was a child. We can learn many important things that we living for a human from this movie. For example, we donft tell a lie, we don't escape toward an easy thing and what we have courage and so on. I'll never forget the goddess of star say One lie leads to another, and you don't cover the lie in the end. I felt that I don't wont to tell a lie in my childhood. My favorite scene is the scene where Pinocchio go help his father Gepetto in the sea. I think that it is brave of him to fight with a monster whale because he helps his father. And I was impressed with cricket of Pinocchio's conscience. He always helps Pinocchio and lead Pinocchio for good way. It is superb what the goddess of star is always watching Pinocchio in the night sky too. I rated this movie at 9/10."
10,Pinocchio,10,21 November 2007,The most enchanting and magical of all the Disney films.,"For seventy years, people of all demographics have been entertained and enchanted by the animated features brought out by the Disney studios. In an era when most animated films lack imagination and spirit, it's always nice to watch an earlier Disney film, whether it be one of their old classics or the works released during the early 90's renaissance. Most film historians claim that Snow White and Fantasia are the best films to come out of the beginning years and while I agree they are certainly historically important, they don't quite give me the joy provided by 1940's Pinocchio. Adapted from the Italian story, Disney may have changed things plenty during the writing progress, but the result is a magical and unforgettable experience that proves to not only be a fun romp, but also one of the best cautionary tales brought to the screen.The story is, of course, familiar to everyone. A kindly, old woodcarver named Gepetto builds his own ""little wooden boy"" and soon enough the puppet is brought to life. However, before he can become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself worthy and with Jiminy Cricket as his conscious, he goes out into the real world, full of crooks and criminals. Naturally, Pinocchio the ever youthful puppet, lands into plenty of trouble, first becoming an actor for a scary marionette master and then being turned into a donkey. The audience, especially the young children watching, are absolutely enthralled by the whole production, but also scared by what is shown on screen. Unlike today's cartoons, that try to be as ""friendly"" as possible, Walt Disney wanted his films to leave an impact and Pinocchio certainly fits into that category. While the film enchants, it also provide plenty of frightening moments as well.Quite possibly the scariest scene in the film is when on Pleasure Island, troublesome boys are transformed into donkeys and sent to the salt-mines. Pinocchio can quite possibly be called the greatest anti-cigar film ever made, just for the fact that it doesn't say that smoking is bad, it shows it (although, ironically, Disney himself was a massive smoker)! Another scene that really gets to young audiences is the part in which Pinocchio begins to lie up a storm and his nose grows, even producing a nest with birds at the end. It's enough to make children squirm in their seats and have them afraid to tell a lie again. One of the reasons these scenes are so successful in leading people to the right decision is the fact that Pinocchio is not just a little wooden boy, he represents the child in every one of us: naive and ready to set out into the world, but not fully aware of the dangers awaiting us.Along with the donkey-transformation and nose-growing scenes, the most memorable aspect of Pinocchio is the music. ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" is Disney's anthem for a reason. It's not only beautiful, but also brings about what we all want: to wish for a better world, one without evil puppet masters, children taking bad habits and devilish foxes bringing people to the dark side. Finally, the most touching scene comes in the end, when Pinocchio seems like he might die, but his bravery to save Gepetto finally allows him to become a real boy. Even remembering that scene leads one to smile as it's not only Gepetto and Pinocchio's wish that is fulfilled, but ours as well. Everybody loves a happy ending and Pinocchio features the best of them all. Not only is it the best film made by Disney, but it's also their most optimistic. And that's why Pinocchio is such a classic."
11,Pinocchio,10,28 March 2012,The Allegory of its own Miraculous Creation ...,"""Pinocchio"" is probably the only Disney film where the magic operates almost instantly, using its most representative score for the opening credits. As soon as we hear these magic lyrics of the Oscar-winning ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", we know we're embarked in a whole new dimension, a unique world that only the perseverance and creativity of Disney animators could have lead us to. It became Disney's most defining music, embodying all the values that Disney films stood for: believing in dreams, believing in the ability to 'give life' to drawn characters. The making of the film plays like a poetic allegory, Disney studios ' animators are all little Gepetto's with the same craftsmanship and dedication to their work, and the blue Fairy tale is Walt Disney giving them lives and dreams, something enabling us to identify with them. ""I Dream, therefore I Am"" sounds like Disney's cogito.We instantly identify with ""Pinocchio"" for his dreams to be a real boy, to be a reason for his gentle father's pride. Yet the movie doesn't deal with this existentialist issue, the core of the action in ""Pinocchio"" which on this level, remains one of the most thrilling animated adventures- is the temptation. Tasting jam, stealing, not going to school, lying, childhood is the most exposed moments to temptations, everything is new then everything looks pretty, and when the standard for kids is to obey to authoritarian figures who know the best for them, the most precious lesson in ""Pinocchio"" is not to obey for the sake of obedience but to follow his conscience, to differentiate between right or wrong. That's what being a real boy is about, being unselfish, trustful and brave, not being obedient. And that, my friends, is quite thought-provoking in the way it recognizes a right for children to exercise their free will, but not without a vital element.On that level, the character of Jiminy Cricket is a great invention because he embodies the necessity of a conscience, while most of the time; we can see Pinocchio making his own decisions without questioning Jiminy. Temptation is the ugly cousin of unconsciousness and remains a predominant figure in the movie, always incarnated by adult figures. This aspect conveys the perfect feeling of childhood, a period of our life when we're small and therefore most likely to follow the bigger ones, any adult is a potential parent, and while our parents are the ones who say 'no' or 'don't'. As kids, we're most eager to follow those who say 'yes' and 'do'. Foulfellow and Gideon, the fox and the mute cat are the intermediaries between Pinocchio and the two main villains of the film so even if the duo was meant to be a comic relief, I always found them scary in the way they tried to ruin Pinocchio's life twice.Naturally, as a film conveying a perfect lesson about life, trust, and temptation, it features two villains that had probably inspired many nightmares. From Stromboli and his scary lips, as the ruthless puppeteer who wants to make fortune with the only puppet without strings or the Coachman, the films echoes children's most inner fears: being exploited, tortured and abused by ruthless adults. The image of Stromboli throwing Pinocchio in his cage or the close-up on the Coachman's devilish face, prove that ""Pinocchio"" is darker and more daring than it seems. And to those who associate Disney with cute little animals and singing flowers, I invite them to watch carefully the Pleasure Island sequence, and to see the cute Pinocchio smoking a cigar and drinking a beer with his buddy Lampwick. This sequence alone highlights the dangers of exercising free will without questioning good old conscience.And what follows is another demonstration of Disney's cinematic talent, when we see what happen to the poor boys that made 'jackasses' of themselves. The heart-breaking part when a little Alexander cries for his mommy is scary enough, but kids had to face the metamorphosis of Pinocchio's buddy, his face changing, and the voice of his ""Mommmma"" turning into hysterical braying and desperate glass breaking to measure the danger of making a fool of yourself. This scene alone is one of the most horrific of cinema's history and works as a magnificent symbolism, mirroring the calmer and most poetic moment when Pinocchio's lie makes his nose grow ""until it's as plain as a nose in your face"". Disney has a unique talent to speak through simple images universal statements about childhood and coming of age, and I wonder how many kids thought twice before lying or acting 'jackasses'. The second intervention of the blue Fairy tale informs Pinocchio that his father is in the belly of Monstro, the whale, which leads to the climactic confrontation with the only villain of the film that would be defeated. The part where he swims to Monstro with Jiminy is magnificent and the escape is totally gripping thanks to the patient build-up that made us figure Monstro's reputation and the film's unique use of special effects. The whole film is a masterpiece of innovation and technical accomplishment, with so many zooms and close-up, dominating space and screen like only Disney could have done, the action sequences, the panoramic views on the village the animation of the Fairy tale, were so impressive that I can't count how many times I wondered what the film would have been like in the movie theater.But how many animated films now would show a kid drinking or smoking, turning into a donkey and not even being saved, ""Pinocchio"" is a film that dares to portray kids the way they sometimes do for the sake of intelligence, while 70 years later, for the sake of political correctness, kids have to endure sappy and moralizing educative cartoons. If only for a film like ""Pinocchio"", Walt Disney is the greatest entertainer who ever lived, because one of the few that truly understood what being children meant."
12,Pinocchio,10,28 December 2014,A new favourite added to my favourite animated movies of all time from the Disney canon.,"I never seen this movie in my life till I got it on DVD for the Xmas as Disney is re-releasing all their movies on DVD and Blu-ray for a limited time only. I remember seeing a live action version of this years ago on TV so I knew what to expect once I seen Disney's version. The story is about a wooden puppet named Pinocchio who comes to life thanks to a blue fairy who granted Gepitto(who of course made him in the first place as his a wood carver who makes clocks and puppets)a wish to have Pinocchio become a real boy. So when he does come to life he has to obey orders and learn from right and wrong. Accompanying him is a cricket called Jimmy who is the narrator of this movie as he tells the tale of the puppet who wants to become a real boy. Jimmy acts as Pinocchio's conscience and has to teach him all kinds of things in order to become real. Pinocchio later meets a wolf who only uses him for some puppet show,then Pinocchio is sent to some isolated island with a bunch of kids who later transform into donkeys(don't ask)and his father missing as he is inside a whale.So can Pinocchio prove that he can learn from right and wrong and make his father(or creator's) wish come true?Overall from start to finish I loved this movie as it was my first time to watch it last night on DVD. The animation is beautiful,the story is fantastic and the theme tune for this movie ended up being a global sensation as Disney's theme for the opening of their movies. Overall if you are like me a fan of animated movies and want to try and see something that you never seen before I recommend this to anyone.Parts of this movie reminded me of that made for TV cartoon called The Scarecrow where the scarecrow comes to life by a fairy and becomes a real human only he can see his scarecrow reflection and has to give his life for someone in order for the spell to be permanent?. Maybe it was just me but having said that buy this movie(Pinocchio) on DVD you won't regret it.10/10"
13,Pinocchio,10,19 August 2009,Not Just Great Animation -- A Great Movie,"It certainly is interesting reading other viewers comments. I can't imagine anyone being ""bored"" with this film. But then, I don't even go to movies anymore, because I find those made today to be either horrific and traumatizing, or brain-numbingly stoopid and poorly made. Pinocchio, on the other hand, is the ultimate in everything that is ""movie"" : camera-work, special effects, background music, musical numbers, characterization, story development with narrative sweep, high-drama and low-comedy (but never Lockerroom-low), color, motion, editing, use of sound, artwork, audience manipulation... and in the end, life-affirming! I cannot possibly recommend this movie too highly. In my opinion, considering cinematic effectiveness, Pinocchio rates way up with Citizen Kane, Sherlock Jr., and Battleship Potemkin."
14,Pinocchio,10,16 December 2004,Pure Disney Magic...,"Note: Spoiler contained Few films explore the human psyche as Disney's 'Pinocchio' released in 1940 - a year that heralded a golden decades of classics from the great studio. Its themes and story are truly universal. Indeed, the Disney version of Pinocchio was a film integral to my early memories of childhood and perhaps those of millions of other children (and adults) at heart. But aside from sentimental emotional attachments, Pinocchio is a fine work of art. Technically superb, with an engaging storyline, Pinocchio is truly is a timeless classic and a beautiful film...Few people in the Western world are not familiar with Pinocchio: the mischievous wooden puppet who redeems himself from his not-so-angelic ways, and is finally rewarded for it. Most children are more familiar with the watered down (and some say corrupted) Disney version than the original by Carlos Collodi. I recommend that all children should also read the original book, as it perhaps explores more 'adult' themes, not subjugated into the naivety of the child-world of the Disney Pinocchio. Yet the latter is not as rosy as many Disney offerings - indeed there are some frightening scenes which could be hardly suitable for small children. The scene where the Coachman 'transforms' into his inner sentinel is genuinely disconcerting.Pinocchio was Disney's second offering, after the highly successful and ground-breaking 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' of 1937. Indeed, Disney created an entirely new type of film. The animated feature: the world's and characters of these animated worlds were as 'real' to the audience as any real film. Indeed, the fact that the characters in these films do not exist in real life make the characters all the more convincing. In a sense, the characters inhabit the film as a figure in a painting.The film is a visual delight. The sophistication of animation at the time was almost unheard of, and extremely sophisticated. The scene were the clocks tick in unison was particularly difficult, as was the Monstro scene. Colours and textures are vibrant and lifelike, while the characters are modeled beautifully. Indeed, for pure animated wizardly Pinocchio rivals many present day cartoons.The direction of the film, sound effects and voicing were very good. Dickie Jones, as a young Pinocchio is well-cast. Direction and 'shooting' was far ahead of many films of the time; the early scene where the 'camera' pans across the rooftops of the village reputedly cost over $20,000.Yet the visual and aural aspects are only there to bring the story to life, and this film, as much as any other, displays the strength of good storytelling. While highly moralistic, the film opens with Jimminy Cricket: an endearing, street-smart wanderer who is perhaps more memorable as Pinocchio himself. Geppeto is the kind puppet maker who carves Pinocchio out of wood, who is subsequently granted his wish when Pinocchio is made a real boy. Obviously, Pinocchio does not go to school and this leads him into all sorts of trouble. After escapades in the theatre, Treasure Island and the bottom of the sea he is redeemed by risking his life to save his father.Pinocchio is perhaps the most remarkably 'flat' and lifeless character. He is a 'cipher' without any distinct personality traits. On the other hand, the characters which inhabit this fantasy world (supposed to be set in Italy) are the most memorable of any animated feature. There's Honest John, the wise-talking conman (or con-fox), Lampwick and of course the three villains or 'baddies.' Stromboli is a hot-tempered showmaster: bloated and greedy, he is the epitome of the school bully. The Coachmaster lures boys by the promise of a life of fun and enjoyment, however they are duly punished by him.In conclusion, Disney's Pinocchio is a tribute to old-fashioned storytelling. While Disney may have been a bit too creative with the original Collodi story, he triumphantly succeeds in canvassing perhaps one of some of the greatest concepts in humanity. That of Good and Evil, Redemption, loyalty and sacrifice. Disney was no doubt successful in transferring Collodi's timeless moral onto the screen."
15,Pinocchio,10,17 March 2005,Pinocchio,"This is one of the greatest and one of my favourite Disney films ever made. Pinocchio is a magical and sometimes emotional story about the wooden puppet brought to life by the fairy. Geppetto wishes on a star that his marionette could be a real boy, and the fairy grants his wish. To become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish. Unfortunately, many things happen to him to stop him from achieving this. For example, two villains make Pinocchio famous by appearing in Stromboli's puppet show, and also he goes to a theme park where there are consequences waiting, like turning yourself into a donkey, and also there is the terrifying giant whale, Monstro, to face, but don't worry, there is the magical happy ending where Geppetto and Pinocchio get their wish come true. Of course, this film would not be complete without the giggles of Jiminy Cricket and the wonderful music, especially the Oscar winning song ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" which was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Songs. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Leigh Harline, Paul J. Smith and Ned Washington. It was number 83 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!"
16,Pinocchio,10,19 September 2010,"After some thinking I'm going to call it. ""Pinocchio"" is the best animated film of all time.","This movie is just impossible not to love. For the fantastic music to the AMAZINGLY likable characters this film is simply a masterpiece. Now it was hard to pick the best. You have the ""Toy Story Trilogy"", other Pixar works, ""The Little Mermaid"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""The Lion King"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Spirited Away"", and many other great movies to pick from. After all the time choosing I pick this. Why? Well honestly I have to say the characters in this movie are as likable as movie characters can get. Also it has a lot of good bad guys. My personal favorite is the Honest John and Gideon. I consider them to be the most underrated Disney villains ever. Honest John is a slimy jerk who wants to trick Pinocchio. Gideon is his sidekick who is a brainless idiot. Both of them together create a great villain team. Then I have to mention ""When You Wish Upon a Star"". I think we all know that it is a masterpiece. Disney sure knows it because they put their logo to that song at the beginning of their movies. Then you have the most revolutionizing animation in film history. ""Snow White"" was a revolutionary film, but it was simply baby steps into animated filmmaking. This just a few years later takes the first animated leap into the air. Overall this movie is a masterpiece.4 stars out of 4"
17,Pinocchio,9,16 January 2016,Pinocchio,"I'm actually not sure if I ever saw ""Pinocchio"" before now, but eh. This film took me by surprise, not because I thought it was going to be bad, but at how good it actually was. Based (although from what I've heard without much of the hardcore stuff) on Carlo Collidi's novel of the same name, ""Pinocchio"" tells the story of the titular puppet who longs to become a real boy. When his creator, and Italian toy-maker named Gepetto, wishes for the marionette to come to life, the Blue Fairy makes his wish come true. Not only that, if Pinocchio can prove himself good, honest and unselfish, he will become a REAL boy. With the help of his conscience, Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio will learn how easy it is to be led off the beaten path, and how important it is to put yourself before others, to be honest and to always let conscience be your guide.The animation is stunning, with the shading exquisite, especially on the fur of Tuxedo cat, Figaro, and the wily fox, Honest John. The white finish makes to give the fur a distinct, fluffy look. The animation of the water is amazing, with luscious brushstrokes imitating the tide - hell, even the tide is animated well! The backgrounds are once again lovely, with these amazing panning shots that make it seem like it was filmed by an actual camera. The little details are wonderful, such as the flickering flames, the bubbles and the fish's transparent tail. It's a true work of art.The characters are plenty of fun too. Jiminy isn't half as annoying as I thought he'd be, in fact I found him charming. Pinocchio is that everyman kid, who soaks things in and comes out on top, but still isn't perfect. Not only is he a very good character due to this, but he acts like, well, a real kid! Kids do act selfish, tell lies and go against authority, but sometimes, especially when very young, they may not even know what they're doing is wrong. Pinocchio is a great example of this, and Jiminy walking away, getting lost and so forth shows the swaying of the conscience. It's very clever. Minor characters are shown for just the right amount of time, showcasing their charisma, likability and sometimes fear. The villains are great; all are malicious on different levels, but the one that shocked me most was the Coach Master, who runs Paradise Island. Call me an overthinker (which I am), but I got this child predator vibe off him; inviting kids to have fun, then stripping them down to a primal level ... ugh he was just creepy. Well, whatever the deeper implications may or may not be, the obvious intent is there, and is clever too. I guess it can be read in many different ways.Gepetto was a likable fellow, but who really stood out to me was Figaro, the cat. Let's just say I understand why Disney wanted him to be in the film as much as possible, he's just adorable, and his expressions are great! Overall, ""Pinocchio"" is a wonderful film , with stunning artwork and numerous important messages for children, and even adults."
18,Pinocchio,10,8 January 2012,Disney's Masterpiece. A Genuine Epoch In Animation Art And Cinema In General.,"Disney's 'Pinocchio', in my humble opinion,is Disney greatest achievement. i've studied Disney's life and legacy since childhood and i think my opinion counts for something. it's not like i don't know Disney films or have just a passing relationship with them. i've been a serious fan all my life.actually, 'Dumbo' is my personal favorite from Disney. but personal taste, and opinion based on some education and knowledge, are really two different measures of evaluation. personal taste is often clouded by, well, personal opinion and taste. opinions based on knowledge and education are often less biased and more objective. when speaking from personal feelings,'Dumbo' is the Disney film i truly love the most, but when i evaluate objectively, i realize it's 'Pinocchio' that is Disney's greatest work of cinema.when i was younger this definitely wasn't my favorite. as a matter of fact, my mother recalled that when i was very young, about four or five, my father had to take me out of the movie theater during 'Pinocchio' screaming my head off in terror. i've also talked with other people who said they were Disney fans, and they either had similar disturbances watching this film when younger or they were kind of negative about the film. when i saw it years later on a reissue when i was about nine, i remember finding it interesting, but thought it to be a little weird and kinda creepy. i remember liking things like 'Mary Poppins' or 'Robin Hood' or 'The Aristocats' better, and feeling more comfortable with those kind of Disney films. 'Pinocchio' seemed like a lot of art deco weirdness from decades long ago. it wasn't until i was much older and had read a few books about Disney that i started to have a intellectual appreciation for the classic films. i suddenly found myself rethinking 'Pinocchio' and when i saw it again on a reissue when in my twenties, i was blown away by it and was convinced it was one of the very best films i'd ever seen period. in fact 'Pinocchio' is one of my top five favorites of all time.as i've got older i've also developed more of a taste for classic children's literature and nursery rhymes and fairy tales. they amuse and are whimsical. i actually read Collodi's 'Pinocchio' again for the first time since third grade only a few years ago. can't say i actually liked it except as a curiosity. i greatly admire Lewis Carroll and James Barrie as well as Frank Baum and other children's book writers. can't say i feel that way about Collodi. he was kind of weird and didn't always show a lot of good humour. plus 'Pinocchio' is not a very cute book or character. the drawings in the Disney cartoon are a lot more appealing and cuter. i've never been big on too much moralizing either. doesn't appeal to me. that whole ""a little boy that won't be good thing..."" just plain scares me and annoys me to all hell. for one thing i find being good to tall a order and not of much appeal to me since i am by nature, naturally rebellious. Collodi can sit on his book for all i care, the Disney cartoon simply has some rad looking animation unlike anything seen before or since. it's a little more intense than the usual Disney offerings, even at this time, that's why i dig it.i don't like a lot of petty, judgmental moralizing, just ain't my thing. i also don't wish on stars, believe in guardian angels or sentimentalize too much about childhood or family. but i do think a lot of Disney's 'Pinocchio' is funny, hilarious stuff. if you also like outrageous mind blowing weirdness in your animation soup, this is your mix. this is pretty eccentric and peculiar fixings that still give me creepies and disturb my nightmares as much as any horror show. i love it. and there is even a happy ending, some cute Disney songs and cuddly furry widdle kitty."
19,Pinocchio,,7 January 2016,One of the Studio's Greatest,"Pinocchio (1940) **** (out of 4)Disney's second feature tells the classic story of an elderly toy maker who makes a wooden puppet he calls Pinocchio. Before bed the old man wishes that he had a real boy and for that the fairy godmother brings the wooden doll to life but before he can become a real boy he must prove himself to be good.It's funny to think that upon its original release PINOCCHIO really didn't do that well at the box office and it ended up really hurting the studio. Of course when the film is discussed today it is considered one of the studio's best and most loved films and there's no question that there's really nothing like it. The story has been told countless times by a variety of people but nothing has come close to the magic of this movie.I use the term magic because when you get older and view this movie you can't help but be rather amazed at what all it contains. Of course there's the sweet side of the older man wanting a boy of his own and then there's the side of a puppet wanting to become a real boy. Both of these characters are great as is the Jiminy Cricket character who adds some nice laughs. Not only do you have the cute and charming side but there's also a very dark side to the film.It's funny but many people call this one of the scariest movies they've ever seen and you can read stories about how this movie traumatized young children. The scenes at Pleasure Island where kids are stolen from their families and turned into donkeys is just so dark yet at the same time you can't help but appreciate the message. Finally, there's the action inside the whale, which just adds to a great little sequence full of adventure and fun. Throw in the ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" song and you've really got one of the most complete Disney movies out there. As you'd expect, the animation from these original Disney features is wonderful and I really loved the terrific detail. Of course animation improved over the years but there's still something special and unique to these original Disney movies. PINOCCHIO is clearly one of the studio's best."
20,Pinocchio,10,24 November 2014,The triumph of Disney's Nine Old Men,"Having just re-watched Pinocchio after many years, it's evident that this remarkable feat of animation is the great triumph of Disney's ""Nine Old Men"". These artists were the core of Disney's animation studio for many years, turning out what are now revered as the classics from Disney. What sets Pinocchio apart from every other Disney feature is the sheer depth of care those nine old men (and their assistants) put on the screen. No other Disney feature looks this tremendous, only Snow White comes close. Every, and I mean every, background painting is superb. The medium used for the backgrounds was a water-based paint called gouache. No other animated film looks like this. To think that the entire film was done by hand is amazing, the spectacle of Pleasure Island and the last underwater segment are brilliant compositions by illustrative geniuses. As the darkest fable Disney would bring to the screen, each of the nine old men brought their A game to their characters. Bill Tytla, the studio's ""villain master"" (he was responsible for the unforgettable Chernobog in Fantasia's ""Night on Bald Mountain"" sequence) brings Stromboli to energetic life here. Watch carefully for the table sequence in which Stromboli is eating. He has swallowed part of an onion before berating Pinocchio and shaking the puppet. His breath brings tears to Pinocchio's eyes...this goes by very quickly, but shows the attention to detail crafted in every frame of this terrific film.Many reviews here seem to dwell on the voice acting and the use of ""nobodies"" to speak the lines. One review casually suggests that the actors were simply picked off the street. Nothing could be further from the truth. Even though the actors are uncredited here, the roster of talent was very top-notch for 1940. Comedian Walter Catlett voices the Fox, Catlett was extremely popular at the time and known for his signature round spectacles. The Fox wears these same specs for a brief moment, a nod given to Catlett by the artists. Frankie Darrow was a well known juvenile actor, most famous for his leading role in 1933's ""Wild Boys of the Road"". He voices Lampwick, which is a thinly veiled caricature of the real actor. Dickie Jones, the voice of Pinocchio was another child star who kept a remarkable career alive for many decades. Mel Blanc, the ""man of 1000 voices"" lends his talent to the hiccups of Giddy the Cat, Evelyn Venable is the warm and lovely voice of the Blue Fairy, Clarence Nash, the voice of Donald Duck for years, supplies both Figaro and the donkey brays by the doomed boys of Pleasure Island. Last but not least is Cliff ""Ukelele Ike"" Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket. Edwards will always be known as the man who sang ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" so brilliantly. He owns that song as surely as Judy Garland owns ""Over the Rainbow"". No real voice talent in Pinocchio? Not true. These actors were as famous in their day as the current crop of voices used for animated features. Their work brings the heart to the skill of the animator's art.Still a thrilling experience for fans of the nine old men. In this day of computer technology, it's worth remembering that a computer can't bring the same humanity and love delivered by these great artists."
21,Pinocchio,8,31 October 2013,Probably Disney's best film,"Pinocchio was the only the second ever animated film made by Disney and should rightfully be considered a milestone for animation. The film is easily one of the company's best and has barely dated. It features some of their best work which includes wonderful animation, memorable characters and a really engaging story.The plot sees inventor Geppetto create a wooden puppet named Pinocchio and he wishes for him to be real, the Blue Fairy decides to grant his wish. She gives Pinocchio a conscience in the form of a cricket called Jiminy to keep him out of trouble and if he behaves he can become a real boy. However Jiminy is given a difficult job as Pinocchio frequently faces the wrong types of temptation and it's an uphill struggle to avoid trouble. The plot is brilliant as it quickly moves from one sticky situation to another, never slowing long enough to be boring. The film has plenty of light and dark moments while talking about smart subject matter which keeps everyone entertained.The characters are excellent. Pinocchio isn't the most interesting of leads but he's supposed to be naïve, curious and easily led astray much like any young boy so it's a successful role. Jiminy is a lot of fun, always trying and failing to keep Pinocchio in line. He's laid back but has his limits while his exasperation leads to good comedy and his kind nature makes him likable. Geppetto comes across as a kind man, while silent pets Figaro and Cleo have some very funny moments. Honest John and mostly mute Gideon are an excellent double team and the funniest comic pieces come from their slapstick as well as strange humour. Both Stromboli and the Coachman are two of Disney's most sinister villains, Stromboli being intimidatingly loud and the Coachman restrainedly creepy. The Blue Fairy is a pretty decent guide.The animation is outstanding and some of the best Disney has ever done. When it wants things to be bright and cheerful it adds some beautiful scenery or colours, the scenes in Geppetto's house show that. While for the dark scenes it keeps a great gloomy and murky look, the Red Lobster Inn scene being prime example. A brilliant aspect to the film is the dark tone that it takes on. It never shy's away from the terrible things that can happen if you do wrong and can be rather frightening, the scenes of the kids turning into Donkeys at Pleasure Island and the whole climax with wild whale Monstro are now classic scary scenes. The fact that all the villains never get punished makes it different from the norm and it reflects real life in that way. The film does have a strong emotion impact, when it wants you to feel happy or sad or scared it makes you feel that way with ease whether it be via the artwork and the atmosphere. The music is superb too and the score itself is very memorable, the songs are fantastic as well as rightful classics including 'When You Wish Upon A Star' and 'An Actors Life For Me'. Overall Pinocchio is by far one of Disney's finest films and is a combination of everything great about the company."
22,Pinocchio,10,20 December 2010,Unquestionably the king of Disney's full-length animated movies,"I can assure, very confidently, that this version of 'Pinocchio' is the best Disney full-length animated movie ever. Nothing compares to it. Even in my childhood 'Pinocchio' was already one of my favorite Disney animated movies, if not my favorite. So many years later and time hasn't done anything to harm its magic and charm.Nowadays I don't call just any Disney animated film a masterpiece anymore, so I'm very selective on that matter. But 'Pinocchio' deserves to be called something that honorable.What is it that makes 'Pinocchio' so special? It is based on a Carlo Collodi's tale which isn't even all that great! I think the secret is that they made marvels with this movie. The movie is wonderful, magical, charming and a timeless classic. It is one of those movies made with heart, soul and exceptional talent. I'd go as far as telling they made it in a unique moment of inspiration.There are films that age quickly or were already born obsolete. Others take time to age. But this one never seems to age, which is amazing for something that is now 70 years old! How can that be? Well, it is so advanced for its time that it still looks fresh even for today's standards. I wouldn't guess this is so old if I didn't know already.This is a very complete movie. The artwork is perfect and colorful, everything is carefully drawn and painted. The film is a clever combination of some of the funniest moments in cinema history and some of the darkest and most sinister ever. Animation is terrific. The soundtrack is excellent, with lots of musical pieces to enjoy.This is an Italian tale, so it takes place in Italy, which is great, for it benefits from a certain Italian touch of film-making and Italian charm.The characters are another strength. Geppetto is like a funnier version of Doc from 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. Figaro and Cleo are sweet pets. Pinocchio is far more innocent and much nicer and likable than in the book, being also a cute puppet unlike that of the book. Jiminy Cricket is a cool chap and amusing but at times he seems to have some anger issues and apparent short temper. Stromboli is hilarious and one of the most surly guys I've ever known in a movie. You wouldn't want to be around him when he gets mad! Still, I like Stromboli.I also like Honest John and Gideon. Both are hilarious. Gideon is like a wilder version of Dopey from 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. I wonder if the ""myth"" of the foxes being clever, sly and unreliable started with Honest John. Don't let his name fool you, he is only honest by name. Well, it's not even his real name! As for Monstro the whale, I've never seen quite anything like that before or after. It still impresses in appearance, size, presence, scariness and noise!Title in Portugal: 'Pinóquio'."
23,Pinocchio,10,23 October 2007,Very touching and sweet,"Pinocchio is probably one of the more sentimental Disney films. I wouldn't say that it's my absolute favourite (that award goes to Bambi), but it is certainly a classic film that all ages can enjoy.The film takes a lot of liberties from the original story, but maybe it's for the best. In the book, Pinocchio is a sarcastic and heartless character, and that simply would not work in a Disney film. Even though he's a wooden puppet, like Bambi, he has been modelled to have the features and personality of a young child. Pinocchio is innocent, naïve and sometimes selfish, but he's also playful and often downright adorable. The film has its dark moments, the most notable being what happens on Pleasure Island, and the fate that befalls poor Lampwick. I feel that, as surreal as it is, it conveys a very poignant message - 'The Devil makes work for idle hands.' I've seen some fans clamour for Disney to make a sequel where all the boys are rescued from that dreadful place. As nice as it sounds, I feel that it would take away the whole meaning of the film. Pinocchio is dark, but it's never bleak or depressing. It's very funny too, most of the humour coming from the lovable Jiminy Cricket and Gepetto. The backgrounds are lovely. The village and countryside are typical of rural Italy, but that's not all. The underwater scenes are incredible - remember, this is the first time characters were animated underwater. Although I wonder how Pinocchio managed to breathe?I'm not so keen on the music. 'When you Wish Upon a Star' isn't my favourite Disney song, but it's still quite good. It sure beats any of the Phil Collins music that's piped in over Tarzan soaring through a plastic jungle.As beautiful as it is, Pinocchio does have a some minor flaws. I felt that the goldfish character was completely unnecessary, cute as it was. Also, I felt that the story was a little 'Americanized.' But I've seen worse - take a look at Aladdin. Who's going to think that real Arabs are like that? Not me, that's for sure. Don't let it bother you.I like Pinocchio a lot more than I have before. It's warm, touching, funny, atmospheric and is somewhat a cautionary tale. It's so much more than 'a cute movie about a puppet.'"
24,Pinocchio,9,9 February 2015,iconic Disney classic,"Jiminy Cricket recounts the time he seek warmth in woodcarver Gepetto's home. It is filled with fabulous toys and clocks. He notices the wooden marionette Pinocchio sitting on the shelf. The Blue Fairy brings Pinocchio to life holding out the possibility of becoming a real boy if he proves himself brave, truthful and unselfish. She assigns Jiminy as Pinocchio's conscience. Despite that, Pinocchio keeps getting in trouble and every time he tells a lie, his nose starts to grow.This is such an iconic Disney movie. Pinocchio is a terrific character. He's well drawn and well written. He is a fully realized fallible boy. His struggle is filled with morality lessons. The songs are wonderful with the magical ""When You Wish Upon A Star"". Jiminy Cricket is the most fun mentor any child can have. This is a wonderful movie through and through. The story isn't quite an one story arc as much a series of bad decisions that gets Pinocchio into trouble over and over again. That is probably the only minor hiccup that I can stretch to come up with."
25,Pinocchio,8,23 October 2014,A Very Memorable Childhood Film,"A very wonderful film - one I remembered from my childhood (but then again so are most of the classic Disney films). Pinocchio is a type of film the entire family can love. Nothing offensive about this motion picture, quite the contrary there are good lessons to be learned from Pinocchio. Pinocchio learns what it takes to be a good *human*. So the film is good for young kids.This movie also contains another one of Walt Disney's most memorable songs: When You Wish Upon A Star sung by Cliff Edwards.If you like Disney movies like ""Peter Pan"" or ""Peter and the Wolf"" then you might like Pinocchio.8.5/10"
26,Pinocchio,7,7 December 2013,Walt Disney's Second Animated Film,"The second animated feature film from Walt Disney is a colorful tale with good songs. Woodcutter Geppetto creates his masterpiece, a marionette named Pinocchio, and does such a good job that he wishes he were a real boy, so the Blue Fairy appears and partly grants the wish, making Pinocchio alive but not a real boy until he proves his worth, and enlists Jiminy Cricket to accompany him on his travels, and be his conscience, since Pinocchio has an unfortunate knack for getting into trouble... Beautifully animated film with memorable supporting characters(Honest John, Figaro, Lampwick, etc.) and vividly evil villains, leading to a big climax at sea with a whale. Story may not be entirely satisfying, with unresolved plot threads, but otherwise an appealing fantasy."
27,Pinocchio,7,16 October 2013,When you wish...,"Make a full-length feature cartoon? It couldn't be done. And why should it be anyway, nobody is going to want to watch a 90-minute cartoon. After proving those commonly held thoughts to be oh so wrong with the triumph of Snow White what would Walt Disney do for an encore? Pinocchio came next and showed Disney was not going to rest on his laurels. For as magnificent an achievement as Snow White was the animation on display in that film could be said to be a little crude compared to what was to come. Pinocchio advanced the art form. Visually there is nothing to quibble with here, everything looks fantastic. And what great action too, imagination is not limited to what the animators might be able to achieve. It seems they could achieve whatever they wanted. There are some big, bold sequences in this film that show the great jump the Disney team had made in just three years since Snow White. Disney had succeeded in making the impossible possible.Everyone is familiar by now with the famous story of Pinocchio, that of the wooden puppet magically brought to life. But while he can walk and talk and sing and dance he is still made of wood and wishes to be a real boy. His quest to become real will take him to some very interesting places. Some very bizarre places too. If you're going to accept the basic premise of a wooden puppet brought to life I guess you can accept pretty much anything. But there is the sense that maybe the story ultimately gets a little too weird for the film's good. The second half of the film is not as much fun as the first. It even gets a little scary, poor Pinocchio in almost constant peril. Luckily our puppet hero has some helpers. There's Jiminy Cricket who serves as his conscience, trying to help the incredibly naive Pinocchio know right from wrong. Whenever Pinocchio's really stuck you can count on the Blue Fairy to show up and help out. And of course there is kindly, old Geppetto, Pinocchio's maker, his ""father"" so to speak who has his own strange misadventure.The story lags somewhat in the middle and does take those truly bizarre turns toward the end. But as a whole the story is satisfying, sure to leave a smile on your face. It's so easy to love Pinocchio, the character, that you are willing to overlook any minor quibbles with Pinocchio, the film. And the main character is not the only thing to love. Jiminy is a lot of fun, Geppetto is one of the most kindhearted characters you'll see in any film. And as much as you like the good guys the film gives you some stellar bad guys to hiss at too. The score is terrific. There is the iconic When You Wish upon a Star to open the film and some other good songs sprinkled in along the way. The film provides laughs, charm, suspense, drama, pretty much everything you could ask for. And it looks absolutely magnificent, taking animation to new heights. Pinocchio is one of those films which is not just appreciated but beloved. One of Disney's crown jewels, a film which will live forever."
28,Pinocchio,9,14 August 2007,"A classic from the early years of Disney, containing humour, adventure, sadness, and more!","Three years after the original release of the first Walt Disney movie, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", the public finally got to see this follow-up. Apparently, this second full-length animated feature from Disney (of many) wasn't very successful upon its original release in 1940. However, through the generations, ""Pinocchio"", an adaptation of the story by Carlo Collodi, has generally been regarded as a classic, just like so many other Disney films, both early and recent, and it appears that it spawned many re-releases over the course of several decades! So, since its original release, it has had so much well-deserved belated success! One night, Jiminy Cricket comes into the shop of an inventor named Gepetto, and witnesses him putting the finishing touches on wooden marionette, and trying it out. Gepetto names this marionette Pinocchio. Just before he goes to sleep, the inventor looks out the window and sees a wishing star, so he makes a wish. His wish is for his new marionette to become a real boy! While Gepetto is asleep, and Jiminy is still awake, the Blue Fairy comes in and partially grants the inventor his wish, making Pinocchio alive, but still wooden. In order for Gepetto's wish to be fully granted, Pinocchio will have to prove himself ""brave, truthful, and unselfish."" Jiminy is assigned by the Fairy to be Pinocchio's conscience. The next morning, after Gepetto sends Pinocchio to school, the living marionette is soon mislead, going somewhere else, and Jiminy Cricket finds that getting him to listen to his conscience isn't easy! As you would expect from an animated Disney flick, this is a musical, and as such, it has several memorable songs, including the Oscar-winning ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", along with ""Give a Little Whistle"", and others. It's also a very adventurous piece, and has a bit of humour (including a couple hilarious early scenes involving Honest John and the clumsy Gideon), as well as moments of sadness or fright, and some morals, such as telling the truth. Overall, ""Pinocchio"" is a bit darker than most other films in Disney's catalogue, whether you would consider that a good or bad thing. Like the other Disney classics, however, this one can very enjoyable for kids, as well as others are still into animated family adventures after their childhood! I really don't know what to say about this movie that probably hasn't already been mentioned so many times before!"
29,Pinocchio,7,3 March 2006,imaginative and moral,"Pinocchio is a Disney animated story about a wooden puppet who wants to become a real boy. Together, with his conscious Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio learns some morals to bring him onto a path to becoming a real boy. Pinocchio learns that lying is wrong and that greed is wrong, and he is lured into danger by wanting to fulfill the wrong needs. This is a pleasant little story with plenty of imagination and lessons to be learned, and this will appeal to smaller children. I enjoyed this film when I was younger because it portrays life in a more realistic way, and Pinocchio must learn the consequences to his actions and poor judgement. It is a pretty dark film for a children's film, but it does have a happy and insightful ending."
30,Pinocchio,10,3 July 2016,Walt Disney's Masterpiece. The best Animated feature of All Time,"I suppose an argument could be made for ""Fantasia"" as well, but certain sequences shine better than others, and it has that boring narrator. Pinocchio makes the best use of the revolutionary multi-plane camera and almost has a 3D quality about it. The most important and dramatic parts are animated with exquisite and exacting detail. The water and fire sequences are hypnotically lifelike and realistic. As he did in other (early) cartoon features, other connecting parts of it are drawn with a ""broader"" stroke and, while very well drawn, have a bit less detail and treatment, to carry the story along. Much precise and amazing rotoscopic action. Magnificent backgrounds and truly scary moments. Re-released to theaters circa 1955, I was only 5-years-old. The songs and ""voice-overs"" (mostly uncredited) have never been equaled. The talents of Mel Blanc and Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket. They tell me that The Blue Fairy was drawn to resemble Jean Harlow. An unforgettable musical score and numbers such as ""I Got No Strings"" and Oscar-winning song ""When you wish upon a star"". As a 5-year-old I still remember being awe-stuck and truly scared when cigar-smoking Lampwick turns into a donkey on Pleasure Island and everyone is swallowed by Monstro The Whale. I was horrified when Pinocchio ""died"" until he became a real little boy. Worth viewing (as is Fantasia) on an old-fashioned giant-sized theater screen, if you ever can."
31,Pinocchio,10,2 June 2015,The second Disney animated feature film and probably the best one to date,"This is a Walt Disney Animation Studios production. There will be spoilers ahead:Pinocchio is the second animated feature done by Disney, following the very successful feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It can be argued that Pinocchio is the best animated feature Disney has made thus far. The animation is excellent, the film is visually beautiful and it has one of the most fantastic dramatic sequences done in an animated film (the climactic Monstro scenes). The characters are fully realized for the most part and the story and plotting are strong.The film is framed by Jiminy Cricket and opens with the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", sung by Jiminy. He then tells the story of a wish coming true. Jiminy is an interesting character, given that he becomes the ""conscience"" of a wooden boy even though he starts out as a down on his heels vagabond in tattered clothes who sneaks into a shop to get warm. Jiminy is actually something of a rogue and a ladies' man. He's also not particularly good at the ""conscience"" job much of the time.The story revolves around Pinocchio, a wooden marionette made by Geppetto, a woodcarver who wishes upon a star that Pinocchio become a real boy. The Blue Fairy hears this wish and makes it come partially true, bringing Pinocchio to life as a wooden boy. In order to become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself, brave, unselfish and honest. The first part of the film sets the characters up, including a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo (a few short films with Figaro and Cleo were also made).Pinocchio winds up sent off to school by himself and runs into Honest John, the principal villain, and his sidekick, Gideon, who shanghai Pinocchio by selling him to Stromboli, a puppeteer who puts Pinocchio in his show and then in a cage to hold him against his will. Pinocchio is rescued ineptly by Jiminy and then effectively by the Blue Fairy. Pinocchio becomes frightened and lies to the Blue Fairy. She helps him anyway, warning him that it would be the last time.Rescued once, Pinocchio again falls prey to Honest John again and is sold again, sent to Pleasure Island with other boys, said boys ultimately turning into donkeys. Jiminy helps Pinocchio, now with donkey ears and a tail, to escape and make his way back home, to find Geppetto, Figaro and Cleo gone to search for him. The three have been swallowed by Monstro, a giant whale. Pinocchio heads out to save them, seeking out Monstro with Jiminy's help.This part of the film is beautiful, the fish detailed magnificently. Pinocchio finds Monstro and Geppetto and crew. He figures out a way for them to escape and manages to be brave, truthful and unselfish by rescuing Geppetto at the risk of himself. There is a happy ending to the story.This film has been available on DVD and Blu Ray and is well worth getting. Most highly recommended."
32,Pinocchio,10,8 September 2014,Animated perfection,"After the major success of Disney's first ever full-length animated feature: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the company was able to create a couple of new full-length classics. The one that followed up the inaugural Snow White was none other than Pinocchio, the famous story about a wooden Italian boy who was created by the woodcarver Gepetto and brought to live by the blue fairy. Pinocchio proved to be less successful at the box office than its processor was. This can probably be linked to the outbreak of World War II, which prevented the film of becoming a success in Europe. Even though Pinocchio wasn't a major hit financial wise, it proved to be the embodiment of animated perfection. The story is based on the book 'The adventures of Pinocchio' by Carlo Collodi. The book is really dark and even sadistic, so it seems obvious that Walt's team didn't literally follow the book, because that wouldn't have struck a right chord with the audiences. In the film, Gepetto (voiced by Christian Rub) is a joyful old woodcarver, who lives with his cat, Figaro and his fish, Cleo. He carved a little boy out of wood and that is, of course, Pinocchio (voiced by Dickie Jones). One night, after Gepetto wished upon a star, the blue fairy appears and brings Pinocchio to live. She appoints a Jiminy Cricket (voiced by Cliff Edwards) as his conscience. If Pinocchio stays brave, truthful and unselfish, he'll one day become a real boy. Together, Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket encounter all sorts of adventures. They meet Honest John (Voiced by Walter Catlett), a sly fox who wants some money, so he brings the naive Pinocchio to the puppet maker Stromboli, who imprisons Pinocchio because he makes him rich due to his success as a puppet without strings. He escapes, but Honest John sends him off to Pleasure Island. The kids can do all the rebellious things they want to do there. Pinocchio meets Lampwick, a rebellious boy who loves to do naughty things. Jiminy discovers that the boys are turned into donkeys who are being sold to salt mines to work as slaves. He tries to convince Pinocchio and Lampwick, but the latter already turns into a donkey. Pinocchio escapes the island in time and only has a tail and a pair of long ears. Meanwhile, they find out that Gepetto and his pets have been swallowed by a whale. Pinocchio and Jiminy attempt to save them and what follows is an exciting finale where they try to escape from the furious whale. Pinocchio dies. However, the blue fairy brings him back to life and the entire family rejoice. Pinocchio has been described by many critics as the most perfect Disney classic of all time. It's hard to argue. It isn't my favorite, but you can't deny the marvelous animation. There are just so many fabulous details. Not only in the drawing of the main characters, but also in the backgrounds. Everything has been given thought. The story is very exciting as well. Pinocchio is likable as a character who has a hard time separating right from wrong and Gepetto is a nice old man, who just comes off as very likable. The side characters are fun as well. The villains are designed perfectly. My favorite moment of the film is the scene where they escape from the whale. That scene is just pure brilliance. It's exciting all the way through and the design of the underwater world and especially the whale is mesmerizing. The ending is joyful and fits perfectly within the film. A timeless classic that can be enjoyed by the entire family."
33,Pinocchio,10,5 July 2014,Cleverer than heck! Astounding craftsmanship and storytelling,"Disney turned the original Pinocchio story into a colorful metaphor for the evolution of the soul.To me, the most jawdropping aspect of the work is the non-stop barrage of sheer craftsmanship. From the visuals, to the audio, to the voice work, to the songwriting... and on and on and on...And, after all that has been taken into account, we're left with an expansive, ambitious picaresque adventure that seems to modulate the main character through paces toward full personhood. It's a fun, non-preachy extended sermon on getting in tune with your higher self and getting on the road to heaven. Sure, Jimminy mounts the Jack-in-the-Pulpit to pontificate... but that's the point: He looks silly. In the end, Pinocchio takes his lumps, pays his dues, and grows up.Wot a story! Wot a production! You have to see it!"
34,Pinocchio,10,10 November 2013,Pinochio - A Disney Masterpiece of Shakespearean Proportions,"I am glad to have lived long enough to even start to really appreciate this animated film. Of course, ""Snow White"" was seen as the turning point in animation between stick figures with ears traced around nickles and dimes and characters that reflected truly lifelike creations; between complete story lines and short skits. This is true but ""Pinochio"" raised the bar with its animation to a level that still astonishes me even though computer animation should have desensitized me to its virtuosity. To have made ""Pinochio"" manually is a testament to the ingenuity of the human mind and the dexterity of the human hand. It is also a testament to the fact that true craftsmen are never satisfied by merely creating something that pleases an audience; they need to satisfy the urge to create something that identifies them as unique. Samuel Johnson said of Shakespeare that he need not have created such masterpieces written in iambic pentameter to have satisfied his audience. Look at every scene in Pinochio and you see craft and sophisticated thought beyond what an audience might require. There are visual puns, there is detail that only by stopping the frame that one can appreciate and there is attention to acting skills invested in each character. Any director of a live film can point a camera at actors performing and get some added interest by accident but, in animation,everything is intentional.Nothing in the background has not been scrupulously considered and meticulously drawn. In live action, each scene can be covered from various angles and then cut. Look at how Pinochio, ""Honest"" John and Gideon are seen from above as they gambol off to meet the coach for ""Pleasure Island"". It has to be drawn that way. How many hours of watching live actors and translating it into animation must that have taken? Did they really need to do it? No. But I am sure that the animators considered it a great challenge to their craft. Thanks to them all for making ""Pinochio"" and for enriching my understanding of what human beings can achieve."
35,Pinocchio,10,8 November 2013,"""Oh, I think it's swell...""","Okay, I'm gonna be saying ""I love"" a lot in this review, so I'm afraid you'll just have to bear with me! It's just that there is so very much to love in this classic, I remember it all so well... Pinocchio is for me, Disney homebase. I find it the most magical, mystical, frightening - from my point of view truly the best work they ever did. It's so magnificent in so many different ways and it will hold up forever. There's so many great characters, Dickie Jones' voice was very cute, I actually learned how to whistle with the help of the second song. The Blue Fairy is a stunningly radiant gossamer creation of heavenly grace, in as much her warm bearing as her design. She breaks her own cardinal rule of not helping out twice though! I love the bratty little expressions of impish Figaro, he moves just like a real kitten. Gepetto's so mean when he's using the as-yet inanimate(and ~creepy~) Pinocchio to spook Figaro and kick him up the butt! And I love little relationship he and sweet Cleo the goldfish have together and how she wants nothing more than to be the stubborn cat's friend! I find the scene really charming and funny where Gepetto goes out to search for Pinocchio and Figaro immediately wants to eat his dinner but Cleo forbids it and he obeys, it's so adorable. She even manages to be cute during a very sad scene where she's preparing her own grave! The delicate effect of her fins as she swirls about is superb. I love the numerous rich details and touches that are in any given scene, particularly the opening sequence with all the precious clocks trinkets and music boxes, which I think is one of the more visually breathtaking moments in the film. I still remember how I felt when I first saw it when I was really little. Everything about all the sights and sounds of the intricate little devices and toys entranced me, and filled my young mind with wonder... And it actually still does, I have never lost that whenever I watch that magnificent sequence. The way Geppeto switches everything on to celebrate mirrors the ending. The enchanting and brilliant sequence where they're under the sea is my all-time favourite underwater Disney animating, even more so than ""The Little Mermaid."" It's really funny and captivating with all the curious sea life cautiously following close behind, and Jiminy riding on a seahorse. Good job they dived in when they did, Jiminy was about to transform into a little asshopper(!) But they're all living under a dark cloud, as even the lowly clam has learned to fear the wrath of Mighty Monstro! The final act is just incredible and ups the ante in terms of action no limit. Just what the heck kinda demonic whale was Monsto meant to be anyway? He's more like a colossal, juggernaut engine of towering destruction than a living creature. There's such an awesome sense of momentum and force in the movements as he twists and bulldozes through the ocean after them like a freight-train, only to end up inadvertently pushing them out of harm's reach in the end with his own power. How on earth did they manage to draw and animate all the ripples, bubbles, foam, swells and general tumult in that churning ocean so realistically? They must've driven themselves half-crazy with the effort! I appreciate very much how the film doesn't pander and is at times quite bleak and poignant, like when Gepetto's searching for Pinocchio in the rain and the coach that he just happens to be on goes right by. So close and yet so far... And in the scene that always gets me a little teary eyed where they return to the cottage to find it barren and empty, which is something that I find so achingly sad and heartbreaking. And there's also the lament scene inside the whale. These parts are not very reassuring, but they sure are emotionally powerful. Although much of it is bright and whimsical, the darkness of this movie has its value as well. Not everything works out perfectly nice for everybody. How quickly Stromboli becomes terrifying as he flies off into a rage and violently slams little Pinoccio into the cage of certain doom, switching the whole tone of the suspiciously jovial scene as he does so. And the donkey transformation was even more horrendous than I remembered. The way Lampwick cries out for his mama is so grisly and disturbing. And all the poor misbehaving boys who are just left as donkeys forever on cursed Pleasure Island forever and never seen again, and the wicked man running the place who's never defeated - there's some serious grimness to it, and that's a good thing and I'll tell you why. This world can be a very cruel place, and especially as kids we can never be too sure about strangers, even if they appear very generous at first. And the chilling glamour of Pleasure Island teaches that, if something seems too good to be true it probably is, and those are still good lessons I think. And although the ending is a happy one and does indeed leave you with a positive and hopeful feeling, the movie still takes you on many emotional twists and turns before it reaches that grand point, it's very much earned. My last word might sound a bit corny..but what they did with this, their work, way back then, it was so beautiful, and we'll always remember it. This timeless masterpiece is Disney's brightest star forever, and I now look back on it with a very warm sense of nostalgic wonder..."
36,Pinocchio,10,16 August 2013,Arguably the greatest animated feature ever made,"I have seen most of the animated Disney canon, the best of Pixar, the best of Ghibli, and so many other animated films, but not a one of them have continued to overpower and move me the way Pinocchio (1940) has. Ever since I first saw it at age 16, it has been my favorite animated feature.The animation is breathtaking. It's leagues ahead of what was achieved in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and still leagues ahead of most animated features made since.It's pure hand-drawn magic, almost impossible to surpass. (Pixar claimed Ratatouille (2007) surpassed it, but CG and traditional animation are two mediums too different to compare in my opinion. It's like comparing paintings and photography.) Every time I watch the film, I always notice some nuance or item in the background.The story is toned down and altered from the original novel, but what remains in this film is so good that I do not care. In fact, I think some of the changes were more effective, such as making the titular character more appealing. He is simply naive and thoughtless, not malicious. Pinocchio isn't the only one to develop either: after several viewings, I noticed that the initially irresponsible Jiminy and Geppetto also go through their own character arcs.Though The Black Cauldron (1985) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) are considered dark, they barely hold a candle to the frightening world of this film. As wicked as the Horned King and Frollo were, they got their comeuppance and did not live to see the end of their respective films. Not so in Pinocchio: the villains are not defeated, they will get to keep tricking, exploiting, murdering, and enslaving people long after the credits stop rolling. The heroes cannot defeat them. The best they can hope for is that they can escape with their lives and learn from the mistake. The movie is plainly stating that there is no way to rid the world of evil, rather bleak for a Disney film. (Thank God they never made a horrid DTV sequel where the boys on Pleasure Island are rescued, as it would undermine the horror of the original movie.) However, Pinocchio is at its heart an uplifting story. Though the world is cruel and evil cannot be vanquished, goodness and love still exist. The American Film Institute did right for once by putting it on their Most Inspiring Movies list.Pinocchio is a lovely experience, not only a great Disney film or a great animated film, but one of the greatest pictures ever made PERIOD. Don't miss out."
37,Pinocchio,10,14 December 2012,A definite 10,"I know a 7.6 rating on IMDb is pretty darn good, but Pinocchio deserves better than this. I've owned the VHS of Pinocchio for years as a kid, but always perceived it as too dark and somber so I stuck to the more upbeat Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. It was only last year that I stumbled upon a Blu ray copy, that I rediscovered it. I was shocked to see how much beauty and elegance this film possesses. Music - it's poignant and memorable, and rightfully won two academy awards for score and song.Animation - it's amazing how much we're overlooking when watching these films as kids. From Geppetto's workshop to the Italian village to Pleasure Island to the bottom of the ocean. The image is consistently rich in detail and the velvety texture applied to the backgrounds is extraordinary. Like Snow White, Fantasia and Bambi, ""Pinocchio"" makes extensive use of the multi plane camera, giving the picture consistent depth and realism. I urge everyone who owns a Blu ray player to buy a copy. It will blow you away. Characters - Pinocchio features some of the most appealing characters in Disney history. I think everyone will agree that most of them here have become iconic: Pinocchio, Jimini, Geppetto, the Blue Fairy, Honest John, Gideon, Stromboli & Monstro. The story of course is the heart of the movie and there is something very intimate and warm about it. A lonely elderly man wishing for his puppet to become a real boy and then the obstacles that follow. The whole atmosphere of the film is yet to be recaptured and probably never will, given that Disney films nowadays lean toward gimmicky fluff and 3D.Years after my first viewing of this film, I have finally come to appreciate the beauty of it. I wish it had happened earlier. But better later than never."
38,Pinocchio,10,22 October 2010,Pinocchio is still celebrated as one of the Disney's greatest achievements.,"Based on Carlo Collodi's didactic fable of 1881, the film transforms the delinquency of Pinocchio and the cruel anarchy of childhood into a rites-of-passage story of innocence, redemption and American heroism - albeit one populated by Dickensian grotesques. Pinocchio was embraced by critics but resulted in an initial box office failure. The $2.6 million outlay seemed unlikely to be recouped, particularly as the European market had been shut down by the outbreak of the Second World War, but subsequent re-releases bolstered the film's reputation and ensured that it ran into profit. Pinocchio represents the defining moment in the evolution of Disney's style, which was predicated partly on 'realist' authenticity and partly on caricaturial innovation. The film's greatest achievements are Hamilton Luske's sensitive direction of live-action movement that was then used as rotoscoped animation; Bob Jones's three-dimensional models of key interiors; Bill Tytla's striking animation of the muscular energy of Stromboli; Oscar Fischinger's 'wand-sparkle' for the Blue Fairy; and Woolie Reitherman's extraordinary animation of Monstro the whale. The involvement of such talented technicians and artists contributed to the trend in animation towards the cinematic conventions of the 'real' and the fullest emotive exploitation of the mise en scene while demonstrating and celebrating the freedoms of self-conscious artifice. This aesthetic contradiction still underpins the orthodoxies of feature animation today, but has rarely been achieved with such graphic detail and emotional intensity."
39,Pinocchio,10,3 February 2010,Perhaps as perfect as any film can get,"It really sometimes is a shame that the name ""Disney"" has become associated with childish fancy and mass-market film production. Whilst it would be buffoonery to deny that such things have always come out of the Disney studio, the association with silliness and fabricated maternal comfort really discredits the likes of ""Pinocchio"". Based on the Italian author Carlo Collodi's story about the puppet with a knack for getting into trouble, it was only the second animated feature put out by Disney. It is also perhaps the best animated film to have seen the light of day - yes, even beating ""Toy Story"" and all of the other beloved Pixar films.Technically speaking, everything that ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" did well is done even better in ""Pinocchio""; the scope and attention to detail are greater, the music and songs are of a higher level (""When You Wish Upon a Star"" has indeed gone on to become the anthem of Disney and of hope in general) and the animation seems more confident and fluid. Yet the main reason ""Pinocchio"" works is that it truly seizes upon the opportunity of going beyond being merely a fantastical fable and provides a story that resonates with the soul of an individual in the world of reality. It doesn't simply patronise or moralise the audience; as with a select other few films including ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""E.T."" and ""Amélie"", the fantasy on screen succeeds so well in that it truly parables that of an everyday society devoid of magic - and allows for criticism of accepted attitudes.In creating a mythical world, the plot is truly complex and deals with with so many timeless themes in some form or another - responsibility, love, morality and exploitation are just some examples. It equally strays very much from being a pick-me-up in the way that the likes of ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" might be, and there are countless truly thrilling or downright scary moments, in particular the scene in which the lazy yet naive delinquent Lampwick meets his fate. There are far more antagonists in ""Pinocchio"" than the average Disney favourite, all of whom - unlike the numerous femmes fatales and odious beings in other films - do not appear on screen after their subsequent wrong doings and arguably remain unpunished, much like the villains of everyday life. One can thus imagine that Honest John and Gideon are conning even more victims or that the systematic horrors of Pleasure Island shall continue. This is what truly makes the scenes of cruelty so disturbing; underneath all of its fantastical trimmings, its sheer acceptance certainly resonates with a society of any generation (consider that this film was made and released simultaneously to policies of appeasement and the ultimate road to war).Yet there are moments of happiness, hope and joy in ""Pinocchio"", and their place in a film often so frank with the often questionable behaviour of a society makes them all the more wonderful and joyous. ""Pinocchio"" is quite frankly one of the best things ever captured on celluloid."
40,Pinocchio,7,20 October 2008,Eerie and bizarre early Disney animation that delivers principally through its ambiguous atmosphere and world in which it's set.,"Pinocchio seems to be a film about dreams; about people who can become something that in the real world they cannot; about achievement, but not on an ordinary level. This is best highlighted throughout the film when events and themes of real life situations such as having to go to school and having to carve a trade (in the toy making business, in this case) are counter balanced with walking, talking foxes and magical fairies coming down from the sky. The best thing about the film is that it manages to set the film in an ordinary and everyday village located within the Alps mountain range and yet incorporates these elements of the bizarre and of the unnatural seamlessly.The scene that best highlights this is when Pinocchio himself is running to school and Hounest John (Catlett) notices the wooden puppet in question doing exactly that. He stops, thinking it very odd and intervenes. And yet I suppose nobody is supposed to batter an eyelid if they themselves saw a fox walking down the street with a top hat and cigar. So if the film could be about dreams in the sense Pinocchio's father Geppetto (Rub) wants a son and Pinocchio himself (Jones) wants to be a 'real boy' then the film certainly recognises this and compliments the theme with a number of bizarre and surreal scenes that even today, very much work on a level of recognition and respect but also surrealism.The creepiest thing the film has going for it throughout is the manner in which it gives animals such as Figaro the cat, Cleo the goldfish and Monstro the whale such humane characteristics. Figaro is able to understand Geppetto's English and display certain reactions but is not able to reply; Cleo is able to become aware of what's going on around her despite being inside a bowl and is able to display all the necessary human emotions of panic, fear and is able to blush when necessary situations arise. Monstro the whale is a beast displaying copious amounts of greed and sloth in the sense he sleeps and eats whenever one of the instincts takes over and is able to identify the a certain character's boat before unleashing a wrath of anger.This idea is actually toyed with by the film later on in one of the more bizarre sequences during which human beings turn into animals, those being donkeys, and it's this scene that stays with most people. This is most probably because the boundaries between animal with human instincts and human with human instincts (albeit the want to smoke and drink) are blurred resulting in human characters becoming animals and submitting to the lowly 'braying' noise donkeys make as they sit in their cages, beaten and consequently submissive. What's quite interesting here is Pinocchio's overall characteristic in the sense he is wooden and thus; being a 'real' boy or a 'real' human as it were further brings attention to the film's study of the escapist-come-realist universe.As a study of character, Pinocchio's is the most emphasised. As a character, he is new to the world and naïve as a consequence; failing to spot evil and wrong-doers no matter how obvious. He even has the manners to shout 'goodbye' to one of his oppressors, thus risking re-capture. If the film is about things and animals that 'come alive' and perform beyond their capabilities, it is fitting the protagonist's quest should revolve around becoming something he is not and this acts as a further example of transgression. If we analyse most of the other boys at the doomed fair ground and look at their transgression into another being, it can be read into quite obviously that cigars, beer and hustling take you one way: the salt-mines or the circus (as printed on the donkey's cages) but resisting the urge and listening to a conscience or generally not taking to the temptation will lead you to be a 'real' boy, then onto a 'real' man since after boyhood comes manhood.This is Disney's morality tale and it's the sort of material that is always going to be bleak no matter who takes it on, cartoon or no cartoon. But Disney's attention to animation is also key, having their antagonists come across as large, booming men in Stromboli and the Coach Driver (both Judels) and having Hounest John a fox; an animal most animated films since would have you think the sliest and slimiest animal of them all; this film may well have broken that particular mould. I also liked the manner in which the antagonistic figures smoked their cigars, creating shapes and bizarre circles with their smoke whereas Pinocchio himself on the other hand can barely smoke it right and consequently goes green, the beginning of a short stint whilst under the influence of Marijuana, given that the Marijuana symbol is in his mouth following a botched pool shot.In terms of aging, the film is faultless on the animation side. The painstakingly slow process of each frame can only be marvelled at and with computers doing more of the films nowadays, the marvelling will definitely continue. I don't like the character accents and the issues I have with type casting involve Stromboli being an unnecessarily oddball Italian and his show comprising of all the clichés you'd expect with Russians, French and Dutch puppets complete with stereotypical imagery. But the film remains powerful and eerie at other times, even if it is down to the oddball mesh of a universe it is set. This is no doubt an impressive film."
41,Pinocchio,8,21 March 2008,"""When you wish upon a star""","Walt Disney's 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)' was one of the defining landmarks in animation history, and proved both critically and commercially successful at the time of its release, briefly the high-grossing movie of all time. Not only was it the first Technicolor feature-length film, but it also set incredible new standards for animated colour and detail, aided by pioneering use of the multiplane camera. Three years later, Disney released a further two feature-length offerings, both of which proved initially unprofitable, but have since grown in stature to become indelible classics of American animation. 'Pinocchio (1940)' and 'Fantasia (1940)' are two wholly different feature films: whilst the latter is almost experimental in nature, a compilation of music-inspired segments that Disney envisioned as a ""roadshow event,"" the former film is much closer to the spirit of Disney's previous success, adapting Carlo Collodi's 1883 story ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" as a heart-filled children's tale, occasionally dark in tone, but never lacking a child-like sense of wonder.An old and lonely toymaker, Geppetto (voiced by Christian Rub), has made a life out of bringing happiness to young children, and his homely cottage is filled with creative cuckoo-clocks and other whirring wooden contraptions. Aside from his two loyal pets, Figaro the cat and Cleo the goldfish, Geppetto lives a lonesome existence, and yearns for the love of a real child. One night, after finally completing a dancing wooden puppet named Pinocchio, the old inventor wishes upon a star that his creation be made into a real boy, never imagining for a moment that his wish might actually come true. In the basking glow of the moonlight, the beautiful Blue Fairy (Evelyn Venable) materialises in the silent bedroom, and, as our humble presenter Jiminy Cricket (Cliff Edwards) watches from the shadows, the static wooden puppet is magically given life, and must prove himself worthy before he is transformed into a ""real boy."" Jiminy agrees to act as Pinocchio's conscience, steering him towards the path of righteousness, a task that proves considerably more difficult and dangerous than he could have imagined.As was the case in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' the animators offer audiences so many colourful characters that at least one is bound to become your favourite. If the film's modest heroes don't strike your fancy, then you might also choose from the sly fox, J. Worthington ""Honest John"" Foulfellow (Walter Catlett) or his mute sidekick Gideon (Mel Blanc), who attempt to exploit Pinocchio for their own profit. There's also Stromboli (Charles Judels), the greedy Italian puppeteer, Lampwick (Frankie Darro) the mischievous little scamp who finds himself turning into a donkey, and Monstro, the immense, horrifying sperm whale whose heaving form instills terror in every marine creature in the ocean. The film's animation, though perhaps not quite as vibrantly colourful as in 'Snow White,' is impeccably detailed, and often exceedingly beautiful. With excellent characters, and a worthy moral of behaving yourself and being selfless towards others, 'Pinocchio' will persevere for many years to come as an endearing family favourite."
42,Pinocchio,10,7 September 2007,Prove Yourself,"I remember watching this as a child, and loving it. I am still in love with the incredible art design and detail inscribed on each frame of film. I have read the book as well, but I still think that Disney did the right thing by making Pinocchio likable from the start, allowing us to really feel for him and share his world more easily. The little puppet gets very hard-earned lessons in responsibility, truthfulness, bravery, and selflessness. The trip to Pleasure Island stands out in most folks' memory because of the ""Donkey sequence"", but I was never frightened by that part.What scared me was The Coachman. Here we have one of the most evil characters ever to grace the world of film, and yet he is almost forgotten. Consider this: the island itself is not cursed; it only changes one's outside to match the nature of the soul inside. We see the results of carnal frenzy indulged, the basest desires are here encouraged and granted beyond sane measure (gluttony, anger, destruction, greed, theft, etc.). By living like animals, the children sacrifice their humanity in the purest way possible. Can you imagine what would happen if Virtue was encouraged in this place? What would they become if that were so?The Coachman is truly wicked because he is making a great profit by twisting not only the fools he picks up, but by perverting the island itself to his own ends! That being said, this truly IS one of the greatest animated works ever made, and deserves to be in everyone's collection."
43,Pinocchio,10,7 February 2006,A Disney Classic!!!,"In a small Italian village, a lonely woodcarver named Geppetto makes a marionette, who he calls Pinocchio. Later that night, he wishes that Pinocchio were a real boy. The Blue Fairy awakens Pinocchio, but tells him that he needs to be proved brave, truthful, and unselfish to become a real boy. To help him accomplish this, she appoints the happy go lucky Jiminy Cricket as his conscience. He does prove himself truthful-after being captured by the evil puppet master Stromboli. But the REAL test comes later, when he discovers that Geppetto has been swallowed by a whale named Monstro. This is where he proves himself brave and unselfish, when he risks his life to save Geppetto. He is later turned into a real boy!When this beautiful film was released 66 years ago, it unfortunately was not a hit at the box office. The reissues later helped it to become one of Disney's greatest films. The voices, including Dickie Jones as Pinocchio, and Cliff Edwards as Jiminy, bring the characters to life. The script is well written (it was adapted from a book by Carlo Collodi.) The backgrounds are spectacular. The film's many songs, including ""Hi Diddle Dee Dee"", ""I've Got No Strings"", and the award-winning classic ""When You Wish Upon A Star"", are (in my opinion) the best part. This film has a special meaning to me (I first saw it on a reissue in the 90's). See this movie. It has all the ingredients of a Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10"
44,Pinocchio,10,12 September 2002,Superb Filmmaking,"Not only is Pinocchio the greatest animated film of all time, it is also one of the greatest films of any genre of all time.  Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, every time I see Pinocchio I get something new out of it.  The story still speaks to people today and the technical aspects still amaze me.  This film is responsible for generations of children who have grew up to not lie.This also is a milestone in filmmaking technique.  Before the 1940s, people really didn't know how to make films.  Some people like Charlie Chaplain had a good idea, but nobody made films with the suspense and fascination Pinocchio had.  The scene where Monstro attacks was really the first film to use size and scope and tell a story with characters that you cared about with hardly any dialogue.  Think about it.  There's the huge whale on one scale; every move of its fins creates tidal waves.  There's Pinocchio on another scale; trying to swim for his life so that he won't be swallowed. And there's Jiminy Cricket on yet another scale; trying to help out but he's so small he can hardly accomplish anything.  Each scale is almost its own story! The three scales are intercut so well and so suspenseful that this has become one of the greatest scenes of all time."
45,Pinocchio,10,4 August 2005,"Truly magnificent, a masterpiece","Pinocchio is one of those films that you can't help re-visiting.I remember watching as a child on TV one Christmas and have seen it numerous times since. I also had the pleasure of playing Geppetto in a school production.The animation is fantastic and has set the standard for today. The use of multi-plane techniques add real dimension especially when you look through the window into Geppetto's shop for the first time. You believe it's real.I recently acquired Pinocchio on DVD and the restoration job is superb and it still makes me cry, 20+ years after I first saw it.A truly magnificent film and hard to believe it's over 60 years old and still is up there animation wise with the Disney films of today.If ever a film deserves to be called a masterpiece, it's this."
46,Pinocchio,9,21 February 2005,Probably the best animated feature in existence.,"It hardly requires yet another amateur opinion to bolster the claim that *Pinocchio* is probably the greatest film ever made by Walt Disney. Some have quibbled about the catch-as-catch-can plot (if Geppetto doesn't insist on sending the puppet to school, there would be no movie), or the lack of characterization (even Jiminy Cricket is more of a device than a fully integrated character). But such cavils are blown away by the absolute brilliance of the animation and the pathos of the situations.The early sequence in Geppetto's workshop, with the multitudinous, individualized cuckoo clocks (biergarten ladies in quaint caps, quacking ducks, an annoyed little wooden mom spanking her brat, and on and on -- all of them wheeling in and out of their respective clock portals) immediately sets the highest standard of what the art-form can accomplish. It is a symphony of pure delight. Another insightful reviewer here at IMDb beat me to the punch when he/she discussed the revolutionary achievement during the Monstro sequences. For the first time, physical scale is integrated within the spatial confines of the animated action: fancy words for basically saying that we never lose track of the immensity of the whale. Pinocchio and his family are insignificant gnats compared to the leviathan; and they remain gnats even during the high-speed sequence when Monstro is furiously intent on their destruction. The animation is as disciplined as it is revolutionary.It also may be a little too baroque for very young children. Parents, beware: a 3- to 4-year-old will likely be frightened by the whale scenes (that whale is really full of hate), to say nothing of the hallucinatory ""Pleasure Island"" sequence in its entirety. The misery-index is disturbingly high after the bad boys start turning into jackasses. The frightening score is emphatic; the suffering is not ameliorated. Indeed, as far as Walt is apparently concerned, these boys get exactly what they deserve, and they are shipped off to the circus or the salt mines . . . FOREVER. They are not rescued. Walt was never above using terror to drive home a moral. Be a good boy . . . or else. Let it also be noted that Honest John the Fox, his feline accomplice, and the scary Coachman (the most frankly evil character in the entire Disney canon) go unpunished. The world is a dark and dangerous place, so you had better let your conscience be your guide, pal.But the movie's darkness is easy to overstate. The virtues of family life provide a haven against the wolves snarling at the door. And in aesthetic terms, one has to merely witness the loving care that is lavished upon, for example, Figaro the kitten -- the thoroughly realistic bodily movement, the jealous but adoring feline temperament -- to come away from *Pinocchio* with the assurance that Life's dark underbelly will not hold sway with artists intent on bringing joy to our children.9 stars out of 10."
47,Pinocchio,10,3 August 2006,"one of the Disney classics, with as much delight as terror and abstract strengths","Such animation seems to be dwindling today when looking at- and thinking a lot about- Pinocchio, one of the real landmarks that Walt Disney ever produced. It might have not sparked up as much fascination when it was first released as Snow White and Dumbo did (apparently this and Fantasia did poorly on first release), but over time it's definitely got its place in the pantheon of truly wonderful works by the company. It tells a story that even babies can grasp- something that isn't really real that wants to be so for his creator. In fact, this is probably one of the most palatable stories for kids, about the dire straits of not just trying to fit in, but being a kid and still having to learn responsibilities, truth and courage. Of course, few kids will ever see their friends turn into donkeys or get thrown into the belly of a whale. But it's such out-of-this-world things that make the film so fantastic and terrifying in equal measure. It might lack the overall surreal whammy of Dumbo and Alice in Wonderland, yet in a small group of leaving a lasting impact Pinocchio has its unique bits.It's got about all that someone could ask for with an animated film, for kids and adults alike. It's got plenty of colorful side characters, both sweet and clumsy and goofy and smart (all taking up the animals like Figaro, the Goldfish, and especially the iconic Jiminy Cricket), as well as ignorant, villainous and evil (Lampwick, Stromboli and Honest John among others). All of these characters are so rich in their simple characterizations that the combination of the old vocal talents- meant more for direct style and appearance instead of star power like in todays animation- and the distinct look of each character, make them all compelling to one degree or another. Just thinking about the scenes with Stromboli, for example, make me think that there had to be someone that imposing and larger-than-life in appearance acting it out as opposed to just the drawing being that. Only the Blue Fairy is the bland type, drawn in the Snow White style. But then the rest of the picture- particularly for Pinocchio and Gepetto- is up for grabs with whatever can be done with them.So much emotion actually comes out of scenes. And it alternates very well, much as in fairy tales and other fantastical fiction. Pinocchio performs ""I've got no strings"" in one scene, which is one of the typical highlights, and then the next scene such sweetness gets contrasted with the defeat imposed by the evil Stromboli. What leaves the biggest impression, however, is Fantasy island, where all the boys who don't want to go to school go to, and soon enough (from Cricket's own words), become donkeys. I would probably rank that transformation scene of Lampwick's, by the way, as one of the top 5 scenes in any animated effort ever produced; it starts off kind of amusing, the way Pinocchio tries to put down the cigar, and then becomes like a child's true nightmare as we see his full-on transformation. It's an example of using abstractions that always work best in fairy tales, and somehow has become lost among the constant barrage of juvenile CGI films as of late. Seeing work like this again reminds one of the completeness given in well-rounded (if 2-dinemnsional) stories.It's got action, music, pomp and circumstance, countless chances at very goofy gags and silly puns, and somehow it all works just as well- if not better in a way- as an adult as when I was a kid. Is it cheesy at times and maybe here and there hitting points home a little hard? Sure. But I never had any dis-liking to the characters, never really felt that I was being cheated with motivations or in some kind of truth in the un-reality of it all. Not to sound cheesy myself, but it is a timeless kind of picture, with a story that when told well can strike a chord with just about anyone willing for the experience. It's old-fashioned sensibilities are still resonant, and the production values are all top-notch."
48,Pinocchio,10,21 May 2006,An Animation Masterpiece,"Recently, I resumed my goal to watch all of the Disney feature films. In particular, I wanted to be more familiar with the classics from Walt's time, and began mentally listing off the movies I hadn't seen or couldn't remember very well.Pinocchio was one of them.So, I popped down to the video store and rented the DVD. My goodness. I could not have been more impressed with it. There are so many 'perfect' moments in that movie. Truly Disney created animation magic like no other. The plot retained points from the book it was based on, but gave the main character a whole new demeanor. Naive and curious, Pinocchio repeatedly stumbles into trouble, while Jiminy Cricket, acting as his 'conscience', tries to keep him away from it by teaching him right from wrong. The mood and overall feel to the story is warm and very cozy, especially at the beginning, and you get used to it right away. The characters are filled with the charm Disney is known for.I could go on about the positive attributes to the atmosphere, but it goes so much deeper than that. Pinocchio differs from other Disney movies in the way that no villains are truly punished for their crimes. It's almost truthful, really. Not every crook pays for his wrong-doings.In addition, there are less than cheerful moments. The scene on Pleasure Island when Lampwick becomes a donkey is actually scary. The use of perspective is very clever on many occasions, and the whole movie is very atmospheric in some way or other. It somehow maintains the feel I got from the original book while giving the characters Disney sweetness. It's honestly worth a watch."
49,Pinocchio,10,14 March 2003,A true classic,"Three years after coming out with his greatest work ever, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", Walt Disney came out with another one of his greatest works, ""Pinocchio"".  This was the first movie I ever watched, and I must say it was the best; sure, there were better movies that I had seen, but none of them had the familiarity that Pinocchio gave to me.  It gave us a lesson, telling us that those who are good get rewarded.  It was also the film that introduced us to the world-famous Disney anthem, ""When You Wish Upon a Star.""  This film is yet another example of Disney at his finest.My score: 10 out of 10.  In stars, it's a 4-star film. ****"
50,Pinocchio,,28 October 2002,Truly an animated classic,"In my opinion, this is one of Disney's best animated films of all time. Take a look at all the brilliant background art and the effects, all done by hand.  I especially like the blurred vision of the eight ball that Pinocchio is trying to shoot after he inhales too much nicotine from his cigar.  The Disney animators were really good at giving emotional feeling to different scenes in the movie.  For example, the warm, fun, relaxing atmosphere of Gepetto's workshop contrasts greatly with the scary scene of Lampwick's transformation into a donkey at Pleasure Island.  I feel that this just isn't as good when done with computer and the films themselves were better back in those days.  Disney wasn't afraid of offending anyone or frightening children.  Do you think the donkey scene would be included if this movie had been produced today?  It is very doubtful, considering that Disney's films of today are beginning to look rather bland in their political correctness. If you have never seen this movie, I suggest you go buy it or rent it.  This is a classic that no Disney fan/animation buff should be without."
51,Pinocchio,10,30 March 2002,Top classic animated storytelling,"This is one on the most detailed and breathtaking animated films ever! I think what contributes to the richness of this film is the detailed thought in the storytelling. The best example of this is the characterization of Jiminy Cricket. In this version the cricket is someone who has been around a bit. He makes a good conscience cause he knows what to look out for. He sees through ""Honest John"" without any trouble, and he suspects Pleasure Island from the start, even if he doesn't know the secret behind it. He is not some two-dimensional puritanical moralist who just mouths brainless platitudes. He is allowed to have human characteristics (he has a massive crush on The Blue Fairy, and he is quite willing to try and duck out of trouble when he appears at fault as in the birdcage scene.) Compare that with say the 1990s version THE ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO; where the character just gives cute sayings.One of the most fascinating lines is when Jiminy says ""What does an actor want with a conscience anyway?"" after seeing Pinocchio's apparent success with Stromboli. It harks back to the old puritanical notion of acting being an inherently immoral profession, as summed up in the phrase ""Life upon the wicked stage""; and something which early Hollywood had no qualms in alluding to with their stories.It's just an example of the rich depth that a supposedly simplistic old children's film actually has."
52,Pinocchio,9,31 December 2014,What artistry!,"While I would not place ""Pinocchio"" among the very best feature- length films by Disney, it's sure close. The only reason I don't score this one a 10 is that around the same time, the Disney Studio made a few better films during this era--particularly ""Bambi"". So why am I so high on this film? Well, it's truly an artistic triumph. The backgrounds are gorgeous--with lots of detail that show that this was a labor of love. And, the animation of the characters is about as good as you can find. Together, they show that the studio had learned and progressed quite a bit since their first feature, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". And, the film also is possibly the best looking Disney film. But the story itself is the weakest part of the film. It's good but not great. Some of this is due to difficult to like characters (Pinocchio himself is an idiot when you think about it and Jimminy Cricket is a lousy conscience and does nothing to keep the puppet out of trouble) and a story that just doesn't reach your heart the way some of their other films would do. Exceptional nonetheless."
53,Pinocchio,10,23 April 2014,PINOCCHIO: Second in line but Top of the List,"While my personal favorite Disney feature is THE THREE CABALLEROS, I consider PINOCCHIO the greatest. This 1940 film is gracefully executed and dramatically powerful in its range of depicted emotions felt by on screen characters, as well as in how well (and how many of) those responses are evoked within viewers.I first saw PINOCCHIO at age seven. It wasn't even the first cartoon feature I ever watched; yet more than 50 years later, I still don't feel I have ever seen finer or more subtle character animation on film. For one quick example: the brief shot (during Gepetto's ""Little Woodenhead"" song) from Cleo's point of view, presenting the not-yet-living puppet being marched by strings toward her goldfish bowl. The visual distortion of Pinocchio's movement, as seen through both water and the glass bowl, is brilliantly rendered -- AND we immediately grasp why the distortion terrifies the tiny fish.By the time his studio created those features, Walt Disney was no longer contributing any of the physical artwork; but the films benefited from his detailed supervision and gift for story analysis. One studio history which I've read does quote Disney as having told one employee, as PINOCCHIO finally was completed, ""I will never work that hard again."" That declaration probably explains why PINOCCHIO was never equaled -- by Disney or by any other team."
54,Pinocchio,9,9 October 2013,Nostaglic Disney Classic!,"This is one of the full length animated feature films from Walt Disney that I grew up with - a great adaptation of the fairytale about the wooden puppet who came to life.There is great character development - each one treated with care: Pinocchio is an inquisitive and curious boy; Jiminy Cricket is a no-nonsense mentor of Pinocchio; Gepetto is gentle, kind-hearted woodcarver; the Blue Fairy is a beautiful force of goodness; and, of course, the devious J. Worthington Foulfellow and the evil Stromboli. The villains, not counting the freaky, yet incredibly well-executed monster whale, are the only issues I have in this movie. They were never really (SPOILER ahead) defeated.What I like most about this film is that it sends a powerful message of right and wrong, honesty, courage and faith. And, the music in this film is delightful and lively, and introduces what is probably Disney's signature song and most popular piece of music in the entire Disney genre: When You Wish Upon A Star.This movie is great fun from start to finish, perfect for the entire family.Grade A"
55,Pinocchio,9,31 July 2013,"""Pinocchio"" is a nice little boy, but Jiminy Cricket is no conscience","After releasing a film that took years to make and not knowing what the end result would be, many wondered what Walt Disney could possibly create next after his 1st full-length animated feature, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937). Well, Walt Disney started lining up more possible projects including more full-length animated features. He was considering many options for his second animated feature including ""Bambi"" (1942), ""Dumbo"" (1941), ""Alice in Wonderland"" (1951), ""Peter Pan"" (1953), and ""Fantasia"" (1940), all of which would become animated features later. Then, due to difficulties figuring out how to adapt the other stories to the big screen, Walt Disney finally decided for his 2nd animated feature to be ""Pinocchio"" (1940). This tale starts with a lonely wood carver named Gepetto finishing up on his newest marionette that he has called Pinocchio. He tells his two animal companions, a cat named Figaro and a fish named Cleo, that he wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy. One night, he gets his wish as a magical blue fairy brings this puppet to life. He isn't a real boy yet, but if he is able to prove his bravery, honesty and kindness, he will be one someday. Pinocchio is given a sidekick named Jiminy Cricket who will help him decide what's right or wrong and help make Gepetto proud. Now, Pinocchio is put to the test as he goes on many accidental misadventures such as becoming an actor, going to an island where you're allowed to do whatever you want (with a permanent price to pay, of course), and chasing down a monstrous whale. As was the case with Walt Disney's previous picture ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", ""Pinocchio"" is exceptionally well animated. The backgrounds are so painstakingly well detailed that you practically notice something new in the backgrounds every time you watch it. In terms of its visuals, it pushed the envelope for what animated films could do with lighting, color, and other unique visual techniques. The music by Leigh Harline, Ned Washington, and Paul Smith is also worth commenting on. I think it's safe to say that all of us know how immortal and timeless the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" is. I think that playing this song during the opening credits was genius, since it's the best way to draw the audience's attention at the start of a film like this which is surprisingly darker than you might remember it being. It's intriguing the way the story convinces us how wrong it is to do whatever Pinocchio is manipulated into doing. For example, when Pinocchio tells a lie about why he didn't go to school to the blue fairy, his nose keeps on growing whenever he tells lie after lie. Another noteworthy example is when Pinocchio is manipulated into going to Pleasure Island where young boys smoke cigars, drink beer, play pool and other frowned upon activities for kids to be doing. After too much time there, the kids transform into donkeys that will be taken to work at the salt mines. The reasons why they somehow turn into donkeys are surreal to say the least, but let's just say this scene will scare off kids from smoking and drinking.at least for a while. I could have done without a few scenes at the beginning, which were solely devoted to showing off the sound effects and the details in Gepetto's workshop as opposed to continue telling the story. I also thought that the ending to this film was sort of ripping off the ending from ""Snow White"" in a way that was less credible. If you've seen the ending to this film already, you'll know what plot device was used during that scene that I personally don't care for. Also, I have to agree with Internet video film critic Doug Walker (of the Nostalgia Critic fame) when he said that Jiminy Cricket doesn't hold up that well. While I agree that his sense of humor wasn't that good, I also thought Jiminy was way too careless, gave up too easily, and yet usually thinks he knows everything. There are more than a few scenes that show just how blatantly inconsistent his character is. Ultimately, what makes ""Pinocchio"" a great Disney movie more than 70 years after its initial release is the animation, the music, and the way it reinforces the main morals of its story onto its young audience. Even though Jiminy Cricket's somewhat good intentions backfired on me, I still liked Pinocchio himself. I admired how curious he was about the world around him, how positive his attitude was, and how clueless he was about what's good and what's bad. In other words, he felt like a real kid personality wise. This aspect and the ones I've mentioned before are good enough reasons why ""Pinocchio"" is a film that any Disney fan should take a look at."
56,Pinocchio,10,11 May 2011,Disney and company at their very best...,"Pinocchio:--- is the best animated film ever to come out of the Walt Disney studio, bar none, including the later Pixar division features. This is because of a great writer (Ted Sears, 1900-1958) they had at the time and because of Walt Disney who could recognize a good story. Ted Sears's source was a nearly forgotten periodical serial originally written in Italy by 19th Century children's fairy tale writer, Carlo Collodi. (Birth name, Carlo Lorenzini). Lorenzini wrote Storia di un burattino (""The story of a marionette""), Sears assembled the best stories from the serial first published in Il Giornale dei Bambini (The Children's Journal) the first periodical for children, and created the script for Pinocchio. This was a time when Disney, still working on Snow White but seeing what was about to manifest in the world, pulled out all the stops and with his top flight, hand selected staff that included today's well-known animation artist's names, created Pinocchio. Fortunately, Walt Disney wisely refused to use well-known voices of the period so the characters remain freshly unfettered by latent image conflicts with real life images.Popular artist, Thomas Kinkaid, recognized the perennial greatness of this film and followed his Snow White painting with one the Pinocchio. That painting will be important as long as the film remains popular...for at least one hundred years or more from today. The painting consists of and depicts every major scene and character in the film.//Raúl daSilva, author, first place national book festival prizewinner, The World of animation (Kodak, 1979)."
57,Pinocchio,10,2 March 2010,Just Incredible-This is the star where dreams came true,"If people say this film is bad, then they don't know the meaning of bad. Luckily Pinocchio seems to loved by nearly everyone, and of course this incredible movie deserves that! Seriously, have you seen a better movie to make you think about what temptation does and that there are wishes that seem to come true? I don't think so! Pinocchio is the tale of wooden puppet boy who is brought to life, and has to prove himself to be brave, truthful and unselfish to become a real boy, with the help of his ""conscience"", Jiminy Cricket. It's based from Carlo Collodi's novel,only with a LOT of changes, but the changes are for better. Walt Disney turned Collodi's arrogant and rude puppet into a sweet, funny little guy who just has trouble seeing what's right and wrong.'Pinocchio' has outstanding songs, such as 'Give A Little Whistle' to the legendary 'When You Wish Upon A Star'. The voice work is extremely well done. Every moment of the movie is magical.It has funny scenes such as Geppetto playing with wooden Pinocchio with strings(Little Wooden Head), to even frightening scenes, such as the boys turning into Donkeys.'Pinocchio' is one of the most enchanting Disney movies of all time, it is a pleasure to watch and if Walt Disney had never made it, I simply don't know what the world of movies would be like.I'd say this is the star where dreams come true."
58,Pinocchio,10,25 February 2009,When You Wish Upon a Star!,"This is a beautiful movie, not as good as Snow white and Bambi, but it is right up there with the classics. The animation is flawless, and I loved how they animated the Blue Fairy. She was beautiful! The songs are absolutely magnificent, the best being ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", which strangely reminds me of Christmas and never fails to bring tears to my eyes. The characters are unforgettable, and what a talented voice cast to bring Carlo Collodi's characters to life. Pinocchio is appealing enough, and Geopetto was inspiring. Figaro was really funny, although he never speaks,but his facial expressions are priceless, and Jiminy Cricket is my favourite character. Honest John and his feline sidekick were also great fun, as well as the cruel Stromboli. And I mustn't forget the terrifying Monstro the whale-and the coachman(prepare for nightmares)- who reminds me of a larger version of Jaws the Shark. Another scene that scared me was the donkey transformation. Watch this movie, because it is so relaxing to watch and a timeless Disney masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
59,Pinocchio,8,21 October 2008,Early Disney magic.,"This is one of the fist feature length Disney animated movies and after all those years it also still is among one of the most classic and adorable ones.""Pinocchio"" is a real adorable movie to watch, mostly due to its likable characters. Basically every character within this movie is a great and classic one. I especially really liked the truly adorable little kitten Figaro. But of course also the Pinocchio character himself is a real classic and one of the most adorable ones ever created by Disney. I mean, whenever you hear the name Pinocchio you immediately think about the Disney Pinocchio don't you? But besides Pinocchio also Jiminy Cricket and Geppetto have grown into becoming some real classic characters.The movie its first halve is mostly fun and cheerful and features some nice comical moments as well. The second halve of the movie is more dark of tone and a bit more serous, though the movie luckily never looses its sense of fun and entertainment.I never really have been a too big fan of the movie its second halve. Probably because its too dark and serious of tone. Especially the movie its final part with Monstro doesn't really feel quite consistent with the rest of the movie. The first halve is mostly light and fun and enjoyable as you would expected from a Disney movie. But then again all earliest Disney movies have some more heavy and serious elements in it. Just look at the first ever long Disney animated movie ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" which was actually quite dark at the times and even a bit horror like. Same also goes for ""Pinocchio"". In all honesty, as weird as it might sound, but no way Disney would make an animated movie such as this one again. It's simply too scary and serious in parts.It's quite strange but the entire story in general actually doesn't connect well. I mean right the next day after Pinnochio had been brought to life by the Blue Fairy, Geppetto sends him to school and the movie is filled with story elements like that. The story often makes some very sudden leaps and there actually is very little interaction between Pinocchio and his 'father' Geppetto. Yet there relationship and basically everything else within this movie works out so well. It's simply Disney magic and these 'old' Disney movies just basically can do no wrong for me.Perhaps the only problem I have with these 'old' early Disney movies is its voice cast. While watching this movie again lately I couldn't help wondering of the movie actually wouldn't had been a better one if it had used some more well known actors to provide the movie its characters with their voices. It's probably because 'voice-actor' wasn't a real profession yet at the time and cartoons were not something credible enough to lend your voice to that the early Disney movies often use some unknown actors. It really sounds as if they were simply picked off the street and I truly feel that some big acting names could had brought the movie to an even higher level.The animations, as always, look good and it actually is impressive to watch these 'old' Disney animated then the newer ones, knowing how basic this movies got made, without the help of computers and anything like that. It's some real authentic craftsmanship and it also in no way looks outdated now days.It's also an early Disney movie to feature more than a couple of songs in it, though they are actually only present in the movie its first halve. The songs are all quite nice, of which 'When You Wish Upon A Star', performed by Cliff Edwards, is of course the most classic and memorable one.A real early Disney classic and still perfectly watchable to everyone, after all those years.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
60,Pinocchio,10,30 July 2006,"""When you wish upon a star...""","From the animation division of Walt Disney comes that movie so classic, everyone knows the story quite well and it lives forever in their minds, ""Pinocchio."" Released in 1940, it's the fairy tale movie about a carpenter who made this toy wooden doll puppet. Suddenly, magic brought the doll to life. However, for every lie the magical puppet told, his nose would get bigger and bigger!What I like about this film: 1. Unlike the rubbish the Disney company puts out today (with few exceptions!), this movie was fantastic! It is safe and funny! 2. It told us lessons! This movie had taught children through time that lying is bad and it shouldn't be done! (Hey, Clinton, were you even paying attention? No offense.) 3. This is typical Disney fun! 4. The song, ""When you wish upon a star"" became so famous that we hear this on the ""Where are you going next? Disney World!"" commercials!""Pinocchio"" is one of the great wonders of the Disney world. Go rent it; your kids will love it, don't watch the cheap imitations of this film! 10 stars."
61,Pinocchio,10,5 January 2006,Greatest and most memorable movie of my childhood..,"I love this movie. Needless to say, I hadn't seen it in ages, but from what I remember, it was wonderful. The reason that this film is so great is that it contains all the makings of a good film, a few laughs, some sentimental moments, a plethora of funny characters, and a moral which few films can parallel. I recall that this film was on of the first which I had the pleasure of watching as a kid, and that therewere certain moments which brought tears of laughter to my eyes, and some which had me frightened stiff, and still others which had me puzzled, but I would not soon forget such a wonderful film with great moments which I would not forget for years and some moments which I would say that were simply smashing. The plot is that of a puppet brought to life who wishes to be a real boy and must first deem himself worthy of such a request. With songs that were full of whimsy and unforgettable moments, this film will go down in history as one of the greatest animated stories ever told."
62,Pinocchio,10,2 March 2000,A hallmark masterpiece of animation.,"Pinocchio is easily one of the most powerful, complex, layered children's fables ever captured onscreen.  It has lost none of it's ability to impress 60 years after it was first released, with its charming big hearted characters, masterful animation and and unforgettable music.  This version of the mythic poetic tale is the definitive screen realization, a film that could only be fully realized as illustrated by the brilliant cartoonists at Disney.  The modern films pale by comparison.  Overproduced and formulaic, they do not even come close to touching the natural charm of this handcrafted gem.  There is no superlative strong enough to describe Pinnochio.  Quite possibly the greatest animated feature ever, it ranks with The Wizard of Oz and E.T. as one of the greatest children's films of all time.  A MUST SEE!"
63,Pinocchio,9,5 July 2016,A film that passes through several generations,"Pinocchio is a puppet who, magically, came to life, but it needs the help of Jiminy Cricket to avoid doing bad things. This is one of the most famous earlier films from Disney Studios, inspired by the Italian fable of Carlo Collodi and adapted by Ted. Sears. The direction was in charge of Norman Ferguson's team.This is an important piece of culture, more than just an animated film. Even today, Pinocchio's lies are part of the collective popular imagination, and its not rare to see it applied in other contexts, such as in the protests against government or one of its ministers. Its also not uncommon to hear comparisons between Jiminy Cricket and anyone notable for responsibility and seriousness. The script of this film doesn't portray faithfully the tale of Collodi, but recreates it and rewrites it, giving it a much more didactic and educational aspect. That makes this movie a very good help for parents in their task, always thorny, of educate.The work of the voices is very good and drawings, made the old fashioned way, show us some of the most interesting scenes of the early films of this iconic studio. The use of color was done intelligently. The songs are excellent, some of them have become unmistakable. Pinocchio is, today as it was for decades, one of the compelling films of childhood of many grandparents, parents, children and grandchildren, passing from generation to generation."
64,Pinocchio,7,27 June 2016,This a great Disney movie,"I think that this is one of the best ones for kids to watch. It teaches kids a lot. When Pinocchio's nose grows it teaches kids that lying is wrong. The part to where all the boys cause trouble and they turn into donkeys teaches kids that when they are bad they get consequences. I like the set of the movie and how it takes place in Italy. I like the song about letting your conscious be your mind. This whole movie teaches about your conscious and about the consequences of life. This is a movie that every kid should watch, it teaches them a lot. Jemeny Cricket is the big role model in this movie. He teaches Pinocchio to be good and to be honest. I recommend this movie to all families and kids."
65,Pinocchio,,30 May 2015,Very dark but thrilling children's film,"Pinocchio is only the second feature-length film Walt Disney Studios had ever produced and by many accounts considered the crowning achievement of their career by Walt Disney himself. And it's easy to see why. It's a stunningly beautiful film. Everything from the fluidity of movement to the facial expressions to the softness of colours to the amazingly detailed backgrounds speaks of hundreds of hours of loving toil and attention to detail. The whale scene alone, with water splashing everywhere, each and every droplet of seawater drawn and animated by hand. It's bewildering to imagine them doing this.And, like it predecessor Snow White, it has held up remarkably well as a story as well. You can still see some of the episodic nature of the animated shorties in it, but not as much as in Snow White. The scenes flow from one to another rather hurriedly and sometimes the plot loses you in time, but the story itself is always moving forward. Every scene is extremely memorable and for many people this is the film that has stuck with them from their childhood. Partly because a good chunk of the scenes are startlingly dark for a film aimed primarily for children, and partly because of the quality of the characters and the story.Pinocchio is one of those films you like as a child, but which you will grow to love as an adult. As an adult your attention is drawn to the gorgeousness of the art and you can appreciate even the darkest moments because they make the ending shine even brighter in comparison. A film most have already seen, but if you haven't seen this Disney gem yet, do yourself a favour. No matter what your age might be."
66,Pinocchio,10,26 December 2014,A delightful animated morality tale,"This Disney classic tells the story of Pinocchio a marionette made by Geppetto. Having finished making the doll Geppetto settles down to sleep and wishes that Pinocchio could be a real boy. As he sleeps a fairy grants his wish. As Pinocchio wakes the fairy tells him that while he is alive he is not yet a real boy; to do that he must prove himself ""brave, truthful, and unselfish"". To help him Jiminy Cricket, the cricket who is also the story's narrator, is appointed his conscience. Not surprisingly Geppetto is rather surprised but he is also happy. The next day he sends Pinocchio to school but along the way he meets two dubious characters who persuade him forget about going to school and instead join a puppet show where he is to be the star attraction. Inevitably it does not end well but Jiminy and the fairy rescue him. One would think that Pinocchio would learn his lesson but soon he is being tempted again; this time to somewhere even more dangerous. Once again he is rescued by Jiminy and they head home once more; when they get there they learn Geppetto has gone looking for him and got in trouble it is now time for Pinocchio to be ""brave, truthful, and unselfish"".I believe this was the first film I ever saw in the cinema; and I hadn't seen it since then. For that reason alone I had to watch it when it was on television. I'm over forty years older now but still found the film delightful. The story is obviously a morality tale as Pinocchio it tempted but ultimately proves himself; this isn't done in a heavy-handed way at the expense of viewers' enjoyment. There are plenty of child-friendly scares and some genuinely dark moments the bad children aren't saved from their fate of being turned to donkeys and force to work in the salt mines! The animation is absolutely stunning; it is amazing to think that this was made in an era when animation was entirely hand drawn with; the use of shadows and the scenes involving the whale and the foaming sea were particularly spectacular. Overall this film certainly deserves its classic status; it is a must see for fans of Disney and animation in general."
67,Pinocchio,7,15 October 2014,An alternately very frightening and heartbreaking movie,"This is a strange movie. I can't imagine children enjoying it at all. The first part deals with repeated efforts to kidnap a child and take him away from his loving father. Then there are the very frightening scenes with the whale, during which it seems that Gipetto will be lost, or then Pinocchio.Yes, the artwork is very good. Not with the magic of Bambi or Fantasia, but certainly very good.And yes, there is a very clear moral here: children should go to school and not play hooky.But the punishment for playing hooky - first, being kidnapped by ""Honest Joe"" and sold to an itinerant puppeteer, then being sold to a strange coachman who lures boys to an island of corruption so that he can turn them into donkeys to be sold in the salt mines - is frightening out of all proportion.Yes, certainly, Bambi also rips your heart out, when the young deer loses his mother. Disney dealt with very basic, raw childhood fears back in the 1940s, in a way that I can't imagine any animated movie for children doing today. But even Bambi is not as constantly menacing as this.There are lots of good songs in this movie, capped by the magical When you wish upon a star, sung magically by Cliff Edwards. The movie certainly deserved its two Oscars for Best Score and Best Song.But this is a deeply disturbing, frightening movie. And I'm no child."
68,Pinocchio,9,12 April 2013,2nd out of the 5 in the Golden Era,"Released over two years after Snow White, Pinocchio is not only as good as Disney's first, but it surpasses it.The story is about a marionette puppet that comes to life after the Fairy grants his father Gepetto's wish for Pinocchip to become a real boy. He has to prove the Fairy that he can be a real boy by being honest and selflessThe characters in this film are less one-dimensional than the characters in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Pinocchio is an actual boy; he makes mistakes, he lies sometimes, and he sometimes wants to be bad, but he still wants to overall do the right thing. Jiminy Cricket is an alright sidekick, and Gepetto is such a happy, joyful character. You could tell Pinocchio brought him a lot of happiness. The cat, fish, and fairy are all enjoyable, delightful characters. The animation has improved as well since Snow White, and the filler scenes are reduced. The plot is well paced, and it is so funny when Pinocchio's nose grows every time he lies.The story is not very close to the original book, since the book is very dark and twisted, but no one expects an exact adaption to the book.The songs are very great. It's signature song ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" is also Disney's anthem. The song ""I've Got No Strings"" is pretty good as well.This film can appeal to both children and adults, and is very strong. It is definitely one of Disney's best films. Perfect entertainment."
69,Pinocchio,8,7 April 2013,An Unforgettable Masterpiece,"""I've got no strings to hold me..."" Oops, sorry, I was having a moment there. As one of Disney's earliest films, the artistry here is so incredible you'd assume he had been churning them out for years. How could you not love the titular marionette and his faithful insect companion? Who wouldn't be scared stiff of the naughty boys turning into Jackasses on Pleasure Island? Why would you not be wowed at the ginormus whale Monstro chasing our heroes in a spectacular sequence? And anybody who doesn't find their foot tapping to the lovely songs (As ably demonstrated by my dulcet tones) officially has no soul.It's just a beautiful movie that will be appreciated for generations to come, and anyone who thinks it's just for kids would do well to pay attention to the lessons about honesty and loyalty contained within. Of course it's a lot of fun as well... Notice the hilarious clocks in Geppetto's cottage at the start. And of course there's the music... Oh dear, it's set me off again... ""When you wish upon a staarr..."". 8/10"
70,Pinocchio,8,13 September 2012,Pinocchio (1940),"Pinocchio is the classic tale of a lonely man without a child that builds himself a wooden puppet. The puppet comes alive but wishes to be a real boy. A lot of Disney's best work still holds up today. Pinocchio is an episodic but delightfully twisted film. It's basically a fable on how to choose between right from wrong but who cares when it has some scenes worthy of the best horror films. Pleasure Island is a twisted and terrifying place. The donkey's screaming is very disturbing, as is Lampwick's. He may be a jackass but he is still a little boy with a mother. Like many fairy tales movies adapted from books it's a bit jumpy, but at least this keeps the pace going.The morals are surprisingly strong and hold up today. The kids on Pleasure Island are a lot like actual children today, with drinking and smoking. It also shows a strong, single father relationship."
71,Pinocchio,9,20 October 2011,Great film!,"I'll keep this short and to the point. Pinocchio seemed to deliver the goods in every aspect. The music was great and certainly enhanced the mood and scene, music composer did a fantastic job with the instrumental score. The characterisation was done quite well, and you could really sense the strong friendship that Pinocchio had with one another. Groucho was also a character favorite of mine, and the actor did a great job providing her voice! The artwork was also exceptionally good, with the colorful Mayan themes and designs providing an amazing backdrop for the story. Of course the film is not without its fair share of eye-candy, the special effects were excellent and Disney didn't go overboard with them. The story was also a nice change. For once it wasn't the tired, rigid old formula of ""good guys meet bad guys, conflict, defeat bad guys and everyone's happy"". I mean..sure everyone is happy in the end...and there is the token good guy VS bad guy routine but Disney seemed to mince it up somewhat and introduce all-new elements.Surely it has its flaws, you say. Well in all honesty, I'm hard pressed coming up with any. I didn't exactly love the character design for Pinocchio but that's just being incredibly petty....All in all, Pinocchio was very refreshing and a welcome change from the usual Disney-formula-based feature. As for comparisons and similarities with the ""brilliance of Disney"", I believe that there is no need for that talk."
72,Pinocchio,9,19 September 2011,A timeless classic !,"Pinoochio is a fantastic animated movie,its heartwarming with beautiful music and a lovable cast of characters,the animation of the movie was definitely an outstanding movie for its time,especially the scene with Montro the whale trying to eat everything,the way all the waves look is truly mazing and still looks incredible today.A puppet maker named Geppetto who lives alone with his cat and fish wishes for his puppet to become a real boy,overnight the wish comes true from a magic fairy,but he isn't officially a real boy yet until he can prove that he can be,he has conscience named Jiminy Cricket keeping an eye on him and every time he lies his nose grows,but this doesn't stop Pinoochio from being fooled."
73,Pinocchio,8,12 November 2009,Simply a star,"Despite not beating Snow White, Pinocchio is just an amazing Disney film.I just love the songs they are so memorable! The voices are just perfect for the characters! It's dramatic at parts, touching, and even funny at times! Anybody who hasn't watched it and is a serious Disney fan, seriously, watch it. It's just great.Also, 'Pinocchio' even teaches kids a lesson: Lieing and temptation is wrong, and can get you in a big problem. I have gave the film 8/10, since even though it's not the best Disney film, it is certainly worth watching and enjoyable. Just brilliant. Simply a star. Defiently a film worth watching."
74,Pinocchio,8,22 August 2008,Always let your conscience be your guide.,"Following the overwhelming success of the studio's first full-length animated feature, Snow White in 1937, Disney set out to make an even better follow up. Years in the making, Pinocchio is still considered to be one of the company's finest achievements for its production value, charm, beauty and Academy Award-winning music. Technicians developed an enhanced multiplane camera that could dolly in and out of an animated scene (similar to live-action photography), as opposed to Snow White's vertical method of shooting.A lonely woodcarver named Geppetto creates a marionette he names Pinocchio. That night he prays upon a star that puppet would become a real boy. The good Blue Fairy hears his wish and brings Pinocchio to life while Gepettto sleeps. She then tells the little wooden fellow that he can become a real boy if he is brave, truthful and unselfish and learns to tell right from wrong. She appoints Jimimy Cricket (the narrator of our story) as Pinocchio's conscience to help him along the way. The overjoyed Gepetto sends his new son to school the next day, but the newness of everything overwhelms the boy and he is soon led astray on a series of frightening adventures."
75,Pinocchio,,2 April 2006,Great masterpiece,"Pinocchio/1940/***1/2Main Stars:Dickie JonesCliff EdwardsChristian Rub I have to say that ""Pinocchio"" (Music by Leigh Harline, Paul J. Smith, and Edward H. Plumb) could be a little better or longer (just like ""Aladdin"") than it was. But it was still a classic and it won two Oscars. ""Pinocchio"" is one of the most famous tales of a wooden doll that wants to become a REAL boy. Of course, there are more details but I won't explain them to you now. I know you've seen this movie so you and I know all the scenes already and Pinocchio does become a real boy at the end and the ending is like a usual ending of a classic Disney film; the orchestra plays this real huge ending theme or musical score. Sometimes it could get annoying but some of it fits like ""The Wizard of Oz"" for example (Music by George Bassman, George E. Stoll, and Robert W. Stringer) or ""Beauty and the Beast."" (Music by Alan Menken: Oscar winner). You might think that those movies I mentioned are for old people or really young kids and not for teenagers. But actually anyone could like it at any age. I myself don't mind ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"" because I thought the acting wasn't bad (""Beauty and the Beast"") and there was some humor involving Gaston (Richard White) and his short roly-poly sidekick- Lefou (Jesse Corti). I could go on but I have to get back to the movie I'm supposed to be reviewing, ""Pinocchio."" For very few of you that haven't seen this movie, I can tell you this: it was good, quirky (very), and worth 88 minutes out of your day. Movie directed by Hamilton Luske and Ben Sharpsteen."
76,Pinocchio,9,29 August 2016,The best lesson a child can learn,"While ""Pinocchio"" might not be as challenging for children as other animated movies, it does have some great lessons to teach them. It's more of a cautionary tale than anything, about choices and the consequences of those choices. It starts off pretty innocent, just a carpenter wanting a son, but about 40 minutes in the movie takes a complete 180 tone-wise. The movie goes from lighthearted to creepy in an instant. I want to say the last time I saw this was when I was 5, and the only thing that stuck with me all these years was Lampwick getting turned into a donkey. Is that scene still creepy to me now, yes, but I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be. Scenes like that, Stromboli locking Pinocchio in a cage, the Coachman sending children to salt mines, and the Monstro chase during the climax can all be pretty scary for a kid. But much like ""Watership Down"", I think the goal of scenes like these were to teach the viewer something, not solely to scare them. It all circles back to consequences of your actions, and that is one of, if not THE most important lesson a child can be taught. The movie doesn't sugarcoat things too much, aside from it being animated, the movie's rather dark. I definitely recommend you show this to your children, but wait till they're about 8 or so. Not so young that the scarier moments will scar them, but old enough to understand the movie's message."
77,Pinocchio,10,7 July 2008,"A Rose by any Other Name Smells just as Sweet; Ergo, a Monster is a Monster and a Horse is a Horse! Of Course, Of Course!","EVERY one of the Great Walt Disney Animated Features is loaded with plenty of mirth, beauty, music, messages (morales) and valuable life lessons. They also all have that one most horrifying incident that could well scare the living daylights out of the kiddies in attendance. And remember, loyal readers, these youngsters are supposed to be the very backbone of the Disney Audience; if indeed not the very reason for having had (past tense*) such a company as WDP.SOME fine examples of this dramatic device immediately come to mind. Starting with their first venture into the full-length Animated Film, it was a standard and, obviously, a highly needed element to making for a balanced and intelligent story.AND that very first, ground breaking, ice melting, trend setting, fad starting, genre creating and funny bone-tickling animated feature film, SNOW WHITE AND THE 7 DWARFS (Walt Disney Productions/ RKO Radio Pictures, 1937) featured a classic example in the transformation of the Queen into the hideous old Witch Hag. We also were treated to the notion of the Wicked Queen's order to her hunter to kill Snow White and bring her heart back as proof of his obedience, the over eager pair of vultures following the Witch-Queen and the reaction of Miss Snow to the spell laden, poisoned apple.MOVING along swiftly, we can cite such horrific incidents in subsequent pictures as: FANTASIA (Walt Disney/RKO, 1940)-the Night On Bald Mountain-Ave Maria Sequence, DUMBO (Walt Disney/RKO, 1941)-Dumbo's Mother being chained, imprisoned and separated from the little pachyderm, BAMBI (Walt Disney/RKO, 1942)- Bambi's Mother killed by hunters, THE ADVENTURES OF ICHABOD & MR. TOAD (Disney/RKO, 1949)-Sleepy Hollow sequence with the Headless Horseman, LADY AND THE TRAMP (Walt Disney Productions/Buena Vista Releasing Company, 1954)-Trusty's being run over by the Wagon, and even THE JUNGLE BOOK (Disney/Buena Vista, 1967)-Balu's seemingly mortal wounds after fighting Tiger.THERE were others, of course.AS for PINNOCCHIO, the horrifying element is one that has a great effect on this writer when he saw it at approximately 8 years old was the ""Pleasure Island ""scenes in which the foolish boys are led down the primrose path to the tender trap of drinking beer, smoking cigars and shooting pool; all the while they're duped into thinking that this is such a smart behavioural path. Before long, and too late for them to realize it, the young wise-guy wannabees are being transformed into Donkeys, being rounded up for shipment and life long service in the salt mines! THIS is perhaps the highest use of the Horrific Moment Syndrome; for there is a real morale with this one. On the strictly literal level, all in the audience know that schoolboys' drinking beer and smoking stogies; while patronizing a pool hall is a bad idea. While the transformation into Donkeys is astounding, disturbing and a great attention getter; it is, all things considered, a fantastic occurrence and not even plausible to a child.NOW, as a sort of parable or fable, it is quite a different story. As a metaphor for life, ""Pleasure Island"" represents all of the temptation that one encounters on our journey through life. The free beer, plentiful cigars, the Pool Hall and all of the carnival-like attractions we see are representative of how we can waste our time away from schooling and pursuing helpful, wholesome and productive pursuits; until it is too late and we are barred from achieving higher stations in life and work. We are in danger of becoming figurative ""Donkeys labouring in the Salt Mines."" AS for the rest of the production, it is an absolute delight. The characters, the scenery, the music and the trouble that the little Wooden Boy gets into are all amusing and make for the proverbial ""Never a Dull Moment."" The songs are all very good and all were fit well into the storyline. Highlights from the Musical Part of the movie are the immortal ""When You Wish Upon A Star""(an Academy Award Winner?), sung by Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket; and the bouncy and energetic ""Hi Diddle Dee-Dee""; which led the animated wooden doll to slave conditions as prisoner of the mean, old Gypsy Puppeteer, Stromboli. (Hey, that itself is another sort of minor horrific sequence! No?) THAT we have had a long standing axiom that there are only a limited number of plots (No Schultz, not ""plotz""!), is pretty much a universally accepted belief. Variations on a small number of scenarios account for just about any and every story that we can think of. So, just what does this mean for the tale of the ""Little Wooden Head"" (another of the lesser songs)? OUR theory may shock you, it may scare you, it may even horrify you; for you see we see PINNOCCHIO, either as written by Carlo Collodi** or as rendered by Mr. Disney and crew is after all a variation on the same theme as Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' and the long line of Universal Pictures Horror Flicks! Just you think about it! NOTE * We're pretty sure that old Walt wouldn't approve of a lot of the sh*t that they put out under some of their subsidiary companies' names.NOTE: ** I guess it must have been just pure ignorance, but it was many a year that had gone by before I realized that Pinnocchio is an Italian story, by an Italian author set in (where else?) Italy. Apologies to all of our Italian Buddies! POODLE SCHNITZ!!"
78,Pinocchio,7,20 February 2006,Bill Peet was uncredited contributor to Pinocchio,"My son just read ""Bill Peet An Autobiography"". In pages 95-108, Peet describes his involvement in Pinocchio, as well as his disappointment that the long list of screen credits didn't include his name. According to Peet's account, he did the storyboard for the Bogeyland sequence, which was ultimately cut from the film. After that, he remained on the Pinocchio staff for another year and a half, sketching for many story men working on nearly every section of the story. His sketches influenced the final versions of some of the characters, and some of Peet's ideas were incorporated into the story.From a look at his career, Peet was one of the main writers for several of Disney's most beloved animated films (The Jungle Book, 101 Dalmations, Cinderella, Dumbo, Peter Pan, and several others)."
79,Pinocchio,,13 May 2002,DISNEY'S MASTERPIECE,"The  greatness of  Walt  Disney's  second  full -length  animated feature  cannot  be  over estimated. Suffice to say  that the groundbreaking  acheivement of  SNOW  WHITE  AND  THE SEVEN  DWARFS  a  few  years  earlier  came  to  full  fruition  with PINNOCHIO. No  other  animated  feature  has  blended storytelling, imagery, music  and  sound as  successfully  as PINNOCHIO, and  despite  the  advances  in  contemporary computer  animation, the  more  recent  Disney  and  Dreamworks creations  don't  hold a  candle to  what  "" Uncle  Walt ""  and  his artisans  created  over  60  years  ago. '"
80,Pinocchio,10,10 January 2000,My Favorite Disney,"Pinocchio is the most developed of Disney's classic animated films.  The artwork, character design, narrative, and plotting all work perfectly.  The film is much more adult than the modern Disney tales.  Many of the things in it are quite frightening, especially the sequence where the boys turn into jackasses.  The temptations that the young wooden boy faces are as realistic as any in a Martin Scorese movie.  It is an excellent allegory for growing up and taking moral responsibility for one's actions.  Even with all of the advanced material that it contains, it still appeals perfectly to children. Walt Disney was an almost unmatched genius when it came to presenting enlightening entertainment to children.  I cannot imagine the world of animation without this film."
81,Pinocchio,10,30 December 2017,"When You Wish Upon a Star, This Happens","In the 77 years that it's been around, Pinocchio still stands the test of time as not just one of the greatest animated Disney films, but one of the greatest animated films of all time. While it's easy to understand why this film remains a classic, it's most important to understand the roots for its main song, which has become the national anthem for the Walt Disney Company.When You Wish Upon a Star is not simply a hauntingly heartwarming melody on its own, but it is also a very important message to those who dream. Although obviously metaphorical (I mean a wish isn't granted just like that), the general idea that it just might is a splendidly happy dream altogether. Everyone has their own dreams and aspirations, and as long as they give the right amount of dedication their dream deserves, then they'll accomplish wonders and earn said goal. Walt Disney himself said it best, ""If you can dream it, you can do it."", which perfectly coincides to what the titular character went through to become a real boy.Originally, Pinocchio was supposed to be arrogant and cocky like in the original book this film was based on, but I'm glad they went with the decision to make him more innocent and oddball. When you're a child, you learn the world at your own pace, so the dangers and obstacles Pinocchio encounters are a frightening but vital lesson to understand what's right and wrong in the world. Although Jimmy Cricket isn't the best conscience, he still does his best to keep Pinocchio out of harm's way so the wooden boy can improve and get better overtime. I'm sure at the end of the day, we all want to improve from our mistakes, but we must remember said mistakes so we can have a better knowledge on life. That way we really can prove how loyal and good we are, not unlike Pinocchio.From a technical standpoint, the animation is fantastic for its time, and it still looks breathtaking to this day. Along with fluid and upbeat character animation, the colors are nothing short of eye candy, the backgrounds have a very rich European aesthetic to them, and the effects are so well designed that it's hard to imagine how they crafted them. The use of the multiplane camera is another highlight, as the backgrounds move in a more realistic and brisk pace that gives each piece of art a chance to be seen and judged on its own merits.The characters are also charming and lovable, from the kind hearted albeit absent minded Geppetto, to the deliciously malicious Honest John and Gideon, to the adorable Figaro and Cleo. Whether they be supporters or obstacles for Pinocchio, they all fit the story well enough to drive the film along. However, the villains are another story, as unlike most Disney films, they don't get outsmarted by the protagonists and end up getting away with their crimes. This presents them in a more realistic manner and it's not hard to feel disturbed by their actions. Not to mention, the voice-acting is splendid and each actor gives just the right amount of spunk, personality and even relatability to keep the audience entertained and invested. While many animated Disney films like Snow White, Beauty & the Beast, Fantasia, The Lion King and Zootopia definitely deserve the acclaim they've received, I think Pinocchio will forever be the companies' crowning achievement. The message to follow your dreams while doing your best to be a better person has become a key message for Disney, and considering they are the company where dreams (supposedly) come true, it fits the bill superbly. So definitely have fun with this movie, but also remember how important it is to believe in your dreams so that one day they might come true, and it starts with you getting there."
82,Pinocchio,10,20 August 2017,When you wish upon a star you get Pinocchio.,"Pinocchio is probably not one of my favorite Disney movies, but it has a special place in my heart. It has one the most visually pleasing scenes in any Disney animated movie. It is when Jiminy comes to Gepetto's house and sees all the different clocks there. I just find it so beautifully detailed and pleasantly colourful. The time Pinocchio spends on Pleasure Island is also a special moment to me, because I was frightened by the sight of Lampwick turning into a donkey and later when we get to see all the other boys' fates. A landmark in animation and a timeless classic to be enjoyed by everyone even 77 years later. Of the earliest Disney animated movies, Pinocchio and Dumbo share the place as my favorite."
83,Pinocchio,10,13 August 2017,THE Animation Masterpiece: PINOCCHIO,"PINOCCHIO is the most complex animated feature I have ever watched. It is a very adult movie under cover of a child's movie. Dialogue is of the highest quality and it has a message about the pitfalls of trusting bad company, mendacity, and a few other sins, and how the reverse, courage and nobility of spirit, can make all the difference, with the symbolism of Pinocchio becoming a ""real boy"" by the movie's end.Direction has not been more assured in any movie, animated or otherwise. Photography is to die for, absolutely exquisite. The detail is astonishing, beginning with all the clocks in the introduction, and the outstanding scene of Pinocchio coming up to the fish bowl but with the glass distortion he might as well have been in front of one of those mirrors at fairs, where you alternately become tall, short, or fat. The attention to detail is beyond compare but the finest item of all is the animation, which remains peerless today, all the CGI and other computer-related technology progresses notwithstanding. It is a work of genius, without a shot or a second to spare, the nearest thing to perfection, blending humor with deeply frightening sequences such as Pleasure Island, Monstro, and the climax, with Pinocchio dead but about to be resuscitated because he earned it. In the process, it has been a road trip in which a wooden toy has become a full human being.I have watched Pinocchio more times than I can recall, and every time I do so, there is a new detail, a new beautiful scene to be savored, and it reminds of how lucky I am to be able to see it while most of mankind has never set eyes on it, and probably does not even know of its existence. 10/10"
84,Pinocchio,,11 August 2017,"Landmark Disney animated film, released on BluRay.","I watched this at home on my public library's copy of the BluRay release of this 1940 movie. Of course the picture and sound are perfect and there are a few interesting extras, my favorite is a 4-minute one of a 1956 interview with Walt, describing his approach to the Disney empire.I grew up in the 1950s and as a boy likely saw this movie but frankly don't remember for sure. My only lasting memory over the years was that Pinocchio's nose would grow longer if he told a lie. Other than that the story was fresh to me. Pinocchio was animated, could speak, but was still a wooden boy. Only if he did something unselfish and heroic could he be turned into a real boy that his puppet maker father wanted. It happens near the end when he has to make a daring rescue from a large whale in the ocean.The great Mel Blanc provided many of the voices but to me the main one is Cliff Edwards who voiced Jiminy Cricket and who sings the iconic ""When You Wish Upon A Star"", the whole impetus for this story."
85,Pinocchio,10,27 April 2017,Excellent Disney classic!,"Everyone knows about this one! I remember watching this classic as a child on VHS tape at my grandparents all the time. I'm surprised I didn't completely wear that tape out! It's so easy to know why this film is still beloved today by audiences. It's just so well made on every level and wildly entertaining. First of all, the animation is incredible and if you buy this on Blu Ray today then it still holds up pretty well. The characters are interesting and written with great depth. Pinocchio, Geppetto, and Jiminey Cricket are all great characters that the audience comes to care deeply about. You follow Pinnochio on his journey of becoming human and learning what it means to be honest in life. It teaches great important lessons about honesty and other good values, so that makes it extra suitable for families to view. The story is entertaining, adventurous at many times. Pinocchio getting lured and placed with a group of other boys and promised great things, which leads ultimately to very negative consequences. All the time this is going on, Geppetto never stops looking for his son Pinocchio. I 100% suggest this wonderfully made fun Disney classic. 10/10!"
86,Pinocchio,10,18 February 2017,Wishes Come True,"I've said it before and I'll say it again: I am a sucker for classic Walt Disney movies. At 59 years of age with no grandchildren I still make a point of adding the releases of classic Disney animated films to my collection. I never grow tired of watching them and they still retain the magic for me that they had when I viewed them decades ago as a child. I enjoy them with great nieces and nephews when I have the chance, exposing them to the magic that is Disney. They might find the animation lacking in a world of computer generated images but there is no mistaking that these films are works of art.So it is with the release of PINOCCHIO: THE SIGNATURE COLLECTION EDITION on blu-ray. Yes, it has been released previously but as with all Disney re-releases new features have been added and each time they attempt to offer the cleanest and brightest picture possible. They never fail.For those unaware of the story being told (where have you been to miss this?) it tells of a lonely marionette maker named Gepetto whose latest creation is a young boy he names Pinocchio. During the night a fairy arrives at his shop and brings the boy to life, placing a cricket named Jiminy in charge of watching over him, to be his conscience. Gepetto rises delighted to find him alive. But Pinocchio doesn't want to be just a marionette. He wants to be a real live boy.This goal sets Pinocchio and by association Jiminy on a set of adventures while Pinocchio tries to become that. As a young and uninformed person Pinocchio falls prey to the perils of life, kidnapped at one point and setting off to join a group of other young boys who want to grow up into a terror filled journey that finds some of them turned into burros. All the while Jiminy continues to warm Pinocchio of the dangers he is about to encounter but his warning seem to fall on deaf ears.Pinocchio's quest is a noble one. He loves his ""father"" Gepetto and wishes to become a real boy to be normal but also because he wants to please Gepetto. The bond between the two is as much parent to child as could be found. And before the story ends both will place themselves in danger because of the bond they have.Watching this movie again after all these years it continues to hold up to the test of time. That was one of the most magical things about the classic Disney movies. They were not rooted in one decade or another 60 years later. The stories were timeless and always offered a bit of common sense guidance not determined by social mores of the time but based on things everyone should know and learn. It isn't about political correctness or a cause but about life in general and that's why they remain some of the best films around. In a year where we have all been pounded with politics it is wonderful to see a movie not mired in that but that offers a compelling story that teaches as well.As I said earlier the movie itself is a masterwork of art, with images that were drawn by some of the best and brightest that Disney ever had working for him. Their ability to bring to life this story and to make it interesting is amazing. And it isn't just the characters that make it so but the backgrounds, the settings and the attention to detail that make this film one that is a visual feast for the eyes. To just imagine the work that went into a single minute of film is stunning. To realize that the movie contains 88 minutes of that is astounding.In addition to the remastered look of the film there are several new bonus items included as well. One is a reworking of the now famous tune from the film ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" as done by 3 Disney kids. Another is a behind the scenes making of on the film. A third is a behind the scenes look at items discussed for the Pleasure Island sequence that were abandoned and not used. There is a discussion with Walt Disney about the character of Pinocchio and the making of the movie. And there is a short cartoon featuring Oswald the lucky rabbit, one of the earliest creations of young animator Walt Disney. Not enough? Well there are indeed more extras to be found.In addition to that the movie is available in a packaging that includes both the blu-ray and DVD versions on disc as well as a digital download for the film making it as portable as you possibly can right now. If you aren't aware of digital downloads of films then by all means you need to begin looking into Vudu and ultra violet editions. This movie would be a great place to start.When all is said and done PINOCCHIO remains the treasure that it was the first time you saw it. If you have children then don't let this on pass you by. Normally Disney releases a film and then removes it from the market for several years. So pick this one up before that happens because by the time it comes around again your child might think themselves too ""grown up"" for a Disney flick. Have it on hand so they can enjoy it now. But don't let them know that you're enjoying it more than they are. Let it provide family memories now like it did for you when you were young. Isn't your family worth the investment?"
87,Pinocchio,7,1 February 2017,"Sweet, fun movie - an exemplary Disney film","Jiminy Cricket finds himself at the home of Geppetto, a simple carpenter and toy-maker. Geppetto is old and his only company is his cat, Figaro, and goldfish, Cleo. He has made a toy puppet, Pinocchio, and wishes that the puppet was a real boy. To his astonishment, this comes true. Pinocchio now sets about behaving like a real boy, with Jiminy as his guide and conscience, but the novelty of being a wooden boy soon attracts the attention of some unscrupulous characters.Sweet, fun movie. Iconic too - one of the first movies you associate with Disney. Gave the world ""When you wish upon a star"", pretty much the Disney anthem.Not perfect though. After a wonderful start it does degenerate into a rambling adventure from a point. Not quite as profound or emotional as some other Disney movies, eg Bambi.Still a great watch though and ideal for all ages."
88,Pinocchio,,27 January 2017,"After many years, it still SHINES !","It has been ages since I watched Pinocchio. I remember being scared of Monstro as a kid and years later having to take a little boy out to the theater lobby when ""the whale scene"" came on. That segment is still a bit unsettling.The songs are still memorable. The fuzzy villains are so well done that they are actually ""cute"" doing their evil deeds. The human ones, not so much... but I do have a problem with people of their ilk.The typical ""child in jeopardy"", ""child separated from parent"" so beloved by the Disney Studio is here in spades but it works better here than in some of the later Disney films.The animated clocks and music boxes. Great stuff. Details galore. Worth using the pause and reverse buttons to look things over.Figaro ! One of the BEST cats ever. The disgruntled way he gets up to open the window is just terrific. Again, a little detail that works.Nostalgia ? Maybe. But then maybe not. It's a really good film and well worth watching."
89,Pinocchio,7,17 September 2016,"Be brave, truthful and unselfish in life to be a good boy!","Before writing my review I'll confess that I haven't seen any Disney film before Pinocchio and The Lion King. Though Lion King was much better than this, Pinocchio wasn't that down. I liked this film, film's depiction and the aim behind it. Pinocchio is that animation film that I had to see it in order to finish my passion of watching all good rated films on IMDb. And thus seeing fairly hood reviews of this I decided to give it a chance. And I guess it wasn't a dull choice. But nor did it make my passion of entertaining me fulfill. Coming to the story, it is as fantasy as other Disney movies. Disney movies are mostly consisting of fantasy themes and with a moralistic message. And this wasn't different. I liked the theme, message behind it and how the characters played their part as well. But still, I'll not say this was the best film by Disney. There was some kind of overload. Story was dragged a bit in the second half. It became slow and felt like I should stop watching it. Although characters ain't boring either and that led me to finish movie successfully. A tale where a Cricket's life is going to be changed by a single wish - a wish granted by other, for the other and through the other medium. And what follows next is fun to watch. Again, a Disney movie which seems for the minor age group of people that was a shocker, by letting the minds of older people attract as well. Story which can be related to this day in twenty first century too, is shown so delightfully that any person can have an urge to enjoy for one and a half hours. In all this is a one time watch for a Disney lover and may not want to miss it. P.S. Please keep your subconscious minds with you while watching this flick."
90,Pinocchio,8,30 April 2016,"Not a bad movie by any means,","but incomparable to Snow White or some of the modern Disney movies. Pinocchio does have the funny 1940s slapstick, a solid story, and some good music (When You Wish Upon a Star is far from my favorite Disney song, but I can still enjoy it), though as a sucker for dark movies, I wasn't particularly thrilled by the action scenes in Pinocchio, such as Lampwick's transformation into a jackass. While the TV I saw it on did have the volume turned low, I was borderline amused by Lampwick's misfortune, and I wondered out loud if the Coachman and his goons really had an abundance of carts for what was once the Stupid Little Boys to drag. I did appreciate the voice acting (John Worthington Foulfellow's voice was my favorite), and I also appreciated the rather surreal nature of the Ligurian village the film is set in (we have a realistic cat, Figaro, and an anthropomorphic cat, Gideon, as one example), and I could see how creative the writers could get with 5 villains. Overall, Pinocchio is much too good to be called decent, but Snow White is better."
91,Pinocchio,10,26 April 2015,Give a Little Whistle,"The scene of Jiminy Cricket: He's dancing on the violin a bit, balancing a bit with umbrella opened, mimicked a trombone with umbrella, smelling a tobacco...but wait! I saw Jiminy is bouncing on the whistling saw. That's what Jiminy holding his two feet for a split legs like a baby and bouncing for a split legs for the baby diapers and other stuff. Jiminy did bouncing on the whistling saw with a split legs.He is continuing to bouncing to the cuckoo clock, tap dancing a bit before changing the clock to 11:30, knocked on the door, marching while the wooden carving of a farmer, wife, and cow began ringing bells with the cricket leading them. Then, he stopped near the door as the wooden carvings began going in while the carving of the daughter was seen.Just like the Pluto shorts, ""Lend a Paw"" for Pluto's Angel and Pluto's Devil is on it with Pluto. In fact, Pluto met Jiminy Cricket wants for a whistle song. That's my favorite scene.I have a scene of Jiminy is bouncing on the whistling saw. It was good, very good. That's what Jiminy loved to bounce on the saw."
92,Pinocchio,7,23 September 2014,Average magic,"I wasn't very big into this Disney movie even when I was little. However watching it now, I can kinda appreciate this film for what it is. I personally think the message delves into even real life issues of today. The animation is fluid and very well done for it's time. The direction when it comes to the message it utilized in a way, where kids and adults can take in and comprehend. I liked how it delves into the flaws of people and overcoming those flaws. To become a better person. The music is decent and fit in with the direction of the story. However I personally couldn't have sympathy or compassion towards Pinocchio, yeah he suppose to be a kid and all. But the build up just wasn't all that good when it came to Pinocchio's development to warrant any affection from me. Overall, this is a Disney film that deserves to stand out from the bunch, but I personally thought it was just alright. Nothing more, but nothing less.7.5/10"
93,Pinocchio,7,28 April 2008,Lucky he never met Woody Woodpecker,"The adventures of the little tree-boy, and his, at least herein, rather... fond of girls, conscience, the bug. In typical Disney style, this moralizes(and uses the ""scare 'em straight"" technique, which I'm presuming was popular at the time... maybe Walt was intending to give Santa some competition), as well as adding entries to the, even at that time, long list of ""don't really try to do this, kids... no, honestly"". The plot isn't bad, and told fine. The character gallery is reasonable. The acting is somewhat mixed in quality. The sound is decent, same goes for music. Humor could use at least a little more variation. Some jokes and gags are good, and achieved nicely. This approaches 90 minutes, feature length. The DVD holds several special features... a game(so simple and easy that it places itself dangerously close to the limit for how little it takes for something to be designated as such...though finishing it does beget a prize for fans of the Disney short cartoons), two ""I'm No Fool"" animated pieces, the original trailer and a making of. Animation is impressive for the time, and does have great details and the like. I recommend this to fans of Disney. 7/10"
94,Pinocchio,10,4 May 2007,A great Disney movie which I actually enjoyed better than Snow White!,"Pinocchio is Walt's second picture and a great movie which I found superior to Snow White! I love the songs better as well, with ""Give a little whistle"" and ""I have no strings"". This film gives the introduction to Jiminy Cricket, Disney's alternative main character to Mickey Mouse. It teaches you a lot of life lessons, too! Like, be a good friends and respect your parents and elders and not forgetting ""Let your conscience be your guide"" The animation is totally flawless and voice talents are top of the list! I just love the surroundings of the backgrounds. There so beautiful animated and it makes you want to visit the place although it's not real! This is one of favourite Disney films and you should see it or you'll miss out on something good! 10/10"
95,Pinocchio,10,20 July 2005,Great one!,"I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities. The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear. Not to mention beautiful! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious Looney Tunes characters that we all love. in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen. In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do! If you like the original Looney Tunes and animated films then I strongly recommend that you watch this movie today!"
96,Pinocchio,,9 August 2003,One Of The Best Disney Movie Ever Made.,"Pinocchio (1940)This is one of Disney's best films, and always will be. I remember watching this movie over and over as a kid, and I loved it, especially Jimeny Cricket. The movie had a wonderful end sequence full of action and fun. An awesome kid's movie. This is one of the most memorable Disney films of all time. Simply wonderful! I give it 10/10."
97,Pinocchio,10,17 June 2002,Excellent,"This is one of the most beautifully animated films ever.  The color, the use of the  camera angles, made it one of the most beautifully animated films of all time.  And the song is so beautiful, and magical.  It has become the theme song for Disney."
98,Pinocchio,6,10 October 2005,How did Jiminy breathe underwater?,"Curiosity drew me as I knew the official Disney tale only from a truncated storybook version I read as a child and the totems at Disneyland. Looking for influences, I wonder if Monstro the Whale is a distant relative of H.R. Giger's Alien? Other random thoughts? Nice deliberate disparagement of actors, consistent with then skimpy emolument of cartoon voice talent. I don't believe the 1940's saw salaries like those of Shrek stars, Myers and Murphy et al. As far as Geppetto goes, what does an old Italian coot want to be sleeping with a little (wooden) boy for anyway? Gotta love the anachronism of cigar chomping, beer swilling urchins at Pleasure Island. Not to be seen in contemporary family film under the auspices of the MPAA. I believe any explicit depiction of drug or alcohol use by minors compels a less marketable R rating. Some lovely scares, though the fright factor might have been aided by my friend, Mary Jane's visit earlier that evening, I mean why would I be watching Pinnochio otherwise? Educational value is decent: of course it taps into the usual Disney theme of childhood fear of abandonment, which is probably not too harmful in measure if you're having trouble keeping your wee ones in check. In that context, I'm thinking of poor Pinoc sobbing, caged in Stromboli's wagon-- pretty woeful stuff. Anyway, it all boils down to this, kids: be brave, truthful and unselfish and you might have a chance. Also, don't talk to strange foxes, cats and evil-looking fat men. Or just any strange fat men, for that matter."
99,Pinocchio,10,3 November 2000,the best Disney cartoon ever!,"okay, so the quality of animation has gone miles ahead since 1940. But all that doesn't matter, since this one has the best story, most charming characters, and best songs. I believe the Italian version is even better than the original one. It has a certain charm that is not there in the english version. Maybe that's because the story was written by an italian man. The voice characterizations and dialogues in this movie are superb. This movie hasn't dated a bit in 60 years, it's just as watchable and entertaining now as it was back then. There's truly never a dull moment in this film. If you still haven't seen it, you have never really lived.

100,Pinocchio,8,20 August 2015,One of the Disney Greats,"A living puppet (Dickie), with the help of a cricket (Cliff Edwards) as his conscience, must prove himself worthy to become a real boy.This film came out in 1940, which makes it 75 years old as I write this review in 2015. It could just as easily be five or ten years old, because the film has not aged a day. In fact, if anything, it has only grown in stature. The character of Pinocchio is legendary, and today that is almost universally because of the cartoon and not the original story.Some of the songs are timeless, most notably ""When You Wish Upon a Star"". To a lesser agree, ""Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide"". These are just great tunes that are rarely found in films anymore, certainly not songs that become part of the popular culture and consciousness."
101,Pinocchio,8,28 March 2015,Disney's best?,"Disney have had a huge influence on culture, but to judge their films as films alone, and without those red-tinted baby-goggles, usually means to wonder what all the fuss is about.Sure, Dumbo has that amazing drunk scene, Jungle Book those catchy songs and Alice with its lush moments of surrealism, but as films go the adult you (or me, in this case) is not really that into them anymore....because...you know...for kids!And yet somehow I ended up watching Pinocchio for the first time in donkey yonks...and lo...it's objectively and subjectively brilliant! It offers pretty much everything: warm vibes, comedy, sadness, silliness, darkness, terror, the strange, the ridiculous...and Moby Dick.It also serves up only partly a happy end...(those poor kids).Not a 9 or a 10 as those odd jumps in narrative can be a bit furrowed brow, but from all the animated films I've seen & rated only Akira, Transformers (1986) and Watership Down outrank this epic Pinocchio.Recommended for everyone."
102,Pinocchio,10,28 February 2012,Jaw dropping animation and a great story!,"This is Disney's crowning achievement! Snow White was absolutely fabulous and deserves its place in history as the first feature length cartoon. But one sees after a couple of minutes into Pinocchio that the Disney animators were hungry for more. This is a movie that tries to reach for something more and greater. It succeeds. The opening scene contains some of the most heart warming and magical moments ever animated. And then the glorious scene as the camera pans through town and children head off to school (it must have taken them months to do those 2 minutes!). And then the movie gets dark real fast as Pinocchio gets conned and manipulated by frankly evil characters. But the story is so simple and so easy for us as an audience to relate to (what child has never wanted to be a ""good"" one and somehow wandered off and gotten into real trouble) that we take it in. This movie makes you FEEL. The sweet scenes make you giddy with joy and the creepy scenes are truly frightening. Parents, this is a good kids movie, but you simply MUST watch it with them to ask them how they are doing or hold them through the scarier scenes. Well worth it to share the moment with them. And the animation is second to none. In this age of computer animation, I was astounded at how much detail and movement was packed into these old oil based paintings, how smooth they were animated, and how fluid they were. No detail is missed. No cost is spared to bring this story to life. ""Thank you once again, Mr. Disney!"""
103,Pinocchio,10,11 October 2011,"Quality song, quality synopsis, simply the best Disney movie (and of course version) ever!","The 2nd animated feature to have been made by Walt Disney, Pinocchio is based on the novel of the same name by Carlo Collodi. Set in Italy, the Pinocchio in question is a marionette created by Gepetto and metamorphosed by the Blue Fairy after Gepetto's wish. Guided by a talking cricket, Jiminy Cricket', the puppet must learn the rights and wrongs and prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish in order for Gepetto's wish to become entirely true. Although Snow White & The 7 Dwarfs marked Disney's introduction to feature movies, Pinocchio, it's follower, is arguably the best film Disney has ever produced! The film is darker than most cartoons and will freak out every child who watches it. The scene where Strombolli, the greedy puppet expert, kidnaps Pinocchio is bad-ass and the magical Pleasure Island will touch more nerves, because it demonstrates that making a jackass out of yourself will make you feel worse. The whole work of art warns children, well any viewer, never to accept advice from strangers. Examples are shown by the foxy Honest John and his feline sidekick Gideon. Another enchanting element about Pinocchio are the representations. Being a fox, Honest John is a symbol to slyness (eat ya heart out Kubes!); Pinocchio is convinced that John is telling the truths, but is he? The location; Pleasure Island is a murkier version of Neverland. It's holiday reps allow the boys to behave badly, but the boys somehow make jackasses of themselves. Monstro, a monstrous sperm whale, could easily be compared with monster movie characters i.e. Godzilla, the Incredible Hulk and Bruce the shark. Pinocchio uses a superb voice cast; one of the actors being the famous ukulele player Cliff Edwards, who voices Jiminy Cricket and deservedly won an Oscar for the best original song 'When You Wish Upon A Star', simply the best song in the world! It apparently was an anthem for World War 2 and the lyrics depict a dream coming true, part of the subject matter. The film also had an Oscar for the best original score, and an excellently written one too, because the music creates the atmosphere, in particular, during the haunting Pleasure Island scene. Pinocchio is a very much recommended film if no viewer has viewed it yet. Attracting generations of children and loved by grandparents, this film remains a classic and is so much better than Bambi."
104,Pinocchio,7,16 May 2011,"The magic is all-encompassing, surpassing every cynic's reservations...","Carlo Collodi's moral fantasy tale from 1883, ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"", gently comes to animated life in this classic Walt Disney feature. In a small Italian village, a lonely woodcarver's puppet is brought to life by the Blue Fairy, who is then aided by his persnickety cricket conscience in matters of right and wrong. ""Music, professor!"" could be the cue for any Disney production from this era, and here the Oscar-winning score is imperative--it shapes and molds the characters and the story (which is creaky at times, but let it pass). Jiminy Cricket quickly became one of Disney's most beloved cartoon creations, and his voice (provided by the inimitable Cliff Edwards) masterfully evokes the heart and carefree humor had from childhood. The detail in ""Pinocchio"" is amazing, wondrously warm instead of fussy, while the humor saves it from lapsing into treacle (and this is something Disney was extremely accomplished at). The rich color and tone of the movie sweeps the viewer up in a feeling of good will, yet you don't feel guilty for welling up afterward. This isn't a corny audience-pleaser, it is a major accomplishment which has stood the test of the time. *** from ****"
105,Pinocchio,9,8 April 2011,Adaptation - a major Disney strength,"There have been thousands of words written about the quality of Disney's animation, the draughtsmanship and artistry of the animators, the music, the backgrounds, the technical innovation and so on, but relatively little about the studio's ability to adapt works which might not, at first glance, be the ideal subjects for animated features, into the classic they turned out to be.Carlo Collodi's original is a good yarn, if a little loaded down with moralising. Disney's adaptation kept the essential nature of the story, the moral heart, the main characters and, while staying true to them, stripped out extraneous detail, beefed up the set pieces, and turned a literary work of art into an animated triumph.Collodi's story didn't have songs - but Disney Studios still use the refrain of When You Wish Upon A Star in its opening logo sequence."
106,Pinocchio,10,26 December 2010,The Well-loved  Tale About A Wooden Puppet That Wants To Be A Real Boy.,"Facts About Pinocchio: Pinocchio (pronounced piˈnɔkːjo in Italian) is a fictional character that first appeared in 1881, in The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi, and has since appeared in many adaptations of that story and others. Carved from a piece of pine by a woodcarver named Geppetto in a small Italian village, he was created as a wooden puppet, but dreamt of becoming a real boy. The name Pinocchio is Italian for ""Pine eyes"".Pinocchio is known for having a long nose that becomes longer when he is under stress (chapter 3), especially while telling a lie. His clothes are made of flowered paper, his shoes are made of wood and his hat is made of bread (page 16 of Collodi's Le Avventure di Pinocchio). Geppetto gave him the name Pinocchio because it is an Italian Name of good fortune.Pinocchio made into a cartoon film: In 1940, the story of Pinocchio was made into a full length animated film by Walt Disney. The second film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics, it was made after the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and was released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 7, 1940.The plot of the film involves a wooden puppet named Pinocchio (voice of Dickie Jones) being brought to life by a blue fairy (Evelyn Venable), who tells him he can become a real boy if he proves himself ""brave, truthful, and unselfish"". Thus begin the puppet's adventures to become a real boy, which involve many encounters with a host of unsavory characters.The film was adapted by Aurelius Battaglia, William Cottrell, Otto Englander, Erdman Penner, Joseph Sabo, Ted Sears, and Webb Smith from Collodi's book. The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske, and the film's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, and Bill Roberts.Pinocchio won two Academy Awards, one for Best Original Score and one for Best Original Song for the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star"".Plot: Jiminy Cricket walked into the workshop of the woodworker Mister Geppetto to warm himself from the cold, and watches as Geppetto finishes work on a puppet he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a falling star that Pinocchio could be a real boy. During the night, the Blue Fairy visits the workshop to grant Geppetto's wish and brings Pinocchio to life, though he is still a puppet. The fairy tells Pinocchio that if he wants to become a real boy of flesh and blood he must prove himself to be brave, truthful and unselfish and able to tell right from wrong by listening to his conscience. Pinocchio doesn't understand what a conscience is, and Jiminy appears to explain it to him. The Blue Fairy asks if Jiminy would serve as Pinocchio's conscience, a task he accepts.Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. The next day, he sends Pinocchio on his first day of school. However, Pinocchio is led astray by the conniving Honest John and Gideon, who convince him to join Stromboli's puppet show instead. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction, but when Pinocchio offers to come back in the morning, Stromboli locks Pinocchio in a birdcage to stop him leaving. With the help of the Blue Fairy and Jiminy, Pinocchio escapes.Unfortunately, on his way back to Geppetto's house, Pinocchio is once again led astray by Honest John and Gideon, who convince him to go to Pleasure Island. On his way he befriends Lampwick, a misbehaved and destructive boy. Soon Pinocchio and the other boys begin to enjoy gambling, smoking, getting drunk and destroying Pleasure Island, much to Jiminy's dismay. Then Jiminy discovers the island has a curse that transforms boys who ""make jackasses of themselves"" into real donkeys, who are then sold to work in the salt mines and circuses as part of an evil racket run by The Coachman. Lampwick is soon transformed into a donkey, but Pinocchio manages to escape with a donkey's ears and tail.Upon returning home, they find the workshop empty and soon learn from a letter by the Blue Fairy that Geppetto, while venturing out to sea to rescue Pinocchio from Pleasure Island, had been swallowed by a giant whale named Monstro. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the bottom of the ocean, with Jiminy accompanying him. However, Pinocchio is soon found and eaten by Monstro, where he is reunited with Geppetto and his pets inside the whale. Pinocchio devises an escape plan by burning wood in order to make Monstro sneeze. The plan works, but the enraged whale gives chase. Eventually, Pinocchio succeeds in getting Geppetto to safety in a cave under a cliff before Monstro rams into it, but Pinocchio dies in the process. As Geppetto, Jiminy and the pets mourn the loss, the Blue Fairy decides that Pinocchio has proved himself unselfish and thus fulfills her promise to turn him into a real boy, bringing him back to life, much to the delight of Geppetto and Jiminy.In conclusion 10/10 points: a masterpiece of animation and to be enjoyed any time of the day and in all seasons.

107,Pinocchio,9,10 November 2009,Charming musical animation that shows kids in the right light,"When Geppetto wishes upon a star his wooden puppet Pinocchio comes to life and he must prove himself worthy to become a real boy.Walt Disney's second major outing as film presenter went rewarded with a splendid tale of obeying rules and good things come to those who live without breaking the order and this is one of those films that will have you laughing and crying.This picture released almost 70 years ago now has just celebrated a rerelease DVD packed with numerous bonus features but ultimately this is all about the main article, the arguably most controversial Disney picture ever created.Whilst spurring ideologies of youthful exuberance and a charming array of musical numbers this picture has been lively debated to contain concepts of underage drinking and smoking, childhood cruelty and the superficial concept of wishful thinking.Given the board of classification rated this as a family viewing U given today's modern trend of exclusion of truth in animation it is quite shocking. Recently the much loved Dennis the Menace has abolished Walter the softy because it represents ""gay bashing"" somehow and given the contrast this will be quite something in today's modern era.Significantly this underage usage of alcohol and cigarettes is a point to be addressed in today's environment in any country and quite frankly we need to reflect these modern rules of neglectful safety and show what life is really like because there are kids who drink and smoke and obviously it is wrong, and blissfully this animation reflects a motive of karma and the after effects are exceptionally dramatic. The use of Jackasses is heavily critical to demonstrate the foul use of the substance on children.The use of the evil characters makes them all financially greedy and self involved which is fine to convey the evilness against the goodness but the fact that Pinocchio follows in their footsteps initially adds extra dreaming and controversy to the young wooden boy's persona and this character development is extraordinarily dependent on the wishes of a fairy, with the timing a tend to convenient.Pinocchio, a boy made from wood, is ultimately destined to be a real boy if he obeys the rules and his acts of selfishness and inappropriate desires end up giving Jiminy Cricket a case of the blues as he ponders his usefulness. Pinocchio is a selfish character undeniably wound up in his new existence that spells disaster for those around him.And this is fantastic. Nothing represents our modern youthful stereotypes more than self involvement and given the eventual conclusion in the whale and the unforgettable nose growing sequence this demonstrates a time when animation pushed the rules right to the edge and with a carefully woven music score this is what animation should be. This is still great to watch for the family, and with an underlining sense of right and wrong, is an exceptional reflection of the right and wrong."
108,Pinocchio,,10 September 2003,my childhood favorite,"This was my favorite movie when it was rerelesed in theaters 11-years-ago. It was my favorite throughout most of my 1st grade year, later it became Aladdin. The movie has warmhearted, funny, and even some of the darkest scariest things in animation history. I wonder why they didn't rate this PG when it was rereleased, I mean today ""jackass"" would without doubt be considered a cuss word, and it was said numerous times at pleasure Island, I'd think it would be PG, no doubt. Pleasure island is a very dark place which makes the movie good in a way, seems like the darkest place in Disney animation history. The bad-boys turn into donkeys and become slaves, and never come back as boys which is very unpleasant and depressing..In a Disney movie, characters always end up happy ever after. I hope to god they got turned back to boys, but again the darkness was great. The language and smoking and drinking make this a more mature cartoon. It has a profound message that ""We've got no strings"" and we have to listen to our conscience, the scenes with Monstro the Sperm whale were also great and far-fetched, and shows us again the deep, blue scary ocean to show us how scary this movie can be. Not to mention there's Stromboli, after a beautiful play, he throws Pinocchio in a cage and says he'll burn him like firewood! There's suspense to spare, and magic and charm."
109,Pinocchio,,27 October 1999,The most brilliant animated film ever to light the screen.,"A beautiful allegory about what it means to be a part of the human family -- in order to become a ""real"" person, a wooden puppet must prove that he can stand up for what is right, be truthful to himself and others, and be giving and protective. Its a tall order.Disney's true animated masterpiece is often cited as the most technically astounding animated film ever made, but look past the eye-candy and you'll find the richest narrative of any of Disney's endeavors. PINOCCHIO is a complex fantasy that works as straight-ahead adventure and also as a commentary on human morality - with some satire and whimsy to boot. Take the richest story Disney ever explored and group it with the greatest team of animators ever assembled, and you have what has become - rightly - a certified National Treasure."
110,Pinocchio,,7 May 1999,perfection,"disney's greatest, beyond any doubt.  the best music, the best animation the best characters, the best script, the best song, the most beautiful artwork, and the most emotionally rich film they ever did, and one of my two favorite films of all time  (the other being chaplin's city lights).  this film is so touching-- can you not be moved by gepetto's search, when the lightning drowns out his voice? or not be awed by the whale chase?  one of the ten greatest films of all time."

Pinocchio is all about childhood fears, fear of being abandoned by you're parents, not fitting in, deciding between right and wrong. There is so much in Pinocchio for every generation to admire and think about, which makes me sad when I look at how many people have taken the time to comment about it. When a film is as timeless as this, so timeless that it can be practically re-made (A.I. Artificial Intelligence) more people should be watching it, It's one of the finest animated films ever made and a true Disney Classic, much darker than some of Walt's other productions, which might be off putting to young children, but for me Pinocchio is essential viewing."
112,Pinocchio,9,9 June 2000,Wonderful film,"Once upon a time =),Walt Disney´s films had the distinction of being the first films to be shown to us, children. Those were the days when re-runs were perfectly acceptable, and instead of huge cinema multiplexes, there was a single, gigantic movie screen. And life was good.I must have seen Pinocchio there. Somehow I forgot about it for a long time.That is, until my mother gave it to me 2 or 3 Christmas ago. I wondered why... after all, I was 23 at the time.Well, this movie is definitely best enjoyed when you grow up. Not because of the storyline (which is wonderful), or because of the characters (which are excruciatingly detailed), but because of the message. People can get pretty cynical after 20-something years in this world, and I haven't found a better cure than listening to the beautiful lyrics of ""When you wish upon a star"".
1 year ago I visited Disneyland. Funny thing was, I hadn't been there for a long time (I visited the place when I was a teenager). I stood in the center of the park, watching the Disney statue, and I was standing on top of a plaque, which read ""When you wish upon a star, all your dreams come true"".I bet if Disney's dreams did come true, mine will too. Inspirational, to say the least."
113,Pinocchio,5,10 October 2008,One of the most scary movies to watch as a 6 year old !!!,"I will never EVER forget the day that my dad took me to see this movie. All went well until the ""ocean scene"" was due. The animation was so lifelike that (as a 6 year old) you actually believed that the character was real and alive. A movie which can achieve that deserves the biggest compliment. BUT...The moment Pinocchio goes into the ocean my 6-year old brain said: ""Now wait a minute... how can he breath under water?!"" I literally held my breath and was glued to the screen. And then all of a sudden one of the most shocking experiences of my life appeared ! Indeed, Monstro the whale. I read people talking about the transformation as being one of the most scary scenes, well I watched that without any problem as I recall, but the sudden appearance of the whale has shocked me tremendously. It was so bad that my dad had to carry me out of the movie theater. I am not kidding whatsoever when I say that this scene has been haunting me for several years. Whenever a room was dark I saw that whale again ! Man oh man ! No wonder this movie got a PG rating ! I totally agree that in all Disney movies there's good and evil but this one was a bit over the top ! My dad never took me to see another movie that year. Yet, the following year he tried it again and took me to see ""Sword in the stone"". All went well until (can't you guess ?)... the boy falls into the water and is suddenly confronted with this big fish. I immediately saw the whale in my mind and once again I went hysterical and had to be removed from the theater. These are true events. Mind you, I have watched The Exorcist and other shockers without blinking an eye, but even now... at 48, I will still be on my uard when a commercial for a Pinocchio DVD is on TV. I kid you not. This was the most horrifying experience of my childhood. Maybe even traumatic. Even Leonard Maltin wrote is his ""Movie Guide"" that the whale chase was one of the most scary scenes ever put on film. He was totally right."
114,Pinocchio,6,22 March 2006,Pretty good.,"I do not hate this film, though I have to give it a six, and no higher than that.The main reason this is a ""pretty good"" film is that the main point, or one of the main points is the star thing. ""Ehen you wish upon a star, then all your dreams will come true."" This is a vital reference in several other Disney films. At Disneeyland, the 50th Anniversary is being celebrated, and this is part of the fireworks display that they have there nightly.The story is so-so. like the fact that Pinocchio is turned permanently into a real boy, and he lives with Gepetto from then on.I'm not familiar with the voice cast, but it's done really well.My Score: 6/10."
115,Pinocchio,4,27 August 2011,...did I see the same movie?,"Pinocchio is hailed as one of the greatest animated movies of all time. Everyone rants and raves about how amazing it is. But I sat down to watch it again and liked it even less than when I was a kid (this is coming from someone who likes other Disney films more now, at age 20, than as a kid). Why? I honestly don't understand why everyone says this is Disney's best work.I admit, for its day and even for now, the animation is superb. I only saw one or two flaws in the whole movie and they were pretty easy to miss. But as nice as it all looks, the continuity was pretty bad. There's a scene in which Jiminy Cricket hangs his coat and hat on a peg. Next shot, it's gone. We see Pinocchio with the hat and coat a few seconds later but they literally disappear off the peg. There's also a scene in which one of the characters is singing and his mouth literally doesn't move at all. And it's pretty dang obvious.The music is good too. I don't have any complaints about it. It has solid music that's cute and charming and it's all good. So that's one thing the movie did well.But the story... Hoo boy. First off, the story is a confusing mess. There's no real storyline weaving throughout unless you count Pinocchio's attempts to be a real boy. How does this lead him all over the place? It doesn't. The story of his attempts to be a real boy are scrapped during scenes that don't make a whole lot of sense to begin with. It is never explained how and why bad boys become donkeys (unless you count Jiminy Cricket's line about how they're acting like jackasses). It is also never explained what happens to them when they become donkeys. Are they sold somewhere? Who's the guy rounding them up? And wouldn't parents get worried if a huge crowd of little boys randomly disappear periodically? Why are the talking ones discarded? They're still donkeys. They can still be sold. I have so many questions about that scene. It just doesn't make ANY sense.And then they return to the house to find that Pinocchio's father has been swallowed by a whale while he was looking for Pinocchio. Okay so the father was so stupid he actually went into the water looking for his wooden son or the whale jumped out of the water and swallowed him. Also, who left the note for them? Someone who saw it? How did they get the birds to deliver it? Was it Giselle from Enchanted sending her doves with a message again? And then there's the whale. So whales are vicious carnivores now? I admit I could be wrong but that whale looked like one of the ones known for only eating krill. And then there was the fire. So they make the whale sneeze by burning it from the inside? How does that make sense?? Smoke doesn't make you sneeze.And those are just a few of my examples of why this movie is far from the best Disney movie ever made. It's not bad but it's certainly not good. It's adequate. Entertaining but nothing special. It looks nice but there really isn't anything beneath the surface. So yeah I'd recommend it to Disney fans. But I think I'll leave the title of ""best animated movie"" to The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (if only because it features the introduction of characters that are now more popular than Mickey Mouse and friends... and it's my favorite too). Pinocchio is just another movie on the list of Disney animated features. Nothing more, nothing less."
116,Pinocchio,10,21 June 2011,Enjoyed watching it,"This film is about a man called Gepetto who wishes that his puppet he made was a real boy, one night the blue fairy comes and brings the puppet Pinocchio to life. Jiminy Cricket who appears at the start and goes into Gepetto's house is made to be Pinocchio's conscience. Throughout the film Pinocchio gets into loads of adventures including getting his father out of Monstro the whale.I first saw this in the early 90's but didn't watch this properly until about 10 years ago. My favourite scene is the beginning when Jiminy Cricket sings 'When You Wish Upon A Star'. My favourite character in the film was Gepetto's kitten Figaro."
117,Pinocchio,8,5 April 2011,Dinsey classics are always great!,"This is probably one of the most ""inappropriate"" Disney classics I've seen. I'm not hating it, in fact I love the movie! However, there were a few things that did prove the filmmaker's (story tellers rather) human.First, smoking. Scientifically it is proved to cause harm. Maybe not back then, but now it is. Also, I don't like smoking anyway. The first time I've heard a swear word in a Disney filmed! I know it's a pun to the term ""donkey"" but still, I'm surprised to hear it so bluntly! And what about the ending? Why didn't anyone save the poor kids? They are all turning into Donkeys and you end the movie right there and then? :("
118,Pinocchio,7,13 February 2009,A Worthy Follow-Up,"Well right off the bat, Pinocchio was never near the top of the list of my favorite animated films. And now that I am sitting down really thinking about it, I can't figure out why. The songs are good enough, the animation is really great, and it's overall a very intriguing story. Still, something is missing, and now that I am going into my second childhood and reliving the princess years, maybe that was it: no princess. No girl at all, really, except for the elusive Blue Fairy. But since it's not really relevant, I guess I'll just have to leave that oversight out of the critique.So first off: the music. Really, the only songs worth listening to are the ones Jiminy Cricket sings, but man are they whammers! The Disney banner song When You Wish Upon a Star makes its debut here and is very lovely indeed when sung by Cliff Edwards.It's really impressive how much the animation improved since Snow White in only 3 years. Visually, Pinocchio is a lot of fun and quite beautiful, even when pushing 70 (whaaat!?).And yeah, the story is pretty good too. The whole Pinocchio being a complete idiot thing can be kind of grating, but I am grateful it's been massively toned down from the original where he was just plain spiteful and you wanted to beat the sucker. And Pleasure Island... can you say terrifying? I mean, that scene still scares the ever-loving mess out of me. I give complete credit to Pinocchio for the most night-mare inducing film in animated cinema.So all in all, yeah Pinocchio has all the elements of a good film. But this one in particular seems so geared towards children, little boys in particular, that there is not as much for adults to appreciate, unless they are into getting completely creeped out by evil donkey-magic. I'll bring it out when kids come around without protest, but as for myself: I'll stick with the princesses!Quote of the film: They never come back as BOYS!"
119,Pinocchio,8,7 July 2007,Many thank you's Walt! :),"Genre: Disney cartoon film with an alive wooden puppet and a talking cricket wearing clothes. Also has a bit of cruelty in it.My thoughts: I have an affinity with this film. I feel I am a lot like Jiminy Cricket. I am clumsy and talk to myself, for example. If I were bad, I think I would be like Honest John, sly but not quite as sly as I could be and also a bit of a liar. I think I would have a tiny bit of the same jealousy as Figaro shows towards Pinocchio. Someday I may have the same talent as Geppetto. If I had smoke in my mouth I would feel the same anger as Monstro (in a way).I love this beautiful film. There are still others I prefer and the cruelty bothers me a bit, but I still love it!Recommended to: People who like Disneys, people who like the song ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" and people who like simple, yet lovely animation. Enjoy! :)What happens: A little cricket named Jiminy, stays the night in a woodcutter's cottage, in a quiet, peaceful town in Italy. In the cottage, the woodcutter, Geopetto, makes a beautiful wooden puppet named Pinocchio. He wishes it could come to life"
120,Pinocchio,9,27 July 2006,Very touching and funny Disney classic about special friendships for all ages!,"PINOCCHIO, in my opinion, is a very touching and funny Disney classic about special friendships for all ages that will warm your heart. I really loved the things that Pinocchio (voice of Dickie Jones) and Geppetto (voice of Christian Rub) did together. The music was good, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. Except for the scenes with Stromboli (voice of Charles Judels) and two other scenes, this was a good movie. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching and funny Disney classic about special friendships for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it."
121,Pinocchio,7,14 February 2006,Animation as an Art Form,"Only the second feature length animated film to be released by Disney, ""Pinocchio"" is not as accomplished as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" but it still exists as a high-water mark of screen animation.The story and songs will probably be very familiar to you, but what this movie, and really all early Disney movies, is good for is a document of traditional hand-drawn animation when it was at its most artistic. There are moments in this film that are nearly breathtaking in their visual beauty, the most memorable of all the one when Gepetto is lovingly crafting his wooden puppet and making him dance to a wonderful film score.These early animated films seem surprisingly dark and trippy now, much more so now that Disney movies exist primarily to drive money-spinning product franchises. I have to believe that Steven Spielberg's ""A.I. Articifial Intelligence"" owes much to this film.Grade: A-"
122,Pinocchio,,20 May 2002,"They couldn't have done a better job now, or then..","Such a great movie, no Pinocchio movie ever made will ever come close to being as good as this one.. To me it is one of those movies that was made generations ago, and has wondered every generation since, with the old school animation un like much done today at all.. Not even Disney themselves seem to be able to copy such great animation.. True the story has been done many times before, and after, but never captured quite like or as good as this movie has.. A great film for the whole family.. If you liked this film, I would recommend Pornocchio, another film which tried to capture such imagination, but with a different look on things.. Probably the second best to Disney's Pinocchio.. 10 out of 10 stars, because when you do wish upon a star, dreams do come true!!"
123,Pinocchio,,13 August 1999,Great film from a great book,"No animated film I've ever seen surpasses or even comes close to ""Pinocchio"" and ""Snow White.""  It's true that Disney's ""Pinocchio"" leaves out some of the most dramatic (and terrifying) moments in the original story, but it adds some good things, too, like giving the Talking Cricket a name (Jiminy). And of course the songs.  This film has great songs that carry the story along.  ""An Actor's Life for Me"" is my favorite.One might wish the monstrous Dogfish that swallows Pinocchio in the book had not been changed to a whale in the movie, but (unlike the major changes the Disney people made in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"") this change is not great enough to quibble about.Over all, Disney's ""Pinocchio"" is Carlo Collodi's ""Pinocchio.""  I loved both the movie and the book when I was a child, and I still do."
124,Pinocchio,10,22 March 1999,Pinocchio: A Moral Tale We Can Live With,"""Pinocchio,"" to me, is quintessential Disney.  I have seen it in every one of its big screen incarnations since 1955 and have watched it alone or with my kids numerous times on the small screen.  Collodi's moral tale is the stuff that children were routinely fed in a simpler time.  If you are a ""bad boy"" and break the rules, bad things will happen to you. As a small child, the capture by Stromboli and the metamorphosis into a donkey is very frightening.  Paradise is lost because our lust for paradise steals it from us.  Then there is Monstro, the whale.  He is the black symbol of satanic retribution.  Pinocchio has not only betrayed those he loves--he has brought them to danger.  He must now grow up and stop being a ""wooden head.""  When he does, his sacrifice will make him human.  We recite the moral with our tears.  See this if you never have.  It is like no other story ever written."
125,Pinocchio,,16 April 2002,Walt Disney's Masterpiece as told by this Great critic,"""When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who youare, anything you heart desires will come to you.""You've heard this song on the Disneyland and Superbowl commercials, but do you remember where it came from?It came from this cartoon, Pinocchio, Walt Disney's second feature to ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" in 1940.I repeat 1940!! Wow and to this day ,Pinocchio still stands out as one of the greatest movies of all time.
This opinion is about the 60th anniversay VHS of Pinocchio with THX sound and Remastered visual footage. It even has a bonus at the end about the making of Pinocchio!!! Wow.This was a Christmas gift for my best friend and she loved it, and I can see why.Pinocchio is filled with dazzling animation,music and filled with so much fun and happyness that at the end of the movie , you will feel like wishing upon a star youreself.Pinocchio is about a wooden puppet made by toymaker Geppeto (Christian Rub) who wants his own son.Geppeto makes one wish, to have his own son. Geppeto gets his wish when the Blue Fairy brings Pinocchio to life!!!It took nearly 700 animators and technicians to bring Pinocchio to life and the hard work definitely shows!!!People can say whatever they want about Disney current movies, true they lack a certain magic unlike their cherish cartoon like Pinocchio, but Disney is one of a few companies that has a SOLID record of making Cartoon Classics that are loved by everyone.The fairy brings Pinocchio to life and promises to Pinoccho (voice of Dickie Jones) that he will remain a real boy if he follows the basic principles that every boy should have.He has to be loyal, truthful and above fair. She assigns Jiminy Cricket (Cliff Edwards) to be Pinocchio's conscience.Well it sounds easy at first, but living up to these values is the real challenge here and Pinocchio tries his best to follow them,but since he has just being turned into a boy he doesnt yet know right from wrong.This is where we meet characters like ,J. Worthington Foulfellow, Stromboli and Barker who take advantage of the young boy.Jiminy Cricket and the fairy save Pinocchio from his judgement calls ,but yet Pinocchio doesnt learn to tell the truth and when he lies his nose starts to grow like a Christmas tree. :-)Meanwhile Geppeto is looking for Pinocchio and ends up being captured by a giant whale Monstro!!!Pinocchio saves Geppeto in a brillian animation sequence and Pinocchio by displaying bravery ends up being a real boy permanently.It's a classic, I can say more but I dont want to spoil it for anyoneIn an age, where moral, brilliant, wholesome cartoons are scarce you look back to the classics and Pinocchio will forever stand out as one of the greatest classics ever made by Walt Disney who has left his print in the world and in children's hearts.Go out and buy this for youre children"
126,Pinocchio,10,5 July 2001,Modern mythology long overdue for Sci-fi updating,"This Disney feature follow-up to the highly successful SNOW WHITE & THE SEVEN DWARFS (1937) is a visual treat and holds up well in contrast to many other Disney Studio productions.  It was already moving away from its Italian roots when the Disney treatment (1940) put the original story into a generic setting.  Gepetto has an Italian-sounding accent but I don't remember any typical expressions that are especially European, really. Some of the cuckoo-clock / glockenspiel-type musical ""robot"" figures are more Swiss-Germanic instead.  The film is a fantasy with a moralistic message that still needs to be heard -- hold onto bravery, truthfulness, and unselfishness and even death will be conquerable!  My point in this review, however, is that as modern mythology, PINOCCHIO is long overdue for a science fiction updating.  This summer (July 2001) the motion picture industry ""buzz"" is over how effective a Spielberg blockbuster can be that amalgamizes Stanley Kubrick vision and his own sensibilities.  I haven't yet seen A.I. but from my reading of the original story it utilizes, I'd say that ""being a real boy"" is still the character motivation that animates the live-action feature in its ""heart."" PINOCCHIO is well worth seeing before you visit the Multiplex for the new film, AI: Artificial Intelligence; the Brian Aldiss short story, I predict, will also provoke worthwhile musings at a level quite distinct from special effect ""fireworks."""
127,Pinocchio,10,28 December 1999,An enchanting early Disney classic which appeals to everyone.,"Pinocchio is a puppet in a delightful children's story written by ""Carlo Collodi"". (Collodi's real name was Carlo Lorenzini, and he was born in Florence, Italy, in 1826. He used the pen-name ""Collodi"" as that is the name of the little village in Tuscany where his mother was born.)In 1881, Collodi sent to a friend, who edited the ""Giornale per i Bambini"" in Rome, (""Children's Journal""), a short episode in the life of a wooden puppet, wondering whether the editor would be interested in publishing this ""bit of foolishness"". The editor did, and the children loved it.In Collodi's original story, Pinocchio gets himself into all sorts of trouble through his spiritual immaturity, but he gradually learns from each lesson, and eventually, after showing noble human traits, is granted the special privilege of being a human.Collodi wanted youngsters to learn that when we are spiritually immature, we are like a puppet, controlled by the immature needs of our ego, which make us do thoughtless, selfish and irresponsible things. But if we keep listening to our conscience, our inner awareness of right and wrong, and keep being guided by that, one day we will become ""a real live boy"", a self-reliant, mature, responsible citizen, no longer controlled by immature needs.Walt Disney, inspired by this wonderful story, and motivated by the same desire as Collodi to teach moral lessons to children through entertaining stories, smoothed the rough edges of several chapters to make a severely abridged version, and turned Pinocchio into one of his legendary cartoons, or as he preferred to call them, ""full-length animated features"".Disney, like Frank Baum and Lewis Carroll before him, had an unusually gifted understanding of the mind of children, knowing exactly what appealed to them, and Pinocchio is a classic example of his powerful insight.In this ""animated feature"" Pinocchio is given the gift of life, but must prove that he is ""brave, truthful, and unselfish"" in order to become a real boy. He is told by his ""father"", the man who carved him out of wood, to go to school and learn to read and write, but instead is tempted by a couple of rogues to join a puppet show. Later when he realises the puppets are slaves to the puppet-master, he manages to escape, only to be tempted once again, to go to ""Pleasure Island"", where everybody makes jackasses of themselves.Narrowly escaping this fate by jumping into the sea, he eventually manages to return home, only to find that his father, on hearing that Pinocchio jumped into the sea, went to sea in a boat to look for him, and was swallowed by the most feared killer whale in the sea, ""Monstro"". Can our well-meaning but wooden-headed hero rescue his father from the belly of the worst monster in existence? Will he ever be able to prove himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, and become a real live boy?Although the film was released in 1940, its appeal is timeless. It is an uplifting, inspiring story for children of all ages from four to one hundred and four. Its magic and enchantment have the power to soften even the most wooden hearts."
128,Pinocchio,4,1 October 2007,"The Crown Jewel next  to ""The Little Mermaid""? I don't think so.","Frankly, this isn't my most favourite Disney movie. I never thought it was just brilliant as a kid and I still don't think it is today. I also don't get why it's ""one of the most celebrated animated movies of all time"", I mean the film was a flop when it was initially released, very much unlike ""The Little Mermaid"". People complain that Disney always sugar coats their movies taken from stories but no one complains about this one. In the book, Pinnochio gets fed up with the cricket (I don't think he was called ""Jimony Cricket"") in the story that he smashes the cricket up against the wall with a mallet and at one point, Pinnochio falls asleep on top of a stove and burns both his feet off. Also that coach man scared me out of my wits when it did that huge close up of his face and it's all red and satanic. Just was was Disney thinking??? I do kinda like the movie, but ,like others, it ain't the first thing I'd take off the shelf and watch."
129,Pinocchio,5,26 May 2004,One of the very rare Disney movies I don't like,"I love a lot of Disney films. There are a lot of great one's and there are a lot of bad one's as well. This is an in between. It's not too bad, but it's not too good. To tell the truth, I got pretty bored. The story is very charming. And the songs are fun too, it's just not my type of Disney film. I would skip ""Pinochio"" when it comes to watching a good animation film. Otherwise, I'm going to be bored to death. I'm sorry, I could not have any sympathy for Pinocchio. It just felt silly to me. I would recommend ""Sleeping Beauty"" or ""Lion King"" over this. Those were the best Disney films. 4/10"
130,Pinocchio,5,8 October 2012,Great classic!,"Of course no matter what your age, I'm sure you've at least heard of Disney's classic movie. It was the second in a long string of excellent classics created by Walt Disney and his wonderful team.In this movie, a toy and clock maker name Geppetto, along with his two pets, a cat named Pedro and a fish named Cleo, brings this classic to life! Pedro and Cleo both have personalities without even saying a word. Then after Geppetto creates a puppet, he wishes for the puppet to become real.Our story teller is a cricket named Jimminy. He becomes a classic part of Walt Disney and will appear in other Disney movies throughout the years. We also meet a boy named Lampwick who assures Pinocchio that it would be more fun to be bad then good. He plays pool, smokes cigars, and drinks beer (for those parents who are sensitive about that stuff, you might want to watch this part with your kids so you can discuss the good vs. evil).Most of the animals in this movie have personalities. I've already mentioned the cricket, cat, and fish. The whale had a booming personality.Famous songs were in this movie as well. Of course, we've all heard ""When you wish upon a star,"" which becomes the theme song for Disney movies, even today. ""Little Wooden Head,"" ""Give a Little Whistle,"" and ""I've Got No Strings"" are also all great songs. Of course, the action in the ocean scene is a must see for sure!I've already mentioned the sins of Lampwick, but other things parents may want to be aware of in this classic are: Saloon dancing puppets with obvious cleavage and one scene where Jimminy Cricket touches the backside of a statue and makes a big deal out of it."
131,Pinocchio,10,30 April 2004,"Arguably, the best animated feature ever!","That is what TV Guide called Pinocchio, Walter ""Walt"" Disney's 2nd animated film. I used to watch this movie all the time as young child, until my tape was eaten by a crapped-out VCR. I am now 16 and one day started thinking about this ever-lasting classic. I ordered from Amazon.com after I downloaded and listened to some midi song files from the movie (Hi Diddle Dee Dee and I've Got No Strings On Me). After I ordered it, I began to have my doubts about it. It had been such a long time since I had last seen it, so I didn't think it hold my attention. Boy, was I sure wrong! Only by watching for the first time again in years, did I remember how beautifully done the animation was (especially for 1940), how well the characters were voiced (Honest John, Jiminey Cricket, and Pinocchio himself are my faves), and how heartwarming the whole story is.Too bad I an't talk my brother into watching it though, and he's 3 years YOUNGER than me. He'd rather watch stuff like Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights and Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz.I also reccomend that parents should buy it and watch it with their children, because it shows a good way to talk about why it is bad to tell lies and play hooky and such. For all of you blokes out there are complaining about scenes like the ""Donkey Transformation"" scene is too scary, that part was MEANT to be scary! Pinocchio is ""children's"" movie that has good reason to be scary. If you play hooky or lie, you will turned into a jackass (donkey) and get sold to mines, circuses and such as punishment. The Coachmen character in the ""Pleasure Island"" sequence illustrates this perfectly."
132,Pinocchio,,17 April 2003,Pure Magic and Masterpiece,This movie was wonderful..It was such a magical movie to really make you believe... This is one of disney's top movies no matter who you are you will love this movie.. Its about a touching story of a wooden boy who wants to become real and when lost how his devoted father went all over even to the bottem of the sea to find him. I loved this movie it gets **** out of ****
133,Pinocchio,,29 July 2003,Scary if you are 4 years old,"Although I am only thirteen and haven't seen this movie since I was 4, I would probably still get the crap scared out of me.  I know it is a great movie, I just don't have enough guts to watch it ever again.  The whole whale thing and the donkey kids just don't say ""Children's classic"" to me."
134,Pinocchio,,8 May 2001,Parents - Beware of a frightening scene in this film,"A Disney masterpiece that contains one sequence so frightening it has haunted me since my childhood. I can't recall any little children being killed in a Disney film, but in Pinocchio, they meet a fate far worse than death.  Little boys are turned into donkeys.  Sure they are naughty little boys who relish the sinful life on Pleasure Island but do they deserve to lose their humanity because of it.  This is a film about a puppet gaining humanity and regards it as the most precious gift of all.  After seeing it as a child I will never forget the little boy crying ""I want my mommy!"" and then being turned into an animal.  Parents should be careful about letting their kids see this film despite its wonderful characters, animation and music."
135,Pinocchio,9,27 December 2013,An enchanting childhood Disney Classic if slowly-paced throughout,"I saw this film several times as a child like with other Disney classics such as 'Cinderella,' 'Peter Pan,' 'Snow White,' ''Dumbo,' Sleeping Beauty,' 'Aladdin' and 'Beauty and the Beast.' While it's somewhat better than 'Cinderella,' 'Dumbo' and probably 'Sleeping Beauty,' it's not quite as good as the other films I mentioned due to its sluggish pace throughout but it has a lot of moments that made me laugh, some memorable scenes and some catchy music.Besides the pace, the drawbacks include Pinocchio's mouth not moving when he talks once or twice, the cats Figaro (quadrupedal) and Gideon (bipedal) not talking if Honest John can (it would probably have made sense if all these animals could speak), some loose ends and the song 'Little Wooden Head' seeming to be incomplete because the version on the UK VHS of 'Sing- Along-Songs: Colours of the Wind' had additional lyrics but it's a chirpy song nonetheless. While 'Give a Little Whistle,' 'Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee,' and 'I've Got No Strings' are all cheerful, the brief ending version of 'When You Wish Upon A Star' made me a little teary- eyed ('Baby Mine' from 'Dumbo' made me cry even more) but the opening version strangely didn't make me cry and I found it beautiful - I also liked how it became Disney's signature tune in various arrangements when accompanying several different logos, including the more recent river and Disney castle opening logo. The incidental music has a melodic, nostalgic feel to it and I liked how some of it matched the tunes of some of the songs and the character animation. Moving on to the animation it was smooth for the most part and the backgrounds were intricately drawn. The Blue Fairy in particular was gorgeously animated and I liked her pretty glittery effect. She reminded me of typical 'Glamour Girls' from the 1940s. All of Gepetto's clocks were imaginative if the animation on them was jerky - the ones with the ducks and the drunken man made my mum and I giggle but she found the one with the woman smacking her child's bottom for being naughty with paint politically incorrect because corporal punishment again children is frowned upon these days as is childhood smoking since these things were more appropriate in bygone days. This film had more of an emotional impact on me when I was little because not only did 'When You Wish Upon a Star' make me cry but also the Blue Fairy turning Pinocchio into a real boy. That part just makes me smile these days. There are also some very dark moments in the film such as Stromboli locking Pinocchio in a birdcage, the naughty boys on Pleasure Island turning into donkeys and the climax with Monstro the whale. The underwater scene leading up to this is just as beautiful as the Blue Fairy and is vibrantly coloured.Overall this Disney film is an enchanting watch that has some funny moments, stunning animation and memorable songs in spite of its pace dragging on throughout. 9/10."
136,Pinocchio,,23 May 2002,Creepy,"This movie is just creepy. i remember when they re-released in the theater. My little sister went to watch it, needless to say it was not a pleasent experiance for her. Yes, i would recomend this film as i would recomend alice in wonderland, for there creepyness value. This movie freaked me out far greater then a movie such as Childs play."
137,Pinocchio,4,8 November 2017,Not a fan of this Disney Feature,"The Bad: Some people consider this one of Disney's best movies  I am not one of them. The 'hero' is extremely unlikeable. The situations Pinocchio ends up in are borderline terrifying (both for a child, and for an adult who can think through the deeper implications of kidnapping/slavery). Those who are evil in the movie don't end up punished, they simply seem to get away with it. Most of the songs are not enjoyable. The drinking and smoking don't bother me, personally, although they are shown in a very positive light at first (""Look kids, on Pleasure Island, you can do whatever you want, and that means you can finally get that cigar and whiskey you've always been craving!"").The Good:I believe this is supposed to be viewed as a morality tale  like Aesop's Fables  and as such this movie defies several ""normal"" Disney conventions. For example, it appears that bad behavior (such as telling lies or being selfish) is the true villain. And, like any morality tale, it is meant as a lesson. Granted, the moral of the story is a good one (dealing with bravery, truthfulness, and selflessness along with the idea of not trusting strangers) although it comes across as very heavy-handed. The song ""When you wish upon a star"" is extremely lovely and timeless. The Mom view:I can admire this movie's unique story, but I don't find it in any way appropriate for young children. As a parent, I find Geppetto, to be the most sympathetic character and one who should be the true hero of the story, despite his lack of screen-time. And his struggles with his child might be a good allegory for all parents who have kids who make devastatingly bad choices. For older kids, this might be a creative way for a parent to discuss some relevant issues such as peer pressure."
138,Pinocchio,,11 September 2017,Solid animation with shattered plot,"The animation is just incredible. It is hard to believe that it is made in 1940. I thought it is from 1960s or 1970s. The plot is shattered. Act 2, 3 and 4 tell three disjoint stories, which help the growth of Pinocchio. I think it may be better if the film can tell a more complete and nuanced story, instead of three small and sketchy stories.Some details are particularly interesting. For instance, Jiminy moves his eyeballs according to the ticks of the clocks."
139,Pinocchio,8,15 February 2015,The Height of Disney's Creative Powers,"Pinocchio remains Disneys greatest achievements ever. Snow White was a better film in story, but Pinocchio is much stronger when it comes to artistry and animation. They picked a great story to go all out with special effects and they were used very effectively without becoming distracting. The multi plane camera was put to great use with elaborate shots through the village. There are many memorable characters in the film as well. Jiminy Cricket is your quintessential role model and mentor. I've always liked Gepetto and the Blue Fairy. Honest John, Gideon and Stromboli are funny Disney Villains. The Coachman is overlooked as a great Disney villain. There's so much to enjoy in Pinocchio. It's a must see for all."
140,Pinocchio,5,1 May 2014,I'll tell you one thing: you won't have Tricky Pinoch to push around anymore,"OK, so Disney's adaptation of Carlo Collodi's novel changed a number of things: the puppeteer was originally named Mangiafuoco (""fire-eater"" in Italian), while the fox originally feigned a limp and the cat feigned blindness. I guess that Disney intended the movie as a morality tale.Some other things: *Stromboli is a volcano off the coast of Sicily. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about Ingrid Bergman and basically said that he wanted to get slinky with her on Stromboli. Billy Bragg put the song to music.*I see that Mel Blanc did Gideon's hiccups, making this one of his rare contributions to Disney. He was already providing voices for the Looney Tunes, and soon after got signed exclusively to Warner Bros.*The nose-growing scene enabled me to reference Nixon (with whom Walt Disney was big buddies).*The treatment of gambling as a moral vice no longer applies since gambling has become an important part of the economy.*Italy looks really idealistic in the movie, but Mussolini's brutal occupation of Libya and Ethiopia calls that into question.The point is, Disney's ""Pinocchio"" is a product of its time. An enjoyably weird version of the story is the 1975 Soviet movie ""Adventures of Buratino"", based on ""The Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino"", Aleksey N. Tolstoy's retelling of the story. Even though the movie got made under Brezhnev's stagnation, it's basically Pinocchio meets ""The Partridge Family"". Seriously, it's one of those movies that makes you think ""What am I watching?"" Equally kooky were ""About Little Red Riding Hood"" (in which Little Red Riding Hood acts demented) and ""Mary Poppins, Goodbye"" (yes, there was actually a Soviet version of ""Mary Poppins"").Anyway, we can accept this movie for what it is."
141,Pinocchio,7,23 August 2012,Puppet Master: Disney Edition,"First we have the good things. Compared to the other hits Disney already had (such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) this was an interesting choice of a story to adapt. From what I've heard, and not actually reading the novel, its quite a dark book almost even sadistic. And yet the movie pulls off a lot of the dark tone with say the part where all the boys get turned into donkeys on Pleasure Island. We never see them saved or rescued in anyway which leaves an unsettling feeling about what's going to happen to them. Geppetto's character to me was done quite well. You can feel how lonely the old man is and how much you want his wish to come true. He has energy, laughs, and I think he deserved more screen time. Also I must say that the animation for the Blue Fairy looks amazing. Its done in an older type style and looks much less cartoonish. And this brings me to the bad stuff. The rest of the animation is okay usual Disney standard, but after seeing the wonderful work done on the Blue Fairy it makes me wish the whole movie was done in this style. Next, Jiminy Cricket isn't that great of a role model, he warns against temptation but the only reason he's Pinocchio's conscience is because of temptation. Although he does sing a great song that shaped the image of Disney for years to come, and won an Oscar for Best Song, ""When You Wish Upon A Star"". Lastly, I just found the character design for Pinocchio a bit boring in my opinion. Overall I found watching it again after all this time, for what the story was it wasn't bad. It had some likable characters and some good animation but in the end I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I used to."
142,Pinocchio,7,4 January 2012,Pinn the Tail on the Donkey,"(WARNINGThis is the Adult Disney Review Series. I have 51 Original Disney Cartoons to tackle, plus multiple  and forgettable  direct-to-Disney-Video misses. My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on eachall with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just that)As a kid, I loved the tail of Pinocchio. Some of the more exciting scenes, such as the climax, or the Paradise Park Place, were frightening enough to make me want more. And it was a cartoon  I was allowed to watch those!Fast forward many years, say under a hundred, but more than 30, I'm revisiting for the first time. It's a sweeping improvement over Disney's first outing  Snow White, as in how most creative teams usually fair. It's also more kiddish, which I believe to be the key in making a Disney animated film.And even though it's aiming low, i.e. children, it literally contains enough stories and adventures for several movies. I loved how it just kept going  the many misadventures of a growing boy and his mistakes.It was also rather bold. For 1940the word ""Jackass"" is used. Kids are smoking and drinking. Kids are turned into slaves and caged. And Disney flooded the movie with his signature subliminal messages, once again. Hell, the movie opens with the books in the background screaming at you: Look at what I'm gonna make?! Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland! (Also see John Carpenter doing this in Halloweenname the movie!)More so, two characters are singing ""An Actor's Life for Me""  replace actor's with pirate's. And I wonder if there's a connection between bad kids becoming donkeys, i.e. a political statement. Hmmm.I digress, it was a rather fun movie, gone are the pacing problems from the first Disney feature length and it's responsible for a gag I'll always remember in Airplane!  Leslie Nielsen's nose growing. And finally, it's rather funnyA dozen or so coo-coo clocks are honking and Geppetto (the toymaker/father) asks ""I wonder what time it is?"" Also, he's so oblivious to anything, everything, anyone, he's comedic classic.Overall, it's not perfect, and is waaay too preachy, but it's still a lot of fun and for being Disney's Round Two, it packs a punch.Best Quote: Concerning a Wishing Star ""Very lovely thought, but not at all practical""says the talking cricket.Nowonto Fantasia"
143,Pinocchio,10,6 November 2010,"Pinocchio (1940 Disney) was a ""message movie"" for adults as well as children","Pinocchio (1940 Disney) starring Dickie Jones, Cliff Edwards, Walter Catlett, and Frankie Darro (voiceover talent for major cartoon characters in the movie) is a satisfying, simple, well done movie set in the Swiss Italian mountains of northern Italy, and is based on an Italian folk tale by ""Collodi."" It was Walt Disney's second feature length cartoon following the epic success of Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs (1937 Disney), which made more money than any in movie history up to that time (and this was the Golden Age Of Big Studio Hollywood) and which lit the fire under the MGM studios to create The Wizard Of Oz (1939 MGM) starring Judy Garland to cash in on the same unexpected and spectacular success Disney's Snow White movie had achieved.Pinocchio (1940 Disney) was a simpler movie, not set in a grand palace or peopled by elegant royalty or ending with a final reward for the main character of being taken by Prince Charming to a golden castle in the sky with celestial choirs grandly singing ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" punctuated by sonorous wedding bells. The audience is not expected to cheer for victorious and righteous royalty at the conclusion of Pinocchio (1940 Disney).It's a story about a lonely bachelor artist and craftsman, Gepetto, who makes toys and entertaining clocks which ""perform"" mechanically.Gepetto creates a marionette type puppet in the shape of a little boy, and wishes in his prayers the boy would come alive and become real, thus making Gepetto a father. After he prays and goes to sleep, his home is visited by ""The Blue Fairy"" who grants half of Geppetto's wish as a reward for the old man's goodness and kindness. The puppet comes alive, but is still made of wood, and will only achieve status as a ""real boy"" (i.e. a human boy with real flesh and bones) if the puppet earns that by doing good things, and listening to his conscience. A visiting cricket named ""Jiminey"" is recruited for the job, and after Gepetto awakens and learns to his joy that Pinocchio has come alive, the puppet goes out into the world where he must make good by doing good, and in the end, after several set backs, does that. He rescues his puppet maker father from a giant whale named ""Monstro."" The movie ends happily with no departure from the happy old man's small home which celebrates the end of his loneliness, and the arrival of human company in his life. Jiminey Cricket ends the movie (the incredible, lilting, haunting voice of ""Ukelele Ike"" Cliff Edwards, the voice of ""Jiminey Cricket"") with the simple song ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" and a final portrait of the lovely star lit night time sky casting it's friendly light over the small Swiss Italian village. A simple, beautiful end to a great movie.Before the main character, Pinocchio, achieves success, he has two set backs. Both are set in the world of entertainment. He becomes a success as an actor, a star. But Pinocchio's actor success is not rewarded. Instead, his producer, Stromboli, locks the new actor star in a bird cage, and Pinocchio becomes a miserable prisoner beholding to the big money bosses who profit from his work (a realistic comment on the reality of show business.) The entire movie is great entertainment, often touching, and filled with worthwhile and humane messages about the human condition, it's follies, and it's ultimate (at times) nobility. Pinocchio (1940 Disney) is a wonderful movie worth screening often, as great in a proletarian way as Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs (1937 Disney) was great at portraying the world of story book royals, both good and bad.-------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

144,Pinocchio,10,11 September 2009,Why can't modern Disney films be like this?,"Aside from age, what's the difference between a Disney film before 1999, and a Disney movie in the modern day? older ones get better ratings while newer ones receive a 3/10 average (yes Hannah Montana, we're looking at you.) Mainly Because older ones are based on fairy tales your grandparents grew up with, adapted for a younger generation. but Pinocchio, no matter what generation you're from, is certainly an awesome film.I said it once before and i'll say it again. Disney will never approve of a film like this ever again. why? first of all, let's talk about the 3 references to the word ""Jackass."" nowadays, it means those guys from MTV doing stupid stuff, but back in 1940, jackass was another word for donkey. of course thanks to soccer moms and censors, the word ""Ass"" is now considered a verbal offence. and if soccer moms hear verbal offence in a movie, they're not going to let their kids watch...which means no money in Disney's bank account.what about the bad boys and the pleasure island scene...that scene still makes me shiver with fear, but in a good way. just imagine all the children who watched those poor little boys become donkeys, never to see their mommies again, and used for slaves. it made you never, ever want to be bad. but of course, if children were scared, they didn't want to see the film, and their parents didn't make them...which means no money in Disney's bank account.Sensing a pattern here? Cut to nearly 70 years later. as long as Disney keeps pumping out Hannah Montana, disregarding any moral in their movies, but keeping it within ""Family fun"" limits, then they have what matters to them most...Ka-Ching.OK, enough about that.Pinocchio isn't a boy...yet. he's a man-made creation by a poor puppet-maker named Gepetto. The only thing that isn't on Gepetto's mind is money (sorry, had to throw that in there.) but rather, seeing the joy on children's faces when they see all the toys he spent time working on. his only wish is that his new creation, Pinocchio, a wooden puppet, comes to life so he can have a son (i guess all the women didn't want to marry a man who made toys, just so he could see little children playing with them.) so The blue fairy flies out of the sky, perhaps from Alfea (hey, if Pinocchio and Winx club come from the same country, i can put them together, right?) and brings Pinocchio to life. but the only way he can become a real boy, is if he is good, with the help of one of the greatest Disney characters of all time, Jiminey cricket. but along the way, he deals with a sly fox named ""honest John"" a cruel puppeteer named Stromboli, and then monstro, possibly the most awesome, excellent, Disney villain good old Walt could come up with.Bottom line, you have to watch this movie. why? because kids who watch this film are good. they don't want their noses growing, or to become firewood, or a donkey. if you want good kids, show them this.10/10"
145,Pinocchio,8,23 November 2008,Watch this with my cousin Good Movie,"Owning a vast Disney collection of all the classics this has to effect me the most as a child. The animation is very well and might be out dated but there something special about it all. I was surprise the humor in this movie was made in mind for all ages. You would think Pinocchio's nose would be growing big throughout the film. I thought he be lying nonstop with what we are told. Instead that was only one part of the story of the lessons in the film that aren't preachy.Pleasure Island found terrifying as a child. The transformation into a Jack ass was brilliant. Disney is more scary then movies like American remakes of the ring, grudge etc.Least favorite parts: Hard to think of anything bad to say but the story might be too simple for some. I don't find the animation outdated but I am sure others would argue. Favorite parts: pleasure islandRecommendation: It is a film to own but prob won't watch it unless with a someone 12 and under or just to enjoy a good movie."
146,Pinocchio,,23 July 2004,Important things for our life,"> Pinocchio has been my favorite movie since I was a child. Though this is an animation mainly for children, I think even we, adults, can learn many important things for our life from this movie. For example, the movie teaches us that we should not tell a lie, we should not escape from our reality and we should have courage. In particular, I'll never forget what the goddess of star says: One lie leads to another, and you don't cover the lie in the end. This line impressed me strongly when I was a child. My favorite scene is where Pinocchio goes help his father Gepetto in the sea. I think that he is > very brave because he fights with a huge monster whale to help Gepetto. My favorite character is the cricket who always helps Pinocchio and leads Pinocchio to a better way of life. The goddess of star who always watches Pinocchio in the night sky is also impressive.This movie is really superb and I rate it at 9/10."
147,Pinocchio,9,2 June 2003,Wonderful,"The famous story of the wooden boy Pinocchio is a great Disney classic. This one is as good as great Disney movies like 'Snow White' and 'Bambi'. Beautiful animations, a main character kids can identify with, a little message for them as well and some great songs you will remember make this one of the best Disney movies out there."
148,Pinocchio,,11 January 2003,Disney at it's Best. Too bad it's only the second movie.,"If Disney ever needed to follow its' own advice, it should have wished upon a star with the post-Pinocchio and pre-Lady and The Tramp films, that they could be half of what this classic was.I personally love this movie, although after seeing the grand animation even in such non-epic films as Lilo and Stitch the pen-and-inkiness of Pinocchio is a little difficult to watch. But, it was 1940, so I'll give it a break. What I find most endearing is the fact that there are no drunken psychedelic sequences (you really can't count Pinoke's pool hall antics) and nothing to unduly confuse, bore or alienate children.Its pacing is probably its' strongest point. Not too fast, not too slow. I first saw this movie when I was 8 years old and a poster child for Ritalin, and it kept my attention perfectly. 9 years later, watching it again, I'm awed by its nice, leisurely story. It's perfect, because you don't want it to end, yet it doesn't hang too long on irrelevant plot points.About the closest it comes to dragging is the beginning in Geppetto's shop, where the old man is so psyched about his puppet. still, it's great Disney, the likes of which you wouldn't see again for several years."
149,Pinocchio,,19 July 2001,"Everybody has there magnum opus, ""Pinocchio"" was Disney's","""Pinocchio"" was the first Disney movie I can remember watching, and it is no doubt my favorite.  Most of what the movie has to say means a lot more to me now than it did 14 years ago (example; the infamous donkey scene). This movie is clearly classic.  Disney studios, I don't think, has ever been able to top this movie, they've came very close with other movies.  If you've haven't seen this movie yet, SHAME ON YOU!!!"
150,Pinocchio,,4 July 2001,Super!,I saw this film when I was four years old. Pinocchio goes to Pleasure Island for a lot of fun. It is funny. Cliff Edwards Narrates the story. My sister likes this film too. This film must be really popular. This Film is kind of like Aladdin.
151,Pinocchio,,24 February 1999,**** out of ****,"My second favorite of the classic Walt Disney cartoons (behind Alice In Wonderland), Pinocchio is a terrific film with memorable music, fantastic characters, truly exciting sequences, and a wonderful script.  Darker in tone than man of Walt's earlier films, this is a film adults should enjoy just as much as children."
152,Pinocchio,8,26 January 1999,Pure Magic,"Lively, colorful, entertaining, and character strength, makes this Disney classic go round. A 8."
