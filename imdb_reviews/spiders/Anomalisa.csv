0,Anomalisa,6,31 January 2016,Abstract Anomaly that Doesn't Quite Cut it,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 2.5/5 stars'm a bit mystified by the accolades of ""masterpiece"" that are being heaped upon ""Anomalisa"", a stop-motion animation drama co-directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson. It's a unique film, no doubt, and one that takes a lot of risks and has a number of scenes that work quite beautifully. It has the mordant, awkward bits of humor and wry observation we have come to expect from Kaufman, but not the insight; it's all surface, which is inadvertently personified by the artifice of the stop-motion animation. The film is supposed to tell us something about human relationships and the conflict between our ideals and our reality, but it's all muddled, which is what makes its near universal praise by critics so bewildering. Kaufman has certainly earned his share of deserved praise for his inimitable, boundary-pushing screenplays for Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"", and Michel Gondry's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". But, he's also hit a few critical bumps along the way, including an earlier collaboration with Gondry, ""Human Nature"", and his directorial debut, the unmitigated mess ""Synecdoche, New York"". ""Anomalisa"", while not quite like the latter, isn't also anywhere near to the quality of the former.The majority of the film takes place in a nondescript upscale hotel in Cincinnati, where Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis), a published customer service guru on the lecture circuit, has just arrived. Though a conventionally handsome man in his early 50s who is clearly successful professionally and financially, Michael joins the ranks of miserable Kaufman protagonists whose lives are constantly running aground on their own ennui. Potential redemption arrives in the form of Lisa Hesselman (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a conference attendee he meets at the hotel and to whom he is instantly drawn. Severely lacking in self-esteem and poignantly awkward, Lisa is not the conventional object of male desire, but that is precisely what makes her so fascinating (and Michael's attention so surprising to her).The film is irrefutably a technical marvel, spectacularly illustrating how stop-motion animation can be just as physically and emotionally convincing as any other medium of human expression or technical wizardry. The puppets, which were individually designed and printed using 3D printers, are amazingly lifelike - almost, but not quite, to the point of being uncanny. They stay just this side of the uncanny valley, never venturing toward that precipitous drop- off where animation that is too lifelike becomes weird.The problems with ""Anomalisa"" stem from the two main characters, starting with Michael, who is such a miserable, self-absorbed mope that it's virtually impossible to sympathize with him. Michael's physical mundanity belies the intensity of his narcissism, which keeps him from connecting with anyone and ensures that he remains miserable and alone, even when surrounded by others. Early on in the film, we become aware that all the other characters Â— from a chatty cab driver, to the hotel bellhop, to Michael's wife and son and ex-girlfriend - all have the exact same voice (Tom Noonan's voice, to be exact). It's a clever, albeit potentially confusing, means of conveying the sameness with which Michael views everyone around him, which is heightened by the fact that all the faces on the puppets playing the other characters are oddly similar, as well. The key is the name of the name of hotel where Michael stays: the Hotel Fregoli, a reference to the real- life, but extremely rare Fregoli delusion, a psychological disorder in which a person comes to believe that different people around him are actually the same person in disguise. We aren't meant to think that Michael actually suffers from this disorder (although he says several times that he feels like something is wrong with him psychologically); rather, it plays as a kind of metaphor for Michael's interpersonal isolation, which renders everyone around him a single, undifferentiated mass to whom he cannot connect.Except Lisa. When he hears Lisa's voice, he recognizes her as fundamentally distinct from all the others and immediately seeks her out. Jennifer Jason Leigh does a fantastic job voicing Lisa, and she makes her the most interesting character on-screen (which she is clearly meant to be - a lovable oddball). But, the film stalls emotionally because there is never any depth or meaning to Michael's intense attraction to her. The film is resolutely concrete in depicting his depressive moroseness, but then it gets all abstract when it comes to his propensity for love, which throws everything off-balance. Thus, even the film's most touching sequence - a rather graphic sex scene that plays fair with the inherent awkwardness of two people who barely know each other suddenly getting intimate - doesn't ultimately work because it has nothing emotional to connect to except an idea. Thus, it works in isolation, but not in concert with the rest of the film.The fundamental problem with ""Anomalisa"" is that it's little more than the story of an unsympathetic narcissist assigning his piece of mind to a good-hearted oddball. As a romance, it doesn't work because we just want Lisa to get away from Michael lest he drag her into his sad- sack pit of despair. As an interpersonal cautionary tale it doesn't work because the film's attitude toward Michael is so vague. Had it been more clear about what we were supposed to make of his relationship with Lisa - is it a genuine spark of compatible souls meeting at the wrong time or is Michael just a myopic, misguided jerk with no idea of what he wants - then ""Anomalisa"" might have registered as something more, even if it were just an indictment of its protagonist. Alas, it ends up as a stew of potentially interesting ideas brought to life with amazing artistry that can't quite hide its hollow core."
1,Anomalisa,4,7 January 2016,One good metaphor does not stretch to 90 minutes,"This padded-out feature would have made a very good short. There are good scenes, and ideas worth considering, but absolutely not enough of them for a feature. The stop-motion and design are great, but it has problems on the story/art/intellect side because of stretching the run time past what the story/themes can bear.Too many of the scenes (whether attempts at exploring the humdrum, or attempts at absurdist conflict) subtract more than they add to the whole. The main metaphor of a Fregoli delusion well-represents a kind of mid-life crisis, but it also loses quite a bit in flattening out the mid-life crisis into a general alienation (granted, with a mix of older existentialism issues, and newer ones such as 'personhood as illusory'). In a short film, this bare-bones metaphor would have enough of a poetic quality to work. But here, when the story is stretched out, we are constantly reminded of the lack of particulars. And at some point, not telling us more about the main character and his problems is just coy or frigid on Kaufman's part.I should note that I have no problem with the main character being unsympathetic, nor the attempt at exploring the humdrum side of life in many scenes, nor the film's plot/conclusions being flat/troubling/puzzling, nor scenes that aren't always ""entertaining"". But those scenes have to do something besides show you that dull dialogue imitates dull talk in life. And if Kaufman was interested in tone/lyricism, theme, and irony OVER human particulars (and therefore other things that art can do), he was obliged to take careful, un-self-indulgent account of what the story could sustain. For the second film in a row, he hasn't.I see why, on the the business side, this CAN'T be a $3M short when you can make a $10M feature instead. But this has no bearing on whether the feature has problems. And I understand why a lack of human particulars is fitting for puppets (and how from an ironic, existentialist and behaviorist point-of-view, we might be more puppets than we care to admit), but a few modern ideas don't automatically make 90 minutes worth of story."
2,Anomalisa,8,15 July 2016,Kaufman's Bleak Outlook on Life and Human Relationships,"Every time I see a Charlie Kaufman film I'm reminded how fearless he is at examining the human condition and why I need to put a lot of time in between watching his movies.In ""Anomalisa,"" his Academy-Award nominated animated film, David Thewlis and especially Jennifer Jason Leigh do tremendous voice work as an emotionally ill minor celebrity and the shy, awkward woman with whom he enjoys a one-night stand while at a conference at which he is the speaker. The film is an examination of middle-aged male discontent and loneliness, a subject a younger version of me was always impatient with and which the 41-year-old version of me now finds hits uncomfortably close to home. Kaufman creates a sad character who has many unpleasant tendencies but isn't necessarily a completely unpleasant man, and allows us to see how this one night in the man's life and his approach to human relationships is a stand-in for his entire adult life and the driving force behind his depression.As in his masterpiece, ""Synecdoche, New York,"" Kaufman refuses to give in to the convention of happy, or at least hopeful, endings, and suggests that it is possible to live an entire life being utterly miserable if you don't possess the resources to do otherwise, a terrifying idea to anyone who has struggled with depression, anxiety, or even just prolonged bouts of general malaise. In so many Hollywood movies about unhappy people, the unhappy people just need the emotional connection to that one special person that shakes them out of their funk and changes everything around for them. One of the things I liked best about ""Anomalisa"" is its suggestion that, while those special people really do exist, happiness in any one person is something that has to come from inside and isn't going to be imposed on one by another. It isn't comfortable to think about the possibility of life being a long series of missed opportunities, but it feels honest.Grade: A-"
3,Anomalisa,9,7 August 2016,Offers a real insight into the human soul,"It's been 8 years since Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut, Synedoche, New York - that great but under-appreciated little film about a man (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) who dreamed of building a scale model of New York in a warehouse. The critics seemed to like it but didn't voice their approval very loudly, and chances are many won't remember its existence. Funded by a Kickstarter campaign, Kaufman's latest is a stop-motion collaboration with Duke Johnson, an animator probably most famous for his Adult Swim works.Beginning with mundane chatter in mundane locations, Anomalisa is in no rush to hit you with any visual splendour, which tends to be the norm for animated films. Instead, we follow our miserable protagonist Michael Stone (David Thewlis), a British motivational speaker whose book on customer service is the handbook for those unfortunate enough to be in the business, as he lands in Cincinnati. He grabs a cab ride with an annoying driver who seems to be completely unaware of Michael's depressed, frustrated state, and insists he visit the zoo and tries to Cincinnati's famous chilli. He arrives at his hotel, the Fregoli, where he is unnecessarily escorted to his room by an over-friendly bell boy who informs him of the delights of his standard, mediocre room.It's probably at this point that you'll realise you haven't been imagining that all the characters look and sound alike, and instead that this is a deliberate tactic key to understanding the mindset of Michael and the themes of the film. The name of the hotel is a clue, as the Fregoli delusion is a condition that causes a person to imagine everyone else to be the same entity in disguise with the sole purpose of inflicting torment on the sufferer. Here, everyone has the face of an adult white male (even the women and children) and has been blessed with the soothing, distinctive voice of Tom Noonan. It is only when Michael stumbles upon two women in his hotel who are there to see his speech the following day that this spell is broken. One of the two women, Lisa, has a barely noticeable facial disfigurement and sounds like Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Michael is enamoured.Michael's relationship with Lisa, who be dubs 'Anomalisa', gives the film a much-needed heart, as this may have otherwise been an exercise in misanthropy. There's no fantasy romance here, but a dinner date where everyone involved drinks too much, Michael's awkward invitation for Lisa to accompany him back to his room, and a sex scene which is, ironically, the most realistic I've ever seen on film. Michael accidentally rolls onto her hair, she bangs her head, he asks her the awkward question of whether she's cool with oral sex - there's certainly no pan to a roaring fireplace,You would think that the heightened sense of realism would make the choice to film this in stop-motion slightly redundant, but oddly, it makes the film even more human. It also allows Kaufman and Johnson to show much more of life's ugliness - we are treated to Michael's middle-aged stark naked body jumping out of the shower and the sight of a random man across the way getting ready to masturbate in front of his computer. It's often difficult to sit through. I work in customer services myself and can empathise with Michael's internal struggle of feeling trapped within himself and that others are barely distinguishable from one another. Don't expect any tidy resolutions either, Kaufman is intelligent enough to realise that the excitement of meeting an interesting girl is only temporary, and life will still go on. It's upsetting, certainly, but Anomalisa offers a real insight into the human soul and makes a lasting impression."
4,Anomalisa,5,21 March 2016,Puzzled by The Acclaim,"This is a small film Â– by which I mean it's not a great one. This is, of course, in contrast to all the critical praise which has been heaped on it. The word ""masterpiece"" has featured in many reviews, but I can't agree. I'd stress that I'm a huge Charlie Kaufman fan and my anticipation on going to see the film was equally as big as my disappointment after I'd done so. So what's the problem? I think it's the smallness of the story;yes it's about alienation,yes it's clever, yes the sex scene is achingly real and uncomfortable, but this movie has only a few points to make Â– mostly about alienation and the ""otherness"" of people Â– and while it makes them well, they don't amount to a decent movie. Thinking about it afterwards Â– and puzzled by the praise it has received and disconcerted by my own disappointment Â– I realised that if this movie has been made with human actors it simply wouldn't get the same sort of critical acclaim, in fact, it would be deemed dull, dull, dull. The thing which lifts it out of the ordinary Â– but not into the extraordinary Â– is the fact that it's told via animation. I urge anyone who loves the movie to try and imagine sitting through the same script acted by real people Â– it would be achingly boring."
5,Anomalisa,4,4 December 2016,"An oddball that did not work for me, personally","Anomalisa is a strange film about a man, Michael Stone, struggling with paranoia, mid-life crisis, and ageing. He has travelled to Cincinnati for a conference on customer service, but is also pursuing an old flame, struggling with his marriage and child, and lonely and confused. He is also suffering from a neurotic disorder, which I will discuss later.So that innovative part of the film is its use of character models. The film is shot with dolls, and all the actors are voiced by the same person. This is in reference to Michael's paranoia, something called a Fergoli delusion, where he believes all people are in fact the same, and believes he is being watched or in danger. The film uses this as its plot point, where Michael is struggling to cope with life, but also begins having neurotic episodes. He pursues an extra marital affair, drinks heavily, and his depression and anxiety are evident.Frankly, this film didn't mesh with me well. I enjoyed the innovative style of the film, with the dolls, and appreciated the attempt to make the audience feel the same strangeness associated with Michael's delusions. All the people look the same, and sound the same, and Michael and the audience struggle to recognize characters. The build up of this paranoia is also interesting. The audience may also empathize with Michael's mid-life issues, and depression.However, I felt the story did not hold up well as time went on. The metaphor works well in brief, but aside for some humorous and interesting moments and conversations, the film feels like it goes nowhere. Maybe that is the point of the film, but it did little to make me feel like the experience was worth viewing. I do not mind a good slow burning film, or one that is supposed to represent reality, and Anomalisa is one of those films. However, the formula did not work for me in this case. The story fell flat, I struggled to empathize with Michael's character, and much of the film was a bit on the dull side unfortunately.All in all, an innovative style and some good humour and poignant moments on mental health and depression do not carry this film above the mark in my opinion. The film is a tad dull, the story stretches, and Michael's character did not elicit any empathy from me. Although I felt bad about his situation in life, the way he treated others did little to his credit. Frankly, I wish I felt more about this film, but I viewed it, and have little else to say. It was innovative, and interesting and very artistic. However, it left behind little for me, and I am sure I will soon forget it. A bold attempt, and I hope to view more life it in the future, but not a film for me, I believe."
6,Anomalisa,8,1 January 2016,The Voice of a Songbird,"Greetings again from the darkness. Seeing Charlie Kaufman's work described as ""strange"", ""weird"" or ""bizarre"" makes me cringe a little because most of his films hit my sweet spot of curiosity, insight and expression. I easily relate to his creative vision and commentary in films like Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Synecdoche, New York. His characters are always searching for something and trying to discern the meaning of life Â… or at least of their own life. This latest has Kaufman adapting his own stage production, and collaborating with co-director Duke Johnson for what is likely (for the vast majority of us) our most startling existential stop-action animated puppet cinematic experience.The unusual opening of the film is a black screen with only background noise and voices, and the first chuckle occurred within about a minute thanks to one of my favorite cultural references of the year: ""Kojak, not Kolchak"". Slowly the screen evolves to show clouds in the sky, and soon an airplane appears and our first peek at Michael occurs Â… he's a passenger on a flight. The vast majority of the rest of the film takes place inside the Fregoli Hotel Â– aptly named because Michael seems to suffer from a twist on Fregoli Delusion (a person believes those around him are all the same person in disguise).We soon notice that Michael appears beaten down, even exasperated with life. He is an author in town to give a presentation on his specialty Â… Customer Service. The story continues along familiar lines of a business traveler in the midst of a mid-life crisis, until things change for him when he stumbles on a couple of his fans who are in town for his presentation. One of them is Lisa, whom Michael is attracted to thanks to her innocent energy and wonderful voice. What makes her voice so wonderful? Well, it turns out that Michael is voiced by British actor David Thewlis, Lisa is voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh, and EVERY other character in the film (male or female) is voiced by Tom Noonan. Lisa and her voice are the anomaly that makes up the film's title Â… Michael is smitten with her because her voice is not like all the others - providing a spark of hope.Mr. Kaufman seems intent on making us realize how easily we can slip into a rut and simply go through the motions in life Â… every day and every person being pretty much like the rest. Michael has learned to wear his Customer Service mask Â– one who pretends to care about the issues of others. It's a terrific metaphor for someone refusing to face the responsibility for their own happiness. His awakening occurs at the hands (and in bed) with Lisa. Yes, you should be prepared for the uncommon and slightly unsettling site of Puppet Private Parts. The clumsy passion of the first encounter between Michael and Lisa does wonders for each of them Â… restoring her self-esteem and awakening him from his daily slumber of hopelessness.While the story itself is quite simple, the use of puppets prevents us from getting overly personal or judgmental with the characters, and forces us to deal with the emotional and mental aspects of what keeps so many from leading happy lives. Lisa's acapella version of ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" ignites the fuse in Michael, and just like that, both he and Lisa are jolted from their own self-imposed limitations. No longer able to just go through the motions, Michael's overreactions at breakfast and during his presentation are all part of his re-awakening Â… the most profound puppet awakening since Pinocchio. Perhaps Mr. Kaufman thought we might be more receptive to his message and observations if delivered by a non-threatening puppet, and perhaps he's correct. The message is delivered loudly and clearly Â… though I will probably hear Tom Noonan's voice in my nightmares. The look of the movie and the puppets is fantastic, and Carter Burwell provides yet another spot-on score."
7,Anomalisa,8,10 October 2015,"Poignant, poetic, and heartfelt.","""Anomalisa"" is in my opinion one of this year's most important films. The film centres on Michael Stone, a depressed customer service guru who struggles to connect with others, finally meeting someone he can truly connect with - a woman named Lisa.Anyone familiar with Kaufman's work knows that he has a tendency to write incredibly deep and complex stories embedded with a plethora of themes. ""Anomalisa"" might just be the one exception (or anomaly) to that fact. The story is surprisingly simple; most of it takes place over the course of 24 hours. The messages behind it, fortunately, will still require multiple viewings and further analysis in order to be fully grasped. The final synthesis is elegantly woven to near perfection and is at times humorous and even thrilling. Running at only 90 minutes, the film never feels slow nor bloated. I believe ""Anomalisa"" is a good starting point for those just starting to get into Kaufman's filmography.The stop-motion animation is some of the best that I have ever seen on the big screen. For a project that was funded on Kickstarter, I have to say that the quality of the animation is the equivalent to what you would see in an Aardman Animations or Laika production - if not better. There were certain shots that made me stop and really appreciate the efforts that the team went through just to make all of their characters' movements flow realistically. Kudos to them!The reasons why I think ""Anomalisa"" is one of this year's most important films not only have to do with the way the film was financed and produced, but that it also opens up a dialogue on isolation and social disillusionment - they are usually seen as flaws inherent only within the individual, despite the fact that everyone plays some part in furthering it.""Anomalisa"" is a true work of art on many levels. It is a simple story that touches on a wide range of emotions, riddled with the complexities of our perceptions on relationships. Do not be surprised if this film makes you laugh more than cry. Do not be surprised if this film makes you cry more than laugh - for that is the true beauty of this anomaly of a film."
8,Anomalisa,7,19 March 2016,Irrational Man,"(RATING: â˜†â˜†â˜†Â½ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A serious treatise on loneliness that, while making some intriguing insights, does ramble on and on.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: On a business trip, a lonely man searches for love among the ruins of his ordinary life.ï¿¼I begin this review with a quote from Immanuel Kant: ""Happiness is not an ideal of reason, but of imagination"". This sums up the film, Anomalisa very succinctly. The film is an imaginative journey into the mind of a sad man who has lost all reason, living in a world where everyone is uniformly the same, in voice and appearance.Nominated for a 2015 Oscar for Best Animated Film (and finally receiving wider distribution nearly 4 months later), Charlie Kauffman's stop-motion film has an odd yet intoxicating allure. It is a character study of a lonely man content to live within his own illusions, with reality just outside his grasp.David Thewlis voices the character of Michael Stone, a man unable to connect with others. Michael settles for his cloistered existence. His responsibilities to his family and his job ties him down. He is a successful author and keynote speaker, discussing self-help techniques to the masses without the ability to help himself in his private life. On a business trip, he meets various strangers (all voiced by Tom Noonan). A feeling of hopelessness overpowers him. But it isn't until he finally hears a different voice in the form of Lisa Hesselman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) that he finally awakens to life and all of its wondrous possibilities. He nicknames her Anomalisa (a cross between an anomaly and Lisa herself). Their encounter becomes the crux of the film as MIchael's sanity slowly becomes unhinged, in the most literal sense.ï¿¼Writer / director Charlie Kauffman creates a dreamlike film that is visually captivating but leaves many questions unanswered. (Sharing directing credit is also Duke Johnson.) With its deep philosophical bent, Mr. Kauffman's screenplay allows for too much intellectualizing and grand- standing of the human condition, interfering with the beauty of his simple tale. The film is beautifully staged with wonderful detailed sets by the production team of John Joyce and Huy Vu and a haunting score by the reliable Carter Burwell that adds to the melancholia. The film's initial premise is intriguing, like experiencing a profound lecture or reading a compelling essay or poem, yet the level of satisfaction will differ with each viewer. Does one like metaphysical debates about the importance of life, happiness, and the general state of the human condition? Is it time well spent or wasted on thought-provoking meaningless observations? Is the glass half-empty, half-full, or not really there at all? Was I caught in a freshman class of Philosophy 101? (As you might tell, my feelings were decidedly mixed.)ï¿¼While I enjoyed the film's animation and the atmospheric toll on the characters, this wisp of a plot edged on monotony, even though the film dealt with some provocative concepts. Technically, the stop-motion aspects are quite effective and achieve a graceful elegance. (Midway, the film takes on a more surreal quality which I personally found more compelling before it reverses itself once again.) But the overall script needed more risks into a wider range of bizarre and weird images that are capable within this animated genre. Instead, Kauffman and Co. settle for a tame strangeness as it trips over in its own wordiness and drawn-out ramblings.No doubt this film is a labor of love and, on that, it should be commended. Anomalisa is the type of film project that one can greatly admire, but love never became part of the equation for this reviewer. Like the character of Michael, I just could not connect emotionally. I remained an avid observer and outsider throughout this movie-going experience, with true happiness just out of my grasp as well.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
9,Anomalisa,7,3 January 2016,Brave & Depressing!,"There's no other to say it: 'Anomalisa' is beyond the ordinary, its something like you've never seen before (well, almost). Oscar-Winner Charlie Kaufman Writes & Directs this unusual story, with sensitivity, although the final-act turns up bland. More on that later...'Anomalisa' Synopis: A man crippled by the Mundanity of his life experiences something out of the ordinary.'Anomalisa' is a story about a man stuck in monotony & depression. Kaufman along-with Co-Director Duke Johnson, delivers a sad story about facing repetition in life. And they begin the story beautifully & it remains great even after its protagonist forms a relationship with a ""different soul"". BUT, the final-act is a downer. The narrative falls apart & even though Kaufman's message comes across, it doesn't leave an impact. The open-ending also doesn't work. In short, 'Anomalisa' works wonders, until it falls apart in its penultimate moments.Kaufman's Writing is truly terrific in the first-hour, but as mentioned prominently before, this story deserved a better end! Kaufman & Duke Johnson's Direction is skilled, as the stop-motion adult animation, is brilliantly done.David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh & Tom Noonan deliver mesmerizing vocal performances. Leigh, especially, is magnificent. After 'The Hateful Eight', Leigh triumphs once again with a super act in 'Anomalisa'.On the whole, Despite some faults, 'Anomalisa' deserves a watch for its brave approach & its perfectly done depressing setting."
10,Anomalisa,1,24 January 2016,Animated Boredom as Performance Art,"Charlie Kaufmann bores the universe with an even more dull and depressive movie experience than Synecdouche New York, his last super depressing movie. Using animation is interesting for the first few minutes only as any kind of plot development is slower that plate tectonics. As soon as you realize the raison d'etre you save yourself some time by simply watching it fast forward, stopping occasionally to listen to the dull, half wit dialogue, but only long enough to confirm your initial (and correct) decision that there is nothing worth listing to, let alone remembering as worth listening to. Got it? You can save even more time by not watching it. I only wish I had the 14 minutes I spent watching it back, and the 3 minutes I spent on this review. DON'T BOTHER.... <<<<<<------ IN SUMMATION"
11,Anomalisa,7,14 January 2016,Charlie Kaufman's latest film is not as much of anomaly as its title suggests,"Charlie Kaufman is almost surely on the Mt. Rushmore of full- throttled auteurism. Merely describing the plot of his newest film is enough to give you hint of the mind behind the work; a bizarre examination of the mind-numbingly ordinary.Just as was the case with fellow auteur Wes Anderson in 2009, when he released the excellent Fantastic Mr. Fox, Kaufman seems to be entering the animation phase of his career. The result Anomalisa, a tale of a man who just doesn't feel right in the world he lives in and one who fights tooth and nail to resist falling into the banality that surrounds him. The man in this story is Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) and we first catch up with him on a plane flying into Cincinnati. It is almost immediately evident that Michael is much like many of the other men we have met throughout Kaufman's filmography; middle-aged, despondent, lonesome and not all that attached to the life his has built for himself. Michael is a kind of self-help, customer service expert coming to Cincinnati to give a speech, yet seems unable to help himself whatsoever.Kaufman accentuates Michael's existential loneliness by making every character we meet along Michael's trip from the airport to the hotel voiced by the same man, character actor and Kaufman favorite Tom Noonan. Throughout this mundane journey, which takes up much of the first third of the film, we follow Michael as he is forced to make Â— or rather do his best to not make Â— small talk with everyone from the oversharing Taxi driver to the polite bell hop.It is here where one of the themes, intentional or not, of Kaufman's movies begins to rear its head. The main character, usually a male, is almost always this exact blend of relatability and dismissive callousness. Sure some of what the cab driver says is pointless and at times annoying, but Michael isn't exactly a charming and dynamic man himself, yet upon his high horse he sits.This theme continues as Michael's world expands. From in his ordinary hotel room he makes a series of phone calls, first to his wife and son and then to his old girlfriend whom he left ten years earlier. Both conversations seem to compound rather than alleviate whatever troubles are boiling up within. Despite this he decides to meet up with his former girl in the hotel bar, a scene that goes pretty much how you'd expect, leaving Michael once again alone. It is not until he meets Lisa who is (Jennifer Jason Leigh) the first to cut through the noise and make a visceral impact on Michael's life. The two eventually share a passionate and awkwardly realistic night that promises to break our hero from his perpetual funk.When I realized that every voice in Anomalisa was a single actor I had, well, one of these moments. I am a fan of Kaufman's workÂ— from Synecdoche, NY to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Â— but he often seems dead-set on walking that thin line between being skillfully clever and a bit arrogant. It wasn't until the moment that Michael and Lisa share the night in the hotel room that I realized the choice of voice actors fell firmly in the former. Lisa's voice represents literally what she means to Michael metaphorically; something new, something different, something to shake him to his core and remove whatever dark cloud has been clearly following him around for years. It is what makes her morning-after transformation, the slow blur of her voice into that of everyone else in this fictional world, all the more heartbreaking. It confirms that the world isn't boring and broken and full of trite copies, but it is Michael who is fractured beyond repair. It is his own outlook, which can no longer see anything unique or beautiful, that is the source for all his despair. On the surface this works. Kaufman once again shows how the inner workings of the mind are often quite different from reality, a worthy topic to be explored. The main issue that once again pervades the film, though, is that I feel like I should be sad for Michael when in reality I am not sure he deserves the beautiful and unique if he can't recognize it all around him. Throughout Anomalisa Michael continuously looks outward to solve his problems, whether it is his wife and son, his old girlfriend or finally, Lisa. He not only hopes they will help him, but seems to think they have a duty to do so. Almost like the fact that everyone is indistinguishable is their own fault rather than his own warped outlook. Earlier I compared Kaufman to fellow filmmaker Wes Anderson but that comparison has very little to do with style. Where Anderson can take nearly any subject, from foxes to kids getting kicked out of school, and make them utterly delightful. Kaufman's goal, on the other hand, seems to be to take any subject and make you think and think and probably eventually get a little sad, a goal which, for better or worse, he scores with Anomalisa."
12,Anomalisa,9,4 December 2015,Who are you?,"The latest of Charlie Kaufmann's demonstrations of the effect of point-of-view on story-telling, Anomalisa takes its place in that magnificent line of works beginning with Being John Malkovich, through Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Synecdoche New York, all works of genius.Taking its cue from a delusional condition, Kaufmann applies the point of view of a sufferer to an otherwise banal midlife crisis and comes up with a remarkable and completely unexpected way of presenting it to us.Kaufmann is awesome.As well as the terrific visuals, courtesy of co-director Duke Johnson and his team, there is yet another bullseye from composer Carter Burwell.The pace of the movie is leisurely. The material feels unusually stretched for a Kaufmann script, which may be because it apparently started out as a 40 minute work. Really, though, it doesn't matter. I'd rather spend a little too long with Anomalisa than five minutes with several other films I could mention. This, after all, is an amazing piece of art."
13,Anomalisa,8,22 March 2016,At first I was appalled by this film...,"I'm not a dedicated Kaufman fan, but I have enjoyed his other films. This movie has Kaufman all over it... dripping in his artist style. I gave it an 8 not because I liked it, but because I sat for 20 minutes pondering how much I thought Michael Stone, and perhaps Charlie Kaufman himself, is an utter a**wipe. And after thinking about it, I realized that it is an artistic work. I appreciate art, even if it leaves a strange and bitter taste in my mouth. I think the average viewer will not like it, they will probably be cursing after and wondering why they spent their money to see it, or why they willed themselves to sit though it...or why they didn't leave sooner. I get the film, and of all the bits that were super weird, the best part was Michael's breakdown when he was giving his speech. I love the reference to the corruption of the Bush administration, and I love how it brilliantly captured a moment I personally wish would happen; a person on stage breaking a barrier of civility and letting their frustration out. You know, expressing their loneliness and pain, albeit in a really awkward way. I can imagine most female viewers to be pretty upset at the slightly manipulative aspect of Michael and Lisa's affair, it's what appalled me most. This film is told from a very male perspective, so I can understand why Michael acts the way he does. It really shows the fragility of some men, and the lows they go to. I don't know, is that normal to treat a woman like that?! I happen to have the utmost respect for women and find it very selfish of Michael to pursue Lisa. It seems out of his extreme loneliness he was able to focus on her and find something beautiful about her. Only to turn it around and distort it, making her into an ideological savior. He wakes up the next morning to realize she really isn't that different and unique as he thought...she is kind of just like the others. Conversely, through Lisa's loneliness she willingly and naively accepts Michael's actions as normal...and that scene at the end where she is happily writing that letter to him, WTF!? And then it makes me think, maybe Michael and Lisa really are meant for each other, and Michael was too scared to truly change his life. But perhaps that's the point of this film, to be a little disgusted I mean. The entire qualification for a good work of art is to convey and transmit some sort of truth. Not all truths are beautiful and uplifting. This story is very true to many people's lives, especially of American life. Loneliness and that feeling that so many people are just replicas of a copy. Mindlessly living life...Did I enjoy this film, no. Will I watch it again, perhaps not for another 10 years. Can I respect what it was aiming to achieve, yes."
14,Anomalisa,,7 November 2015,Would have been a great short film,"I am a huge Charlie Kaufman fan, and was very excited to get the chance to see this film at the Denver Film Festival this week. However, this film was extremely disappointing. The plot was quite boring and the film really just seemed to be a character study of loneliness and mental health deterioration. It would have made a great short film, but it was entirely too long for such a low-quality plot. The ending left me extremely unsatisfied.However, I did enjoy the animation, sound, and other technical aspects of the film. But I'd have to rate this 5 stars and place it next to down there next to Schenectady, New York as one of my least favorite Charlie Kaufman films. Apparently I prefer films he writes but does not direct. I'm ready for another Spike Jonze collaboration!"
15,Anomalisa,1,21 January 2016,50 Shades of Clay,"This movie had potential. It started out with an interesting premise and a few laughs. the animation was also really beautiful. However, this film had basically no story. A third of its runtime was one long sex scene. The main character had no arc. He was the same person at the end of the film that he was at the start. Typically when you film something with no story and sex it's called porn. The pacing is also terrible and I was bored with this movie from about 10 minutes in. I don't need to see the first world problems of this successful man with mental issues and him preying on a young woman. I haven't even mentioned the continuous unnecessary F-bombs. The only redeeming quality of this film is the talented animation. I only wish the artist didn't have to animate so many penises."
16,Anomalisa,2,4 March 2016,aNONONOmalisa (with spoilers),"I really wanted to like this film. I've seen prior Kaufman films and been very impressed. I love animations. All the media hype about ""human"" and ""touching"" and ""bittersweet"" also drew me in. But OUCH. It's one thing to have a ""lost"" protagonist that you can ""feel for,"" but lost doesn't even begin to describe Michael Stone. He masquerades as an ordinary middle-aged businessman, perhaps in the throes of a mid-life crisis. Everywhere this guy goes he manages to leave confusion, pain and suffering in his wake, but somehow we, the audience, are supposed to have empathy for his frustration and alienation. There's nothing to like in this guy! And when his softer side emerges through his brief connection with Lisa, it quickly dissolves into his bitter, critical, pathological self. So by the end, there's no epiphany, no resolution, nothing. Lisa is the same sweet, naÃ¯ve woman (who has presumably taken no lesson from her overnight encounter), and Stone is, well, still a stone. And to those who are reading much more into this tale, including sex dolls and Lisa not being real, etc., I say: you're Emperor's-New-Clothes- ing this film. You REALLY WANT to see something that REALLY ISN'T there. You loved Kaufman's other work, so you decided there must be a lot more here than there is. Color me disappointed. (The two stars are for the animated characters and sets.)"
17,Anomalisa,1,21 February 2016,Discovered this wasn't about Trans-Gendered dolls 30 minutes in.,"This film took about an hour to warm up to tepid. I spent the first 30 minutes of the film wondering if it was specifically about the lives of trans-gendered people, all speaking in a male voice. It was a perverted film about a filanderous robot-doll-man and watching him pee, shower, have sex and buy a 'toy' for his 7?yo son at a porn shop. For the FIRST TIME EVER, I really wanted to walk out of the movie 15 minutes in--and regret staying. There was no point to this movie just some rich old white perverted chain-smoking dude hanging out in a hotel room who bangs a young naive lady planning to attend his conference. I wish had left 15 minutes in so I didn't have to witness the rest of it. I didn't even want money back, I'm just sorry I saw the rest of it. They require me to write another line, but I think I wrote enough already, I'm not sure what they want for me to write yet an additional line of text. I told my piece. This is the last line that I will need to author today, thankfully."
18,Anomalisa,1,12 February 2016,deeply depressing and frightening,"From one of the opening scenes in a taxi, in which the protagonist is confronted with the mind-numbing, vaguely aggressive stupidity of the taxi-driver's conversation, to the awful, frightening scene in the hotel in which our anti-hero seduces a less than enthusiastic and (again) amazingly stupid young woman, we have an image of all human beings and our culture as utterly debased and meaningless. The film's top-notch animation reproduces lovingly all the details of the emptiness of modern life, from the perfectly formed ice cubes in the hotel ice-maker to the sex toys at the ""toy shop"" down the street from the hotel. One can read the film as the representation of one man's mental illness (as the name of the Fregoli Hotel, named for a neurological syndrome, invites us to do), but I see this idea as a red herring. This is not about one man's flawed vision -- it is a dark vision of our world the way the filmmakers imagine it, about how all of us are debased cookie- cutter products of a dehumanized culture. The film manages to be thoroughly boring and terrifying at the same time. Incidentally, women in the film are reduced to sex-doll status, which might be one reason why I had a hard time finding a single positive review from a woman on the IMDb site, and why the female viewers who pointed out the scary sexism of the film got shouted down by male fans of animation who identified with the protagonist's unhappiness."
19,Anomalisa,2,12 March 2016,Well trodden territory of the middle aged man in his midlife crisis,"This is a film about a middle aged man who looks back on his life and (surprise) has deep regrets and feels empty. He left his girlfriend 10 years ago and the started a new life which is utterly boring and meaningless. Then he returns to the city where he left his real love where he first meets her which doesn't go well and then chats up another woman with whom he has a one night stand. Then next day he has a nervous breakdown at a motivational speech and he returns to his normal boring life and to his safe marriage.This is well trodden territory and has been dealt many times. The film has nothing do add to it except that there is a long drawn very awkward sex scene which gave the film an R rating. The general theme has been set by the Death of a Salesman many years ago and the feel is pretty much the same. That he is a motivational speaker reminds very much of Up In The Air which has a very similar theme. Again, there the main protagonist gives a speech in front of an audience, fails and it feels strangely familiar. Films such as The Great Beauty are much more inventive and reflect on our times much better. There the protagonist admits it's been empty but it's been fun, for example. Even the flawed Youth with a similar theme deals with middle age, looking back on your life and regret in a much, much deeper way than this very formulaic film.It's a very generic art-house film about the crisis of a middle aged man. His motivations and what he does are as predictable as it can get."
20,Anomalisa,5,23 July 2016,Worth watching,"I should start by saying that I'm not a big Charlie Kaufman fan. But I liked this movie. Can't say I really understood everything that he meant to do with this movie (while others on IMDb say it's actually a simple idea that was stretched for 80 min). I waited for a reveal or something, which didn't really come, but all in all I enjoyed this movie.While watching the movie I couldn't understand why his ex-g/f has a male voice: first I thought it was a man and that Michael is homosexual, then when she arrived at the hotel I thought perhaps it's supposed to be a transgender, then I looked up IMDb to see who's voicing the ex-g/f and noticed that list of cast is extremely short, so I closed it right away before reading - I realized there's something going on there. But it was very confusing to watch.Interesting animation, good atmosphere - and Jennifer Jason Leigh is always a pleasure. Be warned, this is a slow-paced movie and although made in stop motion animation, it's definitely for adults only."
21,Anomalisa,1,7 January 2016,Boring,Don't waste your time watching this movie! its depressive and dull. its an animated film good enough but a very depressive storyline and if it were an non animated film it wouldn't get to see the light of day! and the love scene! are you serious! it reminded of southpark hahahaha I just do not get it with this film? is it artistic or just plain weird I guess there's a lot of weird people out there who like this film but is weird cool? yes it can be but this weird film is not working for me :-)I don't understand why it gets so high ratings here on IMDb? the ratings here usually tell the truth :-/ anyways if you don't believe me then check it out and tell me what you think i truly believe that the reviews before me are made up either that or like i say a lot of wierdos out there :-)
22,Anomalisa,4,17 January 2016,Wasted Effort,"Anomolisa is about a man's search for identity and meaning in his life but the movie never really finds its own identity. The conceit of using animation really adds nothing to this movie except the ability to include scenes which, if used with live actors, would have turned this into an X-Rated movie. (Parents take note.) At the end of a movie in this genre I think it is reasonable for the viewer to believe the movie has, at least, presented a novel view of life, or how one copes with his day-to-day existence. Unless you are very impressionable or haven't seen many movies about self-examination, you will not go away from this movie with that outcome."
23,Anomalisa,1,19 January 2016,"""Anomalisa"" is Kaufman at his most unusual - and most awkward.","An anomaly, according to Miriam-Webster's online dictionary is ""something that is unusual or unexpected."" For example, an animated feature film for adults could be called an anomaly among animated movies. Another example could be an R-rated animated movie receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature Film, an Oscar-related anomaly. Both examples of the use of the word anomaly apply to ""Anomalisa"" (R, 1:30), the adult animated feature film from Charlie Kaufman. It's a movie based on a radio play (another anomaly) that Kaufman wrote in 2005. The film uses only three voice actors, they happen to be the same voice actors who originally performed the radio play, the animation is of the stop-motion variety and uses marionettes. Chalk up four more anomalies, an unexpectedly large number for a single movie and I have yet to start describing the film's plot.Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) is a British author living in Los Angeles. Michael has a devoted wife and son at home, but he still feels desperately lonely. He is also, to borrow a phrase from Bruce Springsteen, tired and bored with himself. He seems to get no joy out of anything in his life and often worries that he is losing his mind. Everyone he meets seems to have the same face and speak with the same voice. And, within the film, both of those are the case, courtesy of the animation work of Kaufman's co-director Duke Johnson and the voice work of actor Tom Noonan. Early in the film, the hotel where Michael checks in is even called the Fregoli, a reference to a rare psychological disorder in which someone believes that everyone he or she meets is actually the same person wearing disguises.Michael is in Cincinnati to speak at a conference of customer service professionals about his newest book, ""How May I Help You Help Them?"" We see him having awkward conversations with another passenger on his flight, then the cab driver who takes him to the Fregoli Hotel, then the bellboy who takes him to his room, then his wife whom he calls from his room, then an old girlfriend whom he calls next. What follows are several awkward encounters with fellow hotel guests he meets while knocking on doors looking for a person whose voice he heard from inside his room Â– a voice that sounded different from the voice he hears coming out of every other person he encounters throughout his day.Then, Michael finds that unique voice (Jennifer Jason Leigh) coming out of a face which he also sees as different from everyone else. Her name is Lisa and she happens to be in town for that conference Â– mostly because she wants to hear his speech. Michael invites Lisa and her co-worker/roommate (also voiced by Tom Noonan) to come down to the hotel bar for drinks. As they drink and talk, Michael's attachment to Lisa grows. Lisa explains how she learned many new big words from reading Michael's book, including the word anomaly, which she likes because she herself feels ""different"" and ""unusual"". Michael dubs her ""Anomalisa"" and thinks she may be the one person who can break him out of his funk.""Anomalisa"" is one of the most unusual movies you'll ever see. I just wish that were a good thing. The film is very creative, but also just plain weird. The situations in which we see Michael early in the film are too mundane to be interesting and his excruciatingly banal interactions with a series of people who have the same voice and basically the same face become increasingly uncomfortable to watch. When a few things that can actually be called unusual take place, they're just too strange to be entertaining. At several points during this movie, I came close to walking out of the theater. After Michael meets Lisa, the story finally gets a little bit interesting, but maintains its unpleasant awkwardness in almost every scene and ends in a way that I found unsatisfying and pointless.A few times during the film, the words ""What the ---- is this?!?"" popped into my head. As the closing credits started to roll, that question came back to me as, ""What the ---- WAS THAT?!?"" Just then, a man in the row behind me vocalized my thoughts word-for-word. Someone else responded with a tentative ""I liked it."" I can hardly imagine why. I'll give some credit to Kaufman and company for the creative animation (even as odd as it felt to see suchÂ… ahem, ""anatomically correct"" marionettes) and I respect the film's message of breaking out of life's ruts, but this movie seems to want to be weird just for the sake of being weird. ""Anomalisa"" is an anomaly in many ways, but few of them are entertaining. ""D+"""
24,Anomalisa,1,2 January 2016,Please give me my 90 minutes back...,"I found this movie through a forum and saw that it had an 8/10 rating and was supposedly inspirational...now I feel like I must do my part to lower this rating and save other peoples time. I found myself waiting for something to happen, and suddenly the credits are rolling. If there is anyone out there who would ever see this movie twice, please see a psychotherapist. I don't mind watching a well made movie without a happy ending...but please...there is nothing about this movie that I can hang my hat on and say it was good...Please DO NOT waste your time.This movie is the equivalent to the art display in a museum of human excrement that everyone is surrounding and taking pictures, clamoring that its a groundbreaking and heart provoking display."
25,Anomalisa,1,27 March 2016,most awkward sex scene but even worse soliloquy,"I hated this film from about 10mins in, but i kept watching in vague hope it would improve. Spoiler alert:I was left with so many questions. How long does semen stay gluggy? Did Michael have sex with the automaton Japanese doll? Why would a British guy call his son ""slugger""? Which scene was cringier - where they have sex or where Michael has a meltdown while public speaking? (I felt so much cringe at this point i jammed my fingers in my ears to avoid listening). My personal highlight was during the dream sequence when his face fell off. I was hoping he would spend more time with half a face thus sparing us his whiny droning voice. The concept is interesting ie having one male voice for all characters,but early on this left me confused. I thought he was gay when he was reading the first love letter and thought excitedly he might be having a marriage crisis, sadly not. if you haven't seen it yet watch the first ten minutes and only continue if you can bear that whiny Michael stone voice. If it doesn't make you long for a car accident please proceed. If yes,run now and don't look back."
26,Anomalisa,6,30 August 2016,"If you can make it through the first half, there's some interesting stuff","I love the writer Charlie Kaufman, but I'm not as enamored of the director Charlie Kaufman, who indulges his worst tendencies in a way others won't.Anomalisa starts very slowly, as middle-aged Michael comes into Cincinnati to give a lecture. The movie has a great love for the mundane, so we get a taxi driver giving advice, we get Michael's checking in and ordering dinner, we get an uncomfortable dinner with an ex.The only notable thing in the early part of this animated drama is that everyone Michael meets is voiced by one actor, both men and women. Only Michael has a unique voice. Then he meets a young, insecure woman who also has a unique voice (wonderfully done by Jennifer Jason Leigh), and this leads to bland conversation and a rather long sex scene.After all that, I was bored and restless, but then the movie picks up, offering a fascinating scene in the hotel basement after which the movie is weird, funny, sad, and brutally honest.In both Anomalisa and Synecdoche, Kaufman proves he's comfortable with boring people before getting around to giving Kaufman's fans what they have come to expect from him through movies like BJM and Adaptation. This movie is a slight step up from Synecdoche, but it's still disappointing, although perhaps worth watching anyway."
27,Anomalisa,1,3 January 2016,Don't believe the hype,"Well let's just start,yes he's done some great films but sadly this isn't one of them. Over hyped by the kings new clothes brigade this film is slow gets nowhere and is fine if you like watching Thunderbird's copulating .It just does not come together for the dramatic ending it promised, and the film is as soulless as the puppets eyes.Yes his life must be terrible great job and a loving family and wife who he decides to cheat on, do yourself a favor and don't waste an hour and a half of your life. If this was real people in the film instead of plasticine puppets, I guarantee we would have switched off after ten minutes. M Evans."
28,Anomalisa,7,14 July 2016,An interesting effort,"I watched this movie in two sittings. My wife couldn't handle it after 30 minutes: too boring; not enough feedback; confusing. So I watched the last half of the movie the next day. The animation allows one voice for everyone other than the main character and his most recent love interest. The faces are also the same for everyone else, and it is a reflection of the boredom that Michael Stone must be feeling about every interaction that he has. There is also the subtle transition as he becomes bored with Lisa, and then leaves her, just like he has left others before. I liked that his son did not have a generic face- it shows that there is still some semblance of life and interest behind his mask. Otherwise the mundaneness of his existence is palpable in his interactions with everyone.The problem is the boredom Michael experiences is also felt by the viewer. The movie is too successful in creating a sense of interpersonal apathy, and almost a sense of despondency. Hard to catch a viewer in an entertaining past time when you are trying (succeeding) to be as boring as possible.The movie succeeds in what it is attempting to do, but it takes a great deal of effort and staying power to get through the subtle transitions presented without having the interest bored out of you. Go watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind instead."
29,Anomalisa,8,14 June 2016,All the world's a set,"Michael Stone is a familiar character, an upper class man living a monotonous life on the cusp of a mid-life crisis. He craves substance and variety, but sees the world superficially as a chore that should have been completed long ago. How this premise differs from dozens of others is marvelous realism in interestingly unrealistic animation. I had to ask myself at the end of Anomalisa, ""What did animation accomplish for this movie?"" From a technical standpoint, nothing occurred on screen that couldn't have been more easily accomplished from live action. The true purpose of the stop- motion animation with these marionette-like characters is to engross us in Michael's mental state. He sees a world of puppets and seems to realize all the world's a stage, or more appropriately, a set.David Thewlis voices Michael with a dry British brogue that makes him both distinctive and superior to everyone else. In fact ""Everyone Else"" is a character in this film. Tom Noonan voices every man, woman, and child that Michael encounters. Noonan's voice has the great effect of being placidly common. This allows him to make small variations to give each character its own personality without ruining the effect of insufferable monotony. Two characters voiced by the same person can have viscous confrontations and it's still unmistakable that there are two characters. This is accomplished while making it glaringly clear that it's completely inconsequential who these characters are.Michael is a writer that preaches business models. What he laments about life is what he perpetuates, getting everyone on the same page. His job is going city to city, reading excerpts of his book to adoring entrepreneurs who have seen outstanding productivity growth based on his model. In one speech we hear him give details of his strategies in which he mentions recognizing clients as ""individuals"" and celebrating their diversity. These words are as hollow as the puppets he's speaking to.In most romances, there is a moment when the protagonist notices their counterpart. A ""meet-cute"" tugs at our heart strings and we follow them to a predictable end. The setting of Anomalisa allows for a profound moment for our protagonist to find his mate, a voice! Jennifer Jason Lee voices Lisa, a simple woman with low self-esteem and no exceptional virtues to speak of. She has to be special simply because she is not Tom Noonan. We have faith that there is something about Lisa souly on this basis, and Michael's blind infatuation with her. In all of our lives we have seen a friend find their ""one."" We may see red flags but nothing can convince them that this isn't ""the real thing."" This isn't denial, just a hopeless optimism that is all encompassing. How Michael falls for Lisa is a perfect representation of how short sighted we all are in the initial stages of love. Some learn the hard way how fleeting certainty can be.Charlie Kaufman movies can be a chore. They are always remarkable, often ingenious, but require multiple viewings to peel the labyrinthian onion. Anomalisa is no chore. The story is brief and the deep metaphors that we have come to expect are tied to the style. Duke Johnson is the co-director and animator on this project. His previous credits are low-budget shorts like ""Moral-Oral"" and ""Mary Shelley's Frankenhole."" With claymation and stop-motion animation, talent can't be taken for granted. An obscene amount of dedication and patience has to be employed to see a finished product. With an $8,000,000 budget, a masterpiece was created from a talented animator and one of the generation's greatest writers. I don't envy how they see the world, but it is a privilege to be shown."
30,Anomalisa,5,2 January 2016,Depressing and Overrated,"If I could go back in time, I would prevent myself from watching this movie. Judging from the praise the movie received, I thought the movie would start out depressing, but then have a life-affirming, positive theme at the end. I was dead wrong; the movie starts out depressing and then only continually spirals downward. The merit in the movie comes in with the impressive stop-motion animation.The plot of the movie is sparse and dull. The dialogue might be rationalized with ""it's banal on purpose"", but ultimately it's not entertaining, and leaves one with the feeling that the screenwriter was just too lazy to write nuanced dialogue.When the turning point in the movie comes, where the main character gets ""inspired"" by the new element in his life, it's downright cringe-worthy. The way it all ends is anti- climactic and almost predictable, except you'd expect there'd be some twist, something more, anything. The movie has an unfinished feel, like someone wrote the screenplay and did not bother reviewing it, or getting a second opinion."
31,Anomalisa,1,1 January 2016,A waste of amazing animation.,"This movie was garbage. The plot might be sad or in some way touching if it wasn't so brutally boring. I think that the animation was amazing and I know how much detail and dedication goes into stop motion so the animator should be congratulated. As for the film itself: weak dialogue, virtually no plot, and It's basically the film equivalent of what it's primarily made of--clay.Basically, if you're the type of person that likes to sit for an unfulfilled hour and a half of constantly wondering about when the supposed ""masterpiece"" that you're watching is going to suddenly get good, this film is for you. If you're the type of person who likes to watch pretentious garbage art films and then discuss their accolades with your pretentious garbage art film watching friends, then this film is for you. For anyone else, save yourself the trouble."
32,Anomalisa,3,22 July 2016,Heart sinks for ninety minutes,"Firstly, the animation is excellent and conveys the ideas of the film very well. However, the problem with a film conveying a life that is empty, tedious and annoying is that the film can become empty, tedious and annoying, which is the case here. Another problem is that we are meant to sympathise with the main protagonist, who is unrelentingly dull, self- absorbed and dismissive of everyone else. Personally I felt like kicking him not sympathising with him. This could have been mitigated by humour. There was a good joke in the the first two minutes. Unfortunately that was the only joke.In truth I'm surprised at all the positive reviews. If I got the chance to live my life again one of the things I would make a point of doing the second time around would be to not see this film."
33,Anomalisa,1,30 December 2015,Another Introspection Into Kaufmanns Depressive Mind,"After Synecdouche New York, his last super depressing movie, Charlie Kaufmann surprises us with an even more dull and depressive movie experience. This movie portrays primarily Mr.Kaufmann himself, a man with an empty depressing life, having sex with random people just to suppress feelings of meaninglessness, if you have watched Synecdouche New York you basically know the whole story ahead, because its almost the same, just a more linear story and a bit more boring. Again Kaufmann manages to show to us, the most miserable side of life, he is basically the opposite of a Federico Fellini, who would always put a glimpse of hope and love in his movies, even though the story might have been sad or demoralizing. The movie focuses only on the bad aspects of life and does not even manage to explore them fully , just scratching the surface of this complex subject, it is essentially putting the spotlight on all the Yin and cutting out the Yang, but like i stated earlier, its not even doing a good job at that. Don't watch this if you are already depressed, because you will feel even more empty after watching this."
34,Anomalisa,10,11 November 2015,'Anomalisa' is the classic Kaufman we all Love!,"There comes a moment in ""Anomalisa,"" from co-directors Charlie Kaufman  and Duke Johnson, where you stop fighting the need to try to understand  the weird yet invigorating story structure, and surrender to all the  quirks, charm, and emotional tension its displaying on screen.  Hypnotizing in the words ad expressions of its stop-motion characters,  Kaufman's screenplay is right up there with his top-tier works of  ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Being John Malkovich."" If  anything, it's as if Kaufman merged his brilliant writing style with  the works of Wes Anderson and Spike Jonze, delivering a newly  interpreted work that shows itself as one of the year's gargantuan  masterpieces in writing.  The less you know, the better. Watching the recent trailer that dropped  for the film did it no favors as it presented itself as the animated  version of ""Lost in Translation"" when its anything but. Simply put, it  focuses on a man named Michael Stone, who has made a career about  stressing the importance of customer service. When he takes a one day  trip to Cincinnati, he begins to focus on the mundanity of his life.  I've banged this drum too often, with some help from notable critics  and viewers, but voice work has to be looked upon as a genuine  performance, and you'll find just another example of it with the  outstanding works of David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tom  Noonan. Thewlis' Michael Stone is intricate and calculated with a real  sense of disparity and hopelessness. He envelops the essence of a lost  man, attempting to regain normality in a world where everything is far  too familiar and similar. Jennifer Jason Leigh captures the essence of  innocence and perplexity, as her Lisa tries to make sense of a  situation that can either be interpreted as fate or coincidence.  Visibly broken, and aching to be put back together, Leigh enriches the  morose yet intriguing nature of the film with zeal. It's one of her  best performances and one you can look back upon as another staggering  performance from a voice-actor. Tom Noonan where's so many hats in  ""Anomalisa,"" a chameleon transcending the inner workings of a broken  man. It's a breathtaking performance, one not obvious at first, but  eventually opens up in the most awkward but satisfying manner.  When walking into Kaufman and Johnson's world, one of the first  questions you have to ask is why stop motion? Does this have the  opportunity to be interpreted in different mediums that could be more  satisfying and accessible for the viewer? It's a perfect marriage of  narrative structure and story. As an adult animation drama, you can see  the freakish elements of films like ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" but it is in no  way for children. This speaks to the minds of adults. If you have ever  struggled with depression, or have been stuck in the abnormality of a  current state of living, the film may hit some very real chords with  you.  ""Anomalisa"" is an astounding achievement on every level. Exquisite and  ravishing animation is on full display, using divine, subtle tones of  color to capture the mood of a world all too distant but so  uncomfortably close. It's single-handedly one of the best films that  2015 has to offer. Don't deny yourself this experience."
35,Anomalisa,8,30 March 2016,The attention to detail is amazing,"This is certainly one of the strangest animations I have ever seen and strange in a very good way. This is a Stop-Motion film about a man , Michael Stone , who while on a business trip , decides that his life is so dull and mundane that he needs to have a bit of fun whether it be with an ex girlfriend or an admirer of his work. The problem is Michael Stone doesn't do fun. He doesn't really know how to. In fact he's not a very nice man at all.I loved this. The attention to detail is amazing. Not just the fascinating animation but the voices. Not until it starts to looks like he might have enjoyment do we hear a woman's voice. All other times it is voiced by the same man. That's the voices of women and children too and it highlights perfectly the rut he is stuck in. The sex scenes are very unnerving yet worryingly realistic . The film makers have got the facial expressions and even the tone of the voices perfectly and it's the little things that make this film so fascinating.Recommended."
36,Anomalisa,3,17 January 2016,"""A Masterpiece?""  oh, please!  How the hell is this a ""masterpiece?""","""Masterpiece?"" ""Most human film of the year???"" give me a break!! Its unclear which publication called this a ""A Masterpiece."" I wish I knew so I could mock them tooIf you want a masterpiece see ""Life is Beautiful"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Amadeus."" Those are masterpieces, this is garbage. I'd say that ""look who's talking"" is a ""masterpiece"" in comparison to this movie!There is no place on earth that this would be considered anywhere in the same league. This is not a ""masterpiece"" by any measure of the word. Over-rated nonsense about a wealthy, famous, but miserable burn-out trying to f--k his way out of his bored life, indifferent about the carnage he leaves in his wake. The story is nothing new; its a theme that has been written/filmed about many other times. The same voice thing took me a wile to figure our and was interesting but it was also confusing. Friggin rich white people.stop-motion freeze-frame animation was cool though, so 3 stars and that's it"
37,Anomalisa,1,3 January 2016,predatory sex praised as a love story?,"I find it awful that predatory sex depicted in this movie is being praised as a ""very human story with its tender love scene"" (Terry Gross). The fact of the matter is we see a predator who uses his small time fame to prey on the vulnerable: why is he choosing Lisa over her more attractive friend? Because of her vulnerability and her more innocent adulation. I do not know how emotional rape can be seen as a love story, which ""feminist"" lens do reviewers/critics look through. When an autistic person has sex without giving a consent, is that considered a rape or a tender story. Even if such person enjoys sex, the act is still not consented to. Here we have a 'consensual' affair, a person is consenting because she is being exploited emotionally. Watching this movie, made me continuously cringe. If it were simply porn, it would had been turned off, but with the high critics behind it, i watched, very much disgusted by the triviality and violence of this movie. And how would one value this movie: as porn, bad quality porn. Charlie Kaufman's all movies are more or less a disappointment. They toy with some technical ideas, but really have very little humanist value behind them."
38,Anomalisa,4,24 November 2016,Girls might wanna have fun but there's not much to be had here.,"What better way to make a movie about the 'sameness' of everything than to do it as stop-motion animation, (a computer game in which 'reality' has been completely banished), where everyone other than the two main characters look exactly the same and, more significantly, speaks with the same voice, (Tom Noonan's), be they male or female. In other words we could be watching a movie about cyborgs rather than people.We are in an hotel in contemporary Cinncinatti but we could be in Alphaville. The only characters who aren't voiced by Noonan are Michael, (David Thewlis), a motivational speaker staying at the upmarket Frejole Hotel for one night and Lisa, the young woman he spends the night with. She is very well voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh though, of course, these characters may as well be cyborgs too, (at one point even Michael's face begins to come apart like a robot out of ""Westworld"").Of course, being a Charlie Kaufman film, (he co-directed it with Duke Johnson as well as writing it), the old ennui up on the screen is almost boringly predictable; no, on second thoughts it is boringly predictable. Technically it's something of a marvel but for a film about the banality of life and relationships it's predictably banal and it's not like you can read into it multiple meanings. Brilliantly animated it may be but ultimately this is a one-note picture. On the other hand, there is a nice melancholy version of ""Girls just wanna have fun"", not that they'll find much here."
39,Anomalisa,,20 December 2015,Mostly experimentation with little amusement.,"Though devoid of any real people, ""Anomalisa"" challenges the audience with a conspicuous, powerful humanity echoing in every scene and lingering on each line of dialogue. Conversations flow naturally. Perceptions reflect reality. And the interactions between characters are distinctly human, provoking unease, sympathy, and humor Â– sometimes all at once. Whether it's the laboriousness of crafting uncomfortable exchanges with strangers, the precarious dance of courtship, or the struggle with self worth, everyone can relate to an emotion experienced or witnessed by ""Anomalisa's"" protagonists. Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson's film will undoubtedly make its viewers think, though the highly existential vagaries, surreal uncertainties, and graphic sexual nature may cloud its more fascinating insights into human behavior.Caught in a seemingly inescapable cycle of monotony and perpetual flight from meaningful relationships, author and orator Michael Stone (David Thewlis) heads to Cincinnati to speak at a customer service conference. Desperate for companionship, he calls up Bella, an old girlfriend he hasn't seen in eleven years. After the expectedly awkward and dispiriting encounter, Michael happens upon Emily and Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh), two young women who are staying at the same hotel and plan to attend his speech. Inviting them out for drinks, Michael becomes attracted to shy, timid Lisa, and attempts to cultivate their connection.""Anomalisa"" doesn't give away its imagery right away; instead, through the sounds of conversations and small talk, audiences are gently let into the world of its unsettling animation. There's a certain level of realism to the eyes and props and environments of these Gerry Anderson-like creations, but it's the voices that truly bring these marionettes to life Â– particularly with the outrageous gimmick of having Tom Noonan voice every character other than Michael and Lisa. With this concept, the film's meditative insight into mundanity allows little observations on humdrum routines to reveal the components of Michael's escalating dissatisfactions. From a taxi ride to checking in at a hotel to ordering room service, Michael is clearly caught in a series of excruciatingly ordinary events Â– ones that heavily weigh on his psyche.It isn't until the explicit, real-time foreplay, cunnilingus, and intercourse sequences that ""Anomalisa"" unveils the failures of its ultimate experiment. Specifically human activities possess an eeriness that is difficult to shake, even though the voicework by Thewlis and Leigh is utterly mesmerizing. Such authentic notes of tenderness and sexuality permeate their discourse, even though it's filtered through the restricted movements of plastic puppet faces. It's also quite odd that ""Anomalisa"" is animated in the first place; it lacks all of the signature elements inherent to the art form, including out-of-this-world happenings and pure fantasy. As an artistic analysis of midlife crises or a delirious descent into unbearable mental discontent, the mix of peculiar character designs and utter ordinariness is completely effective. Plus, the humor is sensational. But as a slice-of-life drama (and just the tiniest sliver at that), the film is mostly experimentation with little amusement, interested not in conveying a story so much as commenting on a psychogenic affliction.The Massie Twins"
40,Anomalisa,10,22 October 2015,Kaufman Delivers on his First Stop-Motion Project,"First Viewing:Well, Kids, it has finally happened. Watching Charlie Kaufman's ANOMALISA was like being at Disney World for the first time. THE HOUR AND THIRTY-MINUTES went by so fast for me from how much fun I was having. AND HE DELIVERED! as usual. If you are one who is thinking that 'maybe after being out of the spotlight for six years', that maybe Kaufman had lost his touch, NO. not in the slightest.This alluring and poetic stop-motion picture takes place in one of the most undervalued cities of the world; Cincinnati. Which is famous for its ""zoo's"" and ""chili"" supposedly. Michael Stone, played by the very gifted David Thewlis, is an award-winning author for a business-ethics book that is highly praised by all. Literally.. you will HEAR background voices whispering about. saying, ""look, it's Michael Stone."" Unfortunately, he is not too proud to be who he is. Masks. (beat) We all wear them. But how far do we go to hide who we truly are in the norm of the world? Â— *A WORLD WHERE EVERYONES VOICES SOUND THE SAME.* Â— Michael feels as if he is living a lie. He is trapped! But it doesn't stop there. In my opinion, he is not one who gives-up easily. **ONE NIGHT, as he checks into an average hotel suite, he begins drinking; thinking about an old lover, Belle, INSTEAD of his wife and (firefighting) son at home. Things begin to shift gears when a quasi-surreal occurrence happens after a nice warm shower in the hotel room. You see, the faces for these puppets that Kaufman and Johnson use have a very unique look that most ""clay-nation-ers"" choose to omit out. That is, the lines on the face where the animators can change their facial expressions; usually, these lines are covered up.**One element that I want to first go into was THE SOUND. Now, I am no expert with sound department, but viewing this in the theater with the rumbles and echoes, it was like a dream. This was a PERFECT FILM. I do not deny saying it. Part of my critique was based off my love for screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, but I am beyond that. If this was a bad film, I would say so, but for this brilliant storyteller, it is simply impassible. His poetically charged dialogue saves all and It is the main reason why I love the piece of shite. If it weren't for these passionate, lost characters trying to find themselves, I would not know where I am right now. Thank you Mr. Charlie Kaufman"
41,Anomalisa,2,8 March 2016,not me,"I have to agree with other viewers who said 'the preview did not prepare me for this dark movie'. I should have 'walked out midway'. At the end, I felt like someone let air out of my tires - a very flat movie. Portrait of an ordinary being, living an ordinary life on mundane level. What was the point of adding sex scene? Embarrassing, to say the least! Perhaps the movie is too realistic.(hence the use of puppets) Most of us go to be entertained &/or transcend the humdrum of daily life. I kept looking for a metaphysical message? Have we become robots? Do we lack a spiritual component? Do we have to take pills in order to cope with anxiety, depression, and other unpleasant feelings?"
42,Anomalisa,3,1 February 2016,Should have left it as a Short,"I get it that critics are raving; that it's up for an Oscar. As stop-motion animation, it deserves an award. But IMO it stops there.The 'Trivia' here on IMDb says it originally was supposed to be a 40min. Short Film. They should have stuck with that. A review I've seen is that it is ""haunting""...the only things that haunts me about this movie is that I paid $23 to see it.I think it was too long. 40 minutes would have done it justice.As a somewhat unimportant side note, the song which Noonan ""sings"" during the credits had me running out of the theater and I typically like to stay for the credits.Overall the movie annoyed me. Discussing the movie with my companion, annoyed me. To each his own I suppose."
43,Anomalisa,6,3 January 2016,"Incredible Stop-Motion work, but a very overrated film","Whether a film is overrated or not is very, very subjective. 'Overrated' is a very strong word and should not be thrown around lightly when trying to describe a film as it will tend to lose its meaning. That being said, this movie is by far the definition of an overrated film, to me. 'Anomalisa' is a Stop-Motion Drama that highlights a day in the troubled life of Michael Stone where something out of the ordinary happens and he explores a relationship with a woman named Lisa. This is an incredibly small film and not many people would have heard of it. But once i did hear of it, seeing all of the incredible reviews it was getting and the 5/5's on the poster made me very intrigued as to what all the fuss was about. And as it turns out, i didn't think this movie was anything more than average, and far from the 'Masterpiece' it is being labeled as. A masterpiece of stop-motion technology? Definitely. But a Masterpiece film it is not. What this film did incredibly well was it managed to capture human emotions, movements and performances so perfectly that you completely forget you are watching an animation. The way Director Charlie Kaufman brings these figures to life is amazing to see, and the performances he gets out of them are better than what you get from real people. This also brought life to the characters of Michael and Lisa and really allowed you to see them as real people with real distinct personalities. Michael is one of the more realistic and grounded human characters of 2015, he is clearly conflicted and has many flaws but none of them are hidden in favour of the story. I cannot stress enough how much he seems like a real person, that aspect of the film, the character creation, development, and exploration is like nothing i have ever seen in a stop-motion film, so i will give credit where credit is due. But other than that the film didn't have anything to offer.The storytelling was rather dull, depressing and only had a few moments where it was kinda engaging. When i say 'story' i am really talking about Michael's journey to Cincinnati and the relationship between Michael and Lisa that ensues. It is rather light on story as it is focusing on the characters more, but with the overall tone and the events that occur it does get to some fairly dark and depressing levels that were hard to get into. It takes some kinda interesting turns occasionally and most definitely was not predictable but for the rest of the film i was left wanting more than just impressive Stop-Motion. The film begins and you start asking questions, then it keeps going and you start asking more and more questions whilst only receiving a few ambiguous answers. The reason why i feel this film is going to generate a lot of differing opinions is that it does require quite a bit of thinking on behalf of the viewer to come to a conclusion to what it all means. This is very evident from the directors choice to have David Thewlis voice Michael, Jennifer Jason Leigh voice Lisa, and Tom Noonan voice literally ""everyone else"". It is definitely an artistic choice and not one based on laziness or budget issues, but it will raise a lot of questions with some people, and just bore others.So in the end this was an overall disappointing and very overrated film that still had what may be the best use of stop-motion animation i have ever seen. It takes someone with a love for the artistic side of films to really get anything at all out of it, as to any casual movie-goer it will probably come across as a boring mess which is completely understandable. Watch it if you want, form your own opinion, i just hope it doesn't make an impact at the Oscars. - 5.8/10"
44,Anomalisa,1,7 June 2016,It Hits the Moral Gutter,"This movie is animated pornography. I think the high rating was strictly for the creativity and nothing else. The ending was depressing and had no redeeming quality. Pure trash. If you love watching adultery and marital unfaithfulness as if it is normal behavior, then you'd like this movie. If you like seeing the moral gutter, you'll think this movie is watchable. I only wish the advertisements had warned me of it, I would have stayed away. I was waiting for the story line to get better, but instead it got worse until the ending was the worst of all, and left me depressed and wishing I had never seen it. Psychological vomit."
45,Anomalisa,4,8 January 2016,Bizarre in both good ways and bad,"Don't know what to make of this. The stop-motion was breathtaking, the characters extremely lifelike. David Thewlis is terrific and perfectly cast, Jennifer Jason Leigh is also extremely touching, and Tom Noonan does an incredible job at voicing all the film's other characters. Its amazing how so many different characters could be so convincing.However, my biggest problem is the story. Not a whole lot happens, despite its ingenious premise. The stop-motion kept my attention for a very long time, but the film seems to just be watching Michael go about his miserable life. A tremendous deal of effort has been put into making the puppet sex scenes meaningful rather than comic and it absolutely pays off, but it seems to have come at the expense of the story. I found Michael's bizarre choices (regarding a present for his son) removed from his crippling mundanity and therefore not effective. Especially the film's final scenes, after he wakes up, are just things that happen and don't make a lot of sense. It also dragged a lot for a ninety minute film.I wouldn't watch Anomalisa again. It managed to get a ""ohhhh"" out of me when I realised the film's title's meaning, but that's the only emotion it got besides boredom and a little laugh at Tom Noonan's four person rendition of Sous le Dome Epais. I will just say that it's nice to see an animated movie that doesn't have to be a sickly sweet kids movie."
46,Anomalisa,4,30 January 2016,Anomalisa is not my favorite Charlie Kaufman movie.,"This isn't the first time I've found some of Charlie Kaufman's brilliant writing a dull affair. I came into Anomalisa with the promise of a human story told with animation. I found this movie to be pretty slow and boring. Not much happens like life, but also the story hardly goes anywhere that I found worth exploring or thinking about later.I'd heard this movie started out as a radio play and I ran with the fact that most of the voices are done by the same actor, male and female characters all share the voice of Tom Noonan. This was a bit odd but I was willing to look past it and follow the plight of Michael Stone voiced by David Thewlis. He's miserable and lonely as he lands in Cincinnati to deliver a speech on customer service.The main plot surrounds a romantic encounter between Michael and a scarred woman named Lisa voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh. There are some interesting scenes and the roman seems cute but I found it quite slow and grueling to sit through. Overall, there isn't much to say about this movie and it's short. The animation was spectacular and used in creative ways. I like Kaufman's work but this isn't one of my favorites.Check out this review and others at swilliky.com"
47,Anomalisa,1,31 December 2015,are you kiddin'?,"Saw the Reviews and thought this might be something special. After a while, when nothing was happening, mentally or otherwise, I thought that they would use the animation to show things in a ""regular"" Movie That would otherwise only turn up in a porno, thereby not having the difficulty of letting a ""serious"" actor/actress totally loose it in front of the camera as porno stars Always do, which is the reason why these two categories of Movies, serious and porno, never mix. Well, not even that happened.In summary: No imagination, no surprises, no nothing really. So, now Reading the other comments, all I have to say is: Are you kidding?"
48,Anomalisa,5,10 April 2016,I was fooled by all the praise on the poster,"I thought a movie with so many good things on the poster had to be good, right? I was wrong. That marketing trick fooled me. I hoped that the negative reviews here were wrong and they just didn't appreciate it. I was wrong again. This film is very slow, with a lot of filler that makes you wonder why they put it in, other than to stretch it out to 90 minutes. The story is unsatisfying, and seems pointless. It's also strange that one person voices most of the characters (even the female ones) except one.Basically, listen to the reviews that say don't bother. I skipped through the last 20 minutes on FFWD just to see how it ended, because I couldn't take wasting any more time on it. I'm glad I didn't watch it through to the unsatisfying ending.If you like slow/boring/pointless (seemingly) movies - and I have a friend who does - then this is probably for you. Otherwise, if you like your movies to have a point or be entertaining, stay away."
49,Anomalisa,4,30 December 2016,Novelty of production camouflages emptiness of plot,"A middle-aged man, Michael Stone, is in Cincinnati to give a presentation at a conference. He is a customer service guru and has written a big-selling book on the subject. While in town he looks up an old flame he left 10 years previously. Though he is married with a child, he seems very discontented, depressed and empty, and is looking for some way to fill the void. Then he meets Lisa.Despite the novel animation, quite dull. The plot had potential, exploring the meaning of life, especially when you're middle-aged, but it doesn't explore the subject very well, doing it rather superficially. Between wallowing in a sea of melancholy, the only solution being presented seems to be ""Hey, are you bored with life? Have an affair with someone 20-30 years younger than you"".Another part of the problem with the movie is that there is very little engagement with the central character. Michael Stone is not very likable, being a dull, adulterous lech, who's possibly a tad crazy too.The animation was well done, though I don't know why it was necessary at all. I would have much preferred a non-animated version. Cynically, I think the only reason it was animated is that it is easier to get a Best Animated Picture Oscar nomination than a Best Picture nomination...The use of the same voice artist for all but two of the characters was irritating too, especially when it is clearly a male voice and some of the characters were female. There was a point to it all, and this also provides a case for using animation, but it was incredibly irritating, and a bit confusing at times too.I had high hopes for this movie, hoping to see Charlie Kaufman return to the form of Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Alas, he has not."
50,Anomalisa,9,23 August 2016,Great character study movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Anomalisa"" (2015) is a very intimate, sometimes confusing but always interesting to watch character study movie - and it's surely not for everyone. Directed and written by the brilliant Charlie Kaufman (""Being John Malkovich""; ""Adaptation."" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") it is almost on the same league as the three great movies i'm just mentioned. When i was watching ""Anomalisa"" not for a second i thought i was watching an animated movie - it was so real and plausible that it would work out as an motion picture. This is not an animated movies for children, don't even bother with that. This is a great examination of life itself trough the eyes of a man, who at that moment of his life doesn't even see a difference in people anymore, they all looks and sound the same trough his eyes (and our as well), until... Anomalisa happens.Overall, ""Anomalisa"" isn't for everyone, but i loved this movie simply to ... watch after my hard day of work. It shows so many things right, so many things we've seen in our lives. It isn't a mainstream entertainment, it is a great character (which we all see in our self's at least partly) study movie."
51,Anomalisa,,10 July 2016,"Inventive use of stop-motion animation, the actual story is somewhat 'blah'.","I saw this at home on DVD, my wife was out of town and didn't see it. I don't think it is her kind of movie anyway.I had heard much of the praise for this movie but purposely didn't try to learn too much going into viewing it. Animated using stop-motion puppets, Brit David Thewlis voices the main character, Michael Stone, a well-known customer service proponent and author. He has flown into Cincinnati to give a presentation to a large group of customer service professional from various points. (As an aside, the cab driver from the airport was telling Michael about things to see in Cincinnati, and as he does I wondered if he would mention that peculiar culinary delight, 'Cincinnati Chili', and shortly he does. I smiled.)So anyway Michael has a fairly mundane, boring existence, you can tell checking into a hotel and ordering room service is something he does all the time. But he seems depressed, everyone he encounters has the same face, and they all sound the same. Even the women. That was disconcerting at the beginning when it showed an old girlfriend who spoke with a man's voice, I assumed it was a long-haired man and being a former lover that Michael was a homosexual. But he called home to L.A. and his wife and son sounded the same.After seeing the whole movie I understood why it is done this way but it added an initial layer of confusion that, to me, takes away from the core story.Michael has a chance encounter with someone who doesn't have the same face as everyone else, and who sounds like a women. It is Lisa and she is an anomaly, thus she gets the name 'Anomalisa', the title of this movie. She is voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh. In what seems like a very quick decision for both of them he invites her to his room, he has but one objective, and it was a bit strange seeing two puppets in a sexual encounter. Michael is a very flawed person, I'm not so sure delving into his flaws is a way to make an interesting movie. I give it good marks for the inventive animation but low marks for the story.All the other voices are provided by Tom Noonan."
52,Anomalisa,7,14 June 2016,Through the eyes of one who thinks everyone in the world is alike.,"The film was based on the stage play. Originally it was meant for a short movie, but during in the production it was extended to a feature film length and ended up knocking the Oscars door. A R-rated stop-motion animation, which is the first in the history of the Academy Awards to get a nomination. My last stop-motion was the last year's 'Shaun the Sheep Movie', so that makes this kind of filmmaking is going extinct. For that reason alone, I just don't want to miss it out, as well as I prepared to enjoy every bit of it and so I suggest others to do the same if they find it interesting.My expectation was quite simple which is entertainment. But usually animations are comedies, in that perspective, this is slightly a letdown. Wait, this film is for adults and of course the humours in this narration was delivered on its own style like a black comedy. It is a weird title right! But the film explains it in a simple manner. That's not it, there are more weird stuffs in it, like I was confused over the character voice tones for both the sexes and again the film had the reasons which will be revealed at a crucial segment.It was something like 'Lost in Translation', about a middle-aged man named Michael Stone, who is on a trip to Cincinnati to promote his latest book. Slowly it unfolds what kind of person he's really and going further, his struggle in the married life comes the prime focus. So this tour opens a new door for him once again to fall in love which leads him for a tough decision to make. But at a certain extent, the reality check comes into play. About everything he's doing and all the life he left behind makes him feel he's trapped in some kind of delusion. His ultimate decision is where this tale going to conclude.""Sometimes there's no lesson. That's a lesson in itself.""The camera never takes off its lens in its throughout narration on the main character, Stone. Right from the beginning till the final scene, the film follows him like in a real time. So the entire film was like everything that happened in a 24 hour. That's the character development you would get. Besides, there are scenes, like the sex part that may stun you. Because it was not like I have ever seen one, not in animation. Even compared it to the Hentai, Hentai was 2 dimensional pictures whereas this is technically a 3 dimensional, so the effect was much more realistic and the impact on the viewers definitely will be strong.The real problem those who saw it to end up in a disappointment is that it's not your regular animation. Which is usually aimed for children and family audience, but adults too can have a great time, whereas this film had a very matured and sensitive contents. Maybe they did not want the display of the real life experience to be narrated with a bunch of toys. But in the perspective of stop-motion animation, it is a great artistic achievement. It is not only their anticipation that killed their joy, but failing to accept the fact that we see regularly in the live-shot films to see them again in a different format.What I liked the most in it was the message regarding the main character on his suffering. When he sits in front of the antique he bought for his son which makes him realise himself on what he's seeking in others around him. But what's his delusion is that he thinks the world is not balanced, everyone are alike. So what he actually needs is a redefined life, in which this film portrayed how close he came to one before everything shattered.This is not just a comedy, but a very real film for the people who wants to understand the life on its different stages and threat it poses where every one of us go through in our lifetime. Surely it is no masterpiece, but there's no reason to ignore on the subject it deals. It will remain one of the best stop-motion animation, exclusively made for adults. There are grown up who simply ignore animations, because they think it is too cartoonish. Undoubtedly it will be a good film them to try.7/10"
53,Anomalisa,9,8 June 2016,Charlie Kaufman Does it Again,"Anomalisa follows Michael Stone, an elderly man who is dissatisfied with his life. He flies out for a business trip one day and meets Lisa Hesselman, the only woman who really seems to stand out to him. From the movies I've seen by Charlie Kaufman I know that he's either weird and hilarious or absolutely brilliant. This is another of his brilliant movies. The plot may be kind of unoriginal, but all that really matters is the presentation. And right off the bat this movie basically said, ""Hey, I'm incredibly well-written"" and just rubbed it in my face. The dialogue is fantastically realistic, not one word felt out of place. Because of this every character is relatable and realistic, even if I'm not a dissatisfied old man or a young woman lacking self confidence. Despite this movie being only 90 minutes long, it manages to show Micheal Stone's life almost moment for moment. The movie takes it's time with every event, and thus no event feels like it could have used more focus, nor could it use any less. I guess that means it was just paced really well, or it puts you, the audience, into the life of Michael Stone really well. One of my favorite things in this movie was the symbolism. It's kind of subtle, and doesn't take away from the story, but it's still evident in the story and makes you think. I've actually found multiple interpretations of what this movie is about, which I think is just a further sign of how brilliant this movie is. Overall Anomalisa is fantastic. Flawless? Maybe. I can see anyone saying that, including myself. At the moment though, I'd need to see it again. Everything about this movie is fantastic though, and in the end I would highly recommend it. As the critics say, this is easily the most human movie of the year, and possibly that I've ever seen. Funny thing is, there wasn't a single actual human in the movie."
54,Anomalisa,8,27 May 2016,"my only wish, Lisa turns out to be fine afterward","An R-rated stop-motion animation feature from the genius mind screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, his second foray in the director's chair (shared with Duke Johnson this time), 7 years after his metaphysical debut SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK (2008).Framed the story in the mundanity of a middle-aged family man Michael Stone's (Thewlis) business trip to Cincinnati, Ohio, from the very start, the film leaves a big question mark hovering around, why painstakingly has it been made in this puppetry format instead of a live action, where everything can be more conveniently created in a real physical world? There must be a reason for that, but Kaufman refrains to give it away for at least â…” of the film's length, relents only once where a surreal scene pops out out of nowhere before finally reveals his real intention in a dream sequence.Michael is a Briton, specialises in customer service, but works and lives in L.A., with a seemingly perfect marriage, he is coming to Cincinnati as a keynote speaker, but from the first glance, he is jaded, slightly sulky, and disinterested to people around him, it turns out, he is having a middle-age crisis. The hotel he stays is named Fregoli, which serves as a not-so-subtle cue if one is familiar with Fregoli delusion, aka. the delusion of doubles, is exactly what Michael is subjected to. After the initial befuddlement - for example, why the voices of all the female characters sound like a man? and visually, apart from himself, everyone else, man or woman, seems to all be designed from the very same puppet prototype, by the time we meet Lisa (Leigh), a wallflower-type self- conscious attendee who stays in the same hotel, who is the only anomaly with a different voice and appearance, which immediately captivates Michael, that's when we will realise what is the problem of Michael, he has lost interest in everyone else in his life, that's why they are so monotonous (all voiced by Noonan, from Michael's wife, his old-flame to taxi driver and bellboy) and why it should be presented as a stop-motion animation, to make the mechanical repetition more overwhelming. Yet, except Lisa, whom he baptises as Anomalisa, after he invites her to his hotel room for a steamy night.To watch lifelike puppets mimic real sex is something gives you a bizarre feeling, but things get better, after a nightmare which subconsciously convinces Michael that Lisa is the one who he has been looking for, he decides to leave his wife and start anew with Lisa. While they are discussing it heatedly during their breakfast, Michael's subjective impression of Lisa changes, her foibles start to get on his nerves, just like that, Anomalisa suddenly is deprived of her anomaly, both visually and sonically.At that point, Kaufman has done something extraordinary and very smart, his scalpel aims to Michael, it is not that he is looking for someone special to fulfil his otherwise boring life, as the truth turns out he is the one who is incapable of love, each time he thinks he finds the special one, which is merely driven by his libido, once he backtracks to the not-so-sexy routine life, he just loses the interest, the pathogenic reason is the erroneous prejudice of objectification women only for sexual pleasure, which in fact, is the canker of human society ever since the birth of human race. Life shouldn't be stimulated by one's libido, we talk the talk, then walk the walk, it enthuses great pleasure to watch a film pinpointing the scourge and credits to Kaufman and his team for accomplish it with such economy, notably the final touch with semen on the Japanese doll, a real game-changer.Jennifer Jason Leigh, deserves a special shout-out, for her ""anomalous"" voice faulty which brings Lisa to life, who is both ordinary and not-ordinary, her quirkiness can either present her as a low- hanging object of desire or a vexing chatterbox, totally depends on the timing of her male companion, we only wish, Lisa turns out to be fine afterward."
55,Anomalisa,,1 January 2016,Anomalisa: A Mona Lisa,"Caught this film at a last minute matinÃ©e at ArcLight Hollywood. It's a stop motion animated film about a British author, voiced by David Thewlis, coming to Cincinnati for one night for a conference and his time spent in a first class hotel.At the beginning I was impatient with it, I thought it might be just a stop motion South Park episode, where all the voices are pretty much the same. Then when the character of Lisa came on the screen, it all changed for me. I got it, it clicked. The film is so disarmingly simple in its beauty and elegance. The relationship between the two main characters really touches you. Plus I'd never thought I'd be moved by the singing of a particular well known 1980s pop song in the film.The role of Lisa was a diamond in the rough character, a beautiful, flawed girl whose been wrongly ignored romantically and it just takes the right person to see how fantastic she really is. It made me think of the times I wished I'd had a Lisa in my life and the times I was fortunate enough to have one. Lisa was voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh in a performance that fooled me, I was so drawn into the character I had no idea it was her, I only saw Lisa as Lisa.While not a perfect film, it won me over and works on many levels, the filmmakers, Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson, leave it largely up for the viewer to decide what the film is about. Is the lead character insane? Is he in Limbo, his own private Hell, is everyone a robot, wearing masks literally? Does he see oil painting beauty in someone one day and the next sees only cracks and flaws? Who can say?One thing though, voice actor Tom Noonan, albeit talented, should never sing again, ever. Never again, Dollarhyde, never again. Anomalisa, or as I call it, A Mona Lisa, is the same as the iconic painting that is its namesake, kind of a thing of flawed beauty."
56,Anomalisa,1,29 May 2016,I can't understand how someone can like this movie,"I cannot emphasize enough how much I hated this film. It was such an interesting concept and the teasers made it look so good that I had to go and see the movie. I didn't see so stupid movie for a long time... S Absolutely awful. I don't know how this movie is so good rated in this page. This movie is a big mess, no story, no logic, nothing. Big waste of 2 hour of my life. I hate this kind of movies. I wonder what is going on in the mind of creators of this movie. A big, analogically constructed mess.this movie is so boring,the main advantage if you want to see this crap i deep sleeping if u wanted that go on.lazy movie. lazy plotting. lazy acting. lazy script. lazy thought"
57,Anomalisa,1,27 April 2016,Disappointing-waste of time,"Oh My God. As an economist and a rational human being, I always consider my opportunity costs in almost anything i do. I lost about 1,5 hours watching this, I implore you to not do so. I generally do not write a review for a movie, unless its very very good or horrible. This movie falls into the latter. Too much of swearing-for no reason, really. One point-could be turned into a mediocre 5 min play-not 2 hours-for God's sake. The voices were annoying The script very very poor Not funny-even though some I heard in the theater some people laughing. I found it terribly made, but maybe its just not my type. BTW, I did like the eternal sunshine of a spotless mind-same director."
58,Anomalisa,3,23 January 2016,"Animation mastery, but incomplete story","The stop motion animation of Anomalisa is impressive. It is frank and refreshing to see very human situations vividly portrayed with the figures. It is groundbreaking in its representation of humans with inanimate objects. However, that is all that is good about this movie. The characters are not admirable in any way. Michael is emotionally immature and is crippled in forming relationships. Lisa is almost pathetic in her resemblance to an emotional orphan or waif. Lisa's female friend is believable, but she gets left out of the most heartfelt portrayals of intimacy in the story, without any good reason other than, apparently, her being older than Lisa. The hotel manager in the dream is odd, and his oddity is unexplained. The characters were flawed as people, but only in a trite way. You have probably met people like them, and you may not want to see them again in this format. The movie purports to be about insights into the human condition, but it falls short. Watching one act of any Shakespeare play offers more insight than this whole movie. And that includes his lighter plays. In addition the story is left hanging here at the end of the movie. It is unfinished as a movie. It looks like something that came out of a college writing workshop, except that I'd expect those scripts to have some sense of closure. You'll not see closure here. If you like animation and technical skills, this is a fascinating movie. But, if you want a good plot, story, and characters, skip this and see something proved. You'll be saving your own time."
59,Anomalisa,1,31 December 2015,Don't understand the reviews here,"Absolutely awful, fell asleep about 25 minutes in. I don't know who Charlie Kaufman is, but after reading some reviews I was expecting something deeply profound that speaks to the need for human socialization. What I got was a clay figure porno with really bad dialogue. I want to get 90 minutes of my time back. **spoiler alert** To summarize the dialogue is: ""for F*** sake...F*** this...F***...F***...F***"" it sounds like it was written by a 12 year old. The reviews on IMDb are clearly written by people involved in the production. This should be nominated for worst movie of the year. This doesn't bode well for the future of ""crowd-sourced"" movie campaigns."
60,Anomalisa,7,18 January 2016,"Deep, Or At Least Seemingly So","A man crippled by the mundanity of his life (voiced by David Thewlis) experiences something out of the ordinary.Through most of 2015, ""Inside Out"" was seen as the clear winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar. Then, almost out of nowhere, this film started popping up as the possible usurper. After all, it comes from Charlie Kaufman, one of the great Hollywood screenwriters. And the stop-motion animation is among some of the best ever done. If anyone could knock Pixar off their pedestal, it was Kaufman.This film reveals itself slowly. It may take a while before you realize that all voices come from Tom Noonan. But it increasingly becomes painfully obvious... even the women have the same male voice. Even the lead character's wife and son. And for a while, this might be confusing. What would the point of doing this be? And then comes Lisa (the anomaly), which brings everything into clarity.With the relationship of Michael and Lisa, we have a strange dynamic. Michael is something of a celebrity and is said to be quite handsome (it is hard to judge). Lisa is, on the other hand, insecure and not overly assertive. In fact, almost completely lacking in any assertiveness. From Michael's point of view, she is the answer to his prayers: the one person different in all the world. But to outside observers (i.e. us), is he taking advantage of her, using her as only a thing and not a person? Which raises the bigger question, is Michael tragic or evil? He makes some bad moral decisions. Most notably trying to have an affair with one woman and then another. But is he evil? Or just weak in his own way? He is strongly hinted at suffering from some sort of delusion wherein the world is out to get him. Should we feel sorry for him? Again, we should expect complex characters from Charlie Kaufman. This is the man who brought us such thought-provoking films as ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999), ""Adaptation"" (2002), and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004). But this one does not live up to those others. It unfortunately seems to be too boring at times, and is far more depressing than even ""Eternal Sunshine"" was.As a technical achievement, it is the better film when compared with ""Inside Out"". The work involved was more intense, and the script is arguably better (though they are both great). But ""Inside Out"" will take the award... it is the more uplifting film, the more emotional film and the one that will hit home for more viewers. ""Anomalisa"" is worth seeing, but is not the best cartoon of 2015."
61,Anomalisa,5,7 March 2016,"If you're in the mood, you might like it.  I didn't.","You know, I actually get the point of most films, but somehow this one I missed, by a mile. It is, I suppose, a matter of taste. or perhaps it's simply that I'm out of patience with ""thoughtful"" films that really seem to have no point. Very good actors here, who lend their talents to this effort, and perhaps in the eyes of the producer their efforts succeed. I found it rather tedious, and wished after having watched it that I had not wasted my time. Hate being so negative, but this one I really didn't get. Jennifer Jason Leigh is a first rate actress, whose work I have enjoyed over a long stretch of years, and David has also done excellent work in his career, but I cannot help but feel another story would have allowed their talents to shine. Not recommended."
62,Anomalisa,6,5 June 2016,The Vidiot Reviews...,"AnomalisaStop-motion animation is arduous on voice-actors because they can only say their lines in very small increments.Fortunately, like with this stop-motion dramedy, it all comes together in post-production.While on a book tour to Cincinnati, unhappily married self-help author Michael (David Thewlis) meets an old flame for a drink in his hotel. When that doesn't pan out he flirts with an insecure groupie Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and takes her back to his room.Inspired by a fevered-dream, he suggests they run away together. But her annoying idiosyncrasies and his increasing anxiety towards society may end their elopement before it begins.A surreal, yet substantial, look at a mid-life crisis through the meticulous method of stop- motion animation, esoteric writer-director Charlie Kaufman brings his awkward insight and doleful humor to this Herculean effort with unprecedented and depressing results.But at least this Claymation mid-life crisis has a lower body count than the California Raisins'.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
63,Anomalisa,4,1 February 2016,You won't understand it as well as you claim to your friends,"Like Synecdote, you won't get this Charlie Kaufman foray into the great weirdness but you'll claim it spoke to you to your friends. Everyone is a puppet whose face is obviously easy swappable to make the stop motion animation economical. Why it made sense to make a movie that includes nearly 95% dialog and nearly no plot in stop- motion sits first along a very long list of questions the film prompts. Unfortunately, too many of those questions are about the author's intent and too few are questions raised by the writing. If you assume, probably wrongly, that this is a story about a man going through his midlife crisis by hearing everyone as the same voice (including his young son which is just cold by the way) and not really dealing with it at least the proceedings make a form of sense. Otherwise you'll just be lost as most viewers and will need to pretend that the film spoke to you in some difficult to explain way when your friends ask you about it so they don't think you lack erudition. Take the Marc Maron route and refer to it as ""an incredibly human film not starring any humans"". It doesn't mean anything but it'll sound deep. In short, stream ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" again instead."
64,Anomalisa,9,6 January 2016,A beautifully well crafted film.,"I was finally able to see 'Anomalisa' and boy this was a strange film. Not strange in a bad way though. It's one film that is quite literally unlike anything you have ever, or will ever see. It's a stop motion film about humans and relationships. With everything that this film does it's to hard pick one thing that stands out but I have to say, only having three actors gives this film a whole new meaning. A meaning that I will try not to go into very much because of how much this choice affects the film. But lets talk about what this film is actually about. The film is basically a romantic comedy. However, it isn't the type of romcom that you're thinking of. It's a deathly serious film with black humor sprinkled in. The story follows Michael Stone. A fairly successful author of customer service books. The film takes place over the course of a day or two right up until the speech he is suppose to give regarding his works. Almost immediately it's clear that he is unhappy.He doesn't view the world as a bright shining place anymore. To him it's dull and boring, filled with many people all with the same voice. It seems as if he doesn't care about anyone or anything anymore. Not his family, books, or even random people he happens by. It's a tough character study to watch play out. The more we watch this character the more we can relate him to our own lives.Everyone goes through tough patches like this. Where nothing feels right and nothing that anyone says can change that. It's a deeply moving and complex character study about life. About how easily we as humans move on and grow tired of things. This signifies the absolute best of 'Anomalisa'.But nearly everything else is just as compelling. What the film is able to accomplish with it's cinematography and utilization of stop motion is astounding. The film presents itself as a purposefully flawed reconstruction of the world. The streets are highly detailed and alive while it's people are fluid but a bit cracked. It creates an unmistakable parallel to our human existence that makes this film completely and utterly, real.If there is one complaint I have with this film it's in one particular scene. A scene that is very surreal. It seems to try and blatantly point out what it is trying to say, just in case you weren't paying attention. It may play it off as a sort of premonition but the way it comes across is anything but. I'm not entirely sure why the film felt like it needed to explain what it was trying to say. To me, it was very clear what was happening so, when the film takes a second to stop and explain, it feels very out of place.However, this is a minor flaw in a film that easily shatters conventional film making. It offers an unflinching look at our existence at an appropriately small scale. What Kaufman and Johnson have created is nothing short of awe inspiring. The effort that went into each and every shot is apparent from the get go. It's a beautiful film that longs to be seen and taken to heart."
65,Anomalisa,,26 April 2016,An empty story of a man's life,"This film is an animation featuring a motivational speaker on customer service, who is fed up with his boring life. He meets a woman at his hotel, and his life is turned upside down.The initial twenty minutes bored me much, because Michael's life is so mundane, so non happening. The characters look quite disturbing, as there are lines on faces that make them look android like. The characters strangely enough has monotonous voices, that sound exactly the same. Even female characters have make voices, which makes it confusing at first for me. Though I see why all of the above happens the way they are as the story unfolds towards the end, my opinion towards the film is already formed."
66,Anomalisa,7,14 March 2016,More memorable than enjoyable,"It has been over a month since I say Anomalisa with a few friends. All of us felt a little disappointed with the overall feeling we had at the end of the movie. I think it seemed like an animated short that was too long. The stop-motion figures were slightly distracting at first, but it didn't take too long to start seeing them as real actors. The overall visual effect was at times quite amazing, and even the sex scene felt more real than simply animated. One thing I will say is that this is a film that has remained fairly clear in my memory as time has passed, and in that sense it was impressive. If it shows up on Netflix I might watch it again to get another impression."
67,Anomalisa,5,31 January 2016,Kaufmann turns neurosis into farce in this occasionally clever but decidedly lightweight stop action animation quirk-fest,"Charlie Kaufmann, principally known for Being John Malklovich and Adapation, is back with the very strange Anomalisa, which is based on an earlier stage play of his. Kaufmann raised almost $500,000 through a Kickstarter campaign to fund a film that features marionettes that come to life via stop-motion animation. The two principal characters--Michael Stone, a self-help motivational speaker, and an insecure woman named Lisa whom Michael meets at a hotel--are voiced by David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh. However, the visual models for the principals are based on non- actors Kaufmann discovered outside the usual casting process.The story begins with Michael arriving in Cincinnati and checking in at the ""Fregoli Hotel."" This is a reference to the Fregoli delusion, or the delusion of doubles, which (as Wikipedia informs us), ""is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise."" Indeed, throughout the film, except for Lisa (the woman for whom he falls head over heels for), everyone else has the same male voice and face (voiced by Tom Noonan).Michael's particular delusion suggests that he is both paranoid and narcissistic, unable to form normal relationships with anyone. He calls up an old girlfriend, Bella, and invites her to meet him downstairs at the hotel bar. When he invites her upstairs to his room (presumably for sex), Bella is outraged and storms out.On the way to the hotel, Michael had asked the cab driver where he could find a toy store that was open late, in order to get a present for his son. The driver inadvertently gives him directions to an adult toy store where Michael ends up purchasing a Japanese animatronic woman (the significance of which escapes me). Michael then has a paranoid fit, knocking on all the doors on his floor in the hotel, looking for a ""friend"" who he believes has been looking for him. Instead, two women answer one of the doors he knocks onÂ—and one of the women, Lisa, has her own distinct face and voice. Here Michael finally connects with someone, confirmed by her unique appearance.Michael invites Lisa to his room where she reveals she's insecure, especially about a facial scar that she conceals with her hair. But Michael is captivated and is even more thrilled when she begins singing her own rendition of Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun."" The two then have sex in a fairly graphic scene, not usually seen in films featuring animated marionettes.In perhaps the best scene in the film, Michael has a nightmare where part of his face falls off in the hotel hallway and then is pursued by all the identical people who claim they love him and beg for him not to fall in love with Lisa. When he eats breakfast with Lisa, he can't stand the sounds she makes while eating and hears everyone else's voice over hers. The paranoia reaches its apex when Michael gives his motivational speech at a convention center and begins ranting about US government conspiraciesÂ—the audience there is clearly turned off.When Michael returns home to his family in Los Angeles, his breakdown is complete. He can no longer recognize the guests at a surprise birthday party his wife has thrown for him and becomes blankly absorbed with the Japanese animatronic woman which his son had no interest in as a birthday present. However, in the final scene, Lisa is driving in a car, sitting with her friend, who now has her own face.The irony Kaufmann appears to be conveying is that here is a self- help speaker that the corporate world puts up on a pedestal, who falls into his own world of self-delusion and is unable to motivate himself in any positive way. But Kaufmann doesn't only want us to laugh at StoneÂ—in a sense he also wants us to laugh at his delusions, which represent the foibles of a neurotic and narcissistic society. If you buy into his critique, then you must accept all the frustrated characters that make up Stone's world: a taxicab driver, for example, who deceives himself that his small-talk is truly worthwhile; a robotic bellhop who must be overly pleasing just to get a tip; an office worker masturbating in front of an open window, inviting voyeuristic onlookers; an ex- girlfriend who holds a grudge and can't get over her anger from a breakup long ago; and even a seemingly normal woman who is held back due to insecurities over physical appearance. Kaufmann isn't completely negative about social intercourseÂ—the world outside of everyman Stone and his delusions, can be optimisticÂ— Lisa's friend at the end is no longer a figment of Stone's warped consciousness. Kaufmann's quirk-fest, where he turns neurosis into farce, is occasionally clever but decidedly lightweight. Don't expect to laugh too hard here unless scoffing at a superficial conception of humankind's cluelessness is your thing."
68,Anomalisa,9,30 October 2015,This film is about a man crippled by his mundane boring life but everything changes when he meets Lisa,"This film is sad, gripping, depressing, and just about every other emotion possible crammed into one film. It's directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson. Charlie Kaufman also wrote the film. Charlie Kaufman is my favorite director/writer, four of his movies are in my top ten including this one. I love his work because every movie he makes is so different and original compared to all the Hollywood crap that's made now a days. I was really hyped for this film and so happy I got to see it at the Savannah film festival. So the bar was set high for this movie for me and it and Anomalisa passed that bar with flying colors. It's a beautiful story and Charlie Kaufman makes this movie work even though it shouldn't. I really can't picture any other director making this film. The animation was very different and unique and it should be used in future movies. The voice acting was incredible and it's also a really funny movie. It strikes the balance between drama and comedy nicely. I have pretty much no problems with this movie. The only thing I thought they did wrong was the ending, which I thought ended too abruptly. It will be awhile before anyone else can see this movie, it comes out in theaters in late December and they haven't even released a trailer yet but trust me your going to want to see it. I can see this film being nominated for best animated feature and best writing adapted screenplay. This is my favorite Charlie Kaufman film it's right in front of eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. I really hope this kick starts his career because I'm sure he has more quirky/original ideas to make into movies,"
69,Anomalisa,2,21 March 2016,What a turd of a movie...,"Love Kaufman, looked fwd to this. It sucks. No plot. No likable or relatable characters. No resolution. No conflict. Banality at its worst. Feels ""forced""... nothing feels natural about the way anyone acts or delivers unbelievable dialogue. Main character suddenly changes in the way you'd assume he'd feel & act from the very very very sparse character development. Main character is simultaneously intelligent & understands people (professional speaker & author of books on sales techniques and customer service, or something like that) and completely stupid & out of touch with how normal people act *slight spoiler* (buys a small child a sex doll from a sex shop, that is filled with stranger's cum & gives it to him at a birthday party) Lol, wut?? This movie is garbage.Fin."
70,Anomalisa,7,2 January 2016,interesting animation,"i enjoyed this film mostly because of the animation which is why i gave it a seven rating. if it had been real actors saying the same dialogue i probably would have been bored. for some reason i just found the animation fascinating and that is what kept me watching the film. i don't think the film even comes close to being on the same level as being john Malkovich. now that was a great film and one of my all time favorites. the story in Anomalisa was not original. it is a plot seen a hundred times before with nothing new to say. wait till the movie is on DVD to watch it. that way if you get bored, you can turn it off without wasting too much money."
71,Anomalisa,10,9 January 2016,Simply Amazing...,"Ever since I watched it last night, ""Anomalisa"" has kept popping up in my head. It is a film almost unlike any other, and certainly one of the greatest films I've seen come out in 2015. It's an extremely simple, yet extremely complex, film that takes place over a short amount of time (and is only 90 minutes in length), and there's something about it that is just, simply, amazing. It's so powerful in its structure, using some truly meaningful stylistic choices (a majority of the characters are voiced by the same actor), and the animation is truly miraculous!There's scenes that look like they're one continuous take, and even a (pretty strange, but emotional) sex scene, and yet all of the characters are stop motion animated! All of the meaning behind the film and the powerful story aside, the animation is enough for me to praise the film. Even if it was a badly written and boring movie, I would still be highly praising the animation, because, obviously, tons and tons of work and effort was put into this film, so it should really be appreciated for that reason alone.And, while it is one of the most emotionally draining animated films I've seen, it also has its share of hilarity throughout, and I can remember plenty of times in which I laughed over the course of the film.""Anomalisa"" is one film that deserves tons of praise."
72,Anomalisa,2,15 January 2016,Predator Vs Prey,The fact that the Academy got behind this film only further drives home the point that Hollywood has no idea the power of their storytelling on young lives and that makes me sad for those young folks who will see this film because of the praise it is receiving.When you put behind all the oooohhh's and ahhhh's about how dark this film is I want you to see that at the end of the day you have a man named Michael who is a predator preying upon an insecure much younger girl named Lisa. There are multiple victims of his in this film. Just watch and you will see. Then ask yourself if you can support such storytelling upon our world.
73,Anomalisa,1,26 March 2016,I have no idea what this film was about,"a lot of people walked out half way through the film I wish I had joined them rather than waste 1 1/2 hours of my life Please save yourself some money and avoid, I have no idea what this film was about A weird cartoon with the characters having sex...not a good look My first visit to Curzon at sea containers house possibly my last All very weird! what was surprising was the 100% reviews from the film critics but maybe I should be used to their poor reviewsSo if you want to spend a nice afternoon avoid this film like the plague absolutely pointless!"
74,Anomalisa,2,5 January 2016,thank you all for the reviews,"i came to this site to find out exactly what this movie is about. i still don't really know. Because every rave review reads like an academic thesis. It's this, it's that, it's genius.It's a masterpiece. I think this project seems like a woody allen undertaking but at a much slower pace. The consensus its seems that it was a brilliant film about a mundane life of someone who has given up on the human race. He meets someone who he believes understands him or maybe its his libido whispering. This man's life is boring because he has no laptop or iphone. Because with these items, tagged on a beer ad, life would be much more interesting and fruitful. Because we recognize or even understand this person, so its not really insightful rather just a boring film about nothing,tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. Been there done that. With all this social media, who are you really?."
75,Anomalisa,7,16 October 2016,Both alienates and mesmerises,"Despite being critically acclaimed, 'Anomalisa' seems to have divided audiences. People were left mesmerised and touched by the film, while others were alienated and perplexed by it.After seeing 'Anomalisa' for myself, it is not hard to see why it was acclaimed but at the same time it is not hard to see why it hasn't clicked with some people. Personally think that 'Anomalisa' could have been better, and it would from humble opinion would have worked better as a short film, but its many good points are so well executed that it hard to be too hard on it. Because the visuals, music and voice acting were as wonderful as they were, even if I didn't like the film it would not have gotten less than a 4 or 5.The film apparently was originally intended to be a short film, and it does show because some of the film does feel over-stretched with padded scenes that try to disguise thin plotting (while the sex scene was intimate and touching, it was also drawn-out, somewhat too much so).Some of the first act in particular does fail to maintain momentum, being very draggy and uneventful in places. For example, the scenes intensely detailing Michael leaving the airport, checking into the hotel and going to the room could have either been trimmed or omitted and it would not have harmed the story at all. The ending is one that is open to interpretation, don't mind these kind of endings but this one felt sudden and abrupt, the ambiguity suggestive of Kaufmann being unsure as how to end the film.However, 'Anomalisa' looks absolutely amazing, the stop-motion style having such a beauty and realism to it as well as imaginative in its detail. When it comes to animated films this year, stylistically 'Anomalisa' definitely stands out when it comes to uniqueness. The music score is hypnotic and dream-like while also touchingly understated.When it comes to the script there are some very thought-provoking and poetic moments, while the narratively-linear story achieves a fine balance of the distinctively-Kaufmann psychologically surreal (such as Michael reading the letter from an ex-lover and imagining her presence and Michael's dream, which was wonderfully strange), the painfully sad and the achingly humane. While some have said that they didn't get a lot out of 'Anomalisa', while not thematically original exactly the film does say a lot profound to me of the repetitiveness of relationships, it's the inside that counts and of the necessity of believing we and our loved ones are special.The characters are neurotic (almost on the same level of the neurose-ridden characters in a Woody Allen film), especially Michael, but there was something about the touching chemistry between Michael and Lisa and their introvertedness (coming from a fairly introverted person myself) that appealed to me even if they were deliberately not the most likable in the world. The voice acting is hard to fault.Jennifer Jason Leigh clearly put her heart and soul into Lisa and David Thewlis is similarly terrific. Meanwhile it was truly mesmerising as to how Tom Noonan voiced all the rest of the characters (essential to the point that the film made about sounding the same, or 'same voice', which would only have worked really with one voice doing them) and still managed to make them distinct from one another, not many people can do that.Overall, a polarising film that will mesmerise viewers but alienate others. With me, it alienated at first and it would have worked better as a short film as intended originally but mostly found it very rewarding sticking with it. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
76,Anomalisa,7,28 March 2016,A film that left me dazed and confused,"After having seen 'Anomalisa', I left the cinema dazed and confused. The question is: what does that say about the film? Is it a recommendation, or the opposite? I'm not sure. In the case of 'Anomalisa', the story is not the most important thing. But still: it is about a marketing guru who is in psychological trouble. The movie shows the hours before an important speech, when he meets a woman with whom he feels a connection. There was a lot about the film I didn't understand. Many strange things are happening. Women speaking with a man's voice, for example, or faces falling apart. Unexpected events occur, and weird behaviour. At first, I considered this a drawback. After all, a film is supposed to show everything the director has put into it. Or could it be that this is not the case? That it's alright if questions remain, problems are left unsolved, meanings stay unclear? After having spent time reading about the film on IMDb, I am inclined to answer these last questions in a positive way. Some, but not all things are clearer to me now. Director Charlie Kaufman doesn't expect the viewer to 'get' everything after the first watch. And maybe that makes it a better film than if everything had been clear from the beginning. Still, I'm not convinced that this film is the ultimate masterpiece many critics claim it to be. Sure, it is a masterful film about the human condition. The use of stop-motion technology makes it something special and out of the ordinary. And the combination of deadpan humour and deep despair is clever. But on the other hand, there is no denying that this film is very pretentious, and undoubtedly goes over the heads of a lot of moviegoers. It almost went over mine."
77,Anomalisa,6,1 January 2016,Existential cartoon with dazzling animation leaves a lingering feeling of deja vu,"I had a feeling of deja vu as I was watching Anomalisa, then I remembered seeing the almost universally reviled Neil La Bute film ""Dirty Weekend"", which I saw not in its entirety but enough to recognize one too many coincidences. Middle aged man on a business trip?: check; chat with an intrusive cab driver?: check; recommendation from the aforementioned cab driver of a toy store that turns out to be a sex toy store: check; interaction with a much younger female character?: check. Probably Neil La Bute thought an explicit sex scene would be too creepy given the age difference, restraint that Kaufman did not have (these are just toons, aren't they?) Well, I still feel that I need to re-watch Anomalisa, even though I think the philosophical wrap up came a little too late into the movie which is burdened by a lot of flat dialogue. I can easily see someone getting sued over copyright infringement here. Or maybe it's that we all live inside of Philip Kaufman's head and Dirty Weekend and Anomalisa are the same movie because Being John Malcovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind are the only unique ones."
78,Anomalisa,8,9 September 2016,9 out of 10 people will probably not like it.,"Let's talk 2001 - A Space Odyssey. A masterpiece! But... really? Did you watch it? Did you prevent all the praise from altering your memory? Let me remind you: it has long, drawn out sequences of utter boredom, flat generic characters without any depth whatsoever, overly technical meaninglessness throughout most of it. It is truly anti-immersive. Heck, for everybody who's ""so into it"" it has a three minutes black screen, mockingly called an ""Intermezzo"", to kick you out of it! So honestly: did you *really* enjoy it? Eventually I did. After writing a paper about it in a philosophy class, learning to appreciate it. Before? Not so much. It is literally painful to watch. You know that gut feeling somewhere between shame, boredom and some unnamed fear. Tormenting truly. It is *meant* to be like that. To cause that sort of pain, the loss of control, the boredom: it is a thin line and hard to get right. Even if hitting the spot it is not entertaining - nor meant to be. Why don't I refer to the film this is supposedly about? Well: there hardly is an easy to name plot and saying anything meaningful about it would likely result in a spoiler. The feel, despite a few comic reliefs, is very reminiscent of 2001 as I see it. That's not referring to the quality - I'll leave that to you to judge. Personally it really touched me. That's not the same as saying that it is great, let alone that you'd ""have to watch it"". Stay away if you just want some fun. Perhaps I can give one thing away: puppets really do allow to depict sexuality without being pretentious, which is extremely hard to do. Other very human things, like a specific uptake on beauty, could not have been done this well had it been life actors. The monotony that's a centerpiece here also relies heavily on these puppets in order to be shown without attracting attention. That's extremely well done and a testimony of the form being correctly chosen to carry the content."
79,Anomalisa,3,15 August 2016,"Flat, vulgar, cardboard interpretation of 'Lost in Translation'","I am perplexed by all the positive acclaim for this movie. Technically, it's been done well, but... the substance? Lacking. As if someone watched 'Lost in translation', didn't really get it, and then decided to do another take at it but without all the charm and finesse. Just as my title says, I did find it vulgar, boring, and shallow. Characters are unlikeable and the whole approach to getting into the select human life crisis problems is very crude. Mah. Just watch 'Lost in Translation' again, spare yourself. Why am I supposed to write at least ten lines of text now? This is ridiculous. Some movies do not deserve this much and this is idiotic. Now I want to rant about the IMDb mobile app that made the whole thing absolutely useless... This is piece of garbage, and with every version it gets from bad to worse, defying all the lows. Here."
80,Anomalisa,8,14 April 2016,Beautiful and overwhelming!,"Anomalisa is a rare take on human insouciance towards things that one becomes accustomed to.I have rarely seen a movie so eloquently shot to capture human emotions in the most vivid way possible. It is unafraid to scale horizons of the bold, yet humble enough to revisit tattered fronts of human nature. The cast is just, well, three people Â– David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noonan who weave the character voices to perfection. Jennifer's voice will make you fall in love with Lisa instantly. Her character is the most relatable. She is something when she breaks into a candid conversation. It is hard not to feel sorry for her when things go south on her.The stop-motion animation that the movie bides by is just magnificent. You can almost read the efforts put in by the director Duke Johnson and Charlie Kaufman to create continuous shots of pizazz. Ice all that up with brilliant expressions that its characters pack in and we end up with a spectacular flick in our baggage. Screenplay steers to create wonders as we feast on some beautiful words at a haywire juncture.SPOILERS AHEAD: The plot takes us unto a frontage where we come to realize, that's how it is. That's how the world works! People are going to feel incomplete. Love is ephemeral. The moment it meets time, it becomes chaotic. Fills up with indifference and then we start searching for that spark again.The most unique thing about the movie is the way it carries the voice-over for women. It tries to portray the indifference the protagonist carries for every woman on the planet through a male cacophonous voice. He is on the prowl for that melodious voice once again, here spark, which let him feel something once. The scavenge ends up taking us to the Anomaly, Lisa. She seems perfect until indifference slays her too.This movie makes you ponder hard. If you really look at it, you cannot possibly take sides. You cannot just feel sorry for Lisa here, and ignore Michael Stone. There's an Anomalisa in everyone's life which seems harmonious at first, and then suddenly disintegrates to ruins because of some abomination. You cannot simply ignore the horrific dream he has either. It reeks of Stone's crude life that is trying to devour him. A stunning representation and well-thought of too.You can relate to the character in the movie Â– Aloof from the world, but then a chord just sounds right enough to make you interested again. Then boom! out of the blue something makes it dissonant once again. Well, that's life for you.Intelligent take. Bravo!"
81,Anomalisa,9,17 March 2016,A beautiful portrayal of the fragility and futility of humanity,"In management speak, it's pretty fair to say that Charlie Kaufman tends to think outside the box. Eternal Sunshine, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation are all fabulously madcap films, but for all the dreamy sequences and oddball sci-fi, all have one particular element at their core; the unforgiving exploration of humanity. For Anomalisa, Kaufmann teams up with Duke Johnson to create a stop motion puppet animation which yet again tunnels into parts of the commonplace human psyche that are so regularly ignored.Michael Stone (Thewlis), author and respected customer service guru, has travelled to Ohio where he is to give a keynote conference speech. After a couple of awkwardly failed attempts at making his single evening in the hotel interesting, he relishes the devotion of two girls who have travelled hours to attend his speech, and slowly starts to view anxious, self-deprecating Lisa (Jason Leigh) as the perfect remedy to all his troubles.Every person Stone speaks to converses in the exact same voice, a demonstration that everyone in his life, his wife and son included, is regarded with equivalent obscurity, merely another supporting actor in his progressively egoistic home movie. The tight-lipped frustration at his wife's insistence that he speaks to his young son on the phone is wonderfully telling. Even the hotel he stays at, the Fregoli, is a reference to a rare condition in which the sufferer imagines that every individual is in fact the same single person in disguise.Anomalisa focuses on the mundane, the sensation of futility of one's own existence through the daily grind of life. Stone relentlessly exhibits the amplified fragility and volatility of emotions of the crisis-hit middle aged man. The movie illustrates the mounting realisation that life may not hold the unyielding delights that one once thought it would, how even success can be insignificant in comparison to the ever increasing need for something more, something stimulating. One of the movie's most devastating emotional tricks is to expose how disappointingly temporary newfound experiences really are once reality settles back in.Possibly the most remarkable thing about Anomalisa is that despite the character's appearance being obviously puppet-like (the joins in the face are intentionally noticeable), you quickly forget this is an animation, so impeccable are the sentiments, flaws and passions given to the individuals by the plot and dialogue. A heartrending emotional attachment to Stone and Lisa is impossible to avoid as you cringingly share their awkwardness and needy sexual tension towards one another.Thewlis is a genius piece of casting as his slow melancholic northern English delivery perfectly corresponds to Stone's solitude, irritability and desperation for attention. At no point do you deliberate his or Jason Leigh's voiceovers, such is the flawlessly intrinsic match between voice and character.Anomalisa is desperately sad, brutally truthful and viciously funny. It is exceptionally rare to be able to genuinely label a movie unique, but Anomalisa is about as close to that as you're ever likely to get. It is a glorious, perfect masterpiece of a movie."
82,Anomalisa,9,16 March 2016,Anomalisa,"Anomalisa is the newest film by Charlie Kaufman, easily one of the most clever and ingenious writers of all time, constantly churning out fantastic, original screenplays. His previous films include Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which deals with the way we process memories and the value of them, Adaptation, which is a film that says a lot about the way we view films, Being John Malkovich, a comedy about the idea of going into somebody else's body, Synecdoche, New York, a film about the human mind and various large themes and issues, and now Anomalisa. Now, I've loved every single film I've seen from Charlie Kaufman and I'm glad to say that this one fits in perfectly with the rest.From a technical point of view, this film is fantastic (but thank God it goes so much deeper than just from a technical point of view). Charlie Kaufman wrote a fantastic screenplay for this film, but Duke Johnson helped significantly with the animation, so a lot of the credit should go to him as well. The idea of doing this whole film in stop motion is astounding considering that there are many moving parts in some of the shots and there are many tracking shots that go on for a very long time, which means that they needed to get everything perfect in these shots or they would have to scratch a lot of the work that they put into it. Also, this being an animation and all, it's surprising how deeply human the story is, and how human the characters feel (and by characters I mean just Lisa and Michael), which ties directly into the main themes of the movie, which I will discuss later. Also, the one main quality that Duke and Charlie gave all of the characters again adds a new level of depth to the movie and is there to support the themes, not just for style.Michael is a famous writer, and while many people know him, it seems he doesn't truly know anyone else. He has written a book about customer service, so he knows how to converse with people, but he he can'take seem to connect with anyone. Michael looks around and sees all of the same faces, and the same voices. He looks around and sees people talking, arguing, and connecting everywhere, but none of it means anything to him anymore. However, when Michael stumbles upon Lisa, he finds that he's finally found someone that is different, someone that seems human again. But that quickly fades as Michael begins to realize her flaws, the things that annoy him and he quickly finds himself being distanced from her like everyone else.But Michael needs to do what he came there to do, which is give his speech about customer service. Yet when Michael looks out over the crowd, all he sees is the same face, and he begins to break down. He asks ""What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be alive?"", and frankly, this film makes me question the same things. Without our individuality, what are we? If everyone had the same face and the same voice, how could we truly connect to anyone? Without our own face we could be mistaken for robots, not humans. They say appearances aren't what make us human, but this film makes a strong case against that. When Michael is left alone and depressed, not even being able to recognize his own family, it seems the closest thing he has to human is a broken Chinese singing toy. It may be a machine, but at least it looks and sounds different. At least it's an individual."
83,Anomalisa,6,12 March 2016,Anomalisa is a brave little film...but not 'transcendental' in the slightest,"I do sometimes wonder at the 'wit and wisdom' of film critics when they say things like: "" (This film is) A rare sliver of transcendence"".I'm given to the odd, smart-ass sounding sound bite myself, the sort of line that a sub- editor could easily pick up for a killer, attention grabbing headline.But thankfully managed to reign most of that in for this beautifully produced, stop-motion ride to nowhere in particular.Charlie Kaufman's (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) brave and much admired dive into the unknown is at least to be respected and welcomed as a departure from the norm."
84,Anomalisa,6,15 February 2016,Unusual animation,"Michael Stone is a fantastic character. Shut within a hotel, he opts for atypical behavior. In a certain way he does not want to be alone and starts looking for someone to make him ""smile"" and not feel lonely after an exhausting journey. Everything happens in a slow pace inside a place we all have had the chance to witness - a hotel. Despite his monotonous and sad personal life, he recalls why he arrived to this status. Firstly, he finds features in a girl that astonish him till the point to escape from reality. But eventually, he starts finding imperfections which points out he cannot be recovered from what he has become. There is something that is constantly affecting him negatively. Secondly, this story is about him and the rest of the world. In that amount, there is only one person that really grabs his attention - Lisa. Because all the others are equal, even with the same voice, he finds her as an anomaly and tries to figure out what does she has as an identity. Subsequently, he realizes all this delusion he created for himself. Thus, the impossibility to win the fight with his emotions has failed again. You can be famous, rich and have a marvelous family, but happiness starts from the inner. His sorrowful face almost all the movie is an inference that denotes imperfection. Perhaps Lisa's mellifluous voice can change that for a while but what is the point of it if he has to come back afterward to the real life which makes him sad? Is it a good idea to do so or it will be better not to regret like Bella's story? The best deduction from the movie is the fact that because he is not perfect inside himself, he is kind of attracted to woman's physical imperfection that might be perfect in the inside. A movie that reminds me of Wallace and Gromit in a combination with The Science of Sleep."
85,Anomalisa,9,12 February 2016,"Brilliant and mature, ""Anomalisa"" is one of Charlie Kaufman's best movies","""Anomalisa"" is the first animated movie by Charlie Kaufman, and his followup to his directorial debut ""Synecdoche New York"". Though not as expansive in scope as that Synecdoche, Anomalisa is still a fascinating and intimate look at two strangers that meet for a one night stand, have a connection and share their vulnerabilities with one another. When I saw the trailer, I thought that this would be atypical of Kaufman, a straight forward love story that happened to be animated. I was wrong. It's got funny moments and the movie is surreal (everyone besides Michael and Lisa are voiced by Tom Noonan), but at it's core, the film is about a broken man who is discontent with life that tries to find a connecting with another lonely person, even if it's just temporary. Michael Stone (David Thewlis) travels from L.A. to Ohio to give a speech about his book on customer service. He's well regarded and is married, with a loving family, but feels a disconnect from the world around him, seeing everyone as the same person, and haunted by the memories of his ex-wife. There are many great scenes in the movie, especially his encounter with his ex-girlfriend which he left abruptly one day without saying goodbye. The mix of stop motion animation and puppetry is unique and wholly original. You can feel the pain and resentment the characters have in this scene, and it's helped by the great performances from Thewlis and Noonan. Jennifer Jason Leigh is brilliant as well, playing the childlike Lisa, the only person in the world that stands out in Michael's eyes. She's very doubting of herself and vulnerable, but also charming, kind and funny. The scenes two share together are the highlight of the film, being realistic as well as dramatic, and funny - hitting all the right beats. The sex scene in the movie is very well done as well, not being clinically removed from real life, nor explicit. It's just two people trying to connect physically and emotionally, and it's convincingly real.If voice acting were more recognized as a talent, then Thewlis should have been nominated for an academy award for his character portrayal, especially near the end when he gives his speech and ends up exposing his vulnerabilities and fears to the crowd. It's pretty heart wrenching stuff. ""Anomalisa"" is one of the most mature, well written movies of the year, animated or otherwise. It has the technical marvels of other movies (co-directed by Duke Johnson, from ""Morel Orel"", the long camera takes for a movie like this are incredible), but it doesn't make that the core point of interest for viewers to be impressed by. It's the quieter moments of reflection and loss, the ones that dwell on us later for us to mull over and think about that are truly impressive."
86,Anomalisa,7,11 February 2016,"The mixture of painful souls, copulating puppets, and animatronics is just too weird.","It's risky to hype an animated film as a ""masterpiece"" but calling it the ""most human movie of the year"" is particularly brave. As we know, marketing is the art of labelling faults as virtues and in this case the hype disguises the film's absence of humanity, morality or narrative purpose. Filmed entirely in stop-motion animation, it uses innovative technology to produce an emotionally vacuous tale based entirely on one of the oldest clichÃ©s in storytelling: a successful male's mid-life neurosis about his shallow existence and his existential dilemmas.While many audiences will find cleverness in the script, if it were delivered by human actors it would be bland and even ridiculous. This means that the entire production rests on audiences finding it amusing to hear puppets speak deep and meaningful thoughts, similar to movies where dogs or horses say cute things in a local accent. This time bland is given new meaning as every 'character' has the same voice except for Lisa's, the anomaly whose name is embedded in the title. While this device may be intended to emphasis her individuality in his mundane life, it actually results in a monotonous soundtrack un-suited to probing ""what it means to be human"" as if an animated movie with expressionless puppets might have the answer.Of course, it's a powerless, uneducated and insecure female who is the inevitable victim of yet another middle-age male melt-down over self-identity, marital and girlfriend issues. When the permanently apologetic Lisa is discarded after a one-night stand she drifts into soft-focus while his crisis anchors the semi-climax. Clay animation techniques are slow and detailed, and the patience to create almost 120,000 separate frames is unimaginable. But this may be the metaphor for the film's major failing. It dwells so heavily on the minutiae of technique and script sophistry that it overlooks its reliance on an old and dated narrative clichÃ©. While it is an entertaining, original and interesting attempt to go somewhere different, for me it felt like a Muppets episode narrated by Aristotle. The mixture of painful souls, copulating puppets, and animatronics is just too weird."
87,Anomalisa,1,26 August 2016,Dangerously Misanthropic?,"How many movies have we seen about people who claim to find true love (often celebrated in goofy romps through field and stream), but feel united only through their intense dislike of the less-goofy rest of the human race? The essence of discrimination and prejudice is lumping people into categories, a generic sameness where individuality is lost.Whether done by race, sex or religion, it can lead to horrible abuses of human rights, and it is no less dangerous when applied to humanity as a whole (even if 'the misanthropes', would be horrified to hear themselves categorized as prejudiced: ""Don't pay any attention to his opinion. He's just one of them damn bigoted Misanthorpes."")Every individual is unique, and if you look hard enough you will find what makes them so. You might even find more goodness than you thought possible. People in customer service businesses are easy to take a swipe at-they are required to be obsequious, and wear thick personas. Most of them know that. (I have a feeling though, that Mr Kaufman may not get out much these days, or he would not have missed the opportunity to have waiters praising dinner choices as ""awe- some"", and ""perr-fect"".)The fact that the only people Michael could see as non-robotic were ones as completely insecure as the self-flagellating Bella and Lisa, suggests his nature may be that of a predator (That comes out a bit with his snapping on Lisa's taking the slightest initiative.)If the intention of Mr Kaufman was too show that the problem in the perceived sameness of 99.999999999 % of the human race has more to do with Michael's problems than the people, I could cut the movie some slack; there certainly are suggestions of that, but the smell of misanthropy is still strong. What then, does that say about the small army of collaborators interviewed in the typically sycophantic special feature? Why didn't someone say "" Whoa, what are we doing here? What are we feeding into?"""
88,Anomalisa,2,2 April 2016,Waste of time!  Doesn't develop at all.  Incredibly boring!,"This has to be the most boring movie I've ever seen. I finally had hope that maybe it would progress to something more interesting,during the morning after seen, but then it went back to just being trite and boring. Please don't waste your time watching this crap. Even after a few drinks, it's still boring. Did anyone actually pay to watch this in a theater? I hope not. I'm told I have to write at least ten lines of text in order to submit this review but the movie is so simple and silly that I don't know how I can even write that much! OK, there were two interesting parts; the part where the main character has his face drop off, thus showing that he, and everyone else is a robot of some type, and the other part was when the customer service person said that he loved the main character. One would hope that a good writer would work on those points and develop them into something worth while. Some good payoff at the end. Maybe just leave us with something! But... Nope. Nothing. After the entire movie, we're left with nothing at all. No conclusion, no insights, nothing. Maybe I'm just stupid, but I don't get it. Don't waste your time! Really!"
89,Anomalisa,9,7 January 2016,Unique - surprisingly unique - thumbs up!,"An odd film kept me awake last night - ANOMALISA - animated movie using stop animation technique (you know wallace n gromit etc etc). For some reason this style of animation kind of gives me the creeps. The work that goes into it astounds me - the patience required... Not entirely sure why - something about certain animation feels dark and a bit supernatural to me and makes me anxious. go figure. This animated wonder took over 7 years to make and reportedly cost 8 million dollars - the animation process, facial features, clothing, subtle movements all look wonderful. The lighting is used beautifully just to emphasize minute details.This film is written and Directed by Charlie Kaufman who most will know for Being John Malkovich. I disliked that movie (I quite enjoyed ADAPTATION however) but Being John Malkovich was a bizarre idea and somewhere I missed the depth and a lot of the humour most people found within. ANOMALISA is a very very unique film. The main character Michael Stone is a motivational speaker and best selling author about customer service. He is visiting L.A. for a one day conference.. An odd career for Michael to have as he is not exactly a barrel of laughs at this time in his life. Maybe a mid life crisis? Michael is a very moody impatient guy who does not suffer small talk or fools gladly. His mind is somewhere else, he hates small talk (he makes wonderful facial expressions to reflect this) but he is searching for something. Constantly. He checks into a fairly plush hotel and proceeds to do the usual mundane things like turning on the tele switching channels with remote, ordering food, goes to the bar- boring mundane stuff and honestly it FEELS boring. About fifteen minutes into the film after the impressive eye candy animation wore off a bit I was questioning just why this animation picture was even made? Was Charlie Kaufman just trying to be clever here? Not to say this film is humourless but I almost stopped watching.. The mundane existence of Michael's evening was having the desired effect. Which is kind of the point.You are following one persons night, one particularly ordinary guy.... yet the intrigue is there - why is Michael the way he is? Why does everyone he speak to have the same vocal tone, the same voice be they male or female. After mulling about his hotel room for a while he decides to call an ex partner. An ex he abruptly and seemingly finished with for selfish reasons. This ex relationship is worrying him. He is still searching for something. The missing piece.. HIS missing piece, his joy, his reason for being. Now for the most part I felt Michael was not just introverted but a very selfish man seeking only his pleasure. I could relate to that - that longing for something whilst everything around is a dark irritable distraction. The night takes a huge U turn for Michael when he meets a special lady who SOUNDS different and moves him profoundly - could she be his missing piece? I have said FAR more than required about this film - let me just say it lingers, it deserves repeat viewings and today I am thinking it could be a wee masterpiece. Not just a marvelous animated feature, but a bloody profound film. You will get a lot out of it. Probably the day after though...Special mention goes to a lengthy sex scene which anyone could relate to (unless you have only EVER slept with one person). A panic attack during breakfast and a barmy feverish dream sequence. Oh and finally the vocal talents by Jennifer Jason Leigh and David Thewlis (you might not know his name but you will know the actor).Check it out - stick it out."
90,Anomalisa,,23 February 2017,Anomalies,"Bored and lonely, a motivational speaker is drawn towards a young woman at his hotel with a unique voice in this animated drama from the pen of Charlie Kaufman. As per Kaufman's earlier works, the film tackles issues of personal identity, alienation and desperation, and while his self-centred protagonist here is hard to warm to, it is easy to relate to his desire for something more in life. The irony at hand also strikes a chord as he is hardly motivated despite his career and as he teaches businesses how to interact with employees and customers when he is unable to relate to everyone he meets himself. Clocking in at close to 90 minutes though, the film runs incredibly long given the slim basic story and it is little surprise to learn that the movie was originally intended to be a short. The choice to have Tom Noonan voice every character (other than the two main ones) also backfires. Sure, him doing so makes Jennifer Jason Leigh's voice sound just as unique as the protagonist finds it to be when he first hears her; on the same account though, Noonan's voicing of all female characters opens the way for unintentional chuckles, only sounding more ridiculous when voicing a preteen son. A nightmarish sequence in the final 25 minutes almost propels the film in an entirely new and innovative direction, but it is merely misdirection as the film subsequently continues on same path as before. Perhaps that is the point of the film: that changing one's life is never as easy as it seems. This is a thought-provoking film for sure, but one's patience with it may vary."
91,Anomalisa,8,18 December 2016,Don't give up on Charlie Kaufman!,"Even after ""Synecdoche, NY"" and that TV pilot that FX didn't pick up, I still hadn't lost faith in Charlie Kaufman, though fans hoping for another metaphysical blowout like ""Adaptation"" or ""Malkovich"" may be disappointed by this oneÂ—a 90â€² meditation on loneliness, alienation and identity (or the lack thereof), performed by a cast of stumpy little puppets in stop-motion animation. (CK shares directing credit with puppetmeister Duke Johnson.) I should also mention that he spends maybe a third of the film's running time detailing the annoying and dehumanizing aspects of an overnight stay in a Cincinnati conference hotel Our bummed-out protagonist, Michael, is a motivational speaker who lectures customer service reps on how to increase productivity by turning routine transactions into real human interactions; judging by his pained responses to a chatty cabdriver and an oversolicitous bellhop, it's a skill he hasn't mastered yet himself. As a symbol (or maybe a symptom) of his failure to connect, everyone he talks to speaks with the same thin, affectless voice (supplied by character actor Tom Noonan), except oneÂ—Lisa, a sweet-natured, fairly basic young woman with a captivating voice all her own (that of Jennifer Jason Leigh, no less). David Thewlis's wintry Manchester accent is perfect for Michael. Their brief encounter, including a labor-intensive puppet sex scene, is tender, charming and totally unexpected (by me at least), though CK undercuts the impact of their scenes together, and the poignancy of what follows, with cryptic clues that suggest that Lisa is just a figment of Michael's love-starved imagination, that he has somehow willed her into existence (after you've seen the film, Google ""Anomalisa Japanese sex doll"" for some intriguing online theorizing). I watched it twice; the first time through I was skeptical, but once it was clear that this one wasn't going to be another sad-assed dud like ""Synecdoche,"" I was totally caught up in the Kaufman magic. Word of advice: keep a close eye on the faces of the two characters in the very last scene."
92,Anomalisa,9,15 October 2016,An visual delight and unexpected surprise. *mild* spoiler,"I wasn't sure what to think during the first 18 minutes of this movie. The first things you notice is they use the same voice actor for everyone but the main character, and the script wasn't seemingly going anywhere. What kept me fascinated however, was the animation. The number of frames and attention to the most subtle of human details, made you feel as if .. these models, had a very life of their own, and here you are, watching it unfold. At about the 18 minutes mark, the blunt of the movie's subject matter becomes clear. Nothing was wasted. Getting through the seemingly annoying part had purpose and blended to the overall plot. Which made an otherwise uncomfortable build up, exceedingly worth it.Certain deep facial lines on the models, seemed to distract from the performance, but even those are explained within the confines of the story itself. Never did I expect a stop motion animated film, to instill such humanity into the figures themselves. Even without the superb plot line, even muting the entire film, you get a serene and realistic feeling that can only be described as, breathtaking. Some might be a bit disturbed to find such humanity displayed from seemingly inanimate objects. But once that internal struggle dissolves, an immersive visual delight begins."
93,Anomalisa,,9 August 2016,Michael's circle,"it is weird, profound, bizarre, magnificent or too confuse. a masterpiece or a waste of time. for one the realism of marionettes is the most important virtue. for other the reflection of personal universe. because Anomalisa is just a portrait. a social portrait. about lost of meaning of life. about the absence of certitude. about fears. about the result of globalization. the film is far to be a challenge. or to be weird. the incapacity to have normal relationship, the need to have the other as support for be yourself, paranoia, the lost of personality, the life out the faith, convictions or joy, the work as refuge, the hungry of pleasure are pieces of a film who has not the purpose to be impressive or good entertainment but to become a form of wake up. sure, it could be boring and strange, a game of three voices and not comfortable marionettes or scenes for adults in a territory associated with the children. but the animation is the best form for send the message. because this is real simple - Michael Stone is/could be me."
94,Anomalisa,10,8 August 2016,Charlie Kaufman does it again!,"This is a purely underrated movie. It is not only different in terms of the animation and voice acting, but the initial plot as well, which was very moving and had me wondering where certain things were going. Tip: If you walk out of this movie and don't know if you liked it or not, but still found several things you liked from the movie, keep thinking about the movie, and it will grow on you. There is also a great metaphor in the movie that proves that Charlie Kaufman is the biggest genius in Hollywood. Or, wherever he makes his movies. But, yeah, supports artists like Kaufman, instead of terribly acted and terribly produced horror movies, or atrocious fart joke comedies. But, seriously. See this movie. It's quite brilliant."
95,Anomalisa,10,24 July 2016,was not expecting this,"EDIT:The trailer made it seem like this was some delightfully quirky indie-comedy romance. It didn't take the direction I expected, but it was an amazing movie and totally worthy of the praise it's gotten. I thought they were going to romanticize Michael cheating with Lisa, of how Lisa's voice is the only one he really hears and how he's finally met her. I thought it would be like a poetic love story, but in the end Lisa's voice also fades into complete obscurity.it's Michael that is hiding people from himself. Maybe it's to his fault. but maybe it's not."
96,Anomalisa,7,3 July 2016,Different,"This is a very different kind of movie. Clay figures are used instead of real actors to tell the story. Michael Stone(voice of David Thewlis) is a customer service expert and author of a book on the topic who travels to Cincinnati to give a lecture at a hotel. Mike is a bit of an oddball with deep personal problems. He phones an old girlfriend to meet him at the bar with very disastrous results. Afterwards, at the lobby he meets two women who have read his self help book and they join him for drinks at the bar. One of the women, Lisa, is a troubled girl with her own set of issues. She and Michael hook up and this leads up to a strangest, and almost x rated encounter between puppets that I have ever witnessed. This is not an animated film for the kids. My strongest criticism is the use of an actor's voice, Tom Noonan, for all of the other characters, including women other than Lisa. It is obvious from the start that the voice is not a woman's. Overall, I was entertained by Anomalisa, and give it a 7/10."
97,Anomalisa,10,28 June 2016,A very human thought provoking gem!,"Anomalisa tells the story of Michael Stone, husband, father and respected author of ""How May I Help You Help Them?"" is a man crippled by the mundanity of his life. On a business trip to Cincinnati, where he's scheduled to speak at a convention of customer service professionals, he checks into a Hotel. There, he is amazed to discover a possible escape from his desperation in the form of an unassuming Akron baked goods sales rep, Lisa. Anomalisa has brilliant animation and this story about romance takes an unexpected turn that makes you truly care for the characters as well as there conflict. The characters were very human and repeatable. This is a movie that has been creeping its way into my thoughts and is truly excellent. I'm giving this one a 10/10."
98,Anomalisa,6,27 April 2016,Silicon actors with a minimal story,"I'm a huge fan of Charlie Kaufman's writing and his projects outside the mainstream and in this film he do it again, but here I felt a little disappointed cause the spectacular work of puppet animation it's disproportionate in front of a script that is too small, specially compared to the enormous effort, technical and artistic, developed to do this movie (maybe because the initial project actually was a short film of 40 minutes, which was lengthening, lengthening...) And when you finish to watch it the feeling that remains is having enjoyed the wide range of skills (of the animators and decorators in miniature) but also that half of the length of the footage was not necessary. In any case for film fans Anomalisa it's a must see because in the near future possibly all independent feature films are like this: silicone actors with minimal stories."
99,Anomalisa,6,25 October 2016,Original and Inventive without a story or heart,"Anomalisa is the story of an accomplished author, Michael Stone (Thewlis). His accounts of loneliness are captured by having every person around him have the same face and the same voice (Noonan). Not until he meets Lisa (Leigh), a woman who has her own voice and changes his view on life. It is an intriguing and different take on a familiar premise, and that is what I enjoyed about Anomalisa. This movie separates itself from every other movie by branding itself as an anomaly. It will go through great efforts to make you think you are watching a work of high art, and in a sense Anomalisa is a work of art, it is an anomaly of a movie. It has incredible life like stop motion work with was directed excellently by Duke Johnson and Charlie Kauffman. It is visually impressive with extra emphasis placed on the lighting of the movie and the voice acting from all three people in the movie. This movie is very well lit and very with filmed, it almost makes up for the lack of story or character development. This is a very original movie, nothing like what I have seen before. Despite the slow pacing to build up to Lisa, Anomalisa kept my interest for the first two acts. I wondered how every little thing mentioned in the plot, be it Michael's ex girlfriend, the toy that he bought his son, his press conference he was giving the next day and even Lisa would fit into the conclusion. However, it doesn't, because there is no conclusion.Ultimately what this movie lacks is character development, Michael is the same person at the beginning of the movie and at the end of the movie. He has not learned anything about life and neither have I. Because of this fact, this movie also does not have a story, it is essentially an exercise of futility. This movie will try to make you think it has a deep and profound message about life and love, without actually having a message at all. The majority of my problems lie within the third act of the movie. Michael and Lisa have sex and all seems to go well for Lisa, until she starts to sound like everyone else (Noonan) to Michael, in which case he hits-then-quits Lisa, and not even for the right reasons, which makes Michael kind of unlikable. Really the only character I cared about in the end was Lisa, until she actually wrote him a letter thanking him and thinking they will meet again when the timing is right. It paints Lisa as kind of unintelligent and a weak character who enjoyed being hit-then-quit.Anomalisa really only has one plot, and it does not match the beauty of its animation nor the quality of its direction, stop-motion work voice work and lighting. Anomalisa is not that hard to understand though, its narrative structure is simple but it makes you want to believe its challenging and has an ambiguous ending, despite its story's circular pattern. If you want to see a great 2015 animated movie that deals with a lonely protagonist undergoing complex emotions, that makes you both laugh and cry and has a great story and well realized characters, I would watch Pixar's Inside Out."
100,Anomalisa,9,18 December 2015,"""Anomalisa"" is Another Unique and Breathtaking Cinematic Experience.","Charlie Kaufman is an outstanding filmmaker, having crafted unique stories like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."" Those movies explore the complexities of the human condition, intimate emotions and unrequited love.""Anomalisa"" continues that trend. This was Kaufman's latest directorial effort after the overlooked ""Synedoche, New York"". And in his first stop-motion animation project with Duke Johnson, he presents a somber picture of a middle-aged man in the verge of loneliness. Soul-searching, he stumbles upon a woman named Lisa. And there goes an essential tale that examines and challenges the human spirit.With the right mind and soul, you will get every inch of meaning that Kaufman always conveys in his works. And in courtesy of the seamless stop-motion craft (though the designs are kind of perplexing) and the splendid voice cast of just David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noonan, it is simple to just get immersed on a transcending experience. One can easily mint every subtle detail, dealing with the ups and downs of soul-searching. But one must truly experience this in the big screen."
101,Anomalisa,8,11 January 2016,"Interesting, but the protagonist is a jerk","Michael Stone (David Thewlis) is a Brit living in America. An expert on customer service, he is to deliver a speech in Cincinnati. His life, and perhaps his reality (hey, it's a Charlie Kaufman film!) are falling apart around him, and he is depressed with the mundanity surrounding him. In particular, every human being sounds exactly the same to him (and are all voiced by Tom Noonan). While spending the night at a fancy hotel, he runs into the one person in the world who is different: Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Shy and scarred (literally), she idolizes Stone, a fan of his book. The two end up spending the night together. First and foremost, I must say that the animation here is outstanding. The expressions of the characters in particular are fantastic. The film as a whole is, well, quite interesting, as you might expect from Kaufman. I'm not quite sure that, in the end, it has all that much depth. To me, the whole point seems to be simply that Michael Stone is a gigantic prick (thankfully the film doesn't end with this irredeemable loser). I also feel like the film is at its worst when Kaufman gets too Kaufmenesque, like Stone coming to realize that, oh my God, he's actually a puppet! It's a fine achievement, and I liked it a lot. I wish I kind of liked it a bit more, though."
102,Anomalisa,6,8 January 2016,"Certainly an Anomaly, but not much more","6 of 10. In what has been an off year for quality cartoon/animation films, Anomalisa does stand out, but not enough to even be the best in such an unremarkable year as 2015.It definitely has its impressive moments, but not so many or so consistently as to make it the film that some people clearly love. It also isn't so bad as to be worth the hate it seems to stir up. It is, instead, like the characters, a far more average film.I imagine that one of the annoying aspects are the voices. It initially seems as if you're watching a very low budget cartoon able to afford only a few second-rate voice actors. But the voices do have their place and eventually turn into one of the more enjoyable aspects.Unless there's a cartoon lingering out their awaiting its release near Oscar time, there really should be no award this year and none nominated or recognized in any way. Minions and Ghost in the Shell were both solid and Inside Out almost appears like genius at this point, but these are not award deserving cartoons (much like Frozen). My advice: don't grade on a curve - make a statement and demand better."
103,Anomalisa,10,30 December 2015,A Masterful Animated Masterpiece,"Since it came out in May, Mad Max: Fury Road has been my pick for best film of 2015. But now, after having seen Charlie Kaufman's Anomalisa mere days before the New Year, I find myself conflicted. Much like Fury Road, Kaufman's first feature in seven years is a stunning, singular achievement. That's where the similarities end. Anomalisa is a much more human film, and the irony of it is that it is both a stop- motion animation and was created entirely with puppets.The film follows Michael Stone (David Thewlis), a middle-age man known in the customer service world for a best-selling book. On a business trip, he encounters Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and experiences emotions that he hasn't felt in years. That's as much as I'll say. Anomalisa is not a film to be watched, but a film to be experienced. Thewlis and Leigh deliver some of the best work of the year as the two voices behind the principal puppets. The amount of raw emotion contained in their conversations makes it so that we forget that we are indeed watching lifeless figures. Both Thewlis and Leigh's performances honestly merit Oscar consideration, as does the film itself. In my mind, Anomalisa has supplanted Inside Out as the best animated film of 2015.Also perfect is Kaufman's screenplay, which is adapted from his own play of the same title. Over the course of the film's short 90 minute runtime, Kaufman makes it his mission to explore the human condition and he succeeds marvelously. Kaufman makes it so that in one scene we may find ourselves laughing and in the next, we may find ourselves close to tears. Anomalisa is a weird, peculiar film in a general sense, with hints of the surreal. And yet it works because of how touching Kaufman makes his tale. The story is heartfelt and melancholic, uplifting and crushing, but most of all, beautiful. The themes that develop throughout the film are complex, and yet something that every human can relate to. We forget that we are all members of the same species, who have experienced similar things that have made us feel similar ways, and the film makes us remember this fact.By delving into such themes as loneliness and the need to connect, the film becomes so much more. The film connects with the heart and soul, and makes for an engaging and gorgeous trip throughout. And speaking of gorgeous, it's the word that I would choose to describe Anomalisa's stop-motion animation. I absolutely adore the medium of stop-motion, and I find it criminally underutilized. However Kaufman and his co-director Duke Johnson expertly bring the various puppets from their tale to life. The film's direction is beautiful and each puppet moves naturally and smoothly. And between the puppets, each of their various interactions and conversations is framed and filmed beautifully. In addition, Carter Burwell's subdued score also adds to film's emotional heft and makes for a worthy companion.I feel like there's so much more I want to write about Anomalisa that I simply cannot. Firstly, I don't wish to spoil the film by talking any more about its plot. But perhaps most importantly is the fact that the film left me at a loss for words. I want to talk endlessly about it, but at the same time, I simply wish for more people to experience it on their own. I pride myself on not crying during films, but at the very least, Anomalisa came pretty damn close to making me do so. All in all, Anomalisa is a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2015, on the strength of its incredible direction and screenplay, stunning animation, amazing performances, and stirring emotional depth. I cannot recommend it enough, to everyone from the indie film enthusiast to the general moviegoer. Anomalisa made me think more than I ever would have imagined about what it means to be a human, and what it means to be alive.10/10"
104,Anomalisa,9,25 March 2016,A beautiful depiction of human connections,"Anomalisa is different to any other animation film I have ever seen, yet it feels all to familiar due to the realism it brings. It tackles questions about human connections and how they can change due to emotional indifferences. It's uniqueness on approaching said questions is very refreshing, as well as the smart use of subtle humour that really drew me towards the two lead characters, especially Michael (whom the movie is centered around). The clever use of metaphors helps you to gain a deeper understanding of how Michael feels and why he feels the way he does at certain points. Because of this I was emotionally invested in what is essentially a sad film with humorous tones planted throughout. Although I was skeptical about the look and feel of Anomalisa during the first 5 to 10 minutes due to the stop motion animation, once I had become accustomed to it and realised the true beauty of it, I was completely on board with the film till the very end. I would highly recommend watching Anomalisa and would definitely say it is an experience I enjoyed and am not likely to forget for a long time."
105,Anomalisa,10,30 December 2015,Charlie Kaufman and puppets have finally come full circle.,"Out of all the movies that I've seen this year, this one felt the most deeply personal to me. It conveys so much in such a simple way. As someone who is suffering from their own share of existential crises, it made a lot of sense. I wonder, does everyone feel this way? What do other people get out of this movie? I can't see it appealing to the majority of people. There's one scene in which he's looking into the mirror and he starts to see the cracks in his face and it almost feels like he's on the verge of discovering some existential truth about his reality (almost breaking the fourth wall)...it's really quite astounding. In terms of comparing it to Kaufman's other work, it's nowhere near the scope of Synecdoche, New York, but it feels like a pared down, simplified version of that story. There's a cast of three: the guy, the girl, and everyone else (played by the same actor using the same voice). The animation is stop-motion, but it feels so naturalistic, I can't explain it. There's plenty of adult themes but that's because it's a mature, adult movie. I wish more people would see it so I could feel like I relate to someone."
106,Anomalisa,10,31 December 2015,Final review of 2015,"Michael Stone: ""I think you're extraordinary"".Lisa: ""Why?"".Michael Stone: ""I don't know yet. It's just obvious to me that you are"".Anomalisa is about a depressed customer service rep faces the mundanity of his life and one day finds someone he can finally connect with.What a better way to end the year is to talk about ""Anomalisa"", one of my most anticipated movie of 2015. Charlie Kaufman is an inspiration, as a writer and now a director. Synecdoche, New York is one of my all time favorite movies, and yeah it's for everyone, but I personally loved it as with every repeat viewings of the movie made my love each more. Now we've got Anomalisa, Kaufman's new film and I did have the pleasure of watching the movie last night, I thought it was freaking fantastic. He did it again everyone.What really surprised me is how Anomalisa is the least complicated film by Charlie Kaufman, I mean Synecdoche, New York was very complicated and really needed Analyzing with repeat viewings just to get a gasp on what's happening, but here it's not that complicated. But the movie has a lot of clever and excellent choices that makes this movie just as unique as it is, I mean since we live in a age that every movie is the same, this movie stands out from the rest and it's execution was better than most of the animated movies I've seen this year.Duke Johnson and Charlie Kaufman are the main directors of this movie, and both of them have created one marvel of a film. Both of them mixed humor and seriousness together perfectly well. Duke Johnson is best known for working on TV shows such as: Moral Orel, Mary Shelley's Frankenhole, and Community. So yeah, ""Anomalisa"" is Duke Johnson's first feature length film and I thought he did a brilliant job on this movie, as he worked well with Charlie.Another thing I have to praise is the animation as it is freaking flawless. The movie is in stop motion and it's seriously impressive. When are main character goes through doors into different rooms and hall ways it was handled marvelously, because it makes this universe that the movie is set in feel real. The voice acting and the character designs made these characters feel like real people. Oh and how can I not talk about the characters eyes in this movie, as it was more realistic and impressive than any other animated movie I've seen this year. ""The most human movie of the year. And it doesn't star a single human"". - From Matt patches Overall Anomalisa is one of the best animated movies of 2015. It's way better than ""Inside Out"" (In my opinion). Charlie Kaufman has done it again everyone and it's glorious."
107,Anomalisa,7,25 February 2016,7.5/10,"Charlie Kaufman is back, as surreal and challenging as ever. ""Anomalisa"" is a fascinating and unique film that has an enormous number of points of inspiration and discussion that engage the viewer deeply into the narrative, even though I am not sure how much they pay off.I found this film to have everything I always said about Kaufman, both the great and the disappointing. As always his characters are thrown into a surreal situation that is used as a storytelling mean and, as always, the hook works perfectly. Your attention is captured in the first fifteen minutes and it manages to be kept very high. With the help of some truly brilliant sound design the animation is incredibly fascinating. I must admit it took me five or ten minutes to get on tune with it, but as soon as I did I marveled at what was going on with it. It is used to perfection, I thought that there would not have been a better way to tell this story if not through this medium and the fact that they did it so is a stroke of genius.The thematics that emerge through the first two acts are spell binding. They are treated with immense delicacy and subtleness and again, thanks to the particular use of animation, the filmmakers achieve something that couldn't have been done with live action. It is really hard to get into detail both because of spoilers, but even more so because of the complexity of what they manage to achieve. The whole second act resonates in such a unique and pleasantly weird way I am still trying to get my thoughts straight on it. That is of course a common element with all of Kaufan's films, there is always the need for a very long time and at least a couple re-watches to even start grasping some of the stuff that is going on. And I must admit, it sometimes becomes alienating, but not here, on the contrary the whole surrealism and mysterious vibe is what makes the film the most interesting.Yet, I found the third act to go, as I have always have with Kaufman, totally opposite direction of the first two. Now, I really do get what he is trying to do and I also understand why it works for so many people. I just thinks that he has a tendency to undermine everything he has done in the first two acts with his third one. It always seems to go in a totally different place and I am always left wandering: ""but what about those themes?"". What I am trying to say is that as much as I love his work and look forward to every single one of his projects, I don't ever seem to get an emotional pay off. I always end up leaving the theater wanting more. ""Anomalisa"" is no exception. I was having a blast up until the last twenty minutes where it started derailing and it started becoming unreadable. I believe that it gets a little too complicated for its own good and ends up not making much of a point, when it could have by simply sticking to its guns.Reviewing a Kaufman films is always very difficult because it is almost impossible to recollect your thoughts so quickly, it requires many days to be digested and that speaks to why his films are always so interesting to watch even though I still have a hard time in getting surprised and moved by them."
108,Anomalisa,,30 December 2015,"Deeply melancholic, atmospheric, and nuanced. Kaufman's best work to date.","I definitely don't think it's a stretch to possibly call this film Kaufman's best work to date. It only has Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as a viable contender. It may also be his saddest work to date, with its deep melancholy permeating the screen every second of the film. Having never seen any trailers for the film, I can say that the stop-motion animation is exquisite. The film from the start feels like a realistic dream. Things make sense, but not completely. Things feel realistic, yet also a little off (and this isn't accounting for the primary narrative decision regarding the characters' voices). The decision to not make this live-action was the only right choice for this story, and it works wonders. The directorial control of the atmosphere is powerful and long- lasting in its effect. It's definitely a more ""simple"" film than his last few films, but it hits just as hard and I also think there are less rough patches because of that. Something close to a masterpiece. I also want to mention that between this and The Hateful Eight, Jennifer Jason Leigh deserves two Oscar nominations. I had no idea that was her behind the character of Lisa, and it's such an insane, almost impossible contrast to her brutal, cruel work in The Hateful Eight. She's had an incredible year."
109,Anomalisa,6,15 May 2016,Anomaly; exception to the rule,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.You go to a puppet show. You think it is a ordinary puppet show. Then it starts and blast you away with its ordinary every day feeling of a man struggling in his own intense way to survive his world of success and boredom.The story behind this one is so faceted in so many ways it almost becomes frustrating. It comes natural that Duke Johnson and Charlie Kaufman hit it big with this motion picture. Michael Stone (David Thewlis) has his mind to struggle against the whole time. Is he on the verge of becoming insane, or is he just over worked and stressed out of the family situation? Or is he insane on the verge of becoming sane? Maybe he is successful and having a hard time accepting that, or having a bad conscience for leaving his family for work? Maybe he is in such boredom in the marriage, both sexually and socially, that he having fantasies about all kinds of sexual exploitation's.The way that the director and the writer convey this little masterpiece is straight forward, honest and genuine. The longing for love and acceptance is one of human kinds biggest struggles. Anomalisa is hitting that topic bulls-eye.To create something simple and easy going out of a tough topic is great. Doing that and getting people feel for the characters made out of puppets is just excellent.On the downside, I have to say the movie itself were a little bit boring and odd. The enormous ""part of odd"" I am very convinced the production team behind the film were very much aware of.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Extraordinary excellent production.... as this is a animated movie.... made with puppets. Academy Award nominee. - The actors : Very good... David Thewlis grasps the social disturbances and the mental dissatisfaction of the main character. - The story : So complex as it is faceted. - Entertainment : Like watching a big and ordinary puppet show.... that comes with Academy Award nomination. - Age : 15, due to sexual content and language.6,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)"
110,Anomalisa,7,7 April 2016,Anomalisa,"This animated comedy/drama follows Michael Stone who is a customer service specialist. Stuck in a mundane routine, Michael finds little enjoyment from life.Voiced by David Thewlis, Michael's persona is what makes the film, in fact the slow dry lingering pace of the dialogue and humour is what sets this film apart from other animated comedy's.The film does however get slightly strange when it appears Michael has a disorder that makes him see all people as looking the same. There was an eerie almost horrifying few minutes that turned the film on it's head and had my eyes glued to the screen.All in all the film is ground breaking in its genre and one that I hope will inspire similar films in coming years."
111,Anomalisa,9,12 March 2016,"one of the most beautiful, heartfelt, human pieces of cinematic art i have ever seen.. with no actual humans","Anomalisa, this film itself is a bit of an anomaly. Something that could have easily been done with two live actors is translated perfectly into a stop motion animation that looks and feels so wonderful. I swear halfway through i forgot i was even watching an animated film, i was so enthralled and mesmerised by what was going on in the film itself and it really is something that begs to be seen to be believed.The film follows Michael Stone, who is such an interesting and complex character to begin with. He is voiced wonderfully by David Thewlis who gives this character such raw emotion and throughout this character is unpredictable. He sees everyone as looking and sounding the same (Tom Noonan voices all secondary characters in a creepy yet mesmerising fashion) and is fed up with his mundane life as he is lonely and depressed. He then meets Lisa who is incredibly different to him, voiced again perfectly by Jennifer Jason Leigh. He believes Lisa is the person to turn his life around and she is seemingly perfect to him, but by the end there is a shocking revelation but i won't spoil this for you.Animated films are a great way to show raw emotion from a character, but never has it been done so perfectly. These characters are flawed and have deep desires and when they meet each other you feel nothing could be more perfect. I won't lie though by the end i was looking at my own life and thinking about all the flaws etc. I have because Charlie Kaufman is just so good at doing this. The relationship between the two characters are like a cross between Lost in Translation and Eternal Sunshine, the latter because at times this film gets VERY surreal. As a result, this film won't be for everyone, but it really helped me to connect to it. You will walk out wondering what is real, or what is a depression induced nightmare. But at the same time it is bittersweet, you look back and feel pretty good about this film but then you think to the core of it and it makes you sad you even thought that. So at the end of it all, it is an interesting Marvel to behold. Please, see this film. It won't be out for long. Don't let a hard R animation put you off.. because yeah this film gets graphic and has probably the most realistic sex scene I've seen in forever. But i really hope people go to see this one, it won't be out for long, but like Lost in Translation i feel that Anomalisa deserves to be called a modern masterpiece. I hope it garners a cult following in years to come, because it would be much deserved."
112,Anomalisa,7,6 March 2016,Interesting way to express a man's journey through a mundane existence,"So I get the plot. The main character Micheal is not happy with how plan and dull his life is, and he uses a business trip to try to change that. He succeeds when he meets Lisa who gives him a spark of life.I did not truly get the movie until I watched it again, However. When I saw it the first time, I was impressed by the animation but found the story boring, so it did take me another turn around to understand how the animation the voice acting and the story all work together.It's very brilliant and so Charlie Kaufman who co-directed and wrote the film. It seems out of the nowhere to use animation for this, but it actually makes perfect since in showing us how the lead character Micheal Stone feels about life.One of the best uses of film animation I've seen."
113,Anomalisa,8,6 February 2016,A triumph of artistic cinema,"Charlie Kaufman's stop-motion animation is a beautifully simple, honest film about the paralyzing fear that comes with aging. Anomalisa feels like a theatre play, claustrophobically confined within several interiors and a plethora of raw emotions. Truly a triumph of artistic cinema.Michael Stone (David Thewlis) is a writer and a consumer service specialist. He's also a sarcastic, older man, who leads an obnoxiously boring life. During his journey to Cincinnati, where he's supposed to discuss his latest book, he meets Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) Â– an ordinary woman, in which quite surprisingly, he sees a cure for the depression that devours him.Kaufman's power in Anomalisa relies mainly on the peculiar ""mannerism"" of the dialogues Â– they sound uncomfortable, almost artificial on the surface, but after giving them a second thought, they are very truthful and depressing. The director doesn't seek straight lines neither in his characters nor his philosophy, weaving everything with brutal sarcasm and intricacy. Hence, Anomalisa's protagonist Â– Michael, is a complex character, devastated by the mundanity of his existence by digging in his past Â– that is why he contacts his former lover, Bella, once he reaches Cincinatti. His consciousness is then torn apart by Lisa, whom Michael uses as a tool, treating her as a catalyst of changes he needs.Therefore, Kaufman emphasizes that Michael Stone's depression, this constant kneeling before routine, is much more complicated than it looks. On one hand, it's the past haunting him, idealized as a once- lost escape from this everyday nightmare he perceives. On the other, Kaufman points out the bitterness, which Michael beams with, casting it upon just-met Lisa. Stone appears to be a warning for us Â– a man, whose life slipped through his fingers, miserably flicking through the pages of his life as if it was a book. Finally, Kaufman tricks us with an illusion of a catharsis that Michael goes through, thoroughly built- up just to break in the very last scene of the film. He has no mercy over Michael Â– the past, the presence both cast a long shadow on Michael's heart-breakingly sad future.The philosophical aspect is finely leveraged by voice acting. First of all, David Thewlis' and Jennifer Jason Leigh's performances are both intimate and beautifully real Â– they really constitute a genuinely peculiar and charming duo. It is their interpretation, which causes Kaufman's dialogues sound natural too. What's more, there are some intriguing elements, brilliantly emerging in the film, which cause Anomalisa to be even more of a peculiarly lovely experience. As an example, Michael stays in a hotel named Fregoli, which is an analogy to the Fregoli syndrome Â– a sickness in which the ill individual sees a disguised person in multiple people surrounding him. Kaufman refers to this by voicing every single character in the film Â– obviously apart from Michael and Lisa Â– with Tom Noonan's calming tone.Charlie Kaufman's well-deserved recognition got a huge boost from Anomalisa Â– a truly hypnotizing drama, a bit depressing, charming and thought-provoking. It surely constitutes a fraction of what modern cinema is vastly missing nowadays Â– a look at how fast our lives go and how little do we actually grab for ourselves."
114,Anomalisa,7,7 February 2016,Sometimes the lesson is there is always a lesson,"Charlie Kaufman is smarter than the rest of us, so it's difficult to write a review of his work without proving it by missing the point completely. But with Anomalisa Charlie is holding our hand. He tells us that sometimes 'the lesson is there is no lesson'. But it's difficult to believe that he is genuine as he feels like the type of guy who makes a point even when he's trying not to. This story seems straightforward. We join Michael (David Thewlis) on a plane and travel with him to a Cincinnati Hotel. Every agonising detail is covered. Most films don't allow the time to follow a character into the bathroom or have them say ""pardon"" when they didn't quite hear what another character said. Anomalisa does. We are on this journey. We are in that cab, we've had that cab driver and we've had that hotel shower with erratic temperature control. Hotel rooms can become constrictive when you are alone. Those four enclosed walls and ceiling can sometimes push you back into yourself, but Michael reaches out. He calls an old girlfriend, but he acts odd and ruins any chance to re-establish their old connection. He hints at psychological problems but doesn't articulate what they are. We can take a guess.Michael is staying in the Fregoli Hotel, in an overt nod to the Fregoli Delusion, where sufferer's mistakenly believe that every individual they are in contact with is the same person. This manifests itself for Michael as every voice that he hears sounding the same (all voiced by Tom Noonan). It adds a monotone to the already mundane and it causes him to disconnect from his life. To him, his wife and son sound the same and they sound no different to strangers. Everything has lost it's meaning, until he hears a new voice in the hallway (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and he comes alive. Have I mentioned yet that these are puppets?Kaufmann has played with puppets before. In Being John Malkovich , puppets were used to display the inner sadness that John Cusack's character couldn't verbalise. In Anomalisa, Kaufman has removed the actor layer completely and with co-director Duke Johnson has created a stop-motion masterpiece that is both technical brilliant and emotionally effecting. We are used to seeing this type of animation used for laughs, but this plays it dead straight and confrontingly real. These puppets are anatomically correct and no detail of craftsmanship goes unseen. This is Wallace and Gromit After Dark.Michael tells us that everything is ""boring"" and Kauffman treads a fine line in having the audience share that feeling, without being turned off by it. But it does feel necessary to understand what Michael is going through and it challenges us to decide if we sympathise with him or are appalled. Part of that choice will depend on whether you think we see this world as it is, or as Michael sees it.Anomalisa leaves you with a lot of questions. Is this Kaufman reflecting on the modern homogenised consumer society or is he projecting his dissatisfaction with the sameness of his own life? Is he saying we are all puppets or is he hinting that Michael thinks he might be a robot doomed to continue along the assembly line of life? You'll have to draw your own conclusions, which is probably the whole point anyway."
115,Anomalisa,8,18 January 2016,"Each person you speak to has had a day, some other days have been good, some bad.","Anomalisa marks Kaufman's second directorial work and it is definitely his most personal, sensitive and honest movie to date. In the sad, watery eyes of Michael Stone everyone will find something that they can deeply relate to, regardless of the age. It is this border, this invisible line per se, between having a movie that is a touch too personal but at the same time so simple and relatable, that makes Anomalisa a truly unique piece.'Lisa' is made entirely of stop motion animation, which greatly adds to the blurry and human aspects of Kauffman's story. This style paints the events in a very surreal, dream like way, which surprisingly makes us appreciate and admire the 'grown-up' moments of this story so much more. Sometimes the animations simply make the movie seem less depressive as we get entangled in scenes that otherwise would have had less value and impact. Imagine If Anomalisa was a motion picture - it would have been the most unbearably sad movie ever made.Charlie Kaufman's 'Michael Stone' is a man that is seemingly crippled by his prior life experiences. Not so much as crippled, but these experiences have made him lonely, hopeless and tired. It seems that Michael is on a verge of literally giving up. Everything seems like a drag in his life, people bore and annoy him, everyone literally looks and sounds the same. Michael is smart, but also inherently paranoid, and this paranoia, these sets of self-conscious beliefs, is what seems to be dragging him down. He seems to constantly try to get back to something that he thought was true. We see his excitement when he calls Bella, his ex-girlfriend that he ran away from, only to see that excitement completely destroyed when faced with the reality's of life.Michael has a family back home, a wife and a son that love him and need him. Even so, at this stage in life it seems that he is ready to take anything for granted in order to find 'true happiness and meaning'. It is a funny parallel where a happiness of one man somehow ends up being more important then of the ones around him. We all go full circles before we realize and make piece with the inevitable. Through meeting Lisa, Michael seemed to yet again experience the sad anomaly of life, where 'the one', was so close that you could 'hear' her, yet so far away that it's unreachable.Anomalisa in this sentimental sense is a very human film. We all takes love and loving ones for granted at times, we are paranoid, we disregards the feelings of others and we all have an unrealistic perception of ourselves. At the same time, everyone is human and no one is left un-impacted. Through our mindless actions, we impact others, even if we sometimes forget about it. Charlie Kaufman has managed to take a script that is truly sad and depressive and show it through a compassionate, sympathetic and approachable lens, where every viewer is bound to derive their own conclusions. Like all of us, Michael Stone thinks he knows what he wants, but time after time, he runs away at the sheer possibility of actually getting it."
116,Anomalisa,6,4 January 2016,"Each person you speak to has had a day, some other days have been good, some bad.","I decided to watch Anomalisa when I watched the trailer for the first time,""Each person you speak to has had a day, some other days have been good, some bad."" This line sold me, as I would re-watch this trailer again and again for this line that I saw so fitting to the overall depressing theme but the thing is that what David Thewlis' Michael Stone says is just so true and to the heart. So here I was very excited for the movie as I was about to watch it and the thing is it isn't exactly the philosophical masterpiece that I had expected but instead this subtle peace about loneliness and an overall depressing film. However that is what I like most about Anomalisa, the tone of it all is perfect for the message on loneliness that I believe Charlie Kaufman was trying to achieve.However it is obviously flawed too, personally I think that if it did take the path of depicting humanity in everyday activities and behavior and repetition if would make a great movie. It really didn't have to transfer into this bizarre sexual fantasy with strange plot twists that don't really make much sense. However that would be a whole other thing much unlike what this movie has passed itself on as. The thing is the movie itself I think is alright but the decision to advertise it a s some philosophical masterpiece is a big problem, it sends out a false message of what it is going to be about and fails to paint an overall picture of what the movie would actually be like and is in fact quite deceiving.And I haven't even mentioned the amazing stop motion, as it says on the poster, ""The most human film of the year"" I quite agree on that. Overall it is a heartwarming film with several strange turns of events but overall manages to land perfectly after all."
117,Anomalisa,5,25 December 2016,Incredibly boring and dull.,"I'm not a fan of fast-action films, but this film is quite unentertaining. Every scene is a chore to go through. It reminds me a little of Lost in Translation, but it's not nearly as entertaining. Everything is slow and pointless. The taxi ride was too long, the fact the people don't understand basic things like ""yes"" or ""no"" in a foreign accent is absurd, especially for a cabbie, one that does the airport route to add.There are random absurdist things like the phone having multiple stickers for food. There's no point to that whatsoever. It's not funny enough to make the scene entertaining, not crazy enough to be absurdist, not interesting enough to make any sort of point whatsoever.There are too many scenes that don't need to be there. Ordering room service adds nothing to the story, but fine, the room service suggests desserts and drinks (which are interrupted), fine, but when the room service repeats the entire menu, ingredients, details, etc. you start to wonder if there's any significance to it.There are films that are about loneliness and isolation, where people cherish these small impersonal moments of human interaction, but this wasn't one. Michael isn't interested in suggestions for desserts, he's not interested in the cabbie's suggestions, so it's just annoying to have to endure this.The animation was well done, but this feels like a short stretched out to make a feature film.There's also no reason to have one person do many voices. Voice acting is not expensive and even the crappiest Pixar/Disney rip-off films have a voice for every character.I won't watch it again nor recommend it to anyone other than to animation students as an example of great animation."
118,Anomalisa,6,18 April 2016,Didn't get off the runway,"Bottom line. Just didn't work. Spoiler alert Â– I thought at first the main character was married to a guy or a wife with a really deep voice. Then find all the women talk like men. Why? Filp - this is hard work Â– just entertain me. OK the main character is bored with his marriage Â– seven year itch sort of thing? Is that it? - And everyone sounds the same to him. Then he hears a voice that cries out to him Â– different. I still cared at this point. Not for much longer though. I didn't get the reference to Fregoli Â– a rare mental disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person. Obviously a bit lacking in my education there. I think I may have been off school when they taught us about that. I think I was suffering from Capgras syndrome that day or it may have been a heavy cold, though I don't really see a difference in illnesses. I actually don't like to Analise films. They either work or they don't. If I can compare this to another Claymation film (Why? Â– Why not!) - Mary and Max was a roller- coaster ride. This then would be like sitting down at the start of a roller-coaster with great expectation and buckling up Â– then a while later the guy says Â– OK Â– take your belts off - that's it. But nothing Happened !!! Whadya mean nothing happened Â– you saw two clay people having sex didn't you. Yeh that's true Â– OK you get a star for that."
119,Anomalisa,6,10 April 2016,"Sweet, Sad, but...","I really don't like animated movies, but Charlie Kaufman drew me to this one. The animation was excellent, first off. The story and it's characters were sweet, sad, and emotional. Kaufman's idea that every voice in the protagonist's world is exactly the same, with the exception of Anomalisa's, is genius. Carter Burwell, the man behind some of the most amazing film scores of the past 20 years, didn't fail to impress here. He's done all of the Coen Brothers' films and should have several Oscars under his belt by now, not just one nomination ever. Now the bad stuff. I can't decide if the stop-motion, Claymation-figurine sex (oral and otherwise) was funny, gross, stupid, gratuitous or just plain silly. I think it was a little of everything. I'm not a prude - it was just disturbing, that's all. And, ultimately, this movie was just a cartoon."
120,Anomalisa,8,29 March 2016,"Brutal, honest, beautiful","I just saw this movie, and I'm not a person who writes reviews, but this movie is different. This movie is definitely the most human film of the year, like the poster says. It's both beautiful and sad, but the sad thing about it is that it makes you feel like you are Michael, not because of a sad scene, not because an old lady dies, not because Marley the dog died from Marley &Me, you know you were teary or cried, but it's because it's honesty. It makes you feel the alienation, the loneliness, the dullness of life, the depression and it makes you empathize with Michael, because we all go through that in this century. We all want to have a voice when only some people actually can, and we all look for that unique voice of someone to change everything, that one savior. And I'm not saying it has to be romantically, it can be politically, socially, about anything. And even though the idea of this movie is 11 years old, it's not aged. If 11 years changed something, it only made it worse. This movie has the most engaging storytelling since the late Robin Williams' (RIP) movies. It has it's own voice like Lisa's and it definitely accomplished what Kaufman tried to do, it makes us feel human again around these live-action movies where we only see superpowers and James Bonds. We forget who we actually are and it makes us think about ourselves and our relationships."
121,Anomalisa,8,27 December 2017,More human than you might expect,"I knew very little about this film: Charlie Kaufman, animated...that was about it. Interestingly enough, it was one of the more human films that I've seen lately. Even though the characters were created from 3D printers. I could not look away, and I found each little moment to be intriguing and poignant. It was not a perfect piece - more play than movie, a bit light on plot - bit it was worth seeing (and revisiting), for sure."
122,Anomalisa,7,23 December 2017,Insightful writing and oversimplified (if expert) animation,"Anomalisa (2015) I was drawn to this because of the great writer, Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine, Being John Malkovich). Here was a story about an ordinary man who goes to Ohio (an ordinary place) on travel and things go very slightly strange.
 The fact this is an animated film took me by surprise. And I stayed with it, wondering over and over how it helped to have it animated. Here is a story about a subtle psychological crisis, and the real reactions and facial expressions of the main character (and others) seemed to me to be totally important. And here they were dumbed down to archetypes and simplifications. Oh, I know, the animators tried for subtlety but I'm not going to praise a film for being ""really close"" to the actual thing. Not with the actual thing would be better.
 However, there are elements to the film that eventually seem to require animation (though even this isn't convincing, I'll say right away). For one thing, nearly everyone's voice is the same kind of ordinary man's voice, even women. That might have been handled with dubbing. Then there are some cracks in the facade of realism that rely on animation, like people's faces have seams (or in one case coming apart). I think there might be ways to do this otherwise, but it's fine animated, too.
 But wait-what about this writing that I was so drawn to? Well, it's good. It's like seeing a lesser David Mamet play, knowing it's good but knowing there are some really amazing examples elsewhere. So I watched and listened and the crisis, which is of the most ordinary kind, unfolds and turns out to be something unfinished and unsatisfying.
 So, lots of hesitations here. A film with great potential. And maybe people who prefer (!) the nature of detached observation that the animation forces on is, and the style of it all, might get deeper in than I could."
123,Anomalisa,9,21 December 2017,"Looks great, is great.","Very realistic, almost depressing. Good animation, liked the cinematography, yet I don't like the idea of watching it again."
124,Anomalisa,1,11 November 2017,A very bad movie,"I am not a en expert, but I honestly found this clip a total waste of my time. Senseless things, not recommended. If you are the kind of people that expects a movie to give you something, laugh, sex, fun, anything, you just won't get it from this one. Not at all. It really took time from my life and gave nothing back, this one has nothing for real."
125,Anomalisa,10,19 October 2017,"Only the voice you love is ""different""","Many people couldn't stand the voice of this movie, for it's been so monotone and doesn't match the characters at all. However, it's a genius sacrifice to express the theme and I'm sure many people were touched by this extraordinary work. ..........Spoiler: My friends and I have split views on whether Lisa ever exists or not..........The fissures on the Japanese doll could be a symbol of Lisa's scar..........So there are two ways to interpret the movie, either way is sad, he cannot hear the ""right"" voice anymore."
126,Anomalisa,9,6 September 2017,Another Kaufman masterpiece,"While an adult stop-motion drama about a midlife crisis and mental illness may sound mundane as a concept, this is quite possibly Kaufman's sharpest and most absorbing film yet. Charlie Kaufman has already proved himself to be one of the smartest, most creative visionary directors/writers working today. He has yet to make an unoriginal film even as his vibrant style stretches over a career spanning 40 years. Anomalisa is certainly Kaufman's tamest work when compared to the outlandish concepts of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, but it is also one of his most engaging. A grounded perception of mental illness affecting a lonely, middle-aged man in the centre of a richly-detailed, yet maddening, world. The concept will never sound as appealing as it really is, but upon viewing, the film's subtle messages on love and identity will surely resonate with any viewer, no matter their age. Even with an ending that hints upon a concept that I wish was further explored, Anomalisa expresses it's thought-provoking story through detailed character interactions, a wry script and brilliant voice performances from the extremely limited cast that had me daydreaming of the film's beauty long after watching."
127,Anomalisa,10,2 September 2017,For anyone who feels empty inside...,"Suitably nihilistic for Kaufman but with a much more straightforward presentation than his other films and therefore more accessible to a more casual audience.Tha animation is some of the best I have ever witnessed.Its a story of loneliness, despite being surrounded by people, and personal depression which will resonate with anyone who has ever felt an emptiness inside them."
128,Anomalisa,8,31 August 2017,Intellectually stimulating and a pleasure for your eyes and ears,"I'd go that far as too say that ANOMALISA is almost as dense and multi layered as the E.T.A. Hoffmann classical story DER SANDMANN, also including the puppet as a major metaphorical figure, the one Sigmund Freud used to explain the Uncanny in his prominent essay. The film can be read as a story about individuality and individualism in our times and/or about a mean psychosis coming alive and/or male and female sexual longings and/or a typical mid-life crisis of a semi-famous man realizing how detached he feels to his entire life and/or a desperate, sincere prayer to a God perceived as the ultimate puppet master doubled in the puppets within the story and double doubled within the dreams of the puppets within the story etc. ANOMALISA is surely a complex little film, but luckily at the same time told very straight forwardly and laid back, almost relaxed, which makes it easy to watch it through Â— and just beautifully animated from the puppet faces to the lightning choreographies within the virtual, shoe-box like spaces. Sometimes it is funny and sometimes dramatically sad, often it is both at the same time. Almost always it is intellectually stimulating and a pleasure for your eyes and ears."
129,Anomalisa,9,17 August 2017,Beautifully and hauntingly real,"In my reviews, I usually critique and obsess over story-line, cinematography, production design, and acting. And although I have good things to say about the voice acting and the beautiful (and to be honest, quite haunting) stop-motion, this review will be my anomaly. Because the characters in this movie deserve their own standing ovation. I watched Anomalisa not knowing what to expect, having never seen anything written by Charlie Kaufman before (I apologize to the hardcore Kaufman fans, but I promise after Anomalisa, it'll be hard to keep me away).And so I sat there while the movie folded out in front of me--It was so simple. Yet the entire time, I was taken aback at how REAL the characters were. Every little thing they said, every little thing they did, and every little thing they went through, I found it so easy to sympathize and relate to these characters who, just minutes before the movie started, had meant absolutely nothing to me. And for me, that was magical.I usually fall in love with the story of a movie. But here, the characters WERE the story. And they really weren't that special at all. But that's what made them the most beautiful."
130,Anomalisa,6,26 July 2017,I have been thinking about it for a week now,"Despite me watching 5 airing TV series and 2 completed ones, seeing 3 movies and played one story-driven video game, I am still thinking about Anomalisa week after seeing it and all this other stuff. Keeping the rating at 5/10 has been an uncertainty for me, but I have now decided to call it a 6/10 work. Anomalisa is definitely thought-provoking, unique and even memorable experience. The execution is very different from anything that's been done before. It feels heavy on substance even though it rides with the power of a single sentence. Some would go as far as calling this a masterpiece. Some think it has nothing to offer. Should have been 40 minutes long short film instead. I will just say this: is not necessarily a must watch, but it is a must try."
131,Anomalisa,,3 January 2016,Unique Look of Love and Loneliness,"Anomalisa (2015) **** (out of 4)A rather unique and extremely impressive animated movie from Charlie Kaufman centers on Michael Stone (David Thewlis), a British man living in Los Angeles who finds himself in Cincinnati to give a speech the following day. That night at the motel loneliness sits in and he tries to hook up with an old flame, which is a disaster but things take a turn for the better when he meets a fan (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and the two spend some time together.I hadn't read a single thing about this movie other than hearing that it was one of the years best films. I went in blind to what everything was about, which is probably the best way to view the film. I must admit that I was shocked at how caught up in the story I became but I think Kaufman really shows that a great screenplay can work whether it's live action or animation. I was really shocked at how this animated world felt like a live action movie and it's just something very realistic and heartfelt.ANOMALISA is basically about a troubled man who can't seem to keep his life in order when he gets to meet someone who herself feels ugly and not-so-special. What amazed me about the screenplay is how much character development there is here because we not only get to know both of these characters but we get to learn about how they ended up in their current situations as well as why they might not be able to escape them. The animation is really unlike anything I've seen before and I really thought Kaufman and Duke Johnson did a remarkable job at pulling you into this lonely world.Both David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh do a remarkable job with their vocal performances. It's strange but I keep saying how the animation feels real and like it was live action and the performances help make this a reality as well. Both of them are just so warm, tender and funny that you can't help but fall for their characters. Every other character is voiced by Tom Noonan who is also wonderful and really helps create the atmosphere and world we're watching.ANOMALISA is certainly a unique picture that I'm sure not everyone will enjoy. It's a thinking person's picture and Kaufman deserves a lot of credit for what he was able to do here."
132,Anomalisa,2,18 June 2016,Boring dreary puppet porn movie,"Ugh! This is a dreary animated kind of puppet people movie about someone who is unhappy with their life. Boring!!! There is a lot of cursing, some sex or what one might call Puppet Porn. We really do not need the puppets giving each other oral sex in a movie and then some crappy dialog on top of that. Personally watching the mashing machine turn laundry might be more appealing. I guess they added all the cursing to try to make the movie more realistic. But its simply dull, dull, dull and a waste of time. The characters are odd with women that have men's voices. Guess the budget was not enough to use the right voices. If you put this movie on fast forward it would still be boring but perhaps more watchable. If you want to see someone who hates his life to make you feel better about yours than this may be for you. If you are not a miserable person, look at any other movie. This movie is garbage!"
133,Anomalisa,8,9 February 2016,"Brilliant, I think.","As with many of Charlie Kaufman's films, it's hard to form an opinion on this movie after only seeing it once. While not as dense as Synechdoche, New York, nor as imaginative av Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - it's still a very unique movie. Most likely I will adjust my rating of this movie every time I see it.The animation and the technical aspect of the movie has gotten lots of praise, and it's all deserved. It's also appreciated that the animation was used for a reason, and that reason not being eye candy, or a necessity due to the content. Instead, it functions as an extra layer, an extension of the themes of the movie. That said, they also do play around with it, and try to make it as gorgeous (though not always pretty) as possible.Based on Kaufman's previous work, it's hard not to see this as personal movie, and see the Michael Stone character as some sort of reflection of Kaufman. Obviously he is not him, but watching Stone navigating praise and expectations from the other people in the hotel, and justifying his difficult emotions despite the love that surround him - these are human problems that you can have without being famous, and possible even more when you are.This movie made me think about depression, and while it might not be what Kaufman was going for (or maybe it was?), it must surely be in the same ball park. The Stone character can not get out of his own head, or face ""reality"". He knows how messed up his situation is, but sees no way out of it. What glimmer of hope he can find, he holds on to - but the solution to his problems is not something outside of him. Which is a truth that must be devastating to face.A last note: This is, amongst other things, a funny movie. Not from start to finish, and not every scene. But one of the tools in Kaufmans box is making you laugh despite the dark situation (instead of because of it)."
134,Anomalisa,8,25 January 2016,Charlie Kaufman Being Charlie Kaufman: another strange trip that's worth taking,"""Anomalisa"" (2015 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis). As the movie opens, we see Michael arriving from LA at the Cincinnati airport, as he's scheduled to give a presentation on customer service the next day. Michael checks in in his hotel in downtown Cincinnati, and after a disastrous rendez-vous at the hotel bar with his ex, Michael eventually makes the acquaintance of Lisa (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Emily, two women who drove down from Akron for his talk. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is the latest brainchild of Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich; Adaptation; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, etc.), and to state that he is pretty unique in the movie business would be an understatement. I'll go see anything that this guy comes up with, yes, he is that unique (and that good). Here, he takes yet another direction, spinning a story of a loner, and presenting it in stop-motion fashion. On top of that, other than the two main characters having their own unique voice, all the other characters, both make and female, are voiced by the same person (Tom Noonan). Even though the two settings couldn't be more different (Tokyo vs. Cincinnati), the movie made me think more than once about Sofia Coppola's ""Lost In Translation"" (including the themes of loneliness and self-doubt). Beware, even though this is stop-motion, there are several scenes with explicit nudity, so if that bothers you... Last but not least, there is a very nice orchestral score for this movie, courtesy of Carter Burwell. And then there is the a-cappela version of Cindy Lauper's ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" by the Lisa character...The movie opened last weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had a chance to see it this weekend. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not as well as I had expected. Given the multiple Cincinnati references in the film (down to Cincinnati chili), there were quite a few laughs and reactions from the audience during the showing. That aside, if you like Charlie Kaufman and all of the weirdness that entails (in the best possible way), you cannot go wrong with this. ""Anomalisa"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
135,Anomalisa,6,12 January 2016,Meh.  It's OK.,"I enjoyed the movie but do not understand why all these superlatives are being thrown around. I think sometimes praised is heaped upon movies simply because they are different than the usual, watered down scripts that are churned out repeatedly, regardless of whether or not they are any good.I did enjoy the animation. One of the subtleties of the film was the detail in the environments while the people themselves were all a bit off.Not so subtle was nearly all the characters having the same voice. I understand why it was done but I guess did not care for that particular device.So overall a good movie but by no means a great one for me. Maybe because I feel like a less successful version of the main character?"
136,Anomalisa,9,27 May 2016,Struggle to find reality,"A story of a person who struggles to find reality in his life mainly love.He is crippled by his loneliness and depression.He sees every person in this world like they are same .It is his inability to distinguish between two people. He is famous and he have written book on customer service. But one day when he has to do a speech at Cincinnati and met some different person at the hotel.They seems to fell in love because she is very much different than others. But after sometime she appears to be like everyone else so he left her and cant get along.This movie is little bit of intense.This movie contains spoilers.The animation is good.You may notice that every character from Taxi drivers to his wife has a same face and same voice (voice of a man) except himself,Lisa(the different girl) which describes that he is unable to distinguish between peoples."
137,Anomalisa,8,20 February 2016,One of the best animated movies I've seen in a while,"I was really excited to see this movie- I love Charlie Kauffman and it's been a really long time since an ""adult"" animated movie was nominated for best animated feature. I had heard amazing things about this movie, and for the most part I was not disappointed.From a purely technical perspective this movie is flawless, it doesn't even really look like claymation because all the details are so meticulously crafted. Each character looks like an individual and they all look distinctly human and life like. The choice to use one voice actor for most of the characters could've turned out to be a draw back, but I think it worked very well.The sound track was fantastic, in my opinion. The inclusion of ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" could have been corny or played off as comedic but I think it worked incredibly well for the tone of the film.The only issues I had with the movie were the sex scene and the fact that the theme could sometimes get a little muddled as the movie got sort of unfocused in some parts.re: the sex scene, I guess I just didn't see the point. It's extremely drawn out and the longer it goes on the more you get the feeling that the only reason it's included at all is to show off the construction of the figures (which is amazing, I agree). I almost feel like that whole part of the movie would've been more meaningful if they had done what the main character had suggested originally and just talked all night. It's one thing to have someone resent you after having had sex with them, but I think having him begin to resent her after having this (from Lisa's perspective) incredibly intimate and bonding night before would have been more conducive to the themes of the movie.Which brings me to my only other complaint, which is that the theme did tend to get sort of muddled near the middle-end. There were points in the movie where I wasn't particularly confident that Kauffman or the other director had anything at all to say at that time, so they just added stuff in and hoped someone else would find a good explanation for it. To their credit, I'm sure someone will.Regardless of my complaints, definitely one of the better movies I've seen this year."
138,Anomalisa,,25 January 2016,Really haved this movie (not very good),"I'm putting off on writing my review for this movie until after I've seen it, but for now, let me just say that it's not very good. For one it's animated. For two it's adult. Neither of these themes coalesce into a legitimate whole. When the film functions, it tries to display drama, or comedy. The problem is that the film doesn't make you cry either from crying or laughing, it just doesn't work.The film is made by a demented madman, paranoid schizophrenic named Charlie Kaufman. This much is apparent to me. He is the same one who made plenty other identity disorder movies as John Malkovich and the Eternal Sunshine. While those movies were terrible this one is even one of the worst. They're all bad. When one sees a movie... do they want to be told who they are? This is one and then some.The movie apparently has only one message: graphic animated nudity on a puppet man. This is conveyed most literally, as seeing the puppet's penis, but it's all subversive, as when the puppet man takes his face off and he becomes ""nude"". This is a metaphor."
139,Anomalisa,7,20 March 2016,"Bold, unique, challenging, bewildering.","This is a very adult film. Don't let the fact it's stop motion animation make you think otherwise. The film unfolds pretty dully if truth be told. Most of the film is set inside a hotel bedroom. It does pick up however. The fact it's animated is definitely in its favour. It makes it much more interesting and gives it an off kilter edge. There are other slightly surreal quirks to the story that intrigue.The main character could be said to be having a mid life crisis or suffering from depression or even some sort of breakdown. It isn't made clear which of these might be the case. My own personal interpretation is that the main character is certainly not happy with this life but the cause of this is perhaps his lack of perspective. He seems disinterested in anyone or anything but at the same time desperately wants to find someone interesting to make him feel better. He finds this person but of course it doesn't last and he's back to feeling crap again. He seems foolish, self absorbed and inconsiderate. BUT, he also seems very human, all too human unfortunately...... Very like the rest of us. I guess the moral of the story is to remember to appreciate what you have, even though that can be hard at times. There is probably a lot more to the interpretation of this film than I am able to realise. This is just what I was able to get out of it. I would recommend it but don't expect to be entertained but rather intrigued and challenged."
140,Anomalisa,7,13 March 2016,"It's not as deep as it thinks it is, but it's still clever","Anomalisa is a stop motion comedy-drama for adults. A writer attending a conference is having a major emotional crisis and, through a stranger he meets in a hotel, finally experiences something extraordinary. David Thewlis voices the main character excellently and Jennifer Jason Leigh is very good as well, but interestingly one actor voices all the other characters as a metaphor to show how for the protagonist, everyone around him is the same. Anomalisa is a film constructed from those kinds of metaphors and messages about humanity, and it's a film where very little happens. Some may question why it's in stop-motion, but it works very well as an animation. It is very mature for an animated movie, but not in a silly way unlike in films such as Team America World Police. Visually, it's excellent and there are many strong moments throughout. Ultimately, this bittersweet movie does affect you emotionally, albeit in a quiet, mundane sort of way and despite the fact that there are no humans in it, it feels like a very honest look at humanity, loneliness and the boredom. Still, it's not an entirely successful product. It's pretentious, often dull and has some cringe-worthy lines of dialogue. With its metaphors, ordinary settings and subtle messages clearly writer Charlie Kaufman, behind the similarly pretentious and overpraised Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, thinks that's enough to make the film powerful and interesting. It isn't. Not an complete success and very much one for the critics, but still an interesting animated film that's definitely not for kids.7/10"
141,Anomalisa,7,9 March 2016,Anomalisa,"-Anomalisa is a 2015 American stop-motion comedy-drama film directed and produced by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson, and written by Kaufman based on his 2005 play of the same name. It was released on December 30, 2015 by Paramount Pictures. The film follows a lonely self-help author (voiced by David Thewlis) who perceives everyone as identical (Tom Noonan) until he meets a unique woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) in a Cincinnati hotel.-Anomalisa was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, and five Annie Awards. It became the first animated film to win the Grand Jury Prize at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival, after premiering at the Telluride Film Festival on September 4, 2015.--Production: -The puppets were created with the use of 3D printers, with multiple copies of each character. 18 Michaels and six Lisas were created. While Johnson was told that such realistic animation would be ""disturbing and off-putting,"" he disagreed. To that end, a goal of the film was for viewers to ""forget they were looking at something animated and just get wrapped up in the scene,"" further explaining that ""the challenge we felt with so much animated stuff is that you're always conscious of the animation, and we kept asking, 'What if we could escape that? What would it be like?'"" -The film was in production for more than two years, gathering only fractions of seconds of footage each day. In some cases, Kaufman states that on average about twelve frames were shot a day.--Critical response: -Rotten Tomatoes reports a 92% approval based on 178 reviews; the average rating is 8.4 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, ""Anomalisa marks another brilliant and utterly distinctive highlight in Charlie Kaufman's filmography, and a thought-provoking treat for fans of introspective cinema."" The film also holds an 88/100 score on Metacritic based on 45 reviews, indicating ""universal acclaim"".-Writing for Time Out and awarding the film five out of five stars, David Calhoun wrote, ""It's what you imagine might have happened if Charlie Kaufman had got his hands on Up in the Air or Lost in Translation."" Drew McWeeny of Hitfix called it ""the most shattering experiment yet from Charlie Kaufman"" and graded it an ""A+"". LA Weekly's Amy Nicholson gave the film an ""A"" and wrote, ""Kaufman is taking our brains apart and showing us the gears."" Lauren Sarner of Inverse states that despite ""dipping into the Uncanny Valley effect with distractingly creepy visuals,"" it's still been generating great buzz.-Stephanie Zacharek of TIME responded less positively, arguing, ""Michael doesn't recognize that every other human being is alone in his or her skin too. And once you start reckoning with Anomalisa's obsession with self-absorption, the novelty of this one-man pity party begins to wear off. A little puppet pain goes a long way."""
142,Anomalisa,6,24 February 2016,"What makes you, you and what makes me, me?","Somewhere in the middle of the second act, the word 'anomalisa' is coined and the cute meaning of the non-word put a smile on my face. The second act is stupendous on so many levels, but sadly it is sandwiched between two lackluster acts that pull the film down a notch. Charlie Kaufman is an acquired taste. His themes of social isolation and deep loneliness are perennial. When his surreal vision is coupled with an understanding director the film lifts off the canvas. But I am afraid Anomalisa is not on the same level as Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Adaptation. It does however come really close. Michael Stone (David Thewlis), a world renowned author that specializes in customer service, is a man who is unable to interact deeply with other people. His low sensitivity to excitement, and his lack of interest make him a man living a repetitive life on his own terms. But, when he goes on a business trip, he meets a stranger - an extraordinary stranger (Jennifer Jason Leigh), which slowly becomes a cure for his negative view on life that possibly will change his mundane life forever. Even though the first act can feel uninteresting and borders on flatlining tedium, I completely understand the purpose of every aesthetic choice made by writer Charlie Kaufman and director Duke Johnson. We get into Michael Stone's world straight away - everybody in his world looks the same and speaks in the same voice. Every character is voiced by Tom Noonan. Michael Stone (even his name is a metaphor) is crippled by the mundanity of life and he longs for someone or even something to change it. He sees everyone out there eking out a sorry existence of a life and he is tired of fighting it and being the last person on earth. Once he reaches Cincinnati for a conference he tries to reach out to an old girlfriend for solace and connection but he doesn't go very far before he gets rejected. The film takes its time to establish Stone's world and mindset, and it does the job methodically and meticulously. The narrative skims on the surface of life's banality and it occasionally dips under your skin pulling gently at your heartstrings. The action is so surreptitious that I couldn't pinpoint when exactly the trajectory takes a dip.It then hits a home run with the middle act. That's the core and the spine. That's the beating heart. Just when Stone is slowly getting resigned to this mundane life, he hears a unique female voice reverberating through the corridor of the 10th floor of Fregoli Hotel. What then transpires is a tender love story of chanced meeting and fate. I feel I must tell you that it culminates in an eye-popping sex act that feels at once hilarious, warm, soul- shattering and natural. This sequence reportedly took six months to animate! It serves the narrative so well that for the duration of it I completely forgot I was watching a stop-motion animated feature. The middle act is heavenly poignant and it really had me in a warm bubble. But, of course, the dreaded morning after thingie had to come in to lay everything to waste. The final act happens fast and furious, and for me it just didn't give everything a satisfying closure. Stone, like many people I know, is in love with the honeymoon phase. It is a great idea but the closing events don't elevate the narrative. That is a shame. As it turns out, Anomalisa is a film about moments and the sum total of these sublime moments doesn't quite work. But that doesn't matter so much because the film manages to do something that not many films out there do or even try to do - it begs me to ask myself the question ""what makes me, me and what makes you, you?""PS - I had a good night's rest to think about it and I feel the sexual sequence is as powerful as the one in Don't Look Now. In both films, if you were to take the scene out, they will completely be disposable."
143,Anomalisa,7,8 February 2016,Anomalisa,"As a screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman wrote some of the most subversive and ingenious films from the last decades, such as Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. However, when he debuted as a director with Synecdoche, New York, he didn't leave me completely satisfied, because even though its concept was provocative, it was confusedly implemented, even though the film certainly offered various pros, such as its eccentric style and solid performances. And in his second film, Anomalisa (which he co- directed with Duke Johnson), something similar happens: despite including interesting elements, the final result feels obtuse and not totally satisfactory. The characters of Anomalisa are well built, immediately transmitting their nature and personality through subtle details which express very much with the slightest effort. The main character, Michael Stone, is a successful man in his career, but he's empty in the inside, something which is represented with the trick of assigning the same voice (from actor Tom Noonan) to all the people around him. It doesn't matter whether they are men, women or children... Michael listens to everything exactly the same, something which I found a powerful and very precise metaphor of depression. The screenplay displays the details of a grey and humdrum life, which crush the main character's spirit, until chance offers him a glimpse of hope. Unfortunately, that establishment of a situation with big potential gets gradually diluted until concluding on an insipid and excessively simple note, which left me thinking ""such a preparation for this?"" And that was twice as notorious after certain intriguing scenes which suggest an abrupt change in the narrative. After one hour of frugal realism, something happens which could fundamentally alter the nature of the movie, taking us to the kind of ""weird"" story which characterizes Kaufman. But no... false alarm. Oh, and I can't forget to mention the fact that Anomalisa was made in stop motion, probably making it the first film of this kind specifically made to adults (by the way, I have to stress the fact that Anomalisa is definitely NOT a movie for kids); however, the attention to the detail and excellent voice performances made me forget about the technique in order to focus on the characters' emotions. Besides, some elements inherent to the stop motion subtly incorporate themselves to the story, suggesting something much more ambitious and reflexive... which is also ignored. In conclusion, I have mixed opinions about Anomalisa, because even though it includes fascinating ideas of a huge potential, it doesn't bother to develop them. Nevertheless, I think I can give a moderate recommendation to Anomalisa as an unusual experiment which deserves more respect due to its mere existence than its dramatic impact."
144,Anomalisa,10,7 January 2016,"""I don't know yet. It's just obvious that you are.""","It was the great Roger Ebert, then at the end of his life, who remarked on writing a particularly difficult review, ""If you understand something you can explain it so that almost anyone can understand it. If you don't, you won't be able to understand your own explanation."" It is no coincidence that this was in response to the review of Synecdoche New York, which shares the same director as Anomalisa. Rarely in life, and only if you are lucky, a movie comes a long that describes exactly what you are feeling exactly when you are feeling it. I have been fortunate enough for this to happen on at least four occasions. The first that I can remember was in watching There Will Be Blood. I was midway through high school and my lack of faith was reflected by the terrible and wonderful lead character. The second time was upon viewing the previously mentioned Synecdoche N.Y. Though I won't say much on that as I hope a review will follow someday. There was two years ago with Boyhood for somewhat obvious reasonsÂ… and now again with Anomalisa.What is love? The answer, wrapped around and around a thousand times in my mind. The stars do not lead me to it. If it is real, can we save it? Can we save a love that keeps us up at night, then one day dies? It's pieces are in shambles in the living room and I can't put them together again. I don't know these answers, and it's clear that Anomalisa's writer and co-director, Charlie Kaufman, doesn't either. Though he wants to know.You've waited for this film for what seems like your entire life, and only now you realize that you had been waiting. The rooms in your life change color, and the sheets are laid neatly across the bed. Though you didn't arrange them this way, did you? So now, you are somewhere else with someone else, but how? Kaufman, whom we can feel in every frame, is an old friend pulling at our heart string of nostalgia. If Anomalisa offers any closure, it is the simple comfort that you are not alone in your confusion. In this way, to those who wander, Anomalisa is a relief. Yet, paradoxically, you will find very little here in the way of relief. For just like the stories of youth, the ending never changes; there is no ending. Anomalisa is walking home in the rain and finding your last cigarette, but not having a lighter.We, like the characters in the film, are puppets: complete with wooden bodies and invisible strings. It is not a life. It is an act. We are puppets imagining what our lives would have been had we been human. Here is the richest of fiction, the kind that's utterly true.So what of the actual details; the sets, the score, the cinematography? It doesn't matter here and it never did. I think we can save the labels for this one. For who would the labels serve? It feels only right that at the end I realize now this review wasn't for you. It was for me. No wonder I still have so much to say and so little ways in which to say it. So rather than try any harder to understand, I will end simply with the truth and only that which I know to be true. Go see Anomalisa, in any way you can."
145,Anomalisa,7,24 March 2016,"Very realistic, very depressing movie","This is one confusing movie. You do not know what these characters in the movie are? Are they puppets? Are they they animations? Are they real human beings acting like puppets? Is the main character gay because his love interests seem to be men when he talks on the phone to them? Does everybody look the same because they were too lazy to create different types or is it just the main character who sees everybody as the same?.We follow a motivational speaker on his way from the airport into his luxury hotel and with him experience what the fate of every business traveler is. Subjected to the same talk by taxi drivers, hotel personal and the crushing loneliness in a strange town resulting in having sex with a total stranger, believing for a second that the physical closeness brought real intimacy.I went to an afternoon showing and there were children in the audience. The characters in the movie, though animations ,look anatomically very real and they perform real sex acts including oral sex. I heard the kids gasping watching the guy go down on the woman and I assume that the adults with these kids did not a lot of research before taking their kids into this R rated movie. I do not see any harm in children seeing nudity, but I think that smaller kids are too young to watch oral sex and explicit sex acts. Oh well, I am probably naive, they all get in from the Inernet anyway nowadays. I thought the movie was a very realistic, i.e. very depressive picture of real life and I walked out of if with a sense of hopelessness."
146,Anomalisa,9,17 March 2016,The Most Human And Realistic Film Ever,"Anomalisa Author Michael Stone (David Thewlis) sees everyone as the same (Tom Noonan) until he meets Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh).This film has had nearly every review say that it is one of the most perfect films ever made and nearly all of them have given it five stars. So is it as good as the reviews say it is? Yes. Anomalisa is one of those extremely rare films that makes you feel as if you are one of the characters. You feel what each character feels and when they feel it because of how well it is done. It's brilliantly made and the screenplay is fantastic. The acting in it is also superb and makes it seem much more realistic... and it's animated. It is one of the most realistic and human films ever made and the way everything is done and interpreted is amazing. It's funny yet dramatic which gives it an extra human feeling and adds more emotion to it in many scenes. It's cleverly written and has so many things hidden in it. The three cast members give brilliant performances and make the film seem more realistic and they really get you inside the characters head making the film much more powerful.Funny, Heart warming and an extreme rarity to feel what the characters are feeling Anomalisa is probably the most realistic and human film ever and most likely one of the best films of the year. An amazing achievement for an animated film. ***** <-- Five Stars (Out Of Five)"
147,Anomalisa,9,26 February 2017,alienation made beautiful,"There are films that linger with you like a second itchy skin for days and weeks. It's been a year now since I saw Anomalisa and its shadow still lingers with me. It's telling the brutal fall of us all when the loneliness that we wear like a second skin sheds away with each infatuation, only to cover us again thicker with each disillusionment. Because not everyone is lucky enough to find ""the only other person in the world"". I love Charlie Kaufman, and Anomalisa is one of his best, most gentle and brutal story."
148,Anomalisa,8,6 February 2017,Subtleness and Emotion in Puppetry,"Anomalisa is a film that encapsulates struggles like lost love, alienation, ennui and midlife crisis in a profound way not seen much in cinema nowadays. A visual distinction the film has is that there are no humans in this film. There are only puppets. And yet, the film invoked emotion on a level most live-action romances are unable to achieve. Anomalisa is an impeccable technical feat as well as a pure piece of introspective cinema, and one of the best films of 2016.The film follows depressed author Michael, voiced by a down-to-earth David Thewlis, as he travels to Cincinnati to showcase his newest book at a customer service convention. He has a wife and two kids, but decides to meet his ex, whom he keeps on seeing visions of. From the get go, we know something is wrong. Everybody else seems to be voiced by the same person, suggesting Michael's perception of everyone around him is concurrent with his own life --- a grind. He then meets a woman named Lisa, gracefully voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh. When her voice enters through the floodgate of the alienating voices by Tom Noonan, it really stands out. Lisa and Michael's relationship is one of the most touching and unconventional ones in recent filmic memory. Insecure or simply shy viewers will instantly relate to Lisa's character as she feels unwanted and unloved, all with a scar she conceals. Her gentle voice and humility makes her likable. Fuelled by the audience's familiarity with Michael's search for love and Carter Burwell's emotionally charged score, it is ultimately a relationship that will leave you with a happy tear in your eye.Anomalisa is also a great character study of the main protagonist --- Michael. His midlife crisis is layered and his self-contained personality not fully expressed. Maybe his endless conferences and customer service work made every voice sound the same to him too; this is one of a myriad of theories Anomalisa suggests about its main character. Later on in the film, the viewer can also gather a sense as to why he had that bad relationship in the past. The film unfolds and more is told about his state. Nuances that suggest Michael's distance from society are shown throughout the film. For example, he seems to sometimes ignore or go against whatever people are telling him (a taxi driver says try Cincinnati chilli or go to the zoo, and opportunities are right in front of him but he purposefully ignores them). I would not be surprised if this film was shown to a film studies class in the near future. Stop-motion is a delicate process and the results are usually charming. This film, however, strives for realism, something it inexplicably achieves. Not many animated features look as realistic as Anomalisa, and sometimes it felt like you are watching real people. Well, other than fluffy skin and the joins on the characters' faces, the latter of which can be a metaphor for our identities and personalities, as shown in one scene where Michael's face seemingly is falling off. Even the whole idea of a puppet society could be interpreted as our willingness to work, as shown through multiple plot points throughout. Overall, the film has an incredibly unique style. Thematically alike to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Anomalisa co-director Charlie Kaufman's most famous screenplay), the film implies that imperfections are what makes us human, and that all of us should look for what makes someone special inside, and you'll notice that in the title. Two lost and lonely souls looking for love has not been executed this surreally well since 2003's Lost in Translation.Ending with a bittersweet and cryptic ending, one character has a symbolic revelation that leaves you utterly happy. After you are done with the film, you start valuing your own life and others a tad bit more. Anomalisa shows us the importance of knowing who you are but also to be responsible for your choices in life. Otherwise, they will still haunt you, physically and mentally. Charlie Kaufman & Duke Johnson crafted an emotional odyssey that explores some of the most important issues of the human condition while also delivering a beautiful love story. You will be contemplating one of the film's questions for ages: ""What is it to be alive""?"
149,Anomalisa,8,29 January 2017,"Kaufman engages the psyche instead of the mind in the much more simplistic ""Anomalisa""","Charlie Kaufman is the world's foremost expert on the mind of the of lonely white male and ""Anomalisa"" might be his deepest foray into its recesses, yet somehow his most accessible.Considering the rest of Kaufman's catalog, ""Anomalisa"" is rather straightforward. Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) is a customer service expert making a one-night visit to Cincinnati to give a talk. He's clearly lonely and unhappy in his marriage and thinking about reconnecting with an ex who lives there. Eventually he meets Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and with her the promise of genuine love, connection and purpose.The twist on this rather mundane plot is that everyone Michael meets, aside from Lisa, looks and sounds the same (they're all voiced by Tom Noonan, men and women characters alike). In fact, Michael is staying at the Fregoli Hotel, a reference to the rare disorder in which a person holds the paranoid delusion that everyone they encounter is the same person in disguise. Therein lies the purpose of using stop-motion animation, that and the bigger metaphor of what makes us humans and not all identical machines.So while ""Anomalisa"" might be a good 90-minute ""Intro to Charlie Kaufman"" course, the existentialism and most notably the melancholy are taken to the next level. Michael is a brooding sad sack, a tough character to relate to because he clearly takes everything in his life for granted. Of course his profession is a sad bit of irony; he makes a living telling people the best way to make other people feel special, when no one seems special to him. Except Lisa, hence the film's title.Lisa is a quiet, awkward woman with a terrible self image, yet to Michael, just the fact that she has a different voice rings clear. She is amazing and unique to him, yet to the objective person, she's terribly ordinary, thus confounding the true nature of Michael's delusion.For an animated film, Kaufman and co-director Duke Johnson create a lot of deeply human moments and tap into a lot of what makes us tick. They put a ton of care into the film's most intimate moments that you forget everything is made of clay more or less. Considering it's adapted from a radio play Kaufman wrote about 10 years prior, Kaufman and Johnson breathe quite a bit of visual life into the story.""Anomalisa"" has a slow pace to it, but it echoes the mundane hell Michael perceives himself to be in. After so many films that engage with you intellectually, Kaufman tries to engage with the psyche and it makes for a less entertaining but more earnest viewing experience.The ideas and message of ""Anomalisa"" are more simplistic than profound, so the emotional resonance is fairly minimal compared to the epiphanies that Kaufman has delivered in the past. Basically, it wouldn't be a surprise if this was your favorite or most disappointing Kaufman film. The cerebral efforts are definitely the more exciting, but there's a subdued brilliance to ""Anomalisa"" that I expect will grow my admiration over time.~Steven CThanks for reading!

150,Anomalisa,3,10 January 2017,The comedy is very much of each and more if it is black,"The first thing I have to say is that despite being short, I have become long. He could not wait to see if it was over. The scriptwriter and director is very special, clear and either you like or you do not like anything. Personally, I do not like any of his films since I do not share his humor. For a long time, I did not understand what I was telling and only when I read the argument did I understand what I wanted to say and I think there is no worse thing for a director, and I, who direct short films, I know, do not understand what Is meant.Spoiler:I've always said that in the animation, making beautiful plans is extremely simple, you just have to think about them, although many people say they do not need to, but this is an audiovisual mute, but we take away the visual part and that's it. In this case as is typical, we do not have the camera. That if you have a nice picture. We can not qualify the actors, since they do not exist, I do not mean with this that I do not like animation, quite the opposite, but I think all the gestures of an actor, here they are not. I have a lot of sex scene, I do not know why he put it all, was it lacking? I do not know, maybe it's because I've bored"
151,Anomalisa,7,28 December 2016,"My liking of this film hinged on one key clue,","and that was the name of his hotel, Fregoli.According to Wikipedia: ""The Fregoli delusion, or the delusion of doubles, is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise. The syndrome may be related to a brain lesion and is often of a paranoid nature, with the delusional person believing themselves persecuted by the person they believe is in disguise.""Without this key tidbit of information, this film appeared to be a confusing day-in-the-life of a bored and self-centered man who makes his living teaching people how to be congenial, helpful, and appreciative, when he himself is none of those things.*With* that information, we see the perceptually different story of an isolated man, who struggles on day after week after year, trying to find meaning and purpose in a world that is consistently fouled by a haze of mental illness. Either way, the animation is top-notch."
152,Anomalisa,7,23 December 2016,flawed human characters,"Michael Stone (David Thewlis) is a successful British author of customer service efficiencies with a wife and son. He is tired and lonely. He's in Cincinnati to speak at a conference. He reconnects with his ex Bella Amarossi whom he abandoned 11 years ago. The meeting goes badly and he gets drunk. He encounters Lisa Hesselman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Emily staying at the hotel to attend his speech. He has an one-night fling with Lisa who has low esteem from her facial scar.Michael is a terribly flawed character. He's not appealing but he's definitely compelling. Lisa is an endearing character. It might be more intriguing to follow her as the lead. Michael's sad self-destructive journey is interesting and sometimes infuriating. The use of Tom Noonan as the voice of everybody else is distracting especially with the female characters. I don't know if Bella is supposed to be a transvestite but she sounds like one. It leads to unnecessary confusion although I wouldn't put it pass Charlie Kaufman to be complicated. Overall, this is an uniquely human animation."
153,Anomalisa,7,20 December 2016,Hollyweird man.,"Certainly the oddest movie I've sen this year (and that includes Tale of Tales). It's a Charlie Kaufman sort of puppetry animation thing where most of the characters (male and female) are voiced, in the same voice, by the same person ( Tom Noonan).It's as weird as Kaufmann's masterpiece 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. Weirder in fact. Especially as the animation is part perfection, part shabby chic which just adds to its surrealism.Everything about the movie is surreal and centres around the central character, a celebrated motivational speaker (Michael Stone, played to laconic perfection by David Thewlis) who has a breakdown in Cincinnati whilst beginning an affair with the only other non- Tom Noonan voiced character, Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh).Her imperfections attract him, but mainly it's the fact that her voice makes her different to everyone else. A ray of light in a homogenous world.It becomes very touching in parts and in times to come I'd expect it to be a much studied piece of work from a genuine Hollywood outsider and visionary.But be warned: it's more Hollyweird than Hollywood."
154,Anomalisa,9,13 March 2016,Anomalisa,"I heard the title of this film when it come up during awards season, then I saw the trailer and knew immediately I had to see this film, it had a limited cinema release, but I'm glad I found it, from director Duke Johnson and writer/director Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). Basically customer service expert Michael Stone (Harry Potter's David Thewlis) is travelling to Cincinnati, Ohio to promote his latest book at a convention in a hotel, he perceives everyone around him, including his wife and son, to all to have the same face and voice (Last Action Hero's Tom Noonan is everyone else). Michael tries to practise his talk in his hotel room, but he is haunted by the memory of his old flame Bella, who he abruptly left years ago, she wrote him an angry letter, Michael arranges to meet Bella in the hotel bar, she is still angry, and storms off outraged when he invites her to his room. Going for a walk, Michael enters an adult toy store, mistaking it for a children's toy store, and wants to buy something for his son, he is fascinated by an antique Japanese animatronic woman and buys it. After Michael takes a shower he hears a female voice, he rushes out of his room to find who the voice belongs to, it is that of an insecure woman Lisa Hesselman (The Hateful Eight's Jennifer Jason Leigh), who attending Michael's talk with her friend Emily. Michael is enraptured by Lisa's unique appearance and voice, he takes both women to the bar for a drink, Lisa is surprised when Michael invites her to his room, despite her claiming to be nothing special and that everyone goes for Emily. But Michael finds her captivating, admiring her facial scar that she hides and does not to talk about, he encourages her to sing, she sings Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"", he also wants to hear about her life, she declares herself an anomaly, he nicknames ""Anomalisa"", then they become intimate and have sex. Michael has a nightmare in which he is called by the hotel manager, he confesses his love for him and tells him he and Lisa cannot be together, then many other people along the way pursue him saying the same, and Michael's face falls apart. After waking from the bad dream, Michael is inspired to ask Lisa to run away with him and start a new life together, she agrees, but he is annoyed by her eating habits during breakfast, and slowly Lisa's voice and face transform into the same as everyone else's. It comes to Michael's convention talk, he starts to stumble his words, before suffering a breakdown, confessing that he has no one to talk to and ranting about the American government, the audience is alienated, and Lisa watching is concerned. Michael returns home to Los Angeles, he gives his son the gift of the Japanese animatronic woman, his son is perplexed, his wife has arranged a surprise party, but Michael cannot recognise any of the guests, angering her. It ends with Michael sitting alone on the stairs as the animatronic woman sings a traditional Japanese children's song, Lisa writes a letter to Michael, saying she hopes they will meet again, her friend Emily, sitting beside her in the car, has her own face. The film is made up entirely of 3D printed puppets, the technique of stop-motion to bring them to life is superb, and it doesn't shy away from adult subjects, it includes swearing and even a sensitive sex scene. The concept of the protagonist bored of the sameness around him, seeing identical faces and hearing identical voices, most likely caused by a mid-life crisis, really gives a profound and humane thought, about the repetitiveness of relationships, there is a deeper weirdness in the world we take for granted, and that we need to believe we and out loved ones are all unique and special, it has been called ""the most human film in years"", it is strange and sad, but certainly unlike anything you would have seen before, a brilliant animated drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Very good!"
155,Anomalisa,9,23 January 2016,One of the Most Mature Animated Pictures,"Yes Anomalisa is a mature animated picture; it is mature not just in content, but in its philosophy and the themes which the film conveys as well. It's also not QUITE as strange as other Kaufman movies, making this one easier to watch than Synecdoche, New York or Adaptation.With Kaufman it is safe to expect dark drama and a lot of philosophy, but this film is delightfully humorous as well. The interactions between the various characters is what sells the humor in the film. There are also a couple running gags which refer to a scene early in the film which can't be ignored. Anomalisa is funny throughout, so see it with a crowd.What a powerful message this film conveys: it asks what it means to be an individual in a world where conformity is the only way to survive. Granted, this message could have been portrayed in a more subtle manner than having Tom Noonan voice EVERY PERSON except Michael and Lisa (on top of the fact they all look alike). Another note on that aspect is that it took 10 minutes into the film to register that Tom Noonan was voicing males and females alike. Once noticed it doesn't seem to be a bother, but they could have easily used a different voice actor to voice all the females who aren't Lisa and the message would still be understood.The only thing that reaches the Kaufman level of out-of-the-ordinary in this film is a five minute sequence late in the film. It almost puts a break on the action of the film as well, but it proves to be a sequence to fit more than bizarre sequences in other Kaufman films, such as when John Malkovich talks to himself in Being John Malkovich.However, Anomalisa proves to be a deeply moving film overall. It touches on love, individuality, it is drenched in humor and it is visually brilliant. While Inside Out would deserve the win as well, this film might win the Oscar for best animated motion picture of the year.3.5/4.0"
156,Anomalisa,8,20 January 2016,Is this the Secret Life of Crash Test Dummies . . .,". . . or the solution to the 2016 Oscar Kerfluffle? I have no idea what color Tom Noonan is, but let's give him BOTH the Best Supporting Actor AND the Best Supporting Actress Golden Statuettes for his great job of voicing ""Everyone Else"" in Charlie Kaufman's ANOMALISA. That leaves the Best Actor Award for David Thewlis (to make up for his getting such a raw deal a while back from Voldemort) and, of course, Jennifer Jason Leigh gets to dangle (the Best Actress trophy, what else?). In future years, instead of all Oscar acting nominations being restricted to the ""Usual Suspects"" (that is, Kevin Hart, Queen Latifah, Tyler Perry, and Cicely Tyson), let's either ELIMINATE the acting categories OR require that the NBA's Auburn Hills, MI, Pistons start a MINIMUM of four White players to reflect the demographics of their Auburn Hills home base (anything less is just Racist!). Nobody knows the color of film editors, make-up folks, costume people, and sound technicians, so their Oscar Nominations are free of hateful controversy. By restricting future Acting Noms to Animated Feature Voice Talent--such as the ANAMOLISA trio--Rich People like Spike Lee and Jada Smith won't have to go slumming at White Castles on Oscar Night!"
157,Anomalisa,9,19 January 2016,Delicately ultra-orindinary,"In many ways, and this isn't for the mere sake of clever wordplay, Anomalisa Â– the latest film from the weird and wonderful mind of Charlie Kaufman Â– is an anomaly in and of itself. Where the endless possibilities of animation have taken audiences on fantastical, often family-friendly and largely un-film-able journeys, Kaufman and stop-motion specialist Duke Johnson rather chose to spend 48 months carefully animating a film so deeply, and, in large part, depressingly rooted in the monotony of everyday life. But thanks to over 1,700 backers via kickstarter.com, Anomalisa is a treat to watch. If Kaufman's juxtaposition of daily intricacies with surrealistic stints isn't something you're keen on chewing on, then at least the runtime also plays showcase to Johnson's delicately fashioned, though ultimately ultra-ordinary, animationÂ—which is especially expressive in adjustable portions on the dolls' faces. Interestingly enough, the gaps of these pieces remain visible. Although one could argue this highly visible detail distances them from these characters, being reminded that they're all puppets only stresses the universality of the source material, which, of all mediums, began as nothing more than an 'audio play'.FULL REVIEW HERE: http://indieadam.com/2016/01/20/anomalisa-2015-review-indieadam/"
158,Anomalisa,7,12 January 2016,An amorous anomaly.......,"Michael Stone, an author that specialises in customer service, is a man who is unable to interact deeply with other people. His low sensitivity to excitement, and his lack of interest makes him a man with a repetitive perspective on his own life. When he goes on a business trip, he meets a stranger, who slowly becomes a cure for his negative view........Coming from the mind of Kaufman, and featuring some of the most bizarrely beautiful animation I've seen in a while you should expect Anomalisa to be a little different to your typical movie.Thewlis plays Michael with a air of depressive desperation, and at the beginning of the film, you suspect that he's just your average business man in the midst of a mid life crisis, ringing up an ex he hasn't seen for ten years, for maybe the chance of an encounter, but then your ears become aware that up until this point, every single voice apart from Michaels is the same person.....take note of the name of the hotel that Michael is staying in.It appears that Michael may have some sort of mental illness that makes him visualise every other person he meets as the one and the same, thus the rationale for his bleak outlook on life, which is depicted by the mundane billboards and advertising.But then he hears a different voice, which is Lisa's, who could be the anomaly of the film..........Anomalisa. She is different to everyone else, whimsical yet fascinating, and Michael is captivated by her the minute he hears her voice.But the more he gets to know her, and once he has his 'fix', her voice begins to show signs that it's becoming the same voice he hears everywhere, maybe she isn't the anomaly he first thought she was, maybe his condition is worsening.The film offers lots to explore, is Michael dreaming the narrative, is he experiencing a sort of Jacobs Ladder type death experience, after all, the morning after the night before offers some bizarre twists that just boggle the mind and ask even more questions.Did he abuse Lisa unknowingly? Did he die after his Tryst?, just what is it with his face, was he contemplating suicide when he heard Lisa's voice, hence her being the metaphorical saviour? And just why does he hear his sons voice in the same tone.It's a wonderful movie, probably one of Kaufman's most accessible movies in some time, but the animation gives it a truly sinister sheen to it. It would have been so easy to have cast Noonan as everyone else, alÃ¡ Being John Malkovich, but here, the animations compliments the narrative.Well worth seeing, if you fancy something a little more left-field."
159,Anomalisa,10,3 February 2016,A phenomenal film,"Anomalisa is Charlie Kaufman's latest, and, in my opinion, one of his greatest. It follows the story of a man in crisis, who sees everyone as the same person, voiced by literally the exact same actor and fitted with the same face. As he prepares for a speech he is due to give, he meets Lisa, a person who stands out to him from the others, and the film steadily becomes one of the most realistic, emotional and deeply effecting films I've seen in years. It's a beautifully crafted film with some of the best animation I've seen. It genuinely feels like you're watching real people on screen. It's so raw, so moving that I was completely taken aback by it. Kaufman is definitely my favourite director. And it's powerful, honest and grounded films like this that settle that opinion entirely. Amazing. I implore you to give this one a look. It's unforgettable."
160,Anomalisa,10,17 January 2016,Fantastic dramedy from the brilliant mind of Charlie Kaufman. One of the year's best films and a must see.,"ANOMALISA (2015) **** (Voices of: David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh & Tom Noonan) Fantastic dramedy from the brilliant mind of Charlie Kaufman (who co-directed with talented animator Duke Johnson) about a depressed middle-aged author (brilliantly realized by Thewlis) who comes to a cross-roads the night before a speech in Cincinnati who finds a breath of fresh-air in an unlikely form - a very self-conscious fan (Leigh equally excellent). What sets the film apart from its familiar trappings is the clever use of stop-motion animation with remarkably facile puppetry that makes the story even more compelling and surprisingly human(e). Noonan is a hoot as the voices of literally every other character in the film. One of the year's best films and a must see."
161,Anomalisa,9,7 January 2016,One of the best films of 2015,"I am writing this because of the backlash that Kaufman is receiving right now.Kaufman is a brand and his films tend to attract a certain type of audience, whether you consider it intellectual or pretentious is up to you. His movies do appeal primarily to the brain as they pose different puzzles that need to be solved in order to understand what is really going on and how one should react to it. At the same time, Kaufman's films tend to be quite heartfelt and human, so the final effect is of complexity and emotional weight.The problem with Anomalisa is that the film is quite straightforward. Beyond the amazing puppetry, there is little left to discuss, so one either likes the theme or doesn't. Thus, if one does not think of Anomalisa as a single film but considers it within the scope of Charlie Kaufman films it might be weak, boring, the worst movie ever etc.But Anomalisa is a beautiful standalone film. The stop motion technique itself makes the proceedings intriguing while never becoming too flashy except during the shower and sex scenes. The use of the puppet faces and Tom Noonan's voice is a masterstroke.What really makes the film however is that it gives space to every single encounter and empty moment. You cannot make a film about loneliness and frustration unless there is some loneliness and frustration in it. That is exactly what one gets in drawn out scenes with taxi drivers, lift boys etc, and they are all infused with sufficient dry humour to avoid becoming overbearing.I will not go further into discussing the exact relationships between the characters in the film. At the center of it all is a broken man who is looking for a cure but does not get it. I only hope it helps people in a similar situation cope with their predicament.In conclusion, Anomalisa is a great film, one of the best films in 2015, but your mileage may vary and your perception will be heavily influenced by how you perceive Kaufman's body of work to begin with. If you are thinking whether to watch Anomalisa or not, maybe it's best for you to read the seven-stars reviews. I find them a good litmus test in this instance."
162,Anomalisa,10,26 January 2016,"Funny, surreal, and thought-provoking","Filmed in stop-motion animation, Duke Johnson and Charlie Kaufman's (""Synecdoche, New York"") Anomalisa is a look at loneliness and its psychological effects. Filled with existential despair, it is also funny, surreal, and thought-provoking, a film that can touch you in ways you never thought possible. Nominated for Best Animated film at the 2016 Oscars and Golden Globes, it's subject is one Michael Stone (voice of David Thewlis, ""The Theory of Everything""), a middle-aged, disheveled-looking author and customer service advocate, who has come to Cincinnati from Los Angeles to deliver a talk at a conference on the subject ""How May I Help You Help Them?"" We follow Michael as he arrives at the airport and takes a cab to the Hotel Fregoli (named after a paranoid psychological condition). Michael's world is a projection of what he has become, a slightly paranoid depressed man skimming along on the surface of life. We soon notice that everyone talks in the same voice whether male or female (the voice of Tom Noonan, ""The House of the Devil""). Each ""person"" has the same facial characteristics, the same low energy, an effect of blandness and a robotic presence. During the ride to the hotel, Michael does his best to avoid conversing with the asthmatic cabdriver who attempts to make small talk about the weather and gives him suggestions about how wonderful the chili is in Cincinnati and that he must visit the zoo, two recommendations that seem to be of little interest to him.After checking into the hotel, he mechanically tips the bellhop, orders room service (which he never appears to eat) and goes through the motions of calling his wife and his son whom he calls ""Slugger,"" but there seems to be little emotional connection. Slugger wants a toy so dad picks up the first thing he sees in a sex toy shop, a supposedly rare model of a naked Japanese Geisha that is guaranteed to not be Sluggers' favorite toy. Out of loneliness, Michael calls Bella, the woman he deserted eleven years ago and they meet at the hotel for a drink but his inability to listen to her feelings and his fast move to invite her to his room swiftly ends the reunion.Now unhinged by his fears, he desperately begins knocking on doors in the hotel hallway and soon meets Emily and Lisa, two fans who came in from Akron to attend his lecture. Though Emily is the more attractive and more available of the two women, Michael fixates on Lisa and, after a few drinks, invites her back to his room. It is immediately noticeable that Lisa (the voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh, ""The Hateful Eight"") is not like the others. Her voice is the only one with any individuality. Lacking self-esteem, her continual put-downs of her looks and her intelligence is heartbreaking but nothing can deter Michael from his purpose. In his world of static uniformity, Lisa is an anomaly, a word he expands to refer to her as his ""anomalisa,"" which she loves.Soon their experience of connection extends to a sensitively-handled sexual encounter, her singing the Cindy Lauper song ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun,"" and his offer to leave his wife and have Lisa move back to L.A. with him. Before he wakes up in the morning, however, his delusions express themselves in a dream in which the hotel manager summons him to the office in the hotel basement and tells him that he must stay away from Lisa, reinforced by everyone else he meets. As he eats breakfast and rehearses his speech, his attitude towards Lisa changes as if he realized his mistake of getting too close to another person.Although Michael has delivered the same speech hundreds of times, at the conference the words seem to have lost their meaning and the audience sits silently as the speaker loses his grip on reality, talking about his unhappy life before remembering to tell people to always smile at the customer. In the speech, Michael asks the questions: What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to ache? (The second question seemingly answering the first).For Michael, there is no one out there. It is all him in various aspects of his personality, a three-dimensional projection of his state of mind. It is only when he can look outside of himself and connect with another human being who aches as much as he does, that he can suspend his mechanical thinking and act in the moment out of the experience of who he really is, a moment that may be artificial, but whose substance is true and real and also unforgettable."
163,Anomalisa,10,9 January 2016,"Emotional, surreal, true, touching and perfect","I have no words to describe how much I enjoyed this movie... Not only was the animation mind-bogglingly immaculate, but the core of it, the characters, was just... Wow... You really have to experience it for yourself, because this movie is, well, cerebral let's say, which is hard to describe vulgarly. It's not a very accessible movie, not for all audiences, but for cinema lovers this movie is a treat. Very re-watchable, there's a lot of metaphorical ideas throughout the movie that keeps questioning yourself about the reality of the movie, as we see it through the eyes of the protagonist. This movie deals with mental disorders, relationships, awkwardness, family, love and human interactions. This film feels extremely personal to Charlie Kaufman. This is, by far, the most original and surprising movie I've seen this year(2015), and i just can't find any flaws with it, like NONE, AT ALL!Anomalisa deserves a 10/10"
164,Anomalisa,8,17 February 2017,Surrealist Animation,"I haven't seen anything quite like this since I watched ""Eraserhead,"" The animation begins by looking as if everyone is a normal human being. Soon it becomes obvious that they have the same faces and the same voices, except for the main character. For a half hour this guy does everything a normal traveller does. He gets a cab ride from a tiresome cabbie, he checks into a hotel, he is taken to his room by a bellhop, and the room appears to be like every room we've ever seen. The difference, again, is that the faces and voices of everyone are the same. Michael Stone, our hero, orders room service. He then calls someone that he had a relationship with eleven year's previously, and he meets her for a drink. It's a disaster. She is a mess. He then hooks up with Lisa (Anomalisa) who is sort of dense and totally lacking in self esteem. He eventually has sex with her (quite graphic) and he is taken with her for the moment, but soon she begins to fade into a dull version of all the other people. The conclusion is interesting and heavy on the surrealism. He gets back to his home and strange things are going on. An unforgettable experience."
165,Anomalisa,9,29 January 2016,"Creepy, sad and strange; but also moving and inspiring!","'ANOMALISA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The first R-rated animated movie, to ever be nominated for Best Animated Feature (at the Academy Awards, and the Golden Globes), is this stop-motion drama flick. It was directed by Charlie Kaufman, in his third directorial effort (and it's his first time helming an animated feature), and Duke Johnson (who's had plenty of experience, directing animation on TV). The film was written by Kaufman, and it's based on his 2005 play (of the same name). The movie tells the story of a socially awkward 'self-help' author, who finally meets a young woman who inspires him; while on a business trip, away from his family. It stars the voice talents of David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noonan. I enjoyed it, about as much as I've enjoyed all of Charlie Kaufman's films (except for 'ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND', that's my favorite).Michael Stone (Thewlis) is a popular writer, who specializes in 'self-help' books; that travels to Cincinnati, to promote his newest novel. He has severe problems relating to other people, even his own wife and son; who he always hears speaking with the same male voice (Noonan). Then he meets a young woman, named Lisa (Leigh), and he thinks he's finally met someone he can connect with. The voices, in his head, keep trying to stop him though.The film is about everything you've probably come to expect, from Charlie Kaufman; except it's animated, using stop-motion puppets. The movie is really bizarre, but it's also a great examination; of what makes certain people unique, and unable to relate to others. Some people (including multiple friends of mine) think you can diagnose every person like this, with aspergers. Life is much more complicated than that though, obviously. The film is creepy, sad and strange; but it's also moving, and inspiring, in many ways. It's really interesting to watch, too, and just a really unique experience!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b_aLk3J5gh4"
166,Anomalisa,,22 January 2016,We're there among the puppets--a cool movie.,"""Look for what is special about each individual. Focus on that."" (Michael Stone, voice of David Thewlis) ""And so it goes,"" Kurt Vonnegut might have said about Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson's Anomalisa, an eerie stop-motion animation about a customer service motivational speaker who goes through the usual boredom of a night in a lonely city. Lost in Translation's tepid welcome of a fading movie star (Bill Murray) comes to mind immediately.The Michael Stone quote headlining this review is a clichÃ© he uses in his speech to his customer service conference attendees. Yet it masks the challenge Michael faces each moment of his existential agony: With a world of puppet-like, look alike creatures, Michael searches not only for their individuality but also for his place among them and the happiness that is eluding him.The defining action for him is his romantic relationship before his lecture with one of his fans from the admiring audience. Lisa (voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a demure, plain young call-center rep thrilled by his attention and hardly versed in the steps of romance. Yet, because of her quirky individuality and his limited charm, they get along, giving Michael a brief moment of rebellion (he does have a family, after all).There's a disguised depth this animation gives in the face of not distinguished characters and even less action. However, the everyday business is weighted with the sympathy we may have for this lost middle-aged, unremarkable character. His searches, his losses are ours made unique in his being a puppet. Therein may be the grandeur of this animation: If identity is so difficult for a puppet to find, how insane is our human search? Perhaps that is the genius of Charlie Kaufman. Look up his filmography on IMDb: It's impressively odd and, well, brilliant. Just don't expect anything extraordinary on the surface, except maybe a puppet sex scene. In the end the exterior banality will force you to look inside yourself for sympathy with the characters. Don't despair because a night in another town isn't usually that great anyway.""Each person you speak to has had a day, some other days have been good, some bad."" Stone"
167,Anomalisa,6,21 January 2016,An Anomaly of a Movie,"Okay, so my headline seems a little redundant given the title of the movie, but I honestly could not think of a more appropriate opening. Watch as the classic look and feel of claymation is pushed to new limits. However, a rather curt summary of this movie would be an avant-garde interpretive film that is overly abstract and subjective. Very much art house cinema material, this animated film has no clear message and provides the audience much to think about. However, due to the lack of coherency, it is difficult to apply a common theme or interpretive message throughout the narrative in its entirety. Despite the utter weirdness of the film, you will undoubtedly find yourself identifying with or interpreting various scenes in different ways; although, you may also ask yourself ""what the???"" after you leave the auditorium. It is definitely an animated film that is extremely artistic and serves as evidence that animation for adults can break from the confines of the living room or computer and find a place amongst other live-action avant-garde films. For fans of Cyndi Lauper, you will get a kick out of one of the scenes in particular, and also notice an analogy in the writing that goes along with her timeless hit ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.""Michael Stone is a successful businessman and author who is spending the weekend in Cincinnati to talk about his book on improving customer service in stores and other businesses. Along the way, he finds himself meeting many people who adore him and his work--an all too familiar encounter. Upon a chance meeting in the hallway of his hotel, he meets Lisa who captures his attention in a way that no-one has in a long time. Unfortunately, he must deal with personal and interpersonal conflict throughout his business trip and must decide how to handle and move-on with life.Well, that is pretty much it. There really isn't much more to say because of the very nature of this film. Much of what you may find enjoyable is the awkward romantic claymation scenes and the ability to gleam from the film whatever you may. One thing is for sure, whereas I find the film to be entirely too abstract and subjective, I can definitely appreciate it for pushing the boundaries of how one typically views or experiences claymation films."
168,Anomalisa,8,20 January 2016,"""Our time is limited, we forget that.""","Anomalisa is directed by Duke Johnson & Charlie Kaufman and stars a very small cast featuring the voice talents of David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noonan.Bored with a repetitive, monotonous life, Michael heads to Cincinnati, Ohio on a business trip. There he meets a special lady called Lisa. Firstly, I'd like to comment on the look of this film. The animation team have really poured their hearts into this project and for a feature that was funded entirely on Kickstarter, it falls right next to anything Aardman or Laika have created. Beautiful, smooth stop-motion animation with vibrant sets and detailed props. Although a very limited amount of locations or set pieces are used, the team have structured each scene with intricate eyes for movement and have given everything a soul, a life. The camera work is brilliantly simple yet complex when you really think about what is happening behind the camera. Facial expressions are handled with expertise and are extremely fluid. Every little detail matters, and this film is filled with them.Underneath the impeccable animation, is a meaningful story. It deals with a deep and rare disorder called The Fregoli Delusion, which, in simple terms, is where an individual sees everyone as the same person. This explains why only Noonan was cast for the extras and people the main protagonist, Michael, interacts with. Opening with an 'overture' of dialogue, all voiced by Noonan, it drops you straight into a world where, through Michael's eyes, everyone is the same. There are no exceptions. Until his stay at the fictional Fregoli Hotel, where he meets a young lady named Lisa. It's here that he starts to wonder, maybe some people are different. Using heartfelt comedy and emotional torment, Kaufman delivers strikingly in his screenplay and carefully presents to us how filmmaking should be handled. The voice acting in this film is racing with energy and strength. A staggering performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh as Lisa. After her role in The Hateful Eight, Leigh had to keep the bar raised high and she absolutely has, delightfully. Thewlis is perfect as Michael and serves the character well, very realistic and believable. Noonan voices so many strange yet wonderful characters that it's hard to keep track, but does a terrific job with ease. Although it's a little tricky to get used to for the first 20 minutes or so, I think his talent really shines. Original music by Carter Burwell is beautifully woven into this tragic story with exceptional skill. Using subtle string arrangements handled with love and care, resulting in a great overall tone for the film. The sound department also did a splendid job with making all of the visuals pop and come to life, again, every little detail is there, even if you don't notice it.Now, just because this is an animated film, don't be mistaken. It has some scenes of sexual behaviour and nudity. But even these scenes are handled with major care and are just as entertaining to watch, if only for the animation.Although I heavily enjoyed this film for its animation and voice acting, I did feel like the film could have had a more unique end. Also, it finished with me wanting more. Which isn't a bad thing, it's actually a good thing. However, just 15 minutes more could have satisfied me nicely. My verdict; Anomalisa is possibly the best animated feature this decade, and features 3 stellar performances by Thewlis, Leigh and Noonan. It deserves many awards and should definitely be hailed as one of the most human films ever made. A must-watch anomaly. Anomalisa, 8/10."
169,Anomalisa,,15 January 2016,"A Thought-Provoking Meditation On Depression, Delusion & Aching Human Needs!","From the genius mind behind Being John Malkovich, Adaptation & Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Anomalisa is Charlie Kaufman's sophomore effort as a director and also marks his first stint with animation filmmaking. And although the stop-motion animation is undeniably impressive, what leaves a more lasting mark is the story's surprising emotional depth & rich human themes.Based on Kaufman's play of the same name, Anomalisa tells the story of a famous self-help author who is crippled by the mundanity of his own life, is emotionally distant to everyone & is longing for a deep, meaningful conversation with anyone. But his negative view of life is hit by a positive light when he meets a fascinating stranger on a business trip who makes him feel like a whole different person.Written & co-directed by Charlie Kaufman, Anomalisa happens to be another engrossing tale from the crazy, mad & creative writer that brims with all his trademarks, be it the frustrated protagonist, themes of identity or its plot pierced by thin lines of fantasy. Packing his patented bizarreness, the film takes a trip down human misery, is allowed to unfold at its own pace, and manages to keep all its emotions achingly real.The stop-motion animation is another welcome delight for this animation technique is seldom seen in media anymore plus it's both visually pleasing & artistically fulfilling in this film's case. However, no matter how gorgeous its animation looks, the real winner is the script itself for Kaufman's story is emotionally resonant & thematically heavy, and the characters are wonderfully brought to life by excellent voice work from David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh & Tom Noonan.On an overall scale, Anomalisa is a thought-provoking meditation on depression, delusion & aching human needs that's filled with some strong, relatable & heart-wrenching moments yet in the end, it didn't cut as deep as I anticipated. The suddenness of its ending was very surprising at first but on a deeper inspection, Kaufman's latest is more about its titular character and the life-altering effect our clinically depressed author ends up having on her life despite the dull existence of his own. Ah, the irony of life!"
170,Anomalisa,6,15 January 2016,"smart, sad, and apparently simple","I expect something different, something smart, something deep, each time I am seeing a film written or (lately) directed by Charlie Kaufman. Many of his films are not one-time experiences, the second or later viewing brings new understanding and discovers of new layers under the one of the original story which is also not obvious or readable from the first time. This may be the case also with Anomalisa, which is also the reason that I am cautious in sharing my disappointment with this latest film of Kaufman, which seems to me to be the more obvious and less sophisticated work that he has made or written in the last two decades.The story is apparently simple. Michael Stone is a famous author of one of those successful 'How To ...' business books. He comes for one night in one of these mid-America metropolis that look so much one as the other, he checks into one of these hotels that that look so much one as the other, calls one an ex-girlfriend who is one of those women that look so much one as the other. We soon realize that all the persons he talks with have the same voice, that all women have a very look-alike appearance. Actually, if we pay attention and we know some psychology, Michael may suffer of the Fregoli delusion, a syndrome in which patients believe that other people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise. And the name of the hotel he checked-in is Hotel Fregoli! Or maybe the psychological condition is just a metaphor for broader human estrangement.All these until he meets Lisa. Or Anomaly-Lisa. Or Anomalisa. The woman who may be the Different One.I will not continue telling more in order to avoid spoilers, but rather refer on a few details to film-making. Stop-motion, the animation method used by Duke Johnson, and Charlie Kaufman provides a very special look to the film and shifts much of the expression and emotion to the modeled characters, sets, and lighting. All work well together, the faces seem like masks in a theater that reflects the reality but is also somehow different, and so is the surrounding combination of familiar and strange. We are in kind of a dream. yet the situation, characters, suffering is all well-known and very human.The second part of the story and its outcome, however, quite disappointed me.I had the feeling that too many smart ideas were invested in too small a story. But, as I said, it's a film by Charlie Kaufman, and I may have not gotten it all."
171,Anomalisa,9,14 May 2017,Heartwarming and with lovely stop motion,"Pure cinematic magic. Finely tuned. Lovely stop motion animations. Written and co- directed by Charlie Kaufman, it's an extraordinary vision. Based on a play by Kaufman - starring David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noon, who also voice the movie - ""Anomalisa"" (2015) is a bittersweet and humorous depiction of the loneliness and mundanity of life. In some ways, it feels more real than life itself."
172,Anomalisa,9,21 April 2017,A for Anomalisa,"Acclaimed Writer-Director Charlie Kaufman's films might not be for everyone, and they are an acquired taste; but one thing for sure is that Kaufman is an anomaly in so many filmmaking ways. Kaufman goes for the stop-motion animation in his movie ""Anomalisa"", which he co-directed with animation Director Duke Johnson. Anomalisa's protagonist is Michael Stone, a middle-aged motivational business speaker & author who travels to Cincinnati for a gig as a keynote speaker at a conference. Stone finds people and life in general very monotonous and with much sameness. But things go anomalistic when he meets Lisa, a depressed telemarketing representative who is attending the conference. Michael sees Lisa as a vibrant, standout woman and falls for her. His ""hands of Stone"" even get in Lisa's private parts. OK, that is enough. I will let you figure it out. But I do highly recommend to visit this eccentric, visionary film that had me quite engaged throughout its narrative. There is spectacular voice work from David Thewlis who voices Stone, Jennifer Jason-Leigh who voices Lisa, and Tom Noonan who voices everyone else. The animation was divine, and the score was right on. Kaufman's screenplay was a simplistic but original tour-de-force. And Johnson and him directed the hell out of ""Anomalisa"". Anomalisa! Anomalisa! Men have loved you!!! Hope women love it too, because it is in motion as a ""must see"" stop-motion animation treat. ***** Excellent"
173,Anomalisa,7,17 April 2017,One.,"The elements used to portray a pretty complex idea, came together quite artistically in this film, however, somehow, it still falls kind of short of being as poignant as it was perhaps meant to.Creatively, Anomalisa is spot on, and it is easy to see that thought went into putting all the pieces together to bring an idea to life. Sadly though, apart from it being not as moving as it could be, many scenes felt incredibly stretched out, which made the film feel even longer than it already felt.Though I give this film a 6.9/10, I do understand the acclaim it has received. It didn't quite reach out to me the way it was supposed to, but honestly, given the artistic integrity this film holds, I see how it could've hit home for anyone else.The praise and Oscar Nomination are well founded. The idea is fresh and well designed, however, the execution though good, maybe could've been better, or wasn't good enough, but also, was very smart."
174,Anomalisa,7,3 April 2017,Strangely Captivating,"I knew nothing about Anomalisa ahead of time. The first thing I had to figure out once the film started was why are all the animated characters except two were using the same voice. Once I got beyond that, I just watched in a kind of odd, mesmerized state.Nothing much happens for about the first 20 minutes. It is Michael Stone; a writer and motivational speaker, checking into a hotel in Cincinnati where he is to lecture at a conference the next day. He is a man who no longer has feelings for his wife, and has other serious personal problems. That evening he meets a couple of women who are there for the conference, know who he is and are subsequently infatuated by him. The three have drinks together at the hotel bar which leads to an overnight stay in his room by one of the women.For a short few hours Michael Stone truly believes he is in love with the woman, Lisa. He thinks his loneliness is over. But as he and the lady eat breakfast the next morning, he discovers that he is annoyed by some of her habits and just as quickly as he fell in love, he falls out of love. He will return home to the wife he no longer loves, and his son, his life unchanged.I think the unusual, stop-motion animation make it an interesting movie. I do not think the plot alone would make it a good movie and it is a good movie."
175,Anomalisa,10,16 March 2017,Kaufman you have Done it Again!,"Anomalisa is a beautifully executed piece of art. From the great Charlie Kaufman brings us a fantastic story, with pronominal characters, and exceptional animation. I honestly can't do this movie justice. All I can really say much more other then see this film as soon as you can!10/10"
176,Anomalisa,9,3 March 2017,Charlie Kaufman's writing hits all the right notes,"The only other experience I have had with Charlie Kaufman comes from one of my favorite films of all time - Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind. In Anomalisa he also tries his hand at directing as well, to great effect to be honest. However, that's not what I want to talk about.The writing in Anomalisa, alongside its beautiful animation, is what makes the film so interesting. It's an exploration of the psyche of a man who is driven to his wit's end by the mundane nature of everyday life. It seems innocuous and certainly seems as though it may be difficult to make a movie out of it, but here is where Kaufman shines. His script allows for wonderful pacing. It capitalizes on silences in ways other scripts may be tempted to fill the silence with dialogue. This silence also allows his characters space to breathe and develop in the audience's eyes. He knows the backstory to these characters, the audience doesn't, so the difficulty comes at how to get that across without too much exposition. Kaufman does this by focusing on Michael Stone's loneliness and gradually drawing in details about his personal life, slowly transforming how the audience sees him throughout the course of the picture. It really is a wonderful character study of how mundanity takes its toll on our lives, and it is most certainly worth your time."
