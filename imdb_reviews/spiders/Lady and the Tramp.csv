0,Lady and the Tramp,7,2 June 2002,Simple and often lovely,"Fairy tale about the romance between two dogs from opposite sides of the tracks gets colorful, warm, old-fashioned Disney treatment. Cinemascope cartoon unfolds with valentine-like flair, all the ribbons and bows are in place, yet the requisite cutesy flourishes and manipulation inevitably turn up (one dog, thought to have been killed, shows up LIMPING in the next scene!). Yet, it's hard to complain when the rest of the pieces fall into place so snugly. The plot is, by turns, comfortably predictable and still pleasingly reassuring, though a bit heavy with incidental chatter. The Peggy Lee music is delightful, and the ""Bella Notte"" sequence alone, with the spaghetti, breadsticks and the drippy candle, is simply superb. *** from ****"
1,Lady and the Tramp,,19 March 2001,One of the Greats,"I grew up watching this movie. I consider it a wonderful movie for both children and adults to watch. While many of today's animated Disney movies are aimed at kids, this movie is from a time where adults were primarily the target audience. This movie lacks the 'kiddie' humor and tells a wonderful tale of genuine emotion and compassion. The love story between two non-human characters removes most bias that we automatically impose upon human characters. I feel that few movies will ever match this one in quality."
2,Lady and the Tramp,10,22 January 2000,The Life and Loves of our Best Friends,"There is nothing as wonderful as the wag of a dog's tale.  The writers, actors and animators, together with Disney magic, capture the unique and limitless variety of personalities that exist in the canine world.   This film takes these wonderful canine characters and shows the world from their perspective. The adorable footage of Lady as a puppy reminds me of the behavior of my own hounds when they were pups.    The beautiful ""Park Avenue"" Lady grows up and falls for the happy-go-lucky, vagabond, Tramp. Add a dog-hating aunt, a baby, some cats, some rats and the adventure is complete.  The songs sung from the dog pound together with those sung by the wicked Siamese cats are the most purely fun of any Disney animation. The song sung at the lover's romantic Italian dinner brings a tear to the eye. Finally, Lady and the Tramp share a spaghetti noodle that leads to one of the most memorable kisses in Hollywood history.  This is a wonderful film that will be enjoyed for generations."
3,Lady and the Tramp,8,14 December 2003,A CLASSIC,"If this film isn't a classic, I don't know what is! This is a great story about two dogs who fall in love, although they're from different sides of the railroad tracks, so to speak. These dogs act more human than many humans do. It's heartwarming, humorous and just plain clean family entertainment! This is a film that has stood the test of time and passed with flying colors. This is one to BUY and keep! So what are you waiting for? Go buy it!"
4,Lady and the Tramp,8,23 October 2005,Cute/Romantic Canine Film,"Lady and the Tramp, one of my favourite childhood movies, goes down as a classic animation and one that I am sure is enjoyed by children today. Who doesn't like watching cute animals with large, kind eyes? Lady and the Tramp is about love and sacrifice, bringing together a posh female dog with a homeless stray, who is sexy in his own right. Also included are the memorable Siamese trouble-making cats (Peggy Lee) and the wonderful candle-lit scene where are lovable heros enjoy spaghetti. This film should be enjoyed and treasured for years to come. It's gone down in Disney and film history. Although made for children, there isn't any reason why adults cannot enjoy this film."
5,Lady and the Tramp,,26 April 2001,"Charm, humor, songs, great animation...what more do you need?","One of the few Disney cartoons at this period not based on a famous piece of literature--so at least no one can complain that it doesn't do justice to the original! It's an unpretentious little gem, told from the viewpoint of the animals and against interesting backgrounds with superb animation and vocal work. Cat lovers may find it painful to watch how sinister the two Siamese cats are depicted--but not if they have a sense of humor. Actually, the 'Siamese Cat Song' is one of the highlights of Peggy Lee's novelty numbers. 'Bella Notte' and other simple melodies are integrated nicely into the plot with satisfying results. This was the first Disney cartoon made in Cinemascope so the artists had to fill a broader landscape for the camera to photograph. And yet, the transfer to video on VHS format is extremely well handled--you don't feel you're missing anything. I believe the film is also available in letterbox but I find the VHS print I own to be more than satisfactory. Delightful Disney classic for young and old alike."
6,Lady and the Tramp,,16 May 2003,An all-time classic favorite!,"""Lady and the Tramp"" is indeed one of my all-time favorite Disney movies. I just love every single bit of it! The story, the characters, the music, the stunning animation style...everything is amazingly done!
This is exactly what today's Disney flicks have been lacking- they don't recapture the spirit and magic of the original Disney masterpieces like this movie and the other Disney classics such as ""Bambi"", ""The Aristocats"", and ""The Fox and the Hound"", except for contemporaries like ""The Lion King"", ""Toy Story"", ""Tarzan"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""Mulan"", which are still well-set up. Okay, back to ""Lady and the Tramp"". This movie deserves ten out of ten stars, and those of you who haven't seen it yet have gotta watch it.  It's not presented only for the youngsters, but also for those who are young at heart. If you really enjoy it as much as I do, don't miss the astounding follow-up to the original in the delightful ""Scamp's Adventure""!"
7,Lady and the Tramp,,3 July 2002,Outstanding Love Story.,"Yet another winner from Disney about an upper-class dog who falls for a mutt from the streets. The timeless love story works just as well on a feature-length cartoon as it does with live-action fare. The animation is first-rate, the characters are fun and the songs will stick with you long after the movie is seen. Great entertainment for all ages. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
8,Lady and the Tramp,,17 October 2005,A fab soundtrack,"Peggy Lee was a national treasure. What an amazing thing that she wrote most of the music for this movie, but only in old age did she receive credit. I agree that issues of class seem merely consistent with the era, but consider that the flavor of the day was vanilla. So in those days going out for Italian was a walk on the wild side (unless you grew up in Brooklyn)! Then an upper-crust girl marries a boy of mixed race origins?! And it's clear from the dog pound scene that Peg ""got around"" (just look at her hair!), nevertheless, she was valued and respected among the dogs. Yes, the film is hokey. But rats are evil. And the soundtrack is outstanding."
9,Lady and the Tramp,8,22 January 2006,She's from the leash and license set... he's footloose and collar free!,"''Lady and the Tramp'' is one of the most adorable movies from Disney, and until I read in IMDb, I would never guess that it is from 1955! I always imagined it to be from the 70's, I don't know exactly why. Lady is a cute golden cocker spaniel that was a present from '' Dear''(the husband) to '' Darling'(the wife) at Christima's. She was threaded very well since she was a puppy and is an adorable dog that loves to spend her time with her owners. Two of her best friends and neighbors are Jock and Trusty. One day, Tramp, a god without a breed and without a license goes to the wrong side of the town (the rich side) and ends up meeting Lady. She stays scared with his lifestyle, but at the same time she could not avoid fallen in love with the experienced dog. They fall in love at the same time that Lady is having problems at her home ( Darling is pregnant, so, nobody in the home really cares about her as before). But her love with Tramp will have bad consequences, being the first one being caught by the Dog Catcher and knowing more things about Tramp that she actually would like..."
10,Lady and the Tramp,,10 October 2003,"My favourite Disney film.Cute,funny and full of enjoyable songs.","On my list of favourite Disney films,Lady and Tramp is at the very top.I just love it.The songs are some of the most enjoyable Disney has ever composed.The film is cute but not in a soppy,drippy way,like say Bambi.Bambi is a classic,but it is too sentimental.I love the song Bella Note.We used to have the video but then chucked it out.After a while,I felt that I had to see it again.So I looked in the library.Would you believe it,they seemed to have every Disney film you could think of except this one,I mean why????????I had to request it from another library and then wait a week for it to arrive(sigh)But it was well worth the wait and I loved seeing it again.Barbra Luddy and Verna Felton who voice characters in this film also voice many other Disney characters.They were both in Sleeping Beauty as well.Sadly they are both dead.Out of 5 stars.Lady and the Tramp deserves 5.It will always be a classic and one everybody will love.Shame about the sequel."
11,Lady and the Tramp,10,28 February 2006,Two dogs in love,"But it's a lot more than that. For 56 years now, ""Lady and the Tramp"" has won a devoted following based on a love story that could have worked out just as well with live-action and a romance, but here we have it with two dogs - a pampered cocker spaniel and a street-wise mutt. ""Lady and the Tramp"" contains the kind of innocence and love story that is unfamiliar with our times today, and it is good to see a masterwork from a bygone era.I was only a kid when I first saw ""Lady and the Tramp"" but I still remember that famous kiss scene, you know the one where the two leads are having a beautifully romantic spaghetti dinner and they take hold of a single string of pasta and consume it, unknowingly bringing their faces together in an unwitting kiss. It's remained with me up until now.I'm a sucker for love stories and ""Lady and the Tramp"" works, despite its animal characters and Walt Disney family-friendly touch. Lady is the cocker spaniel, who is a gift to a woman from her husband. Lady adores her surroundings and receives the requited love of her owners and a nice home. Six months later, that love hasn't diminished and she is a newly licensed pet. But it's misplaced when she learns that her owners are expecting a child, and suddenly Lady has been unwittingly pushed aside to make room for a new bundle of joy.From the wrong side of the tracks, it's the street-wise Tramp, a known lady-killer who wins Lady's heart after saving her from other common street dogs. They really hit it off, climaxing with the aforementioned romantic dinner and a wonderful animated shot of the moon from a lover's point. Along for the ride are Trusty, a hound dog with a busted sniffer; Jock, a Scottish terrier; and Si and Am, the two sneaky Siamese cats belonging to the husband's snooty aunt.Directed by Clyde Geronimi and Wilfred Jackson and featuring the voices of Peggy Lee, Barbara Luddy and Larry Roberts, the newly restored DVD version with the Platinum Series is the one to get and cherish. I got mine at a Best Buy store today to take advantage of this limited release, and to win a free Tramp plush toy.I would guess that time has been good to ""Lady and the Tramp,"" if a love story of this pedigree is truly worth the praise due to it. I would recommend this Disney classic to any possible female romantic interest as part of our date... if I could land one.10/10"
12,Lady and the Tramp,9,24 November 2004,The ultimate spaghetti dinner movie,"God, who doesn't remember the romantic scene of the Lady and the Tramp? Ah, spaghetti has never been as sexy. OK, OK, I know that this is Disney. This is one of my favorites. It's a great one. As far as Disney movies go, I would recommend this. Disney lovers have to watch this. It's very naturally addicting. And the music is so wonderful to listen too, and the characters are so lovable. This is one of the best Disney movies by far. I miss movies like this. Just see this movie. It's just too good to miss. This is for the kids and the adults. I would recommend it for a family night for sure.9/10"
13,Lady and the Tramp,10,14 January 2011,Bella. One Of Cinema's Best Told Love Stories.,"i personally feel Disney's 'Lady and the Tramp' is one of cinema's very best and most memorable love stories. and i'm not alone in that opinion. not only were the online reviews almost 99% positive and enthusiastic, but the film has been voted in numerous polls as having the best screen kiss/favorite romantic screen scene. how often do we see the iconic image of lady and tramp eating the spaghetti dinner at Tony's? it's pretty much the standard image represented in most articles or pieces concerning film and romance.'Lady and the Tramp' is also one of the best told of cinema's love stories and one of classic Disney's best scripted animated features. there is so much in this story that is so memorable and clever and filled with humor that it seems to lack for anything. it also tells a story that has as much depth to it as romantic sentiment.it also has a almost startlingly realistic observation of animals and humans and their interactions with each other. yes, the dogs talk and sing, but so much of their behavior is also very well observed canine nuances. anyone who's ever had a dog will tell you how convincing the animals are in this. i personally had a Cocker myself so i can tell you from experience how real and convincing Lady seems.you can mess up and botch dog illustrations. anyone that's seen the cute, well intentioned but routinely envisioned 'All Doggies Go to Heaven', knows this. no one can pretend that 'All Dogs' even attempted realism.but it isn't just simply a matter of illustration or graphics that make the animals real. it's often the situations and the way they are done that conveys realism so well. the Siamese kits may look a little cartoony and exaggerated, but anyone who has ever owned a cat can tell you that they act like that. especially when small birds and fish are involved in the scenario. and the relationship between dogs and humans are told through an interesting sense of perspective. you rarely see the human's faces up close but instead constantly view them from the dog's eye level. the birth of Darling's baby resonates great beauty and a sense of the human soul. and anyone that knows young married couples, they often start off with small dogs and work their way up to babies. all of this feels so real and so very human.as far as a work of animation, this is probably Disney's most polished and flawlessly perfect of all his classics. even in some of Disney's finest classics there can sometimes be flaws or ""rough spots"" in the animation and illustration. not with 'Lady and the Tramp'. it is probably Disney's most flawlessly executed hand animated feature. not to mention a perfect blend of all elements including story and songs. Peggy Lee's songs are just about Disney's best.a masterpiece of hand animation, romantic sentiment and of character development, the original 50's Disney classic deserves every bit of love, praise and attention it's been given over the decades."
14,Lady and the Tramp,8,15 May 2014,Among the sweetest Disney love stories,"Though Disney gets flack for ""unrealistically"" portraying romance with their use of the love-at-first-sight trope (because psychological realism is a thing in fairy tales, right?), I would say they made two genuinely romantic films in their animated canon: Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Lady and the Tramp (1955). These films feature protagonists who fall in love over an extended period and whose opposing personality traits create an interesting ""yin and yang"" sort of chemistry.Lady and the Tramp (1955) is one of Disney's finest movies of the 1950s. The art is not as openly artsy as the films of the Golden Age (1937-1942) were, but the less art-conscious style fits the nostalgic view of turn-of-the-century America which the film is set in. The music is charming and the characters are all memorable. (Unfortunately, the Siamese cats belonging to Aunt Sara are memorable due to how offensive they are; those two are one of only a few aspects which mar the film.) Overall, this is a sweet, simple love story. It's not thought-provoking, but it is great entertainment."
15,Lady and the Tramp,8,17 July 2000,Good movie.,"I just wanted to comment on something said in an earlier post here.  One user brought up that he or she felt the movie was too ""middle-class"".  I disagree.  First, the movie is about dogs, not humans, that's why you don't see a bunch of humans in the backgrounds.  Second, just because a neighborhood is middle class doesn't mean it's boring.  How can you call any neighborhood with characters like Jock and Trusty boring?  The reason why you see such a middle class neighborhood is so that it can be contrasted to Tramps poorer neighborhood.Speaking of the Tramp, I think the movie goes well beyond depicting Tramp as poor.  He sleeps in alleyways and has to beg for food. How poorer can you get?  I certainly think the culture shock angle works just fine.  The reason why Tramp may seem to have it ""easy"" and not really be poor is becuase he dosen't allow his poorness to control his life.  You don't have to be rich to enjoy life, and in fact, having less can often enrich your life. Tramp has been able to live a less restricted life than Lady and it shows.  He's allowed to be more carefree and enjoy the small things in life.  I don't see how anyone can say the movies world is one where no one is poor.  It's a world where just because guys like Tramp are poor, doesn't mean they have to be miserable.As for the film being to glossy, I don't understand that.  It's supposed to look glossy, it's an animated feature.  Would you rather it looked ugly and scratched up? And where does the movie infer that real tramps are herded off the street and everything is clean?  That's not true, there certainly is plenty of grime and squalor in the movie too.  And if it was true, Tramp wouldn't have been in the movie.  Besides, it's supposed to be a cute and fun movie about dogs, not a Charles Dickinesian expose on poverty.
That being said, at it's heart it's simply a well animated and charming movie.  Just enjoy it for what it is."
16,Lady and the Tramp,8,22 July 2017,A Dog's Tale,"Many Disney features are adaptations of previously existing stories. Lady and the Tramp was the first Disney feature to be based on an original story. Like Peter Pan and Alice In Wonderland, this was one of the projects shelved and then resumed due to WWII. Like many of the best Disney and MGM shorts featuring house pets made years prior, this is told and animated from the dog's perspective. The audience only sees a few glimpses of the human characters, and we're unsure of their actual names. The main heroine Lady and the hero Tramp are an unlikely match as they come from opposite backgrounds, but circumstances bring them together for a romantic adventure. I like how the dog's characters (and in some cases dialects) are defined by their breeds (i.e. Jock the Scottish terrier having a Scottish accent and feisty personality). Surprisingly, this film has still maintained its status as a beloved classic despite ethnic stereotypes of Asians, Italians, Irish, etc. These kind of elements, Disney and other media have otherwise tried to censor. I wonder how the features in the Disney animated canon with controversial sequences have largely remained available and well publicized. I like how the setting is at the turn of the last century, likely within the collective memory at the time of release. The film doesn't specifically state when, but I would say early 1910's, as there mostly horse carriages, but a few cars. As far as post-war features, this is generally considered to be one of the best. The spaghetti scene is one of the most iconic scenes in cinema. There are three nicely executed climatic scenes, two of them back to back at the end of the film. I still have fond recollections of when I first saw it some 25 years ago as a small child."
17,Lady and the Tramp,6,26 June 2014,A Real Happy Tail-Wagger,"Bow-Wow-Wow! - And - Arf! Arf! Arf! You ever heard of ""puppy-love""? Well, LADY AND THE TRAMP is the ideal movie for puppy lovers, and dog lovers, alike.Without any doubt in my mind, this film is definitely one of Disney Studios' most endearing animated features of all. Its story concerns a rakish mongrel named Tramp who heroically helps out a pedigreed canine named Lady who has found herself in a mighty tight jam - And, as these things so often happen, Tramp gallantly dances Lady right into a sweet, little romance that's well-worth barking about.Throughout the delightful course of LADY AND THE TRAMP, elements of high-adventure and drama are quite masterfully blended together with the sheer joy and amusement of comedy and music.LADY AND THE TRAMP would be Disney Studios' 15th animated feature film and the first to be produced with the dazzling effects of wide-screen Cinema-Scope."
18,Lady and the Tramp,7,8 July 2007,Just the right pedigree. Disney classic.,"LADY and the TRAMP is one of the most underrated, but endearing Walt Disney animated features. Memorable music and purebred fun. A high-bred and pampered cocker spaniel, Lady(Barbara Luddy), learns to be adventurous and carefree when she meets Tramp(Larry Roberts), a raffish mutt from across the tracks. Spending the night on a hill overlooking town; begging for bones; sneaking into the zoo; running from the dog catcher and that memorable spaghetti and meatball dinner. Other characters in this fantasy are: Trusty and Jock, Darling, Si and Am. Lush backgrounds and ""He's A Tramp"" sung by Peggy Lee help make this film one to be enjoyed by the whole family. Others lending voices to characters are Bill Thompson, Stan Freberg, Bill Baucom and Miss Lee."
19,Lady and the Tramp,7,17 June 2006,Spaghetti lovers if you please!,"I like Disney movies and I like this story of an upper class Cocker Spaniel who becomes saved by a mutt and then falls in love. The music by Peggy Lee is great and I said that if I were a dog in this movie, I would be the little gray dog named Trixie.I loved the Spaghetti scene but I thought that the Italian cooks were too stereotype. I didn't like the scene in the pound, made me cry. When the cats frame Lady for messing up the living room and Aunt Sara comes along and comforts them, I thought that it was pretty funny.It is what it is, a Disney movie and I have liked it since I was a puppy."
20,Lady and the Tramp,7,4 February 2014,"Very enjoyable, if unmemorable, Disney effort","During the early 1950s Disney was making some excellent animated features with 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Peter Pan', Lady and the Tramp followed those films and proved to be another good film from the studio. After the very large and fantasy orientated feel of those two films, Lady and the Tramp moves towards a much more grounded style which benefits the film as well as Disney's output by adding a little more variety to their work at the time. I don't think it is quite as good in Disney terms as some of their other features.The plot centres on Lady who is a pampered Cocker Spaniel adored by her owners. Things start to change for her when the couple have a baby and she begins to fall out of favour in the household. At the same time she comes across a mongrel named Tramp, despite not getting along at firs the two build up a strong bond and he shows her what life would be like if they lived free. The story is about as straight forward as it gets. I think that takes some of the impact out of the story as you kind of know where it is going to go and how things are going to end up. But in fairness I like how laid-back the story was, it wasn't trying to do anything but tell a charming story and it succeeds in doing that to be fair.There is a lot of good things about the film. The animation for a start is fantastic, as you would expect from Disney. The film has a very soft look and uses very bright colours that give the upper class housing areas a rich gleam. It a good choice as this fits the films aims more than some of the more vivid animation that Disney had been using prior to it. The softer colours also work for the night scenes in making some beautiful looking scenery.The characters are very enjoyable. I was worried that Lady would be presented as being too full of herself, but they do a good job in making her likable. Her plight is something that is understandable and you begin to feel for her, her soft and sensitive nature really does win you over quickly. Tramp comes off well as more of a lovable rogue type. He has all the great features needed for a good lead seeing as he's caring, witty and has the right amount of street smarts. Jock is very amusing, he's excellently voiced by veteran Bill Thompson doing a great Scottish accent and him constantly calling Lady 'Lassie' is quite funny. Trusty was another very fun supporting role, always forgetting what he is talking about and reciting stories of old. He comes off as a reassuring elderly figure and that makes him quite endearing. Jim and Darling were okay, but nothing special but then again they aren't the focus.The film does contain some differences to the formula that make it enjoyable. I really like the fact that Lady and Tramp don't get along straight away, it gets rid of the clichés like love at first sight and it is nicely more real in how they spend more time together before deciding they're meant to be with each other. I also think that having these things from the dogs perspective is very smart, like the fact Lady thinks her owners are 'Jim Dear' and 'Darling as that's what they call each other or her confusion at how worked up Jim is getting over the birth of the baby. There were some exciting scenes too, Tramp's fight with a rat and the climax itself are very well done pieces. As noted I do like the more laid-back tone as it allows for more time to be invested into the characters and makes sure that the story itself isn't rushed. I think this made the characters more engaging and made you want to know what was going to happen. The music is also very good. The 'We Are Siamese' song is known by everyone and rightly so as it is a fun tune. The song 'Bella Notte' in particular is very pleasant, and of course the image of Lady and Tramp eating the Spaghetti accompanying it is now seen as iconic.I think that the films biggest weakness is the fact that it lacks anything that memorable. As said the story is somewhat obvious, even if it makes changes to the norm, and there isn't really anything that you haven't seen before. Although I do like the more laid-back tone, at times you can feel that the film is affected by the lack of a villain and the lack of any big set-pieces taking place which takes any edge of proceedings. I think that the film can come off as a series of moments due to the way it is told and though most of it is interesting, it isn't as gripping as say the moments in 'Alice in Wonderland' so it's more liable to become a little dull in some areas.On the whole I'd say Lady and the Tramp is another entertaining film from Disney. It does have a lot of charm to it and the story is told in a fairly smart fashion in that it at least tries to make a rather tried idea fresh. As usual there are plenty of amusing pieces, the characters are very fun and the animation looks fantastic. There are certain areas where it lacks somewhat, but never enough to harm the overall quality of the film too much. It isn't a Disney film that I will be watching over and over, but taken for what it is worth and it is an effortlessly enjoyable film."
21,Lady and the Tramp,8,14 January 2014,Well constructed animated feature,"There have been plenty of Dog films made in the history of movies but there is only one that truly captures what it's like between the pampered and stray collarless life of man's best friend. Of course, during the middle of the 20th century, Disney had already a well established reputation of making wonderfully animated feature family films so it's obvious that the mouse house would tackle a story dealing with the pets we have loved and cared about for centuries.The story follows lady, a dog who is given as a Christmas gift between a couple. Of course, like any newborn, they have no idea how to take care of themselves and what their limits are, but that is all established at the beginning. As time passes, we see the growth of Lady as she lives her normal life. That is, until the couple who own her decide to have a baby. This is where things become confusing. Lady begins to receive less and less attention allowing her to believe that she isn't loved anymore. But then, a stray dog comes into her life and gives her an experience she wouldn't expect. What's it like to be free without a collar.Viewers will enjoy the contrast to how these two dogs live their lives because it's easily relatable. What's even more interesting is to see how both parties are content with what they have. It's not like one was longing for the other - not at all. It just so happened they met at the right time and that's where the magic lies. I do have to knit pick at some of human characters though. Their behavior is so easily turned on and off that it seems inhuman. There are also some subplots like the dogs in the pound. What happened to them at the end? It didn't have closure.But the voice actors do an excellent job at their characters. The animation is still great too. Lady's structure with her ears make her look so lovable it's difficult to resist. But my favorite actor was Dal McKennon who played a few roles. Just remember, he's the man who voiced Gumby. He's the man! Also Oliver Wallace's soundtrack to the film was well performed too. It carried a main theme for the characters and even had Lady sing one of her own songs. That's rare for an early Disney film. But it was nice none the less.Disney's story of when two dogs from different worlds collide is cute and contains a lot of charm. The animation and music also work well. The human counterparts are a little weird though."
22,Lady and the Tramp,9,17 October 2013,Wonderful Disney Romance Classic!,"This is a beautifully made 15th full-length animated feature film from Walt Disney - a tale about a cocker spaniel named Lady from an upscale neighborhood that meets a stray dog (dubbed the Tramp in the movie). While Lady leads a sheltered life, Tramp is carefree and adventurous. He takes Lady out to see the world and they both fell in love in the process.It's a movie filled with adventure and romance - a film for all ages and definitely has that special Disney touch. The music is rich in harmony; the song ""Bella Notte"" is one of the most soothing and magnificent love songs ever recorded and performed in a motion picture. The chemistry between Lady and the Tramp reminds you of an old-fashion romance - something special that leads to true love. The Spaghetti scene at the dinner table is one of the most iconic movie moments in cinema history.This is definitely one of the best romantic motion pictures and one of the best features from Disney.Grade A"
23,Lady and the Tramp,10,17 June 2013,The Disney classic that will wake up your inner adult ...,"""Lady and the Tramp"" opens with the following quotation: ""In the whole history of the world there is but one thing that money can not buy to wit"" And no, for once it's not about love we're talking, the 'one thing' that is so priceless, is simply 'the wag of a dog's tail'. And if you happen to disagree with that statement, watching ""Lady and the Tramp"" is the most likely experience to prove you wrong, for there is probably nothing more sincere than the secular relationship between man and his best friend: dog.But ""Lady and the Tramp"" is definitely not a human-centered movie; it mostly focuses on the relationships within the dog's world, starting with the iconic romance between Lady, the sweet and timid Cocker spaniel and the Tramp, the free-spirited and happy-go-lucky stray mutt. What's so fascinating in ""Lady and the Tramp"" is that it transplants all the characteristics of the human world, such as class barriers, love, intolerance or ethnic differences, into the animal world. Still, the only reason we don't end up believing that animals behave like humans is because humans remain present nonetheless, and dogs are either depicted as helpers or victims of humans.The story opens with Lady, a cute little puppy offered as a Christmas gift to 'Darling' by her husband Jim 'Dear'. The owners' names, besides the fact that their faces are rarely shown, accentuate the impression that we're watching the film from the dogs' perspectives, and in Lady's case, she's such a significant part of the family that she refers to her Masters by using their endearments. The film starts by showing Lady acting like a real dog through the irresistible silent sequence where she tries to get herself in her masters' bed, pushing the door, howling in despair, before finally triumphing over the stairs, and getting in the bed for just 'one' night, which the subsequent ellipse cleverly contradicts.Lady is then 1-year old, she got a new expensive collar she proudly shows to her two neighbors and friends, Jock, a Scottish terrier with a fitting accent, and Trusty, an old bloodhound, who lost his sense of smell. Rather than obligatory supporting characters, Jock and Trusty are treated with depth and substance, behaving with a honorable protective instinct toward their young neighbor. Meanwhile, we also meet the Tramp, who starts behaving like a dog, begging for scraps from his old friend the restaurant owner Tony and then releasing two friends from the dog pound's truck. ""Lady and the Tramp"" is the cohabitation between two universes, dogs from human perspective and vice versa.This device leads to the fundamental basis that would drive the whole film's narrative: misunderstanding. Lady fears she's coldly treated by her owners because she did something wrong, she's finally comforted by Jock and Trusty who understand that the owners are simply waiting for a baby. Tramp makes his entrance, preparing Lady for the worse: ""when the baby moves in, the dog moves out"" but after a fantastic pregnancy-montage, Lady finally grows fond of the baby and understands she still has a place in the family. Sadly, the second misunderstanding causes the annoying Aunt Sarah to believe that Lady, who just clashed with her trouble-making Siamese cats, is a threat for the baby, and buy her a muzzle.It's a sad thing that only a human with a capability to love dogs can understand the meaning of a dog's bark. But it's much worse for Tramp who's treated like a dangerous animal, while only a dog's perspective can show his true nature, gentle and sensitive. Ironically, when at the end, Trusty and Jock understood that Tramp never meant harm; Jock says ""we mistreated him"", as if they were so alienated by their human upbringing they became as flawed and prejudiced as men. Then the two dogs, draining their force and courage from their ancestral instincts, decides to save one of their own, for one of the film's most dramatic moments, characterized by Trusty's poignant howl.And Jock and Trusty's realization are ours, too. The dog pound is probably one of the most upsetting and disturbing scenes ever, featuring little puppies, howling and weeping dogs behind fences, this sequence alone shows the true measure of human cruelty, in contrast with dog's most defining quality: fidelity and capability for love. And this love, whether for human, babies or dogs, originates one of the most romantic, if not the most, love story in Disney's or Cinema's history, reaching a paroxysm during the iconic Spaghetti-scene. This scene is probably one of Disney's greatest moments and magnificently sums up the film's, not that dogs can behave like humans, but that they can reveal the best of our own humanity.""Lady and the Tramp"" is one of the most endearing Disney classics, hitting a sensitive in any human heart, a film that would inspire to any child the urge to have a dog, and to share with him this genuine complicity. And after watching the film again, after 20 years, I realize how particularly adult and mature it is. It doesn't have a memorable villain, although the rat is pretty terrifying, it doesn't have much of a plot, but rather deals with very sensitive matters such as pregnancy, parenthood, and even some subtle issues you wouldn't find in other Disney movies. And I guess it's mostly due to the fact that the film was based on an original screenplay, deprived from any fairy-tale material, that allowed the writers to make a film, appealing for children, but quite thought-provoking for an adult audience.The film is dedicated to all dogs, ""be they Ladies or Tramps"" and in a way, it's an encouragement for us, humans, to realize that humanity doesn't only apply for our relationships and communication with humans, and maybe the wag of dog's tail is the closest expression of 'humanity' a dog would ever show."
24,Lady and the Tramp,8,18 April 2013,4th of of 8 in the Silver Era,"Over two years after the release of the hit Peter Pan, they went back to cuddly dogs with Lady and the Tramp.The story of this 1955 movie is not as action-packed as its previous films. It is about a dog named Lady who is scared of being neglected after her owners have a baby. The owner's Aunt Sarah comes to watch over the baby, and Lady runs away, as Aunt Sarah wants to shield her mouth. She bumps into a street dog named Tramp and they have a day full of fun and romance.The characters in this story are the most complex characters in a WDAS film yet. Lady is a naive dog who wants to please and to be love by her owners, and is scared about being unwanted and loved. She is also scared of what dogs will think of her. Tramp is a dog who was abandoned by his owners and is living a full life; he apparently is very experienced when it comes to romance. Jock and Trusty are entertaining and supportive friends, Aunt Sarah is just an old bat who wants the best for her family, and has a big hatred for dogs, and the Siamese cats are sneaky, conniving trouble makers.The songs in this movie has a more sophisticated sound than the other soundtracks. ""He's A Tramp"" is a catchy jazz-like song, ""We are Siamese"" is a smooth, quiet edgy song, and the theme song ""Bella Notte"" has Italian written all over it. The instrumentals and the vocals has the European romantic tone that makes this movie legendary, and making the legendary spaghetti scene legendary as well.The animation in this movie is fantastic (as all the animation in the 50s). It does not look like it was made in the early-mid 1950s, and it has kind of a model feel to it. The movement and design of the dogs are so realistic and flawless. I like the artistic choice thy made with not showing the human faces, and keeping it in the sky's eye view.This film has the best animation, the most complex characters yet, a simple yet complex story, and cute (but not overly cute) charm. If you like dogs, romance, little action, and a nostalgic family film, this movie is perfect. It has a lot of adult content that will flow over children's head, but it is not bold."
25,Lady and the Tramp,,9 July 2000,Disney and dogs,"Through out the history of Walt Disney the company made allot of films that had dogs in the star role. Both live-action as animated. The best known, and most populair ""Disney dog"" is of course Pluto. Lady and the Tramp is the most romantic Disney movie with dogs, the story of the street wise Tramp and the cocky Lady living an adventure that lead them through the city from the rich neighborhood too the famous ""Bella Notte"" alley. Is, to me, one of the most romantic Disney features ever made.I'm still wondering what ever happened with the plans for Lady and the Tramp 2.I recommend the movie for kids but also couples looking for a romantic video/DVD to spend the evening on the couch cuddled up."
26,Lady and the Tramp,8,13 August 1999,Doggeees!!,"Dogs are adorable.  Maybe it's cheap of a film-maker to simply rely on this fact; maybe someone who manages to make, say, cockroaches seem adorable deserves much more credit; but I don't care.  Doggeees!There are also these two Siamese cats.  Cats - boo, hiss!  This film demonstrates the underlying evil and hypocrisy of, if not all cats, then at least the Siamese variety, in a scene that ought to be required viewing for all cat people.  THIS IS WHAT YOUR CATS ARE REALLY LIKE.  Don't ever forget it.If the film has a flaw it's that it's so relentlessly upper middle class. Lady, Jock and Trusty live in a VERY rich neighbourhood - and, it must be said, a very boring one.  The story revolves around culture shock, as Lady falls in love with Tramp, a vagabond dog of no fixed address.  Yet how much culture shock is there, really?  Tramp also has it rather easy, because this appears to be a world in which no-one is really poor.  In a famous scene, Tramp introduces Lady to what was, in 1910, ethnic food: that's about it. This could be why many of Disney's 1950s movies feel much too glossy.  It could also explain a feeling that others have reported on seeing ""Lady and the Tramp"", that the backgrounds, however much detail there may be, look bare and empty - because this is a world in which REAL tramps are herded off the street, where nothing is left lying around for so much as an instant, and where everything is new.Despite this it's a good-looking movie, with well-drawn dogs.  (Doggeees!) Lady has such soft brown eyes, such velvety long ears ...  And there are signs, towards the end, that life may have a seamier side, as Tramp demonstrates that he must have picked up SOME skills from a genuinely rough past.  The story picks up a good deal towards the end.  To get the most out of it, though, it's best to ignore the culture-shock aspect, and think of it primarily as a story about dogs.  (Doggeees!)"
27,Lady and the Tramp,10,3 August 2004,great movie,"Lady and the tramp i think is a fantastic animated movie. This movie was made in 1955, about a lady dog and his tramp, i liked every minute of this movie, 46 years after this movie, Lady and the tramp ii: Scamp's adventure was released in 2001, continuing what was left off after the end of lady and the tramp. I really liked how lady first became a puppy and she yapped yapped yapped when she was on her own and she wanted to be with her mother and father (the parents who bought the little puppy) and at the end she was allowed up the stairs and sleep with the parents, she was no longer alone after that, then soon she grew up and became a young lady. I give this movie 10 out of 10."
28,Lady and the Tramp,8,13 February 2016,A lovely film for a lovely Bella Notte,"Lady and the Tramp is a romantic tale told through the eyes of both a dog well off and a dog from the streets. But it's romantic not only in relation to love and affection. It's also a boldly romanticized look at turn of the century American life, set in a small idealistic all-American town, much like Disneyland's Main Street. It's a vibrant film, although somewhat non-traditional for Disney, full of lovable characters that are beautifully framed and extraordinarily animated.Lady and Tramp are almost like Romeo and Juliet, without quite as much drama. They come from very opposing ideals, or sides of the tracks, which shows a nice contrast in personality and atmosphere. As they see life from the other's perspective, their characters grow both independently and together, and although neither character is perfect, they seem to work together in just the right way. It's not about finding someone who fits into your world, it's about finding someone that you are OK to compromise with. The two have a great chemistry together, like old Hollywood stars. Supporting characters such as Lady's friends Jaques and Trusty help to bring on emotional moments, but the true meat and bones of the story are between the two leads and the lives they lead.The design of this film is impeccable, capturing the architecture and styling so well of the early 1900s. Lady and the Tramp was the first animated movie created in CinemaScope, and it visually shows with breathtaking background paintings and wonderfully full shot compositions. Likewise, the animation of the animals is just smooth and authentic. The dogs are given such great personalities, borrowing from both dog and human characteristics.it's great to see Tramp's switching from playboy to protector, and Lady gives a full range of emotion throughout the film. And of course, the most memorable romantic moment in Disney animation happens here when Lady and Tramp share a lovely Bella Notte.Although not a musical in the usual sense that Disney is known for, there is a small selection of songs that pop-up throughout the film. Written and performed mostly by singer Peggy Lee, these songs are quite charming and as catchy as a lullaby that swims in your head. Lee's voice- acting prowess even earned her a character named after her in the film, Peg, who performs He's A Tramp, which could easily have been a hit without the help of the movie. The Siamese Cat Song, despite its brief display of the stereotyping that occurred during the time, is also a fun character driven moment that introduces us to what could be considered the film's villains, if the villain isn't just life itself.Lady and the Tramp is, in fact, the rare Disney gem that doesn't have a pure, clear-cut villain that continuously steals the show and motivates the plot. Instead, it relies on general dangers of dog life and the type of obstacles it throws at you to create the tension. And that's all it needs. It does for domesticated animals what Bambi did for wild animals before it. It romanticizes them, and shows just how loving dogs can be."
29,Lady and the Tramp,10,15 July 2015,Masterpiece Disney Film,"I grew up with this wonderful film. This is one of my most favorite movies not from Disney or that it's animated but one of my favorite films in general.This film just only gets better with age no matter how many times you watch this film it just gets better. It just still holds upDisney really hit a home run with Lady and the Tramp and many who watch this film grew up with Dogs and love this film it not that you have to be a dog lover to enjoy this film you can enjoy it for just being a wonderful well written, perfectly hand drawn and great story telling. It just a wonderful film all together Lady And The Tramp is just one of those rare amazing Disney films that holds up ever more so What makes Lady and the Tramp special is that the animators kept the focus on the dogs through out the whole film the film was seen from the dog's point of view and the camera stays on the ground level with the dogs now that's amazing for this motion picture My top three favorite scenes in Lady and the Tramp are the ""We are Siamese"" song from the cats, the Spaghetti and meatballs scene where Lady and the Tramp created one of the most iconic moments in both Disney and Motion Picture history and the battle between Tramp and The Rat is one scene that has stuck with me since I was a kid because how well animated that fight was and to this day remains a impressive climax. It just goes to show how well the animation is still holds up as the fight is surrounded in darkness and lighting effect with thunder clashWith a great performance from the voice work it just still impressive with the voice talents they pick for this film, The music is beautiful along with the songs that were written for this film the music department did a wonderful job and the music help told the story for Lady and The Tramp. The Animation is just beautiful all attention went into making this a wonderful well hand drawn animation with the background being amazing and the character movements show case how superb hand drawn animation is still impressiveTrust me you must watch Lady and The Tramp the film remains great and still remains one of the best films from childhoodI give Lady and the Tramp a perfect 10 out of 10"
30,Lady and the Tramp,8,10 November 2014,Charming Disney Classic,"Disney was on a role during the early 1950's with successful films being released as both Cinderella and Peter Pan did a fantastic job at the box office. In fact, Cinderella was so profitable for the Walt Disney company that it saved them from going bankrupt and they were able to release a string of fantastic classics. Lady and the Tramp would continue that trend with its release in 1955. Disney once again managed to produce a classic that was a huge success at the box office. Lady and the Tramp still remains a classic to this day.The story that was used for Lady and the Tramp was influenced by the idea of Joe Grant, who was one of the writers for Disney. In 1937, he offered the idea to Walt about making a film about dogs. He was inspired by his English Springer Spaniel named Lady. Disney allowed Grant to start working on the story development, but Walt wasn't pleased with the story because of Lady's character and the lack of action. In the early 1940's, Walt read a short tale by Ward Greene, called Happy Dan, The Whistling Dog. After reading the story, Disney wanted Lady to fall in love with a cynical dog, who was eventually named Tramp. The production of the film was put on hold due to World War II, but was picked back up after the war was over. Even though Grant left the company in 1949, the Walt Disney company went on with the development of Lady and the Tramp and the film was released in 1955.The plot for Lady and the Tramp is very basic. Lady (voiced by Barbara Luddy) feels abandoned by her owners, Jim Dear (voiced by Lee Millar) and Darling (voiced by Peggy Lee), after their first baby is born. Lady encounters the Tramp, who lives on the street. At first, she wants nothing to do with him because she and her two dog friends, Jock and Trusty, don't trust the rough Tramp. Eventually, Lady and the Tramp fall in love with each other. When Lady's owners leave the house for a couple of days, Aunt Sarah (Voiced by Verna Falton) takes care of the house and the baby. She doesn't like Lady and lets her stay outside. Lady sees a rat climbing into the baby's room and warns the Tramp. He chases the rat and catches him, but Aunt Sarah already called the dog catchers, who take the Tramp with them. Lady, Jock and Trusty manage to save the tramp and all ends well.Lady and the Tramp is a beautiful Disney classic. What it lacks in story lines and character depth, it makes up for with fantastic animation and charm. Bella Notte is a fine song and the romantic scene where Lady and the Tramp are eating spaghetti is unforgettable. Lady and the Tramp are both likable characters, although they aren't anything special. The other songs in the film are enjoyable enough. Overall, Lady and the Tramp might seem like nothing more than a basic love story, but the things that are good are done so incredibly well that it makes for a timeless classic."
31,Lady and the Tramp,9,20 October 2014,Dog Day Afternoon,"I only had the pleasure of watching many of the famous Disney classics for the first time last December and while I enjoyed almost all of them, Lady and the Tramp was one I absolutely fell in love with. One of the aspects which makes Lady and the Tramp great is its ability to pull off a love story not only free of clichés but also manages to feel fresh. Going into this movie I was concerned that it would the typical high class girl falls in love with low class guy (well dogs in this case) but I was very pleasantly surprised. Both Lady and Tramp are believable characters but display subtle dog traits which I didn't even notice the first time I watched the film. Perhaps the most humorous of these would be the fact the dogs in the film refer to Lady's owners and ""Jim Dear"" and ""Darling"" as this is what the two call each other throughout the film. The little details like this warrant Lady and the Tramp as a film worthy of multiple viewings.Lady and the Tramp was the first animated produced in CinemaScope and they sure took advantage of the new format. The whole movie is one big ignition of the senses; could a movie be more relaxing to watch than this? Just like Lady I don't want this seemingly perfect world of early 1900's Americana to be altered in any way; notice throughout the entire the film everyday is filled bright sunshine and it only starts to rain when things hit their worst. The date sequence also surprised me greatly; having seen it parodied to death my entire life I didn't think it would have anything to offer me; yet their entire date had me awe and left my breathless. The soundtrack also offers some of the most memorable compositions and songs in Disney history, perfectly capturing the essence of falling in love. Lady And The Tramp is an absolute heart melting charmer If I ever saw one and my personal favourite animated Disney film from Walt's era."
32,Lady and the Tramp,8,2 August 2013,"""Lady and the Tramp"" is a fun Disney picture, but to call it a romance would be a bit much","Walt Disney's ""Lady and the Tramp"" was the first full-length animated feature shot in widescreen. But aside from its significance in animated film history, does ""Lady and the Tramp"" still hold up well as a movie? In general, that seems to be the case even though some moments are better than others. ""Lady and the Tramp"" begins with a happy couple receiving a cocker spaniel puppy for Christmas whom they eventually call Lady. A rather weird name to give a dog, but I digress. Lady is living an enjoyable life with her human owners and her two dog friends in the neighborhood, a Scottish terrier named Jock and a bloodhound named Trusty. On the opposite part of town, a mutt referred to by many as the Tramp (for whatever reason) enjoys living life to the fullest without either an owner or a collar. When these two direct opposites first run into each other, they don't seem to think much of each other (at least Jock and Trusty don't think much of him). But due to various circumstances that Lady undergoes, these two dogs run into each other once more and as they get to know each other with their adventures together, they fall in love.I'll be perfectly frank. I think it's a bit much to have ""Lady and the Tramp"" be a love story. In my opinion, I didn't see a credible love story here. I saw a credible story about friendship and getting to know one another instead which would have been far more appropriate in my mind. Just based on the events that occurred within this story, I think that Lady and the Tramp falling in love with each other after all this said and done was a stretch for me. I didn't believe that these two dogs had a plausible romance between each other based on what we were given. The subplot involving Lady's dilemma with her owners expecting a baby doesn't help either. I felt like that subplot which takes up about 20% of this 75-minute picture just wasn't that interesting. I felt like that went on longer than it should have and felt a little tacky overall as proved with the mediocre song ""What is a Baby/La La Lu"". Speaking of the songs, the other songs including ""Bella Notte"", an excellent romantic song, and ""He's a Tramp"", a nice and jazzy tune, aren't that bad. I thought that the animation design on some of the dogs, particularly Lady and Peg, was successful at giving these dogs human like qualities. Whether it's with expressing their emotions or having some physical similarities to humans, whoever came up with these designs knew what they were doing. Speaking of the characters, they're pretty good, too. Even though the jokes from Jock and Trusty are only so-so, they still have plenty of life to them. I still liked the two main characters even though I couldn't buy that they were in love. They have enough personality to them to work as characters. My favorite characters in this movie oddly enough are the humans, isn't that weird? I liked Lady's owners and how they literally call each other Jim Dear and Darling when talking to each other. You can tell that these two are having a happy marriage based on almost every scene they're in. Tony and Joe, the main chefs from the Italian restaurant where Lady and the Tramp eat spaghetti together (and the film's most famous scene occurs) are awesome, too. Though these guys are only present in one or two scenes, they have enough charisma and charm that they look kind of cool even when they're singing the song ""Bella Notte"" to two dogs. If anyone made a scene like that today in live-action where a few people are singing to dogs eating spaghetti, you can bet it would look pretty terrible. But here, it somehow works very well because of the animation and the overall way that scene was handled. In spite of the pet peeves I've stated earlier, ""Lady and the Tramp"" is a nice little Disney flick for kids and adults to take a look at for good evening entertainment. Will everyone truly get all of the humor present? I know I didn't get a few of the jokes. Is the story going to work for everyone as it is? Not exactly, but most will get into it anyways. Does it still have plenty of charm in its characters, animation, and music? You bet. I'd say it's worth a couple viewings."
33,Lady and the Tramp,10,23 November 2011,Amazing,"This is one of my favorite Disney movies from the '50s. Upper class dog and a streetwise dog falls in love and experiences many adventures.The sweetness and charm of this movie is Amazing. Not to mention the artwork. The story is also superb. Somehow, these older animated movies looks more artistic than the more detailed modern animation. It's like watching rich oil paintings in motion. The characters that appears in this movie is sweeter than the dark and computerized characters we see today.No matter what I write here won't do any justice to the awesomeness of this movie.Innocence that we don't see any more in animation is captured in this movie."
34,Lady and the Tramp,9,8 July 2011,I'm 18 and I still really enjoy it,"Talk about a truly timeless film, even though didn't grow up in the 50s, this movie is still just as good as I'm sure it was back in 1955. The animation is absolutely beautiful, and the songs are really well done as well, they aren't Disco, or songs that will go out of style any time soon.Lady, a cocker Spaniel from the leash and collar part of town is afraid when her owners have a baby. Realizing that there love for her won't change, she helps by protecting the baby when they leave. Unfortunaly, the real baby sitter aunt Sarah brought two evil, and I mean evil cats along that get her in trouble and she runs off. She meets up with a dog named the Tramp, who after helping get a muzzle off, takes Lady out for a night on the town.I refuse to believe that the Rat was the main villain of this movie, no, it's Aunt Sarah, her and her stupid cats. I love to hate them just as much as I love the two leads. I'm 18, and I'm not afraid to admit that I really like this movie, the Diamond edition comes out in Spring 2012, and I will most likely be buying it."
35,Lady and the Tramp,10,5 January 2011,A Great Romantic story,"I've seen this movie as a child and liked it! Now as a grown up I Like it even more! Lady and the Tramp is one Great Classic By Disney with one of the best Romantic stories. The Movie opened with the song ""Bella Notte"" which for me is one of the best song opening besides ""Circle of life"" in The Lion King. Another catchy song was the Siamese cat's song, very unique and brings back memories of my childhood.Besides the songs, Characters in this movie blends magically & the chemistry between the Lady and the Tramp is undeniable. This Cartoon never gets Old, and suitable for all ages! For anyone who is fan of Disney's Classics, this is one that should be seen!"
36,Lady and the Tramp,10,10 March 2009,"The most memorable of the 50s Disneys, before Sleeping Beauty!","This is a beautiful film, and one of Disney's finest. It isn't as heart-rending as Bambi, or as entertaining as the Jungle Book, but Lady and the Tramp is solid in both those departments. The animation is lovely, and so are the songs. The Bella Notte scene, is not only the highlight of the film, but it was one of the most romantic scenes in animation history. The only scene that surpasses this, is the Ballroom sequence in Beauty and the Beast, which is one of the finest pieces of artistry I have ever seen on film. The voice talents are a delight too, most notably Peggy Lee, who was the voice of Peggy, Darling, and those diabolical(in a good way) Siemese cats. Barbara Luddy was wonderful also as Lady, a highly convincing animal protagonist. Also worth noting are vocals by Bill Thompson and Verna Felton. And I mustn't forget the really sinister rat, who never speaks, but you really feel angry when it wants to kill the baby, so I felt a great deal of pleasure when Tramp kills it. The glowing eyes did it for me. All in all, a stunning film that is a must-see! 10/10 Bethany Cox"
37,Lady and the Tramp,6,10 September 2007,Dog love story,"Lady and the Tramp is a classic Disney. Classic in the sense that it can be taken as an example of a specific era in Disney history - in fact it represents a time in the development of animation. 1955 is the happy time of Disney - Walt was still alive - and everything in Lady and the Tramp reflects this time. The watercolour backgrounds, the animation, anthropomorphism of characters and the accents used, as well as some clichés and half prejudices. Only half, as Disney was well aware of sensitivities... and that his audience was the American melting pot.I like Lady and the Tramp because it is also giving a message that value is inside, it has poetic overtones, some scenes (like the spaghetti dish scenes) are just so funny.This charming story of an ""uptown"" dog being wooed by a poor but brave dog is really well made. This is the sort of movie made for kids for eternity."
38,Lady and the Tramp,8,12 July 2007,Many MORE thank you's Walt!,"Genre: Animated Disney with dogs and set in 1800's America.My thoughts: Yet another Disney I grew up with, ""Lady And The Tramp"" is yet again another one of my favourites. I think it is one of Walt's best triumphs. I like how originally, this movie wasn't going to be based on a book (unlike all the other Disneys, some make a total chaotic MESS of the book). It WAS based on a book, but I don't think it was ever published (because I can't find it on Amazon, Albris or any of the book websites and it said it was never published on a different website). I THINK the book is called ""Happy Dan, The Whistling Dog.""ANYWAY I love this film. Tramp is just such a good character, half good and half bad. Lady is cute as well and a very faithful dog. I like Jock and Trusty, I like how they gave the Scottish terrier Jock a Scottish accent rather than an American one. I love the animation, most of the time Disney animation was always beautiful (until they started up with CGI films, WAY less beautiful than Pixar). I love this film!Recommended to: People who love Disneys, dogs and cartoon. Enjoy! What happens: From the moment she finds herself out of a Christmas present box, Lady, the Cocker spaniel puppy, enjoys life and growing up. She also likes routines. Unfortunately, something happens which makes her owners ignore her more and more"
39,Lady and the Tramp,8,22 April 2006,Slight Canine Romance Embellished by Classic Disney Artistry in Full Bloom,"It's great to see such a sparkling product of the luxuriant hand-drawn animation that the Disney studios offered in the 1950's. Such artistry has been bypassed by the impersonal cleanliness provided by state-of-the-art CGI technology, but the trademark Disney warmth seems to emanate most from the combination of stop-motion techniques and a rich color palette as displayed here. As far as plots and characters go, 1955's ""Lady and the Tramp"" is not the best of the Disney canon since the ""Bambi"" and ""Dumbo"" have more heart and ""101 Dalmatians"" more savvy and humor. However, on its own, the 76-minute movie contains a great deal of charm that is hard to resist even if you are not a pre-schooler.Set in the Midwest in the turn of the last century, the story unwraps slowly and focuses squarely on Lady, a young couple's pampered cocker spaniel who later feels usurped by a new baby. Things get worse when the couple asks dog-hating Aunt Sarah, with her Siamese cats in tow, to baby sit during an extended trip. Feeling unwanted, Lady ventures out and meets a scruffy, bon vivant mongrel who shows her the world - including a stop in the back alley of his favorite Italian restaurant where to the strains of ""Bella Notte"", they famously kiss over a dangling spaghetti noodle. Elements of suspense and drama are introduced with an aggressive dog catcher and a motley, rather international lot of strays at a dilapidated pound.The movie is so lovingly executed by Disney stalwarts Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske that it would be almost sacrilegious to knock. But truth be told, the pacing is a tad too leisurely, and the potential opportunities for Cruella De Vil-level villainy presented by Aunt Sarah, her cats and the dog catcher are not realized. What is left is a sweet, soft-centered love story with a comic gallery of supporting dogs and a smattering of songs by Peggy Lee and Sonny Burke, the two most memorable being Peg's saucy 4-1-1 to Lady, ""He's a Tramp"", and ""The Siamese Cat Song"" performed with a seething, politically incorrect WWII propaganda-style hiss. It's far more entertaining than offensive.The 2006 two-disc DVD package celebrating the 50th anniversary of the movie's original release date is chock full of extras, many of them aimed squarely at children including a trivia game, a dog personality quiz and a brief primer on dog breeds narrated by comic actor Fred Willard. The most interesting extra is a seven-chapter, 52-minute documentary, ""Lady's Pedigree: The Making of Lady and the Tramp"", which goes in-depth into the movie's creation. There are two other featurettes of note, one covering the storyboard creation process behind Lady and the other more intriguing, a 1943 storyboard version of the movie completely different from the final product. This film is still essential viewing for classic Disney animation aficionados."
40,Lady and the Tramp,8,7 March 2006,This is the night....,"What a lovely film.Even as I write this the film will be 56 years old this coming June.What a lovely film to look at. The color is great.Wonderful music. ""Bella Notte"" ""This Is The Night..........""A local chain of Italian restaurants we have where I live the location we normally visit has a ""Lady & the Tramp"" table. We always ask to sit there if it is empty when we arrive.Totally enjoyed the new 50th anniversary DVD. The ""Making Of"" sections were great to watch with a lot of interesting information.Keeping in mind you can say the film is dated. Only because of the time it was set in. That is it.1955 was a good year for Walt Disney with the release of this film and Disneyland's opening.I always watch this film at Christmas time. Just because the film begins & ends at Christmas time.A true classic."
41,Lady and the Tramp,10,11 June 2001,A funny animated tale of love! Bravo for Walt Disney!,"WOW! Is this a great movie! This is one of the best Walt Disney movies ever made! I have this movie, and all I have to say is wow. This movie is a classic, and it's unforgettable. This is one of the greatest pictures by Walt Disney! I give this movie a 10 out of 10!!!!"
42,Lady and the Tramp,,25 February 2001,"Great flick, loved it as a kid and still do, the c...","Great flick, loved it as a kid and still do, the characters, voices, songs, animation and etx are all classics. It's definitely well worth your time if you give it a shot. The finale is good too. I was gratified to hear Thurl Ravenscroft, Mel Blanc and Alan Reed(Fred Flintstone) doing voices here, the things you appreciate as an adult eh?A classic.**** outta ****"
43,Lady and the Tramp,9,23 September 2000,My personal favorite Disney,"Lady and the tramp. a true disney classic that doesn't get the attention the other greats do but is in my opinion one of the best. A high class dog who runs away from home after her owners have a baby who meets up with a wild and crazy cool tramp. The usual great animation and songs including ""Siamese Cat Song"" and the love song to eat spaghetti by ""Bella Notte"" on a scale of one to ten...9"
44,Lady and the Tramp,,2 January 1999,"A classic forever, a true love story","If you haven't seen this movie yet, go see it as soon as possible. The animation is greatly done and the music is beautiful. You will also find that the story is well written and will keep you watching the film over and over again. Although you will find a small amount of action near the end of the film this is definitely a story about the love that Lady and the Tramp share. The love story keeps you interested because it's between two dogs, not two humans. Even if you don't like these kind of movies, watch this one just for the animation."
45,Lady and the Tramp,,8 July 2017,great,"and the good thing is the less chance to say why. maybe for the inspired art of ... translation. because it is a fable and inspired remember of basic tools of romanticism. because it is one of charming stories becoming testimony about sensibility of a period and precious legacy. because it is a beautiful explanation of the source of seduction for Disney universe. and because it is more real than reality itself. the scene from bistro is the most useful argument.so, out of all, a great, great film. this is all."
46,Lady and the Tramp,9,8 March 2017,Just DOGgone Fun,"In recent years, Disney flicks like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Cars (to name a few) have set the gold standard for kiddie fare: silly fun, drama/humor combo, and enough of a ""hook"" to keep the parents from ""zzzzzzzzzz's"". Films like ""Lady and the Tramp"" were the building blocks of that legacy.For a basic plot summary, this film sees a female dog ""Lady"" getting separated from her owners and ending up with a male dog ""Tramp"" for a series of adventures both humorous and dramatic.At its core, ""Lady and the Tramp"" is a simple ""opposites attract"" love story: Lady is confused by changes in her luxurious home and wonders what a more carefree life would be like. Tramp is a carefree spirit at heart but also yearns for someone to share his adventures with. Throw in some humor, great music, a touch of drama, and a simple, heartfelt plot, and this film really stands out among some of its contemporary Disney fare.In short, show this movie to a child in your life and watch them light up. Along the way, recollect the nostalgia of your own first (or multiple) viewings. A great time to be had by all."
47,Lady and the Tramp,10,4 February 2017,As ol' Reliable used to say...,"Lady (voice of Barbara Luddy) is an affectionate purebred Cocker Spaniel taken in by a fairly upper class couple, ""Jim Dear"" and ""Darling"". When the couple go on vacation, and their babysitter, Aunt Sarah (voice of Verna Felton) brings two trouble making Siamese casts (voice of singer Peggy Lee) with her, circumstances result in Lady on the streets and far from home. She's rescued by a previous acquaintance, a rascally but charming mongrel named Tramp (voice of Larry Roberts), and he tries to show her that life without a home is supposedly better.Based on a story by Ward Greene, the Disney Studios' ""Lady and the Tramp"" is far and away one of their most charming. It works especially well for any dog lover (such as this viewer), and in fact there's a dedication at the beginning to mans' best friend. The characters are vivid and engaging, and enthusiastically performed by the well chosen voice cast. There are a few good musical numbers (the dog group singing is done by ""The Mellomen""), and the animation is as rich and detailed as you could possibly get. Even 62 years later, it's an impressive display of classic hand drawn animation. The story isn't afraid to get somewhat dark, or potentially bittersweet, but it does succeed at winning ones' heart, with an especially endearing finale. The spaghetti dinner scene is simply unforgettable.Roberts is a fun Tramp, and Luddy is good as the rather pampered but NOT snooty Lady. Si and Am walk away with their one big scene, and two other scene stealers are Lady's loyal neighborhood friends Jock (voiced by Bill Thompson), a Scottish terrier, and Trusty (voiced by Bill Baucom), a retired bloodhound who has lost his sense of smell. Alan Reed, best known as the voice of Fred Flintstone, can also be heard here, as Boris.Very fine family entertainment (the first animated feature by Disney to be shot in CinemaScope), followed decades later by a direct-to-DVD sequel.10 out of 10."
48,Lady and the Tramp,7,23 September 2014,"Worth a watch, especially if your a dog person","The main thing that stands out about this movie is the animation and the expressions of the dogs. It's actually quite realistic when it comes to dogs behavior patterns as well. The movie basically deals about dogs lives, one that lives in a home with a loving human family and a dog that lives in the streets. And what they deal with and the romance that build between both the dogs. If you are a dog person, you just might really like this one. Because when it comes to the dog elements, it's actually quite spot on. Even the characters, especially because of the voice actors and actresses really brings this movie to life.7.3/10"
49,Lady and the Tramp,7,8 December 2013,A Dog's Tale,"Walt Disney's animated tale of a budding, star-crossed romance between two dogs: one, a pampered golden cocker spaniel named Lady, loved by her family but recently neglected by the arrival of a new baby, and a street-wise but kind-hearted mutt named Tramp who manages to survive on the streets with the kindness(and food!) from strangers. One day, they happen to meet, and there is an attraction, but between dog catchers pursuing Tramp to put him in the pound, and two Siamese cats up to no good in Lady's home, prove a challenge to their freedom. Definitely for Dog lovers, though all animal lovers should still enjoy this charming tale with nice animation and colorful supporting character animals."
50,Lady and the Tramp,,25 December 2012,A canine romance,"Lady is a cocker spaniel puppy and it is clear that her owners love her very much; indeed they say that nothing could replace her in their affections that is until they learn a baby is on the way. Then Lady starts to feel second best. Things get even worse when her owners go away leaving the aunt to look after Lady and the baby for a few days. After a run-in with Aunt's two devious Siamese cats Lady is blamed for the trouble and finds herself forced to wear a muzzle. She manages to escape and meets up with Tramp; an ownerless dog that lives a free life one step ahead of the dog catcher. He tries to persuade Lady that his is the good life but she wants to go home. On the way back they cross paths with the dog catcher and she is caught; her licence ensures she isn't in the pound for long though. When she gets back home Lady sees a rat entering the baby's room and Tramp rushes into help; this could be the end of him though as Auntie things he is attacking the baby and calls the pound; if he is to survive Lady's friends will have to help him out.This Disney classic might not be up there with the likes of 'Snow White' or 'Dumbo' but it is a delightful film with a story that can be enjoyed by all ages. As one would expect the hand drawn animation looks great and the backgrounds are stunningly detailed. The cast of voice actors do a fine job voicing human and canine characters. There are less songs than many Disney films but that isn't a bad thing and the few that there are, are fun; I particularly liked the well known song sung by the slightly sinister Siamese cats. As one would expect there is nothing to offend and the scares are good enough to make the story exciting without disturbing younger viewers. If you are a fan of classic animation you should watch this given the chance."
51,Lady and the Tramp,7,9 April 2011,Disney magic,"Lady and the Tramp sums up what Disney can do so well. When they are good they are very good and that is why this film lives on as a classic.With classic characters, great musical numbers and a strong sense of story this film appeals to both adults and kids equally. There is a warmth and high quality nature to this film that I feel many of these new animated films lack.The combination of pencil drawn animation and fantastic vocal work more than beats the now routine 3D work that film studios force down our necks.This film is one of Disney's best and although the belated sequel is passable it is not a patch on this beloved Disney tale."
52,Lady and the Tramp,,21 July 2009,sweet dust,"A film with the story of relation with a general audience that this has, steps outside the ordinary rules that i respect when commenting on films. When i write, i never intend to make such a thing as a ""critic"". Instead i try to isolate and write down a few notes on things that made the film to my eyes, to my mind, to my emotions. Writing helps me understand and understanding improves my viewing. Therefore i become (i hope) a better film viewer. I root my opinions on the films themselves, i only comment on what i see.Why do i mention this? Because right now i'm commenting on a film which by now is more of a collective memory than a film on its own. Rewatching this made me realize that we no longer remember and talk about Lady and the Tramp, we talk about what our memory makes of it. As far as animated films go, i belong to one of the last generations for whom a certain number of films (most of them Disney's) hung over our heads as the stereotype for moral values and its cinematic representation. What does this mean? It means that if you wouldn't want to go further in your research, films like this were The thing. A kind of dogma, untouchable and true from any point of view. I'm OK with that because we have the freedom to step outside and inside the world of these films. Reading the average IMDb comment on this films frames this comment.I sure need to come back to films like this once in a while, it's a child memory. But most of what i remembered is not here. The film is incredibly flat, especially since now we have Pixar induced digital depth. The characters are rendered sweetly, and really there was a kind of humanity in how these characters were created, so we related to them willingly. But the film in itself is way much smaller than what my memory makes it. The very spaghetti scene, i suppose the spoofs and celebrations of it enlarged it to a point the scene never had. It's great how the collective perception of things counterfeits our memory of them.This was a sweet comeback to a world which does not exist. Good to live there for a while, though.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
53,Lady and the Tramp,9,5 January 2018,The definitive Disney film for dog lovers,"My aunt requested that we view this film today. After the dissatisfaction I had with One Hundred and One Dalmatians not too long ago, I was concerned that Disney wouldn't actually have an abundance of stand-out titles during its supposed Golden Age. So why is this my favorite of that era?The animation doesn't just capture a small town in New England pristinely from a dog's perspective: it incorporates textures such as mud that look surprisingly more real than even some modern CGI depictions of mud. That, coupled with the spot on character designs and environments, makes this what I consider landmark for Disney in the 1950s. I was genuinely pleased at how Lady isn't actually pompous despite having been realistically spoiled for most of her youth, as well as going through what I imagine a lot of strays (like my own dog Albert once was) endure prior to their arrival at the infamous pounds. I wasn't too drawn in by Tramp's more rebellious nature, but it soon dawned that considering what lied across this movie, he indeed knew what was best, and that is a sign of noble story writing. I also felt a bit of sympathy for Aunt Sarah for not knowing Si and Am's malicious nature and for not initially understanding the circumstances as to why Jim Jr.'s crib collapsed. I really liked Bella Notte, and I felt a bit emotional during the pound singing; it reminded me of why the pound just isn't a place for dogs to be. The story has masterful humor and more effective appeal to dog lovers (at least, I find) than the films before it and most certainly after. It's real refreshing considering modern Disney believes that the main appeal to dog lovers comes from making MORE. BUDDIES. MOVIES. But alas, I found the story top tier overall.If you like animation, Disney, dogs, or 50s films, you will find something pleasing about viewing this film. For anyone else, please do go see it. I cannot imagine another Disney movie so far being as appealing to those who like dogs as this, so do view it at some point."
54,Lady and the Tramp,10,4 March 2017,A Disney Classic,"Lady, a golden cocker spaniel, meets up with a mongrel dog who calls himself the Tramp. He is obviously from the wrong side of town, but happenings at Lady's home make her decide to travel with him for a while. This turns out to be a bad move, as no dog is above the law. Lady and the Tramp explores the friendship and later love story between 2 dogs named Lady and Tramp and if there's a really famous scene is definitely their first kiss plus the side characters were also pretty fun as well. This is a Disney Classic at it's finest with hundreds of Special Editions threw the years that make the movie even better and better with each viewing."
55,Lady and the Tramp,9,3 December 2016,"Look, a Little Cockerel a Spanish","As a child I was moved by this film. This is a sort of Romeo and Juliet version of the dog world. Lady is a cute little cocker spaniel who lives with her master's. They have a new baby. The baby is being stalked by a couple evil Siamese cats. When the cats do something that endangers the baby, it appears the mayhem is blamed on Lady. Tramp is a free spirit and falls for the little gal. He feels for her and they run off. Unfortunately, they are pursued by the dog catcher and wind up in the pound. Before that, however, they have a series of adventures where Lady experiences a frightening but exciting life that she never had before. There are fantastic songs and beautifully drawn characters. Peggy Lee plays a Pekingese with an attitude and a great voice. Fine animated Disney film."
56,Lady and the Tramp,10,29 September 2016,True Classic Disney !,One of Disney's finest animated films.Great storytelling combined with catchy songs and flawless animation makes Disney's first CinemaScope feature a masterpiece! Recommended for both children and adults alike but especially dog lovers! The classic spaghetti eating scene along with the Siamese cat scene are two highlights and my personal favorites! An absolute must for any Disney collection or ANY film collection for that matter!!! Ten out of ten stars for sure! Oh and special mention to voice actors Peggy Lee and Disney veterans Barbara Luddy and Verna Fulton who give a fabulous performance as well as the entire voice-over cast!!
57,Lady and the Tramp,7,8 July 2015,Sweet little movie,"Sweet little movie.The story of a domestic dog, Lady, who befriends a stray, Tramp. Cue adventures, and not a little romance...Kids will love it. Plot is fairly simple and who doesn't like talking dogs? Entertaining enough for adults too. However, lacks the substance to be a great movie. Doesn't overstay its welcome though and not a bad way to spend 75 or so minutes of your time.Decent animation and good voice casting. Peggy Lee, the singer, provides four of the voices and provides the musical highlight of the movie, The Siamese Cat Song."
58,Lady and the Tramp,7,9 July 2011,in dogs we trust,"It is a very touching Disney story and it should be watched by kids, adults, dog owners, anyone. And i say touching not only because of the romantic story between Lady and the Tramp, but because of the successful effort of the creators to reveal in a cartoon the instincts of dogs. The sound editing including the dogs' barking and howling are for me the most important characteristics of the film. It is one of few in the industry where the characters are almost exclusively driven to behave by their instincts. One interesting scene, because of its sincerity, is -beside the Bella note sequence- when Jock and Trusty go to ask Lady for a (reproduction) relationship after she returns home- it's about dogs anyway. The other scene that moved me was the chase of the car, when Trusty proves that hasn't lost his sense of smell and when Jock cries for his friend- a very strong scene.And as about the issue of social classes that are reflected in the film, i would say that since aunt Sarah comes along,the rich outskirts and their symbols (pedigree cats, luxurious houses and cars, pet shops) are undoubtedly connected with Lady's frightening experiences. On the other hand it is near the Tramp and the dark streets when she only finds shelter and freedom. And if the happy ending includes a life at the rich neighborhood, we shouldn't forget that it's the 50's and it's a film for kids where ideals about family and average lifestyles are usually to be shown."
59,Lady and the Tramp,10,22 July 2005,Classic Disney film!,"I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities. The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear. Not to mention beautiful! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious Looney Tunes characters that we all love. in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen. In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do! If you like the original Looney Tunes and animated films then I strongly recommend that you watch this movie today!"
60,Lady and the Tramp,,1 April 2002,Product of the fifties status quo,"Lady and the Tramp is more than a cheesy love story. It is a lesson to the young and naïve about the dangers of not putting a woman in her proper place, as defined by race, gender and social class. The film is a product of the fifties, a time of seeming stability before the outbreak of various protest movements. The calm and stability of the status quo was highly valued. Jock disgustedly spits at the Tramp that he will have `no mongrel and his radical ideas.' Disney establishes early on that there will be no experimenting with the status quo. The dogs are an allegory for human love and marriage practice, ultimately supporting the cult of domesticity, race and class-consciousness.Jim dear tells Lady on her first night in the home, ""C'mere. This is where you belong. Right here [in the dog bed]."" Lady refuses to stay where she belongs, growing too close to the humans and overstepping her boundaries as a dog. She is read as a human character, and fed coffee and donuts from the table. Before the baby is born, Darling declares, ""I don't imagine anything could take her place in our hearts,"" but the baby later does displace Lady and she needs to discover her acceptable place in society. The baby is a catalyst for an inevitable journey, now that Lady has reached adulthood. In the fifties women did not have many options for their future, and this is evident as Lady travels from place to place learning where she does not belong.Lady and the Tramp do not belong in the zoo because a sign clearly states ""No Dogs Allowed."" At the zoo, the whole animal hierarchy is depicted, and their barred cages naturalize the separation of each animal family. The zoo establishes a prototype of the world the way it is supposed to be, and also serves as an indication of the way in which Lady challenges the status quo. When she goes to the zoo it is to free herself from society's restrictions. The muzzle is a cage limiting her, and she tries to free herself. In this instance, she does not belong at the zoo because of her gender. Far from the reality of her liberation, Lady is supposed to settle down with a family like the animals at the zoo.Neither does Lady belong in exciting places of adventure. In the big sex scene, Lady and the Tramp are pictured among nature's other natural couplings- two owls, two frogs, two humans. However, it is not enough to be with one of her own kind. She must also live with her own social class in a gender appropriate way. When she looks down from the cliff's view she sees nice homes, yards and fences. She does not even perceive the world full of adventure and excitement. Though it sounds wonderful, she is concerned about who will care for the baby. Her responsibility consists of domestic concerns befitting a woman.Class-consciousness is most clearly depicted at the pound. According to the keeper, Lady is ""too nice a girl to be in a place like [that]."" She is a respectable member of ""snob hill"" where the dogs have more class. Though Peg is a sympathetic character, Lady mixes better with her own who are not jealous of her collar. There are insurmountable obstacles to overcome in a friendship forged with the destitute dogs of the pound.With the entrance of Aunt Sarah, Lady learns that not all humans are as nice to dogs as her owners are, and that she is not accepted as a maternal figure for the human baby. Lady needs to exert her maternal instincts on her own pups. The first wrong was Jim dear and Darling's treating her as their baby, the second her treating their baby as her own. These are two situations in which her dog status is in question, and this threat is a challenge to the status quo. Lady must learn her place in society.Being a love story, where she belongs is inextricably linked to the Tramp. He shows his inner gentility by taking a shower, helping his friends escape the pound truck, attacking the dogs pursuing Lady, stopping at the window to `coochi coo' little pups, and trying to save the baby from the rat. He is a kind-hearted dog who is obviously meant for better things. He is worthy of Lady, as a father figure that literally takes her by the leash (in the muzzle scene) and leads her into a new life. He teaches her a new conception of what it is to be a dog and opens her horizons to love. She marries the Tramp once he attains a collar and license, staying within her own class of the `leash and collar set.' Lady is finally content when she has her own family and eats dog biscuits that Aunt Sarah sent. In the final scene, Lady puts her pups in their bed and keeps them there when they try to leave, the way Jim dear should have when she arrived a year earlier, and the camera pans back on the snowy scene, depicted everything right and peaceful with the world.Lady does not ever need to travel further than her own backyard, as defined by her race, gender and social-class. The adventure only led to the ruin of her reputation. Although she settled down with Tramp, if she had known her place to begin with, she never would have traveled beyond her domestic setting. The world is a dangerous place; she practically got ran over by cars and eaten by a pack of dogs and later taken to the pound. She is not able to function in the world, and as this film would have you believe, no true lady is."
61,Lady and the Tramp,10,28 September 2000,Awesome classic,"Another one of my favorite animated movies, beat out only by The Fox and the Hound and Bambi in my book. Other than them, absolutely nothing tops this. Not even Beauty and the Beast! You heard right. This is exceptionally animated, charming, and romantic. Bella Notte is one of the most heartwarming songs ever sung in a Disney movie. Another plus. This doesn't have any of the silliness found in the modern Disney movies and even some of the classics. Lady and the Tramp is Disney's most enduring classic ever. A perfect 10!"
62,Lady and the Tramp,8,5 July 2016,A good romantic movie for children.,"This is the unlikely love story between a Cocker Spaniel from a rich house and a mongrel dog who lives on the street. Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske, the film has a script by Erdman Penner and his team, based on a short story by Ward Greene.This is one movie of the golden age of Disney Studios, a classic that has appealed to generations of children and adults. Like many novels, the film shows, in a fun and light way, as love transcends social barriers. For children this works well, but the film becomes too predictable for adults who usually accompany them. This is not a serious defect: this film is for children, but even adults will have fun with the funniest scenes and the situational comedy that runs through the screen. The romantic scenes are deeply moving, showing love in its most beautiful and pure face. The voice work is good and has many experienced artists. The drawings are good, made without artifice or computerization, the old fashioned way. The songs are also good, but the highlight is certainly to ""Bella Notte"", one of the most romantic songs used in animated films so far.Although its not one of my favorites, this film promises to delight children and give good times and good memories for adults, with some nostalgic tears."
63,Lady and the Tramp,9,13 September 2015,One of Disney's most attractive works,"This is one of Disney's good movies. It's a good movie about dogs and a good movie itself. The artwork is fine, original and different, delivering a unique feeling. The story is interesting. The characters are memorable. I mean, not all of the characters are memorable in the positive sense (like the rat, Aunt Sarah and her malicious cats) but they are memorable. My favorite characters are Lady, Tramp, Tony and Joe.By the way, my favorite sequence in the whole movie is the Italian dinner at Tony's. I mean, think about it: an Italian restaurant, a candlelit dinner, two dogs choosing the menu and having Italian spaghetti for dinner, a romantic serenade (""Bella notte"") for the dogs, an accidental kiss by them, and a walk after dinner. Could it be more romantic and memorable? I'm sure the filmmakers were in a unique moment of inspiration when they created this classic sequence. It's not just an iconic sequence of the movie but also an iconic sequence in the history of cinema. Title in Portugal: 'A Dama e o Vagabundo'."
64,Lady and the Tramp,9,20 July 2015,Among the best of pre-Renaissance Disney,"I'll admit that I'm not much for romantic movies. In my opinion, many of them are overly sentimental and annoyingly predictable. But this gem from Disney truly stands out from the crowd of Hollywood's mediocre love stories.The story seems a bit trite. Good girl meets bad boy, girl doesn't like boy at first, they fall in love, the end. Lady and the Tramp's plot isn't original, but the execution is stunning. The two leads play off each other wonderfully, as both teach the other about the other side of the fence. Honestly, Tramp actually ranks among Disney's best male leads for me. He's certainly more developed than 50s counterparts Prince Charming Philip (though that's not saying a lot). And his bad boy persona seems to have influenced Dodger (Oliver and Company) and Flynn (Tangled),even though those films came out years later. Lady isn't as outstanding as Tramp, but she's a decent enough female lead and she looks adorable with him.Because of a surprisingly diverse soundtrack (ranging from the wicked ""Siamese Cat Song"" to the touching ""Bella Notte""), joyously colorful animation, and excellent characters (including supporting cast Jock and Trusty), Lady and the Tramp is not one to be missed. It's romance done right."
65,Lady and the Tramp,,19 July 2015,Warmhearted incarnate,"I'm not even sure why I like this film so much. It's not as exciting as say even Peter Pan, which was the film that came out just before it. It's not as well animated as Sleeping Beauty, which is the next film, though it has a certain soft, painting like appeal that's in its own way very pleasing and soothing. The plot is not as interesting as in Alice in Wonderland. It's not in any way revolutionary like Cinderella. And by the way, these are all Disney films from the same post-war time period.So why do I like it so much? Perhaps because it's just so very likable. And a lot of it is due to the two eponymous main characters. Lady and the Tramp are one of the greatest Disney couples. The soft innocence and loyalty of Lady meets a great match in the scampy freedom loving spirit of Tramp. The two voice actors and the talent of the animators really sell you their bond, pretty much instantly I might add.And that relationship and that bond is the fact that allows you to keep watching. Because it's a movie where nothing much happens, there's not even really a villain. Well, there are adversaries, but not a central antagonist. But the characters and their various problems are so interesting that you're happy just to follow their lives.It's a peculiar film. It's like that evening you spent with your best friends, one like many others before it and like so many that will follow. You probably won't remember it all that well a few months later, but you wouldn't trade it for anything. And sometimes it's a good thing to watch movies like that."
66,Lady and the Tramp,9,16 February 2015,Disney gold,"(82%) A film that is as adorable, sweet, and charming as the characters featured, and best of all as I wondered at times if whether this was released in the late 1960's or perhaps the early-to-mid. And the fact is I was quite a way off mainly because this has developed into sheer timelessness. Having never once watched this as a child, probably due to being way too busy watching Robocop and Mad Max, but that doesn't really matter because this is real quality Disney product and anyone can and probably will enjoy it. I loved the attention to detail in the animation, with its elements of Grimshaw and moonlit vistas. You just don't get films that look like this any more, and I doubt the suits at Disney now would allow such darkness to creep in anywhere and frighten the kiddies meaning the scenes with the spooky rat would probably have to go, and the film wouldn't be as good. It's not overly long, or filled with musical numbers that honestly children don't really like anyway. Just a simple semi-romantic well told picture that just so happens to be better than many live action love stories featuring humans released before or since."
67,Lady and the Tramp,8,15 February 2015,Disney classic,"Lady the spaniel has an idyllic life. And then her people have a baby and she is made to look guilty of destruction by the sneaky Siamese cats belonging to the babysitting aunt. After being muzzled she runs away and falls in with Tramp, a devil-may-care mongrel of no fixed abode. And so her adventures begin.Disney's 15th animated feature was original material rather than an adaptation. There is, as usual, much to like here, especially Peggy Lee's songs. Tramp is a lovable rogue, there are some entertaining set pieces, and the film as a whole has a good deal of charm. If there is a criticism, it is that the ending is just a touch glib and obvious."
68,Lady and the Tramp,8,28 December 2014,One of my all time favourite movies from Disney's time,"What can I say about this only I loved it. The story is about two dogs one is rather lady like,the other is a mongrel who fall in love.The animation is really good,the story like I said is cute and I love animals especially dogs. For an animal movie the romance between the mongrel and the cocker spaniel is adorable you can't help but be in love with the two would be lovers. Lady is a dog who's owners Jim Darling and Mrs Darling are expecting a baby,but Lady grows slightly jealous and Mr and Mrs Darling's nanny comes by with her two cats and she hates Lady as she ties her up in her dog kennel. We later meet Tramp(who is the mongrel)and like I said they fall in love. So will they, won't they? well you have to watch it to see for yourself.If you liked The Aristocrats or 101 Dalmatians then you are in luck with this movie.8/10"
69,Lady and the Tramp,,5 January 2013,magic,"it is a classic. but. more important, it is a ball of emotions and memories. charming, wise,touching, nice, wonderful, delicate, part of Disney empire, it remains more than a cartoon. it is something magic as skin of it. something out of definition because it is a trip in middle of innocence and good example of hard ,passioned work of few masters.childhood colors, sounds and way to discover life, pure joy far from kitsch, beauty as little song, precise drawing and smart script. a film about values in form of fable or fairy tale. or secret pocket for a strange present. each meeting with Lady and Tramp, Darling and James Dear is a form to stop the time. so, it remains classic cure for dust and sickness of ordinaries days."
70,Lady and the Tramp,7,18 October 2012,"""Doggone.""","I'll be seriously dating myself here when I say that this is the first film I ever saw in a movie theater. Not in some re-release, but the real deal - my parents took me to see this during it's original release back when I was four or five years old. I can even remember where it was, the old Goshen Theater in Goshen, New York. So if you're reading this and know where I'm talking about, it would be cool to say hello.That was my prime motivation in watching this again, to see my first ever movie experience and share it with my granddaughter who's the same age now as when I first saw it. I can tell the magic works when she sits wide eyed and attentive, and gets a kick out of the same things I used to. It's weird the things you remember after a half century, like the words to the Siamese cat song; how does that work? That and things like The Tramp's pals Jock and Trusty.But nostalgia carries it only so far. Watching today I could enjoy the animation and vibrant use of color but the story itself seems a bit underdeveloped and simple. The sequence with the killer rat seemed a little too far fetched for me to accept, and the fast forward to Lady and the Tramp having their own family of pups huddled around the Christmas tree was out of synch with the rest of the story. Still it's a fun movie and ideal for the young and the young at heart. Walt Disney would have been proud to know his talent has reached across the generations to entertain one and all for so long after his passing."
71,Lady and the Tramp,10,27 September 2012,"Puppies, Spaghetti, and romance, what could be more awesome","A sophisticated lady and a street-smart dog falling in love. This concept has been used so much (example: titanic, dirty dancing, you name it), but it's adorable when it's about two dogs. The power of love really stands out compared to Disney classics such as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. And that's why doggie love is a 10/10What I like about this movie is that there is rarely a villain blocking their way, but there are obstacles instead (the dog catcher, Siamese cats, the rat and aunt Sarah). It plays out differently compared to the majority of Disney movies. The songs aren't that great, but they are cute and enjoyable to hear. Bella Notte (Beautiful Night in Italian) is a masterpiece. I wish someone could sing this to my boyfriend and I when we eat spaghetti and meatballs. The kiss between Lady and Tramp is adorable and I'm getting excited just about now.I can see why so many people love this movie. It's charming and innocent, but the romance is what makes the movie stand out from the other movies (sorry princesses and prince movies, this is the most romantic Disney movie ever) Go watch it and make sure you cook some spaghetti and meatballs!"
72,Lady and the Tramp,8,14 March 2012,Relaly lovely film!!!,"Fairy tale about the romance between two dogs from opposite sides of the tracks gets colorful, warm, old-fashioned Disney treatment. Cinemascope cartoon unfolds with valentine-like flair, all the ribbons and bows are in place, yet the requisite cutesy flourishes and manipulation inevitably turn up (one dog, thought to have been killed, shows up LIMPING in the next scene!). Yet, it's hard to complain when the rest of the pieces fall into place so snugly. The plot is, by turns, comfortably predictable and still pleasingly reassuring, though a bit heavy with incidental chatter. The Peggy Lee music is delightful, and the ""Bella Notte"" sequence alone, with the spaghetti, breadsticks and the drippy candle, is simply superb. *** from ****"
73,Lady and the Tramp,10,2 December 2010,"My favorite ""doggy"" film","This is another Disney favorite from my childhood. You know, I found it strange to love this animated ""doggy"" film, because I am a cat-lover. I also love the ""riches/rags"" love story between well-bred Lady and street-wise, stray downtown Tramp; I really love his impressions.I love the beginning of the film when Lady is a little puppy, she was so cute. I also love the scene where Jock and Trusty tried to explain human babies to Lady. And I love 3 out the songs from the film's soundtrack: ""The Siamese Cat Song,"" ""Bella Notte,"" and... ""He's a Tramp."" Overall, I love this film and it's another Disney favorite; my dad's favorite too."
74,Lady and the Tramp,9,26 August 2010,Best Disney film since Bambi at the time,"Though legally based off a short story by Ward Greene, the actual roots of The Lady and the Tramp are in a series of sketches by storyman Joe Grant that the studio had shelved years before. Unfortunately, Grant left the studio long before production began, and never received credit for the film that had been loosely based off his own concept, but animators like Eric Goldberg have worked to increase awareness of his contribution and the story itself lives on in this excellent film.As for the film itself, it turned a mighty profit and drummed up a less receptive critical response, who criticized the lack of depth to the characters (bizarre how this is the Disney film that invites such ire...). Despite such criticisms, which are probably rooted in the fact that most of the characters are admittedly variations on stereotypes, this is actually the subtlest and most character driven Disney film since Bambi. Considering the high concepts and low emotions of the last few Disney movies, such strong storytelling is probably why this film was their best work since the golden age, marking a (brief) return to the quality of those early masterworks for the next few films.The problem was that Disney's previous few films were all plot. Character goes from point A to point B, encounters obstacle, overcomes obstacles, etc. Cinderella was a bit better in that it wasn't so narrative, but it suffered from a boring protagonist. Disney's strength was in animals and broad human characters, which, ironically, were always far more emotive and closer to human mannerisms than their realistic humans. With The Lady and the Tramp, Disney makes the right decision to keep the humans off-screen (being much more expressive with their hands than with their features) and focus instead on the world of dogs (which are just symbols of humans anyway).Each character is definitely defined, with Lady's pampered, sheltered lifestyle reflected in her prettied-up appearance and dainty mannerisms contrasting sharply with that of Tramp, who revels in dirt and walks like he owns the streets. It's an obvious conflict, but effective like all the best romantic obstacles. Opposites attract indeed.One could try to read some social implication here, but I'm not sure it's that deep. Rather, the theme here is of many different types of creatures interacting, making this more of a general and simplified story about prejudice than anything else. Honestly, I'd have liked Disney to get more daring with this and actually show some real destitution among the dogs, but I guess this isn't supposed to be *beep* Watership Down (though I have to give major props to the Disney crew for sneaking in implications of Tramp having been a bit of a womanizer...er...bitchizer...I'm writing that word down for future use).Another thing that makes this the finest Disney movie in years is in how it reincorporates the practice of the early films in getting across moments bound to frighten any and all children. The rat is, like The Coach Man, one of those Disney villains who doesn't appear all that much, but who makes a real impression when he does. While its Frank Thomas's spaghetti eating scene that gets mentioned all the Nine Old Men tributes and framed and parodied all over the place, it's actually Wolfgang Reitherman's fight scene between Tramp and the street dogs that is probably the best piece of animation here. Despite the inevitable lack of blood, there's a genuine ferocity here that almost makes the viewer think there is. As always, though, every piece of animation is excellent from a performance standpoint.This was the first film Disney made in cinemascope, but rather than using it to create a spectacle like Peter Pan, what we have here is a film about characters reacting to their environment. The larger than life backgrounds, beautifully composed especially considering the difficulties of working in a new aspect ratio, create an environment to rival the early work. Now, just wait for the kind of crazy *beep* Disney was to pull off with Sleeping Beauty.As a whole product, this is the first Disney work since Bambi that feels complete. It's not just a series of fun moments, but a total story that makes an impression and invites sympathy for its characters. And, at the end, the viewer feels satisfied. I can't quite put it on the level of Bambi or Pinocchio, since it doesn't quite reach the visceral or atmospheric heights of the early work, but it comes very close and deserves its iconic status in Disney's canon. For a while, Disney would in fact be on a brief upward trajectory."
75,Lady and the Tramp,10,20 November 2009,A perfect love story,"I don't understand why critics had a very negative view on this movie! It's full of beauty! The songs, the characters, and of course the story is just perfect! I just love the scenes in this-Especially Belle Notte(a.k.a The spaghetti scene).I adore the song 'He's A Tramp'. It is literally one of the best Disney songs for sure! Well anyway, Lady And The Tramp is one of the best of Disney's work! In fact, I think it was the best film he had done in the 1950's! 10/10 no doubt. Simply perfection."
76,Lady and the Tramp,9,29 October 2009,Even I Have Got it Pretty Bad...,"I am not the world's biggest fan of talking animals, but Lady and the Tramp is priceless. Perhaps it is because they are characterized so faithfully and fleshed out so well, I forget that they aren't really human. After all, isn't that how we begin to treat our pets?In choosing a plot that he infused with his own experiences, I think Disney did a superb job- much better than some adaptations of famous classics. Keeping the story strictly to a dog's point of view was a wonderful decision- it kept things from getting silly or overly- cartooney.As usual, I cannot fault the animation of the film- it is truly lovely and harmonizes with the elegance of the Victorian period. The characters are wonderfully captured and seamlessly integrate human characteristics in a dog's body. The musical numbers stand out strikingly in the film- the haunting ""What is a baby"" always creeped me out, while the lullaby was wonderfully warm. The Siamese cat song was utterly terrifying yet somehow mesmerizing. ""Bella Notte"" was, of course, a knock-out, but the best song was ""He' a Tramp."" Peggy Lee was an outstanding talent, providing the voice of the cats, Darling and Peg.As far as the story goes, its actually very interesting. The cats and the rat are very VERY creepy- I always get surprised thinking about how nightmarish Disney films can turn. The whole plot line of Ladies and Tramps went over my head as a youngster, but looking on it now, its kinda racy if you applied the standards to humans. Lady was pretty much stamped deflowered after spending the night out with Tramp, regardless of whatever may or may not have happened (think about what exactly Jock and Trusty were proposing in the latter half). But who could really blame her for digging on Tramp- he's a scoundrel, but they love him!Quote of the Film: We are Siamese if you please. We are Siamese if you don't please."
77,Lady and the Tramp,10,30 December 2007,"The View of things from some Anthopromorphic Canines, Felines and others; leading to the ""Bella Note"" together.","Mr. Walt Disney's full length animated feature films have come to be declared to be ""a Classic"" by the time of their re-release. The custom of bringing out a film for general release every so often is not a concept that was peculiar to or originated by Disney.There were companies with names such as Reel-Art and Dominant, which devoted their whole reason for being just for activity of releasing old films for another go-round. As we said before, Disney didn't invent the idea; but they sure did a Lion's Share of this business with their own productions.LADY AND THE TRAMP (Walt Disney Prod. /Buena Vista, 1955) The critics and the movie going public went for it.It was probably the first Disney Animated Feature to get the full promotional build-up by way of the ""DISNEYLAND""(ABC 1954-61, NBC '61-'81, CBS '81-83, other Cable '81-900 weekly TV Show on the American Broadcasting Company Television Network.Typically a program was to highlight one particular aspect or big development in the animation Arts & Sciences. The episode would have a Lion's share of its time devoted to this ""new project"". In this case we saw behind the scenes musical numbers and voices as done by Miss Peggy Lee and The Mellow Men singing group.Handled improperly, could be interpreted in a hostile manner. But, no one seemed to mind and the 1950's audience seemed to enjoy those ""behind the scenes"" episodes as much as any.* The Disney people did a fine job of assembling a team of voice actors. Underscoring the story was the original score, with original songs composed by Sonny Burke and Miss Peggy Lee. OUR STORY.It is right around 1900 in a large American City. A young newly married couple living in one of those huge Victorian Houses receives a Christmas present of a Cocker Spaniel puppy, a female, whom they name ""Lady."" As much as they promise to each other to train the Dog and keep her from being ""spoiled"", they gradually give in to the puppy's whining.In a scene that tells it all, they agree to let the little Doggie sleep in their bed at the foot of their mattress, for just the first night. The scene ends with the Pup astride their mattress and it quickly dissolves into the image of a full-grown Lady in the same position.We are introduced to neighbor dogs. Jock is a Scottish Terrier and Trusty, a Bloodhound. They, being much older, are often times called upon for counseling by the young Lady for advice. Lady was shocked to suddenly be relegated and referred to as just ""that Dog"", and discovers that the family is going to have an addition. Soon after wards, a bright-eyed bouncing baby boy joins their domicile.Their elderly Aunt Sarah and her Twin Siamese Cats'come for a visit. The Cats' behaviour leads to a ""frame job"" on Lady; dubbing her as a vicious corr. Aunt Sarah gets her a muzzle.Lady gets out of their yard,across the tracks and into a tough part of town. There it is that she meets up with the Tramp, who saves her from 3 tough stray curs. Getting a Beaver at the City Zoo to chomp off her muzzle, they spend a night on the town.Because Tramp is alone, wild and carefree, he can choose what ever ethnic cuisine he chooses from what ever family or restaurant; where he is known by various names, depending on the ethnicity. This evening he chooses Tony's for its Italian dishes. Tony and his assistant, Joe serenade the pair to accordion and mandolin instrumentals while they harmonize ""Bella Note"" under the moonlit city sky.Lady winds up temporarily in the City Dog Pound, where she meets up with a colorful group, including Peg, who had known Tramp before and sings ""He's a Tramp"".** With her collar and dog license, she is soon reunited with Aunt Sarah and returns home.Because she spent the night out with the male, Tramp, we are privy to a conversation between Jock and Trusty, both willing to marry Lady to spare her the disgrace. Could it be that she could be in family way after being out all night? After all, they did visit a Lovers' Lane, and in this Victorian era, well it was highly disgraceful behaviour and even an unspeakable act and condition being expectant out of wedlock.Tramp returns to Lady's home and in saving the baby from a rat that had crawled into the nursery from the outside woodpile, he is thought to have been after the infant. He is hauled off to the Dog Pound. The young couple returns, the dead rat carcass is found, Tramp is freed to live as Lady's mate.We fade out with the next Christmas. Tramp is now settled down. He and Lady now have a family, 3 females looking like Lady, and one male pup that is the spittin' image of Tramp.NOTE: * WARNER BROTHERS PRESENTS, THE 20th CENTURY-FOX HOUR and MGM PRESENTS all plated that same plugola game as Disney, but none did it so well and the public always had a special pedestal for Walt and Company.NOTE: ** Though the trip to the Dog Pound was an overall comical sequence, there is one grim moment when one of the Dogs is taken to be killed. Just an example of the little bit of fright that seemed to be inherent in all Disney Pix. Furthermore, it may be that inclusion of a scene like this may stimulate the increase of dog rescues and adoptions."
78,Lady and the Tramp,,16 January 2007,Back when Disney had true Magic,"Just recently I was given the DVD of Lady and the Tramp. The one and only time that I had seen this movie was when I was a kid, and had not seen it since. As a kid, I was like a lot of other kids in that anything that resembled a cartoon, immediately got my attention. I remember seeing this movie years ago and being thrilled by the fun and humor of its characters.Now I for one do not make a regular practice of collecting children's movies and the main reason for that is because of the consistent disappointments that have come from the Disney studios in the past several years. I have never subscribed to the idea that adults can't enjoy an animated feature because its a cartoon -- and that children can not appreciate a good simple live action feature film. But much like feature films with real actors, the animated entries have also gone by the formula that - special effects is everything - this I do not subscribed to at all. Though the recent features that have come from Disney have been turned over to CGI experts and the work that goes into these animated films are a feat in itself, many of them still lack the simple ingredient of charm and beauty that Lady and the Tramp has. For the first time in over thirty years I watched this movie and was stunned that it still had the same effect on me. I'm grateful that in all the years of living in the cynical world of adults, it has not tainted my appreciation for something simple and beautiful - the very elements that kids eyes see the world through. The wonderful Italian café ""bella notte"" scene is still magical, and much to my surprise I actually hear adults still talk about that scene and almost blush -- ""It's so romantic."" (the most talk-about scene in a Disney film next to perhaps the scene in Dumbo or Bambi) and I do not know of any adult who has seen this film recently or since childhood that can sit through it and not be touched by it.Today's animated features are chocked full of digital wizardry and voiced by multi-millionaire movie stars. It seems that half the intent for these film makers are - trying to put as many box office stars voices in one film. They're not focusing on entertaining the kids but rather impressing the kids' parents, with special effects and having them play the game of guessing they're favorite film stars voices. Lady and Tramp is a testimonial for good, fun entertainment that can come from a talented group of artists, animators, voice actors and script writers, in the what would now be called the - ""old way.""If these kinds of kids movies are indeed a ""time piece"" and now considered a ""thing of the past"" then its sad that the film industry has lost sight of what's good entertainment for kids. And if children these days have become so high-tech like the rest of our world that sitting down and watching a CGI-less cartoon is not visually stimulating enough, than as several people including some fellow-commentors say - ""the good ol' days are gone."" and they truly ""don't make them like they used to."""
79,Lady and the Tramp,10,15 October 2006,A beautiful masterpiece,"I saw this film when I was very little and I have to say, even today, it is my favourite film of all time. You can stick your romantic modern day romances for a minute and see this beautiful masterpiece of a Disney film. Two dogs that fall in love, ones from a rough background- ones from a posh underside. Its sweet (with a few funny laughters) a few traumas that make you want o watch the film even more. Cant there be an even more perfect film?? Don't think so. A film like this reminds us of what Disney films USED to be! Me and my little cousin loved this film and thought it was brilliant. We always watch when there's nothing on at the movies. Go buy it- NOW!!"
80,Lady and the Tramp,10,30 July 2006,"Romantic, nice, cute, fun!!!!!","Disney goes into CinemaScope(TM) here in 1955 with this great family animated film ""Lady and the Tramp,"" best known for the scene where the two pups eat spaghetti together! (Sadly, my location didn't show that part last time it was shown on ABC because a storm was brewing here!!!!! Darn!) But, I've seen this movie before, so that really isn't a problem, right?What I like about this film: that it's unforgettable. We have a good story, great animation, unforgettable parts, and much more. I love it, my mother loves it, every family loves a good film like this!!!!!""Lady and the Tramp"" is also in a new 2-disc DVD set, where not only can you see this in CinemaScope(TM), but play games, learn more about this movie, and a whole lot more!!!!! Enjoy the film; you won't regret it!!!!!10 stars."
81,Lady and the Tramp,,8 September 2000,One of Walt Disney's great masterpieces,This classic shows the Disney skill at giving human attributes to animals and not seeming the least bit ridiculous.  The result is that the audience cares very much about the animal stars.  That is especially so in this movie because of the timeless and beautifully done story line.  The movie is enhanced by beautiful scenery and beautiful music.  I have had the video for years and consider it one of my treasures.
82,Lady and the Tramp,10,15 May 1999,The BEST Disney movie of all time!!!,"This is the age old love story of the rich girl falling for the wild ladies man from across the tracks.... yet in Walt Disney's style. The girl is Lady a cocker spaniel, and the man is Tramp a mongrel. You'll follow Lady with her ""rich"" friends and Tramp with his ""living on the edge friends"" and how these two wonderful dogs manage to come together. It's truly the most beautiful, sweet, and well crafted Disney movie ever. Don't miss this wonderful film."
83,Lady and the Tramp,8,2 January 2013,"Great movie, bit overrated","Its a good movie and certainly a classical, there is something about Lady's character which i admire, just the way she presents herself. Also I find it funny how she acts when she is presented with something new and I also like the old time atmosphere to it. Love plot is overrated, not much to it almost seems as if Lady just agree to be with Tramp because she had no one else. I didn't even know she was interested in Tramp until the last 10 minutes of the movie when she told Tramp to get lost and when he left she looked back, up until then it just looked like she was going along with Tramp. Maybe it is because I didn't grow up with the movie compared to most people but It is still a really interesting movie to someone who wouldn't dare considering to watching a movie like this. But it is still an amazing movie. Good job to the actor that played Lady and Tramp, they could have picked two better actors. The actor was one of the best I've seen in a long time. Music for me was between passable and sweet. They have to make more movies with the old time, more romantic feel to it."
84,Lady and the Tramp,8,1 December 2006,OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG.....I love this movie.,"I watched this movie, what, once when I was little? didn't care for it ALL that much. Then, years later, my seventeen birthday rolls around. i see the commercials for the PE version of this movie on TV. I mention the cuteness factor to my best friend and BAM. My 17th birthday present. I watched it, expecting to be like ""oh, okay."" but was i like ""oh, okay.""? NO! I LOVEEEEEEEEEED IT!! It sparked my newfangled Disney obsession. now i am searching for all Disney platinum edition DVDs that are OOP.....this movie... is amazing. BRILLIANT! its beautiful. the characters... it just has this wonderful hometown feel to it.this movie always brings a smile to my face and love to my heart!"
85,Lady and the Tramp,,7 February 2010,Lady and the Tramp; or the battle between freedom and family?,"The Disney factory (using the word factory is an accurate representation) has been creating childhood favorites since the early 30s  and continue to push the boundaries of animation for children today with partnering with the hugely popular PIXAR as well as their most recent outing, ""The Princess and the Frog"". There is no child growing up today that doesn't know the name Mickey Mouse in some form or another  and that is an impressive feat for any studio. With that said, Disney's normal focus is animating classic fairy tales like ""Pinocchio"" or ""Cinderella"" or ""Snow White"", but sometimes they take a classic tale and rework it using common household animals. That is the case with ""Lady and the Tramp""; my first Disney animated film to review. It is the infamous tale of young rapscallion winning the heart of a wealthy woman, but now instead of people  we have dogs. Made in 1955, this was probably another groundbreaking work for Disney, but watching it now in 2010, it has the feeling of being rushed, underdeveloped, and weak on story. So, I ask again  could Disney have created a film that was merely ""mediocre""? We begin with Lady being given to Darling as a gift one Christmas. She is an obnoxious puppy who desires the attention of her owners. Through years of gift giving and love, she finds comfort in the normality of their life. This is all about to change as our nuclear family decides to add another bundle of joy to the mix. With skepticism abound, Lady learns to love the changes and the new family. It is about this time that Tramp enters the picture. Representing the care-free, baby-less, lifestyle of living without a collar, he demonstrates the power of a small community, but also shows us (the viewers) the darkness surrounding this town. On the run from both the Pound and a sordid past, he eventually runs into Lady and one could say, ""it was love at first sight"". As Darling and Jim Dear embark on a trip, an unknown relative comes to stay with two typecast Siamese cats. Songs, chases, and rats round out this story, that goes from light to bleak to dark again as Disney creates this seemingly dystopian world for the child audience.I am aware that we all know the story, but the recap was needed to show a point about Disney's use of class and status in this film. As a casual viewer, many will argue that this is just a children's film  leave it be, but these are the images surrounding our children. Lady comes from an upper class family, with no worry of consequence; she and her friends go through the day oblivious to the world around them. Tramp, coming from the other side of the tracks (literally) represents the middle-to-lower class people. He finds friendship in the shop owners and transients of this town. What impressed me about this film was how dark and ill-created the lower part of town was, and Disney isn't afraid to show it. The dirt roads, the black (or darkened) buildings, the fact that a storm arrives just as they head to town; it is night whenever Lady is away from her house. Let's not forget as well, the rat comes out of a hole with a poster for the circus right above. This demonstrates another transient profession that is somehow darkened by this film. The stark use of light and dark in this film is used not only for tone, but also a world outside of the white picket fences and collars.What is the impression handed to children with this imagery? If you want children or the house with the white picket fence, or safety  you need to be like Lady. While if you want to see the world, experience life without a collar, one would need to live like Tramp. What makes this reality odd is Tramp's choice? To see this point clearer, look at Tramp's ""friends"". Where are they at the end of the film? Nobody comes to visit, they could be dead (Disney handed us that bleak image near the middle of the film), while the entire time they are speaking of him as a saint and great friend. Nobody came to bail Pedro, Toughy, or Peg out. Was this the happy ending we all wanted? With the undertones exposed, how was the remainder of the film? While it carried some iconic images, the overall pacing of the film was a bit sloppy. As this is a story with two sets of eyes, we are never quite given a full story on either. Lady's story is further developed, while Tramp just seems to be inserted for merely the ""cause and effect"" storyline. The voice work was decent in this film. The 76-minute run seemed nothing like a sprint. I think it was because I cared nothing for these dogs. They were beautifully drawn, but more development was needed. The ""evil"" rat was introduced twice, and represented the darkness creeping into suburbia, but it just wasn't enough to pull Lady and the Tramp together. What did Lady really want in life? My ending question  why was she denied it? Overall, this wasn't a bad Disney movie; it just wasn't one of the greatest. I felt the symbolism was overbearing as well as the choices made to be a bit misleading for children. The characters of Lady and Tramp seemed one dimensional at times, lacking in the ability to pull me back into a second viewing. The songs were low-key and outside of the Siamese cats' duet, forgotten. Grade: *** out of *****"
86,Lady and the Tramp,,14 October 2011,Another Disney classic,"This is another one of those Disney classics that keep you on your tail. Or... whatever you have if you aren't a dog. It is basically a dog that feel betrayed when her owners have a baby, then she herself finds a dog who betrays her but in the end of the film he comes back and they have puppies and live happily ever after... right? Well yes and no. Yes it was a nice ending, however much of the drama was intense to be honest. Plus that Aunt/Mother/Relative who came over... wow she was nasty! I wanted to smack her... nah that's a bit mean... but you know! She had nasty cats who would make a mess and naturally the dog would want to defend her house but they'd run away and the AMR (Aunt/Mother/Relative) would blame her. I hate those types of 'bad guys' who are ignorant and will be cruel to the innocent.Fortunately in the end the parents told her to stop accusing the dog and ended up finding a rat. However, I was disappointed that somehow the parents didn't know about the AMR's punishment for Lady (they stopped Tramp so why not get after AMR for what she did with Lady?) and it seemed that problem was unsolved. And the poor dog which I thought had died from the crash ended up with just a broken leg... not sure how I liked this... should the dog have died or just gotten the broken leg? Anyway this movie was fairly good, seemed to be that typical type of movie from Disney. Rated 7/10."
87,Lady and the Tramp,9,12 July 2006,Lady and the Tramp,"I always thought I had seen this Disney animated film when I was younger, but when I watched it in my older age I did not recognise any moment at all, besides the Siamese cat and spaghetti eating sequences, so it was a great official first time. Basically, set near the beginning of the 20th Century, 1909, Jim Dear gave his wife Darling a sweet puppy for Christmas, a golden cocker spaniel that they name Lady, and she grows into an adorable pampered dog with a happy life. Lady's neighbourhood friends are fellow pet dogs Jock the Scottish Terrier and Trusty the bloodhound, and across town lives a dog from the opposite upbringing, stray mutt the Tramp, who lives his life moment to moment, eating scraps from an Italian restaurant, and helping his fellow stray dogs Peg the Lhasa Apso and Bull the English bulldog escape the dog catcher. Lady is sad when her owners soon start treating with less affection, her friends assure her that this is because they are expecting a baby, and Tramp passing through the neighbourhood overhears this conversation and offers his own opinions of it. She does get to meet the newborn child, and adores her, but she is left alone in the house while Jim Dear and Darling go on a trip, and also in the house are Aunt Sarah who hates dogs, and her fiendish Saimese cats Si and Am. When the cats get Lady in trouble she is taken to get a muzzle, and running away she is chased by street dogs, but Tramp rescues her, and gets a gullible beaver to bite through the muzzle straps, and he starts introducing her to the life without a collar and owner. After this Tramp takes Lady for a slap up meal at Tony's restaurant, where Tony and cook Joe prepare a delicious meal of spaghetti and meatballs, the chefs serenade with the song ""Bella Notte"", the dogs share an unintentional kiss catching the same strand of spaghetti, he rolls a meatball for her, and they end the evening with a stroll in the park. On their way back to Lady's home Tramp causes trouble getting in a chicken coop and chasing the birds, and the dog catcher gets Lady, but the other dogs there know that her collar is an instant way out, and they also reveal Tramp has had many girlfriends. When she is picked up by Aunt Sarah, she is tied up in the back yard, having to sleep through a horrible stormy night, and she refuses to talk to Tramp when she comes to apologise to her, and Jock and Trusty help get rid of him as well. Moments later Lady is shocked to see an evil and filthy looking rat running into the house, and Tramp runs back to help get rid of it and stop the baby coming to any harm, but in the process Lady manages to come back in, and the crib is knocked over. Aunt Sarah mistaking the dogs being responsible shoves Tramp in the closet and throws Lady in the basement, and Jim Dear and Darling return home just as the dogcatcher comes to take the mutt away, and Lady is let out to prove Tramp's innocence in the situation. Jock and Trusty chase after the dogcatcher's wagon to help Tramp out, and they cause it to crash, in the process Trusty is badly injured and looks dead, but the end sees him fine, Lady and Tramp are reunited, Tramp is made part of the family, and together at Christmas they have four puppies, one mutt (Scamp) and three golden cocker spaniels (Annette, Danielle, and Collette), so a happy ending. Lady is a beautiful well mannered dog, and Tramp is a lovable scruffy mongrel, the other characters are likable as well, the animation to create is superb, especially when you consider that this is one of the rare occasions that Disney creates an original story not based on a fairytale or book, like Dumbo and Bambi before. It has great music and songs, obviously ""Bella Notte"" is my favourite, and there are also ""The Siamese Cat Song"" and ""He's A Tramp"" amongst others made with the help of singer Peggy Lee, also providing some of the voices, and it is a simple concept concerning family values and a great clash of classes making a nice love story, it is a fantastic family animated musical adventure. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Film. It was number 95 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!"
88,Lady and the Tramp,6,19 May 2007,Lame Ending,"This is my opinion. There's no such thing as a great film with a terrible ending.This is the reason why ""Lady and the Tramp"" remains to me one of the worst films ever to ever some out of the Disney animation studios and be considered a ""classic"". Although I must admit, this film has always been one of those treasured classics of my youth. I thought I'd revisit the magic. An hour into it, I relived the ""magic"" all the way to the famous spaghetti scene. Disney at its best. I just didn't remember the ending, and now I know why. It was a complete and utter cop out that made no sense. From the beginning, we view Lady growing up from a frisky young pup to a sophisticated ""lady"" only to be swept off her feat and seduced by a street-wise Tramp. Their courtship lead to the inevitable, and so everything is great until Lady finds out more about her new bo, the obvious. What causes us to buy any redemption in Tramp's character? The big conclusion is, Tramp becomes a hero by defeating a challenging opponent...a rat. Before we know it, the film has cut to Lady draped over her new companion with babies. I have a hard time believing a rat would be considered a big opponent to overpower for a dog, but even if so, it doesn't excuse the lack of development in the characters, which is replaced by some lousy deus ex machina. And so there it is. The conflict is really never resolved. We see no evolution in both of the characters. That abrupt cut at the end defeats the purpose of the whole film. With some charming moments, that I'm now believing to have been motivated by some more dog-like desires, the film is a nothing film due to some bad writing. The rat doesn't help."
89,Lady and the Tramp,5,14 June 2006,"Can you ""dog"" it?","Stories of wealthy girls falling for non-wealthy boys have become so common that we sort of lose track. I don't know whether or not ""Lady and the Tramp"" was the first. But I guess that it does kinda change things knowing that among the voices here were Peggy Lee, Stan Freberg (who occasionally provided the voices of characters in Looney Tunes cartoons) and Alan Reed (best known as Fred Flintstone). Of course, a big problem is the title: ""tramp"" is sort of a derogatory word. Not that we should have expected Walt Disney to care about political correctness. If the movie has any major pluses, it's that the dinner scene has been spoofed a lot.All in all, they clearly had ""dogged"" determination here."
90,Lady and the Tramp,7,26 August 2017,"Cute one, but a little forgettable.","There are two things about Lady and the Tramp which I remembered before I watched again here in my early 20's: the famous spaghetti scene which is one of the sweetest romantic scenes ever portrayed in an animated movie. It is just iconic and unforgettable. When Lady meets the Siamese cats is also pretty funny. I have always found them a little weird, but I guess that is what makes me remember them. But that was quite it. It surprised me how much I didn't remember from the movie. That must be the explanation why I have not rated it higher. But I think that the fact that the movie is made from a dog's perspective is what makes it charming. And if you are a dog person, you will like Lady and the Tramp."
91,Lady and the Tramp,7,23 August 2017,Back to basics (dad),"Actually, being 40, i don't catch the Disney virus : so far, from the 56 existing Disney Classic Animated features, i have reviewed 5 and as a kid, i watched 5 others So, i watch 1 Disney every 4 years ! This one belongs to my Dad collection and i had - not a fabulous but a good - time with it : the first thing i noticed was that the restoration is amazing as the animation is incredibly clear with superb colors Next it's evident that the movie Garfield just steals and copies the ideas of following pets living in a same neighborhood, their way they deal with their human owners and their intrepid journey to discover what is the town beyond their front yard ! With only 73 minutes, it was the ideal duration for me because it's enough, all the more than I skip every song (never understand why animations should need those anyway). Unlike some sad ethnic hypertrophied ego, i don't find the feature racist with the Siamese cats ! However i found the message of the movie to be a bit bleak as the free tramp finally gets happy to have a collar ! Sure he has found a great love as well but emancipation is also essential !"
92,Lady and the Tramp,9,23 February 2016,A favorite for all but five years of my life,"I was four when Lady first met her Tramp. That was a lie t of years ago. Yet, to this day, I can't think of this film without both smiles and tears, and it doesn't matter that I've seen it it dozens.of times, both in theaters and my home. Because of the master storytellers at Disney's magic palace, I craved a cocker spaniel. After AfterbAfter all, what else does a little girl need?Lady and the tramp, like all of Walt Disney's films, has laughter, drama, pathos, tears, and, perhaps most importantly, a happy ending. If you have a child, it should be approached carefully because it can be a traumatic experience. I still remember what a trial it was for me to see this film the first time, and how many tissues I went through. But I cannot recommend this movie enough, because it can help a child more fully appreciate how wonderful dogs are, and how gentle care of one can help a person learn regard for all life.If you are a parent, invest in Disney films. If you are not a member of that class, invest in them for your own benefit. They are still, many, many years after my first introduction to each of them, a genuine treasure of my life. Thank you, Uncle Walt, for filling my childhood with gentle education."
93,Lady and the Tramp,9,7 February 2015,Somehow this one has been a bit forgotten....,"Among the long list of classic Disney full-length cartoons, I am pretty sure a lot of folks have forgotten ""Lady and the Tramp"". It just never achieved the same level of love and acceptance of films like ""Cinderella"", ""Snow White"" or ""Bambi"". This does NOT mean, however, that it's a bad film. In fact, I would rate this as one of the best Disney films of the 1950s--every bit as good as ""Peter Pan"" and ""Cinderella"". So why is this? Well, I think the biggest reason is marketability. If you are the Disney Corporation, it's easy to make and market toys and stuffed animals for many of their films but this really was never done much with ""Lady and the Tramp"". Most folks are most likely to want to spend their money on Mickey watches, Minnie stuffed animals or dressing their girls up as Disney princesses. Most won't buy their kid a stuffed cocker spaniel or a watch with some nasty Siamese cats on it!The film has a lot going for it. The animation is just lovely, the songs quite good and the story bursts with charm. In fact, I would say that I like it more than many of the classic Disney films. What's not to like about this film?!"
94,Lady and the Tramp,,9 June 2012,"Surprisely, another good Disney film that I actually really like!","The first person to catch interest in this was my 10 year old sister, Gabby. I borrowed her copy of the film on DVD, to watch by myself. At first I didn't like it. But, I decided I should give it a re-watch. And now, I love it. Here's what I think of it. Negatives: There's a lot of awkward edits to the film. Can be very weird sometimes. The Humans are Pointless. Positives: Lovely Soundtrack, Great Animation, nice, and simple story, it's pretty funny at times. keeps you entertained. Overall, Lady and the tramp, is a excellent movie that should not be missed. However, it does not beat my favorites, Bambi, Rio, or The Secret of NIMH, Surf's Up, and others. So, 9/10."
95,Lady and the Tramp,10,21 June 2011,Bella Note,Lady in the Tramp is no doubt one of Walt Disney's greatest movies.Poor Lady finds out that her darlings are going to have a baby. Lady obviously becomes nervous about the whole ideal after hearing stories of being ignored from some of her friends Jock and Trusty. Lady anxiously awaits the arrival of the new bundle.While the darlings leave at some point they leave Lady in the care of a relative who also comes along with her trouble causing Siamese Cats. Naturally the curious kitties start trouble and Lady unfortunately becomes the one accused of causing the raucous and she's forced to wear a muzzle after barking too much. Poor dog.Lady escapes and runs across a ragged tramp named Tramp. They go on some adventures and have lots of fun and some troubles along their way. And of course the wonderful night with the spaghetti and meatballs scene.The only thing I didn't like about the movie is when the rat tries to harm the baby. I'm sorry but I don't think most rats are looking to come into someone's house at night to do harm to a defenseless child. Maybe it would have made more sense if it was one of the cats. Other than that a wonderful family film.
96,Lady and the Tramp,9,1 January 2008,"Disney's Best ""Puppy-Love"" Story","Lady and the Tramp brings back good memories to anyone he grew up with it. It's cuteness and simplicity make it beautiful The storyline is short, sweet and to-the-point, leaving plenty of space for the wonderfully-made characters, memorable voice performances, gorgeous animation and great music ( Ranging from the smooth, jazzy "" He's a Tramp"", the contemporary ""Siamese Cat Song, and the lovely Italian ballad ""Bella Notte""). Let us remember a certain spaghetti scene where two dogs fall in love thats been played over in Hollywood for years..... So don't be fooled by the sweet first impression, this movie has substance to it, 2 Thumbs Up!"
97,Lady and the Tramp,9,22 July 2007,A Very Nice Movie   SPOILERS,This is a great children's' movie.It all begins when a woman called Darling gets a puppy for Christmas. Darling calls the puppy Lady. The puppy has two friends named Jock and Trusty. The puppy meets two naughty Siamese cats that make a big mess and blame it on Lady. Then Lady's aunt puts a muzzle on her. Lady meets Tramp who she really likes. Lady and Tramp have spaghetti. You will have to watch it to find out what happens next. Anyways I liked this movie. This is definitely one of the great Disney movies ever. It is a classic that should watch.9/10
98,Lady and the Tramp,10,9 January 2007,What kind of horse?,"What kind of horse is in Lady and the Tramp that has an unusually shaped face? All my life I thought it was a caricature of a horse. But when we went to Holland I was surprised to see one just like it. If anyone knows what kind of horse it is, please let us all know. It's the horse that's a friend with all the dogs. I don't believe it's the one pulling any carriages, but it might be. Could it simply be an old horse? Or a cross? But I've never seen an old horse in America like it. I don't know what the horses name was. It's been a long time since I've seen the movie. I'm anxious to know what kind of horse it was. Very beautiful!"
99,Lady and the Tramp,10,29 December 2006,My favorite animation of all time.,"This is classic Disney in the best sense of the term. The Disney studios, during the 1940's and 50's had a magic that has yet to be repeated, but ""Lady And The Tramp"" is my favorite. Yes, I am a 'dog lover' but even if I weren't I think I would feel just as strongly about this title.This movie is both charming and entertaining. The animation is technically superb, the voice-overs are excellent and the story line is quite memorable. The music, too, is top-notch! What more could you want? For me, it is one of those most excellent artifacts from an era gone by, a work of art and entertainment that captured the essence of what was best about the 1950's."
100,Lady and the Tramp,10,16 June 2006,One of Disney's best animated features!,"This is an example of Disney at their greatest! It has wonderful characters, extremely detailed backgrounds, and witty songs written by Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee. It also has an simple story, about a pampered cocker spaniel named Lady who falls in love with Tramp, a mutt from the wrong side of the tracks. The scene in which Lady and Tramp share a candlelight spaghetti dinner is one of Disney's most memorable. This is a film everyone should see. Recommended. NOTE: This film is now available in a Platinum Edition DVD, including games, featurettes, galleries, and two versions of the film (it was originally shot in the then popular CinemaScope)."
101,Lady and the Tramp,10,14 June 2006,A dog's tale that is worth wagging about.,"Over the years, the technology of animation has evolved quite nicely, replacing hand-drawn illustrations with more realistic computer-enhanced renditions.While these blend better into our highly demanding high-tech medium, they simply cannot capture the magic and essence of the classic cartoons that many of us can be proud to say we've had the opportunity to grow up with.While a cartoon, the film could just as easily be effective as a live-action romance, as it presents many human-based elements, the primary one here, being the distinction between social classes and forbidden love.Darling and Jim Dear are a happily-married upper class couple who are seen enjoying a beautiful Christmas morning, when Jim presents his wife with the gift of an elegant cocker spaniel pup, whom they decide to name Lady.Overtime, Lady becomes quite spoiled and pampered by her new owners, and soon, she begins wearing a new collar and license, an accessory that she is very proud of showing off to the neighborhood dogs.Lady becomes quite comfortable within her life with the Dear family, but then, an unexpected event arrives with the pregnancy of Darling.From that point on, Lady begins feeling neglected as the busy couple are seen making preparations for their impending arrival, and she worries that they will get rid of her to make room for the baby.Once the baby is born, Lady finds herself warming up to the new addition of the family, but soon, she experiences another upheaval when evil Aunt Sarah arrives to care for the child while Jim and Darling are away.Aunt Sarah doesn't want Lady anywhere near the baby, and to make matters worse, she has even brought along her two trouble-making Siamese cats.After Aunt Sarah puts a muzzle on Lady, she runs away and finds herself into a shadier neighborhood where she is rescued by Tramp, a streetwise mutt who spends his time evading the net of the dog catchers, and begging for scraps of food in the back alley of an Italian restaurant.Tramp takes Lady under his care, and begins teaching her about the ways of an unsheltered life, and predictably, they fall in love.The film offers highly engaging and distinctive characters, memorable musical sequences, as well as one of the most romantic scenes in movie history, as Lady and Tramp share a spaghetti dinner.Simply put, it is a time-enduring masterpiece that can either be viewed as a date movie by adults, or by a family looking to enjoy a movie night with the kids."
102,Lady and the Tramp,10,18 March 2006,Lady and the Tramp,When I heard that Lady and the Tramp would become available on DVD I was thrilled.I saw this movie as a 7 year old child with my Grandmother and Mother on a very special outing that I still remember to this day.I now have a 2 year old granddaughter of my own. My wife purchased this movie for me and I cried all the way through it. My plan is to watch it a few more times then present it to my daughter and granddaughter.It is a wonderful story about love and taking care of those that you do love.On a scale of 1-10 I rate it a 15
103,Lady and the Tramp,10,5 March 2006,Lady and the Tramp,"I think that this movie is a classic.A real good family film. For people that love family films this is a movie for you. The movie is great for kids and adults. I think it's a must see. The reason why they remade it was because it was so good, the just wanted to make the movie even better by fixing the color. After watching this movie it makes you want to watch the sequel. Everyone will love this movie. It will be remembered for generations to come. I gave this movie a ten because most people can in some way relate to this story. The story of how two animals fall in love and go through hardships but still manage to end up together in one big happy family. This movie says that people shouldn't judge other people for what they have heard and that love conquers all."

105,Lady and the Tramp,10,9 February 2006,Lady and the Tramp Look-a-like competition!,"From Wednesday 8 February, visitors to www.mad4dogs.org.uk/lady will have the chance to vote for their favourite doggy double act in the 'Lady and the Tramp' look-a-like competition.

106,Lady and the Tramp,9,19 January 2006,Absolutely charming Disney masterpiece,"In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, Aunt Sarah (voice of Verna Felton) was an absolute b****. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, Lady (voice of Barbara Luddy) and Tramp (voice of Larry Roberts) made a cute couple. In addition, I didn't like the way that Jock (voice of Bill Thompson) treated Tramp for the most part. To me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely charming Disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it."
107,Lady and the Tramp,,16 March 2001,A comparison of dog shows,"I have recently seen ""Lady And The Tramp"" again and it is illustrative of why I prefer Bluth's films to Disney's.  The Bluth film in this instance is ""Balto"", another dog romance but with a harder edge.""Lady And The Tramp"" is set in suburbia in the Teens, a favourite time and place for Disney.  Everything is safe and sane in Disney's suburbia of the Teens, and the streets and alleyways are clean even on the wrong side of the tracks.  The Tramp is a nice guy despite his vagabond ways; in fact, so are all the pound dogs.  The only real villains are the Aunt and her cats (and the rat, of course).""Balto"", conversely, is set on the last American frontier.  Balto is also a nice guy, but is set under much harsher conditions.  Unlike Tramp, who is a dog amongst dogs despite being a mongrel, Balto is a pariah even among the street dogs because he is not merely a mongrel, but half-wolf.The crisis in ""Lady and the Tramp"" revolves around an ""anti-dog"" babysitting aunt and her two cats, and is generally quite light, of little consequence compared to an epidemic amongst children.  Tramp's moment of heroism is to save a baby from a rat (which the cats could have done just as well, if not better...).  Balto, however, must save the sled team sent to get the medicine to save the children, and face society's scorn, the dangers of the wild, Steel's treachery, and his own self-doubt, to do so.Lady is also a quite vapid creature compared to Jenna.  Jenna is also a middle-class dog, but is not quite the innocent that Lady was (Nome, Alaska, is a harder place than middle-American suburbia of the teens) and is rather stronger than Lady, to the point of saving Balto from a bear attack.In short, ""Lady and the Tramp"" is a nice enough children's tale.  Balto is an epic.  I prefer epics."
