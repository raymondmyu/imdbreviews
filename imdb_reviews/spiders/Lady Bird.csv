0,Lady Bird,9,4 January 2018,Saoirse Ronan shines,Saoirse Ronan has the ability to get the viewer's sympathy like no other actress. Her sweetness just makes all she is going through so much more involving and moving. The subject matter is a young girl in high school discovering relationships with boys and struggling with her very strange mother played by the excellent Laurie Metcalf. Things like this have been done before but never quite so lucidly. Watching her deal with her gay boy friend then the douche bag boy friend then her difficult mother are played out in such a spontaneous manner with very well written natural sounding dialog. Makes you want a part 2.
1,Lady Bird,8,27 December 2017,eight for great,"Lady Bird is a good indie movie. The cast is great, especially the lead.
Thank you Greta, for making a ninety minute movie! I give it eight coz it is excellent. I take away two stars because of cliched identity politics and because of Lady Bird's Mom who keeps referring to hers and others social status."
2,Lady Bird,9,18 December 2017,Character Is The Thing,"How refreshing and invigorating to meet new people. Familiar and new all at the same time. Familiar because the extraordinary Saorise Ronan connected me to her soul, as soon as she appeared on the screen. Remarkable. She is, without question, one of the best actresses of her generation. She has exceptional support here, Laurie Metcalf as the mother determined to keep her feelings at bay, Lucas Hedges, providing one of the most moving, truthful moments in the film and allowing Saorise Ronan to give us a masterful class in empathy. Timothee Chalamet proves in a very short space of time that he is here to stay. His Elio in Call Me By your Name will be considered one of the great breakthrough performances in film history. Tracy Letts plays the father with irresistible humanity and then, of course, a heartfelt congratulations to the writer, director Greta Gerwing -"
3,Lady Bird,7,11 January 2018,Inspiring Film for Teenagers,"""Lady Bird"" is an inspiring film for teenagers and practically the directorial debut the unknown Greta Gerwig, who is also the writer of this sensitive coming of age story. Saoirse Ronan has wonderful performance in the role of Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson, a teenager with typical adolescent problems. Troubled relationship with her mother and siblings; high-school pranks; romance; sex; disappointments with boyfriends and friends; financial problem; dream on going to college and improving life, all these elements are realistically explored by Greta Gerwig, maybe based on her personal experiences in Sacramento. The optimist conclusion with the growth of Christine is another plus in this original film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Lady Bird: É Hora de Voar"" (""Lady Bird: It Is Time to Fly"")"
4,Lady Bird,,4 November 2017,Sweet coming of age story with quirks,"Greta Gerwig has been an ""it"" girl on the indie scene for several years. It may be a bit ironic that her most acclaimed movie would come when she stepped behind the camera with LADY BIRD (she previously co-directed NIGHTS & WEEKENDS, and co-starred as well). Here, Saorise Ronan is the stand-in Gerwig as a character named Christine, who like the real Gerwig, is a rebellious teen in Sacramento California who dreams of New York City.Christine has re-dubbed herself ""Lady Bird"" and is going to a Catholic High School and is going through all the usual growing pains. Grewig has made a name for herself with her quirky characters and there's more than a bit of that to wade through here. It takes some time to get past the notion that Ronan is giving her own performance here and not just doing a Greta act (similar to many a Woody Allen lead performance by 'substitute' Woodys). As fiercely individualistic as Gerwig is as an actress, Ronan gives Lady Bird a bit of a softer and more vulnerable side that is more effective than if Gerwig had performed it herself. Kudos to her for embracing it.Most importantly, Gerwig does an excellent job at keeping the movie rolling along at a brisk 93 minutes, with some scenes being literally seconds long - nothing self-indulgent here (although there is a scene or two that could have been allowed to breathe a bit). The cast, including several young actors is uniformly fine. Laurie Metcalf as her tough mother could have used a little leavening. As written and performed, she comes off a bigger harridan than is what was likely intended. Some of the offbeat mumblecore touches stick out as unnecessary, but, what separates LADY BIRD from so many of them (including, frankly, a number of Gerwig's movies), is that there is genuine heart and compassion here, not just ironic detachment. Further grounding things is a keen appreciation of middle class life with the scenes of shopping at thrift stores, window browsing for homes they can't afford etc. - or, as Lady Bird sardonically refers to it: ""Coming from the wrong side of the tracks."" Credit, too, for not ending in the conventionally expected way. Just a warm sigh."
5,Lady Bird,8,26 October 2017,A Meditation on Place and Family,"Lady Bird was very well-received at its local premiere at the Paramount Theater for the Austin Film Festival. I found it to be a sweet, charming coming-of-age film. It is a serious film, but with flashes of humor. Greta Gerwing wrote and directed the film which seemed to be partly autobiographical in that she grew up in Sacramento, CA at about the same time as her character. The film is a meditation on what it means to be from some place and what that idea of home means in shaping who you become. She has a love-hate relationship with her city, her family and her place in both. It is also very much a story of young girl struggling with her own and her mother's expectations for herself. The script is really charming with the best scenes being those of Lady Bird and her mother. Lady Bird is struggling with sexuality, family, friendship, religion and even her own name all at the same time. Like all of us, she is trying to find her place in the world. Saoirse Ronan is excellent as Lady Bird as is Laurie Metcalf in the role of her haggard struggling mother trying to hold her family together through difficult times. Recommended to those who like drama, particularly coming-of-age films."
6,Lady Bird,6,19 November 2017,Mothers and Daughters and growing up in Sacremento.,"Greta Gerwig, usually disappoints me - as an actress and now in her writing and directorial debut, LADY BIRD, a coming-of-age film about a seventeen-year-old girl growing up in Sacramento ""the Midwest of California"" (the best line in the film,) and the love/hate relationship she has with her working-class family and peers. Social distinctions figure prominently in Gerwig's cinematic world of ""ironic class strivers."" I keep wondering why I am left cold by her words and her characters and eventually understood that LADY BIRD is too self-consciously trying to be inclusive - inclusive of every contemporary issue - touching upon a diversity of characters and situations with momentary episodic flashes.The touch is light, illustrating concerns rather than delving into them, giving us tokenism - glossing over deep pain and longing with a CliffsNotes diminution.Saoirse Ronan is excellent as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson - a nickname she gives herself to appear distinctive. I am sympathetic to the aspirations of a young, self- involved teenager searching for a path to glamour and excitement. Youth is an innocent time - one open to endless fantasies - reality has not yet penetrated the hermetic world of dreams. The ""firsts"" of the teen years - first kiss, first sexual experience leading to the loss of virginity, first self-awareness of one's own ethical and moral values, and the critical realization that the world is not always spinning for you alone - solely for your personal gratification.The film opens with Lady Bird and her mother - a wonderful performance by Laurie Metcalf - who is driving and listening to Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath on audio tape - both simultaneously weeping, moved by the beauty of the spoken words; their mirrored responses reflect their enduring affection. And suddenly the mood is shattered and we see the other side of their relationship - a mother who works double shifts as a psychiatric nurse to supplement the family income so that her daughter can go to a private Catholic school; the burden of monetary expenses weighs heavily on her shoulders. The ever-present resentment that comes with sacrifice is often unleashed on her oblivious daughter in a torrent of sarcasm, humiliation, and disparagement.Greta Gerwig is at her best in the scenes between mother/father and daughter. A lovely tenderness exists which is often choked and stifled by the exigencies of financial straits.The underpinnings are there for a truly fine movie, but in the rush to cast a wide net, Gerwig compromises her subjects' humanity, placing a veil of bromides over what could have been profound interactions. Maybe next time. I hope so."
7,Lady Bird,7,29 December 2017,Good Directorial debut !,"When you hear all the fantastic praise that a new Oscar bait film is getting, you should probably watch it. Even though I'm personally not the target audience or demographic for this film I still ended up liking the film quite a bit.The biggest accomplishment and positive in the film is the directing by Greta Gerwig, which for a first time directing is an outstanding achievement. You honestly would not be able to tell if this was directing by an all time great or a newcomer. She has done an amazing job directing the film in this regard it has no faults at all. With this being her first film she has an extremely bright and interesting future ahead and I'm definitely now keen to see what she does next. The other main positive of the film are the performances which across the board are fantastic, however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly Saoirse Ronan who is fantastic in the film and brings such heart to the character of Lady Bird. For me personally this is one of her best performances that she has done and only increases her reputation. Hopefully this will open up the door for her to get bigger roles more often, she is brilliant. The other standout in the film is Lady Bird's mother played by Laurie Metcalf, she is again incredible in the role and brings elements to her character that I think everyone will recognise in their own mother. She hopefully will get some awards buzz and maybe even a nomination.Unfortunately though and I know that this is my own personal problem and fault that I feel this is film maybe a little overrated. This is partially to due my fault because well this isn't my type of film, I know thats not the films fault. I could never really connect to the story of the film but again thats my own opinion and fault, but I can understand how and why people really do connect with the story. Lastly the film is good is just nothing amazing or ground breaking in any sense so thats where I'm a little......not disappointed...... let down by the film because I was expecting a lot more considering the praise. Overall its 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10 its a good film and its a brilliant starting point for Greta Gerwig's directing career. As well as bringing us great directing it gives us two great performances that will really leave an impression on you after watching it. However because I couldn't connect to the film that much it didn't hit me as hard as it should emotionally, but again thats my problem really not the films. Best directing Oscar Nomination?"
8,Lady Bird,10,10 January 2018,Seems to perfectly capture a time and place in a certain person's life.,"'LADY BIRD': Five Stars (Out of Five)An indie comedy-drama about a high school senior that's trying to deal with teenage life, while living with her overbearing mother in early 2000s Sacramento. The film was written and directed by first time feature filmmaker Greta Gerwig, who also co-wrote 'FARANCES HA' and 'MISTRESS AMERICA' (with director Noah Baumbach), which she also starred in. It stars Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tray Letts, Lucas Hedges, Timothee Chalamet, Beanie Feldstein, Stephen McKinley Henderson and Lois Smith. It's received unanimous rave reviews from critics so far, and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards as well. I really enjoyed it. The story is set in Sacramento, over the school year of 2002 and 2003. It revolves around a senior named Christine McPherson (Ronan), who has changed her name to Lady Bird. Lady Bird struggles to get along with her overbearing mother (Metcalf), and she applies to multiple colleges outside of Sacramento, against her mother's wishes. She also struggles to get along with the other students at her school, and romantic relationships with boys her age are especially a challenge for her. The story concludes with Lady Bird going to college, and you'll have to watch it to see where she ends up going.The movie is a great coming-of-age tale, that seems to perfectly capture a time and place in a certain person's life. Ronan is awesome in the lead, and Gerwig definitely proves she's a talented filmmaker as well. The film is funny, sweet and it touches on a lot of important issues, I think, to a young person Lady Bird's age. The relationship depicted between her and her mother is also really touching at times too. I definitely recommend it."
9,Lady Bird,7,7 January 2018,Metcalf gets the most praise in this fine fiilm about life,"Christine McPherson aka ""Lady Bird"" (Saoirse Ronan) is in her senior year in a Catholic school in Sacramento, California and desperately wants to go to a liberal college in the northeastern US. This causes conflict with her mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf).Lady Bird is someone who can be inconsiderate, selfish, insecure, good-hearted, ambitious beyond her abilities, naïve, fun, and able to redeem herself. In other words, she is a confused teenager on the cusp of adulthood and Ronan plays the part superbly.Like the recent ""Florida Project"", ""Lady Bird"" is a series of short scenes that collectively make a fine film. It has sharp directing by Greta Gerwig who also wrote the screenplay. There are also engaging sidebar stories including other characters that add greatly to the main mother-daughter conflict: the despair of losing a job later in life; financial burdens; periodic depression; the inner-conflict of being young, gay, and Catholic; the futility of social climbing; the belief that ""there"" is better than ""here"".The coming-of-age genre is so common that it's difficult to raise the bar. ""Lady Bird"" at least meets the standard and then some though it could have been more. In fairness, the two lead performances do stand out especially that of Metcalf. She shows so much push-pull with her daughter while trying to come to grips that her daughter will soon leave home. She also has the brilliant ability to let the emotions build gradually and then attempt (as we do in real life) to resist them until the attempt is futile. No wonder Metcalf is winning so many awards and award nominations. While she gives a rich performance, I believe the film would have been greater if she had been given even more screen time."
10,Lady Bird,9,15 November 2017,expert filmmaking and story telling,"Greetings again from the darkness. Joining the likes of Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Ben Affleck, Greta Gerwig proves her significance and brilliance is most apparent behind the camera, rather than in front. Her first feature film flying solo as writer and director is without a doubt, one of the year's best. Surely she has benefited from having a very talented live-in muse and mentor and partner in Noah Baumbach, but this extraordinary film is clearly Ms. Gerwig's passion project  and it's a thing of beauty (character warts and all).Ultra talented Saoirse Ronan plays Christine, aka ""Lady Bird"". She claims it's her given name  a name she gave herself. Entering her senior year of Catholic High School in Sacramento, she's the typical blend of teenage insecurity, bravado and restlessness. Her never quite satisfied mom is played by Laurie Metcalf, in what is probably her career best performance, and definitely worthy of Supporting Oscar consideration. A brilliant opening scene finds mother and daughter sharing a cry, which quickly devolves into one of the endless stream of arguments that make up half of their relationship. Their scenes together are sometimes caustic, always realistic, and likely to hit home to many mothers and daughters watching.Lady Bird is convinced she must escape 2002 Sacramento and live on the east coast, where she assumes culture thrives. This is the age where every teenager is convinced an amazing destiny awaits them  not stopping to contemplate what talent they possess that might actually contribute to society. Lady Bird is an average student who seems to dream not of greatness, but rather of some vision of life where she will be appreciated for simply being herself. So much of what happens is grounded in the reality of high school life, friendships, and family. She jumps at the chance to be friends with the ""it girl"" who controls the ""in crowd"". Leaving her lifelong best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein, Jonah Hill's real life sister) in the dust, Lady Bird finagles her way into Jenna's (Odeya Rush) inner circle of rich kids, including the cooler-than-cool Kyle (Timothee Chalamet, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME). He's the bohemian-wannabe type we've all come across. Her attraction to Kyle results in confusion over her relationship with nice guy Danny (Lucas Hedges, MANCHESTER BY THE SEA). The film touches on many familiar topics, and the script elegantly handles each piece of the puzzle and gives each character their due. Lady Bird's middle class family is going through some financial difficulties after her dad is laid off. Tracy Letts is superb as the dad who is beaten down by a life that's nearly passed him by, but he staves off his own depression just enough to provide the basic strength needed by his wife and spirited teenage daughter. Mr. Letts and Ms. Metcalf aren't TV sitcom parents carefully positioned as punchlines for clever kids, like what we typically see. The emotional bond between parents and offspring is perfectly awkward and deep. Mother and daughter have their shared escapes, while father and daughter share some secrets. There is also a complex sister-brother dynamic, as well as the common issues of school days  teenage girl self-respect, class warfare, teacher crushes, and the pressures of extracurricular activities. Lois Smith has a couple of outstanding scenes as a wise and observant nun who sees Lady Bird for who she is, and provides the necessary guidance. Welcome comedy relief is combined with an editorial statement on the ongoing reductions in funding for the arts, as the football coach (Bob Stephenson) is put in charge of the drama department.Ms. Gerwig's excellent (quasi-autobiographical) film defies traditional categorization. It's part teenage comedy, coming of age, family drama, and character study  yet it's also so much more. Have you seen much of this before? Absolutely, and it's likely at least some of this has occurred in your own life, though you may not always enjoy being reminded. What is enjoyable is watching the work of a skilled filmmaker and exciting new cinematic story teller."
11,Lady Bird,9,3 January 2018,Lady Bird Review,"Lady Bird is a film written and directed by Greta Gerwig. I just happen to watch the trailer my chance and decided to give a go for this film. After watching the film, I can say that I was quite satisfied watching this film.Plot: The film chronicles the life of Christine (Lady Bird) a student of a Catholic school in the years 2002-03.Story and direction: This film has most perfectly shown the way adolescents react to situations. The way the film has woven in the situations any adolescent faces is commendable. Lady Bird as a character has so many shades. We see her being naughty, stupid, funny and emotional. Then comes her friends. Jules is kind of that supporting friend you always have on your side no matter how wrong/right you are. Jenna is the kind of friend that you want to have because of her being so flamboyant. Then we have her so called boyfriends who were poles apart in their own different way. I being from a Catholic school could connect with the film more easily because I have been in that kind of environment. Even the teachers's characters were so beautifully woven into the story. I also liked the parents' character of Lady Bird. While the father who is mostly supportive in many of Lady Bird's ventures, the mother is the conscious one who is always sort of scared for her child. Even she reacting so rudely to Lady Bird, was a way of showing her love to her. And then the finale of the film, just put a good finish and a nice arc to Lady Bird. My only issue, and this could only be me, is that These kind of films are seen so often that one can predict as to what is going to happen.Performances: Sairose Ronan once again just delivered an applauding performance as Lady Bird. I loved her in Brooklyn (that came out 2 years ago), and still she proves that she is a force to be reckoned with. Laurie Metcalf was also great as the mother. Tracy Letts also delivers a good performance. Lucas Hedges and Timothee Chalamet were also so distinct in the roles they played. Beanie Feldstein also provided some great support to Lady Bird's character.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where the sister calls Lady Bird in her room for putting the 'Just Married with Jesus' signboard on her car and also explains her that isn't love and attention the very same thing. That dialogue resonated with me. It's because that we seek love, that we do things that bring people's attention to us. And this dialogue also applies in real life to any person who seeks to be loved.Verdict: This film is perfect for all adolescents who are going through this phase. It will very easily connect with them. Kudos to Greta Gerwig and team. I am going with a 9/10."
12,Lady Bird,,10 December 2017,"A Beautiful Movie that makes you laugh, cry and think","In a revival year for movies, one with an abundance of notable gems, Lady Bird manages to stand out in the crowd. While taking on the coming-of-age angle, which has been done to death for 30something years, direct Greta Gerwig makes this one different. She brings freshness to a stale genre by releasing a steady stream of humor, heart, and honesty. Gerwig's first solo directorial effort features the winning young actress who is also quickly becoming a veteran actress Saoirse Ronan (Brooklyn, Atonement). Ronan shines, playing a Gerwig surrogate of sorts and showcasing a flawless Sacramento accent. Named Christine McPherson by her parents, she decides to instead go by the name Lady Bird. As she calls it, her given name (she gave it to herself). Mom (Laurie Metcalf) and Dad (Tracy Letts) are both perfectly cast joys to watch. Mom and Lady Bird flip a switch between sharing joyful moments to clashing in heated ones. Sweet and supportive dad does his best to help them both, even while fighting his own depression. Best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein) is delightful to viewers and loyal to Lady Bird. In her search for her identity, Lady Bird tests out a new best friend and an ill-fitting musician boyfriend (Timothee Chalamet). She lies about herself to both of them, pretends to live in the rich neighborhood, lies about her parents, trying to seem cool. Classic high school move, one of the cliché moments. The movie isn't entirely original, but what makes it so special is that everything feels authentic, never crammed in to fit a template. The characters and problems could have come across as stale and vacuous, but they contain real depth and honesty, so they're always compelling. Lady Bird meets another boyfriend, Danny (Lucas Hedges, Manchester by the Sea), while rehearsing for the school play. He resists the temptation of sex with her, ""out of respect."" Their relationship comes to an abrupt end but not before he describes Lady Bird's mom as ""warm and scary."" While Lady Bird scoffs at this descriptor at the time, she later recognizes the truth in it. She spends so much effort preventing people from seeing her family for who they really are that she never truly sees them herself. There's something in this movie for everyone. We may not all be now, nor have ever been a pink-haired teenage girl in Sacramento, but we all know what it's like to feel unsure about who we are and who we want to be. Lady Bird covers familiar experiences, but not only the pleasant ones. It's not an ""aww"" fest. Gerwig's directs the way Lady Bird's mom parentswith toughness and care. She explores the humor and hurt with equal deft. Her movie is heartwarming and heartbreaking. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you think. Gerwig delivers a story extremely personal to her in a way that makes it feel personal to all of us. Lady Bird is a wonderous success and truly one of the year's best movies."
13,Lady Bird,9,14 December 2017,Movie Of The Year.,"Writer-Director Greta Gerwig's 'Lady Bird' is a beautiful, beautiful film & is undoubtedly ""The Movie Of The Year"" for me. This sensitive, affecting & wholly satisfying coming-of-age story, is about relationships & aspirations. Gerwig, with her god-given talent, colors up the screen with humor & gut-wrenching honesty. After all, its a personal story!'Lady Bird' Synopsis: In the early 2000s, an artistically-inclined seventeen year-old (An Oscar Bound Saoirse Ronan) comes of age in Sacramento, California.'Lady Bird' works best when it focuses on the mother-daughter dynamic. So when the protagonist, who proudly addresses herself as Lady Bird, her mother (A Stellar Laurie Metcalf), gives her a reality check. The hardworking middle-class mother lives it up for her family in Sacramento, while daughter Lady Bird wishes to dream beyond her financial circumstances. Lady Bird believes in flying away from her restricted boundaries, while her Mother is practical & fighting everyday to keep her family as one. The dynamic & the extreme contrast of the mother-daughter is what makes 'Lady Bird' so special as well as affecting. No matter how much they disagree on, for whichever matter that may be, they are eventually there for each other. While it takes a while for Lady Bird to realize that, its pretty evident how the Mother always supports her. Its pure emotion & its executed with complete honesty.Gerwig deserves an Oscar for her work here. Her Screenplay is a work of beauty, while Her Direction, is understated & effective. Gerwig, a tremendous actress in her own right, shows us her powers as a storyteller with 'Lady Bird'. Please do her proud, Academy! The Globes made a blunder recently, which should be a topic of discussion at least for the time being, or more. Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume Design, all contribute beautifully to the narrative & pay homage to Sacramento, with detail.Performance-Wise: Ronan & Metcalf are flat-out fabulous. Ronan, one of the bravest & most charming young talents working today, is priceless as Lady Bird, delivering a truly heartfelt performance, that is sure to connect with many a teens out there. Metcalf, on the other-hand, is magnificently restrained as the Mother with reality as her only option. Metcalf commands the screen & comes up with one of the years finest performances. Ronan & Metcalf, together, are a force to reckon with. Of the rest of the cast, Lucas Hedges & Timothée Chalamet leave a strong impression. Others too lend great support.On the whole, 'Lady Bird' is a Triumph! Two Big Thumbs Up!"
14,Lady Bird,10,3 January 2018,Inspiring For Young People,"I'm 21 years old and this is not my biography. It's actually a review. This movie inspired me in so many ways and turned out very personal to me. Recently, I became a fan of Greta Gerwig and to see her movie debut as a director.. just warms my heart. I've been waiting for this movie to come out for so long and I wish I could go to theatre and watch it on a big screen, but where I live.. there is no such privilege. It's not that we don't have a cinema to go to, it's just they never show something like Lady Bird. I don't know the reason why, maybe it won't pay off? But I think that is a mistake. People who even wouldn't be that interested in movies or perhaps they wouldn't know what to do with their free time and they'll decide to go to the movies and suppose they randomly choose to watch Lady Bird and then probably this movie would inspire them the same way it inspired me. People need to see this, because it deserves to be in all theaters and in all countries around the world. Why do we watch movies anyway? Well, we like to find oursevles in it. Or even the small things. Lady Bird has served its purpose and I'm definitely going to re-watch this movie for a couple of times. Oh, and how did I watched it if Lady Bird wasn't in any theaters in my city? It's a secret. Not really.
Thank you, Greta.
love :x"
15,Lady Bird,8,26 December 2017,Just can't get enough of those characters,"Greta Gerwig learned a lot of Noah Baumbach and improved those skills with this great little gem. Its a truly outstanding coming of age feature with a lot of emphasize on its characters, rather than its story which is a good thing. The film was funny, kind of sad sometimes, melancholic and had vibes of nostalgia. The screenplay was excellent and Gerwig's direction extremely solid as it depict the right edges and developed the characters and thus the film absolutely right.
Saoirse Ronan once again proves that she might be the best and most versatile actress of her generation. She turns into another wonderful performance and adds a completely new character to her resume. For sure one of the top performances. It feels like she does it with such an ease, as if she became that character. Ronan was really able to transform. Also Laurie Metcalf was outstanding. She had a lot of things going on with her and the way she made her character handle and struggle with those was also extraordinary. It was also unlike anything I have seen her doing before, far away from her usual cynical characters. 
Tracy Letts is alway great and a role like that fits him wonderfully. Lucas Hedges and Timothee Chalemet were all right but nothing special. I liked Lois Smith unconventional nun character.
The soundtrack was well chosen and at the end of the film I kind of wanted a sequel .. as I really love those characters and want to see how they turn out within the years. Gerwig should consider a TV show of them or something. I would watch it!"
16,Lady Bird,8,20 December 2017,Making the Ordinary Extraordinary,"An ordinary story about a girl who wants to be anything but that, Lady Bird's strength lies in its authenticity. Sincere performances based on a personal script, the film is so real, it's as if it isn't aware of its own message. We read it as we read life, navigating through insignificant important events and special common moments we interpret however we relate. Lady Bird is a little bit of what we are, what we want to be, and what we don't want to be, and that's why we can all find a little bit of our truth in it."
17,Lady Bird,10,20 December 2017,Simply Beautiful,"""Don't you think they're the same thing? Love...and attention?"" This is one of the countless wonderful lines in Gerwig's stunningly beautiful directorial debut Lady Bird, and it happens to perfectly encapsulate my feelings for the movie itself. A concise and encompassing capture of a high schoolers senior year, I consistently found it to be completely lovable...and at worst, comfortably enveloping. With a unique rhythm of ultra-authentic and calm-yet-rapid-fire rhythm, it's a near-perfect vision that soars at every angsty turn.
Like a lower-middle class Clueless, Lady Bird is the story of a teenage girl learning how to balance school, friends, work, college applications, boys, and family. But unlike Clueless, she doesn't benefit from trust-fund parents who can pay for her every whim. Ronan is great at the center of this world, both in the film and in her own head. However, Metcalf is the gem, playing the loving but familiarly flawed mom with an exactness and perfection rarely seen. These two strong women, and the surrounding cast, carry the entertaining and thoughtful dialogue beautifully (""Just because something looks ugly doesn't mean it's morally wrong""; ""Different things can be sad...it's not all war!""; ""You're not gonna get in a car with a guy that honks, are ya?).
Most impressive is how it so perfectly captures time: both the early 2000s era, and that specific time between childhood and adulthood. I, for one, painfully recognize myself in Lady Bird; the forced quirks, a desperation to be liked, overwhelming self-awareness, a longing to rebel against a desire to please parents. Unfortunately, our lives are rarely this funny, this moving or even this honest."
18,Lady Bird,7,27 October 2017,Love Bird.......,"Lady bird is a movie about a young woman and her struggling mother. Saoirse Ronan has done the central role of the movie. She is very free flowing actress and has transformed herself in the character of a teenage girl having full of dreams , fluency and lot of life. Her activities and reactions everything has made the movie a good comedy drama. Director Greta Gerwig has directed the movie very well.Those who likes to see comedy drama will enjoy it. It has no hard actions but it is full of small emotional fights of mind. Good to see this type of movie in this high action packed era of films."
19,Lady Bird,8,13 December 2017,"Hilarious, and sometimes sad, observation on life from a high schooler's POV","Lady Bird, like many movies on high school kids, awkward relationships and coming-of-age tales, is a hilarious look on life and the wonders of the world that we all face. Female-driven and downright funny, Lady Bird stands alone because it does not try to own the idea that the film is solely about women and women only. Sure, there are mother/daughter scenes that my girlfriend related with more but the dialogue is so well written, that it forced me to transport back to my own high school days and conversations with my mother during that time period of my life. The film does an amazing job of presenting the world from Christine's, aka Lady Bird's point-of-view, while showing the real memories, hardships, lessons and choices made during these strange years of our lives. I had a friend in high school whose mother might as well have played Lady Bird's in the film. The passive-aggressiveness and hard love from Christine's mom was so believable that it often made me cringe. It was almost too real.As you watch the film unfold, you'll say to yourself ""I've seen this story before"" and you probably have. But there is still something different about Lady Bird with its hilariously written raunchy language, Lady Bird's amazing friend Julie, and the way in which it weaves in and out of Lady Bird's life and those surrounding her. There is a certain scene where Lady Bird's mother talks about her dad's battle with depression for years and Lady Bird telling her that no one ever informed her about it. Later in the film, Lady Bird's mom scolds her for not sharing more information with their family, proving the fact that there are moments in both the adult and children's world that do not always cross paths. Since Ronan is so strong in the lead role, we often forget that she is just a teenager that hasn't been through some of the really hard things in life just yet. She hasn't gotten too drunk, lost a job, kept a family and children happy, found or lost out on success, paid bills, been late on a credit card payment, had a really rough day at work, and so much more. Lady Bird's mom, however, has been. She may come off as scary to others, but in all fairness, her own mother was an abusive drunk, and she's been through a little more in life then many of these high school kids. It's not always as easy as some people make it out to be. I think we also see that Lady Bird can be a little intimidating as well with her confidence and free-spirit attitude roaming the halls of school and her home. She is kind and loving, yet up front and blunt. In my family, my brother is a spitting image of my dad in every way. They bash heads the most because my dad sees his own flaws in my brother, and I believe that's hard for any parent to accept. As we grow older, we find things about our parents we genuinely do not like as well, but we know they are just humans like the rest of us. They make mistakes, they have flaws and often, many of these flaws are passed down generation-to-generation. We also start to see our own flaws and I think Lady Bird absolutely nails this concepts and creates some genuinely funny, sad, and real-life scenes that hit home with the audience and make us fall in love with the characters. At one point in the film, Christine says that she just wants to live through something, and what she fails to realize, is that she is living through something. We all are. She's living through lots of things. It just never feels that way when you're the one living through it."
20,Lady Bird,3,14 December 2017,Sorry...,"I wish I could agree with the high-scoring reviews, but I cannot. This movie seemed flat, monotone, mildly entertaining. The lead was perfunctory...another disgruntled teen who desperately wants to get out of her home town and fly to the East Coast ""where there is culture"". New Hampshire and culture? Hmmm... 
Lady Bird clashes with her mom (Laurie Metcalf...who deserves 10 stars by herself). So, a teen clashes with her mom...wow...news flash. 
Dad loses his job...and seems to be just fine with that, even though they are running out of money. Weird. 
The supporting cast seems to be chosen to complete a requisite menu of characters: the overweight but beautiful-inside best friend, the gorgeous and wealthy but shallow new friend, the handsome but...surprise...gay boy. Somehow this lack of originality does not drive a strong story line.
The crash and burn ending is, well, the only twist in this story...so, back home she goes, and realizes she really does love Sacramento. Perhaps Sacramento is a metaphor for almost every town in America, but the story never hints at that. So, sorry, this one just did not resonate with me."
21,Lady Bird,9,29 December 2017,What a trip.,"Movies affect us in different ways.
I've met people who didn't like Lady Bird and people who loved it, I could come up with a thousand excuses as to why I gave this movie a 9/10 but the truth is, I relate to it on a very personal level.
In fact, I was certain some parts of this movie were taken straight from my life story. Going to a religious school, having a sister and a mother that are exactly like the characters on this movie, seeing their arguments, it all took me back, having a very caring and sweet father who does not like to admit when he's feeling sad, all of that. I don't remember the last time I was sad because a movie ended. 
Honestly this movie could have been 4 hours long and I would still watch it. I did not want it to end. I was sad and happy at the same time when it did. When a movie makes you feel like that, when a movie makes you feel for the characters, when a movie touches you like this movie did, that's a sign of great cinema. It all felt very nostalgic and all I'm left with is the wish to go back in time.
The actors are of course amazing, they feel very real and the dialogue just flows like water.
Having a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes or a 20%, I feel like I would love this movie no matter what, that's the beauty of it all. It doesn't matter if it sucks for everyone else, what matters is how you feel while watching it, so watch it. Give it a try, it might awaken some memories from your past."
22,Lady Bird,8,3 December 2017,An optimistic coming of age tale.,"""Lady Bird"" is a character piece focused on a California high school senior and her coming of age leading up to college. With strong influences from ""Rushmore,"" (seemingly) this comedic and memorable drama is a standout for actress Saoirse Ronan and director Greta Gerwig and as one of the best films of the year. The film's brilliant balance of genuine emotional drama and laugh-out-loud humor is astonishingly smooth. This is easily one of the year's best written films with strong structure throughout. Practically everything in the writing works to the quirky dialogue, realistic back and forth between characters, and our heroin's progression and change throughout the story. Most will find the screenplay refreshingly original minus a few jokes that don't land well with the characters themselves and therefore, the audience.This is also an incredibly well acted film with standout performances from Saoirse Ronan, Lucas Hedges, and especially Laurie Metcalf. The magic behind their performances it that it feels like it's not a performance at all. Diving into realistic and genuine human emotions bring out the most humanistic side to these characters and each one goes above and beyond what was required of them.If there are any negatives to dish out, the surprising lack of external conflict could've hurt the story slightly in my opinion. Being more of a character study, ""Lady Bird"" focuses on the heroin's journey internally but if more external conflict was available to possibly push her further to grow even more, this could've strengthened the already good payoff for the character's climax. Sacrificing these plot devices for realism is a bold move and does have its upsides, but in the case of ""Lady Bird,"" it felt like some unused potential.Really this is a highly recommended film with lots to love about it. It's witty, funny, and compelling to watch from start to finish. Anyone could find something to thoroughly enjoy in this film, whether they're film buffs or casual moviegoers looking for a fun time. ""Lady Bird"" fortunately, has both."
23,Lady Bird,6,17 November 2017,Flies and Nests into Your Heart for an Extended Stay,"We each have nicknames given to us by loved ones. My dad always called my sister ""boop"" (for reasons unknown), and he called me ""TFF"" for ""Trevor-fo-fevor;"" one friend of mine went by his middle name ""Xavier,"" and another calls his daughter ""goose."" Nicknames always become so personal because they say practically everything about the bond between the name's owner and the name's caller.So what could be told about a girl who gave herself the nickname Lady Bird? One, she has high self-dependency. Two, she seeks image confidence. Three, she feels too distanced from mom and dad to accept their nicknames. Indeed, you learn even more about Lady Bird as her graduation impends- class of 2003.Lady Bird just wants to fly away from dull old Sacramento for college on the East Coast; her disrespect upon the confused adults seems understandable enough, since 9/11 still dawdles fresh in the nation's memory. However, Lady Bird only knows Sacramento's restrictive side. Director/writer Greta Gerwig, along with the small production crew, pays off their united vision in a humble, down to earth fashion similar to an early 2000's comedy. Gerwig's often slow/often fast approach documents Lady Bird's problems under the awkward pressure of growing up into the unknown: awareness about weight gain, knowing who her real friends are, uncertainty about sexuality, plus more you survived in your youth.Lady Bird's oppressive school adds but an extra layer of confusion. The familiar details of a religious institution restrict every teen's need for self-discovery: dancers keep ten inches apart for the Holy Spirit, skirts below knee level, etc. Lady Bird expresses her attitude about the rules by the way she casually eats the communion wafers as if they were goldfish crackers.Yet the girl's shaky maternal bond most allows the coming of age story's real heart to bloom. Right away the two argue in the car about college, a disagreement she ends by opening the door to the pavement. Now a pink cast on her forearm, a profanity written on toward the one she accuses as responsible, explains their whole relationship. Contrary to Lady Bird's assumptions, mother truly loves her, as expressed through a clear balance between disciplined silence and a compassionate ear to keep Lady Bird's head on straight. You may even notice a subtle role reversal, proving Lady Bird's invisible likenesses to her family. So I wholeheartedly recommend Lady Bird for any mother-daughter night out.While the script's more personal than usual, it still comes off one- sided, mainly against Lady Bird's overly oppressive Catholic school experience. Both inside and outside the school, Lady Bird's rebellious actions, such as shoplifting, play either for cheap laughs or to cast a stark shadow over religion. Her two older adoptive siblings also contribute little plot importance besides forgettable reactions about her attitude. These two piercing studded emos of ethnic color should have been more down-to-earth voices of reason, ones different from the parents or teachers, but this opportunity is missed.Gerwig's approach predominantly passed the opportunity of true love for Sacramento as a location. Remember that song about West Virginia? A love letter about the state's old life: older than the trees and younger than the mountains? No comparable love for the city of Sacramento resolves Lady Bird's matters in a satisfying fashion by the end.An added complaint goes to the crew's decision to cast 23-year-old Saoirse Ronan to play a teenager, even though she looks too old to play someone underaged. A couple of the other actors halt the enjoyment, particularly Lucas Hedges' (Manchester by the Sea), clumsy performance as Lady Bird's little turtle-dove.Although many other strong performances keep the production's awards thirst hydrated, especially Oscar-bound Laurie Metcalf, who vigorously plays Mrs. Lady Bird. Stephen Henderson, the underrated thespian from Fences, satisfies as well as the school's cheerful old drama coach.So, if I had a nickname for Lady Bird, it would still embrace the initials LB, for ""Loving Believability,"" as you believe the low points and love the high points. Everyone itches at some desire to leave home, so we each could use a comforting soul like Lady Bird by our side."
24,Lady Bird,8,1 January 2018,The hardest relationship is the mother and teenage daughter one,"12/31/17. Maybe 3 1/2 stars. This is a gem of a movie that is worth catching! It really is about the mother and daughter relationship at the point when it is the hardest relationship to be in - those adolescent years. Ronan is at the edge of 17, awkward and unsure of herself, her feelings, her future, etc. One thing she is sure of - her mother may love her but doesn't like her. The nuanced difference is extremely important as Metcalf is extremely careful in parsing the semantics - love is not like, and she loves her very much. The McPhersons are a lower middle class family that struggles to makes ends meet. Mom is realistic about expectations, but Lady Bird is free of those expectations, and wants to take flight to a more cultured territory, New York. This movie is about coming of age for those who dream of a better life in a country that is not as classless as it is portrayed in the mainstream. We secretly wish Lady Bird will find her happiness."
25,Lady Bird,9,13 December 2017,Simple story line with instant connect,"A movie like Lady Bird falls in the same line as 'American Beauty' or other such films which depict the life of a common American. Here it is tracing the journey of a high schooler through her admission to college and everything in between; falling for singing band guys, first time sex, an overly protective mother, pressure of being judged, life at Catholic school ..to name a few.
The various aspects of the movie are depicted in an extremely natural way which would form an instant connect with the audience. Whether you are an adult who has faced similar issues in high school, or a father who cares for her daughter enough, one finds glimpses of everyday characters we encounter.
The movie starts erratically but finds semblance , pace and emotions guzzling towards the later half.
A must watch and kudos to Greta Gerwig and all actors in the movie for playing their part so well."
26,Lady Bird,8,10 January 2018,Realistic life & love story,"This beautiful movie shows us that some things that are supposed to be great do not always turn out to be great but exactly the opposite (first time, relationships, friendships). Greta Gerwig managed to show all of the natural elements of a young girl and her dreams and thoughts in simple, light, nice and comedic way. A drama/comedy masterpiece!"
27,Lady Bird,9,10 January 2018,A Realistic and Off-beat Depiction of Teenage Life,"It's easy to look at films like Lady Bird and think of it as being a pretentious piece of cinema, but there's so much explored under the surface here that makes almost every one of those arguments invalid. I may be slightly biased in terms of enjoying dramas like this, but I genuinely feel that many people will be able to relate to at least one aspect of this movie. This is the definition of an indie film making its way into the mainstream and I must warn that it's not going to be for everyone. Here's why I think you may just fall in love with this movie under the right circumstances.Following a young woman as she awkwardly makes her way through her senior year of high school, Lady Bird explores popularity, family issues, jealousy, and numerous other issues that teenagers face on a daily basis, so if you go into this film having already experienced those years of your life, I guarantee there will be a section of this movie that you can relate to. This is what makes movies like this worth watching, at least in my opinion. It's really just a slice of life about a woman who goes by the alias ""Lady Bird"" throughout the majority of the film. There are many off-beat sequences and characters throughout this film that may turn many viewers off, but I believe they're saved by a tremendously committed performance by Saoirse Ronan.Ronan's performances have always been highlights of every movie she chooses, and Lady Bird is no exception to that statement. Her interaction with her friends, family members, classmates, and teachers all felt incredibly realistic. There are moments where her lines of dialogue do feel scripted which took me out of a few moments, but her delivery is always incredible, so that makes up for the fact that you may feel like you're watching just any old indie film. Her performance makes this film soar, but I think the real star of the show is the editor.The way this film's put together almost felt like a master had been at work for years on a passion project. The editing choices and the overall flow of each and every scene are truly what hooked me on this film more than I thought I would've been. Quite honest, the editor of this film played his own role in this movie, making a possibly boring aspect of the story unique to watch. The use of certain songs being played over and over again also became its own character in the story. Although this may not make it on my list for best films of 2017, I can truthfully say that Lady Bird is one of the more technically impressive films, even if not for effects.In the end, Lady Bird didn't blow me away in terms of storytelling, but the way the film is put together impacted me greatly. That, along with terrific performances and a solid exploration of the psyche of teenagers, really had me applauding by the time the credits began to roll. Personally, I felt as though there were many aspects to love about this movie, but I can't see everyone having the same reaction as I did, especially average moviegoers who aren't used to out-of-the-box filmmaking.As far as the story goes, many independent films have tackles this premise throughout the years, but it's all about how your film is presented and how it emotionally impacts its viewers, and I feel as though Lady Bird does that beautifully. The re-watchability isn't very present here, but it's a nearly flawless one-time viewing experience. Highly recommended to film fans."
28,Lady Bird,2,27 November 2017,Totally Overrated,"I watched the trailer and saw that it received 100% on rottentomatoes.com so I figured it must be worth watching, but when I walked out of the theater I felt disgruntled and wanted my money and time back. The movie reminded me of 'Garden State' (2004) in that it was trying to be quirky, deep, and epic all at the same time, but was just another forgettable film. It really fell flat for me and the script/dialog was sometimes awkward and/or did not make sense. I'm surprised IMDb only listed one 'goof'. There were a couple of funny moments and the soundtrack wasn't bad -- those are the only nice things I can say about it."
29,Lady Bird,10,3 January 2018,YOuth is wasted on the young.,Ladybird was not what I expected. Yes it's a coming-of-age of a young lady and the conflicts with her dominate mother. But it's has a deeper sense of loss of innocence and how youth is wasted on the young. Often young people are in a hurry to grow up. When in reality we should live in the present and not worry about the future so much. Because in the end it all works out. Good acting and emotionally compelling story.
30,Lady Bird,8,4 December 2017,Small Town Girl Makes Good,"Having been a product of Sacramento I can speak with some authority on the vibe and allure the city/town offers. The casting was superb, the detail mindful and the dialog real. The fast pace of the film was a contrast and appreciated yet real time in Sacramento lags. Lady Bird and her mothers relationship is all too common during the teen years of angst and the coming of age battles one fights are displayed truthfully. Anyone with attachment to the city must see this film, you'll realize that sometimes the grass is not always greener and appreciate what you had when it's gone."
31,Lady Bird,8,27 November 2017,A great comedy and moving drama for 2017,"In one of the funniest films of the year, Greta Gerwig writes and directs about the travails of a teenage girl in Sacramento, California. Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) hopes to make her own path in life despite warnings from her mother Marion McPherson (Laurie Metcalf). With her father Larry McPherson (Tracy Letts) struggling to keep a job, the expenses of college weigh on Lady Bird. She would like to go to a college on the East coast far from Sacramento but her mother would prefer she stay close. The two of them do not always get along and their arguments escalate so far that Lady Bird throws herself out of the car in the first stunning scene of the film. With her arm in a cast, she attends the senior year of high school at a Catholic school because her adopted brother Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues) saw someone get stabbed in public school.Miguel went to Berkeley but has moved back into their parents' home with his wife Shelly (Marielle Scott) to bag groceries. Lady Bird doesn't always fit in at the school but she and her best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein) find happiness on the outskirts eating the holy wafers and gossiping about boys and masturbation. Lady Bird meets Danny (Lucas Hedges) while auditioning for a musical and they soon fall in love. She attends his family's Thanksgiving dinner upsetting her mother but seeing what life is like on the wealthier side of the train tracks. However, another boy Kyle (Timothée Chalamet) catches her eye and when Lady Bird stumbles onto Danny making out with another guy in the boys' bathroom, it ends their relationship quickly. Danny struggles to come out to his family and begs Lady Bird not to tell anyone. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
32,Lady Bird,8,11 November 2017,Gerwig and Ronan team up to present incisive portrait of West Coast Parochial school rebel,"I remembered Greta Gerwig from ""Frances Ha"" which I didn't really care for so I was more than surprised to discover that not only can she direct (as evidenced by her efforts here with Lady Bird) but is a talented screenwriter as well (yes, she also wrote the screenplay!). Her story is set in (of all places), Sacramento, and stars the consistently strong Irish-American actor Saoirse Ronan as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, an off-beat adolescent in her senior year at a local parochial school, hoping to get accepted by a good school on the east coast (as opposed to a state university which her parents can afford).Christine calls herself ""Lady Bird"" in order to stand out from her peers, and her mother Marion (played by Laurie Metcalf in a potential Oscar-winning performance) can't get used to the new appellation. The conflict between the two is the highlight of the film, as Christine's mother is hard on her daughter at almost every turn, wanting the best for her but insisting on good behavior. Christine, on the other hand, resents her mother's interference in her life and consequently struggles with her self-image. Gerwig's portrait of the wayward adolescent is spot-on, as Christine exhibits that perfect mixture of arrogance and wisdom, typical of gifted but confused teenagers.Gerwig is intent on eschewing the usual clichés of coming-of-age narratives. What impressed me the most was her sympathetic treatment of the parochial school priests and nuns, entrusted with educating kids who are not exactly what you would call devoted Catholics. You wouldn't expect a priest (Father Leviatch) to be conducting auditions for a Sondheim musical (in this case, ""Merrily we Roll Along"") but that's exactly what he does and later bemoans the unenthusiastic audience reaction, exclaiming that they ""just didn't ""get it""he's also the same priest who conducts a group therapy session exhorting the students to be the ""first one to cry"" (and of course, it's Father Leviatch who is the first to emote!).There's also another hilarious scene with the football coach (another priest!--Father Walther) who subs for Father Leviatch (who eventually resigns due to depression). The coach directs Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" as if it's a football game and the beleaguered drama students all must cope with the coach's crazy approach.When Christine is suspended after falling afoul of a teacher who promotes a pro-life stance (relating that her mother was considering an abortionand this particular teacher wouldn't have been born had her mother gone ahead with her initial decision), the Mother Superior, Sister Sarah Joan, confides to Christine that that the anti-abortion teacher is really a blow-hard and she actually found Christine's comments (that led to her suspension) to be amusing. Hence, Christine gets off lightly with Gerwig emphasizing the humanity of the nun in charge.There are multiple twists and turns in the plot that keep the story fresh throughout. When Christine discovers her first love, Danny, is gay, she stops speaking to him out of anger. But later she forgives and hugs him, after he reveals that he'll probably be rejected by his family if he comes out of the closet. Similarly, the theme of forgiveness is also played out in Christine's relationship to her best friend, Julie, with whom she has a falling out over her new relationship with Jenna, a ""bad girl"" to Julie the ""good."" After Christine falls for a second boy, Kyle, she again endures disappointment when she discovers that he's already slept with six other girls and is no ""virgin"" as he had told Christine earlier. This leads the emotionally devastated Christine to reconcile with Julie, and in another delightful twist, they end up dancing together at the Senior Prom!Last but not least, Christine's father, Larry (a low-key but highly effective Tracy Letts), despite having lost his job, provides emotional support for Christine along with helping her fill out financial aid applications. Much to her mother's chagrin, Christine is accepted by a college in NYC and her mother isn't talking to her as she jets off to her new life at the university.An overdose of alcohol (which lands her briefly in the hospital) perhaps is the trigger that helps her to grow up and realize that her mother loved her all along, and she is now ready to start her freshmen yearbin New York as a full-fledged adult!With the usual ubiquitous glut on the market of coming of age stories, Greta Gerwig manages to infuse her tale with a rich tapestry of intuitive observations of life, making her freshman effort an extraordinary winning one, deserving of all the accolades already heaped upon it."
33,Lady Bird,,31 December 2017,A charming film about real life,"This film tells the story of a high school girl who tries to find herself in the world, amongst her peers and the adolescent turbulence.""Lady Bird"" is a charming film about real life. The characters are believable, and in fact I can relate to multiple characters in the film. The story does not feel formulaic. There are no outrageous drama or overly cliched characters, but the story just keeps me interested in it. The ending is a nice resolution, wrapping up and referring back to various moments in the film. I like it."
34,Lady Bird,9,30 December 2017,COA at its best.,"When I saw the trailer for this film I knew upon seeing it i'd enjoy it, however I didn't anticipate just how much of an effect it would have on me and how relatable it was. I decided to watch it as a pick me up and have continued to rewatch it a bunch since. The dynamic between Ladybird and Marion is so genuine and I found the portrayal of the opinionated strong-willed mother and daughter butting heads paralleled my own life in a way I needed to see on-screen to fully understand. In that way the film taught me about myself and I'm sure many other viewer felt similarly - I think anyone watching will find something they relate to as there are many heartfelt subplots that tie into the main plot. I tend to like coming-of-age films even though many of them are cringey. For example, Lady bird is similar to The Edge of Seventeen (which I enjoyed without having many standards for it) except Lady Bird actually stands out for its character development and integrity, cinematography, and resolution. Although I've just seen it I'd had to say this is my favorite film of 2017 and one of my favorite films I've seen in a long time. It sticks with you and for me personally, it was exactly what I needed exactly when I needed it."
35,Lady Bird,8,28 December 2017,Lovely movie and great story telling,"A lovely movie i truly enjoyed all the way through. I love Gretha Gerwigs directing in this film, and the story telling is amazing. You truly feel that the movie has a story to tell, more than just a teen tired of her boring life and parents. A great and enjoyable coming of age movie.
The directing reminded me a bit of the same style as Woody Allen type movie which only made me enjoy the movie even more. I am excited to see what the future brings for Greta Gerwig!
Saoirse Ronan is yet again brilliant. Her performances are always so captivating and keeps you entertaint all the way through. Truly an Oscar worthy performance."
36,Lady Bird,10,26 December 2017,Life Happened,"We're introduced to a mother and her daughter, both loving, laughing and enjoying each others company then suddenly turns into an argument, full of stubbornness and Why-can't-you-accept-this sort of situation, and the daughter (Christine ""Lady Bird"") jumps out of the car while it's still moving in full speed. Watching this was like taking a trip down memory lane, nostalgic music, looks, atmosphere etc. I can't really put a finger on what it is I like so much about it. I just felt the whole film was so relatable, and it was almost like it was a film about my life by not really at the same time. It's about seeking the identity, finding out who you are, exploring and finding your own way. I guess this was why I liked it so much, I could really relate to the character of Christine ""Lady Bird"", her doing everything to both stand out and fit in at the same time, learning everything the hard way. And I just loved the scene when she turns 18 and goes to the store to get a pack of camel cigarettes and a play girl magazine, waiting for the guy working the cashier to ask for her ID. Been there done that. And another scene where she pass her driving test and thanking the instructor or water you call that guy. Hilarious and yet again relatable. Actually everything in this film was relatable.
Writing this review made me realise that what they captured so good in this move was LIFE, all the up and downs, and with that found I'm ending this because that's what the film really is about LIFE and why it was so damn good!"
37,Lady Bird,10,23 November 2017,"One of the best coming-of-age films, and one of the best of the year!","I really enjoyed LADY BIRD. One of the *best* films of the year! I totally related to the story especially the protagonist relationship with her mother and friends, and the dream of moving away to college! I watched LADY BIRD in a packed theatre with people of all ages which was fantastic to see because I've rarely seen a packed theatre for an 'independent' film! There were laughter and tears throughout. I think Gerwig has made a film for the ages. Her script is really strong and her direction too. The acting is remarkable especially Saoirse Ronan (never puts a foot wrong) and Laurie Metcalf who plays the mother so darn well! The supporting call are really great too-Beanie Feldstein, Tracy Letts, Lucas Hedges & Timothee Chalamet. This film *deserves* lots of awards love for sure! 10/10"
38,Lady Bird,8,3 November 2017,"A Hilarious, Poignant Coming-of-Age Comedy","Greta Gerwig's directorial debut is a very funny and entertaining film about a rebellious young woman who is a senior at a Catholic high school in Sacramento. She wants to attend college on the East Coast, preferably in New York City. I have always been a fan of Gerwig and her work, and I can say that her filmmaking skills are incredibly strong here as far as directorial debuts go. The screenplay is full of wit and emotion. While the film is very light in tone, the characterizations present through the narrative as well as the film's juxtaposition of its main events pertaining to Lady Bird's (the nickname of the protagonist) final year in high school give the script considerable weight and power.Saorise Ronan gives a hearty and very authentic performance in the lead role, and the supporting cast is generally very strong. The film's tone feels playful but also enjoyably sassy and thoughtful. As a result, the film feels far more potent than just about anything in the teenage/coming-of-age genre. While the film's pacing in its final scene feels slightly awkward given its contrast of pace with the rest of the narrative, the film feels fully satisfying in its entirety despite running a lean 93 minutes. Additionally, some of the plot devices that help form the narrative and plot line of the film feel rather predictable. However, that ends up being only a minor complaint because the humor, heart and bite of the writing helps drown out any sense of clichés that a viewer might feel. Overall, I thought this was a great and very funny coming-of-age comedy that I had a lot of fun watching. I look forward to seeing what Greta Gerwig does next with her undeniable talent. Definitely recommended. 8.5/10"
39,Lady Bird,8,3 November 2017,Lady Bird (2017),"This film received very high praise from early screenings and it wasn't hard to see why. Saoirse Ronan is a star, absolutely blowing everyone away in Brooklyn. Then you have Greta Gerwig, a force in a few Noah Baumbach films, with a highly anticipated directional debut. Was incredibly hyped for this one all the way through. It feels short because the film just flies by but its rather excellent. Very satisfied with the turnout for this one.The film is about Christine McPherson (Ronan) who has given herself the name ""Lady Bird"". She is a high school senior in a Catholic school who struggles through what a typical girl of that age goes through. She faces the trials and tribulations of dating boys, losing her virginity, trying to be popular, feuding with her best friend and mother, and ultimately trying to figure out what to do with her life. Things are tough for her and she examines her relationships with friends and family to ultimately come to the best decision for herself.The film sounds like a typical film plot. In many ways it is. Yet everything about the film is done so well in the expert hands of novice filmmaker Greta Gerwig. The dialogue is sharp, hilarious, and witty. The character development, interaction, and acting are all strong. Saoirse Ronan is at the very least sealing an Oscar nomination for best actress and might even go on to win it. It seemed like such an effortless performance for a girl who completely disappears into the character idiosyncrasies of Lady Bird. Its a wonderful coming of age film that hits all the check marks and does so very effectively.I can't think of any complaints. The film feels so real and identifiable. Its exactly what you want and is a very impressive debut from Gerwig. The film has a nice touch at the end and does what it needs to do to remain funny and touching. I don't mind a good coming of age comedy every year (Edge of Seventeen taking the cake last year). I expect this to be an award contender for at the very least Ronan's performance and Gerwigs writing and directing.8/10"
40,Lady Bird,,15 November 2017,One of the best ever coming-of-age comedies.,"""I wish I could live through something."" Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan)Nothing in the constantly funny and stunning coming-of-age film Lady Bird will surprise any audience. It's all been played before: conflict with mom, loving dad, high-school romances, gawky and hip girl friends, amateurish school play, agony about college admission, and nuns who restrain and nuns who nurture.She has indeed lived through ""something"" up to her waning adolescence, but as in the case of her hometown, Sacramento, she has to look back at it to see that she has lived there fully and uniquely. Right now, before graduation, the city is to her ""the Midwest of California."" The real difference from other growing-up stories is first-time solo writer/director Greta Gerwig and Saoirse Ronan (who plays Christine ""Lady Bird ""McPherson). Together they craft a lovable, flawed heroine with such a sense of herself and her future that she is unafraid to taste life in its entirety, blessed or broken. Forget Julia Stiles in 10 things I Hate About You. Bird is better.As in most films where a young girl is taught in a Catholic high school, the nuns are the looming moral force for restraint and also dream, embodied in the principal, Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), a realist who knows Lady Bird is a creative and independent spirit. So, too, in a different way is Lady Bird's mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf), whose tough love is constant, but whose love is there if only Lady Bird would see it. Mom's agony at the airport when Bird goes to college is as anguished a mom/daughter parting as you will ever see in a comedy.Moments of humor are plentiful and low key, e.g., when Sister Sarah's reality check with Lady Bird, ""Math is not your strength,"" is met with Bird's ""that we know of, yet."" While Mom's realism is minute by minute, Sister Joan gives hers out slowly with equal portions of quiet love.While actress Ronan has already tasted life from an adolescent heroine, Hannah, to a young adult in Brooklyn, Lady Bird could be seen as a retro acting gig. Bird is so strongly mature yet naïve that this role defines Ronan's wide-ranging ability. So, too, great Greta, a directorial/writing genius who should outstrip Woody Allen by the time he fully matures."
41,Lady Bird,8,10 November 2017,A Prequel to Frances Ha,"Lady Bird is the semi-biographical directing debut of noted indie actress Greta Gerwig. The film stars Saoirse Ronan as Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson, a Sacramento teen whose uneasy shift into adulthood bears unpredictable and transformative results for her, her friends and her family. She dreams of moving as far away as possible for college, in part to avoid her contentious relationship with her mother (Metcalf). The prospect seems unlikely however given her father's recent unemployment. Thus while she waits, Lady Bird soaks in and learns from her encounters with her boyfriends, her run-ins with the well-meaning nuns at her out-of-touch Catholic School and the quirks of her dozy hometown.Much like Gerwig's breakthrough success Frances Ha (2012) (a film she also co-wrote), Lady Bird has a very frank, very refreshing honesty to it. The characters, both major and minor are flawed and sympathetic, the story and the city in which it takes place feels fleshed out; drawn with an appreciation and love that appeals to a certain sense of remembrance. It's not nostalgic  who truly can be nostalgic for 2002, a year Lady Bird notes for being a palindrome and little else. It's more like an honest examination of that awkward period in life after high school, before college where boredom, jadedness and sexual frustration can unknowingly turn you into the adult you will become.The honesty goes a long way in overcoming the usual teen dramedy clichés. While the film stops just short of surprising audiences with the wholly unexpected, Lady Bird nevertheless spins its web of story lines in a unique configuration. The expected mother-daughter friction, the Catholic School repression and the pompous proto-douche boyfriend subplots are all here and accounted for but they're painted in with such care and loving detail. Like a Faberge egg this film is cognizant of tradition but encrusted with unique filigree all its own.Supporting cast members Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts are truly spectacular as Lady Bird's hardened but still loving parents. They both dominate different extremes of the parental spectrum (one overbearing, the other a little too free-wielding), yet both only want what's best for their children even if it costs them their pride, their finances and in one subplot their dignity. Beanie Feldstein and Lucas Hedges likewise make pretty good hay out their roles as Lady Bird's long suffering best friend and first boyfriend respectively. While it would have been nice to see more of Hedges exploring the deeper complexities of his character, what ends up on screen, works in serving the overall narrative.Saoirse Ronan isan interesting choice as an avatar for Gerwig's personal tale of adolescence and turmoil. The film requires her to be funny, charming, excitable, aggressive, and a bit of a brat depending on the circumstances. And while the young actress hits all those notes, she does so with an uncomfortable passivity that often risks making the movie about her environment as opposed to about her. One can't help but compare Ronan to the fearless Hailee Steinfeld of last year's Edge of Seventeen (2016) and wonder if by this time next year, we'll still be talking about the self-absorbed but not too self-absorbed Lady Bird? That along with the strong inference that Lady Bird is a lesser, spiritual prequel to Frances Ha means the film, for all its positives doesn't go all-the-way sort of speak. It's an honest movie and a lovely movie but not as truly transformative or life-changing as could have or should have been. The bad news is that means The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) will stay in the popular consciousness for only that much longer. The good news is hopefully that means Greta Gerwig is just getting warmed up. With a movie that ultimately feels as custom made as this one, I'm very, very excited to see what she comes up with next."
42,Lady Bird,10,3 January 2018,Excellent Coming of Age Story,"I found this film to be incredibly relatable and touching.
The entire cast was superb, specifically Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalfe, who I hope to see take home oscars!
Definitely would recommend this, especially for film-lovers."
43,Lady Bird,10,10 January 2018,"For a story about a teenager discovering that perspective is different from dreams, Lady Bird hits all the right notes.","Teenagers today may think their more advanced then teens of the past, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. True, technology has made the world smaller for them and they have a greater access of content, but as soon as they enter high school, a lot of those kids cannot fathom a world where despite talking about serious issues, they are still treated like children. They wouldn't believe it, but that's been the American teenage lifestyle for a long time. They want to be seen for their individuality and their enthusiasm to try and make a difference. They definitely deserve to be heard, but perspective is something that cannot gain until they experience it.Kids need to trial the complications of school, work, relationships, sex, and even of their own hobbies. What separates newer kids today is that because of social media and an overuse of the Internet, many assume that just seeing more of that can substitute for the real thing. No matter what background they come from, they'll see the troubles of all those things once they actually encounter them. For one teenage girl, she experiences all of that and them some in Lady Bird. Christine ""Lady Bird"" (played by Saoirse Ronan) is just starting her last year in a Catholic high school where her hope is to get away from Sacramento and move to New York. She see's it as an escape from her tough willed mother Marion (played by Laurie Metcalf), her more understanding, but depressed father Larry (played by Tracy Letts), and from a place where she feels is nowhere. She talks about those dreams with her closest friend Julianne (played by Beanie Feldstien). Lady Bird is then told that if she wants a chance to get into any out of state schools, she'll have to participate in extra curricular activities to make up for her okay grades.She joins theater. At first this seems successful, with her performing in the fall play, and even gaining a boyfriend Danny (played by Lucas Hedges). When things go wrong, she continues to look for ways to fit in with the popular ""cool"" crowd, which includes rich girl Jenna, and another boyfriend, the rocker emo Kyle (played by Timothee Chalamat). She also continues to battle her mother while keeping it secret that most of the schools she applied to were out of state. On the surface, Lady Bird seems to hit a lot of tropes that many teen films have already covered. The angst teenager, wanting to be popular, getting the boy of her, dreams, you know the drill. What separates it is how the script (written and directed by Greta Gerwig) plays out many of these moments. First, many scenes are presented in mid conversation. This oddly not only feels a bit more like how adult come into teenage monologues, but this gives us more of a chance to fill in the gaps to see how much the characters know. Second, none of the things ""Lady Bird"" is trying to do isn't an overall goal, but presented as things that could help.The main relationship that is the focus is on ""Lady Bird"" and her mother. I have to give this a lot of credit given how a lot of stories tend to shoe teenage girls having the rough relationship with their father, but people tend to forget that mothers can be just as hard on girls. This is why both Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf are perfect for their characters. Their both flawed people, and seeing how things play out for them is interesting. They can both say really mean things and good things, yet it never goes too far, cause they know they need each other for their purposes.I've praised her before, but Saoirse Ronan is a phenomenal actress who isn't just a nice face, but has the skill to make herself awkward enough for her to appear normal. It's easy to notice that she has an acne-ridden face (I want to know how she was convinced to go with that), which is also something film rarely portrays. I think there is a fear that pimples or any imperfections on a woman are sinful. Not all girls will have faces and bodies of goddesses. I give Greta Gerwig credit wanting to portray teenagers in an unappealing way; harsh, yet often the case anyway for insecure people.I'll give this ten graded math quizzes out of ten. Lady Bird may sound run of the mill, but I promise that the movie does feel a lot different from other teenage movies (I still consider Mean Girls and The Perks of Being a Wallflower the best). Teenage life isn't easy, but this movie shows how they won't see the truth until the witness the perspective. Check it out, and see if you'll grow up too."
44,Lady Bird,8,9 January 2018,I love it,"The movie is very good,i highly recommend.It is very funny at times and i laughed out loud.I also loved the performance of Saoirse Ronan,her acting was on point,one of my favorite actresses!Anyway do watch this movie it is very good."
45,Lady Bird,10,8 January 2018,"If you're trying to decide what to watch, go see this one","I knew about Lady Bird for a long time, but no more than the name. Yesterday I heard it was directed by Greta Gerwig and just ran to watch it. Because Greta never disappoints (and it's not that I'm biased, she just does a very great job writing and acting). Everything she does feels so real and relatable.
Many movies capture period of teen angst, trying to be important and to fit in. Rarely we see those teens grow up and go forth. 
I don't really want to talk about everything - cast is amazing, music is amazing, photography is beautiful, you get the 2000's vibe and pretty much feel how it was. Again, so many things you can relate to. I just don't feel like I have much to say besides praising everything. 
It's a remarkable movie, and I think at some point everyone should watch it. Just to feel touched and not alone. And to remind oneself how much they love their family and all those little detailes of their life. 
Thanks to everyone who worked on it!"
46,Lady Bird,8,3 January 2018,Saoirse Rules,"Saoirse Ronan stars as a 17 year-old student at a Catholic high school who dreams of getting away from Sacramento and making her way to New York and a college far away from a domineering mother. Mom is well played by veteran character actress Laurie Metcalf. The usual mother-daughter fights ensue, leading to a tear jerker ending. In between, we experience the common place teen angst in the form of first loves and first kisses. Ronan is great, although she was better in Brooklyn a couple of years ago. I am still livid over the Oscar's mistake of not awarding her best actress for that film. I have added this movie to my best ten list for 2017."
47,Lady Bird,10,3 January 2018,Real life,"I loved this film for so many reasons - mostly because it is real life. Mother/daughter conflicts and love, high school senior decisions about college and wanting out of the town you grew up in, falling in and out of love, best friend issues. father daughter love and support.
Lady Bird - played by Saoirse Ronan is so believable. Laurie Metcalf as the concerned and caring mom is real. Tracy Letts plays the loving father who is facing his own problems. Love this cast.
Many may consider this a low key and slow film - to me it is just right.
Kudos to Greta Gerwig for writing this and directing it with such care."
48,Lady Bird,8,30 December 2017,excellent moves,"This was a surprise,of a film that i will characterise as ''a girls movie''-with lots of family issues,friendbattles,strange love relationships,religion,virginity,sex,humour,warmth,and most of all a well deserved happy ending.
it is also a film about school and education,economics of scolarships etc. not being too familiar to u.s education system,i can surtainly understand that choice and abilities are as important as breathing for the average american youth.
the one who runs this flagship of a film,ms ronan,which i saw in the film''brooklyn'',makes a smashing performance.. there were at least 4 occations that took me so by surprise that i nearly started crying,of her grief,and happiness,and great immersion. she reminds me a bit of kate winslet,with a very clear sounded voice and dictation,important for a tinitusius viewer.
i can understand that some might find the pace in the movie a bit slow,but that was washed away by the connection it made to my own youth experiences.directors choice of locations are excellent,and very nice editing and musical score."
49,Lady Bird,,26 December 2017,Greta Gerwig is a minimalist,"Greta Gerwig is the biggest winner of ""Lady Bird"", proving herself to be one of the most promising young directors. What I like her most is that she is a minimalist, in the sense that she uses the most economical way to express the maximum information. Take one scene in the film for example. When Christine (Saoirse Ronan) receives the notification letters from the universities, only key information ""regret"", ""unable"" and ""wait list"" is shown to the audience. Also, when the audience see the ""...mbia University"", they know it's Columbia University.Lucas Hedges proves again that he is the best actor of his generation, following his breakthrough performances in ""Manchester by the Sea"". Laurie Metcalf also shines through the movie by showing a clear transition in the mother character she plays. The music score and soundtrack are pleasant and enjoyable."
50,Lady Bird,9,3 December 2017,Plenty of Spirit,"Christine, or Lady Bird, whichever names suits her is a strong and lively character, ready to express thoughts and opinions; yet there's still some innocence left in her, with much to learn along the way. She has been raised with enough freedom to express her opinions and to have some dreams, which might or not might come true, depending on the family situation. What's apparent is that Lady Bird could easily get lost, but she has a mother who is the family's rock, though her manners could antagonize everyone from the start. What's important is that she loves her family, and she does it fiercely.We accompany Christine through her senior year, as she lives through those special moments. She starts asserting herself, making difficult choices, trading friends, showing her independence, and going through the growing pains of her first love. For a few moments, I was afraid that we would go the expected path, but ""Lady Bird"" goes deeper in the character study of the family, and we get a sense of intimacy that lets you in, to become part of the story, a close observer, feeling the lows and highs.""Lady Bird"" is memorable because of the fine cast portraying all the members of the family. They're in first light, as average as they can be, but once we are done with the film, we realize that there's nothing average about them. Each contributes his/her own special experiences, shaping each other's lives, and allowing them to be an influence in theirs."
51,Lady Bird,9,30 November 2017,17-yea-old Sacramento girl matures,"The first shot packs the story. Mother and daughter sleep together in matching profiles. The serenity of the shot catches their essential bond, which their respective prickliness does its best to fray in their waking hours.Lying there, they look alike. As the father later explains, both women have such strong personalities that their clashing is natural  but their underlying love remains. Both women move through trying times with men. Mother Marion is a hospital counsellor who has to guide a grief-stricken priest. He was apparently not saved by directing his school production of Merrily We Roll Along. His ""They didn't get it"" suggests the rollicking audience missed the depressing undercurrents to which he was attuned. His successor is made of sterner stuff: directing The Tempest with the blackboard strategies of his football coaching.At home Marion has to deal with husband Larry's long battle with depression and his loss of his job. This while dealing with emotional teen Christine and adopted older son Miguel with his live-in girlfriend. The latter explicitly confirms our sense of Marion's ""big heart.""Christine grows through three beaus. The first turns out gay, the second an insensitive pretentious creep and her third  entering NYC  with their first kiss provokes her drunken puke. In consoling her gay guy she shows her mother's heart. She also briefly abandons her closest girl friend in vain hope of befriending the class's wealthy, snobbish beauty. As Christine grows through her tribulations Marion survives them.The film closes on two notes of reconciliation. On the long distance phone Christine tells her mother ""Thanks"" and ""I love you."" That's realizing the tacit harmony we saw in the first shot. Their unity is also the point of intercutting shots of mother and daughter driving through Sacramento. Equally important, Christine accepts herself  finally going by her given name Christine instead of yet again insisting on the ""Lady Bird"" with which has all along tried to romanticize herself."
52,Lady Bird,10,29 November 2017,Excellent solo debut from Greta Gerwig,"Thoroughly enjoyed LADY BIRD. Likely one of the best films of the year so far for me. With LADY BIRD, Gerwig has managed to bring a *fresh* approach on the coming-of-age genre filled with believable characters. I was basically watching my youth on the big screen. Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf both give Awards worthy performances backed-up by a fantastic supporting cast. The scenes are fast-paced so you don't feel like the story is dragging. I look forward to seeing what Gerwig does next! 10/10"
53,Lady Bird,9,28 November 2017,"Love of Place, Love of Experience","Lady Bird is an excellent coming of age story. It's full of love, realistic, yet vibrant characters, and attention to detail that makes every scene colorful. Greta Gerwig's film goes by at a rapid pace. The editing is stylish; scenes jump from a moment's climax to the middle of the fallout in the next, giving the audience more than enough to understand the weight of the situation while not bogging down the movie with rehashed platitudes present in the genre. The dialogue is witty and funny without being too cheesy, realistic without edging on dull. These are characters that feel familiar, but never become caricatures. Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Matcalf are simply outstanding in their roles as daughter and mother. While the writing is top-notch, the performances are equally astute.Lady Bird doesn't hit on a singular theme, or build up to a specific moment, but it's like a collection of vignettes in the life of our main character. Many situations are ones we've come to expect in a film like this: the first boyfriend/love, applying to and getting accepted into college, losing one's virginity, senior prom. None of these singular moments gets as much plot time in Lady Bird as they might in other high school films, but we feel the weight of how they affect the main character all the same. Much of Lady Bird's beauty is presented without the need to be explained or put into words. Discovering the love of a place, of family, of experiences, are human themes that, when done well, will never get old. A small montage of mother and daughter enjoying a day visiting various open houses packs an emotional punch that can only be felt in the context of their relationship and situation. Marion (Metcalf) breaking down in the car after dropping Christine (Ronan) off at the airport is so simple, yet one of the most powerful performances of the year. It happens organically, and is deserved because of how much tenderness and care is put into the character development up until that point. Lady Bird tells an honest story about different forms of love. It's one of the better movies of 2017."
54,Lady Bird,9,26 November 2017,I Liked It!,"Saoirse Ronan stars as Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson, she want's to escape from her home existence, and move somewhere where she can be free.Laurie Metcalf stars as 'Lady Bird' mother Marion McPherson, she wants her daughter to understand the reality of existence, but her struggle to understand her daughter usually ends with the two of them butting heads.I loved the relationship between Marion and 'Lady Bird', their scenes were the life and soul of the movie.The father (Larry McPherson) played by Tracy Letts was good, but there isn't much going on with him.The brother (Jordan Rodrigues) played Miguel McPherson, his scenes with 'Lady Bird' were funny, but he didn't have much to do as an overall character. Beanie Feldstein stars as 'Lady Bird' best friend Julie, all of her scenes with 'Lady Bird' were good, their friendship goes through the motions, and it's pretty entertaining.The various boyfriends of 'Lady Bird' come in and out, but that's usually how it is in high school, friends come and go.Overall, I enjoyed the movie Lady Bird. The relationship between Lady Bird and her mother was all great, the comedic stuff with Lady Bird and her brother was funny, the friendships and boyfriends that came and went did hold my interest, and I had fun and enjoyed the journey of Lady Bird.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLaxCE6Tr_8"
55,Lady Bird,9,25 November 2017,VIEWS ON FILM review of Lady Bird,"Lady Bird is my latest write-up. As you might have already discovered, it has nothing to do with the 36th President's late wife. So yeah, ""Bird's"" ending left my mind up in the air as well as on the edge of something. Still, this is a near-perfect film. It's definitely one of 2017's best.Lady Bird gives people like writer Diablo Cody and director Kelly Fremon Craig a run for their money. It has the blueprint of a familiar teen drama but so what. ""Bird"" shoots from the hip and dives much deeper than stuff like Juno and The Edge of Seventeen.Every sequence in ""Bird"" feels raw, unflinching, and just plain genuine. Every actor nuance is blessed with unassuming clout. With whip-smart dialogue, grainy locales, and keen direction by actor turned director Greta Gerwig, Lady Bird puts coming-of-age candor through the almighty ringer. All the characters (including the lead) are fully realized and no one harks a false note. Did I mention that Sacramento, California is this flick's unheralded star? It's true. So true.""Bird's"" story involves one Christine McPherson (played by Saoirse Ronan). Christine is a high school senior. She insists on being called ""Lady Bird"" and the pic never quite tells us why. She lives in Sacramento but wants to get out. Being from a lower-class family and having a love- hate relationship with her overbearing mother (Marion McPherson played by Laurie Metcalf), Christine dreams of attending college in New York. That way she'll make a ton of money and eventually thumb her mom's nose in it (in an unconditional, loving way of course).In retrospect, I'm hoping that Ronan and Metcalf get well-deserved nominations at the Academy Awards (for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively). Also, I'm rooting for Gerwig's truth to life screenplay to get some recognition as well.Overall, Lady Bird has the makings of a tender, persona study. It also contains a seething, coffee shop soundtrack and unfeigned acting of the highest order. With this film, the ""bird"" is undoubtedly the word! Rating: 3 and a half stars."
56,Lady Bird,8,23 November 2017,Teenage Angst and the Mother-Daughter Relationship,"I went into Lady Bird fully expecting to dislike the character of Lady Bird. From the trailers, she seemed like a self centered ungrateful brat. To some extent that holds true, it takes the self- named ""Lady Bird"" a while to consider the needs or feelings of others, but she experiences tremendous development over the course of the film. She really is an ordinary teenager, a confused girl who is simultaneously self-obsessed and tremendously empathetic.Saoirse Ronan brings a ton to the role of Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, a teenager trying to find her way in the world. She hates and loves her mother, brilliantly played by Laurie Metcalf, but she struggles to cope with those two conflicting feelings.Laurie Metcalf really elevates the role of Lady Bird's mother, she is perfectly described by one character as warm, but scary. She loves Lady Bird, but she doesn't really like her because she sees how much more she could be if she is able to get her head on straight. Metcalf should win an Oscar for this role as she is really what makes the whole thing work. The core of the entire film is the relationship between Lady Bird and her mother, and Ronan and Metcalf are perfect in how they play off each other here."
57,Lady Bird,10,23 November 2017,Good old fashion coming of age.,"On this planet, specifically within the borders of the United States, countless people dream of lives that just aren't obtainable, or at the very least harder to obtain than said people perceive. In Lady Bird, the writing and directing debut for Greta Gerwig, a go to for Noah Baumbach, Christine McPherson dreams of a life in New York... where the culture is. She is constantly reminded that she would never be able to go because she is a bad student, and on top of it, out of state tuition cost ""a lot of money"". Christine, self labeled ""Lady Bird"", is constantly at odds with her mother, her brother, and most others around her. During a scene in which a woman is presenting a lecture on abortion, she says something so disrespectful, that she ends up suspended. This movie isn't that kind of coming of age story though... not like Thirteen or Edge of Seventeen. This is a story about mothers and daughters and hometown pride. The screenplay is subtle and exhibits small quiet scenes of discourse that never once cross over the derivative threshold of melodrama. Gerwig, basing this loosely on her life manages to provide a vision of pure art while maintaining the qualities that make high school movies popular and entertaining in the first place. This movie is about the relationship between two women, one growing up, the other already grown. It is always about the mother accepting the individuality of the daughter, and the daughter accepting that her mother is not out to get her. The story manages this central narrative idea while balancing the young love life of Christine, presenting her with two relationships that change who she is, shaping her during the course of the movie. The story balances these two male counterparts perfectly, thanks once again to Gerwig's directing and Chamelet and Hedge doing fine work. All in all, this is a great film, that must experience by any mother and daughter in a trying relationship."
58,Lady Bird,,22 November 2017,"Charming, entertaining, and incredibly well written and acted","It's hard to know what to say about Lady Bird. Currently it sits at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes with about 150 reviews, which is a testament to how truly likable the film is. It would be hard to see many people disliking this, if any. Despite its acclaim, it's a relatively simple coming-of-age film. We've seen many like this, and while there are many good, even great ones, Lady Bird is one that truly captures the difficulty of growing up and the gratitude that sometimes escapes us about the sacrifices others have made for us. It's simple, but a film with a lot on its mind, and it translates to the screen incredibly well. Both Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf deliver some truly powerful, genuine, authentic work, and I really hope both are able to get Oscar nominations for their work here."
59,Lady Bird,9,3 December 2017,Simple But Incredibly Effective,"Does this movie follow the same formula that every other coming-of- age film follows? Yes, it does. But what makes Lady Bird so special is the performances across-the-board, and the writing and direction by Greta Gerwig. Saoirse Ronan is a force to be reckoned with. She is only 23 years old, and is already a two-time Academy Award nominee. And I do think there is a strong chance that she'll gain a third nomination for her role in this film. Ronan brings such humanity and energy to this character. She's quirky and out there, but not just for the sake of being so. It works for the character, and Ronan plays it so well. I guarantee you; she is an actor who will be around for a very long time, and this movie reaffirms that for me. Laurie Metcalf is also fantastic as the mother. She has a great dynamic with Lady Bird that gives the movie so much of its conflict, as well as its heart..."
60,Lady Bird,8,16 November 2017,A beautiful Youth,"Ladybird is a movie directed by Greta Gerwig. It is a comedy about a young girl played Saoirse Ronan who moved to Sacramento with her family to live a new life. However she is struggling to adapt to strict Catholic school she is in and her family's financial difficulties. She is trying to establish healthy relationship with people around her, especially her mother. This is the first film that I have seen in a long time, where I didn't see a single trailer or a poster other than knowing Saoirse Ronan is in the film and apparently the film was very good. That's why in the plot summary I didn't say much because to say anything more would be to describe every single little details happened in the film. I always loved Saoirse Ronan and I think she is a very talented young actress with great potential. She was in Hanna, one of the most underrated actions in the decade and I loved her performance in Brooklyn and Grand Budapest Hotel. After the failure of the Host, she went to back indie root and played in more arty film. This is a pleasantly surprising good movie. When the film starts, you have the impression that it is a coming of age story, which it is, but as the film went on it goes deeper and even darker. It dealt with subjects like anxiety, depression and even sexual identification. However doesn't play off in a serious tone, after all it is a comedy, it felt normal and lighthearted. And that is something missing in our mainstream movies. We don't see a lot of movies that felt like we are watching something as if it was unfold to us in real life. It is mostly thanks to the amazing acting the cast offers. I would say this is the best performance Saoirse Ronan has to offer. Also the mother played by Laurie Metcalf was very good and even though she constantly conflicting with her daughter, you understand why she is frustrated and you can tell that deep inside she loves her more than anything else. And that is the biggest strength of the film: because it felt so real and lighthearted, you felt every emotion the characters felt; joy, anger and pain. You understand how and why everyone do the things they do. I am surprised how dark some of the subject matters got, well at least for me personally. Last but not least, I have to mention the clever editing used in the film and its beautiful cinematography. I don't have too much complaint with the film, but there are a few nick picks. One of them was the pacing. The film is only 1 hr 33 mins long. There some scenes felt a bit rushed. I wish the film could slow down at times. The biggest flaw in the film I felt is with the ending. I won't spoil it but I felt it could be executed better and I thought it dragged a bit. What is more, some of the characters arcs are not resolved, but it doesn't bother me that much. Lady Bird is a very surprisingly good movie. I had a great time with it and made me feel hopeful. It is one of the best coming of age comedy I have seen. Even with its minor flaws I would highly recommend it to people. And if you are a teenage experiencing hardship, go watch it, it will make you feel better. 8.5/10"
61,Lady Bird,9,10 November 2017,'Lady Bird' Spreads Her Wings,"Portraying a likable rebel is a hard thing to do on screen. You would have to set up why they are the way they are, and still be able to give them fleeting moments of empathy or just go all the way with no regrets. Lady Bird takes a stab at finding the balance from first time director Greta Gerwig in a relatively conservative scenery but does a lot to make her stand out in this hilarious coming of age story.Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan) is Catherine McPherson's given alias when she becomes bored living her familiar life while in a Catholic High School in Sacramento. Her new persona makes her become more wandering and naturally gravitating to many different things around her like boys, new female friends and the dream of finding more like herself in a east coast college away from home.Saoirse Ronan does a great job as a rebellious yet empathetic teenager as her angst does feel like it comes from a genuine place. What I've always had issues in the past from coming of age films is they make the teenagers problems feel self inflicted, but instead her character is coming more from a place of needing to explore more in life. The director also gives a lot of great snappy dialogue with all the characters and having some truly hilarious moments (there's a scene where the kids are slow dancing to Bone Thugs n Harmony's The Crossroads that has me screaming).As for faults, there aren't too many, but are more so nitpicks within this films wings. While the film has a great first and third act, the second act has a couple of dragging moments. It's not often or super noticeable, but some of the films strongest points are around the outer shell.Lady Bird doesn't reinvent the wheel of coming of age stories, however it does move with a lot of charm. Saoirse is great in he lead role, a really strong script and has you on a ride with a character learning from their mistakes and understanding how their actions affect others. Rating: 9.3 / 10"
62,Lady Bird,8,12 December 2017,growing up here to go away,"Lady Bird directed by Greta Gerwig ( liked her in Maggie's plan) is a simple story about a simple senior high school girl Christine known as 'Lady Bird' ( played very well by Saoirse Ronan ) who wants to get out of Sacramento and live somewhere on east coast. Lady Bird's mom Marion (superb acting by Laurie Metcalf known for playing sheldon's mom in Big Bang Theory) , dad Larry ( good acting by Tracy Letts), brother miguel(actor jordan rodrigues) are a supportive family for Lady Bird who wants more from life. Saoirse Ronan did very well as Lady Bird who has a head on her shoulders and is confident that east coast has everything that Sacramento lacks. She lives her senior year with enthusiasm and looks forward to fulfilling her dream. She understands her dad's depression and appreciates her mom who is hardworking, affectionate and loving. Greta Gerwig's direction is commendable . Oscarworthy acting by Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf. Good screenplay."
63,Lady Bird,10,29 November 2017,Seems to perfectly capture a time and place in a certain person's life.,"'LADY BIRD': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An indie comedy-drama about a high school senior that's trying to deal with teenage life, while living with her overbearing mother in early 2000s Sacramento. The film was written and directed by first time feature filmmaker Greta Gerwig, who also co-wrote 'FARANCES HA' and 'MISTRESS America' (with director Noah Baumbach), which she also starred in. It stars Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tray Letts, Lucas Hedges, Timothee Chalamet, Beanie Feldstein, Stephen McKinley Henderson and Lois Smith. It's received unanimous rave reviews from critics so far, and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards as well. I really enjoyed it. The story is set in Sacramento, over the school year of 2002 and 2003. It revolves around a senior named Christine McPherson (Ronan), who has changed her name to Lady Bird. Lady Bird struggles to get along with her overbearing mother (Metcalf), and she applies to multiple colleges outside of Sacramento, against her mother's wishes. She also struggles to get along with the other students at her school, and romantic relationships with boys her age are especially a challenge for her. The story concludes with Lady Bird going to college, and you'll have to watch it to see where she ends up going.The movie is a great coming-of-age tale, that seems to perfectly capture a time and place in a certain person's life. Ronan is awesome in the lead, and Gerwig definitely proves she's a talented filmmaker as well. The film is funny, sweet and it touches on a lot of important issues, I think, to a young person Lady Bird's age. The relationship depicted between her and her mother is also really touching at times too. I definitely recommend it.Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us"
64,Lady Bird,9,28 November 2017,Life Can Be Many Things at Once,"I've always had a complicated relationship with Greta Gerwig as an actress. On the one hand, there's something very off putting about her, as if she's always being weird on purpose to turn others away before they have a chance to reject her. On the other hand, there's something fascinating about her that makes me want to return to her again and again.Watching ""Lady Bird,"" her wonderful, biographical coming of age film, made me understand Gerwig better. Saoirse Ronan plays the Gerwig surrogate and manages to both channel Gerwig's odd idiosyncrasies while at the same time create a completely unique and original character. The story picks up as Lady Bird, as Ronan's character prefers to be called, navigates her final year at a strict religious high school and contemplates going off to college and escaping the stifling environment of working-class Sacramento. Complicating that escape is the contentious relationship she has with her mom, played marvelously by Laurie Metcalf, who never misses an opportunity to criticize her and reminds her that she won't amount to anything even as she encourages her to make something of herself.""Lady Bird"" is the best kind of movie. It simply gives us a full- blooded character, full of complexity and contradictions, and asks us not to agree with her or side with her or even necessarily like her, but rather to spend some time with her and see if by the end of her story we can understand her. Ronan's performance is a minor miracle of acting, as is Metcalf's, and it will be a crime if both aren't recognized during awards season.Speaking of terrific performances, there are two others in the film to note, one by Tracy Letts as Lady Bird's dad, and Lucas Hedges, as a conflicted boyfriend. ""Lady Bird"" is a reminder that there are many different ways to define success, and that life, and the people that live it, can be many things at once. Grade: A"
65,Lady Bird,8,22 November 2017,Character study that will be familiar to many of us,"""Lady Bird"" (2017 release; 93 min.) brings the story of Christine McPherson, a/k/a Lady Bird, ""my given name since I gave to name to myself"". As the movie opens, Lady Bird and her mom are driving back to Sacramento as they are listening to an audio tape of Grapes of Wrath. Lady Bird laments ""I wish I could live through something"" and then lets herself fall out of the car, breaking her wrist along the way. Now in a cast, we get to know Lady Bird's daily life as she enters her senior year in high school at the all-girls Immaculate Heart of Maria. Lady Bird also has to deal with her overbearing mom. It all makes her want to go to college on the East Coast... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of noted actress and writer Greta Gerwig (Frances Ha, Mistress American, Maggie's Plan, and most recently sensational in 20th Century Women). Here Gerwig writes about something very familiar to her, as she grew up in Sacramento (but she refuses to call the film auto-biographical): the struggles of a teenager on the cusp of the liberating (?) years of going to college and setting out a life's journey more within her control. Even though the movie is just an hour and a half, it is jam-packed with non-stop plot developments, but the over-arching theme is clear. While billed as a comedy-drama, the movie is more drama than comedy, indeed the movie is bitter-sweet, but in the end more sweet than bitter. Gerwig provides outstanding direction to her two lead performers, Irish actress Saoirse Ronan (as Lady Bird) and Lauren Metcalf (as her tough-love mother). I can't help but feel that the movie is also Gerwig's love letter to her home town of Sacramento (a place I've never visited myself), making it look very warm and inviting. Bottom line: ""Lady Bird"" is a wonderful 'little' movie, and in that sense the complete opposite (and perfect counter- programming) for yet the latest salvo of superhero action movies from DC Comics (""Justice League"") and Marvel Comics (""Thor Ragnarok""). To each their own, but I'll take ""Lady Bird"" any day.""Lady Bird"" received immediate critical acclaim upon its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival earlier this Fall, and surely will be receiving a number of Oscar nominations early next year. The movie went wide this past weekend. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (exactly 4 people, including myself), but positive word of mouth will hopefully boost better attendance in the days and weeks to come. If you are in the mood for a character study that will feel very familiar to many of us, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Lady Bird"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
66,Lady Bird,9,31 December 2017,It took a while before...,I considered stopping watching the film several times because I was waiting for a moment when everything lights up and it takes boredom out of the process of watching a film. It happened at the 34:11 minute mark. After that it was like watching another film. It brought tears to my eyes several times after that moment.
67,Lady Bird,9,27 December 2017,As good as advertised,"I thought for sure this movie was being overrated. Nope. Great characters and great dialogue. Often that's more than enough. In this case, every moment felt real...the humor and tension all sprung from that place. While the film struggled a bit to find its ending point, that's probably because the director had the same problem I did: she didn't want it to end."
68,Lady Bird,8,8 December 2017,A Well Made Coming of Age Movie,"Lady Bird is definitely deserving of the praise it is getting. This movie was emotional, smart, and relatable. I wasn't really interested in seeing this movie at first because I thought I wouldn't be able to connect or relate to it, but I'm surprised to say that I connected to this movie a lot more than other coming of age movies I've seen. The best thing about this movie was Saoirse Ronan's incredible and realistic performance, and her eccentric but interesting character is one of the best of the year. Greta Gerwig has a bright future in Hollywood if she can keep making movies as great as this."
69,Lady Bird,8,7 December 2017,"Well written, directed and acted","Let me start by saying that, clearly, I am not the target audience for this movie. This is a movie to be seen by High School and College age females and their mothers.That said, I enjoyed LADYBIRD for what it was - a quirky, independent coming of age film with strong acting, a quirky central character and a strong, peculiar point of view (and voice) driven by writer and director GRETA GERWIG.So, let's start with Ms. Gerwig - she has been the Independent film world's ""IT"" girl for quite some time with such small off-beat films as FRANCES HA and HANNAH TAKES THE STAIRS, Gerwig has cornered the market on quirky, one-of-a-kind characters that Diablo Cody was known for 10 years ago. And that is an apt comparison, if you liked Cody's JUNO, then you'll like Gerwig's LADY BIRD. Much like that 2007 Oscar nominated Indy, LADY BIRD is quirky, interesting, strong in dialogue and character and low in plot. This doesn't mean it's bad, it's just meandering and takes its time getting to where it wants to go, if, indeed, it ever gets there. Gerwig's direction and writing is sure- handed - she knows exactly what she wants and how she wants to go there. I'm convinced that Gerwig will get her Oscar for this film (for Original Screenplay like Cody in JUNO) and, perhaps, just might get a Best Director nod for this as well (much like Jason Reitman got for JUNO).Speaking of Oscars, I decided to go see this film as I heard that SAOIRSE RONAN was a shoo-in for a best actress nomination (like Ellen Page Received for JUNO) and I couldn't agree more. Her work as an actress throughout the years has grown stronger and more confident and her performance as LADY BIRD is her strongest work yet. She portrays a complete character and, more importantly, a complete person who is relatable, yet unattainable. I was entranced by her character and her performance.LADY BIRD's quirkiness is counter-balanced by Laurie Metcalf's work as LADY BIRD's no-nonsense, ""get to the core of it"", unsympathetic mother. This was the surprise of the film for me. I didn't think that Metcalf had this kind of performance in her. Someone, please, get her an Oscar nomination for this work/role. As of right now, I think she is my frontrunner for Best Supporting Actor.Also lending strong work is Lucas Hedges as LADY BIRD'S boyfriend (that's 3 strong performances in a row for Hedges, following an Oscar Nominated turn in MANCHESTER BY THE SEA and as Frances McDormand's son in another Oscar favorite, THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI) and another Indy darling, Tracy Letts as LADY BIRD'S father.I'm glad I saw this film in the movie theater as the pacing is slow and the acting takes it time, so - as a captured audience - I remained transfixed to the screen. If I was watching this at home, I'm afraid, I'd have started looking at my phone or some other distraction.But, if you are a teen-early 20's female or a mother of a teen/early 20's, bring a hanky, you're gonna need it.Letter Grade: B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
70,Lady Bird,8,1 December 2017,"Despite all the possible traps of a coming of age film, Lady Bird is excellent.","Lady Bird Gets out of its Own Way to be a Great FilmLady Bird is a coming of age story of Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, and it's a well done slice of life. Her mother is overbearing and abusive, a bit of a cliché', but because the character is in the hands of the adept Laurie Metcalf, it works. And Saoirse Ronan is nearly perfect in the starring role. In fact, all the acting is top notch. Moreover, the script works. Clearly, the author, Greta Gerwig , took the time to edit and craft dialogue carefully so that it is natural. At the beginning of the film, the animosity between Lady Bird and her mother was over the top. But as the film and the characters developed, the dialogue made more sense. Her mother was unhappy and overly critical, but it was real. The mother isn't a pleasant character, Lady Bird is a bit too dismissive and dad (great acting by Larry McPherson) is caught in the middle. Yes, mom is annoyingly cloying, and Lady Bird is inconsiderate. And that is the way mothers and daughters are toward each sometimes. The boys in the film are also developed enough to not be stereotypes. It's amazing how a woman can write such realistic male characters. I would never think a woman could do that! The music mainly stays out of the way, and while some scenes go over the top, overall, it succeeds. Rating: Pay Full Price Good acting makes up for a few trite moments."
71,Lady Bird,9,3 November 2017,Honest storytelling with terrific acting,"""Lady Bird"". No, this film is not about Lady Bird Johnson! However, if you're a fan of films like ""The Big Stick,"" ""Juno,"" ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" and ""The Way Way Back,"" then writer/actor/producer Great Gerwig's solo run at directing/writing is going to be right up your alley. Saoirse Rona (""Brooklyn"") stars as the reluctant yet blooming teenage who's at ends with her overly critical mom (the always amazing Laurie Metcalf - HBO's ""Getting On""), while he dad (equally reliable Tracey Letts ""August - Osage County"" writer) sits quietly by. Since the story is a coming-of-age event, the excellent Lucas Hedges' (""Manchester by the Sea"") and Timothy Chalamet (""Interstellar"") each have a lesson to teach ""Lady Bird"". And, since every young female needs a BFF, Beanie Feldstein (""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"") fits the bill just perfectly. Gerwig presents a believable, honest, enjoyable and at times heartbreaking story that will surly touch viewers. There are no gun battles, CGI effects, loud explosions, superheroes or animated cartoon figures here to dazzle. Instead, for a pleasant 1 1/2 hours, the audience is given an opportunity to step into the McPherson family life, and the life of fellow Sacramento California youth, to experience all the various trials and tribulations youth and families must endure during this thing call life. With an indie feel, ""Lady Bird"" could both join the ranks of the film mentioned above and lead the category into Awards Season."
72,Lady Bird,9,3 December 2017,Fantastic movie!,What a great little movie about real people with real problems in real scenarios with very real emotions. There's a lot to get behind here from the mother daughter dynamics to the high school friendships to the coming of age story. Great performances where everyone gets to have little moments that define them and their role and you're left with a sense of a time and place and person that you rarely see anymore. Just a fine little story that worked on almost all levels. Well worth checking out and Gerwig shows some real promise for the future.
73,Lady Bird,9,26 November 2017,Triumph of A Young Girls Spirit & The Loss of Innocence,"Much has been said about this movie being a story of a mother (played by Laurie Metcalf) and her daughter ""Lady Bird"" (played by Saoirse Ronan). It's true that their relationship is a central theme in this ""dramedy"" but it is also a story of a father and his daughter. Lady Bird's father (played by Tracy Letts) is loving, gentle, sympathetic and sensitive to the changes in Lady Birds life. Even though he is going through some very tough times himself (depression & unemployment), his support for his daughter never waivers and we see him providing the emotional stability that Lady Bird desperately needs during her curious, awkward and turbulent high school years. Just as it seems her life is seeing some sunshine, unexpected events knock her back down again. However, Lady Birds incredibly positive spirit picks her up and puts her right back in the game. She refuses to let embarrassment or hard times rob her of the best years of her life and I think the audience is right their on the sidelines cheering her on. Greta Gerwig's script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is superb. Lady Birds story does not demand as much of Saoirse Ronan as her incredible role in Brooklyn (robbed of the many awards it truly deserved). But Saoirse nailed this role leaving no stone unturned with her great American accent, and wonderful sense of comedic timing."
74,Lady Bird,10,20 November 2017,The very best version of you...,"I love ""Lady Bird"". Watching Writer and Director Greta Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" is seeing life happen. Saoirse Ronan plays self-named ""Lady Bird"" Christine, the Catholic Girl School senior doing her best to leave her hometown in Sacramento in 2002. Laurie Metcalf plays Marion  Christine's Mother, who is the workaholic nurse covering double shifts to make ends for her family. Her husband, Lady Bird's Dad Larry, played by understanding Tracy Letts, who suffers clinical depression is laid off from his job. Lady Bird has a ""step-brother"" Miguel, played by bright Jordan Rodrigues, the UC Berkeley graduate working at 7 Eleven. Lady Bird and her Mom have the biggest hearts, yet often not gracious for each other. Lady Bird's chaste boyfriend Danny, played by Lucas Hedges, confesses ""Your Mom is so hard on you"" Lady Bird defends, "" She loves me."" In the moving scene, Lady Bird and Mom shop for prom dresses. Lady Bird asks her Mom, ""Do you like me?"" Mom replies ""I want you to be the best version of yourself."" Lady Bird says, ""What if this is the best version?"" Apparently, that isn't enough. They break your heart. Ronan and Metcalf have profound authentic screen partnership. Ronan is raw, hysterical, and compassionate. Metcalf is strength and tenderness in her quiet and measured words. ""Lady Bird"" is hilarious and touching in humanity. It celebrates being and loving the best version of yourself, acknowledging the unconditional love of those who see and listen you as greater. Director Gerwig's debut feature boldly looks at life touching all our hearts. In the opening car ride home after visiting State universities Lady Bird and Mom argue. Lady Bird wants to go to college back East. Her Mom reminds that they can't afford that, and besides she doesn't have the grades. Hysterically, Lady Bird opens the car door and leaps out the moving car. Later we see her back in Catholic School with pink cast on her broken arm. Gerwig brilliantly captures our attention. Lady Bird's best friend is Julie, played by kind hearted Beanie Feldstein, who is the sweet girl who suffers some over her appearance. Her divorced Mom has a live-in boyfriend. Math whiz Julie crushes on her teacher Mr. Bruno, played by Jake McDorman. Lady Bird would like to be on the Math Team, but she isn't good at math as Sister Sarah Joan, whimsically wise Lois Smith, points out. Instead the Sister convinces her to try acting in a play with another school. It's love at first sight for star Danny, gentle Hedges. Danny from the big Catholic family betrays Lady Bird in the surprise reveal. In her cultural exploration she jettisons BFF Julie for rich girl Jenna, haughty Odeya Rush, and pursues her romance with mysterious loner musician Kyle, charming Timothee Chalamet. Turns out mysterious is really the conspiracy theorist kid with the tragic family. Meanwhile, Lady Bird enrolls her Dad (Lett) to help her apply to East coast colleges unbeknownst to Mom. Lady Bird does her best to invent that best version of herself. Ronan makes us laugh and cry along the way. I laughed so hard while Lady Bird and Julie lie on the church floor eating communion wafers discussing the uses of ""shower heads"". When Ronan compassionately hugs Danny, who confesses his fear, I cried. When she holds Julie who doesn't have a prom date, who says ""Some of us aren't built for happy."" I had the biggest smile. As exasperated Mom tells her daughter, ""It's never enough!"" that breaks Lady Bird's heart and ours.""Lady Bird"" has the biggest heart of any movie I've seen. Ronan makes this so. Ronan and Metcalf reveal that unconditional love of Mother and Daughter in their fierce words and silence. They touch with their humanity. We are all the better for it. In the end saying, ""I love you"" is more than just thanks. That expresses the best version of ourselves. I think ""Lady Bird"" is the best movie of the year. At least it is my very favorite."
75,Lady Bird,10,16 November 2017,Ronan seems unable to make a bad film.,"I have seen at least three of her films. In every case she is outstanding. Unlike Brooklyn where she turned from a modest duck into a stunning swan, Ronan stays awkward while giving a seamless performance. As a parent with adult children, there isn't anything about this movie that seems ridiculous or contrived. All of the performances are top shelf. While mostly set in a Catholic HS, the RC faith, the religious orders, and the attitudes of the laity are never ridiculed nor caricatured. There is some salty language and a few strongly suggestive scenes. But I wouldn't hesitate to take a mature teen to see it."
76,Lady Bird,9,9 December 2017,Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird,"Greta Gerwig has more than earned her fair share of praise for her writing, such as scripts with Noah Baumbach like Frances Ha and Mistress America, and I find her a very warm and welcome presence in any, or pretty much all films that I see her in as an actress. She has a fine range of showing great humour and delivers and writes comedy and comedic moments very well, but she also has something about her and the films that she writes, or stars in that allows us to connect with her and just almost in a sense be around her and spending two hours, or an hour an a half with her is never boring, or a waste of time, but always these are very fulfilling and rewarding movie experiences and sometimes they can bring about great joy, or even cause you to reminisce about yourself and what certain situations were like for you that present themselves in her movies and often they can cause you to laugh, cry and even reflect, or look deep in yourself and for someone who looks for a little something more when I go to the theatre, I find these particular qualities worth very much and can instantly make a film a masterpiece in my mind. Having now just seen her directorial debut, Lady Bird, I am glad to say that everything I had just written above about her performances and her other writing credits can all safely be said for this new piece of work as well. Gerwig does not herself star in this new film and yet it is embodied with her charm and sense of self discovery and worth that most of her work brings about. Saoirse Ronan, who is a very great actress on her own, gives what I would consider to be the best performance of her very short, but what is sure to be a very lengthy career because how not just with this role, but previous ones as well, where she can totally immerse herself into any kind of character, or genre, so flawlessly and each time deliver a performance that can be subtle yet very powerful and here I think she gives a screen presence that shows just as Gerwig can deliver comedy, or comedic scenes, so can Ronan, and yet this is also a performance and film of great emotional depth and a film that requires much soul searching not just for the actors, but for us watching as well. Ronan captures what can be one of the hardest roles to nail down perfectly and that is playing a teenager and young adult who are trying to forge their way ahead in life and meeting any and all obstacles on the way. We see how at many times and stages of her life that she just wants to be noticed and accepted by those around her, from her peers to even winning the approval of her mother, who may seem distant and uncaring and yet loves her unconditionally, even if she has a difficult time showing it. We see how things for Ronan's character 'Lady Bird' as she calls herself is not always the most easy at home as her father who is a warm and deeply caring man is dealing with unemployment and because of this and other issues, has been dealing with depression issues for years. The household income is also a problem causing them to be extremely careful with their expenses and having the mother working at any and all hours and sometimes even double shifts to help care for her family. Lady Bird goes to a catholic school and yet seems to have no real exploration of faith, or any sense of a higher power, or belief system which is something that seems to change as she gets a bit older and also question the bigger and more important issues in life. There are the added pressures of fitting in at school, dating, sex and just trying to carve out her way and have a prosperous and rewarding future. Lady Bird has done many acts of rebellion and makes a lot of mistakes on the way, but this is also a sense of growing and yet after each fall she seems to pick herself up and eventually develops the emotional maturity and outlook that will get her not only through high school, but into the tricky stage of being an adult. Ronan's character brings about much joy and laughter and yet there are also times where we come close to tears and can identify with this character in more ways than one. The supporting performances by Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts, are moving and essential to this film. There were a couple of scenes with Metcalf, where her performance is so true and yet moving, I could feel tears building in my eyes, especially in a couple of select and yet beautifully moving scenes. Gerwig proves that she not only has the capability to act and write, but also to direct and put together a film that any young, or older person can identify with in some way shape, or form and is not only an enjoyable ride, but an enlightening and moving one that makes this film one that will linger long after you have watched it and is powerful enough to make you look at life and things a little differently. For this great sense of the human spirit and how great Gerwig masters writing what it means to be human, this makes the film a grand achievement that I think will only improve after repeat viewings. This is already an awards darling and expect it to continue to dominate any and all awards for very good reasons."
77,Lady Bird,10,25 November 2017,Saoirse & Laurie soar in this mother-daughter love story.,"So refreshing to go to the theater and watch an honest coming-of-age story about community, family & friendship for a change. Saoirse Ronan gives a fantastic performance playing Christine, the ''hard-done by'' teenager, and Laurie Metcalf as Marion, Christine's overbearing mother. The supporting cast all give incredible performances too. I would describe LADY BIRD as a *universal* story. Greta Gerwig has created a masterpiece considering this is her first *solo-directorial* debut and her writing is so spot-on too. Jon Brion's score is exquisite. 10/10"
78,Lady Bird,9,21 December 2017,Great Coming-of-Age Tale,"Up for multiple awards and sporting an impressively high 99% on Rotten Tomatoes, Gerwig's directorial debut is an extremely confident and poignant tale of a teenage girl as she navigates through one year of her life as a Catholic school student in Sacramento, California.Stylistically this independent feature is very reminiscent of the understated documentary vibe of Richard Linklator's Boyhood with it's impressionistic editing and willingness to just.....well...show a life (Ex. teenagers hanging out, practicing for a lame school play, first dates, being away from home at college).So I guess an alternative title for this would be Girlhood?Actually, I think LB manages to surpass Boyhood because it makes it's points regarding life and growing pains in a more efficient and energetic way in it's ninety minute runtime than Boyhood in nearly three hours thanks to it's disciplined editing and sharp dialogue.But by far the highlight of the film is the tumultuous dynamic between Christine and her mother (Metcalf), especially one particularly uncomfortable but funny sequence involving something as timeless as shopping for a prom dress. The acting by both Ronan and Metcalf is more than deserving of the accolades. Anybody who has ever had a difficult relationship with their mother will find a lot of moments in this movie that will hit close to home.Even though there is plenty of drama to go around, there are also a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, especially between Christine and her friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein). Probably my favorite little moment was a scene in which Christine and Julie are goofing around in a church that exhibits some very cute bonding moments presented in a hilariously unconventional manner. It all feels very down-to-earth, personal and...well....real.That is almost the key word here: real.Everything about this movie feels true to life. There are no big moral speeches, no over-the-top melodrama, no sense of self-importance, or calculated soundtrack inserts.If I had any complaint about this film it's regarding Father Leviatch, Christine's theater instructor played by Stephen McKinley Henderson. There is a certain reveal regarding his character about halfway through that never really ends up having a pay-off. I know the movie is called LB, so in the end it is about Christine journey but I wouldn't be surprised if something significant got left in the editing room because Leviatch just kinda disappears after a while."
79,Lady Bird,10,26 November 2017,Ronan and Metcalf give Oscar worthy turns and Oscar gold beckons for novice filmmaker Gerwig as well; One Of The Year's Best Films,"LADY BIRD (2017) **** Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts, Beanie Feldstein, Lucas Hedges, Timothee Chalamet, Odeya Rush, Lois Smith, Jordan Rodrigues, Marielle Scott. Hilarious and poignant dramedy written and directed by actress Greta Gerwig (her big screen debut as both) about a headstrong, independent seeking teenager (Ronan in an Oscar worthy turn) who wants desperately to break free from her drab life in Sacramento, California with her future set on for an East Coast liberal arts college. Her only deterrent is her loving but piece-of-work mother (Metcalf who also should be a lock for an Academy Award, for Best Supporting Actress and a career high performance), whose complex way of raising her family hinders there fragile relationship to boot. Glimmers of JD Salinger, Wes Anderson and John Hughes exist in the fun, funny and super sharp indie; one of the year's very best films."
80,Lady Bird,10,12 November 2017,"One of the best coming-of-age, mother-daughter films","One of the best coming-of-age, mother-daughter films since JUNO and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. LADY BIRD depicts what it really means to be on the cusp of adulthood; taking the big leap to move away from home, etc. It has many 'fresh' aspects to it. The main protagonist, Christine aka ''LADY BIRD'', she's not perfect! She has acne, she makes mistakes, etc, and played so wonderfully by Saoirse Ronan. Gerwig has really established herself as a strong director and screenwriter. Her screenplay is probably one of the strongest original screenplays. I look forward to watching again. Hopefully it will be a strong awards contender!"
81,Lady Bird,3,23 November 2017,Boring,"Although this movie was only about an hour and a half it felt like over two hours. I kept looking at my watch to see when it would end. The acting was good, but the plot felt like the writer took everything that could affect a teenager and threw it into a movie. I generally like thought evoking movies, but this one was just not compelling. Of the three people I went with, only one would recommend it and then only to a limited viewing audience. A lot of people really liked this movie, at least in the reviews, but there no one in the audience was saying how much they loved the movie as they exited the theater."
82,Lady Bird,9,10 December 2017,Not Just a Slice!,"Storytelling at it's best,this one just Isn't just a Slice of life, but a whole loaf!! Oscar worthy story about lessons in parenting, teen choices, and coming of age. For me Laurie Metcalf as the stubborn Mom steals the show. At times you thought the movie was coming to an end to only find out the amazing ride wasn't quite finished. This was a beautiful ride you need to take yourself on, one that you won't want to end!"
83,Lady Bird,10,9 December 2017,"""Fly away home""","Lady Bird (2017) was written and directed by Greta Gerwig. It's a coming-of-age story about Christine McPherson, portrayed by Saoirse Ronan. Christine hates her name so much that she insists that everyone call her Lady Bird. (She's not kidding. She means it.)We follow Lady Bird through her senior year of high school in Sacramento. Although Sacramento is the state capitol, it's really California's ""fourth city,"" after Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego. Lady Bird has a love/hate relationship with Sacramento. She recognizes its beauty, but she really wants to get out of it. Lady Bird lives ""on the wrong side of the tracks,"" as she says. I had to smile when I saw her home--many people would love to live in that house. However, her parents expected a different career trajectory when they were young, and they were unable to stay on that trajectory. This was their starter house, but it's still their house.Lady Bird's mother loves her, but she's obviously compulsive, and she never let's up. Laurie Metcalf portrays the mother perfectly. There's another actress who really hits the mark--Beanie Feldstein, as Julie Steffans, Lady Bird's (sometimes) best friend.This is a movie that you don't want to miss. Saoirse Ronan is a brilliant young actor, and director Gerwig know to bring these skills onto the screen.We saw Lady Bird at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. However, it will work as well on the small screen. Lady Bird has a remarkable IMDb rating of 8.5. It's a pleasure to see a film this good getting the recognition it deserves."
84,Lady Bird,9,21 November 2017,Gerwig's coming-of-age story stands out from the crowd,"Coming-of-age films from green, independent filmmakers have a tendency to hit their mark at a surprisingly higher rather than other stories, but something about Greta Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" feels more like a bull's-eye. Her semi-autobiographical snapshot of a high school senior exploring her identity has an assured wit and a firm grasp on the emotional truth of that life stage.Even though she's playing someone close to her age, Saoirse Ronan continues to display a dazzling versatility as Lady Bird/Christine, a young woman at a Catholic private school who dreams of escaping her native Sacramento to attend a college or university on the East Coast. Consequently, she rejects the pragmatism of her middle-class, blue-collar parents (Tony winners Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts), namely her well-intentioned but admittedly cold mother. Determined not to let anyone put her in a box, Lady Bird subconsciously turns her senior year into an experiment in self-discovery, hoping to fashion an identity that suits her and the vision she has for her life.Gerwig's script is not guided by plot so much as story lines that emerge and drift away, some of which are fleeting and some of which run throughout the course of the film. In addition to college acceptance, there's her foray into drama club, a couple romantic interests and her ongoing challenges with her mother. The film comes together with brilliant editing, especially the moments of comedy. With the help of editor Nick Houy, Gerwig demonstrates uncanny comedic timing in the way she constructs scenes. ""Lady Bird"" earns and accumulates laughs early and effortlessly, and so much of the force behind the humor comes from quick, well-timed edits. Also, her cast is clearly having a blast making this movie and she makes sure the camera is there to capture the funniest, most authentic moments.The editing also plays into the dramatic elements as well. Gerwig has incredible belief in the viewer to connect the dots and intuit the emotional consequences of the bigger moments in the story. The film's first big moment of melodrama, in which Lady Bird makes a startling discovery in the bathroom, jumps immediately to some several minutes or hours later, when she and her best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein) have an emotional moment to Dave Matthews Band's ""Crash Into Me."" Most films would've resorted to melodrama and really stewed in these moments; Gerwig keeps her film moving.it's amazing what she fits into 94 minutes. The mileage she gets out of each scene and the moments she includes in this story is a lot of what sets ""Lady Bird"" apart. She's able to trim all the fat because the meat of the story is so substantial. Every interaction, every character brings something to the table and exhibits this universal truth that there's a side to everyone that isn't visible in how they appear and behave, a lesson Lady Bird badly needs to learn. The most tender and sensitive example is in the mother-daughter relationship that in many ways is the central dynamic of the film. Lady Bird and Marion represent the clash of idealism and pragmatism that are so often at the core of teen-parent discord and the scenes they have together perfectly encapsulate that tension, but also the love and bond. Metcalf's performance captures all the love and devotion and the stubbornness and frustration that makes her both the ""villain"" of the film and the one you sympathize with. Marion and Lady Bird are so authentically realized in the writing and in the performances that it's almost like being able to step back and objectively look at your own parent-child relationship.Although most audiences won't quite relate to the film's ""love letter to Sacramento"" aspects, dreaming beyond or feeling attached to where you grew up is still a universal sentiment, one that Gerwig handles with care because in so many ways that push-and-pull embodies a lot of the wrestling that ""Lady Bird"" does on the more micro level with its characters. So many films touch on this aspect of growing up, but ""Lady Bird"" makes and arrives at these critical points with the kind of authenticity and thoughtful, intentioned writing that the film feels as though it's a collection of someone's actual lived experiences and relationships. Gerwig's voice and Ronan's performance meld into one truthful story that hits all the funniest and most sincere notes without lapsing to clichés and conventions, a truly special feat of filmmaking from a first-time director.~Steven CThanks for reading!

85,Lady Bird,10,18 November 2017,"I Know Why ""Lady Bird"" Sings...","Greta Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" is a captivating tale of love, life and coming of age. Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan), a 17 year old self proclaimed 'lady bird' feels caged in her small community hometown of Sacramento, California.New York City street lights, glossy magazine inspired beauty, the illusive enchantment of fairy tale love and an irrepressible penchant for sophisticated affluence beckon Lady Bird to spread her wings and soar into horizons of no dreams deferred and the undisguised voyage of life.A beautiful, kaleidoscopic journey of chasing personal passions, conquering defeat and rising to the challenge, ""Lady Bird"" is a must see.#ILoveLadyBird"
86,Lady Bird,9,10 January 2018,Coming of age at its best..,"Lady Bird has become my favorite ""coming of age"" film ever. Actually, it is much more than an ordinary coming of age film. Great storytelling, great acting, great cinematography...
The thing that affected the most about the movie is how successfully convey the feeling.. I did not go to a catholic school, I've never been in Sacramento, I've never hoped to go to an art school in New York.. But yet its feelings are so relatable, so close to heart.
Also, we cannot ignore the incredible acting. Saoirse Ronan is definitely one of the best actors of her generation. Actually since the Atonement, we know how successful she can be. And I'm sure she will get much more credit for her brilliant work. And the other actors of the film; Laurie Metcalf was amazing as the mother. And Timothee Chamalet; he is definitely the shining star of 2017! Extraordinary performances in the best movies of the year..
And lastly Greta Gerwig. What an amazing film making for a debut. We really need film makers like her. We need such refreshing approaches in the film industry. I'm looking forward to see her next projects..
All in all, great film. Congratulations to all who are involved."
87,Lady Bird,10,22 November 2017,Filmmaking at its purest...,"Lady Bird is a straightforward and affectively written coming-of-age story composed of identifiable characters and dilemmas regarding adolescence and family relationships with strong performances to back them up. It's marvelous how these art house films where you are essentially watching an everyday person's life go by can sneak in a subtle narrative and effortlessly absorb the audience. Lady Bird is filmmaking at its purest, another 2017 great."
88,Lady Bird,9,19 November 2017,A Wholly Original Coming of Age Film,"Sometimes a film doesn't need to involve an elaborate plot or characters. Sometime a film does perfectly fine by showing regular people in regular situations. Lady Bird deals with a young woman, who happens to prefer to be called Lady Bird, as she goes through her senior year of high school, applying to colleges, and doing what girls do at that age. Saoirse Ronan plays Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, who is a rebellious and eccentric young woman who wants anything but staying home in Sacramento for life beyond high school.The film moves at a rapid pace and for a good chunk of the film you don't really know the direction the film is taking. ""So what is really the point?"" is the question I continued to ask myself. But in reality, the answer was right in front of me. This film is about a mother and a daughter, the trials and tribulations they go through, but how they ultimately realize the love they have for each other is mutual though constantly tested. And even though this film is certainly a comic of age story, it by no means is your typical romantic coming of age where boy meets girl or vice versa.This film is a coming of age story of a mother and daughter. Both tremendously played by Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan respectively. What I found so compelling is that as weird as Lady Bird can be in her approach to life, it's still written in a way that is relatable to the average person. In fact, I can't say that I know first hand what that relationship is like, being a guy, but there's something so special about the way these two people rip each other apart but are aware of the meaning of each other's presence in their lives. Writer-director Greta Gerwig does such a beautiful job of presenting this scenario in several scenes throughout the film. And really, I shouldn't expect anything less from her with the particular choices she has made with acting in the last decade or so.From Gerwig's fast moving script, to the bold choices made by Metcalf and Ronan, to the strangeness of Lady Bird's character, all the way to the heart breaking moments towards the end, Lady Bird is easily one of my favorite films of the year. There are a few subtle lines and scenes near the ending that I won't forget and are some of the more powerful things I have seen/heard in a film this year. Major props all around. I love Lady Bird.9.5/10"
89,Lady Bird,10,17 November 2017,"...this Bird, you cannot change","Saoirse Ronan plays Lady Bird. We all knew a Lady Bird. In high school, in college, at work. Male or female. The misfit toy, the square peg, the rebel without a cause. Someone nobody thought was anything, but in reality, extraordinary. Extraordinary by just being who they are and unafraid of what others will think of them in doing so.Lady Bird is a triumphant film of 2017. Only one emotion swept through me as I sat and watched. Pure joy. Lady Bird is an entirely memorable character. In some ways, a feminist answer to Max Fischer from Rushmore. The way she navigates through her humble catholic school upbringing is hilarious. She uniquely adapts to the pitfalls of the coming-of-age. The discovery of love, sex, popularity, rejection and the anticipation of college. At the same time, Lady Bird wishes she was something more and much to the chagrin of her own mother, who wishes she could just be normal. Laurie Metcalf's performance as Mrs. McPherson is heartbreaking and real. A mother in the cross- hairs of unconditional love and utter disappointment in her daughter. Lady Bird's dynamic with her mother thought the film is chilly and dismissive, but deep inside, she fully appreciates all that she has given to her, and vice-versa.As a former socially anxious, awkward teenager, I can certainly relate to wishing I were somewhere else, wishing I was someone I wasn't and perhaps unappreciative of what I already had. Lady Bird doesn't just simply rehash the coming-of-age story for us all to harken back to way back when, but to reflect in an adult manner, what it means to have a family that cares about you through it all. For that, Lady Bird is worth every second of your time. You'd be unfortunate to miss it."
90,Lady Bird,2,12 November 2017,"Banal social commentary masquerading as a deep, artistic film","A trite, masturbatory piece tailored towards middle aged cat ladies and those on the path to becoming one. The drama, despite being filled with talent, lacked any semblance of depth, and could easily be likened to a comedy when you begin to view it in its proper context. It is essentially an incredibly mediocre male coming-of-age tale, but with the genders reversed. ""Lady Bird"" is the projection of what third wave feminists (for some reason) wish women were. She is the emotional pillar for those around her; she is stoic, bold, confrontational, daring, and always the first one to initiate romantic advancements. In other words, she is a caricature of masculine virtues and behavior, but as a *17 year old girl*. In the few places where she is found to be emotionally lacking, her parental counterpart (whose character is infinitely more believable by virtue of her background and hormonal makeup) steps in to fill the shoes (and/or pants). In accordance with this narrative, the men in lead roles have seemingly been injected with soy from birth. Soft-featured incompetent doughboys who lack the agency to engage life, functioning instead as submissive basket-cases, vectors through which Lady Bird asserts her outright dominance and emotional stoicism. That's the catch. That's the novelty driving this movies popularity (besides decent acting), a young girl who acts like a man. How risqué, how compelling. The screenwriters and director should really give themselves a pat on the back for this one. Anyway, there's certainly more to be said of the social agenda etched into every corner of this films script, but I've not the time nor the patience to spend another minute of my life on this trash. It is completely incongruent with reality, and therefore unrelatable to anyone who isn't living vicariously through the protagonist.The only redeeming factor of the film was the degree to which this absurd gender reversal dynamic managed to add a veneer of comedy to virtually everything that took place (especially the ""serious"" scenes)."
91,Lady Bird,5,18 December 2017,This movie is not as superlative as all of these other reviews make it out to be,"OK, folks. If you're going to read one review of this film. Read mine. Why? Cause I tell it like it is and I don't heap praise on anything unless it's truly justified. Reviewers like to say that Gerwig's take on ""coming of age"" is somehow fresh, with a steady stream of humor, heart, and honesty. Well, it's not fresh. Hardly. Yes, there is humor, heart, and honesty. But it doesn't merit the stupendous accolades this film is getting. I saw this picture with my wife who definitely had her issues with her mother growing up in a rural town and while she could relate with Lady Bird, it was like, so what? In the end, do I ultimately care so much about Lady Bird? No, I don't. She's amusing. She's smart. She's funny. And in the end, I'll forget about her weeks and months down the road because she's like many other rebels who have come before her and who will come after her. Contrivances about in this movie. The fat girlfriend, the closet gay boyfriend, the get drunk let's have sex moment..I mean, come on. Talk about cliche!The acting is uniformly excellent. I actually liked the father who got some of the least screen time of all. He was an excellent counterpoint to the bitchiness of Lady Bird's mother. The movie DRAGS towards the end, where there are a number of moments where the movie could have and should have ended. There was ZERO need to show Lady Bird calling home from college after getting drunk and throwing up. It adds NOTHING to the movie or Lady Bird's character. A more appropriate ending would have been Lady Bird finishing off her time at high school. I don't think Gerwig knew exactly when and how to end this film because she had to stretch it to get to 90 minutes and I think she shot some of these ending scenes to help her get to the finish line. Every movie needs that opening inciting incident within the first 20 minutes. Greta has done enough films to know that and she smartly has Lady Bird jump out of a moving car to create a heightened sense of drama between her and her mother who were both arguing about what college she should attend. It sets the tone early about the tempestuous relationship between the two. Gerwig knows what she's doing in constructing a screenplay but this story doesn't have a lot going for it. Sacramento is WHO CAREsville. This could have been filmed in any other WHO CARESville town. A relationship between a mother and daughter - it's just not enough to make you care. In the end, this is a so-so picture and does not merit all of the praise it's been getting. This movie is not different from other coming of age movies with the exception of the writing and I give credit to Gerwig for her skill when it comes to crafting dialogue. But it's not enough to save this movie. When I watch a movie that I love, I can't wait to purchase the DVD. I will not be purchasing Lady Bird as part of my movie DVD collection. Does not merit repeat reviewing."
92,Lady Bird,10,7 December 2017,I Thought They Were Real,"This is a stunning tale. Christine, ""Lady Bird,"" is a teenager, getting ready to graduate and move out of Sacramento. Her parents are polar opposites. Her mother, a victim of alcoholic abuse as a child, has trouble saying a single positive thing about her daughter. Lady Bird is creative and alive and her own person. What I like was that she had foibles and normal teenage propensities. She is looking for love and thinks she finds it, but circumstances leap in front of her. She wants out, but her mother does everything she can to block her independence. They are strapped for money and the mother thinks Lady Bird is too big for her britches. We are introduced to characters that are never over the top. There are few, if any, Hollywood explosions. They talk and interact and they are incredibly believable. The biggest problem is that Lady Bird's mother leaves the daughter no avenues, and so the girl must lie and deceive. There are several peripheral characters who are portrayed with admirable restraint. I look forward to seeing the next offering from this first tie director. Great movie but not for everyone."
93,Lady Bird,10,7 December 2017,"""Lady Bird""- An absolutely sublime and endlessly charming slice-of-life 'dramedy.'","In a year filled with many surprise treats, it should come as no shock that while most people await a certain high-profile space opera, one of the year's most charming and engaging films should emerge under the radar. That being writer/director Greta Gerwig's absolutely fabulous slice-of-life comedy-drama ""Lady Bird."" Starring the stunningly talented Saoirse Ronan along with a cast of other magnificent performers, this coming-of-age tale hits you right where it counts, supplying laughs, gasps and even a tear or two along its incredibly efficient ninety-minute run-time.Christine McPherson (Ronan) is your typical angsty, unsure teenage girl. She has aspirations for bigger things despite her humble upbringing, worries about boys and her classes at an uptight Catholic High School, and is trying to find her way in the world. Oh, and she's also rebelliously began to try and rename herself ""Lady Bird"" in predictable defiant-teen fashion. The film follows her through a year in her life in 2002, as she observes the world changing in the post 9/11 climate, tries to figure out both familial and romantic relationships and eventually begins to figure out the person she really is, all while facing an uncertain future.The peculiar thing about the film is that, in a sense, we have seen this all before... just not QUITE like this. In the scope of coming- of-age stories, the tale of ""Lady Bird"" might seem all too familiar. And yet, the movie excels splendidly thanks to the thoughtful and sensitive writing and direction and the awe-inspiring turns from every single actor involved. Greta Gerwig guides the film's amusing story and wildly identifiable characters with a sense of confidence and glee. It really is an exceptionally assembled film in terms of pacing, structure and visual aesthetics. It has a mild sense of gritty realism that keeps you thoroughly invested in the story, while injecting just enough exaggerated moments of levity to tickle the funny-bone with some regularity. It's simply charming start-to-finish, and I look forward to seeing what Gerwig cooks up next if this is her solo directorial debut.Saoirse Ronan continues to prove to be a revelation amongst her peers, delivering a character that is both troubled but well-intentioned. Likable but not always inherently good. Much like any person. While I'm somewhat ashamed to admit this is the first film I've seen where she's had a starring role, I'm definitely interested in seeing the rest of her work. She's just amazing. Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts are great in supporting roles as Lady Bird's supportive but long- suffering parents, and both are given a lot of great moments to build off of and a surprising amount of development. Timothée Chalamet and Lucas Hedges are good fun as some of Lady's earliest romantic conquests and are good representations of realistic figures one encounters in life. And special commendation goes to the adorable Beanie Feldstein, whom portrays Lady Bird's best friend, Julie. Feldstein is just a ton of fun in the part and the chemistry she shares with Ronan builds up much of the film's heart.I'm almost at a loss for words when trying to think of a single thing to say against the film. And I just... can't. It's a film that's virtually without fault, meeting and excelling at everything it sets out to do. The cast is amazing. The direction exceptional. And the writing simply sublime. And it is a film that I can with some certainty is among the best of the year. And so, I'm giving ""Lady Bird"" a perfect 10 out of 10. Please give this charming, entertaining and oft-heartfelt film a shot! It took me by surprise, and it might very well do the same for you."
94,Lady Bird,9,20 November 2017,Great film,"Saoirse Ronan stars as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, a teenager in Sacramento, California in Greta Gerwig's solo writing/directing debut. She is not a terribly good student, nor does her family have any money to speak of, but she is committed to attending university in NYC. The film follows her episodically through her last year of high school, showing her relations with friends, boys and her intensely critical mom (Laurie Metcalf). This is a low key, extremely engaging film that I thoroughly enjoyed, but didn't really blow me away as I was watching it. It snuck up on me though ... it has some really beautiful moments that surprise with how they deal with familiar material in novel ways. Playwright Tracy Letts (""Bug"", ""Killer Joe"") is great in a low key role as her father."
95,Lady Bird,10,19 November 2017,"Best movie of the year, by far","I love Greta Gerwig. I admit it. As far as I can see, her movie roles are all a version of herself, which is utterly charming. So obviously I had to go see this.Yet ANOTHER coming of age film? Yes and no. Yes, the same subject matter. No, not the same approach. It's like saying Lord of the Rings was a movie about talking trees. Greta, who both wrote and directed the movie, sustained the high level throughout. How often do you see this? Usually the first 10-15 minutes are funny, then they run out of ideas. But Greta kept the ideas coming, and the result was (to me anyway) a completely new take on a high school girl coming of age.For one thing, I was laughing out loud every few minutes. I won't give away the best lines, but they were all fresh and unexpected. Let's just say that the football coach as director of the school play was inspired. But so was the mother. And the father. And the friends. And the boy friends. It was all just brilliant. Time and time again Greta was faced with yet another trite situation that she made fresh and funny. And the acting--except for the lead character, we had journeyman actors. But they all did a great job. Not too little, not over the top. Just right. And Saoirse not only made herself LOOK like Greta (same smile....) she SOUNDED like Greta. A friend we saw the movie with was convinced Greta was playing herself in the movie. We had to convince her it wasn't. Whether this was intentional or not I don't know, but in either case Saorirse did an outstanding job."
96,Lady Bird,10,28 October 2017,Best Comedy of 2017,"And definitely one of the best films of 2017, period. As a matter of fact, the entire film is wonderfully acted, written and directed. (If Laurie Metcalf doesn't at least get a supporting actress nomination there is simply no justice in this world.) The characters are refreshingly real, multi-dimensional, nuanced and fascinating, and the female characters, especially, are blessed with legit real dialogue and not the usual bogus generic tropes. One of the cinematic delights of the year."
97,Lady Bird,10,5 December 2017,"A film that as you watch it will bring back memories for you! It's a nice coming of age story blended with laughs, emotions, and discovery!","Everyone remembers their high school years and how for many it was about acceptance and the need to fit in and be liked and popular by the right crowd. And director Greta Gerwig shows this with this picture and what it's like for a young girl to grow up and come of age, while making memories and life and love is learned along the way. Yet ""Lady Bird"" is blended with laughs and feel good emotions of joy and tears that will make any watcher relate and feel like it's real to their own memories of high school.The story is set in early 2000's in California with Christine(AKA Lady Bird)McPherson(Saoirse Ronan) a young girl who's a little stubborn and lazy in book matters as she just doesn't apply herself in an educated manner. Her sights are set more on travel and seeing culture of arts and life on the east coast as she wants to go away to college in New York. Also Lady Bird wants to make more friends and be popular by being in the school play.Yet she's behind the 8 ball as her mom Marion(in a great turn from Laurie Metcalf) is over bearing and conservative and worries and challenges the thoughts of her daughter as she tries to shelter Lady Bird by sending her to a catholic school. Still Christine fights the system and wants adventures in other forms by exploring romance and you guessed it wanting to have sex and lose her virginity! Lady Bird is like many young girls as she wears sexy colored bras, and has sex and goes to the prom with the boy she enjoyed passion with and loves listening to her favorite band boy music(good to hear ""The Dave Matthews Band's"" ""Crash into Me"" from the late 90's early 2000's).Thru it all after graduation this little lady takes flight and spreads her wings to freedom and escape. Still thru the journey of experience and discovery Lady Bird is left with emotions of love and memories that will never be forgotten as time and growing pains help form her. Overall good film of learning life and having experience all while reflecting on how and why it makes one become who they are."
98,Lady Bird,8,27 December 2017,Perfect Indie Feature,"Absolutely loved it, this is exactly the kind of movie that I enjoy.You can feel the creative spirit, that everyone was passionate and cared about this project, such a rare thing these days. ""Lady Bird"" is unique, quirky, funny, moving. If you like movies for being art and for being human and real. If you want a movie that isn't about brainless explosions and action. If you want a movie that makes you think and question and reflect. If all of those things sound good, then this movie is for you. There's something so special about the rare art of mid-budget indie films. It's the 1 in a 1000 movies that I always want/try to find. It has that magic that I feel when watching a Wes Anderson film for example or Amèlie, etc. I can't quite describe it in words. Just different. Good different.Really curious what's next in store for Greta Gerwing (director/writer). Would love to see her land some huge project, as a result, perhaps something like Captain Marvel? She'd be perfect. 
It makes me really happy seeing this movie get all the praise and set/break all the records for female directors and writers!!! I wish this film wasn't in a limited release because more people need to go see it!Finally, my suggestion would be: don't read anything about it (ironic), don't watch the trailer, just go in blind as I did (or knowing as little as possible). That's truly the best way to experience movies like this."
99,Lady Bird,5,20 December 2017,"It wasn't terrible, but it definitely wasn't a 10","After seeing and hearing so many rave reviews on this movie, my husband and I decided to use passes to go see it. Maybe our expectations were just set way too high going in after seeing this rated so highly by many friends and on here too, but it was not the caliber of movie we hoped it would be and definitely not worthy of a 10 in our opinions. It wasn't terrible, but it was severely lacking in a cohesive story line and realism, which I was not expecting to think given all the reviews of how ""relate-able"" and ""real"" the movie was. Maybe because it touched on teen sexuality from a female perspective is the reason it got so many great ""realistic!"" reviews? The acting was definitely where it shined. The tiny one or two bits of wisdom/learning moments and tiny tidbits of humor thrown in were great too. But other than that, it felt very forced and rushed, not ""real"" at all. The ending felt very out of place and rushed as well.We went in understanding it was a coming of age story about a girl in catholic school, but the plot line was just not cohesive enough IMO. It was overly dramatic at times (which sure, is some teen girl experiences, but at times it was too over the top to be believable because of other details the plot included). The overworked mom being a jerk to her got taken way too far to be believable given the other details in their story. The way they ended it did not make sense with the rest of the events and details. The best and most realistic characters for me were actually her adopted brother and his girlfriend. They would've made a more interesting ""coming of age"" movie in my opinion with lady bird playing an overly dramatic, whiny side sibling role."
100,Lady Bird,1,28 November 2017,"Someone one is paying people for the reviews, honest to God!","I mean it has some good acting, but the story is trite, and seriously uninspired. There is nothing to see here that hasn't been done in about one million other Hollywood films exactly like this one. Its the typical Hollywood depiction of the 50's, complete with some conservative strawmen to bat around. Its got your typical ""brilliant forward thinking woman who doens't need any men"" sort of thing. I can't recall what was up with the father in the story, because I just don't remember him or why he wasn't there...or really anything else. I kept on falling asleep."
101,Lady Bird,2,30 November 2017,Trite and predictable; Maybe interesting for a 12-y.o. girl,"Ugh! I kept waiting for the story to get interesting, and it never did. I wouldn't have bothered sitting through more than 5 minutes of it if it were on TV. I was willing to give it a chance because I liked how Frances Ha came together at the end after what felt like a slog, but this was trite through and through. Even worse, it wasn't even interesting visually."
102,Lady Bird,6,1 December 2017,Decent Coming Of Age Story,"I saw ""Lady Bird"", starring Saoirse Ronan-The Grand Budapest Hotel, Hanna; Laurie Metcalf-The Big Bang Theory_tv, Uncle Buck; Beanie Feldstein-The Female Brain, Neighbors 2:Sorority Rising and Lucas Hedges-Manchester By the Sea, The Grand Budapest Hotel. This is a teenage girl coming of age story that covers most of the plot points you have probably seen before, but it is executed decently. Saoirse plays a 17 year old girl in Catholic high school in Sacramento, California in the early 2000's-I think I remember seeing a sign saying 2002 or 2003. She longs for adventure and wants to go to college anywhere but where she lives-she wants to go to New York, in particular. The main problem is money. She lives in the poor side of town and she is not making good enough grades for a scholarship. Her mother, Laurie, is a nurse working double shifts to cover bills. Beanie is her best friend at school and Lucas is her first boyfriend. Saoirse and Laurie are close-they talk about everything-even though they do get into disagreements. It's rated ""R"" for language, teen partying and sexual content-brief graphic nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes. Oh yeah, I feel I must mention that the brief graphic nudity is from a men's magazine that Saoirse is looking at. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but I'm not the target audience. I would wait until it comes to cable. If you are more inclined to these types of movies, you may enjoy it more than I did."
103,Lady Bird,6,27 November 2017,Good not great,"We went into Lady Bird without overly high expectations despite the critical acclaim, so we weren't disappointed. The film is well put together and the acting is excellent. The issue we have is with the plot, or rather lack thereof. We couldn't get invested in the story. Whatever happened to a beginning, middle, and end?"
104,Lady Bird,5,24 November 2017,Meh,"I hated it. It was like watching an episode of Blossom. The only good part of the movie was Lucas Hedges, and he's barely in it. I thought I was going to see a cool, funny indie movie after seeing the trailer. But it was just a poor teenage girl in catholic school movie. I'm not a poor teenage girl in catholic school, so I could not relate."
105,Lady Bird,5,30 December 2017,"Wrong Side of the Tracks ... but still ""rich people's problems"" version of Coming of Age","Aw, I admit it. I'll watch anything with Saoirse Ronan in it ... such a fine actress, possibly the best of our time. And while I love a coming of age story, the drama in this family setting seemed unrealistic and contrived. Sure dad lost a job and they never moved out of their house on the ""wrong side of the tracks"". But this young woman could go to college. Something of which millions of people can't even dream. Mother-daughter arguments over which college to attend fall a bit flat when we live in a reality where so many can't attend. It started to sound a bit like silly ""rich people's problems"" so I sort of didn't feel super attached to any of the characters (except maybe the mom).I liked the eccentricities of Ronan's character Lady Bird. But I feel the story line could have been much more compelling. Glad I streamed this film instead of pay for it in a theatre ;)"
106,Lady Bird,6,24 December 2017,disappointing,"I thought saoirse ronan was wonderful. but many elements of the film just seem way off. 
first, it seems derivative of ""20th century women,"" and annette bening was much better as the mom than laurie metcalf. 
major points in the film were told rather than shown: the nun says that lady bird is a good writer, but we have no direct experience of her writing talent; the yellow lined papers say that the mom is insecure underneath her anger, but we have no direct evidence of that. the dad is depressed? we are told that, but he doesn't look depressed at all - just an amiable, kind-hearted loser. compare to sam elliott in ""off the grid."" lady bird says, ""i know i'm a liar""; but there is little if any footage of her mastering her lying and cheating.
what's with the name, ""lady bird?"" it evokes lady bird johnson, who would seem to have nothing in common with our protagonist. 
why does she want to go to an east coast artsy school? we never see her reading, watching art films, writing poetry, etc. 
she is arrogant (to apply to columbia), she lies, she cheats in class. shouldn't these be problems to overcome? 
if the film is an homage to sacramento, why no freeways? sacramento is dominated by highways 5, 99, 80 & 50. compare to la la land, in which the freeway does have a role. 
what's with the hispanic brother? not explained or used as a plot device, so it just seems random. also, i thought i read in the yellow, lined sheets, ""after i had your brother at age 40"" - though i may have misread as the sheets were visible for about 3 seconds. but shouldn't the brother be adopted or be explained to have a different father?
why does kyle say, unprovoked, ""you're not the first girl i had sex with; i've slept with 5 girls before you?"" i get why it hurts her, but, come on, who says that?!? he is presented as a musician and quiet reader whose dad has cancer. is that motivation to be a total jerk?
perhaps i went into the film expecting too much, but this is no ""juno."""
107,Lady Bird,4,2 December 2017,"never achieved escape velocity, it's a little movie, the microcosm remains just that.","the main character jumping out of a moving car at the beginning of the movie set expectations too high for this nice beginner director movie. The mother/daughter relationship was okay, and there were things in the middle of the movie that started to really get my attention, such as the back stories of some of the characters. The family dynamics were good and you found out certain things subtly, such as the late motherhood, the obviously adopted brother, the kind but depressed father. The bathroom as a place of mother/daughter communication was cool but the idea that a middle class ranch house only having one bathroom in Sacramento is silly/unnecessary. Also, the disjunction between the mother's professional role as a psychiatric nurse and her vaguely crazed behavior at home doesn't make sense, it's too different, way past the ""wounded healer"" syndrome of most people in psychology/psychiatry, believe me, I know these fields, all to well. Otherwise, it's kind of a standard ""coming of age"" high school transition to college movie with nothing really much happening to a middle class, somewhat privileged white girl/woman. There is something done well with the idea of place memory and belonging, however, that did hit home, this is seen in the car scenes transposing mother and daughter, although most scenes were not well framed or imagined. The general sense is that the movie is almost there, but it's really not that great, you want it to be better, in the mode of ""Boyhood"" ""13"" ""The Last picture show"" Some good bits but just barely worth your time in a big screen movie theater. And much of the acting was good-ish almost better than it needed to be."
108,Lady Bird,5,18 December 2017,Wait a minute...,"Saoirse Ronan has an interesting aura, but that doesn't keep this from being a mediocre story about uninteresting teens (and an unlikable mother). We needed two apologies the audience never gets: Her first boyfriend never says he's sorry he was unfaithful, but instead asks Lady Bird to cover the fact he's gay.
And it should've been the mother to write or call Lady Bird to apologize for not seeing her off to college--instead we get Lady Bird saying thank you to her overly critical mother. The acting was fine--Tracy Letts was good as a sympathetic dad.
Sacramento looked great. But the story does not deserve all the great raves. So just a warning--you might be disappointed."
109,Lady Bird,9,6 January 2018,An Incredibly Personal and Entertaining Story,Http://nickkaminskysblogspot.blogspot.com/2017/11/review-lady-bird.html
110,Lady Bird,1,26 December 2017,Steaming Pile of Dog Skat,This movie is very boring with poor character development such that I never care about any of the characters or their issues. This is the archetype for the overrated circle jerk indie film that is not worth watching.
111,Lady Bird,1,3 December 2017,the most boring movie of the year!,"I have no idea how this movie got this high of a rating as I kind of felt that the movie is one of the most boring movies I've watched in 2017. It seems that the trailer has all the good scenes. I'm mainly talking about the ""idea"" of the movie & the flow. I am NOT referring to the performance by any means."
112,Lady Bird,3,10 December 2017,Really?,"This is not the type of movie anyone would recommend to someone they like. Therefore, the jagoffs on this site seem to think it's okay to recommend to strangers. I don't go to your house and take a dump in your bathroom sink and leave. This is what it feels like with these ""glowing"" reviews of one of the most self-indulgent, explanation of the Millenial jerks who populate this world today. Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson is a talentless, subpar student who is determined to propel herself out of the duldrums of Sacramento, California in hopes of a more enriching life in college on the east coast. The reality is, she is stuck in middle class Hell. With a Dad who battles depression and a mother who battles...well, the world. Of course this sad movie needs to saddle itself with quirky brother whom we spend a TON of time wandering how this relationship transpired since the guy is a Mexican. Oooooo...clever. See, Lady Bird is a Catholic school girl delinquent who thinks she has the small town world figured out. Though she is woefully hobbled by...her own naivete, she has no other reason to leave town other than...? She isn't talented in anything. Has no ambition. And quite honestly is annoying. Saorse Ronan plays the titular character, and she does well. But the shining performance HAS to go to Laurie Metcalf. The overbearing yet cautious mother who refuses to allow Lady Bird breathing room. The massive problem with Greta Gerwig is that she wants it all. She wants the ""Sixteen Candle"" scene where Paul Dooley sits at the edge of the couch telling Molly Ringwald how they forgot her birthday (in this movie, they switch it, where her father celebrates her birthday). But they also want you to get a taste of Millennial angst. Here's a hint to Gerwig...no one cares. You're annoying. Everyone in this movie is annoying. Except Metcalf. To that extent, she is, of course needs to win the Oscar for rising above poor over-treaded material. If you've had the slightest sense of a teen movie...this is it. Every single cliché you can think of. The morons here who believe this is unique...Jesus, watch any adaptations of S.E. Hinton. It's far more accurate. You know..because we haven't seen that 2-pump chump joke in comedy before."
113,Lady Bird,2,27 December 2017,Ladybird really wasn't that strong of a character,"Gerwig really had to create a VERY passive cuck dad character to use as a comparison for labeling the mom and daughter as strong. Ladybird really wasn't that strong of a character... which makes this 'coming of age' story boring. And on top of that, the story was basically comprised of just a bunch of random events that felt like it was taken from the vague memory of the writer's poor recollection of their senior year. All opportunities for the Ladybird to develop any sort of drive or gumption were just tossed aside as we basically just watched her walk through the scenes of the movie.But on the bright side, A+ for the acting. Saoirse Ronan was very believable and Laurie Metcalf is always a joy to watch."
114,Lady Bird,6,4 December 2017,Enjoyable enough but rather surface,"I left the theatre after watching Lady Bird basically feeling nothing - not moved, saddened, hopeful, annoyed, just...nothing. I really like coming of age movies or books so had high hopes for this one, but I felt like it skimmed the surface of some interesting themes or ideas rather than actually exploring them and making something out of it. I would have liked to know more about the main character's mother, father, brother - all hinted at interesting hidden feelings or secrets, but the movie never actually went there to explain or add context to anyone's actions or reactions. It was also hard not to feel like Ronan was not just doing a Greta Gerwig ""omg I'm so awkward and I have no idea that people find this charming"" impression. I found a variety of scenes in the movie confusing (in the sense that I guessed the director was trying to evoke emotion or create a plot but it didn't really achieve it IMO):-why was the mother so weirdly mean to the daughter? that didn't make a lot of sense to me. If the mother had some deep issues buried, the one sentence about her mother being an ""aggressive alcoholic"" didn't really make me care enough about it to warrant her controlling behaviour -Christine (sorry can't bring myself to actually call her LB) expresses an interest in moving to NY for the ""culture"", but what about her life or behaviour suggests that she is at all interested in anything other than boys or getting out of her town? what is she hoping to achieve there? what DOES she want to see or do? -the director doesn't handle the whole ""I'm going to ignore my best friend and try to be friends with this popular girl instead who is inevitably going to be nasty to me and so I'll return to the original friend"" plot line very well - again, it's an interesting idea to explore, but there didn't seem to be a lot of reasoning as to why Christine went in that direction. She didn't seem at all interested in being popular/regular and so why the random action? -she also didn't seem to especially care about having money or not, and no one was really mean to her about it, so it also didn't make a lot of sense to me that her and her mother would want to go and check out the open houses of really expensive houses - if they had a deep shame of not having a lot of money, they didn't make me care enough about it, and it didn't seem to make sense for either characterI did like some parts, the best friend was funny and a good actress, and there were some comedic elements, but nothing that made me really laugh. I felt that the director tried to cover too many themes and ideas and didn't really hit home with any of them.Overall, a 'meh' experience for me, and seemed more style over substance."
115,Lady Bird,4,6 January 2018,When Hollywood tries to be quirky,"My apologies to the director of this movie because I am very supportive of fellow ladies that make films, but this review is not going to be very heartwarming. ""Lady Bird"" follows a teenage girl in Sacramento, CA, on her journey into adulthood. This is the premise of the movie and as though it sounds like many coming-of-age log lines you've already heard, this movie is nothing like them - because it doesn't follow up to the expectations it rises.A coming-of-age movie has to do at least one of the following things - firstly, be ""relatable"". The demographic audience of this genre watches these kind of movies because they want to relate to the anti-hero, the underdog. It's very hard to do that when the main character is an entitled, bratty girl who lives in S a c r a m e n t o. This fact was supposed to get watered down by financial issues of the family or the fact that she is ""weird"" and unpopular - but it just wasn't convincing enough.This brings me to my next point, which is acting. I'm sure that the director saw something of herself in Saoirse Ronan but Saoirse is just not this character - she doesn't look 18, she doesn't look OR act quirky/weird, she is simply too good looking and put together to play this role. If we don't believe all these things in the first place, we're never gonna buy the acting...Oh, the acting. I don't want to stay on this subject for too long - the cliché dialogue itself is enough to make the viewer roll their eyes but a good actor can even make this fly if they just say the words... but no, every and each sentence about a small-town girl with big dreams you've all already heard a million times before had to be super-emphasized. The story is clear. A girl doesn't feel like she belongs. She tries to be something that she's not. Some big grown-up things happen in her life that make her realize who she really is and she accepts that.
However, this has just been seen too many times before. Just last year, The Edge Of Seventeen succeeded in transferring the charm of a high-school weirdo to the big screen. But, this movie just doesn't do it - it's just not believable, at moments awkward to watch (not an emotion you want the viewer to feel), unrelatable, not even pretentious - it's just basic and nothing, it's nothing, it didn't make me feel anything, it wasn't even so bad that I would turn it off. So, again, if the director ever reads this - don't worry, you still did a better job than me and yes, I'm sure that making your first feature is hella hard, but this is just my honest opinion that I hope you can take something out of it..."
116,Lady Bird,6,7 December 2017,Perfectly fine,"Who can deny Saoirse Ronan is winsome? Who uses ""winsome"" to describe anyone anymore?Lady Bird is a fine film, replete with good acting and a paint-by- numbers, coming-of-age storyline every middle-class white person could find relatable, or at least relative. There's relative poverty, relative lies, relative places, and relative relatives.The biggest lesson learned is that if you pay attention to the world around you, someone else might interpret that as love for the world around you, or at least the aspects of the world around you to which you pay attention are ones which you love, because why else would you pay so much attention to them, regardless of whether or not you are paying attention to them consciously?Coming of age for Lady Bird includes a first weed, a first bone, and a first scratch-off. We get a prototypically gay young man, introduced as the strong singer who's afraid to touch mammaries. Perhaps greater screen time would have revealed he also enjoys architecture, queery theory, and feather boas.Having never lived in Sacramento, I nevertheless imagine I would also want to move to New York as a way to solve all of my problems. Change comes from within, unless you're full of wanderlust, without which we would wistfully remain stationary, only exploring inwardly who we are, who were were, and what will happen next."
117,Lady Bird,5,29 November 2017,"An extremely overrated (still entertaining) film, but we still have no explanation for the eponymous name.","Lady Bird (2017) Oh, Greta Gerwig's Quirky coming-of-age tale, So sincere yet sweet, Parents, girlfriends, boys, college. Changing in Sacramento. Still, why the nickname? Why appear a long trailer, Although a great one? Scenes in a blender missing Crucial, instructive segments. (Somonka is a Japanese form of poetry that is essentially two tanka poems, the second stanza a response to the first. Each stanza follows a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern. Traditionally, each is a love letter. This form usually demands two authors, but it is possible to have a poet take on two personas. My somonka will be a love& hate letter to a film?) #Somonka #PoemReview"
118,Lady Bird,6,1 December 2017,Over-rated,"I base my assessment of a movie's 'greatness' on the story, acting, photography, and music. The acting was excellent. Saoirse Ronan's acting is captivating. The story is well, it's been done before so many times. It was entertaining at times. Maybe I have watched too many movies for over 70 years. The photography was average and the sound was at times very amateurish. The music - well, it didn't add to the experience. I would never compare this movie to a Woody Allen movie, never."
119,Lady Bird,4,27 December 2017,I really could not care ...,"Since I am not a woman or a teenage girl from Sacramento, I just could not relate to this movie at all.Really Greta, what on earth made you think the masses of movie watchers of the world would or could care about your supposedly unique upbringing in the tiny demographic of Sacto, CA?You most certainly did not have amazing and unique experiences as a teenager. In fact, most all of us have had similar and probably more interesting experiences when we were teens.The acting and cinematography were very good but those two things do not make a movie great. It needs an interesting story, one that appeals to more than just teenage girls. Sorry to say, but you might want to stick to other scripts -- avoid writing your own."
120,Lady Bird,9,15 January 2018,a perfect story of leading how to get lost,"Greta Gerwig ..! I think she is one of the most brilliant writers of the 21th century. Frances Ha was the very first surprising experience, then Mistress America was a stunning movie to be the next.. and now this; Lady Bird. She has such a unique, authentic way of her own that you can recognise the characters she create even not knowing that the story belongs to her. These are girls who are experiencing ""finding oneself"" in different periods of life and in different ways. Yet, these are not simply lost girl stories, what makes them different is that these characters are not scattered by the wind, they are fully aware of the need of getting lost and they are the ones choosing how to, they lead the ""getting lost"". Lady Bird, in particular, is a stunning story of a young girl so vulnerable yet so strong. There are ups and downs, comes and goes, yet you can always feel that lead. Moreover it is a impressing mother-daughter story. Although there are no big tragedies one can always sense that strong sense of breakdown.besides the perfect story, the actors and actresses are also amazing, and Saorise Ronan is simply fascinating! It was a true breakthrough performance!"
121,Lady Bird,4,14 January 2018,Ehhhh,"I came into this movie expected something to wow me noting the great reviews it received. To be honest, I thought it was a little flat. Someone who every year sees and blogs about the Oscar contenders, I just don't this one was in the same ball park as others. Don't get me wrong, I do reward Greta Gerwhig for a job well done in her debut--but I simply don't see the film in the same light as others. I love Laurie Metcalf in this film and think she should definitely get praise for her performance. Ronan's performance was take it or leave it for me. Just cannot relate to the film, did not leave me wanting more."
122,Lady Bird,8,14 January 2018,An honest depiction of seeing that childhood magic stripped away.,"Ladybird's personality is the perfect mix of quirky, emotional teen and honesty. I'm surprised the a story that is centered on a relationship between mother and daughter resonated with me. Add another classic to the list of classic coming of age movies."
123,Lady Bird,9,13 January 2018,Good film with great performances,"Lady Bird is definitely one of the best coming of age films made recently. The Edge of Seventeen from 2016 could be put in the same category but this one is still better in my opinion. It will really hit close to home with everyone who live and grew up in a place where not much happens and can't wait to leave it and enter the world of excitement to try to live to the fullest someplace else.The thing that sets Lady Bird apart from most coming of age stories is that it feels much more realistic. The characters are wonderfully written, you really care for them, feel what they are feeling and you sympathise with them. The struggle of teenage years and how difficult these times are for the parents as well, falling in love and getting heartbroken for the first time, applying to colleges in a family that is struggling financially are all themes that Lady Bird covers with great authenticity. Saoirse Ronan shines in her role and is proving once again that she is one of the best young actresses working today. The supporting cast really deliver as well.If you love stories about young people growing up, you like films that make you feel something and are full of witty dialogue and real characters, you should not give this one a miss."
124,Lady Bird,1,13 January 2018,Shallow Slider On The Surface,"There are things which will always remain a mystery to me - for example, why so many people love that awful abomination that is Once Upon A Time In America, or that boring thud, Godfather II? The same conundrum is this 2017's teen drama, Lady Bird. I was waiting eagerly to watch this, I watched this - so, what can be said? Not much. This is a very shallow, sliding on the surface, empty misfire of a film, and what is more incredible - we have seen this all many times before. We sure have. I am sorry, people, what merit is in showing a highly mundane, repeated trite cliche of a teen's life - what didn't we see before? Catholic school? Teenage love? Firstsex? Troubles at Math? Depression? Conflicts with Mom, as well as with siblings? Come on, guys, we saw this time and again.
Saoirse Ronan is nice, but nothing more than that - she never managed to break out of ordinary, highly predictable lines and verses. Laurie Metcalf is nice, too, but again, never above average. 
OK, consider this is just an average bland movie, I can buy this. What I cannot buy, is this screaming approval of happiness. Ok, maybe, I am old and am not touched by this teenage angst anymore, but come on, even this stort could have more depth and color. Here, we see a cold, shallow, gray depiction of life of people we do not feel compassion to or like. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film as ""unique and original and fresh and wonderful"" and ""appealing"" - well, I must disagree - there is nothing unique, or original, or fresh here - in Russia amd all around the Globe we saw better efforts. I know I will be not understood, but here I stay - this is a very poor movie, even in comparison with worse movies of 2017."
125,Lady Bird,10,12 January 2018,Couldn't be better!,"I personally loved this movie, i have already watched it twice and i want to watch it again, everytime i laughed with the same jokes and cried at the same parts, a movie that touched me emotionally it's already a great one. Very proud of Saoirse and Greta! that was the greatest debut ever, and i expect a big future from this girls :)"
126,Lady Bird,7,9 January 2018,An endearing movie with brilliant actors that suffers from its realness,"Lady Bird isn't the typical 'coming-of-age movie' that you would expect upon hearing that term. It tells the story of a teenager who struggles to find her place in her surroundings and questions omnipresent themes such as wealth or sexuality. Nothing special, right?Indeed, what the movie tells of isn't too much of a revelation. Nothing we haven't seen before in other movies of that type.
What makes Lady Bird better is the acting, first and foremost. There are absolutely no flaws to notice in the cast's performance on screen. Everybody, from Saoirse Ronan as the protagonist to every little side character, delivers an astoundingly perfect performance. Some of the most impressive acting i've seen in a while. Especially the fact that these people master the roles of completely ""normal"", real-life people so well impresses me. Nice work, really.Another good thing about the movie is that (partly because of the acting) the characters are very likeable, each on their own. Combined with Greta Gerwig's very real, yet still witty and never boring script, it makes for a very endearing movie overall. You can instantly relate to characters as soon as they come on screen and throughout the film, you start to care about them, moreso than in other movies.Now comes the part that made me vote a 7 and not a 10, and I do know that it's very subjective and maybe not perfectly righteous. Anyways:
As the film progresses, I felt (especially in the last third) an increasing feeling of confusion or irritation when I was trying to understand or rationalise the characters' actions. Now, I know that the protagonist is a teenager and the state of confusion or the sometimes random-seeming decisions and feelings are probably intentionally portrayed that way, but I still think one could have gotten across that particular point of uncertainty in a less boring and more understandable way - even while visually remaining with the confusing theme. The way it was eventually done almost got me bored at certain points where I really lost track of what's going on for a few minutes. One good thing, though, is that after these minutes, there was often a line or a shot that pulled me back into the action, which made me finish the movie on a decently positive note.Lastly, camera, sound and visuals are appropriate for this kind of movie. It's quiet, no huge effects or crazy camera movement, in other words just perfectly suited for the genre.So to conclude this review:
I loved the acting, I liked the screenplay and how relatable and loveable the characters are.
Despite it perhaps being intentional, I didn't like the state of confusion that creeps upon the screen and the dialogues towards the end of the movie. Also, the fact that Lady Bird starts, runs and ends without context or some sort of epilogue, adds to that confusion as we don't have any background to justify certain decisions in the movie."
127,Lady Bird,6,8 January 2018,Adolescence in a decent movie,"A journey through teenage years, with which we easily identify with multiple situations portrayed, a couple of good performances and a movie that can be seen from beginning to end in a satisfactory way.
The film may be able to pull off one or another smile, there are a few dispensable scenes, but it turns out to be reasonable."
128,Lady Bird,3,31 December 2017,clearly reviews here are paid for,"I always wondered if there are companies out there that movie producers pay to post many good reviews. this movie proves they exist. the most boring movie ever, and yet has 8+ rating? makes no sense. maybe it is just a woman movie made by a woman for women? But even my wife couldn't sit through after 40 min and said it is unwatchable. So it can't be that. Lots of gratuitous vulgarity doesn't make a movie better by the way. someone should tell that to the directory. the movie just keeps going from one scene to another with no rhyme or reason as if just trying to fill blank space. I would give it less than 3 stars, but i suppose there are 1 and 2 star movies out there."
129,Lady Bird,4,1 January 2018,Average,"If someone were to tell me to, 'name one of life's bitter disappointments', I'd have to say watching, based on its reviews, a much-lauded film - one with a Metacritic score in the 90's - for it to turn out to be really very average. Thankfully it doesn't happen very often, but when it does, ooh, it smarts! That just happened with me and this film.Don't believe the hype."
130,Lady Bird,7,17 November 2017,A cute and interesting film but leaves a little to be desired,"I went to see Lady Bird with moderately high hopes after reading some reviews. I enjoyed it and it was well done but I found the story and dialog to not be original enough or clever enough to give it equally high praise as some reviews have. It's good for a few chuckles but 'best comedy of 2017' it is not, or at least I hope there is something funnier."
131,Lady Bird,6,13 December 2017,"Promising start, felt incomplete","I was drawn to this movie about Sacramento since I live near there. The
cinematography was beautiful. With the soundtrack I was reminded of
""Sideways."" Unfortunately, the story was not as well developed. Several
characters seemed to have been inserted into the movie without any real
development (the boyfriend and the brother and sister, to name a few examples.) The saving grace was that it does not go on too long, the story is a positive one about coming of age, and the movie feels authentic and genuine. It''s a decent date movie, better than many others."
132,Lady Bird,7,17 November 2017,Quirky,"This is an entertaining, well-made film with comic elements. As a mother-daughter story, I thought it failed. The mother depicted is an abusive narcissist, and the movie seems to soft-pedal this.Lady Bird's mother is verbally abusive with occasionally frightening results. Yet ultimately the film does not really explore the effects of this on Lady Bird (Christine). The abuse is ultimately depicted as just typical human flaws and a conflictual mother-daughter relationship. At the end, I felt like I wasn't sure what would become of the main character and I don't think the filmmaker knew either.The film does have many memorable comic scenes of Lady Bird's high school life at a Catholic school. The film also addresses ageism and adoption, which is rare for a Hollywood film. It's worth seeing, but if you think this is an accurate depiction of normal mother-daughter conflict you are wrong. The mother is highly pathological and the depiction is more like an accurate portrayal of a pretentious narcissist."
133,Lady Bird,7,7 November 2017,"Alternately incisive and plodding, coming-of-age film gets a passing mark","I always appreciate a film about the personal upheavals of reaching young adulthood. To be honest, I found this film mildly annoying at times. Maybe because it's a film that just doesn't hold back on the raw emotion of growing up. The characters are very real and therefore the taste it leaves is not always palatable. The story of a 17-year-old girl growing up in Sacramento and her personal travails with her parents, with school, with her friendships, with boys and with her hopes and dreams didn't exactly grab me initially.The good news is that it's so superbly acted that I was able to absorb it and enjoy the wonderful moments of truth in terms of one's relationships with those you've grown up around. In that regard, this film cuts very close to the bone. I just wish the narrative had been more brisk and not as deliberate. For a film with this short a running time, it feels long. Toward the end, it drags a bit. Perhaps Greta Gerwig in her directorial debut is still figuring how to end a film on the perfect note.But again, the performances here are tour de force, especially Saoirse Ronan who is exceptional as the teenage girl who spends most of the film coming to grips with a sense of self and an independent identity, something hard-earned in a difficult family. By the end of the film, we've come to know her completely. Recommended to those looking for a good character study."
134,Lady Bird,1,8 January 2018,walked out,"Why bother to watch, let alone make, a movie about a whiny dishonest teenager? I could not empathize with her and ended up walking out of the movie halfway thru. Maybe the third movie that I have walked out of in my life."
135,Lady Bird,7,22 November 2017,"Good for an American dramatic comedy, but...","Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf work well together in this coming-of- age story, in which drama fades into comedy, and comedy fades into drama, seamlessly. The problem is the ending. The ending, it seems, must be clear, and it must be positive, because that's what Americans want. Thus, the ending is totally a cliché, because in real life complex parent-child relationships, even when they resolve themselves into something positive, almost never resolve themselves in such a quick and positive way. I'm not arguing for a tragic ending, as might have occurred in a European movie (even Almodóvar movies sometimes end well). Rather, I think the director should have left the audience hanging a bit...instead of forcing the ending to quickly resolve itself positively."
136,Lady Bird,6,4 January 2018,And the award for Most Overhyped Mediocre Film of the Year goes to...,"Maybe the issue is that there's nothing technically ""wrong"" with Lady Bird. It plays it safe, the story is relatable enough to any average Joe/Jane, so it's hard to hate. 
However, there's nothing special about the film. There are countless other similar indie films with far more engaging scripts and stories to be told. Lady Bird is rather full of already-done cliches from already-played characters. Laurie Metcalf is the only form of entertainment to be found, and even she isn't given a heap of content to work with... Much of the characters' stories and challenges were underdeveloped, and the dialogue was mostly cute nothingness. You've got a dad that the writer placess the ""he's struggling!"" tag on... but we don't really see it. You've got a mom that the writer places the ""she's really hard on her kid"" tag on... but we don't really see it. You've got a teen that she places the ""she hates her hometown... wait. No she doesn't... for some reason unknown... yes she does... nope. She loves it. Who knows!"" tag on... and we try to figure that mess out. There are some funny lines in there delivered well by the actors. But for the most part? It ends where it starts. There's no arch. No development. A lot of unexplained (though the lack of depth doesn't call for much). No climax. No challenges. No real reason to not get up and take a bathroom break while it's playing (you wont miss anything- promise). Average film. In every sense. It's worth a 7, but the sheep following the hype of this film and contributing to it gets it a 6."
137,Lady Bird,4,3 January 2018,we've GOT to stop rewarding brats.,"Maybe i'm too old for this movie (just turned 32) but the way i was raised, i would get bitch slapped the way lady bird behaves. I'm so fed up with films that glorify bratty behavior. (the same thing happened with 'birdman'. emma stone's character was the worst) if you relate to this movie, i'm glad i didn't know you in high school. (or ever) points for saoirse ronan cause i do love her as an actress, and the film had some funny parts, but it was so obnoxious, i couldn't finish it."
138,Lady Bird,7,28 December 2017,Not special about this movie,"This is a good movie but I wouldn't classify it as 10/10. There isn't anything exceptional about this movie or it doesn't add anything else from other teenager movies: clash with parents, being rich and poor, first boyfriends, virginity, prom, going to college....
It does really reflect the immaturity of the writer/director. The good points in this movies are the performances: Saoirse Roman and Laurie Metcalf. They shine throughout the film. The film seems a collection of small stories that the director put together in a rush.
I still would recommend tp any teens age 12-18"
139,Lady Bird,9,26 December 2017,90%,"PROS The best coming of age movie of the year-Great performances by the entire cast especially Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf
-Very relatable with the many things Lady Bird Goes through, and felt like a real life family and story
-The comedy is smooth and not over the top
CONS
-More personal stuff for me, just didn't connect with certain story lines as much as others"
140,Lady Bird,7,7 December 2017,little review about movie and point about it at the end,"Lady Bird was pretty great and I definitely felt sucked into the movie the whole time. There really weren't too many things that really distracted from the experience aside from one thing I'll mention below. The pace was very fast paced but it felt earned and purposeful. Greta Gerwig wrote Frances Ha and Mistress America and I really liked Frances Ha, but Mistress America left me cold due to the final act and horrible direction. I'd pretty much call Lady Bird a Noah Baumbach movie with a much better sense of what it wanted to accomplish and how to do it. But one line felt weird to me.I'm a big fan of looking at a movie's world through a character's perspective. It sucks you into the world of the movie and definitely enhances the experience. But one scene I felt went against the regular boundary between audience and character. There's a scene where Lady Bird talks to her mom and it goes like this (I don't remember it TOO well).""Didn't you ever have a mom that didn't make you have everything be perfect?"" ""My mother was an abusive alcoholic.""I don't understand the purpose of that line. Lady Bird must've already known that and even if not, that's be a pretty awkward way to say it. I don't remember it cutting back to her reaction either. It's just meant to be a sort of ""Hey, you weren't expecting this were you?"" To the audience. I would've had it so her mom would've left the room, maybe about to cry. There was really a lot of room to put you in the character's heads here. They could've slowly revealed it, and soon had it dawn on you that her mother traumatized her. It's not a bad scene, just one that felt as it wasn't utilized to its full potential for me. Pretty great movie overall, though."
141,Lady Bird,7,5 December 2017,Not Lady Bird Johnson.,"Here's a movie that will make every ten best list this year. Laurie Metcalf's performance will be honored this award season. Satires Ronan may be a tad old to play a high school girl. Good supporting performances all around.The movie has many moments. Ronan bails from the car rather then take her mom's abuse. She encounters her boy friend in an uncomfortable situation. She bails on her so called friends to get to the prom. So many moments that work.It's a small movie that is getting good theatrical distribution. If you miss it in theater it is the kind of mother daughter relationship movie that will play well in the comfort of your home. Is it a ""chick flick""? If so it's an excellent chick flick."
142,Lady Bird,,27 December 2017,Is there really a lower middle class high school girl so self-centered annoying?,"I don't know what this film really wanted to portray a girl, who would be the product of a lower middle class family. But how come a young high schooler could afford attending a private Catholic school, with a mother just a nurse and a father soon to be unemployed? The screenplay writers obviously didn't know how much would have to pay for a child in a private Catholic school. There's one private church school in our neighborhood from the kindergarten to high school. The tuition for the kindergarten is about $6,000 a semester, and the parents are required to involve a lot of school projects and affairs. Periodical Donations are also encouraged. This particular church has used the profits by running a private school and a church to become the largest local land and properties buyer. A luxurious single family housing project the church bought a few years ago now is under construction, boasting 4,000 sqft. living spaces for each house just next to the school. The church is also a franchise business, got several churches dotted around. God is the easy mean to get rich.Now back to this film. This leading character, a girl called herself ""Lady Bird"" educated in such school would have turned out to be such a piece of self-centered, selfish, rude, mischievous product. Her shallow and naive ambition was to go to one of the east coast Ivy League universities, obviously another private school system for higher education. I rarely saw a movie character, especially young and a female, could be such annoying and so blindly selfish. Her family by all means, is just lower middle class family, both parents have struggling career, definitely not rich, even a bit more close to poverty, yet this girl just has such unrealistic dream. Her hatred to California or Sacramento is also a mysterious thing that the film didn't tell us the exact reason why. But one thing I am sure is her hatred of being a member of a poor family, a so so student without any merit and talent, all she got is day dreams, nothing else. Some of the reviewers tagged this film as a coming of age film, but I just can't agree. The anti-social attitude of this young girl is nothing special but a common outcome of any young boy or girl whose parents are not rich enough to provide them with enough welfare. There's nothing special about this film and it's very painful to watch this girl's naive, childish, selfish and even rude attitudes toward her mother and others, like everybody owes her."
143,Lady Bird,7,27 November 2017,A Good Movie. But Not As Good As Everyone's Making It Out To Be.,"I'm very disappointed with what has come out this year. I usually see a few truly great movies in a given year with three or four perfect 4-star films ontop of those. That has not has happened this year. We've gotten some heavy CGI-oriented action extravaganzas with just a few films I could actually take seriously. Even the ones I could take seriously weren't enough. Lady Bird is one of those.Saoirse Ronan is guaranteed to win her first Oscar as the titular character. Her name is Christine, but she prefers to be called ""Lady Bird"" (just like Hank Hill's dog). She lives in Sacramento in the early 2000s and desperately wants to blossom out of her town as high school is ending. She must deal with the shenanigans of being a young woman about to go to college and finally getting out of her weird catholic high school. Notice the word I use: ""shenanigans."" Because that's exactly what this movie is about. The movie follows trivial and everyday events in Lady Bird's life. None of these feel special. None of these things are moving. There was no take-off point. The most popular element of praise I've seen for this is people praising its dead-on realism and its very little amount of potential clichés. Just because a movie is very real, is that really worth a perfect score? Just because its original, does that automatically make it great? That answer to both questions is no. It's all in the execution. A movie could be totally original, but if it isn't executed well, who cares? And do you realize how many movies are just as realistic as Lady Bird that are far superior? Too many to count. Has the film industry gone that far downhill?As much as I am badgering this, it is definitely thumbs up. The characters were relatable, there was warmth and love, and the acting was all mighty fine. Was I underwhelmed because of hype? No. I just heard through the grape vine that this got good reviews. That's it. it wasn't until after that I checked out the extent. The main reason I'm not on board with everyone else is it didn't hit me. I appreciated everything this had to offer, but almost none of it did anything to me. To me, a perfect score (or near perfect score) is the strength of the positive reaction I get. Frankly, nothing this movie offered was strong. I'm not at all saying suicides needed to be involved or there needed to be sex and cheating, just a better and more complex script. Because let's face it, the movie is very basic, has no reach, has little layers, little subtext and is only skin deep. Definitely thumbs up. It's more than a marginal thumbs up. But I certainly hope the hype doesn't grow. And I REALLY hope I don't get so annoyed by how high its acclaim gets and become sick of it like with other movies.7.5/10 (6.5 or below is thumbs down)"
144,Lady Bird,4,8 January 2018,Disappointingly empty,"I'm officially starting a petition to ask for a TED with Mia Hansen-Løve and Richard Linklater, both to talk about how to make great coming-of-age films, and I want Greta Gerwig to sit on the front row so maybe she could learn something from them instead of Noah Baumbach, from whom she seemed to get all the wrong things about the subject: a completely naive understanding of generations gap; characters are written as goofy caricatures (are you all serious that none of you got bothered with that ""uglier-fatter-loser-best friend"" trope? At least in Super Bad Jonah Hill got Emma Stone), a script that struggles to deliver lines that feel truthful; and it constantly confuses honesty with superficiality. Nothing really resonate, nothing really cuts deep. It ends up feeling generic and the same old cute-indie-vibe wannabe we've seen so many times before (and got so annoying these days).Saoirse Ronan is definitely destined to greatness. I don't think it's the case for Greta Gerwig behind the cameras.The hypes of award season are such a strange thing."
145,Lady Bird,4,9 January 2018,I NO LONGER TRUST IMDB BECAUSE OF THIS FILM!!!! TRUTH!!!,"Ok, this is my first time reviewing a film on imdb, i do check out others' reviews before i go see a movie most often. THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTIGATION OPENED BY IMDB MANAGEMENT AS TO WHY THIS FILM HAS AN AVG RATING ABOVE AN 8. ITS ABSURD THAT THIS FILM IS SO HIGHLY RATED!!!! THE MOVIE IS OK AND AVG AT BEST. THIS MOVIE DID HOWEVER BREAK A FEW RECORDS FOR ME. 1. ITS SUPPOSED TO BE AN HOUR AND A HALF LONG-TIME STOPS OR MOVES VERY SLOWLY WHEN IN A THEATRE PLAYING THIS FILM. ITS SEEMED LIKE IT WAS AS LONG AS SCHINDLERS LIST, SERIOUSLY! I HAD TO CHECK THE TIME BECAUSE I SO WANTED IT TO FINISH, BUT IT DIDNT!!! PHYSICISTS SHOULD STUDY TIME IN RELATION TO THIS FILM!!!
2. IT WAS BY FAR THE MOST OVERLY RATED MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!IT IS NOT AN 8, NO WAY IN HELL! THE AVG IQ OF PPL GIVING THIS FILM AN 8 OR ABOVE IS LIKE 50! HAS TO BE.I NO LONGER TRUST IMDB RATINGS AS A RESULT, BUT ROTTEN HAS THIS FILM AT 99%, MEANING ROTTEN REVEIWERS AVG IQ HAS GOT TO BE 18. LIKE ARE PPL RETARDED NOWADAYS OR WAS THIS RATING MANIPULATED BY PPL CLOSE TO THE FILM????"
146,Lady Bird,2,1 January 2018,Very overrated movie,"Young Ronan is a promissing actress and that's probably the only good thing about this movie. It's ratings are overinflated. Imdb ratings are becoming less and less relevant, sadly."
147,Lady Bird,3,31 December 2017,"Three Stars, Three Jokes.","Don't get me wrong i was really excited about this movie!So i sat down and i said to myself ""Let's just give this movie a chance, maybe it will be a hidden gem"". 
Inb4 i'm sitting there watching a re-run of every other teen high school/will you go to the prom with me- type of movie. No offence, but it was really underwhelming.The only actual funny scene in this movie was when she jumped out of her mothers car (which is also surprisingly in the trailer on Youtube) and nothing else. There was also a one liner-racist joke that she pulled on her brother and that was it. Oh and yeah let's make it even more anti-climatic and make her boyfriend gay because that hasn't been done before.""My name is ""Lady Bird"" not Christine....in the words of Jenna Walton (Odeya Rush)....""weird"".""But it's a coming of age movie""--No ma'am, it's not! If you do want to watch a coming of age movie, go watch ""The Breakfast Club"" or something.I don't get the ratings on this movie.Watch an hour long version of the movie trailer, it's wayyyy better, trust me."
148,Lady Bird,1,30 December 2017,missed the mark,"I don't understand the rave reviews. This movie had no real story line and the ending left us saying ""that's it"". It was not put together well. The story felt forced. It was typical ""Hollywood"" with high school sex, booze and weed as the story line mixed in with negativity, entitlement and strife. There was no climax to the story. It was not a 10, IMO. It wasn't even a 1."
149,Lady Bird,1,8 January 2018,Boring..,"In the early 2000s, an artistically-inclined seventeen year-old comes of age in Sacramento, California. Lady Bird is another overrated Oscar film that packs no emotion or heart from start to finish and has some great actors in it that don't even try at all. (0/10)"
150,Lady Bird,5,17 December 2017,Seen it already,"As a general rule, I don't care for coming-of-age movies. Having already done that myself, I find little reason to pay to do it again. However, led by the reviews of Lady Bird, the fine actresses Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan, and the charm of writer/director Greta Gerwig, I took a shot. I should have waited for it to play on cable. I've seen this film before. You've seen this film before. Pretty much anyone who saw Ghost World or Juno or Thirteen has seen this movie: rebellious daughter fights with her mom, Take 30. Ronan and Metcalf are fine. Gerwig handles her material and cast professionally, though with the actors she assembled that's hardly a surprise. The cinematography is dull and a little under-lit, though, which leaves the film with an overall bland, generic look. There are a few bright scenes scattered throughout the film, particularly towards the end. But overall, it's not a terribly interesting movie."
151,Lady Bird,2,9 January 2018,Another Annoying Talented Female Teenager - YAAAAWN,"Feminism and anti-white male prejudice all wrapped up in the one movie. Reviews: ""Oh I am so into this - this is/was me and I love it (me)."" Except for the very talented bit - probably true for most.Ok - it is clear I am over all the ""young female breaks stereotype and saves the world/family' movies. But please - will they stop anytime soon?? When are we going to have another As Good As It Gets - or is this now as good as it gets? Either this drivel or CGI drivel about male superheroes - is that it?? Do they realise the total movie audiences are more than just female teenagers (and male teenagers willing to go along for the obvious reason). Come on Hollywood lets get back to real movies and real things.End of rant - feel better now :)"
152,Lady Bird,1,31 December 2017,One of the worst U.S. movie I have even seen,"This film can be made by anyone.
The story is lame, the characters are just ordinary people,
Watching this movie is the most depressing thing I have ever done during 2017, and a worthless one, too. 
If I can get a refund of the movie based of the experience, I will."
153,Lady Bird,9,10 December 2017,Almost Awesome,"Great, engaging story, but the mother is such an overcritical stereotype that she is not credible as a character, and everyone's tolerance of her is not credible either. In normal life, someone would kill that bi-ch. Still Saorise Ronan is plugging again for her second Oscar, and could get it here. I can see her winning two or three in her lifetime.I felt connected to the movie, but not enveloped by it as I expected after seeing its unanimous rating as excellent. Somehow, I think its not headed for best picture.But, it certainly doesn't have to be. It's probably the best picture I've seen so far in this lackluster Christmas season (Dec 9, 2017.) I'm still looking for one that ""makes my year."""
154,Lady Bird,3,10 January 2018,Don't know what the fuss was about.,"I watched this movie because of all the fuss that was being made on Youtube reviews and word of mouth. I had a problem with a 23 year old woman playing a 17 year old high school student. I have enjoyed her work in some of her other movies, Hanna, The Host, and Byzantium. I guess knowing her work and how old she is, didn't allow me to accept her as a 17 year old high school student. The story was very basic about a teenage girl and her mother not getting along, which seems normal enough. These two just seemed to do everything wrong. Despite all that she did wrong, somehow she still ended up in a New York college. I think you should watch it and form your own opinion. I was barely able to get through it. I was watching it in my living room, so I couldn't walk out on it. I was able to make dinner and hit the restroom a couple of times without hitting the pause button."
155,Lady Bird,6,7 January 2018,Good acting carries a mediocre movie,"While the performances of Ronan and Metcalf were very good and the mother/daughter relationship was decently explored, the plot and themes fell short and prevented it from being enjoyable to watch. Many of the character and relationship arcs, such as Lady Bird and Kyle or Jenna or her best friend, were extremely predictable and flat, showing no nuance or multidimensionality. Themes like religion were attempted to be explored but weren't really, and many of the key moments seemed sloppily and not tactfully done, of which the bathroom scene is a prime example. All in all, not a bad movie by any means, but also not one which I found enjoyable to watch and one which I am not left with much to ponder beyond generic and simplistic ideas of mother/daughter love/hate relationships, struggles in exploring sexuality, social pressures in high school, and so on."
156,Lady Bird,5,28 December 2017,i'm gonna be brief with this,"I do like Saoirse Ronan a lot,... so i opted to sit through this. but what a slow and boring story. i'm sure anyone can dig up some teenage memories and beat this by a mile. in a film where Ronan had to carry most of the load on her own she did just ok, portraying quite an average (by all means) character trying to break free of her Catholic Sacramento background. on odds with her mother, regrets and predictable ending. why the hype about this film, - i really don't know. personally, i think she looked just great in How I Live now in a more compelling and moving story. this was average"
157,Lady Bird,1,8 January 2018,Wouldn't Pay for This,"I would see the movie, but I don't patronize movies made by anti-semites (Gerwig)"
158,Lady Bird,5,29 December 2017,"undeniably a 'good' film, but my god it's boring","Well made, well acted, well written, believable, real, etc, etc, but slow and boring.
 I would love to have been able to rate this higher, but quite frankly i couldn't wait for it to end (also absolutely not a comedy as listed)."
159,Lady Bird,9,9 December 2017,Almost Awesome,"Great, engaging story, but the mother is such an overcritical stereotype that she is not credible as a character, and everyone's tolerance of her is not credible either.

I'm still looking for one that ""makes my year."""
160,Lady Bird,8,25 November 2017,Very Good ...... Not Great,"A perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes says something. Maybe something more about ourselves than the movie itself. Lady Bird is a charming, engrossing, well-written and acted film. Greta Gerwig would have to concede that her movie breaks no new ground though it certainly covers excellently a niche within a genre; i.e., American high school coming- of-age, as well or better than most. Especially the mother/daughter relationship; e.g., Laurie Metcalf's airport circle cry could jerk tears out of a crash dummy. But the RT hype tells us we are so starved for quality with the state of multiplex fare that we'll elevate a fine take on a tried-and-true vehicle to Citizen Kane status. Call me a snob if you will. I wholly expect and maybe deserve ""2 out of 50 liked this COMMENT"" feedback. But I'm not trying to draw attention to myself or play the devil's advocate. Everyone loved Lady Bird and I had a nice time with it. However, after the tears dry and the gushing ends, it's just a nice movie."
161,Lady Bird,7,27 November 2017,Some geezer dude such as Billy Joel used to sing a ditty . . .,". . . about ""only the good die young,"" which seems to be an undercurrent of LADY BIRD. Carefully marketed to fit with concurrent release LBJ, LADY BIRD is bound to disappoint because it omits the JFK death scene. In fact, it seems that virtually no one dies during LADY BIRD, whether young or old, good or otherwise. Back in the days when many if not most Americans paid their bills by snail mail, the original LADY BIRD got her mug on a set of postage stamps for chopping down highway billboards or something. LADY BIRD tries very hard to be equally subversive, showing young Catholic girls munching on The Holy Host (aka Communion Wafers) while sharing tips on the best way to masturbate in the shower or bathtub. But no one's head does a 360 here, so this is definitely not your granddad's EXORCIST. Instead, LADY BIRD is set in Today's LBGT-Q World, where the New York City Universities are still empty because no one wants to step-on-a-crack, and have a Windows on the World busboy fall on them to break-their-back. It's not so much outtakes from RENT as it is another brick in the wall of bologna writer\director Greta Gerwig has been churning out as a career-long obsession with the art house sausage factory's meat-grinder of low-budget chick flicks."
162,Lady Bird,7,3 January 2018,"I did not find this masterpiece, but the quality of performance is undeniable, good film.","Lady Bird recently made history as Rotten Tomatoes' most highly rated film (which was lost shortly after and came back to Toy Story 2 and has a very positive rating on Metacritic which is 94, I admit I did not find this masterpiece that the criticism found, is a good movie, but I found it slow and did not see so much originality too, reminiscent of Boyhood for example, the plot he is good, but it is nothing impressive, but the performances are above average, Saiorse Ronan every time Laurie Metcalf is great in the film, and the rest of the cast in my opinion is fine, but not as well as the two mentioned, and Greta Gerwid does. a great directorial debut, does a great job, but her direction is not something to win the Oscar, because it's not a difficult direction, it's not hard to imagine Lady Bird being run by another director or director, but it was an excellent I start and hope to see m Her movies, is Lady Bird good? Is it a masterpiece? in my opinion no, it's a good movie, but I can not see the movie winning so many prizes in oscar in main categories, maybe in best actress for Saiorse Ronan but just that. Note 7.7"
163,Lady Bird,4,1 January 2018,Not much to be seen here,"This movie is average at best. The story is full of cliches and the characters are not very interesting; they try very hard to make them pass as quirky but it feels fake (the ""emo"" brother with piercing that never smile, the ""tortured"" musician, c'mon). This is a normal man idea of an indie movie.The production is alright and the acting is good, but that doesn't save the movie from mediocrity."
164,Lady Bird,8,31 December 2017,solid filmmaking,"This is a coming of age tale. A Good film. Not great, like Linklater or Baumbach, but very good. I like the steadiness of this film. Gerwig resists being melodramatic or tacky and reaps rewards for her focus. Metcalf is excellent as always and the young actress is quite wonderful."
165,Lady Bird,7,26 December 2017,An honest coming of age film but no classic,"A very honest and realistic coming of age film. Lady Bird portrays the confusion and self-discovery of the teenage years which is also affected by the class difference in the life of a high school student. Saoirse Ronan looks like a real teenager going through all these instead of looking like a supermodel which many such films opt to do. However, it can't be said that there was anything that hasn't been shown before that was here or there was anything exceptional in filmmaking techniques. Even though a very good film it's no instant classic as many claims it to be."
166,Lady Bird,6,14 December 2017,A misfire for me,"I have come around to appreciating why Sacramento-native Greta Gerwig considers Lady Bird a ""love letter"" to her city. It's the best thing I can say for it. The movie is bookended very satisfactorily with an opening scene that sets just the right tone and the protagonist's change of heart regarding her hometown of Sacramento. The in-between parts are where I found the protagonist disappointingly uninteresting and the messaging ham-handed as it related to her. It has been heralded as a highly intelligent coming-of-age story, but I can't help but disagree. Saoirse Ronan plays Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson by making believe that she isn't absolutely gorgeous. She also insists on going to an East Coast liberal arts school despite apparently being divested of such aptitudes. Although she understandably yearns to escape her Central Valley life and does undergo a character arc that I cannot in good conscience mock, her eyebrow-raising indulgences breathe a little life into a story mired by her uninspiring, self-centered mentality. Had she been more principled and dignified, vowing to reimburse her parents the cost of raising her could have been more than erratic foolishness, however ill-advised it would still have been. The same goes for her bail out from the car (my favorite scene, nonetheless). Christine's eccentricities and the mother-daughter relationship strain credulity a little, but not too much. She is for me a character to be endured, not enjoyed, and ditto for her mother, and while I am at it, her adopted brother. Christine's friendship with the comparatively charming Julie has a ring of contrivance given the former's character flaws. The conceited Jenna is authentically disagreeable. Christine's even-keeled father is a refreshing opposite to her melodramatic, despairing mother. The first boyfriend (played by Lucas Hedges of the brilliant Manchester by the Sea) is indeed tolerable compared to boyfriend number two, a moron with a lot of screen time. The third guy only had to be an upfront atheist for our rebellious Catholic Schoolgirl (if he had to be anything). She tells him, ""People go by the names their parents give them, but they don't believe in God."" A banal remark, if you ask me. And she makes my point for me by later dropping ""Lady Bird"" for her parents' answering machine. It surely can be argued that a movie shouldn't be too aware of when it takes place, but the predictable indications--Iraq War coverage (watched by teenagers, no less) and talk of cell phones being ubiquitous in the near future--are easily forgiven and on some level wanted. I liked the crying game and the football coach turned theater director scene. The parent-child open house outing is something I can relate to from my own childhood. Writing this review elevated my opinion of Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird somewhat. That is to say, my mind is less boggled by the critical acclaim. It ultimately deals with interesting aspects of life, just not as I would like it to, and the lovable deviant vibe simply hasn't come over me."
167,Lady Bird,7,8 December 2017,"Like last year's ""La La Land"", very good but overrated","This realistic coming of age story and ode - of all places - Sacramento, California brings an economic and family relational honesty largely missing from Hollywood movies. The biggest achievement of the movie is getting something original and human released by the modern film business. Having made that familiar complaint, likely the international grosses will be paltry - not sure Bejing movie ticket buyers will get many of the Central California references. Domestic audiences will leave with a similar reaction after viewing last year's ""La La Land"" - ""it was very good but not as incredible you hear"". Saoirse Ronan will land a well-deserved Oscar nom for her lead performance. This will cement TheWestchestarian's reputation for pop culture soothsaying given the prediction made in a review of Peter Jackson's awful ""The Lovely Bones"" on the eventual stardom Ronan would achieve based on her first movie."
168,Lady Bird,8,29 November 2017,Mother vs. Daughter,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 stars) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A good (not great) film with sensitive direction and two wonderful performances to enjoy.SYNOPSIS: A coming of age story with mother-daughter issues.JIM'S REVIEW: The volatile relationship between parent and child has been a popular subject in the arts. That unpredictable bonding between father and son or mother and daughter makes for an interesting combination. The latter is on display in Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig's engrossing character study of a young girl's flight of fantasy or her flight away from a domineering mother.￼Set in 2002, a.k.a. Christine McPherson (a.k.a. Lady Bird) is in her final year of high school, eager to shake off her town and family and fly east to New York City to make her dreams come true. Ashamed of her middle class upbringing, she is eager to fly the coop. Her father, Larry, is so mild-mannered that he is basically ignored by his loved ones as he negotiates the war between the women in his household. Her mother, Marion, is not the nurturing type and her actions are second place to her verbal assaults. Far from encouraging, she would rather have her idealistic daughter view life in realistic terms, another words, accept the sadness of it all. So Lady Bird has no other choice but to rebel against her parents, friends, and her rigid Catholic School regime, all of which are trying to hold her back from her own experimental impulses.￼This set-up is all too familiar territory, but as the director, Ms. Gerwig captures the awkwardness of adolescence and that hormonal imbalance that signifies innocence and self- importance. Her observational glimpses into first love (and that first real kiss), teenage authority issues, and peer pressure are spot-on. The predictability factor is still there, and some scenes go on a bit long, but there are also some surprising events added to the drama about working class economic struggle that are quite telling and unusual for this genre.￼As the screenwriter, Ms. Gerwig is mostly successful. Script-wise, this coming of age tale wanders and loses focus with its plotting and the sketchiness of its minor characters, most of which remain interesting, but underdeveloped. Their fates seem to get lost in the storytelling. Yet, at the film's core is the effective mother and daughter tag team bout that makes this film so special. These two characters are rich in details and depth. Their dialog sounds refreshingly honest and natural and the two actresses excel in making their mercurial relationship utterly convincing.￼Saoirse Ronan in the title role delivers a fully realized portrayal of a teenager holding onto her dreams and defiantly expressing her independence. This talented actress plays her eccentric character as one part exasperating and and two parts enchanting. Her excellent performance is matched by Laurie Metcalf's sharp tongued and distraught matriarch. As Marion, her verbal reactions hide the love for her daughter and watching the actress' subtle expressions after words are cruelly and hastily spoken brings the necessary depth that prevent her from becoming a monster. (The film's most memorable and bittersweet scene involves an uncomfortable conversation in which Lady Bird simply asks her mother if she likes her, preceded by a hesitated and jumbled answer. That delayed response says much about the sensitive writing and nuanced acting in this film.)￼Tracy Letts is Lady Bird's understanding father and peacemaker of the family and he creates a strong character in this meek ordinary man. Also notable are Lucas Hedges as Lady Bird's first love and Beanie Feldstein as her loyal sidekick. The always dependable Lois Smith and Stephen McKinley Henderson deliver short but noteworthy moments in their smaller roles.Ms. Gerwig has directed her film with a deft vision, even if her screenplay could use more cohesion. Still, Lady Bird is fast becoming a darling of the critics and their many accolades seem slightly overdone. It is a good, but far from great, film...with great, not just good, performances by its female leads...and well worth seeing."
