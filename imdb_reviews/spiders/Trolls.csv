0,Trolls,,20 February 2017,My son loved it...its a kid's movie!,"After seeing so many negative ""trolls"" on here about what people don't like about this film, I thought I would just throw one glaring fact out there...it's a movie for kids! And my 2.5 year old loved it! As far as he is concerned, it currently has infinite replay value. He really seems to like movies that have a great sound track...which this one does. The songs are enjoyable covers of easily recognizable pop songs from several decades, with some modified lyrics. The point is, if a film entertains your kid many times over, then the writers did something right. The plot was simple and was about what I expected. If you really hated this movie, stop being such a Bergen and lighten up!"
1,Trolls,9,6 January 2017,"Love the positive vibes and creative, colorful animation! Instant good mood!","I'm a 30 year old man, so probably not what the producers envisioned as their primary market, but I still love this movie!Being a raver at heart, it's fun to watch these troll live in the ultimate psychedelic fantasy. With non-stop music, dancing, hugs, and trippy hairdos, these Trolls know how to keep it PLUR! I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but this movie has a nice variety of songs and keeps them short, fun, and too the point. Never a moment to get bored. Most of the songs are very clich√©, generic, pop songs, but they are catchy and upbeat, so it's hard to complain.Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake have great chemistry and put a lot of personality into the characters. I think they nailed it.I feel like the team that made this movie did a great job collaborating between the writing, acting, and animation to create lots of really great moments for characters that a truly hilarious. Unlike most comedies, this one seems to get funnier each time I watch it. I can't get enough of the fun characters and find myself smiling throughout the day thinking of the great moments in this film.Creative musical numbers like ""Sounds of Darkness"" perfectly complement hilarious comedy scenes like the encounter with M. Cloud, and lead me to believe that the guys who directed this movie have a lot of talent. I'm surprised this film doesn't have a higher rating. I really can't think of what is not to like, but I'm guessing it's just one of those things where you either love it or hate it. I can see it becoming somewhat of a cult classic. I really hope it made enough money that we will get to see a sequel!"
2,Trolls,7,18 February 2017,I have to confess I really enjoyed it!,I expected this to be another identikit kids animated movie like we've seen so many times before over the years. You know....typical cash in on a franchise or trend doing the rounds at that time.However I will admit I really did enjoy this movie. It has some great music in it. Some unexpected (and great!) 80s covers included throughout and overall it did have some great dialogue and funny little moments mixed in there.Yeah so the story is pretty predictable but the voice talent and the animation carries it off so well you don't mind so much.Its not gonna win any awards but there are worse ways to spend an afternoon with your kids.
3,Trolls,10,6 March 2017,Family fun,"Keep in mind, this is a movie intended for kids!!! If you find singing in movies annoying, this isn't for you, but kids love it for the most part. I know mine did and I even liked it. Perfect for family night, if you are old school like I am. It is a refreshing tale of semi unique features that teaches courage, kindness and that its okay to be you. Very family friendly, cute and sparkly!"
4,Trolls,7,16 October 2016,"Kids will eat it up, Grownups have seen it one too many times","I took my 5 1/2 year old daughter to watch Trolls, and for her it was a sight for sore eyes. The main character, Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick) is a fluffy, instantly lovable princess troll, who has been raised in a careless, yet slightly obnoxious, world - where everyone hugs each other on an hourly basis, poops cupcakes and bursts into sappy pop tunes in the blink of the eye. Her male counterpart, on the other hand, is all doom and gloom. This troll party pooper, named Branch and colored gray to differentiate him from the endlessly colorful group of merry trolls, keeps warning his friends that their loud lifestyle will put their lives in jeopardy, once the evil Bergens, who are only happy when they eat the tiny little Trolls, will take notice of them. Sure enough, this does happen pretty soon into the movie, and when several Trolls are taken - Poppy and Branch (who refuses to sing throughout the film, even though he is ironically voiced by Justin Timberlake) need to join forces in order to save them.All in all, Trolls is a very cute film. It stands out of the pack with its familiar setting (the Troll toys have been very popular ever since the early 90's), its rich palette of colors and imaginative drawings, and the catchy tunes which are cleverly adapted into the film. Also, its short run-time will make sure your kids are glues to the chair. On the flip side, I felt the plot didn't really offer anything new, the proceedings were predictable from miles away, and that it lacked a stronger emotional pull that could have left a longer impression. There was some stuff in the movie that seemed like it was trying a bit too hard to be tongue-in- cheek, without really taking itself seriously, and while it gave way to a few laughs, it left me wanting something more than just another cute animated feature."
5,Trolls,10,15 October 2016,"A cute, colorful, funny and heartwarming adventure you will definitely enjoy!","At first I had pretty low expectations for this film because of its first teaser, but then the first full length trailer made me look forward to it, and now that I've seen it, I have to say, you will enjoy this once you see it. It's very vibrant and filled with colour, which makes for a bright and exciting time, the trolls themselves are all really cute and colorful, and they are usually really funny in a situation and they are always positive and full of hope. It has a very well thought storyline, even if it does sound a bit generic at first, but it feels new and so fresh and original when you see it. And there is a lot of signing and dancing, and a lot of musical cues, and the songs really do get to you, as they are very catchy. And at times this film is very heartwarming, and a bit emotional at places, but that's sort of what you'd expect from a film like this. So overall, definitely see this one, as it is a cute, colorful, funny and heartwarming adventure that the whole family will enjoy!"
6,Trolls,7,25 February 2017,fun silly movie,"yes, this is a movie for young viewers, but it is fun. silliness and a simple story. but frankly we don't have enough of them in this movie era. the colors are great, the animation is fun and frankly as an adult, i did enjoy it. this movie is pure escape. it is fun to hear the voices of such esteemed actors playing such fun characters. Sometimes i think so many reviewers feel they must pan movies as they don't relay various critical standards.. However, this one isn't one. i like many types of movies and this is one of them. a purely fun and colorful take on things. enjoy it for what it is and don't over think it! not all movies need that. it is great for kids and adults if you look at it as being simply fun! i am well over 21 and liked it very much!"
7,Trolls,10,7 March 2017,Great Beyond Any Expectations!!,"After the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy, the happiest Troll ever born, and the curmudgeonly Branch set off on a journey to rescue her friends. When i watched the first trailer for 'Trolls' i didn't know what to expect but i'm happy to announce that the 6.5 rating here in IMDb is a big joke because this film was insane and all the songs were pretty amazing especially 'Can't Stop the Feeling' was the best of them all. Plus the voice casting was pretty spot on Anna Kendrick as Poppy was excellent, Justin Timberlake plays a troll called Branch that doesn't like singing and Zooey Deschanel as Bridget was easily my favorite part of the entire thing plus the ending of the movie was pretty great and with some pretty good messages for both kids and adults about what true happiness feels like. So overall let's bring on Trolls 2 now!!!"
8,Trolls,10,3 January 2017,This movie made me happy,"No really, it did. I couldn't believe how nice this movie made me feel as I was watching it. The story is a pretty standard hero's journey, but with the evil trolls or grendels or whatever eating happy trolls to get happy themselves. It seemed a little dark at first, but everything works out in the end of course, as this is a kids movie. It shows good and bad in equal measure, which I believe is how we should educate kids, not keep them in a bubble. The lessons it teaches are actually nice, don't give up, persevere, happiness is within. The boy troll (Timberlake) is so funny, especially in the beginning. Anna Kendrick is hilarious with snappy dialogue. The songs are a bit old fashioned, the fact that the writer is nostalgic really stands out. But they fit the story, rather than being just music breaks, so it's good."
9,Trolls,8,12 March 2017,It's a great movie for everyone,"I've read some reviews and to be honest some take this movie WAY TOO FAR and it's not a fair review for what is a really good movie for your family and/or children to really enjoy. As far as some characters that people can ""relate to"" in a kids movie and making a review comparing them to themselves and their life and how a certain character sends a wrong message is absurd and a little too much. THIS IS A KIDS MOVIE!! It doesn't send any bad messages whatsoever. My 5 year old loves it and I do too really. It's very funny, has good music, characters are unique and colorful. Only thing negative is the darkness in some of the Bergens and that they remind me of the movie Boxtrolls which I couldn't stand. But, they don't ruin the movie at all and I can live with most of them. Anna Kendrick can really sing and I had no idea she had that in her and of course Timberlake was great. I highly recommend this movie! In no way does it deserve anything under a 7/10!"
10,Trolls,2,15 December 2016,"Will keep kids entertained, but grown-ups with critical capabilities will probably despise it","I very firmly believe that Trolls is the summation of cinematic garbage. It is only for one specific reason that I give this ""movie"" more than 1 star, and that is because it will most likely entertain your children. Where to even begin? At the beginning we are introduced to the main antagonists, the Bergens. It is rather unfortunate that most of the Bergens are more fleshed out than the main characters. Who are the main characters, you may ask? The titular Trolls. The Trolls can hardly even be called characters. None of them have any personalities, and I could just barely tell them apart from each other by their physical traits. There was ONE character I did not despise at the beginning, the character of Branch, a Troll who refuses to be happy like the rest of the village. This character was the only thing keeping me from falling asleep and completely despising this movie. However, he eventually is given a sob-story background, and becomes yet another of the cookie-cutter personalities infesting this picture like lice. In addition, the script is awful and generic, and the film cannot even decide what tone it wishes to take. Finally, my biggest gripe is that the Trolls are basically invincible. They are a community of Mary Sues and Gary Stus, who cannot seem to ever be harmed, even if they are repeatedly attacked. How did Dreamworks expect audiences to be emotionally invested in the narrative, when the main ""characters"" are never in any danger? I cannot recommend this movie, unless you wish to entertain your children for a short while."
11,Trolls,3,27 November 2016,Like a VERY long Disney Chanel music video,"As parents we expect most movies we take our kids to, to be more for them and feel lucky if we get a few laughs. Trolls disappoints even mediocre expectations. It's totally reliant on colors, noises, and the singing voices of the lead characters. Many movies have adult jokes which children don't need to hear. This one has them, except they are not funny. The adults in the theater with me laughed at maybe 1/20 adult jokes. My son in the 7- 10 yr old range did say he really liked it, but when I asked him why his response was, ""I liked how everyone was happy,"" and ""the trolls."" The moral takeaway that was slightly present was lost in the pop. There are plenty of kids' movies that the whole family can be entertained and even moved by. Skip this one."
12,Trolls,2,4 February 2017,Terrible plot and message for kids,"This is going to be my first review, I reopened my account just for this. I must say that I am disgusted by the terrible message this movie gives off for young insecure and impressionable people. I had a really nice time with the movie for a while, but only because I could relate heavily to the slightly pessimistic lone wolf troll called Branch. It was such a nice breath of fresh air to see a character not being ""perfect"" according to society's norms these days. Branch is a loner who seems to be at his best when enjoying his own company, he is organized and he has made an effort to stockpile resources for the future years, while all the other trolls just partied and socialized until it became their downfall. This movie is an introvert's nightmare. It quickly becomes clear they wanted to portray that it is not okay for branch to not want to party and socialize all the time, he is presented as weird and none of the other trolls really want to interact with Branch because he is not like them. I wanted to be sick, when I realized that Branch had to have a tragic background story to be the cause of his ""terrible and wrong"" personality. People are not all the same. There are optimists and pessimists, extroverts and introverts, good days and bad days. Portraying that the only right way to be, is to be outgoing, social, physical and to party all day long, could easily make kids feel even more pressure to be perfect according to society. Like there isn't enough pressure from the rest of the entertainment industry on kids already. Kids are already bombarded through music lyrics and videos and through social media. This movie should have celebrated diversity and realized that there are many ways to be happy and to enjoy life. Beside the message that diversity is wrong and that you all must be mindless indoctrinated dancing candy floss puppets, the movie had an extremely weak plot. The unhappy Bergen want to eat the trolls in order to find happiness (very not so subtle metaphor for us that antidepressants and other addictive substances are bad for you and wont give you true happiness, as we know, dancing singing and socializing is the only way for one to achieve that), trolls get snatched and brought to Bergen town cause of their careless nature. Remaining trolls eat all of Branch's stockpile of food in his secret bunker and do nothing. Branch and Poppy go to Bergen town and rescue the kidnapped trolls and of course implement their propaganda upon the inhabitants, freeing them from their chains of despair through dancing. Oh, and Branch becomes like all the other trolls ¬ñ ""One of us, one of us, one of us"", *creepy brainwashed stare*I would recommend The Lion King if you want to learn a thing or two about life, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs if you enjoy movies containing characters with different personalities (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey).2/10 for the visuals."
13,Trolls,4,14 December 2016,Sparkly Kids movie,"This movie is great for 5 yo girls. They'll love the abundant color, sparkles and soundtrack. Boys - not so much. My 9yo and his friend were squirming in their seats after the first 10 minutes, but the 7yo sister was entertained. Adults - well if you can drink a beer/wine or pass out until the end, this would be advisable - otherwise just shoot me.The story line is the usual predictable, overdone Cinderella story. The premise of cannibalistic Bergens who can only attain happiness at another's expense, is a little disturbing. However, this is squarely for the young kiddos - I suppose most will enjoy it.4/10."
14,Trolls,10,31 October 2016,Fun! fun! fun !,"Fun! fun! fun !Is that kind of movie that will take out the kid in you, no mater how deep you hide it! Trolls just proves that we all have a kid in us, and it's nothing wrong to let him out¬† every now and then. The mix off colors, the jokes and the fun music will light your face. By the half of the movie,all you want to do it's singing and dancing.¬† Moddy or happy, we all know that it's a very healthy expression. I strongly recommend Trolls, not just for kids but for the whole family. ¬†You know that day that you are not in mood for anything? I mean anything! That day that you are a step a way to put a sign on your head with: "" out of service "" so people will live you alone, this is a day to see Trolls!¬† I promise this movie will¬† put a huge smile all over your face."
15,Trolls,10,16 October 2016,Sprinkling Happiness at a Theater Near You!,"Trolls is one of those animated features you may think you've seen already, and don't want to see again...but, hold on; it's funny. If you can hark back to your own childhood, you'll remember this, and want to find a piece of it again. Releasing it at the start of the holiday season is a smart box office move, but if families actually take their children, a good time will be had by all. I promise you'll be happily humming this soundtrack for days before you break down and buy it because, well, you liked the songs, too. They won't drive you nuts like some purple dinosaur music you may recall with disdain, and you may find them creeping up on your own ""most played"" list.The story is good, with relatable characters and situations, and some you'll be thankful can't happen in real life. Yes, there is bathroom humor. Get over it. Kids love it. Children have so little actual power, living vicariously through the antics of Branch (aptly voiced by Justin Timberlake) is the least you can allow. His singing, along with Gwen Stefani and the others make this musical journey a joy to behold, and one you'll want to see on the big screen with the whole family."
16,Trolls,10,15 October 2016,I am so HAPPY now I've seen Trolls,"I just loved it, and the kids just loved it too! My boys (4 and 2) watched with smiles on their faces and even bopped along to the soundtrack which just spills over with happy, uplifting songs. All of which are sung beautifully. The story has a real moral without it being overpowering or boring for the kids. We can all learn something from these adorable little dudes, and of course Briget, the Bergen who dares to believe in happiness!It's fun, glittery, happy and full of singing, dancing, love, big rainbow hair, and just general joy.If you don't love it, you need to look harder for your happiness, it's in us all somewhere y'know üòò"
17,Trolls,9,11 February 2017,A Bombardment of Pure Joy and Happiness,"I don't know what's wrong with those people who gave this movie a rating below 7, but they definitely need professional help. Cause if you don't feel that this movie is great, then there must be something really broken inside you! This movie gave us nothing but beautiful music, great adventures, hilarious comedy, with a little hint of fairy tale inserted (Hello, Cinderella!). It also gave us a strong moral lesson, which is to never give up hope in any kind of bad situation. It also tell us to be brave, kind, and always try to see the bright side in everything. How can it be called anything except amazing? I'm a guy, but I'm deeply touched when I saw Poppy's sadness killing her happiness, turning her whole body grey but then Branch started healing her and reviving her colors back. I have to admit I cried when I witnessed that heartwarming event. The songs which were picked for this movie is spot on! Each and every one of them brushed this movie with joy, thrill, and spirit. This animation movie is nearly perfect in every aspect. If you want to feel happy, then you definitely need to watch this movie."
18,Trolls,3,26 November 2016,Lazy Animation Combined with Old Hit Remarketing,"3.2 of 10. If you're choosing which theater cartoon to see with kids this holiday, Moana is the clear and easy winner. Trolls is a lazy cartoon from beginning to end. From the low-quality of the animation itself to the story and music selection, there's is nothing innovative, ambitious, or worth viewing on anything other than free TV, and only then to keep the kids quiet and out of trouble.The 1 redeeming quality in the story is that it's about happiness not being found/gained through consumption, but instead through hugs and friends.As for the cartoon quality, you see much better in TV standards for kids like Spongebob Squarepants and Adventure Time. The music and audio in them is also surprisingly better. The music you get in this is a selection of 80s/90s pop hits that you hear/have heard far more than you want to already. Nothing original.Disappointing and cheaply done cartoon that provides nothing new. The very least they could have done is select some obscure or new music that fits in with the story, but they seem more interested in selling film space to existing corporate elevator music."
19,Trolls,9,16 October 2016,Incredibly cute with a delightful soundtrack,"Walt Dohrn and Mike Mitchell, the guys behind some of the Shrek franchise, bring Thomas Dan's iconic, legendary ""Good Luck Trolls"" to life. The plastic figurines with vibrant, up-combed hair. In 2010, DreamWorks Animation announced they were going to make a feature length movie and then eventually bought the brand outright back in 2013. All the trolls party happily in the sanctuary of the woods, far away from the miserable, troll- eating Bergens, who twenty years previously had attempted to feast on the go-lucky trolls to bring them happiness. However, the trolls' loud partying puts a spotlight on their camp resulting in few being captured ensuring a daring, rescue mission. Anna Kendrick who's a movie star that can sing superbly, already known for her vocal talents in Into The Woods and Pitch Perfect, plays Poppy, the over-positive, highly-excitable and super- enthusiastic Troll princess that enjoys loud parties, dancing, singing, hugging and scrapbooking, leads the rescue party with the reluctant, over-paranoid, highly-negative and super-gloomy Troll, Branch. Branch, played by Superstar singer-come-actor Justin Timberlake. You think you know a voice until the see the credits of an animated movie as it's surprising to hear the all-star cast including Zooey Deschanel, Russell Brand, James Cordon, Gwen Stefani and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. All giving great voice performances that capture each characters personality. On top of the vivid, ultra-colourful animation, there's the catchy soundtrack that comes with it. Being a musical it's packed with recognisable yet fresh songs that gives a contagious vibe like no other. The songs hit home each time, whether it be for comic effect, emotional sadness or joyful, feel-goodness. My God-Daughter was dancing away at the end and no-one was immune to a little bopping. There's a good moral story behind Trolls, involving the pursuit of happiness which is at times, a little sad and touching , but also uplifting and encouraging at the same time, it's especially tearful when you see some characters come out in their true colours. I actually can't stop listening to some of the soundtrack. It's not all out funny but the lack of comic value is balanced out with incredible cuteness and rapid interjections of silly, lovable characters. It's creative, original and wholly refreshing that's a colourful delight to watch. Never being an owner of a troll, but I actually want one now. Running Time: 9 The Cast: 8 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 7 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 just for True Colors and the rest of the soundtrack. Would I buy the Bluray?: Yes. 88% 9/10"
20,Trolls,7,24 December 2016,Trolls,"Trolls is exactly what I expected it to be, good lighthearted fun. The plot for the film is basic and very predictable but nothing really worth criticsing since at the end of the day, it's just a fun film that hopefully all the family can enjoy. At just over 80 minutes it passes a bit of time. The animation is superb, really nice to look at with lovely vibrant colours throughout the whole film. The songs were really catchy, some moments even made me laugh out loud but overall it was just one of them films that I happily sat and watched with a smile on my face. I like animated films but most of the recent ones just aren't very good so I'm pleased that I at least enjoyed this one. Also I don't do singing in films (can't stand Frozen) but this one wasn't a constant song fest.The voice actors were very good, although most of them were easily recognized without even looking at the cast list. Overall a solid first film in which is more than likely going to end up as a franchise. Worth checking out.7/10."
21,Trolls,5,26 November 2016,Good for kids,"I took my daughter to see it and I remembered when I had the toys. There wasn't a movie to go along with the dolls then, but they were so cute. It was a decent movie, but way too much singing. I know trolls are meant to be happy, but they sang too much. I felt they sang on every little thing they did. It is good for children because children like vivid colors and think the hair is cute. I did back then. I did like Branch because he saw what the other trolls did not see. The others let their guard down because they had years of being undisturbed by the bergens, but Branch was smarter. They learned a lesson from Branch and Branch learned something from them."
22,Trolls,8,16 November 2016,Trolls was a very enjoyable computer-animated musical!,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this DreamWorks Animation feature which is a musical with both original and familiar songs from decades past. Trolls is quite enjoyable about a group of happy-well, you know-who have to escape from a bunch of bigger monsters in order to survive as a species. There's also a somewhat Cinderella-like vibe involving a couple of those bigger characters. One of my favorite song performances involved the tune ""True Colors"" which me and my friend remembered being first recorded by Cyndi Lauper 30 years ago. Like most computer-animated movies we've seen in the last decade or so, Trolls is funny and touching in places. So on that note, that's a high recommendation!"
23,Trolls,8,23 October 2016,Colourful and upbeat confection that will especially delight the younger crowd,"Despite loving or really liking a good deal of DreamWorks' previous work, especially 'The Prince of Egypt' (for me their best to date and one of my favourite films, animated and ever) and 'How to Train Your Dragon' (also a favourite), expectations were low for 'Trolls'.That is partly because although there are some very good to outstanding DreamWorks films, there have been underwhelming efforts too like 'Shark Tale', 'Bee Movie' and 'Home', even thought the last two 'Shrek' films and 'Penguins of Madagascar' could have been better than they turned out. A larger part however was that the teaser looked dreadful and the first trailer only marginally better, so was expecting a bad film and very much a lesser effort.What a surprise. 'Trolls' is yet another classic victim of bad and misleading advertising/marketing, and it is a shame as for me it is one of DreamWorks' past decade or so efforts along with 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' and 'Kung Fu Panda 2'. That said, it is understandable as to why some will still not like it or find it entirely appealing to them. It is somewhat younger-crowd oriented, so older children and adults may find, and have found, it too cute, too hyper-active and too cloying for their tastebuds.As a young adult myself with there was a lot to like, with the colours, the music, the characters, energy and overall atmosphere more than compensating and almost masking a story that narratively and structurally is not really all that special. There isn't really anything new as such conceptually and not a lot done in bringing freshness to it, while the magical hair subplot did feel shoe-horned in and as a result of not being elaborated upon quite enough it doesn't make as much sense as it ought to have done.On the other hand, the animation is brilliant. There is so much imaginative detail, the characters are well modelled, the backgrounds meticulous and best of all the colours are gorgeously vibrant and leap out at you from the screen. The soundtrack is like a musical extravaganza, and an upbeat and infectious one that has a huge presence in the film without being overkill. The script is enough fun and wit to counter-balance the cuteness and sugar, and neither of these elements felt over-balanced personally but that is not going to be an opinion shared by everybody.Story-wise, that is where 'Trolls' is least successful. However the energy is exuberant, and personally just couldn't fail to be captivated by the energy, feel-good nature and charm that the film had, even if narratively it's not that strong the atmosphere certainly was. The characters were pretty adorable, none of them were annoying and none on the wrong side of sickly sweet. The voice acting all round is adept, and the singing showing the vocalists attacking the music with gusto and love of music.On the whole, colourful and upbeat confection that may be too cute and sugary for older audiences, though there will definitely be exceptions (being one), but will especially delight the younger crowd. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
24,Trolls,8,4 November 2016,Best Movie,"You know, when I first heard of this movie I groaned because I've always loathed those troll things, but then the trailer completely caught me off guard and now this is one of the animated movies I'm most excited for this year. Why? Considering the hideous troll dolls this was made after, this movie could SO easily have taken the Sony route and turned into another Smurfs or Alvin and the Chipmunks and brought the trolls to the real world, or maybe even taken the TMNT route and tried to turn them into hyper realistic creatures to fit into real life. Instead of doing either, DreamWorks actually set them up in an adorable world of their own, filled with plushie creatures, toys and glitter... and man this is creative as hell! Look at all the lovely designs for the creatures, not to mention the soft textures that make my hands itch to touch them. The animation looks fantastic and definitely caught my interest. I can't wait to see how they will play with such an interesting world gadecosmetics.se"
25,Trolls,9,6 November 2016,"""Trolls"" is a very enjoyable, kid-friendly, but derivative movie.","Before I start talking specifically about the animated fantasy comedy ""Trolls"" (PG, 1:32), I think I should define the kind of trolls that we're dealing with here. (You may be surprised and even entertained by learning how many different kinds of trolls there are ¬ñ and how we got to the 2016 big-screen version.) These are not the trolls that upset well-meaning people with ignorant, rude or otherwise inflammatory comments on the internet. These are also not the trolls of Scandinavian folklore, which were often portrayed as ugly, dimwitted and annoying or even dangerous to people. (But we are getting warmer.) The modern, friendlier version of the troll traces its origins to Danish fisherman and woodcutter Thomas Dam carving a troll doll for his daughter in 1959. Other local children wanted troll dolls too and Dam started a business producing his line of ""Good Luck Trolls"". Those Dam trolls became an international phenomenon. Cheap knock-offs of the doll hurt the troll brand, but the Dam family eventually regained complete control of the brand. In 2013, that same Dam family sold the international troll doll rights to DreamWorks Animation. In other words, the family of troll inventor Thomas Dam approves this movie.According to a voice-over (and scrapbooking images) at the beginning of the film, the colorful, high-haired so-ugly-that-they're-cute Trolls are a happy group who spend all of their time singing, dancing and hugging. (Awwww¬Ö) People say that happiness is contagious. If so, it can apparently also be ingested. The miserable ogre-like Bergen discover that if they eat trolls, they can be briefly happy, so they institute an annual troll-eating holiday called ""Trollstice"". (Factoid break: ""Bergen"" is the German word for ""mountains"" and, in European folklore, trolls were often depicted as mountain dwellers.) King Peppy (Jeffrey Tambor), leader of the Trolls, leads the little guys and gals in a daring escape from Bergen Town right before the annual Trollstice¬Ö and the Bergen are very upset to be missing out on their annual burst of happiness. King Gristle Sr. (John Cleese), ruler of the Bergen, is especially angry because this Trollstice was to be the first for his son, Prince Gristle Jr. (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). The King exiles Chef (Christine Baranski) for her failure to produce the annual Trollstice meal. Chef vows to find the Trolls, bring them back to Bergen Town and avenge her banishment. Then¬Ö twenty years pass.Princess Poppy (Anna Kendrick) becomes the de facto leader of the Trolls, her kindness, joy and activity planning being an example to all. All but one. A joyless, virtually colorless Troll named Branch (Justin Timberlake) refuses to join in any singing, dancing or hugging. He's kind of a ""Chicken Little"", constantly warning his fellow Trolls to tone down their activities or risk being found by the Bergen. When his worst fears become reality, Poppy manipulates Branch into coming with her to Bergen Town to help free several captured trolls ¬ñ and, later, to help out a lovelorn Bergen named Bridget (Zooey Deschanel).""Trolls"" is a very kid-friendly and enjoyable, but derivative movie. It seems influenced, to varying degrees, by ""The Smurfs"", ""Frozen"", ""Tangled"" and ""Cinderella"", but, hey, those ARE some very good influences and their combination here produces some quality entertainment. The animation is detailed and explodes with color, the plot's simple and engaging, the dialog is both fun and funny and the music (original songs, plus pop songs from the 60s through the 80s) are well-chosen and well-performed. The voice actors (also including Russell Brand, James Corden, Kunal Nayyar and Gwen Stefani) are great too.It's a great family movie (and the start of a franchise), but is clearly aimed at the little ones, with a high cuteness quotient and lessons about selflessness, loyalty and even a subtle anti-drug message (seen most clearly when Chef tries to maintain her power in Bergen Town by insisting that the Bergen continue to get happy ""my way"" ¬ñ by eating trolls ¬ñ even as the Trolls are trying to show the Bergen that they can find happiness in ways that are more natural and don't hurt anyone). Mostly, ""Trolls"" is simply a fun, feel-good movie¬Ö and sometimes the simplest pleasures are among the best ¬ñ as this one is. ""A-"""
26,Trolls,10,2 November 2016,Best Animated Movie of 2016 so far...,"Let me start with... ""I came out of the theater very happy."" When the trailer of this movie came out, I was really hooked into it already. When a new trailer came out featuring Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick, I was even more excited. And I am glad this movie didn't fail me. I would easily put this as ""The Best Animated Movie of the Year"", it have everything I wanted in an animated movie that was missing in ""Storks"", ""Finding Dory"" and other animated movies this year. Songs + Animation could never go wrong and always made for each other and the songs features in this movie are good songs with a twist. To name a few, ""Hello"" by Adele, ""Hello"" by Lionel Richie and my favorite part is ""True Colors"". But there's a lot more music in it that is why you have to watch it. I also love the values being put into the movie which is recommended for everyone. There's a lot of good lines in the movie and one of my favorites is ""I know life is not all rainbows and cupcakes. I know there are negative/bad things too. But I'd rather look at the world that way than looking at it in a negative way"". I just love the overflowing positivity, happiness and endless hugging and dancing in the movie. Another thing are the very funny jokes and punchlines in the movie. There is one specific scene there that made me laugh so damn hard. I just love this movie a lot and I want to watch it over and over again. Just amazing!"
27,Trolls,8,20 March 2017,loved it,"I took my 4 year old to the cinema to watch this. We laughed, we cried, we sang along, we bought the DVD and have watched it several times a day since. I'm still not bored of watching it. Christine Baranski is brilliant and worth watching it alone for. The rest of the cast is brilliant too. The music selection complements the action very well, and we had to get the soundtrack the moment we got home."
28,Trolls,8,19 February 2017,True happiness and sweet film for everyone,"I was very happy when I get to watch this. This has famous singers like Icona Pop,Gwen Stefani, and Justin Timberlake. I consider one of the best movies of 2016. Happiness is inside us, you just need someone to help you find it. No need to be sad and worry less. The Trolls helped the miserable Bergens and their fellow troll Branch being happy. And in the end, all of them became happy and lived in peace. This has sweet acoustics from Diana Ross,Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, and more. Never let someone ruin your happiness. I would recommend this film to everyone and those who are feeling blue. Remember, you deserve to be happy and you will never be defeated, just smile. Be positive and know that everything will be alright. If you want to be happy, lessen your negativity and go on with your life. Like in the lyrics of True Colors: And I see your true colors shining through, I see your true colors, that's why I love you. So don't be afraid to let them show your true colors, true colors are beautiful.Show me a smile then, don't be unhappy. Thank You So Much God Bless everybody."
29,Trolls,8,6 December 2016,"It was like somebody took my five year old daughter's soul, poured it into a computer and animated it.","This movie was all rainbows and cupcakes, sunshine and unicorns. I passed out for 20 minutes, woke up and nothing had changed. It was so happy it made me want to vomit.But the movie wasn't made for me, it was made for her, and when it was over she immediately turned to me and said ""That was a good movie!"" That's why I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. If you're a guy you'll spend most of the movie hoping something will explode (it won't). But if you have a little girl (or are one at heart), you must see this movie.And I have to admit, the music WAS pretty catchy..."
30,Trolls,8,12 March 2017,Fun Family Film,"So after reading a lot of negative reviews I decided to give my input. This film is very fun for every age. One downfall of this movie is that every troll (except for Branch) is exactly the same with no real different personalities. Also I wish they would have made this film a little more emotional (except for the final scene). I say this because I don't feel like the trolls were ever in any real danger. However, after saying all that I really enjoyed this film and so did my entire family. I also loved the music in this film. Justim Timberlake did an amazing job."
31,Trolls,8,26 February 2017,Awesome Kids movie,If you are looking for an educational movie the title Trolls should have already detoured you. It is a kid friendly family movie me and my husband were both able to sit through the entire thing without just despising it. Very colorful and upbeat which kept all 5 of my kiddos ages 5mon-6yr entertained. It was a good children's movie that I will probably purchase.
32,Trolls,10,20 February 2017,One of the best movies ever!,Trolls is a movie about courage and friendship as well as forgiveness and understanding each other:) they did an amazing job with the music and theatrical parts of this film. it was touching at times and fun at others. at the end of the day everyone finds true happiness and music is a big part of the celebration. What could be better than that!!!! love love love this film and highly recommend it to everyone at any age:)
33,Trolls,7,15 February 2017,"Glitter, and more Glitter...HUG TIME","Justin Timberlake is a well known singer/songwriter, with his all time hit song being, ""Can't Stop the Feeling."" His recent appearance in the movie ""Trolls"" capitalized on that. The movie runs song after song, featuring the mentioned song as the ending notes of joy. I'm fifteen. I think that this wasn't a waste of time and money. I have little brothers. They would watch this movie 10 times if they could. Making my feelings towards the movie above par. As a fan of music, I appreciated the songs that were both featured and played. Justin did a great job working with other artists such as Ariana Grande to come up with the movie's melodic soundtrack. Anna Kendrick definitely sings her handful of the music, with the majority of them being upbeat, live life to the fullest sort of songs. This is great if you enjoy a catchy song that gets stuck in your head throughout the day. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a song played on loop every now and then. This movie was a very predictable movie, with having nearly everything being wrapped in a nice, glitter-filled bow. When the inciting event came around, I could think for one minute and depict how the movie would end. But, I guess it was nice to listen to all the songs whilst my prediction unfolded. I think that if you are a child who is looking for a fairly humorous, childish movie, then ""Trolls"" is your film. A mom who has children should consider this movie for a fun weekend with the kids. Who knows? Maybe she will have a nice song stuck in her head too. I would suggest this movie for all who would like some laughs and a catchy tune."
34,Trolls,7,4 February 2017,The message was about teaching the truth behind falsified believes.,"This is a good film than how it was labelled. At least I enjoyed it, despite being an adult, particularly a male and a bachelor. It looks more a little kids' film than for anyone else. Because the film was based on the famous dolls. Usually film comes first and then follows its dolls to the markets. But this film has a reverse concept and a very much acceptable. Yes, it was not great as Disney's or Pixar's animations, but the DreamWorks animation is always there behind these two, considered the third best and according to that limit, you should expect the film.It's a musical like most of the animations are and one of the tracks made into the 2017 Oscars for best film songs list, but the film did not make into best the animated feature. Directed by the director of one of the sequels of 'Shrek' series. Technically, it sounds awesome with cute character models, colours, songs, music and particularly the voice-overs. The story wise, it's not bad, except the concept of eating trolls makes the real young kids go fright.Good for families and even better if you choose to watch it in digital 3D format. The runtime was good with a fine pace. In the line of smurfs, gnomes, fairies, and now these trolls to add in the list for children to watch growing up. Don't bother watching it if you are an adult and only like and enjoy adult films, other than seeing it neutral, as well as opinioning. Purely an entertaining film and I strongly suggest it for the little ones.7/10"
35,Trolls,10,30 January 2017,An unexpectedly good time,"I didn't intend to watch this movie but my kids wanted to see it. I was doing other stuff while they were watching it and somehow I got into it. The songs were really nice with some new ones and some covers of 80s songs. The story is pretty basic but the dialogue is very funny. Cooper made me laugh out loud with his sparse lines. Its too bad that we didn't get to know each of the trolls as they seem all interesting. The movie is not that long so I guess there was not enough time to flesh them out.Overall, its a light-hearted fun movie which will put you in a good mood... if you give it a chance."
36,Trolls,9,21 December 2016,Trolls: Great Movie for Kids & Adults,"Trolls is a great movie for all ages! It is a movie full of singing, bright colors and a great story line! The movie is intentionally directed towards kids but has little details through out the movie that will keep young adults laughing. The movies story line is very easily followed by all ages and has an entertaining roller coaster of events that lead all the way through the movie from beginning to end. If you are not a fan of movies with songs throughout them I would suggest you not to see this particular movie because there is a new song on almost every scene. The bright side to the songs are that they are up to date new songs that are actually pretty good and have a tendency to get stuck in your head and you will soon catch your self singing along with them. In an overview I would highly recommend seeing the movie Trolls, you will not regret it one bit!"
37,Trolls,7,29 November 2016,The Hidden Happiness Within,"This movie has some really nice allegorical lessons that are of great wisdom to the youngster and oldster as well. It goes around the notion of happiness and beauty. These two notions, easy as they seem, entail a lot of thoughts and many philosophers have wondered and wandered about them. It also depicts the causality of our happiness and sadness and the fact that what surfaces on the ground as a reluctance to be happy is no longer than an aftermath of deep incident such as what happened to Branch who happened to lost her life for him and the same for Poppy who happened to have never known ""real world"" as Branch told her. Bridget reminisces us of the mantra that the way we define truth is the same way we define beauty; however, we don't have to define but we're rather given definitions the rest of our lives and it's up to us to discover happiness inside us and go out to find who will find it for us inside us."
38,Trolls,8,19 November 2016,"Not Too Special, But Not a Bad Colorful Film for the Family","This review might contain some spoilers.Today, having seen the ad, and Twitter videos, I was admittedly more than excited that the 1980's Trolls not only returned, but were given modern looks. I also liked how the main characters, Poppy and Branch, were the polar opposites to each other.But, understandably, I didn't get too much hints as to what the story of the movie, TROLLS, would actually be about, so I had to watch it once I had the chance.Overall, the plot revolves around a concept of predator and prey, some of the preys going on a rescue mission, two unlikely couples, and remastered musical classics, and some original ones.The Trolls are a reluctant food that can make the otherwise depressed ogre-like creatures, the ""Bergens"", mysteriously happy, thus are the main course of the annual festival. Understandably, one day, Poppy's much younger father, and king, plots a grand escape with his subjects, with the ""no one gets left behind"" motto in mind, causing the Bergen chef to get banished by her king.That was 20 years from the main setting, when the Trolls, much to the warning and scolding of the pessimistic Troll, Branch, decide to party out loud, marking their escape's 20th anniversary... only for some to be caught by the chef shortly after. While trying to hide underground for 10 years with the ""I knew it!"" mentality, and refusing to help Poppy, Poppy in return gets the rest of the Trolls who didn't get captured to deplete Branch's supplies, probably to force him to help her on her rescue mission in due time.From there, things get interesting and colorful, with some interesting creatures and stuff along the way, as the rather determined Poppy, much to her dad's blessing, goes on the rescue mission by herself... and gets clobbered by the elements. Branch eventually shows up to rescue her from some spiders and, from there, we get to see the clash between optimism and pessimism from the two, en route to the Bergens' kingdom.From there, you'll notice unexpected additions and twists to the plots. If you've been noticing from the beginning, King Gristle Jr. had been a crush to a Bergen maid of similar age, Bridget, who has actually been feeling dispirited that King Gristle won't notice her at all. That's where the captured Trolls, with help from Poppy and Branch, come in. Despite the Trolls using their flexible hairs as a wig collectively, although cool, what we notice is, in return of finding a Troll who got eaten, but somehow saved himself, we have the movie's take on Cinderella. Instead of a glass slipper, Bridget leaves behind her skate. And, yes, the chef, who earned her return to the kingdom with the kidnapped Trolls, is supposed to be the movie's take on the evil stepmother... and the kingdom's dictator in the making. Not too original, but I appreciate the movie's take on certain plots and ideas from other stories.I did mention that there was a twist. The missing Troll sells the others out to save his own hide, and even the rest of the Troll kingdom as well! Thus, the chef is more than confident that she now has enough to resume the discontinued festival. At this point, after revealing to everyone that his singing, as a child, costed him his grandmother, thus transforming him into a pessimist, by the time Branch started to loosen up, the dispirited Poppy herself, and the others, lost their colors and became pessimistic as well, forcing Branch to sing, in attempt to keep everyone's chin, especially Poppy's, up. All the Trolls, even Branch, get their colors back. Somewhat predictable, and Bridget purposely freeing them, but they are cool overall, and how the Trolls returned to bail Bridget from the inevitable retribution.As you might realize since the movie's take on Cinderella, it also prepares the idea to fellow Bergens that they can actually be happy by other means, thus befriending the Trolls, much to the chef's displeasure, who, along with the Troll traitor, gets kicked out of the kingdom, and eaten by a random creature in the wild.So, yes. There are some predictable plots here and there, but you ought to appreciate the movie's Troll take on these.Still on the plot, apart from the predictability, I do have some minor complaints. I wondered why the Troll king, who didn't look too old, thought that he wasn't the king that he used to be to help Poppy on her mission. And, maybe instead of being a douche, the backstabbing Troll was actually trying to buy time to rescue everyone... although not necessarily successfully. And, maybe, the ending could have been a bit longer, and I wish I could have heard a lot more of Gwen Stefani as DJ Suki. Regardless, they didn't ruin the movie a bit.The sound effects and soundtracks were pretty cool, especially the movie's original soundtrack, and its take on classics. For example, when Poppy and Branch arrived at the Bergen kingdom, I was surprised to hear the movie's take on ""Clint Eastwood"" by Gorillaz, and what seemed to be a mass mocking of the band's main singer, 2D.Overall, it's not too original (I mean, they feature the same Troll toys of the 1980's, but now redesigned), also considering from plot ideas, but, as a family film, it's quite good. There were some pretty good writings, and funny moments we laughed, and giggled, at, and it's occasionally musical, if not colorful. It was an animated movie I was glad to watch after an average one like ""Storks"", and I actually recommend it."
39,Trolls,8,26 March 2017,Songs an adult can enjoy...finally,"This movie is the definition of today's POP culture including the songs, colors, animation and plot. It's a simple plot and it sticks the landing. Like good kids animation does, both motion or book form, it does not attempt to be realistic. It's a cute story that is fast paced and as an adult, it mixes new and old songs that were perfect for the movie and very good remixes, to the point I could actually listen to these songs in the car with my children verses ""Let it Snow"" or ""Do you want to build a snowman"" which make me want to jam ice-picks in my ears. I'm not a fan of the most recent Disney movies (i.e. Frozen) plots or songs. This movie does not try to cram complex concepts like the death of parents or falling in love in 5 minutes which leaves gaping plot holes, from an adult perspective. It's not trying to be grandiose. It's a kid movie told on kid level with enough nostalgia to rope parents in who are in their 30's and 40's. Think old school cartoons Smurfs and Gummy Bears crammed into one told with modern animation and songs."
40,Trolls,5,20 January 2017,50/50 Chance to like or hate it,"This film is about trolls who escaped from being eaten by these bigger ugly trolls who believe the only way to be happy is to eat a troll. Later on in the film Poppy (the Princess troll)l convinces their enemy's that happiness is inside all of us but sometimes you need help to bring it out; which leads to a happy ending. The themes in this film are pretty great but the execution of the film not so much. From the beginning to the end there are a number or sing and dance along's that were only in the movie to pass time. There are a lot of good things in the film and a lot of bad one's, however the number of bad ones are heavier. Overall, this film tried to be for adults and kids but failed. Instead, it's a kid film with singing and dancing. 5.2/10"
41,Trolls,9,16 December 2016,Very entertaining if you like singing,"This movie by musics top artists is a very good example on how kids can interpret the love of music. I felt like that this was like High School Musical for younger kids who don't understand the movie's true motif. The music in this movie made me feel very warm to know that children are getting introduced to such great music at the age that they are at. I felt tickled to know that ""Sounds of Silence"" by Simon And Garfunkel was included in the mix and gave the kids a more retro feel to it while keeping its family friendly theme.This movie has the CUTEST story line I have ever seen!! But, on the adult side of things if you like singing music that mostly appeal to kids and some adults will get the comedy if they watch closely and look for detailing!!!AWESOME MOVIE FOR EVERYONE! Can't wait to see it again real soon!!!"
42,Trolls,1,3 January 2017,Normality moral in disguise of Happiness moral.,"We see that throughout this very movie, the trolls are teaching us about being like everyone else. If everybody is happy, you have to be happy to. That is like, if everyone wears Levi's, you have to wear Levi's too. Oh, and shouldn't I mention how much of a freaking ass Poppy is to Branch? Always forcing him to sing. Because everyone else does it. And why can't Branch find happiness by doing something he enjoys that is not singing and dancing? Here is the real moral of the story: Be just like everyone else. If you don't, you are an outcast!"
43,Trolls,7,15 October 2016,Kids Will LOVE it,"Just caught this with my 12 year old daughter and 5 yr old grandson...and they absolutely LOVED it.They sat open - mouthed the whole way through...and I must add that I was not far behind them.Typical Dreamworks here..lots of fun and gallons of syrup to make this a sugar coated 90 minutes of fun.Has taken a lot of flack but as I am the 1st to review can I just ask the grown ups to leave well alone and let the kids review it.All kids will love the music and characters as this is a proper feel good affair for 12 and under..I look forward to reading all the ""Grown Ups"" whinging about stuff..but like I said..this is for the little ones."
44,Trolls,8,12 November 2016,"Feel The Joy, Feel Alive","Video games, documentaries, true stories, songs, theatrical productions, mechanical attractions or books are some of the sources of inspiration for the seventh art to develop a universe full of ideas. Children's films certainly opt for puerile subjects correlated with today; the toy industry its main ally. Rich in genre and style, adaptations have been varied about small and innocuous objects which entertain the kids: ""Ouija"" by Mike Flanagan, ""Lego Movie"" by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" and clearly ""Toy Story"" by John Lasseter are vast references in the prominent sub- genre. As a demonstration of its infallible success at the box office and acceptance by movie critics, they are mostly franchises willing to continue expanding. It's patent that the plurality of this type of films totally controls child audience, and the latest invention in the subject also does it.From the studio that brought you ""Shrek"", ""Madagascar"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"", comes out a colorful range of characters ( they hope it becomes in a profitable franchise ); with a conception very similar to ""The Smurfs"", ""Trolls"" or ¬´Dam Dolls¬ª (original name) is the most recent work of animation factory, Dreamworks. The Danish fisherman and woodcutter Thomas Dam created in 1959 a doll of excellent quality, featuring sheep wool hair and glass eyes. An error in the copyright made its reputation was biggest due to the manufacture of illegal imitations of minor detail, was so great the commercial impact obtained, that they even harbored superstitions related to the good luck that the consumer will acquire. Nowadays, the popularity of toys is insubstantial, however, its filmic project comes loaded with tons of marketing, ranging from dolls to music discs.What If I told you that you can have the opportunity to experience true and complete happiness, eating a positive small being? ""Trolls"" is about this. These tiny and adorable creatures to live, to hug, to dance, and to sing every day, every hour. Like the Smurfs, these friends share singularities Park and emotional certain designating your color and way of being. Unfortunately, his perennial satisfaction is affected by the despite and hideous Bergens, desirous of a dose of love and joy. Years of abstinence have passed since last joy festival, and now the Chef (Christine Baranski) has located the whereabouts of small enthusiasts. She abducts a good part of them, obliging Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and her pole apart Branch (Justin Timberlake) - something like Joy and Sadness from ""Inside Out"" - to rescue their family. An adventure of discoveries, deceptions and union will do the journey a passage full of color, music and teachings.In movies like these is frequent to see great singers, models, actors or characters lend their unmistakable voices in order to give more brilliance and personality to the film. Kendrick, Timberlake, Deschanel, Stefani or Corden are the main team, identifiable by their mere surnames. Seeing the artistic convergence of its leads, ""Trolls"" is the perfect musical for a contingent wave of children's films of such tone, which are to come. Classics of yesteryear and modern classics are put together in each scene in a wonderful way, usually accompanied by an original dance routine and flashing graphics. Earth, Wind and Fire's ""September,"" Lionel Richie's ""Hello,"" rhythmical ""Can't Stop the Feeling"" by Timberlake or the duet on ""Get Back Up Again"" will make you provide a chorus, slightly move your feet or scream wildly with trolls on screen. Obviously, it is not ""Frozen"", but offers a different direction to musical animated movies.Thanks to the development of the story, it is noticeable that screenwriters and artists have been inspired by the big successes of Pixar. The most striking is the template selected from ""Monsters Inc"" and ""Inside Out"" for characters and situations. It conceives memorable characters with difficulty, the same thing naturally attained the Pixar film with all its monsters; ""Trolls"" does the attempt, nonetheless, categorizes its characters in recurring roles, Bridget as Cinderella, Cooper as Rex from ""Toy Story"", Poppy as Joy from ""Inside Out"", and the most obvious: Cloud Guy, comical-periodic role almost copied of all feature films in Pixar.Although it is occasionally cloying, too childish and sickeningly sweet, it enchants with each frame. Visually, the art department, visual effects and animation capture the sensibility of the moment, with thousands of textures such as felt, foamy, glitter, or hundreds of vivid colors with different tonalities, and nuances; the situations get their greater brightness in front of the spectators.For those who manage to touch the ground, sitting in a movie theater seat, ""Trolls"" can be too noisy, colorful or sickly-sweet. For those who have to go the bathroom with dad, ""Trolls"" is an explosion of teachings - joy isn't in the tangible, is within yourself -, music and toys that you will want to buy out of the theater. Being one or the other, ""Trolls"" is a proper continuation of modern musical films, with a powerful soundtrack, irresistible visuals, a concise story and a rebirth for the marketing of the film."
45,Trolls,8,10 November 2016,Cute Movie of The Trolls,"As it shows a group of people called the Trolls.

With the help of the kind maid who loves the Bergen prince turned king in charge secretly.Really a cute movie! One to show that you can find true happiness."
46,Trolls,8,9 November 2016,Not the best but far from the worst,"OK after seeing this movie I am now able to say that I am not sure if it was the best or not but I can say that I personally had a blast yes I went by myself and laughed long and hard take the family or go by yourself to see it my only word of caution is the fact that it is a little scary for the smallest of kids u may need to keep reminding them the trolls will be able to survive they are in to constant peril, getting almost eaten by snakes giants etc and other dangerous things happen to the trolls as well my personal favorite is poppy but they are all very sweet and lovable except for grumpy attitudes of some it has a good lesson in working together and tolerance of others who are different from us and are hard to get along with at times"
47,Trolls,8,7 November 2016,A good sing-a-long movie for the entire family,"I know what you're thinking: Why would I go see Trolls? Well, the answer is simple. I took my lovely little girls. And surprise, surprise I liked the movie. So, let's go.Synopsis: After the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy, the happiest Troll ever born, and the curmudgeonly Branch set off on a journey to rescue her friends. Starring: Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick Director: Walter Dorn, Mike MitchellFirst, let me say that if you don't like movies that have songs every three to five minutes, then this isn't the movie for you. But, if you love music and love to sing along with some of the songs, then this movie is for you. I found myself singing along with quite a few of the songs. Namely, Hello by Lionel Richie and True Colors by Phil Collins. I do have to say that Timberlake nailed True Colors as well.The voice actors throughout the entire movie were the right types of people for the roles, with exception to Timberlake for a bit of the movie. I was perplexed as to why he was cast as a cranky, should-be- happy troll, but it made since about halfway through the movie. Anna Kendrick is just her peppy upbeat self through the movie.For a movie that was played up to be an extremely happy movie there were a lot of sad parts. I couldn't believe how slow it got during those parts as well. That would have to be the biggest downfall of the movie: the slow parts. Luckily, they didn't last that long.When it comes to direction for an animated movie, I have a hard time making a rating off it. So, I'm guessing the directors did a good job. No argument about how they did it.The story is a good one. Simple, too. A peaceful existence is disturbed by a group of outsiders. Then, a visionary has an idea to help the people in trouble but needs the outcast to help out as well. I'm sure you've seen a movie like it before, but this one has the music part to add something new to the story.A good movie and is strongly recommended.Rating: 8 out of 10That's it for me folks. If you would like to continue to follow my post, go ahead and like this page. Go check out these sites, and don't forget to check out my books. I have added the sites to the bottom of the page."
48,Trolls,7,6 November 2016,Amazing film both for kids and adults,"This was a movie I went to see with my little brother and I truly was expecting a regular movie that would be only entertaining for children, after seeing the trailers the suspicions I had were confirmed. I was so wrong. This was a movie where I laughed beginning to end. Tons of adult jokes and little details that kids don't see, but makes it very entertaining for the adults watching. I recommend this movie to everyone, but, specially to people going through problems or just feeling down. This movie passes on a great positive message that, in my personal opinion, will be great for everyone. So, pick up your kids or simply go with friends and enjoy a movie with all colors!"
49,Trolls,2,11 November 2016,Not for children,"Poor performance (2/10) once the best animation studio. Horrible script (written under the influence of hallucinogens). Inappropriate humor in the worst traditions of American toilet jokes (eg, multiple shots back to any awkward items). Discouraging soundtrack (replete with musical interludes), which, after all, smooths talented dubbing (dubbing gave +1 0/10). Ridiculous color and visual effects, which allowed my daughter to enjoy the 3D-animated film was never put on the 3D glasses (even 1 to 0/10). The moral of the cartoon: breaks all the rules and logic, act rude, betray and scoff at the neighbors, but sing and ""believe in the good,"" and you win."
50,Trolls,,19 January 2017,Sorry But It Didn't Work for Me,"Trolls (2016)** (out of 4)The Bergens are a group of very unhappy creatures who believe that the only way to have fun is by eating trolls. Once a year the Bergens eat trolls but as the film starts they're about to chomp but the small trolls make their escape. Flash-forward twenty-years and the trolls are happy and safe until after a massive party a group of taken. Now it's up to Princess Poppy to try and save her friends.TROLLS is a film that I'm sure many people are going to love. I'm sure the majority of kids that watch this are going to love it and have a great time with it. I took my kids to see it and they all loved it. My girlfriend loved it as well. With that said, I'm sorry but I'll be the negative troll and say that I really didn't care too much for the picture. It's certainly not an awful movie but at the same time this is pretty much a middle tier animated film that has a couple cute and funny moments but not enough to make me want to see the film again.There's no question that the animation itself is excellent to look out and this is especially true for the wild and colorful nature of the images. I really loved how colorful the picture was and there's no question that this was the greatest thing in the movie. I thought both Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake were fine in their vocal performances.So, why didn't I like TROLLS more? There's no question the blame for me goes towards the story. There's just not a very interesting story being told here. How many times have we seen a film where a character makes a mistake and then we have to go on a journey? There's really nothing new or fresh done with the story here and to me it was just rather boring and lacked any real adventure."
51,Trolls,8,8 January 2017,"Not deep, but surprisingly fun, even if you're not a kid","While most professional critics were pretty hard on 'Trolls', attacking it's forced upbeat tone and synthetic nature, and while I can understand those comments and more importantly that it lacks the depth and risk-taking of the very best animated films, I can't dismiss the bottom line that I had a very good time watching this, laughing out loud a number of times. Basically the Trolls are an absurdly happy lot, whereas the comparatively giant Bergens are miserable by nature. Except when they eat a Troll. Then they briefly become happy before falling back into malaise. Hence, conflict! :-)There are some very funny, witty lines, some great character designs, some effective animated slapstick, and some clever, slightly twisted use of songs from the 70s and 80s. Yes, cynically those songs were probably used to help the adults in the audience who brought their kids, but they work really well in the context of the film. This IS a film aimed at younger kids. It doesn't have the more sophisticated plot and character twists of ¬ñ for example ¬ñ the Pixar films. But it does have a good heart and a silly sense of humor (and even a nice message), and ¬ñ at least on the night I saw it ¬ñ that was enough for this old guy (and my wife), both a good 10 times older than the audience this was aimed at."
52,Trolls,10,19 November 2016,"A great, colorful juke-box musical from Dreamworks Animation","You know, I used to have the ""Troll"" dolls as a kid, but not anymore. I have seen the trailer for this movie (the trolls' first movie) online, and I thought it was a great, colorful juke-box musical; and it is.The film started 20 years ago when the happy little trolls were being harvested from their tree by the ogre-ish Bergens as food. They eat the trolls by a means to be happy. Fortunately the trolls led by their king Peppy escape through a tunnel during a Bergen festival, where their young prince would taste his first troll. Now years later in their new forest village, the optimistic and extremely happy Princess Poppy organizes a big party to celebrate their escape. But the village's grey, glum, survivalist nay-sayer Branch thinks it's a terrible idea, for the loud music and bright, glitterly lights would alert the Bergens. And it has when a Bergen chef who was banished on that very date 20 years ago, spotted the party's lights and captures nine of the trolls, who are Poppy's friends. So Poppy takes it upon herself to ask Branch to go with her to Bergen Town to save her friends. Of course Branch refuses and Poppy sets off by herself. But after an encounter with a bunch of spider-like monsters, Branch saves Poppy knowing she wouldn't last long beyond their village. So the two trolls decide to continue the journey to Bergen Town. And that is all I could tell you folks.All I have to say is that I love the film's animation, humor and music."
53,Trolls,8,17 November 2016,A great soundtrack,"I will say one of my favorite aspects of the film is the Justin timber lake song can't stop the feeling which is this films version of pharell Williams happy form despicable me 2. This film also marks a film comeback for Justin after his small role in the movie inside Llewelyn Davis and i will,s at it is great to see him back in action again. The story of this film deals with the struggles of the trolls who have to worry about the Bergen who are tall and scary creatures who keep trying to eat trolls as way of finding some kind of happiness that was taken from them and trying to reclaim that, while I will admit that it wasn't the best animated films have seen, but I will say the visuals impress me in addition to the fine performances of Anna Kendrick who plays poppy one of the happiest trolls."
54,Trolls,7,16 November 2016,Gorgeous,"Trolls are legendary anthropomorphic beings of the Scandinavian folklore who are usually presented as evil and mischievous creatures. However in this movie they are shown as nice and sweet ones that are chased and hunted by the much bigger bergens who are pessimistic and can only feel happy by eating trolls. The plot develops itself around this and the efforts of trolls still free to rescue their fellows who have been captured by the bergens to be cooked and served in a banquet under their king's authority. At a certain moment the trolls make a friendship with a bergen girl who is a maid appointed to cook the trolls but is in love with the king although of course he ignores that. Then the trolls directed by the young Poppy do everything they can to help her to make those dream of her to become true what they finish to achieve after convincing also the other bergens that they can be happy without having to eat them. The movie is gorgeous in terms of images, sceneries and action. And the puppet dolls that make the characters are extremely expressive on their looks and facial features. A good movie to be seen either by children or grown-ups."
55,Trolls,8,16 November 2016,A colorful & fun film that the kids will love.,"Trolls is a movie about tiny adorable creatures, who are happy all the time. They love singing, dancing & hugging. On the other end of the spectrum are the Bergens, who are constantly sad & negative about everything. When the Bergens attack Troll Village, it is up to two Trolls, named Poppy(Anna Kendrick) & Branch(Justin Timberlake), to save the rest of their friends. Trolls is a thoroughly enjoyable film. The animation is unique & top-notch. This colorful world will keep kids & adults glued to the big screen, especially in 3D. The renditions of many famous songs, are wonderful. The only drawback of this movie is that, the humor will only make kids laugh. The grown-ups might chuckle here & there but, that's it. Not to worry though. This film, still has a great story & a beautiful message. The voice-over work by the cast, is spot on. Anna Kendrick is spectacular as Poppy. Justin Timberlake is outstanding as Branch. Zooey Deschanel is amazing as Bridget. Christopher Mintz- Plasse is brilliant as King Gristle. Christine Baranski is perfect as Chef. Russell Brand is awesome as Creek. Jeffrey Tambor, John Cleese, Gwen Stefani, James Corden, Ron Funches, Aino Jawo, Caroline Hjelt, Kunal Nayyar & Quevenzhane Wallis are great as, King Peppy, King Gristle Sr., DJ Suki, Biggie, Cooper, Satin, Chenille, Guy Diamond & Harper, respectively. Trolls is worth a watch, with your entire family. Go, embrace your inner happiness."
56,Trolls,7,5 November 2016,Can't Stop The Positivity of This Film. Get ready to Troll the Soundtrack,"Trolls! When you think of these mystical creatures most minds will picture tall, ugly creatures with pronounced booger filled noses and living under a bridge. But if you are a fan of the toys, many might remember the half-naked, multicolored hair figurines with the happy, semi creepy, smiles. I'm sure you've guessed the movie from the theme now right? Yes, today I review DreamWorks' Trolls starring the voices of Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick. Let's get started shall we? LIKES1. Colorful, Animation: No surprise here, DreamWorks knows how to animate and Trolls is yet another example of the talent. Our characters run, jump, sing, and more importantly dance in impressive style that brings the unique world to life. The colorful characters (in both skin tone and personality) are charming, and the energy they infuse into the scenes adds another element to the animation. And the design of all the creatures is very unique almost as it is being designed for¬Ömerchandise.2. Very Fun, Positive Movie: If you didn't get this from the trailers, Trolls is a movie all about being upbeat, fun, and very positive in nature. The pint sized cast will keep you laughing through the entire movie, spreading joy as they dance across the land. I found my spirits lifted through much of the movie as the trolls explained the tried and true lesson of happiness coming from within. Yes, it is a bit preachy, but it was nice to see positivity as the main theme for a change instead of some political issue masked in another form. 3. Kicking Soundtrack: The best thing for me in this film though was the awesome tunes our music directors picked for the list. Many of the songs are as upbeat and energetic as the trolls who are singing them. Much of the songs are covers of famous songs, but these remixes work very well and represent the theme of their accompanying scenes as Kendrick, and sometimes JT, led the way. The dance numbers were even more impressive, filled with fireworks, light shows, and choreography that you always dreamed the little toys could do. This reviewer sees ITunes blowing up with Trolls soundtrack sales and it's for a good reason. DISLIKES:1. A little stupid/kiddy: Before you shout blasphemy hear me out. Yes, animated features are geared towards kids and meant to be silly at times. But adults know there are times where it goes too deep into that territory. Trolls has a few of these moments that sort of derailed the momentum of the movie. Fortunately, these moments are few and far between, but this reviewer felt the storyboard team could have used the time to better develop characters and make the story more complex. Speaking of which¬Ö2. Simplistic Story: If you haven't guessed from the trailers (and this review) Trolls isn't the most complex story to grace the market. Again hear me out. Think about films like Despicable Me, How to Train Your Dragon, or most Disney films. They usually have deep plot lines with dynamic relationships and character development. Trolls has a little of this especially in the stories of Branch and Bridget who need the biggest personality adjustments of the bunch. Outside of that¬Öthe film lacks depth, because most of the characters are on happy pills who only want to dance and sing. While this is certainly entertaining, the simplicity is a bit predictable and boring at times. I guess they focused more on music and dancing instead of storyboard. 3. Pointless Characters: My biggest peeve has to be the missed potential with the characters. Trolls has a very diverse cast from the glitter infused Guy Diamond to the four legged, hat wearing, giraffe troll Cooper¬Öyeah. Anyway, such interesting characters would hopefully have a little more involvement in the film. Unfortunately, they didn't do much with these characters outside of a few good zingers and some simplistic, comical moves during a chase. Certainly a cast like this could have had some interesting powers to donate on their quest (music blasting, super hair strength, heck even manipulating their hair into crafty shapes). But nope, these characters are reduced to nothing more than merchandising whose colors are meant to hypnotize your children to wanting more toys. I guess this is how the studio will make the cash back from all the stars they drafted in this movie. Nevertheless, Trolls secondary characters need some development in future (inevitable) sequels. THE VERDICT:Trolls is a fun, energetic dance party packaged into a ninety-minute run time. The music is the strongest aspect of the movie and the colorful animation is designed to support it. And when your toes aren't tapping, the dialogue and voice acting are sure to give you some laughs along the way. However, there was some wasted potential in terms of stories and characters, which could have made this movie so much better had they captured it. Regardless, DreamWorks has released a decent product this weekend and it was nice to see some positivity for once. Do I recommend this one for the theater? Hmmm, I think you could skip this one and wait for DVD, but definitely check out the soundtrack soon to get a fun treat for the ears. My scores: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0"
57,Trolls,8,29 October 2016,"Pretty, but rather stupid","A nice piece of kindergarten animation, not arty-farty, kinda primitive. However, if you don't mind children's movies (or maybe you are a 'bronie', or just liked modeling clay when you were young), you won't be disappointed. There's nothing so special about the love story (it's rather a 'friendship tale'). Poppy, the plump pink Troll girl, happens to be gobbled up several times, either by a fish or by a predator plant (it's not clear how she got out and went on her way): all the Trolls really have a very 'tasty' look, reminding of cookies. The most developed character, not counting them is the evil and toothy Chefin (the Prince, too, doesn't count). There's also some mocking at Cinderella's story, which appears a bit entertaining (at first). The cartoon hasn't got much sense, neither it has any full-fleshed characters. It can be watched, though, and even bring pleasure, if you just want to relax."
58,Trolls,8,29 October 2016,A feel good movie for all the family,"Trolls is a 2016 animated film about a cheerful princess named Poppy voiced by Anna Kendricks who lives in a place where all the trolls are cheerful and they love to sing except for one troll named Branch voiced by Justin Timberlake who is very pessimistic. But when Poppy's friends are kidnapped by an evil troll named Chef, its up to Poppy and Branch to save the trolls from Chef and get their friends back before its too late. Overall i found this animated film enjoyable. Yes i knew who was voicing who like Anna Kendrick, Justin timberlake, Russell brand etc it was overall a good film. The music is good and the animation is great. Also i noticed a nod to Cinderella between Bridget the troll maid voiced by Zooey Deshnail and the prince who wants to be happy all the time voiced by Christoph Minz Plase. If you have kids they'd like it even if you are a kid at heart, you'd enjoy it. 8/10"
59,Trolls,9,25 October 2016,A film that knows itself and it's audience scarily well,"Unashamedly merchandise-worthy, psychedelically colourful, heartwarming and feel good,Trolls is one of the few films that has such a lack of shame at it's flaws that it's somewhat charming while still keeping enough story elements fresh and tense to keep audience glued to the screen.If for nothing else, see Trolls as a filmfeeling no shameat being weird and wonderful.MILD SPOILERS: The relationship progression between more than 1 pair of characters is engaging enough to keep many older viewers watching."
60,Trolls,1,21 December 2017,Trolls doesn't measure up to Dreamworks standards..,"Based on the popular toys, Trolls centers on two tiny trolls called Poppy and Branch, who go on a quest to rescue their friends from being eaten at the annual Trollstice, held by the miserable Bergens.When I first saw the teaser trailer for Trolls, I knew it would be something quite unbearable, and BOY was I right! The whole movie is offensively patronizing, and lazy; Instead of being original, or creative, it pads out 80% of it's narrative with characters randomly performing recognizable pop songs. With little to no concern about whether these jukebox musical numbers, help the story to move forward, or add something to the film. It's the oldest trick in the book; Emotionally manipulate the audience by referencing happy pop songs that sound comfortably familiar. It's much easier than coming up with your own material to satisfy them, or enrich their minds.This isn't my only gripe with the movie though; It's lead characters are SO one-dimensional and bland, that we know how their character arcs will play out as soon as we see them on screen! Not to mention, the film also forces these two into a romantic connection, just because it's the usual Hollywood tradition. Plus, it's because the studio thinks that audiences are suckers for anything romantic. This just comes across as formulaic and contrived, because they share SO little chemistry; They spend most of the movie arguing.The cherry on top of Trolls problem's has to be it's desperate and cringe-inducing attempts at being cool, hip and relevant to today's generation. From having characters rap out of nowhere, to having a troll baby scream ""YOLO!"" at a crazy rave party. It's so embarrassing, and it's going to date this movie TERRIBLY. Trolls is a desperate, awkward and uninspired movie, with nothing creative, or imaginative to offer. To say that I didn't like it, would be an understatement."
61,Trolls,1,20 December 2017,Does not deserve a G rating.,"First off, if you are a Christian, do not let your kids see this movie. The main idea of this movie is essentially that the way to get rid of an evil spirit is just to ""be happy"" enough, which is obviously not what the Bible teaches.Second, even if your family isn't religious, your kids have no business watching this movie. Either they will be creeped out by it, in which case they are too young (like I said, the ""G"" rating is outrageous), or they will not be creeped out by it, in which case they are too old or too mature to be wasting their time on this mindless drivel.Not only this movie, but the entire genre of ""overly-happy sappy generic messages, pretty colours"" is an insult to any one who has ever experienced the real world. Similar to shows and movies like My little Pony Friendship is Magic, Sofia the First, Puppy in My pocket, or Care Bears, they are overly-sweet, vapid, pandering, the characters aren't put in any danger, or the characters themselves have no personality. While I was relieved that the movie WASN'T overly-sappy, or this decade's version of ""A Troll in Central Park"", it instead tries to be hip, cool and relevant, all while failing. Not to mention that the characters aren't put in any danger. Don't let your kids watch Trolls, or the upcoming TV show. Buying them the toys is fine, but keep them away from the upcoming animated series. Trolls has no educational or moral value. The whole theme of the entire Troll Dolls franchise is that all your problems will just go away if only you and your friends just ""Be Happy"" enough. American Greetings, if you're reading this, than all I have to say to you is try telling that to the the little kid who just lost a friend to cancer, or the kid who's dog just got put to sleep.There are some who would defend this movie as being just harmless fun even if they do acknowledge that it doesn't have a very strong moral foundation. To that I say, first of all, anyone over age 4 will be bored to tears over this intelligence-insulting movie. It is not fun, and as for me, I have no fond nostalgic memories of the Troll dolls themselves. Second, little kids need to be learning how to be effectively dealing with the problems life throws their way, and learning that ""Happiness"" isn't always enough. They also need to learn the harsh realities of life, like the fact that holding hands and standing in a circle with your friends shouting the ""Happiness is inside you"" message over and over again will not bring your dead grandmother back."
62,Trolls,1,13 December 2017,I HATE this movie!,"There are very few times in life, that I can say that a film has felt like it has ROBBED me of something; like I felt like less of a human being when I walked out of the cinema. This is one of those rare cases. So, Trolls is the newest film from Dreamworks Animation, and boy howdy are they heading backwards with this one! It's based off the old troll dolls that have been around since the 1960's. In this movie, there's this race of trolls, who are living in a forest, they've got lovely lives, they dance, they laugh, they hug a lot. But then one day, this big bad thing called a Bergen comes, and takes some of the trolls away to be eaten. And now it's up to the princess Poppy, played by Anna Kendrick, and this grumpy troll named Branch, voiced by Justin Timberlake to try and get their friends to freedom... and yeah! From that synopsis ALONE, you know exactly what's going to happen in this thing! Okay, now listing one positive: The animation in this movie, isn't half bad; it's very bright, it's very colourful, it's very pretty to look at, so I'll say good job on the animation team for that! But NO. I'm not being nice to this one, let's just get into this MESS. Watching this movie has got to be one of the most insufferable cinema experiences, I've had in a while! This film just feels like an excuse to have a string of pop songs stacked together with a vague, insanely predictable plot, woven in between them. If you have seen a kid's film, you have seen this plot done, and done better, a hundred thousand times, before! It's all about finding happiness, and being happy, and I HATE films that have messages like that. Throughout this whole movie, I kept thinking back to films like Inside Out where the lesson was, the necessity for unhappiness. It's okay for kids to learn that being unhappy, isn't always a bad thing! Being sad, or angry, is important for a person to experience in life, especially nowadays! In movies like Trolls, the lesson is quite simply ""Be happy, all the time always, and everything will just sort itself out."" That is an AWFUL message, and it annoys me that we're STILL getting movies that teach it to kids! The characters in this movie were beyond, obnoxious; just the way they would talk with these INSANELY dated phrases: ""Solid burn, Branch"". Solid burn, returned"". It gets terrible! Now let's talk about the songs. Yeah, they're bad. It's just the fact that they were bad, it's the fact that they take up the MAJORITY of the movie! Every 5 minutes, they will just cut to another pop song, and then another one, and then another, and then another, and then another. It was just this endless of infuriating pop songs, that just never seems to end! Half of the songs didn't even make any sense, I mean there's a moment when the characters start singing ""Clint Eastwood"" by the Gorillaz, and I was just left going, WHY? As a person who is really not a big fan of musicals, in fact I hate most of them, this was my impression of what PAIN would be like! Not to mention the fact that the movie is INCREDIBLY annoying, it's also got some of the moronic, and potentially harmful messages, a kid's film could HAVE in this day and age! We are living in a time, where emotional problems in children are becoming more and more apparent, so just telling them to just put on a smile and be happy, and then ALL their trouble will go away, is not only stupid, it's DANGEROUS. So, to sum up, this movie was just disturbing. The characters were insanely annoying, the plot is recycled from 100 other kid's films, the songs make me want to take a cheese grater to my ears, and the message is some of the most BACKWARDS a kid's film can BE."
63,Trolls,,27 November 2017,Mostly Goes Through the Motions,"To me there are two kinds of animated films. There are those that approach animation as an art form and use it to tell stories in a way that wouldn't be possible otherwise. And then there are those that are cynical cash cows and throw up some generic lessons on screen in the belief that these films are made for kids and so don't really need to be that good.""Trolls"" is mostly the latter, though it does get some points for me for being one of the most colorful films I've ever seen, and there is plenty of visual dazzle. But the people who made this are mostly phoning it in.Justin Timberlake, who voices the main character, scored an Oscar nomination for writing one of the only original songs in the film, ""Can't Stop the Feeling.""Grade: B-"
64,Trolls,1,25 November 2017,"I know this is just an unpopular opinion, but....","I did not like this movie, for several reasons:1. The characters were flat, one-dimensional, and oddly unlikable. I didn't like Poppy, because she was just a huge modern Disney Princess clich√©, and Branch was incredibly rude and obnoxious.2. The message was basically ""be happy, all the time always, and everything will just sort itself out"". That is not only a terrible, and dangerous message to 5 year old's, it's also painting the world in a black and white format, which is not how the world works. Kids need to learn knowledge and awareness to survive in the real world. And finally..3. Why would Dreamworks make this movie? I get it was probably just trying to be a simple, kids movie cash-grab, but that's not an excuse for sucking. Remember, Dreamworks can make amazing movies from time to time, like The Prince Of Egypt, or Spirit, that can even battle 1900's Disney movies. While this movie isn't the worst by Dreamworks standards, it's still a bland, cookie-cutter movie, made just to sell merchandise."
65,Trolls,2,20 November 2017,Good for kids but for people older... that's another story,"This is the biggest letdown that Dreamworks ever made! They try to be Disney but TOO MUCH SINGING!! Disney movies are better because they limit their singing. Anyways they sing so much that I don't know what's the story, hell if there is a story. It tried to be hip for kids and ends up being all hipster and stuff. I rather watch that cheesy horror movie with the same name then this crap. DON'T WATCH IT!!!"
66,Trolls,4,19 November 2017,I don't quite understand the message of this movie,"As far as contemporary kid's films go, this film is what you should expect; it's relevant to young children with it's jokes, references and song choice and the visuals are somewhat pleasing. A young child will love this movie for sure but for an adult it can be a bit of a pain to sit through due the aforementioned features. Now, the reason I watched this film is because my younger sister turned it on at a relatives house whom we were visiting- I decided I may as well watch it too. Towards the beginning, I had no interest in the film of course, until a bit later on, I try to search for the message of the film. The ogres or whatever- the deplorable looking guys that eat the trolls- spontaneously start singing ""Clint Eastwood"" by Gorillaz. This is what really confused me because this is a song about smoking weed to get happy, and those creatures likewise,eat the trolls to be happy. So my guess is that the song choice was intentional, a belief backed up later by the film when the main protagonist says some tripe about 'not consuming things to be happy'. Is this film a 90 minute advert on not doing drugs? I guess my mind looks too far into stupid superficial things when I'm bored. If you're looking for a good family movie, just watch Kubo."
67,Trolls,9,16 November 2017,"The Happiest, Loudest, Craziest Movie in awhile","This movie is just made of joy, to be honest. Our main characters are surprisingly multidimensional in more than just how they're animated, Poppy and Branch are full fleshed out characters, and the story is absolutely wonderful. It's a very Smurf-y tale (the TV series, not the movies), but it puts a nice spin on it with great animation, music, and characters. The dialogue is great for all ages in my opinion, and it never leaves wit behind even with its mildly slapstick-like sequences. It helps that the humor is quite a few grades above fart and poop jokes. The animation is smooth, and the textures are amazing--it looks almost like stop animation in most places with the attention to detail to make everything and everyone look kind of fuzzy. All in all, the would receive a 10/10 if the ending hadn't been quite as abrupt as I felt it was. The story cruised by smoothly at a regular pace up until the last few sequences, when I felt it was a little rushed. But it's one of my favorite movies, and it brings a smile to my face every time I watch it or hear one of the songs."
68,Trolls,10,30 October 2017,"Fun, comical family movie. The bad reviews are idiotic.","Great movie about choosing your attitude despite your circumstances, the importance of community, and the weight of leadership. A welcome message amidst a culture of isolation, device addiction, and hyper group-think. I might be a tad bias since the two main characters basically have the same dynamic as my wife and I. Cloud guy is awesome."
69,Trolls,4,30 October 2017,Can't Scrapbook Your Way Out of This,"Trolls was not that great. Definitely not one of Dreamworks' better films. The troll characters were adorable, but a bit over the top. There wasn't any attempt of characterization with anyone except the two main trolls. The rest were just filler and background noise. Making their personalities super happy and hyper was fitting for the quirky dolls I grew up with in the 1990s, but the dialogue and story were so badly developed that the whole movie lacked the entertaining aspects it should have had. Not even the villains were interesting. I couldn't even tell you their names. The animation was done really well (no surprise as Dreamworks is great). Making the environments look like arts and crafts, with felt textures, glitter and sewing, was a neat way to build the world, even if it looked cartoonish at times. The scrapbooking was super cute. I loved that Poppy made elaborate cards for all occasions (or just because). It resulted in some funny situations. It did feel like Dreamworks tried to make up for the bad story by making the imagery really busy as a distraction, and that didn't help the situation.I was expecting original music, and was a bit disappointed to find out that the songs were mainly mash-ups of popular hits. With the exception of a few, not even very good hits. Justin Timberlake's voice was wasted in this. He only got one song, but it was one of the better ones in the movie.Overall, I probably wouldn't watch this movie again."
70,Trolls,10,28 October 2017,This movie is a masterpiece,"this is the best movie ever and I am really surprised how this movie rating is so low, it should be given an eight out of ten in my opinion.It should also win an Oscar.It's that kind of impressive animation which makes u happy, delightful and confident on a gloomy day.This movie gives you hope, positivity to never give up. anyone's mood will be cheerful after watching this wonderful animated movie. please do watch, highly recommended."
71,Trolls,10,18 October 2017,Best movie ever made!,Trolls is like one big huge party all the time. Princess Poppy is such an amazing troll that I aspire to be like. There was not one second that I was not enjoying. I watch the movie at least twice a week. Branch is such a crucial part and how his character develops through out the movie is admirable at the least. Trolls is truly a cinematic piece of excellence! :)
72,Trolls,10,17 October 2017,Suggestion to producer,"I hope the producer of this movie reads this, I think you should make a Trolls 2 and it should have Poppy and Branch falling in love and getting married and tell a story about Poppy getting kiddnapped by the same spider creatures that she fell in the web of in the first one and then Branch rescues her and then poppy gets pregnant and has troll babies with Branch but make it like Trolls 3 for that part. :)"
73,Trolls,,17 October 2017,Trolls are good for kids,"The movie Trolls, directed by Mike Mitchell and Walt Dohrn, teaches young children that everyone can be happy and that you can be accepted for who you are. Bergens, the bad guys in the movie, believe that in order to find happiness you need to eat a troll. Once a year, they celebrate Trollstice where one Bergen is selected to eat a troll. Anna Kendrick stars as Poppy, the Queen of the Trolls and the happiest troll, who goes out on an adventure to save her friends that have been stolen by the hungry Bergens. Along the way, there is one Bergen named Bridget, played by Zooey Deschanel, who is love with King Gristle Jr.. Poppy tells Bridget that she can get the king to notice her in return for her friends freedom. Children should watch Trolls because it demonstrates happiness, courage, and teamwork as Poppy and her overly-cautious friend Branch, played by Justin Timberlake, go out on an adventure to save their friends.Poppy demonstrates a tremendous amount of courage in this movie. Poppy is given the responsibility of leading the Trolls just as her father once did. As the new queen, she is ready to take on the challenge of leading the tribe. Believing that they were safe from the Bergens, they threw a big, loud party with music. However, the cook for the Bergens found them capturing a handful of them to prepare for the King. Poppy knew that this was her fault and took on the responsibility to make up for what she had done. She went off to rescue her friends even though she was alone, but her positive and courageous spirit was enough to keep her going. Today, people should believe that when they put their mind to something they can achieve what may seem like the impossible.Even though Poppy's courage pushed her to rescue her friends, her friend Branch decided to help her on this crazy mission demonstrating the power of teamwork. Branch is the troll that is always finding ways to protect himself from the Bergens. Whether it's from numerous traps to always moving to another spot, he is constantly living in fear. He made the decision to step up and go off with Poppy in her efforts to save the other trolls. When Poppy and Branch reach the town where the Bergens live, they meet the sweetest Bergen of all named Bridget. The trolls help Bridget the Bergen catch King Gristle Jr.'s attention. In order to do this, Poppy needs the help of everyone who has been locked up by the cook. It isn't easy, but Bridget the Bergen is successfully given a troll makeover where she is dressed with a pink and brown jumpsuit and rainbow hair. Immediately catching King Gristle Jr.'s attention, Bridget goes on a date with him.This movie demonstrates that happiness can be found inside of everyone. Branch is the sad troll that had to witness his whole family being eaten by the Bergens when he was little. He thought that he would never be able to be happy again, but with the help of Poppy he is able to get his color back and start singing again. Queen Poppy also teaches the Bergens that eating a troll is not the only way to find happiness. As Bridget joins King Gristle Jr. on a roller skate and pizza date, they find happiness together. Since the date was so successful, King Gristle Jr. is sad when she has to leave because he's never felt so much joy inside. After the date, Bridget is so happy and cannot believe that the king went on a date with her. At the end of the movie, the Trolls and the Bergens are found singing and dancing together proving that everyone, even previous enemies, can be happy no matter what.This movie should be watched by children of all ages. It teaches youth valuable lessons that can be carried on with them throughout their entire lives. Sometimes people may lack courage, but with a little help from a close friend it may be easier to find it. Teamwork is used throughout our whole lives. From school to work and even sports, working together can make the job easier and even more fun. Happiness can be found inside everyone's heart, but it's just a matter of how we control our emotions and feelings. People can choose to keep that happiness within and display hate or anger instead. All in all, this movie is a fun way to instill important characteristics into a child and should be watched by children of all ages."
74,Trolls,8,16 October 2017,Exactly As Expected,"(Flash Review)These tiny little Trolls are full of gleeful jubilee, smiles and hugs who live carefree lives except for one gigantic fear; the Bergens. The Bergens believe the only way to feel happy is by eating Trolls. The Trolls have recently retreated to a land far from the Bergans. Now the Bergans are sad as a society. One Bergan catches wind of the Trolls location and now their village is in jeopardy. In additional to that storyline, there is one Troll named Branch who refuses to sing, dance or give hugs, which Princess Poppy tries to remedy. Will the Trolls escape the Bergans? Will Branch ever find happiness? There are a few other story lines but overall the story at times of filled with swirling and bursting colors, chases, some decent humor, some moral lessons as well as several singing numbers all of which little kids will enjoy. Young kids may be unnerved by Trolls in peril. Not as deep a story as Toy Story or Inside Out but still a fun movies to enjoy with kids."
75,Trolls,7,4 October 2017,Do you have a shred of inner child?  Or not?,"I am a 70 year old male who spent most of the last two months visiting family including my grandsons-in-law, ages 1 and 3. During the last week, Trolls was on endless rewind from morning until they went to bed. I paid little attention to it until I happened to hear/watch ""True Colors"". Later that day I sat down with the boys and watched it with them.So here I am reading all the IMDb comments on the value or lack there-of in this movie. The low-star crowd, have much to say, pages of words, about its lack of complexity, value, maturity, blah blah blah. I got here by way of looking up Cindi Lauper's song, which happens at the crux of the film, a song that is all about, ""Do you know who you are?"" and ""Do you know that I care?""So all you Burg dwellers, who are you? What do you care about? When was the last time you actually looked at a deep blue sky and multi-shaded clouds or the moon and stars? When was the last time you really listened to someone you care about? Or do you get all your happiness from your fancy car or McMansion? I know, I will rewrite Trolls to be more ""realistic"". That ought to cheer everyone up!Branch arrives a few seconds too late to save Poppy but decides to see if any of the captives are still alive. He arrives a few seconds too late to save them too but stumbles across the king's cape-bauble and frees Creek. The two of them head back and gives the Trolls the sad news. All turn gray and wait to die. But between Branch and Creek (who ""cOhmmmms"" them back to some semblance of self preservation) they all leave the area. Generations pass and the Bergens discover dentistry, skin care and barber shops and are not quite so disgusting looking. But inside they are as clueless and ugly as ever. The old myth about eating trolls fades into obscurity and they never figure out how to be happy on their own. They spread their dirty little town into cities of filth and coal dust to drive their trains and steam cars. They build roads and highways and spread their ""civilization"" to all ends of the planet.In the meantime, the Trolls, still gray, find that if they are quick and clever, they can make a decent living by stealing food and pretty baubles from the Bergens. Before he died of old age, Creek founded a religion, which was just as cynical and self-serving as he secretly was and his priests live off donations from the other Trolls.Just about the time that every square inch of the Bergen planet is covered in asphalt and every inch of sky is obscured by gray clouds of smog and coal dust; every plant dies from lack of sun and water, the seas turn to pink/gray muck from a super bloom of algae and the temperature climbs to 300 degrees which results in everyone and everything dying a horrible death.The EndIt's a kid movie! Get over it! Is it great? Well, it's not Casablanca or The Big Chill or Citizen Kane (Thank Goodness). But yeah, I liked it. And I think that anyone who has a shred of inner child left will like it too. Grownups! Phegh!* * * * * * IMDb. I realize that the following may get me kicked off but...Since my post, I have had a chance to watch my own TV and discover what's going on in the real world. My little attempt at satire is a little to close to comfort. Why am I surprised to find that the Bergens really are in charge and nobody seems to be able or willing to do anything about it? I stand by my original statement.Groan-ups! Phegh! Phegh! Double Phegh!"
76,Trolls,7,12 September 2017,Cuuute!,"This animation from DreamWorks really got me into it! Although I'm not a huge fan of this genre, there is something about this movie I do appreciate: the scenes full of joy and happiness which create a delightful atmosphere, the little trolls who make everyone smile and laugh and, of course, the fact that it has some music into it, which makes it a great musical, also. It's a kid's movie, I admit, but hey, there's plenty of room for others like me and you, who are a bit ""older"" to enjoy it and have fun watching it. So, what are you waiting for? Go see it!"
77,Trolls,3,3 September 2017,Hollywood must believe children have lost their ears and brains,"I just don't know what to think anymore. The only way this movie would be good is if you were on a lot of drugs because then all the colors might look mystifying. Otherwise it was horrid. The voice acting was laughable. I don't get how someone would hire Justin Timberlake again after the Shrek sequel he was in. Apparently, displaying that you're awful at voice acting does not keep you from getting voice acting roles. Yet, he is cringe-inducing again. As he has before, his lines sound like they're being read, not said. The script panders way too obviously. It's pretty much only written to get a LGBT endorsement so that nobody can say it's a bad film or else they will be tarred and feathered in public. Due to this, it loses all artistic credibility instantly and becomes another failed PC bandwagon movie."
78,Trolls,6,29 August 2017,An animation only for kids,"After escaping the infamous Trollstice, a tradition among Bergens which meant eating a troll in order to be happy, the cutesy and happy trolls are once again discovered by their nemesis. As some of them were captured, princess Poppy sets out to rescue them, accompanied by a sad and grumpy Branch which had a troubled childhood.This beautifully animated film depicts the musical adventures of two trolls who attempt to rescue their kind from extinction, while discovering the world and each other's difficult character. It's a very simplistic movie, which seems to be intended only for kids, or at least under 12, because the main characters behave just like them, or in some cases, even like spoiled brats. They are full of colors, dance and joy, leaving the plot and the action way behind. It's extremely predictable and boring, the only thing which saves it from the misery being the animation which is flawless and its music, which seems to be the cure for everything.It is really sad when you see such a film which can be much better that what was achieved here, fall into obscurity because the producers didn't know that even an animation requires a decent plot in order to be good. Even more surprising is the fact that it comes from people who directed Shrek, which simply cannot be compared to this one. It's a below average animation which unfortunately can only be enjoyed by kids."
79,Trolls,7,22 August 2017,Really good fun for kids and adults,"As with some other kids movies especially Frozen, I thought this was going to be a hour and a half of pain and suffering. To my surprise after watching it with my 2 and 4 year old, I was pleasantly surprised at what fun it is. OK not an original story but the pace of the film, bright and good animation with catchy songs puts a smile on your face. For those who are saying they don't get it, lack of plot and seen if all before, I would say; cheer up, life is too short to be a bloody misery. Good clean fun!Ps - might of given it an 8"
80,Trolls,10,5 August 2017,"Dreamworks, you still got it! :D","This film was awesome! I've seen this multiple times after buying it on DVD! This films still remains awesome after watching it over and over again!The music is this movie was really catchy and excellent and the characters were great and the acting and story line was again.... great! This movie is up there with my favorite movie Sing. However, Sing still takes the lead but this doesn't mean that this movie is not great!Overall, this movie was amazing and had great music and.... everything about this was great!10/10"
81,Trolls,10,29 July 2017,My Heart Swelled,"Maybe it was time for this GROWNUP to have a good cry about something important; like love. I have watched this movie three times with my grandson; maybe not ALL of it but most. The music is on point and the message is awesome. I recommend for anyone who wants to laugh, cry and hope."
82,Trolls,10,28 July 2017,Fantastic movie with a wonderful message!!!,"This is by far one of the best animated movies I've ever watched. It is creative, funny, colorful, and above all it has an important message..... happiness lies within! We don't need things (trolls) to make us happy, simple things like dancing, singing, and hugs can make us happy. It's a very moving movie if you think about the real meaning behind the movie. The music is fantastic, me, and my 1 and 3 year old daughters dance throughout the movie in our living room. This movie makes us happy! Thank you Dreamworks Animation!!!!!!!!!"
83,Trolls,4,18 July 2017,"Trolls is a pretty adorable movie, but it has little else going for it.","There's been a weird trend recently of companies making uninspired movies about nostalgic toys: we had Battleship a few years back, and the Transformers series has been a huge hit, so now we've got Trolls. Why is there a movie about brightly colored toys from the '60s? Sure this isn't as bad as The Smurfs, but it's nothing special.Trolls is a simple adventure movie starring the cheery Princess Peppy (Anna Kendrick) and downer Branch (Justin Timberlake). When a group of trolls is captured to be eaten by the evil Bergens, our leads set out to rescue them, and you can guess the rest of the story.Just about everything is bright and adorable, and the plot is punctuated with pop songs that range from Justin Timberlake to Earth, Wind & Fire. There are a couple original songs as well ¬ñ my favorite is written by the duo behind last year's La La Land and Broadway's Dear Evan Hansen ¬ñ and the big show-stopper is without a doubt the ubiquitous ""Can't Stop The Feeling!"".Despite featuring a whole lot of songs, though, Trolls is hardly a good musical. Very little of the music contributes to the story itself, and your enjoyment of the songs will come more from recognizing them than from their quality or what they accomplish for the story and characters. While this can work in another film, Trolls simply isn't strong enough to support itself under threat of its viewers thinking of something else. If you're not pulled in by the bright colors and flashy musical numbers, you'll sit there bored until you notice that you're only about 20 minutes in.It may appear unreasonable for me to care much about the quality of a kids' movie like this, but I want to hold DreamWorks Animation to a higher standard. They have put out some great work; their second film ever, The Prince of Egypt, features some of the best animation that I've seen in a movie, and the How To Train Your Dragon series has provided some of the best reasons for us to continue paying for 3D theater tickets. DreamWorks has been very hit-and-miss lately with their releases, though, and I would call this one a miss. Movies like Trolls, as well as Home from the year before it, just look lazy in comparison to what the studio can make.Overall, Trolls is innocent enough and is a fine movie to put on in front of kids; they'll be entertained by the colorful visuals, and it has a fine enough moral. You won't find much in terms of quality, though, and the movie ends up feeling about as plastic as the toys it is based on."
84,Trolls,7,6 July 2017,Trolls,"Everyone recognises the popular toy Troll dolls created by Thomas Dam, launched in 1959, becoming a fad craze again in the 1980s and 1990s, most popularly as pencil toppers, well it was only a matter of time before they were given a makeover and turned into a movie. Basically Trolls are small creatures living in almost everlasting happiness, singing, dancing and hugging all day, while the large creatures the Bergens can never feel happy, they only discover that devouring a Troll can make them for happy for a moment. The Bergens hold an annual festival, called Trollstice, for all Bergens to gets its feeling of happiness, caging Trolls ready to be eaten, but the Trolls escape through underground tunnels, on the day that Bergen Prince Gristle Jr. would eat his first Troll. Twenty years later, the daughter of troll leader King Peppy (Jeffrey Tambor), the extremely happy and optimistic troll Princess Poppy (Anna Kendrick), throws a big party to celebrate the Trolls' escape, but grey troll Branch (Justin Timberlake), who has a secret crush on Poppy, warns that the loud parties will attract the Bergens. Branch's fears come true when Chef (Christine Baranski), who was banished from Bergen Town all those years ago, sees the Trolls' fireworks, and captures numbers of them, Poppy and others manage to hide, but none of the other Trolls dare to venture into Bergen Town to rescue their friends. Poppy initially goes to save the captured Trolls alone, but a reluctant Branch accompanies her, when they reach Bergen Town, the Bergens are preparing to hold Trollstice that night, they witness Troll hostage Creek (Russell Brand) apparently get eaten by now King Gristle Jr. (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), but Poppy is hopeful he survived. The rest of the Troll captives are being guarded by Bergen scullery maid named Bridget (Zooey Deschanel), who Poppy and Branch discover is in love with Gristle Jr., they strike a deal with her: if she helps to free them and confirm if Creek is alive, they will help her get a date with Gristle Jr. While setting Bridget up for a date, Poppy argues with Branch who refuses to sing, he reveals that as a child he caused his grandmother to be killed after Chef found him because of his singing, he has blamed himself ever since, causing his colour to turn from blue to grey, Poppy comforts him, and Branch reluctantly agrees to help Bridget and the trolls. Using their colourful long hair, the trolls transform and disguise Bridget into Lady Glitter Sparkles, gaining the attention of Gristle Jr., they date at an arcade restaurant and roller rink, he asks her to be his ""plus one"" at Trollstice, and mentions Creek, who is alive and being held captive. Returning to Bridget's room, Bridget asks the Trolls if they can help disguise her as Lady Glitter Sparkles at Trollstice, but make her cry refusing because they can no longer help, the Trolls leave and attempt to rescue Creek. The Trolls are then captured by Chef, they are shocked to discover Creek had agreed with the Bergens to help them capture the rest of the Trolls, in exchange for not being eaten himself, Creek returns to the Troll village and uses a cowbell to bring out the rest of the hiding Trolls to be captured by Chef and the other Bergen cooks. With all the Trolls captured and soon to be eaten, Poppy loses all hope, she and the other Trolls turn grey, but Branch, who has been typically grumpy, sings for Poppy to cheer her up, and through the song confesses his love for her, singing together all the colours of the Trolls are restored, including Branch himself. Bridget is ready to sacrifice herself to save her the Trolls, before they can be served, but Poppy does not want to abandon her Bergen friend, Poppy reveals that Bridget was Lady Glitter Sparkles, and says that Bergens don't need to eat Trolls to be happy, as Bridget and Gristle Jr. found happiness, they all participate in a sing and dance with the Trolls, making them feel happy. Chef refuses to accept the peace, and tries to kill Poppy and Branch, but is sent rolling out of Bergen Town, with Creek, later to be eaten by a giant creature underneath them, while the Trolls and the Bergens agree to live in peace, Poppy is crowned Queen of the Trolls, and she and Branch share a romantic hug. Also starring John Cleese as King Gristle Sr., Gwen Stefani as DJ Suki and James Corden as Biggie. Timberlake and Kendrick are well chosen voicing and singing, as are the supporting cast members, DreamWorks purchased the Trolls brand and turned the Danish creatures into less ugly and more colourful critters, obviously nothing to do with the ones in the Billy Goats Gruff fairytale, the result is a visually scrumptious and upbeat experience, featuring a surprisingly great soundtrack of songs, including the fantastic Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song ""Can't Stop the Feeling"" by Justin Timberlake, a most enjoyable family animated musical adventure. Very good!"
85,Trolls,,26 June 2017,Bergens can only be happy with a little Troll in their stomachs.,"My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. As usual the picture and sound on BD are first-rate.This is basically one long animated cartoon, almost 90 minutes long. It features a number of good singers and voice actors. The story is simple, the Troll village is near the Bergens. If we assume the Bergens are about the size of humans then the Trolls are about the size of a small Canary. The Bergens are perpetually grumpy until Trollstice (like Solstice) when they can catch and eat a Troll. But the Trolls are brightly colored and perpetually happy and in fact do a group hug every hour.When the Trolls get too happy and celebratory, and attract the attention of the Bergins, they have to escape underground but one of their friends gets captured. So most of the rest of the movie has them planning a mission back to the Bergens to bring their friend home before he is eaten.The main happy Troll is played by Anna Kendrick as Poppy, her childlike speaking and singing voice is ideal for this. And grumpy Troll is played by Justin Timberlake as Branch, who had lost his mother because of his singing so now vowed to never sing again. This animated movie is relatively entertaining but quickly forgettable."
86,Trolls,9,25 June 2017,Brings Back Memories To The 1980's Saturday Morning Cartoons,"Back in the 1950's an artist from Belgium named Peyo created those lovable blue-faced whimsical little creatures named The Smurfs. By the 1960's, a Danish woodcarver named Thomas Dam built a wooden doll for his young daughter, which like the Smurfs, would become a cultural icon better known as The Trolls. These cute little peculiar critters with their over-the-top pointy colourful hair have become one of the most popular toys in the 1960's and continued to have exceptional fame in the 1970's and again in the 1990's. It should come as no surprise that these iconic toys would be spawned into a full-length animated feature that inspires you to yearn for Saturday morning cartoons to come back so I can enjoy them with some sugary cereal.In their first animated feature (hopefully not their last) we see these cute little trolls, whose purpose in life is to be happy and spend their days dancing, hugging and singing jovial songs. It truly shows that the animators have taken this film by heart as they made the characters possess a softer, plushy skin complexion as opposed to the hard-plastic I remembered during the 1990's. It was also clever that the animators gave them generic clothing partially because naked trolls would not sit well the sensitive viewers. With the vibrant colours, the spontaneous musical numbers, the caressing and hugging, this will surely attract the younger audience, the adult with the inner child nostalgic for those 1980's cartoons or just anyone having a good time at the movies.Even though their village is permanently marked with glitter and happiness, they are an easy target to a group of unhappy goons known as the Bergens. They believe that the only way they can achieve happiness is if they must eat a Troll at a festival called Trollstice. As Bergen leader Prince Gristle (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is about to indulge in some delightful Troll happiness, the Trolls rebel by evacuating from their homes. Twenty years later, the village of Bergen Town is equally wallowing in misery while the Trolls are in preparation to one of the biggest parties since their escape under the watchful eye of the most ecstatic and whimsical of the Trolls Princess Poppy (Anna Kendrick) not letting anything get in away even from the very pessimistic warnings from the gloomiest of the Trolls, Branch (Justin Timberlake). Their partying catches the attention from a witch-like Bergen named Chef (Christine Baranski) who ends up kidnapping them which lead to Poppy and Branch to go on a rescue mission.What makes this film truly stand out is that it works on plenty of nifty creative ways in its storytelling all the while succeeding in keeping the kids entertained for the next 90 minutes. It was cool that they juxtaposed classic songs like Funky Town and September and doctored it with rap remixes. Even the Bergens get some fun out of the music like Gorillaz' ""Sunshine in a Bag"" and Lionel Richie's ""Hello"". We do some fairy tale subplot involving Bergen scullery maid named Bridget (Zooey Deschanel) who is head-over-heels with Prince Gristle. Rounding out the impressive cast is John Cleese as the Bergen King was a pleasure as always and Russell Brand as hipster like Troll named Creek who later becomes a traitor to them.Sure the message is that happiness is not an outer beauty but an inner beauty is simple, it succeeds without falling victim of being preachy or rubbing it in our faces. And surely enough if you have kids they will have a ball with this movie and the adults will surely recall a time when watching cartoons as kids is truly a sign of our childhood innocence that will remain in our memories forever."
87,Trolls,7,20 June 2017,A fun time with the kids,"YES... even fun for the adults. You'll ind yourself singing along during the movie.Now that its out of theaters, the kids are watching it near every day!An adventure with a lesson- Life is what you make you it! Friends sticking up for friends in the most colorful and musical of ways. LOL.Will leave you with a craving for cotton candy *wink* or a Chia Pet. :)"
88,Trolls,7,17 June 2017,Fun for what it is,"This is a fun little silly kids movie. And it works really good. Again do not set any high bar or standard, just accept this for the animated fun that it is. And you don't even have to be a kid to enjoy it. There is enough for everyone. You shouldn't mind singing too much, though the songs are also very free and with Justin Timberlake at the helm you know you got a hit in the making.I actually knew one song before I had seen the movie. But that's just because it got very popular quickly. It may be the same for you. The story is simple and I wouldn't even really spoil anything, especially because it is very predictable. Just sit back and enjoy if you can and are willing too"
89,Trolls,7,8 June 2017,I was surprised.,"I thought this movie was going to be a snore fest of non-stop stupidity, but I was surprised. It knew what it wanted to do, and it did that very well. It wanted to be a ""feel good"" movie, and it is. It's animation is awesome, very visually interesting and pleasing. There was some very talented voice acting and writing, and at certain times it can get a little dark. And i just love how the ending turned out. It was an ending that could've very well gone wrong, but they did it right."
90,Trolls,5,25 May 2017,Justin Timberlake So Drastically Overshadows Anna Kendrick That You Can't Help Disliking Her Character,"Anna Kendrick's character is an obnoxiously giddy, shallow, empty-headed princess whom I grew to dislike so intensely that, even when she redeemed herself at the VERY END of the movie, I couldn't start liking her. Justin Timberlake's character, whose backstory amazingly requires that he not sing, is the only troll character with a personality and I loved him instantly. Timberlake's character's one featured song (True Colors) was a decidedly one-sided duet with Anna, who was more of a back-up singer than a partner, only singing on her own when the script called for her character to ""speak"" the words in the lyrics to Timberlake's character. Timberlake carries it well though, and the True Colors scene is one of those I find myself replaying on it's own just to listen to him sing it again.Reducing my rating by 5 stars is mostly due to my disappointment in the characters. But overall, this is (as others have said) a brightly colored pop jukebox musical that *mostly* leaves you feeling good (though at the end of the movie, I was still disappointed that Anna Kendrick's character wasn't swallowed up by one of the big fuzzy bugs).I don't watch entertainment movies, especially animated movies that target children, from an intellectual perspective. What's the point of being entertained if you're not willing or able to suspend disbelief AND intellect!? So I don't criticize jukebox musicals the way that some snobbish-sounding reviews do. If they contain songs I love that make my foot move involuntarily to the beat, I'm happy. So most of the credit for the 5 stars I did give goes to the movie's ability to do just that. It has great songs that make you feel good. This is definitely the kind of movie you can put on when you need a little boost in your mood."
91,Trolls,5,21 May 2017,Its a decent movie,i like this movie its an OK movie but not the best movie dreamworks made i think that they can do better but still i liked the story but it felt like a big musical if u want good music go watch south park bigger longer and uncut that is at least a lot better and it has a message thats better.
92,Trolls,5,9 May 2017,Disappointed with the language for a children's movie,"This movie is definitely intended for children. I'm disappointed with the language they insist on using for children's movies. In the first few minutes of the film they say ""Oh my God"". This language is not acceptable in my house, and I don't know why it can't be avoided in children's movies. My young daughter repeats things she hears in movies, as I'm sure a lot of other children do."
93,Trolls,6,8 May 2017,Better than it had any right to be,"If nothing else, ""Trolls"" rally capitalizes on the sweetness of Anna Kendrick' she shares a nice chemistry with Justin Timberlake in the movie, but she also has the pretty singing voice to match. And it's a voice that's right at home with the candy-colored visuals (seriously, it feels like your eyeballs are snorting Pixy Stix).The real surprise is in the story's depth (a kids movie that urges an appreciation for what you have is downright novel, these days), but it's an enjoyable ride throughout. The songs are good, the humor is more hit than miss, and the talent involved is evident. The replay value (for me) doesn't seem all that high, but it's a nice surprise. Considering the tchotchke source material, I don't think anyone was expecting much. If anything.6/10"
94,Trolls,,4 May 2017,Great movie!,"I normally watch a bad or average movie once. If it's good, twice. If it's great, six -seven times. I watched Trolls at least 15 times already and still counting. Don't listen to the bad reviews. This movie is great both for adults and kids. It's musical, positive, cheerful in the most adorable way. Anna and Justin did a great job, the songs are beautiful, they lift you up, guarantee you will finish this movie up and dancing..."
95,Trolls,8,7 April 2017,"""True Colors"" Cupcakes & Rainbows-Singing Dancing & Hugs...What's Not to Like?","Happiness is a Warm Troll according to the ""Bergens"" the Nemesis of the Ever Singing, Dancing, Hugging Trolls. They are the Embodiment of Happy, at least Most of Them.A Troll Named ""Branch"" (Justin Timberlake) is the Exception. He is a ""Prepper"", a Survivalist that Fears that the there is a Bergen Under Every Bush and He has No Time for Partying like ""Poppy"" (Anna Kendrick) and the rest of the Trolls.That's the Set-Up for this Dreamworks Animated Movie. The Trolls have been Spotted In and Out of Pop Culture since around 1958 (created by Thomas Dam as a makeshift Christmas gift for his daughter).This is a Movie with ""True Colors"", to say the least. It Explodes with Color, Sparkle, Glitter, Cupcakes, and Rainbows virtually Non-Stop.While the Troll Camp and the Bergen Village that Bookend the Movie are Generic, but Fun and Repetitive at times, the most Creative of the Three Acts is the Second as our Two Adventurers Travel to the Rescue through Scary Forests and Encounter some Bizarre, Nightmarish, and Funny Creatures.Overall, it's a Low-Concept Movie with a Number of Highlights and can be Enjoyed by All Ages but is Specifically Toned for the Ultra-Young.Its Eye Candy is Impressive, the Jokes Work for the most part, and the Pop Songs (spanning many decades) are Surprisingly quite Acceptable for even Musical Interlude Haters."
96,Trolls,10,16 February 2017,Great Kids Movie!,"We went to the theatre to watch that movie me and my 3year old daughter. We enjoyed the 3D experience. We bought the DVD and we've been watching it over and over since! The songs are very good! The French translation and songs translation is very bad, some songs there's just the music going on without signing loll seriously! We love the remix song of True Colors!!! Its our favourite part. !!!"
97,Trolls,,16 February 2017,"Fun music, needed more character development and plot","It's like Dreamworks sat around a table and said, ""Okay, we want to make a movie centered around Justin Timberlake"" with no thought to actually creating a believable story line and likable characters. (I felt the same way about Home- just exchange JT for Rihanna). Your kids might like this one, but seeing as how we saw Moana less than a month ago and we ALL enjoyed it... Trolls leaves much to be desired. From the strange animation differences between the trolls and the Bergens, to the farting-glitter Troll, to the strange concept of eating a Troll to make you happy...it just didn't come together. The music is fun, probably thanks to JT producing the music."
98,Trolls,10,17 January 2017,Lovely movie for all ages tired of Disney with family deaths,"I love the movie for being original, fun, amazing, funny, spiritual, really loved the songs, the ideas, and the actors. Definitely a movie worth watching at home with your family. Teenagers won't probably like this much, but young ones and their parents will absolutely love it. Considering the fact they're not a Disney fanatic. I actually had to buy the soundtrack album because the songs were so good. Love Justin Timberlake's voice and ability to put his soul into his singing. Now a days movies for adults, like action, comedies, horror, just plain suck. The only kind of excitement I get, or movies that I like, is from kids movies. That is just sad. So sad."
99,Trolls,5,3 November 2016,Trolls - Colourful Animated 'Mess',"This is a Dream-works colourful animated film, a musical based on a small plastic toy with 'wild' hair. Basically the characters are either happy Trolls or miserable Bergans. The Bergans eat Trolls in order to feel happy because Trolls are always happy (is this like a drug?).I knew nothing in advance about this film, but my wife wanted to watch. I think a 6 year old (especially a girl) would love this film, though I'm not completely sure it would hold their attention throughout, I fell asleep briefly half way. I am definitely not the target audience for this film, but I suspected that.I saw the film approx. 8 hours ago and now I can hardly remember anything besides some enjoyable musical scenes, especially good cover versions of 'True Colours' and 'Sound of Silence'.Some tongue in cheek gags for mums and dads to appreciate, maybe a few more would have been good. Trolls may not be terrible but it's just a jumbled 'mess' that hardly made any sense whatsoever."
100,Trolls,8,7 November 2016,For adults with brains between their ears . . .,". . . 20th Century Fox Megacorp offers a panacea antidote to all the shrill voices emanating for the past 18 months from the Fox ""News"" Division. The subtext of the ostensible Kiddie Flick TROLLS is a desperate plea for us to all get along, and pass up the opportunity to kick off the Second American Civil War tomorrow. In TROLLS, Branch--an insecure oddball Troll--represents Donald J. Trump (his hair is a dead giveaway). Fox shows female Trolls as having a light that shines every couple minutes when they wish to have their ""wherevers"" grabbed, but the asocial Branch apparently has a backstory involving a lightning-struck mother, with lots of litigation, or something, so he will not even respond to Troll Princess Poppy (think Melania) when she begins to glow next to him. Branch is wise to worry, because the evil purple-faced ""Bergen"" witch Chef (Crooked Hillary) is trying to bamboozle her fellow Bergens (Bernie Saunders voters) into believing that they will only find happiness in EATING Trolls (that is, the people led by Poppy and Branch). However, Fox tries to cut through all this hate by having a finale in which the Bergens and Trolls dance around singing, ""Oh, the Bergens and the Troll gals should be friends; yes, the Bergens and the Troll gals should be friends"" while the Evil Chef is eaten by Miss Muffet's Tuffet."
101,Trolls,6,22 February 2017,"like the trolls, not the eating","Trolls are happy little singing creatures and Bergens are a large miserable species. The Bergens discovered that eating Trolls gives them happiness. Each year, the Bergens hold a Trollstice festival where they eat Trolls to be happy. It's prince Gristle's first Trollstice but the Trolls escape. Chef (Christine Baranski) is blamed and banished. Twenty years later, Trolls are carefree. Poppy (Anna Kendrick) holds a noisy party while Branch (Justin Timberlake) warns of discovery by the Bergens. They are discovered by Chef and some are taken. Poppy tries to rescue them with reluctant help from Branch. Gristle (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has since become king. His maid Bridget (Zooey Deschanel) secretly has a crush on him.Surprisingly, I like the Trolls. I like their bright colors and penchant for singing pop songs. The Bergens are fine and the lesson to be happy actually works. I do have a problem with eating the Trolls. It's very creepy and ill-fitting for a kids movie. There has to be another way to make the concept less horrific. Maybe they could simply absorb the happy energy leaving the Trolls asleep. It's a hard thing to get over and get comfortable with."
102,Trolls,10,4 November 2016,I have a troll of my own now!,"I honestly believed from trailers that, while this is a big movie in and of itself in a way, that there would be all sorts of interesting animal creatures. It turns out it's mostly about humany/monkey figures. The whole movie is color-effected, it seems. I really like Branch, the troll that made a hideout with a 10-year-supply of food to last him, a secret place where no one can get him. He is a little dim compared to the others color-wise. You know, I think this movie should tickle the child in all of us. People use colors for hypnotic stimulation. People think some generations see color better than others and have had a freer pattern of life and association of generations. I liked the scullery maid, too."
103,Trolls,7,29 October 2016,cute funny adorable and nice soundtracks,"Gotta say that the movie was all exactly what I was hoping for. A cute, funny movie where the Trolls were adorable and the Bergens were your typical villainous creatures trying to eat the Trolls. The movie has got a lot of music and songs and I feel that the main attraction in addition to watch those Trolls were also to hear those songs. The songs were quite varied with a nostalgic song of Hello and True Colours from 1980s or the newer song, especially the real catchy song by Justin Timberlake, Can't Stop the Feeling! which was literally make you cannot stop the feeling of dancing, or move your body a bit or at least hum the song in your heart.The movie has a lot of colors and I believe no violence, hence it is a very safe one for kids to see. For the teens or adults, can enjoy watching the nice bit of romance and also the musics that I said above. I also believe that watching it in 3D would provide better effects as I noticed in various scenes. When the movie was over, you can remain seated for a while as there would be mid post-credit scene that you can enjoy as well.Apart from all those positives, I have to agree with my wife's comments that after seeing the movie, it did not give the feeling of wanting to watch it over and over again. It was fun to watch it during the approximately 1.5 hour film, but that's just about it. Except of course the main soundtrack song that was really catchy. Some of the plots were not really original anyway (kind of reminded a bit like Cinderella story).So if you want to have some fun to forget about your troubles for a while, you can definitely give this one a try and sit back and enjoy it.For my complete review, pls see michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"
104,Trolls,9,23 October 2016,Bloody Brilliant,"Wow. I took my 2 girls (8 & 10) to see this and i would put it up there as one of the best animated films i've ever seen. I knew nothing about it and i booked it at the last minute. My 10 year old thought it was a bit babyish which is understandable but my 8 year old (who doesn't really do the cinema) didn't move for 90 minutes which is unheard of and being full if singing and dancing it was right up her street. I'm 38 and i left the cinema with the biggest smile on my face and have been telling anyone that will listen about it ever since. The trolls just love to sing, dance and hug each other which i think is a great message to the kids that are watching. I'm just gutted i didn't get to watch it in 3D"
105,Trolls,10,23 October 2016,Epic Success!,"I loved it! The part where the trolls help Bridget get a date with King Bristle was adorable! I hated the fact that Creek sold the others out, but it ended with everyone being happy and dancing to ""Can't stop the feeling"" by Justin Timberlake. Loved him in the movie too, glad he got a happy ending! Anyone who loves animated movies with spectacular endings should DEFINITELY watch this! I've loved animated movies from both Disney Pixar and Dreamworks, and honestly, the quality is near identical. All movies are like bits of magic, that everyone should see! The way Poppy helped Branch get happy again and the way Branch comforted Poppy when she was sad by actually SINGING was awesome! It made Branch feel so good that he got his happy colors back! AND everyone else's! It was the most fantastic moment in the movie! I Can't stop the feeling! So just dance, dance, dance!!!!"
106,Trolls,1,25 January 2017,Disturbing and Immature,"Pros: One song is okay if you close your eyes and ignore the movie, during the course of this song the main character is eaten at least 3 times by various plants and monsters. All of this is colorful and ""fun"" of course.Cons: Just because you add rainbows and glitter doesn't mean that it's okay for the main character to be eaten and decapitated in a children's movie.The antagonists are raunchy and immature and eat the protagonists. They are shown eating the protagonists and this is a key plot point. Kids who can pick up on that will not be distracted by the fancy colors.We don't enjoy watching nasty creatures give each other wedgies and kick each others butts while naked trolls fart glitter.Walked out 30 minutes into the movie and even that was too much."
107,Trolls,7,3 March 2017,"Decent, but not the best animated film this year.","This movie wasn't exactly the best movie you'd get from 2016, but then again, it doesn't suck. First of all, the studio blew their budget on Justin Timberlake. Second of all, it is a very goofy movie that relies on scatological humor (like Shrek) and gross-out gags for humor. But then again, it isn't 100% terrible. The animation is good, the songs are well-crafted (especially True Colors) and there are some funny moments. In conclusion, Trolls may not be the BEST animated film this year, but it's not terrible.6.9/10"
108,Trolls,7,28 February 2017,Good but Bad,"In the 1990's were a famous toy line of small Troll dolls with bug-eyes and frizzy colorful hair despite still looking the same in design that still creeps me out today. A decade later DreamWorks Animation Studios said to themselves that this deserves a movie.I have some opinions that i found both good and bad about it, and I may be wrong but it can still count. The movie has it's moments were characters can be funny, annoying, cute...maybe too cute. This movie's animation I love about it with it's fluffy feeling about it that reminds me of walking through a Toys R Us and in a colorful teddy bear aisle.The characters I mostly relate to Branch (Justin Timberlake) with his grouchy attitude, paranoid for danger, and isn't a parting type especially a scene where he throws a guitar in a fire, I snickered. The main character Poppy (Anna Kendrick) is always enthusiastic, creative, and is an amazing singer, despite all those features she still shows emotion that still makes me enjoy them the most.The Story feels like a reminder with a Lord of The Rings like adventure with the two main characters Poppy and Branch attempting to rescue other trolls from ogres that eat them to feel happy, that is sad. The plot still feels like another Dreamworks plot what reminds me of Croods, Puss in Boots, and Madagascar, but still feels good with their execution.Personally I am starting to get sick when it comes to animated children's films that decide to put in new trendy songs like how a teaser for this had the whip song which was a huge insult actually.This movie features some and it's own song ""I got this feeling"" by Justin Timberlake (Voice actor of Branch)The humor can be both annoying and reused throughout the film while some can make me crack up so the comedy is a minimum.Overall, the movie was good with cute and creative characters and animation that i thought was still appreciative by DreamWorks as usual. I would recommend this movie for a quick watch and enjoy the concept of what it brings with the music it brings."
109,Trolls,2,16 February 2017,Why would kids think nightclubs and being eaten alive are fun?,"My five-year old and four-year old did not like this film for several reasons.1) Constant scary creatures trying to eat the Trolls is the only excitement, and it's basically a bit too scary for them.2) Parties which involve DJs, dancing, and disco lights are not parties by my kids' reckoning. That's a party for people between the ages of 15- 25 only. The Trolls were hardcore clubbers. My five-year-old, not so much.3) There were three times my kids laughed. That's not enough. The trailer for Despicable Me 3 had more laughs.4) Nothing *cool* happened expect a Troll hitting a spider in the head with a frying pan. 5) The Trolls were superficial idiots. My kids *got* that and neither is in Year One yet."
110,Trolls,5,2 February 2017,"Sorry to be a 'Troll', but...","Just the other day, I was debating with myself: why don't I enjoy the film Groundhog Day anywhere near as much as I used to? Bill Murray is hilarious, the plot is hugely original, so could my problem be?Then the reason became clear: It's the ending. Isn't Murray far more appealing as the sarcastic, wise-crack jerk he is at the start, than the all-loving, all-generous good Samaritan he is by the movie's close? No wonder I always turn it off twenty minutes from the end when I rewatch it... the dilution of this sardonic icon into a walking, talking Care Bear is too much for my fragile brain to endure.Now we have Trolls, which has a similarly detached individual, in an animated picture full of hugging, dancing, and unbearably cheesy songs (both original, and covers). Guess what? He's the only tolerable one among these big-haired, auto-tuned, singing little munchkins... So, I wonder what'll happen to him...Yep, it's Groundhog Day all over again (pun intended) as sweetness and rainbows are GOOD, and sarcasm and cynicism are BAD. Pur-lease. The same tragic brainwashing even befalls to a group of fierce ogres, who have their nice, metropolitan cityscape transformed into a garish, multi-coloured nightmare. I hope they have sunglasses for when they wake up every morning.So, the upshot is: You can keep your glitter-pooping trolls and your break-dancing ogres, I'll stick with the REAL interpretation of those monsters e.g The ones that live under the bridge, and the ones that'll break your bones to make their bread. Or, something. If that means I walk about with a raincloud over my head forever, so be it. Far more preferable than being a happy-clappy, hippy conformist, any day. I'm off to change my surname to 'Meldrew'. Ciao! ;) 5/10"
111,Trolls,,22 January 2017,A contagiously happy film,"This animation tells the imaginary story, where tiny trolls live very happy lives. They get hunted down by unhappy giants called Bergens, and these Bergens believe that they can only become happy after eating a troll.There can hardly be a happier film than ""Trolls""! The palette is super bright and colourful, which brings out happiness in people already! Then, the constant singing of popular songs augments the feel good factor. The cute and cuddly characters bursts into spontaneous dances and giving each other hugs. It just emanates fun, joy and bliss. The plot is simple, but effective in delivering happiness. I enjoyed watching it."
112,Trolls,10,10 January 2017,Great movie for kids.,"It absolutely sickens me for grown adults to rate this movie solely based off what they think. It's an animated movie geared forwards kids, and mine absolutely love it. It's a musical which you would expect since Justin Timeberlake and Annna Kendrick are the 2 leads. Every now and then, a somewhat sexual innuendo will pop up but honestly it took me a few times to watch it in order to catch them. While I may be sick of, simply because my 3 year old refuses to watch anything else, it's actually a cute little movie and keeps the kids entertained. I recommend parents show this their children and just hope they don't get as addicted to it as mine have."
113,Trolls,7,5 January 2017,Family fun,"Trolls is not the best animated movie out there, nor the most original plot out there, nor has the most outrageous characters out there. However, Trolls is family fun and has both fun and heart. The main thing is that the movie doesn't pretend to be anything or take itself seriously.The message is simple but powerful: there is always a reason to smile and be happy, even in the saddest moments you can find a glimpse of light to lift you up. Some people are grumpy because they are sad inside. Your people is important, so you care for and take care of them.The movie is gorgeous regarding coloring and texturing.The characters are likable, albeit a bit simplistic. Not original because, well, these trolls have been around since I was a kid, some decades ago.Some of the scenes are very funny! There is adventure, comedy, cheekiness, music, funny villains, dancing, singing, farting, some tears, and what's not.The music is lovely and uplifting. Justin Timberlake has done at great job at selecting the music score and composing the main theme of the film. Both Timberlake and Kendrick are lovely in their respective roles.I watched this movie during one of those cry sessions where the cinema is full of kids. Most small children didn't get the jokes in the story, so I think that the movie is suited for 6y.o+ and adults. Most adults there had a ball and laughed as much or more as their kids.To be completely fair, this is one of those movies that you can grab in DVD or BR and watch it at home if you have a tight budget and need to prioritize what you see in the cinema."
114,Trolls,10,31 December 2016,Great Movie for Kids and Adults,"When I was growing up, all you would see were Disney movies full of songs and while there was the odd good song, often it was just twenty minutes of rubbish music for the rest of the cartoon.Now ever since Pixar took over, the singing stopped or greatly decreased(thank god!) So seeing a movie full of song again, i was apprehensive.The good news is, there is something in it for adults too. Its an endearing movie with lots of classics from 70s and 80s. I loved it, my husband loved it(though not so much on tenth watch) and my two girls (5 and 2) love it.Its been a while since I enjoyed a cartoon as much, probably UP was the last one."
115,Trolls,8,23 December 2016,Worth every penny,"If you are not sure whether you like this or don't like this, then please crawl back under that rock you crawled out of and find your spine.This is a Merry Poppins type movie with trolls - not just entertaining but morally educational too, for children and adults alike. It's just a great watch. The idea is original, the singing and music are uplifting, and the plot is great.Money well spent to watch this on the big screen and money well spent for the DVD. It's refreshing and it's one of those movies you can watch a few times without getting bored of it.This movie deserves a better rating. Everyone involved in making this movie deserves an Oscar. Full stop."
116,Trolls,6,22 December 2016,Pretty good for a kids movie,"Surprisingly good! I had really low expectations for this movie as it really did look like it was going to be an extremely generic 'kids flick designed solely for entertaining your children for an hour' in trailers. And to some extent, yeah, it was- but it offered some extremely original visuals. If you're a person who appreciates good design, this movie had a surprisingly unique aesthetic, giving everything a fabric effect and using creative ways to turn it into a visually pleasing and colourful world. It was also surprisingly funny. A few predictable jokes, but otherwise some clever stuff. I found myself laughing out loud a few times.The plot was extremely predictable, however, and the songs got a little annoying in places. It's no masterpiece by any long shot, but it's good. Might be a little difficult for young boys to get on board with, but it's an easy hit for girls, and adults might enjoy it a little too. At least, more-so than being made to watch your usual generic stuff like the Tinker Bell or Minions movies."
117,Trolls,10,6 December 2016,"Best of the little kids movies (Disney, Nick, etc.)","My kids (son and daughter) both LOVED this movie. Finding Dory was cute, but my kids lost interest midway through the movie because the Disney movies tend to have boring moments. Trolls was different!!This was very interesting throughout its entirety. My kids were engaged, and so were other kids in the theater. Every kid started to dance when the songs came on, and even I wanted to dance because I knew the songs too. Very smart to use songs that appeal to both adults and kids. I liked the underlining message from the movie, and loved the colors too! Justin and Anna did a great job with Poppy and Branch. We can't wait to own the movie because it was that good. Honestly, we can't wait for a Trolls 2, so I hope that was already mentioned. :)!!!!!"
118,Trolls,10,27 November 2016,All Cupcakes and Rainbows!,"Took my 7 year old niece and expected it to be another boring kid's movie. This movie was fun, entertaining and had a decent story line too.Sort of like Cinderella with a modern twist but don't be fooled. There are many hidden messages adults will find quite deep and meaningful.But of course, you have to like music, singing and hugs because this is the basic premise of troll happiness. Which is really a metaphor for life.Trolls teaches children and adults what happens when we look outside ourselves for true happiness. It teaches us the difference between ""fake"" inner peace and true self acceptance.It also show us what happens when we choose to focus on what we lack rather than what we can appreciate in the moment.Of course it's all cupcakes and rainbows, so what? Trolls show us what happens when we decide to look at the world through a drab dreary grey lens. It gets depressing and boring. Sound familiar?I personally would rather live in a troll world where singing, dancing and hugs are the key to happiness, abundance and bliss. I guess we were the lucky ones! We shared a great theatre experience where all patrons were singing, swaying and doing a little toe tapping as the end credits rolled by. Children and inner children will love this movie! Highly recommended to kick off the holiday season."
119,Trolls,7,20 November 2016,"""True happiness is a lot closer than you think.""","Surrounded by four kids and their Moms, this guy got shanghaied into seeing the flick as a birthday excursion for my eight year old granddaughter. The bonus by the way for being eight these days is no more car seats! Anyway, it was a fun afternoon, as the kids enjoyed themselves with their over-sized bucket of popcorn. The movie is certainly colorful, with a somewhat Cinderella flavor to it with the story of Bridget and her infatuation with Bergen King Gristle. Helping advance the cause is the eternally optimistic Troll Princess Poppy who's goal starts out as a rescue mission for the kidnapped Creek, surreptitiously hidden in Gristle's amulet. The 'true happiness' tome comes into play any number of times, but definitely as a cure for Troll Branch's malady, having lost his grandma once upon a time to an enemy Bergen. In all my years of troll lore, I've never come across a reference to a Bergen, so I don't know if that was made up for the picture or not, but I guess they had to come up with something for the bad guys. There's lots of cute stuff interjected into the story with things like the summer 'trollstice' and Lady Glitter Sparkle, and I had to chuckle at one point when I wanted to blurt out to Poppy - 'More cowbell'!"
120,Trolls,7,17 November 2016,"that it's colorful is one thing, but it's funny too and has a good (if not groundbreaking) message","Maybe it was because this has been one of the worst weeks of my life; maybe it was because I missed seeing creatures, even if they were CGI animated creations from Dreamworks, that were out of Jim Henson's creature shop (one could say that the mix of very tiny and cute mixed with a fantsy quest that involves some magical overtones has hints of Fraggle Rock and Labyrinth); maybe it was because I needed some silly pop song renditions by a bunch of overly cute, rainbow-psychedelically colored thing. Whatever it was, Trolls actually did it for me, up to a point. As an adult it was delightful and cheerful, and for kids I can guess it's like getting a bowl of the most awesome tasty scrumdidliumtous cereal of the day: it'll taste great and surgary for now, and then later it'll be time to eat vegetables.It's not that I don't have criticisms of it as a movie, I know I do: the pacing near the end gets extremely lax - there's no real final big blow-out against the villain, it's borderline a cop-out because, frankly, how would we buy all of these tiny trolls defeating this bad witch of a villain (not the goblin king, who's a likable dunce, but the woman at her ear trying to get him to have ""Trollstice"" so all the trolls in the kingdom can be eaten for the sake of 'happiness') outside of the power of jubilant and over the top singing of a recent pop hit (in this case that earworm ""Dance Dance Dance"" or whatever it's called). And at other points, like a convenient moment a character goes turncoat to do that ratting-out-the-good-guys part that has been seen in countless movies, the filmmakers go into formula.But what's successful to me about this is the energy, the color, the total glee and joy that is apparent with these filmmakers (and don't forget what Truffaut said, that it's crucial to see either total joy or pain when seeing what the creative process must have been like), and I think that these creators set out to make a silly-smart musical comedy and succeeded. You might get some deep lesson from it about why it's important to be happy, and to that end I'm sure it'll never be as strong as something like Inside Out, which is also about emotional fulfillment and goes into terrain that pushes expectations by embracing sadness. This doesn't do that so much, though at the least it does acknowledge that trolls like the main guy troll Branch (the one voiced by Timberlake) should understandably feel sad and betrayed by the world they're in if total shock and tragedy comes upon them.I think it may also be a law of low expectations, which I had going in. I was simply hoping to get some vibrant colors and maybe some good voice work. What I got was more than that in the writing, which was very quick and clever and got in with a good joke or line or reaction from a character and didn't stay too long, and the animations in the songs is wildly creative and matches the jubilant tone of the movie: when the main girl Troll Poppy (Kendrick, duh) sings her first song when going on the quest to save the other trolls, the animators keep changing things up and moving along the story (somewhat) and by adding jokes it certainly never makes things dull. And I liked the whole part of the story with the lowly servant goblin girl who has a quasi-kinda-sorta Cinderella thing, only here it actually makes more sense than (dare I say) an actual Cinderella story usually does.But most of all, it's funny, and not just a 'oh that's cute' way, but in the way that set ups and pay-offs and genuinely clever, snappy dialog can get laughs from me. So if you got a kid or are a kid, this is not high art, but you'll watch it about 50 times. And if you're an adult, you might find yourself watching it with them, maybe more than the requisite once to get them to be quiet. This was a fun trip!"
121,Trolls,6,12 November 2016,Trollin' towards happiness,"""Trolls"" is exactly what the title says: a film about trolls, namely the little toy figures that have been really popular for quite a while now. So if there is anything surprising about this film, then it is how long it took to finally be made. But now is the time, in 2016. The makers (quite a few) have a great deal of experience when it comes to animation filmmaking as they worked on stuff like Shrek, Spongebob, Kung Fu Panda or Madagascar in the past already. And their collaboration here results in another mentionable achievement that adds quality to their body of work. The comedy works for the most part and the drama and emotion sometimes does as well, drama for example is really great at the moment the troll colors change and we hear the male ""hero"" sing again for the first time. In my opinion, the latter is really the crucial factor to determine nowadays how good and worth watching an animated film can be considered. Comedy and animation are at such a high level these days at animated films that these areas can almost be taken for granted, even if they maybe shouldn't and we could be more grateful for the quality we get there.Anyway, the heroes here are Poppy and Branch, voices by Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake. There are more known names in the voice cast here, but I will not mention these as you can check them out in the cast list yourself. Anyway, mentioning these two already tells you that there is a big musical component in here and yes, there are several music numbers included from start to finish, certainly more than you usually get in an animated film and singing being a crucial component of troll life is depicted this way. But it is not just about the trolls, it is also about their enemies and (unsurprisingly!) we find out they are not as evil as they may appear initially. The chef turns into the main antagonist and we don't feel sorry for her banishment early on because of what she does. And the old king has also died already and it is times for the new one to prove himself and define himself in terms of who he is. Yes this is a fairly predictable film, but thanks to the colorful characters and smart witty fun scenes (like a Cinderella reference), it's not really a problem that you will not really be surprised at all watching this one. One example would be the male main character showing up the very first time when the female is captured by a bunch of spiders and it was so so clear that he would shop up exactly then. So clear that the writers almost made a joke about it themselves by letting the troll girl say afterward that she also knew he would come.It is one of the better animated films of the year I would say, but maybe not one of the best. I watched the German dubbed version and I must say I was not really impressed by the music and songs performed in there. It felt somewhat estranged from the rest of it. And also in terms of comedy and drama there are weaknesses. Drama one example would be the story about the male troll's grandmother that felt so rushed in and ineffective although it really could have made an emotional impact. Comedy one example would be a cloud character that only delivered comedic purpose, but was never as funny as he could have been and disappeared as fast as he appeared too. Twice, actually. I would have liked to find out more about him or instead just would have preferred entirely without him. Butg these are just minor criticisms. I think overall the good easily outweighs the bad and this film is worth seeing. And with that I do not only refer to very young audiences, as the main characters imply. I also refer to grown-ups as the movie clearly has a great deal of depth on some occasions. And it was also done better with the other troll characters. They also may have very little screen-time and we don't know too much about them, but it makes sense they are there and it makes sense that they are shown when they are shown.Overall, I enjoyed the watch here and I have no problem saying that this is among the better animated films I have seen this year, even if it's certainly not a contender for best (""Zootopia"" at this point still). This work is another example of how strong animated films are at this point, in terms of quality and despite the strong quantity as well, it is (almost) always worth checking these out. Looking at the cast list, it also shows that it's easy to get big stars for projects like these because of how successful they turn out to be, also (or especially) from a commercial perspective. I enjoyed ""Trolls"" and it's not difficult for me to call it a success that definitely deserves all the awards attention coming its way as I believe it was quite a challenge to make the characters and story appealing for audiences of all ages, more than usual for the animated genre, and boy did they succeed. Go see it! I would also watch a sequel and looking at the films I mentioned earlier that the men in charge worked on previously, it would not be a surprise at all if we get one in the next five years."
122,Trolls,6,8 November 2016,"Though it's story is like most DreamWorks movies, Trolls is entertaining with fun songs and an animation style that's unique","You know those little dolls with the long hair that shot straight up? Those were the toll dolls (or action figures if you were a boy) and they've remained a staple for most children. Their small design and many options for clothing made them a hit and were probably more recognizable then Barbie as they were more fantasy-like then the regular dolls. I think I might have had one when I was six (I eventually found a naked troll sitting in a box of old toys I was donating to Goodwill), but they never had an impact on me like the toys of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Spider-Man.I haven't seen the troll toys in years, and only when DreamWorks Animation announced that they wanted to make a movie out of them that they came back in my mind. Like a lot of other movies based on toys (Transformers, G.I. Joe, Battleship), this is clearly a cash grab. Or at least I would have thought that until I saw The Lego Movie, which I still see as one of he great comedies of the decade. If the right people can get behind a product they have passion for, then maybe a Trolls movie could work. In a fantasy world of some sort, the trolls are little creatures that live in a constant state of happiness, while the larger ogre-like beings, the Bergens, eat them as they have no happiness and think that doing so will give them that same feeling. After years of living in a tree where the Bergens hold an annual dinner feast, King Peppy (played by Jeffrey Tambor) leads the trolls to escape through underground tunnels. Cut to ten years later where King Peppy is about to step down and lead his daughter Princess Poppy (played by Anna Kendrick) into ascending the throne.Poppy loves to lead the trolls into constant song and dance to ensure their happiness. Despite the overly upbeat attitudes of trolls like Creek (played by Russell Brand), Biggie (played by James Corden), and DJ Suki (played by Gwen Stefani), the one troll who hates the constant parties and hugs is Branch (played by Justin Timberlake). One day, a party that Poppy throws proves too loud as exiled Bergin, Chef (played by Christine Baranski) finds them and captures a good chunk of the little people, hoping to restart the tradition. Branch and Peppy go on a journey to rescue their friends and help to see if the Bergins can find happiness another way.Based on this summery and the majority of the trailers, you would think that Trolls would be nothing more then cinematic junk food. While it is in some area, I was surprised by how much I liked this. Both Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake make for both a comedic team and a nice sounding duo when their required to sing. Speaking of which, the songs, with half being original and the other half being pop songs, are entertaining and seem to fit then context of the story when needed.The animation is cool, as the whole thing looks like an arts and crafts world. This allows Trolls a look that's totally it's own thing. I rarely see that in a movie (Tron, Sin City, and 300 are some other examples) where you could identify it from one picture.The story, while well meaning, is unfortunately clunky and follows the same road story that DreamWorks seems to be repeating all the time. It's not that it's bad, and the beginning and ending are nice; it's just that a lot of the middle seem to have character reveals and emotional cues that seem to be of the benefit of the movie rather then what would have happened. The best thing about the plot, which I won't spoil, does manage to make the Bergens sympathetic, as it would have been easy to make them standard villains. I can't help but think that this was meant to be an analogy on anti-bullying.I'll give this six troll dolls out of ten. Trolls grew on me finding a happy place, even if it can feel forced. There are better things that your child could be watching from this year (Zootopia, Kubo and the Two Strings, Pete's Dragon, Finding Dory), but this is harmless and I don't see why not to see this if they want to. If Home was a failed attempt at a story just for kids, this serves as a better pass. Perhaps some parents that watch this might find a bit of happiness."
123,Trolls,5,25 February 2017,Far too sweet. makes it weak.,"So I did not realize that trolls are still popular. I remember all the Tweens had at least one back when I was in jr. High a long time ago, but now I can see from this movie how diverse the toy line has gotten, in their plot to sell them to the masses.This movie shoves so much sugar into my throat I thought my teeth were going to rot. It's like some one just poured a big bag of it into some Kool Aid and you have to ask yourself do you like Kool Aid or the big sugar rush you just got?And by sugar, I'm talking about the parade of pop songs. The music is good, how could in not be when you got Justin Timberlake singing. Ana Kendrick is pretty good too starting us out off the bat with two original songs (possibly the only two)the film produces.The animation is really, really, I mean really colorful. Blindingly colorful once again used as fluff to sugarcoat the fact that the movie really has no substance.It's kinda insulting the lack of actual effort I'm getting from this animation.I'm not really into musicals but my mind is an open book. Trolls did nothing to change my mind on the musical. The songs are really good but I got little from it. Most likely because the film also uses some stock classics with very few original songs. I kinda hate it when musicals do that. Stop taking other people's songs and write your own for the movie.Hearing Timberlake and Kendrick duet off of True colors was beautiful, but would be just as satisfying hearing them do it on a soundtrack versus watching their voices come out of the Trolls.Just a little too pop perfect."
124,Trolls,5,1 February 2017,"Fun in a few moments, but in the end is a tedious animation and a very weak pace.","Trolls is an animated musical, well I do not really like musical, Along with romance is the genre that I least like, the animation is well Done, but I found it very colorful, that was even giving a headache in Me, the characters are fun, but everyone is forgettable, the Soundtrack is good, the song that was nominated for the Oscar of Best Original song is good, has cool moments, more I found the fact To have a lot of music, hurt the script and the rhythm of the movie, I think A lot of children would be disappointed watching this animation, I found the Worse than I imagined, Trolls is a very weak film with a Soundtrack that is the best point of the film, and a few moments Fun, more is not quite top 10 animations of the year. Note 5.0"
125,Trolls,9,25 November 2016,The Happiness is in the Music!,"The Trolls in this film are not ugly like the dashboard ones of the 80's. Instead they are endearing, cute, and presented in vibrant colors. The powerful colors reminded me of those in Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2. Vibrant colors help to deliver a message of happiness and finding it in yourself and through love. This film can be enjoyed by anyone but those around the toddler age will certainly be playing over and over, singing and dancing to the music.If you get into upbeat music, you'll like the movie. If you like cute animation with a decent story, you'll love this film.The main idea of this film is that we all have happiness inside us. The ugly creatures have to eat Trolls in order to be happy and obviously, this doesn't go well with them. Through a random course of events, the Trolls have to show the ugly creatures they can be happy on their own and in fact, the happiness was inside them all along.The music is powerful and makes this movie a better animation film than others. You have the music and voices of Justin Timberlake, Zoe Deschanel, Anna Kendrick, and more. Supporting the music is amazing animation in a colorful style we haven't seen ¬Ö ever before I think it's safe to say. It's a feast for the eyes and ears. The story is also very cute which makes it all the more suited for the younger ones.I'd recommend this film for everyone who likes the elements I have mentioned but especially kids ages 4-9. If you're like me you may find you are a kid at heart because I really loved this film. Because it won't be for everyone, it lost just 1/2 a star."
126,Trolls,6,20 November 2016,"Don't get excited Pixar fanboys, this isn't the epic stinker you were praying for.","Yeah, we all expected this movie to be terrible. In fact, the only people who seemed excited for this movie were the annoying Pixar fanboys cheering for this movie to deliver a nail into the coffin of DreamWorks.Well, sorry Pixar fanboys, this is not the nail in the coffin you were praying for. Actually, much like the Angry Birds movie, it's surprisingly good.No, the story and characters are nothing to write home about. But the key is that the movie is fully aware of such. Unlike the average Pixar film, which seems to think it is being highly original as it plows through the exact same crap as all of its predecessors over and over again (which they only get away with because of the aforementioned psychotic fanboys), Trolls knows you have heard this story before and spends only a minimal amount of time boring you with the retelling of it.So while it's easy to recognize that this is definitely not a good movie, it is, much like Angry Birds, still an enjoyable movie.Sorry Pixar fanboys. You'll have to wait another year to dance on the DreamWorks grave."
127,Trolls,1,11 February 2017,To Troll or Not to Troll,"The only reason I can think anyone would rate this anything but zero (or one star, in IMDb) is for trolling purposes, i.e., to induce other people that haven't utterly and completely wasted their time to go and waste it.The upside (yes, it has an up side, that's why it manages to not be the worst film I've ever seen) is that it DOESN'T have original songs (or, so says my wife, which recognised most of the songs). Take Disney's ""Moana"", for example, all original songs, and all either annoying or unfitting. This film managed to fit several known songs in the context of the story, including Cyndi Lauper's ""True Colors"" (the only song I recognised), what absolutely doesn't mean the songs were not annoying (yeah, I like ""True Colors"", but then again, who doesn't?)The story is a wild exploitation of the Cinderella tale, mixed up with the Smurfs cartoons and ""Xanadu"", the musical film, and generally doesn't make much sense, altogether.The ending is made obvious in the first few minutes, when the soon-to-be first-and-only love of the then child spoiled prince appears on screen as a faded servant in the castle.The story is very straight forward, with an unimportant twist of making one extremely unimportant character turn on his friends for his unimportant life (it could've been any other character, it wouldn't make any difference, maybe it could have made the twist more ""twisty"" if it had been a more significant character, but then again, what for?)Not being a Disney film, two characters actually seem to die in flames, although that's not explicitly shown, but I felt better thinking the circumstanced villains were gruesomely dead, burned alive, to never return in ""Trolls 2"".The film ends literally where it starts, on the tree of the trolls, in the city of their foes. Citing Grug (The Croods), it's a long and sucky walk, in a circle. There wasn't a single laugh (or even a chuckle, or a smirk) during the whole film, or thrills, or emotions, other than boredom and an actual sense of shame for being watching it (except for ""True Colors"", which amazingly fits on the scene and in the plot).I really don't understand why this film was produced. Just to sell some toys?! I can't believe people would spend money doing that!"
128,Trolls,1,21 June 2017,Barely a movie,This movie is so fundamentally terrible it makes me want to rip off my foot and beat myself to death with it. I understand that this is a kids movie but that is no excuse for the complete lack of story or decently written dialogue or the disgusting art style that makes my eyes want to vomit. The soundtrack alone is enough to render john Williams unconscious. This movie is total garbage and painfully unfunny at times. I would recommend using the $10 you saved by not buying this movie from the bargain bin at Walmart to buy me some toothpicks that I could use to tear out the part of my brain that remembers this dsteaming pile of cat feces.
129,Trolls,4,8 May 2017,"An annoying, overly bright, and unfunny movie.","Have you seen one of those television¬†shows that shows¬†a parody of a kids show?¬†You know, the parodies that show¬†only happiness, overly bright colors and obnoxious characters? Luckily, you only watch only about ten seconds of that, but try imagining watching an hour and half of that. It sounds painful¬†and trust me, it is because that was a¬†description of ""Trolls"" in a nutshell.¬†This film is¬†overly obnoxious,¬†unimaginative and so annoying that I was really considered to stop watching the movie. However, I managed to get through it somehow. It was a very unpleasant watch and I still don't know how I did it, but I succeeded. Do you want to know how bad this film is? Well, I'll tell you.The story focuses on some creatures known as the trolls who are happy all year long¬†and do nothing but sing, dance, and hug every single day. They hide from very grumpy¬†creatures called the bergen, who used to eat a troll every single year so they can experience happiness which they never experience. One day though, the former Chef Bergen (Christine Baranski) finds the Trolls and captures most of them so she can bring them to the King of Bergen Town, Gristle¬†(Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who has never experience happiness in his life. Shocked by the capture of her friends, the happy-go-lucky¬†princess of the trolls, Poppy (Anna Kendrick) teams up with a stick in the mud troll named Branch (Justin Timberlake) to go rescue her friends. And that's it. You can probably guess the story from there.The story is one of the major problems with the movie. It's not only predictable, but also unoriginal as we have seen the story of a happy-go-lucky character team up with a stick in the mud character many times before in the past, with some movies doing the story much better. The characters are also obnoxious. The two main characters are both heavily unlikable. Poppy is so obnoxiously annoying for being happy-go-lucky throughout the majority of the movie and not really having anything funny to say or do. Branch on the hand, is unlikable for being a jerk constantly. He doesn't really have a personality other than being a jerk and the reason for him being this way is so ridiculous that I actually burst out laughing because I thought it was so stupid. That was the only laugh I actually got from the movie, but not for the right reasons. I forgot to mention that the movie was a jukebox musical. It doesn't sound that bad, I mean it does have some pretty good songs like ""September"" by Earth, Wind, and Fire, but trust me,¬†they're not pleasant to the ears. The songs are glossed with auto-tune which is the very definition of ear poison. Not only is it horrible to listen to, but it also wastes actual¬†singing talents like Anna Kendrick who we have seen sing rather well in movies like ""Pitch Perfect."" So, after all my complaints is there anything good in this movie? Well, I can name a few things. The animation is great. Even though it did become irritating after awhile for being to bright and colorful throughout the whole movie with nothing dark in it whatsoever. it looks like actually objects you usually use when you make a scrapbook reminding a lot of those Nintendo yarn games like ""Kirby's Epic Yarn'. I also did like two of the characters in the movie. I enjoyed the characters of King Gristle and Bridget (Zooey Deschanel) and I also like their romance subplot that they had. Even though, it was basically a rehashed version of Cinderella, I thought it was cute.Other than that, ""Trolls"" was a pretty painful movie to watch. It was so bright, so annoying and so obnoxious that I'm baffled that DreamWorks thought it was suitable for a wide release. I don't know what else to say about this film, it's just bad. Now I'm going to rest my eyes for now so I'll be able to review my next movie. I'm just happy I didn't bleach them."
130,Trolls,3,6 May 2017,I didn't like it,"The only reason I saw this movie is because my friend took me to the movie theater and I hardly ever get to go so it was a special treat for me. I asked her what movie we were seeing and she said Trolls.I already had a feeling I wasn't going to like this movie, but I thought I might give it a shot.The plot is pretty dumb. It's about these trolls that sing and dance all the time and hide from ogres to avoid being eaten. Pretty basic and simple and dumb plot. This movie was also trying WAY TOO HARD to be funny. I didn't have a real laugh once. I might have forced some fake laughs but that's about it. I couldn't stand the jokes. That cloud guy was extremely stupid. It was a stupid character that had legs and and wore socks but no shoes. It is just pure garbage! And I can't stand the troll that has sparkles come out of its butt! Honestly, most of the jokes are just annoying and not funny. What are they trying to put in kids heads?I know its intended for little kids, but I'm imagining myself watching this as a little kid, and I'm still not liking it.I only gave it 4 stars because I kind of liked the little love story between the king ogre and the servant ogre. I also didn't mind the main character she is the one that make the movie watchable."
131,Trolls,5,17 April 2017,"cute, but unoriginal","I enjoyed the animation this movie delivers, but was disappointed with the lack of originality.the Trolls themselves were someone else's creation; I recognized parts of the background music from an original soundtrack created by Trent Reznor for another the movie, The Social Network's row boat scene; all the songs the trolls sang were popular hits.this movie was just a conglomeration of other people's original work; why couldn't they put in, at least, one original song?"
132,Trolls,3,11 March 2017,"Colors can't hide a lack of humor, originality, and an overabundance of pandering","So, let me tell you about a film called Trolls. It was released in 2016, and not a single person I knew was excited, or even wanted, to see the darned thing. To me personally, it looked bizarre. A strange mix of bright, cheerful colors, and music that gets allot of radio play so people will praise the soundtrack as being good or something along those lines. Before I tell you my thoughts on this film, let me ask you a few questions: Do you laugh when people say things that are hip nowadays? Do you think those jokes will be timeless? Are you a sucker for the most pandering films and what have you not? If you said yes to those, you've probably already seen Trolls, but if you haven't, then you're probably better off not listening to what I have to say. Trolls is not a good film in my opinion. The animation is lovely, the colors are nice, and there's an upbeat mood to it... but I'm not buying it. Trolls is one of the most pandering films I've seen in a while, using songs you probably know, from artists you probably know, phrases like 'burned' that are considered hip these days, and a failed attempt at a meta-humor style (which has become quite popular, even though it's actually hard to pull it off successfully) that the writers will do anything to try to cover up.The plot itself is quite boring and predictable. These evil beings (supposedly) kidnap small cute things, one of those evil beings isn't too evil after all, and then the cute things convince the evil things into not being evil after all... because kids movie. This plot structure, even without the small cute things, has been done a million times before, and this is nothing new. To add in a little spice, they add in a brief moment where all the characters get sentimental, but this brief moment means almost nothing because the characters are almost immediately healed again. This doesn't work for the following reason which I will explain: the major downer guy spends years upset and gray, won't listen to any music, and has a low chance of being healed. When all of the other trolls become like him... guess what? They become happy again, completely disregarding any sort of logical and sound set-up before this very moment.There are also quite allot of Deus Ex Machina moments here... but not just that, poorly timed Deus Ex Machina moments! For example: the trolls can mess with their hair in a way that can get them out of sticky situations. When they're captured... only ONE troll does this at the LAST second possible. If the writers hadn't been so lazy and used the troll's abilities when they should have been used, the movie would have ended rather shortly... or, god forbid, had the brilliance to subvert your expectations and keep on going... which, with the poorly timed Deus Ex Machinas', it doesn't do anyways.This film also tries to be a musical... but does so without allot of original music that musicals actually have. I heard a poor rendition of Junior Senior's 'Move Your Feet', a so-so rendition of Adelle's 'Hello', and a rendition of that one song you heard non-stop on the radio last year... which was also nominated for an Oscar. Out of the entirety of this film's running time, I heard ONE original piece, and to be honest, I didn't hate it. It had an upbeat feel to it, but at the same time, felt like it belonged to another film because it wasn't pandering and was wholly original. For a musical, Trolls has a lack of music, original or old, and that's a stinker. I don't hate musicals, and when done right, they work. A good example of a movie that didn't need to be a musical but worked as one anyways is South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut because you can tell that they tried to do something that was fresh. While South Park is far too inappropriate for anyone's kids to watch, I would rather watch a kid friendly version of that film because it would still be 10 times more fresh, original, and fun than Trolls.In conclusion, Trolls is nothing new. You're not missing out on anything if you pass on it, as there will be other, much similar, films that your kids will enjoy... and you might, too! While I said the word 'pandering' allot, another word that fits well within the reaches of my criticism towards this film is 'rushed'. It feels rushed because it stopped dead in it's tracks after it was bold enough to a do a wholly original song that wasn't done in coalition with the film to boost sales of an album or song. It feels rushed because allot of it's humor felt forced, and not clever enough to warrant using phrases that are common today, as-old-as-a-basement tomorrow. If you like this film, then I don't hate you, go see the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th reincarnation of this film that they are bound to do because it was, most likely, a success for them. I just hope that the writing will be more clever and the musical part will be improved upon in any sort of sequel they attempt to do."
133,Trolls,1,2 March 2017,Garbage,"It disappoints even the lowest expectations. Has absolutely no value and seems like a poor attempt to invoke 90s nostalgia, while being targeted at little kids born after 2010. I couldn't stand 5 minutes of it.Kids who like shiny colors may like it."
134,Trolls,5,27 February 2017,My kids seemed to like this OK,"My kids seemed to like this OK. It wasn't too scary for my sensitive 8yo girl and yet I should have known better when my 6yo boy said he figured it out and ""didn't want to ruin it for us."" The intro to the situation and characters was interesting enough, but about half way through I wanted it to end. You may enjoy it more than me if you like pop music videos and lots of trippy animation. I was hoping for some laughs, but left with only a couple chuckles. I gave this a 5/10 and would skip it on family movie night at home. You'd probably be better off just buying the soundtrack if people still do that kind of thing?"
135,Trolls,4,26 February 2017,Good enough,"In a way, Trolls is a musical. There was too much singing, that eventually got tiring. But other than that, it was a cute movie. The one thing (other than singing) that put me off at first, was the troll eating (I mean, wasn't this supposed to be a children movie? if I was a kid, I would have been a little scared by that). But the story unfolds quite smoothly after that, and so the whole eating thing was nicely explained. Another negative was the many (many!) weird creatures. There were the trolls and their enemies, some talking clouds, not to mention all these creatures that wanted to eat the lead character. Other than that, the story was cute and the animation was very colourful and had a happy feeling and positive message. So, my rating is 4 out of 10 for Trolls."
136,Trolls,1,19 February 2017,"Humorless, Creepy, And Boring For All Ages","Given the cuteness of the wacky-looking and iconic little 1960s Troll dolls, there were infinite possibilities for a lively and fun-filled movie adaptation¬óalong the lines of Toy Story.Instead, children and their parent are given a mawkish and edgy fractured fairy tale. The creators try to prop up this train wreck with a lot of psychedelic razzle-dazzle computer graphics, dancing, and gratuitous pop music adaptations ¬ñ From Simon and Garfunkel to Percy Faith. Nevertheless, though the CG is rich in lively colors and choreographed scenes, the dreadful story is humorless shades of gray.The film starts out with very creepy characters called the Bergens whose only joy in life is to eat Trolls on ¬ñ believe it or not ¬ñ ""Trollstice."" Really? Maybe the title should have been something stolen from the Twilight Zone, i.e. ""To Serve Trolls."" This is not a terribly engaging or buoyant start, and too dark for younger audiences. It goes downhill from there when we learn that a lead character's grandmother was eaten by a Bergen long ago. And so he's a pouting Grinch through most of the movie. An insufferable 90 minutes of screen time is wasted on learning how the Trolls avoid being the next dinner entr√©e. This long-winded tale of forgiveness and redemption is lost on children and a dragged-out bore for adults. Unlike such contemporary animation classics as Shrek, there is only squandered energy in this film. There is nothing terribly humorous, no cadence of seat-of-pants action scenes, no slapstick comedy relief. The only running gag is a sparkle Troll that sprays enemies with glitter, like is some secret James Bond weapon. And, a hippy-dippy cloud that makes a slightly amusing cameo. This film is so anemic, it is light-years from anything ever created by the Disney geniuses - a dismal failure of imagination, simple playfulness, and comic relief."

138,Trolls,5,8 February 2017,Very mildly amusing.,"'TROLLS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A computer-animated kids' flick, based on the popular dolls (of the same name). It's a musical-comedy-adventure, about two trolls who attempt to rescue their friends from giant creatures, known as the Bergen, that eat trolls in order to be happy. The film stars the voice talents of Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Zooey Deschanel, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Christine Baranski, Russell Brand, James Corden and Jeffrey Tambor. It was directed by Mike Mitchell (who also directed the 2010 computer-animated hit 'SHREK FOREVER AFTER') and Walt Dohrn. and it was scripted by Erica Rivinoja, Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (based on the dolls by Thomas Dam). The movie was a hit at the Box Office, and it's received mostly positive reviews from critics. I thought it was OK. Trolls are creatures who are always happy, and they're constantly singing, dancing and hugging. The Bergen are much larger creatures, that are never happy; and the only way they can ever be happy (briefly), or so they believe, is to eat trolls. The trolls had been imprisoned by the Bergen, but they escaped. Now they've been located again, and several are captured. Two trolls set out to save their captured friends. The movie is colorful, and always visually pleasant to look at. It's also filled with catchy, and very upbeat, music, and it will probably make most children laugh. There's not a lot in it to entertain adults though, but it is a pretty well made kids' film. I found it to be very mildly amusing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc"
139,Trolls,4,8 February 2017,The Vidiot Reviews...,"TrollsTroll Dolls were only fun to play with as a toy when you had a bag of firecrackers. And while none of the imps in this animated-musical explode, they do sparkle.When the troll princess (Anna Kendrick) celebrates her tiny touchy feely tribes (Russell Brand, James Corden, Gwen Stefani) liberation from the unemotional Bergens 20 years ago, their singing and dancing attracts their former captors.Now, her eternally optimistic highness must work alongside naysayer troll Branch (Justin Timberlake) in order to save her subjects from becoming dinner.Glamming up an ugly chambermaid (Zooey Deschanel), the trolls set out to seduce the Bergen king (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).Butchering an array of classic songs that kids will no doubt accredit to this saccharine adaptation of the wild haired figurines, Trolls' boilerplate storyline and Smurf-like characterization is the opposite of its somewhat inventive animation.Incidentally, trolls actually live under bridges and eat suicide jumpers.

140,Trolls,6,15 January 2017,"Fabulous film for kids, might be the summer movie of 2017","I've seen them all from Shrek, Finding Dory, Ice Age, Madagascar, Toy Story, there's no animated movie I haven't seen. I think Wall E is my all time favourite as the story is very well produced and has many adult themes, but can very easily be understood and liked by kids who may not see all the nuances in the story, but would enjoy it anyway. Ice age is my next favourite for similar reasons and I think like old time fairy tales it can teach kids a lot about family, friends, staying positive, reaching goals etc etc. I love all of them for the same and sometimes different reasons but sadly Trolls will never be in the favourite list. It's a fabulous movie, the colours and textures, the designs and the warm fluffy feel, the farting (and ejaculating!) glitter and poo-ing cupcakes are all (mostly) right on the level of young kids up to maybe 10 years old. The singing and hugging and trendy chat are all going to be spot on for that age group and the story of course is traditional: beautiful people hurt by nasty villains fight back and win. However I would be extremely surprised if many adults liked this on an adult level. It's cutesy and lovable and if I had little ones I'd definitely take them and enjoy the film, but I would never watch it on my own (except for reviewing it) and I'd never watch it again as I have done with most of the others. I think most kids will be entranced, will maybe learn a song or too, and for smaller ones I can imagine the DVD being played over and over again. I gave it a 6 out of 10 partly because of the sexual references that I just think have no place in a kids movie, otherwise it would have easily got an 8."
141,Trolls,4,1 January 2017,My review of the movie Trolls.,"The story is so disjointed, especially in the beginning. Also, why is the black troll only happy once he turns another color? Hidden racism. I mean they break out in song that doesn't have anything to do with the story. Some of the songs don't even relate to the story. The story is way too predictable. Even my 5 year old granddaughter knew what was going to happen. It just was the feel good movie it poorly tried to be. The story also wasn't developed very well. I mean it just jumped right in there not giving the viewer any reason to like the. I just found them to be annoying. Take a tip from Pixar. Be original. Don't just pick a book or story and throw something together and expect audiences to like it. That's how that movie feels."
142,Trolls,5,27 December 2016,Nothing is original in this movie,"The people who made this movie simply took a top ten list of movie clich√©s, a recognizable brand, a 90' CD collection, references and scenes from other movies and mix them together into a 92 minute movie. All of the scenes where taken from other movies making this movie very predictable to the point that I thought that I had already seen it. The music is from the 90' but remixed, it's bearable.The visuals are appealing and very colorful and makes a very good distinctions between different parts and tones of the story.The movie is not bad but far from Pixar film, and the message is good but it seems that the creator didn't made anything other than the story but even that seems to be taken from another movie."
143,Trolls,6,24 December 2016,Trolls (2016),"rolls I don't know how popular troll dolls are among youth today but they were definitely a staple back when I was young. It was kind of odd getting a film based on the franchise in 2016 but you won't see me complain about an Anna Kendrick project...ever. Marketing for the film was positive with the Justin Timberlake song ""Can't Stop the Feeling"" being everywhere before its release. How did the film stack up to its animated counterparts of 2016 though? It has to be said that I generally don't care for animated films. The bulk of them are targeted and marketed towards little children (which is fine) which is why they don't always resonate with me. An animated feature must be wholly impressive and have innovative, compelling storytelling for it to connect with me. Side note, but I think Kubo and the Two Strings was a film that accomplished this and although it bordered on having adult themes it was rather fantastic. Now let's get back on track. Trolls doesn't really tread new ground. I'm no expert on animation or voice acting but I think the film was satisfying in these aspects. The film did a good job setting up the history between the trolls and Bergens , they brought a backstory into something I'm sure most of us are unfamiliar with. Some of the music and covers in the film are pretty impressive.I love hearing Anna Kendrick's singing voice. She's multifaceted in talents and her Princess Poppy is a cheery, boisterous, bundle of little joy. I enjoyed her troll rendition of ""The Sound of Silence"". There is good chemistry between Kendrick and Timberlake even though you never see them and they probably recorded the voices for their characters separately.I appreciate the film tries to keep itself simple at its core rather than try for overt messages and become a mess in the third act (ahem, Zootopia).While the film has fun moments I think there is a slight overabundance of characters and not enough purpose for many of them. The film doesn't ever really reach to spectacular levels and stays safe. Can't argue with that as its a kids film. The film has more than enough song and dance, quirk, and vibrancy going around to make children love it. It provides enough of the sweet and happy to keep the young ones entertained. However, if you are like me and looking for something special to write home about, this is not the picture for it.6/10"
144,Trolls,6,23 December 2016,"Excellent for Kids , not so for Adults, Still a nice Family watch","As expected from the cast Trolls has nice catchy soundtrack. The story is highly clich√©d with some comedy as expected.For kids this movie is just like Frozen filled with cute and likable characters and many sing along songs especially Can't stop the feeling. The overall film has a nice comical script with the same themes here with singing , hugging and dancing , living happily always. Then comes the ugly evil villain who will also change by sing , hug and dance.So for kids it's a movie to love and like. For the adults though it's like every other thing you have ever seen in an animated movie and this time with terrific too bright colors. Although Poppy's voice done by Anna Kendrick will always lighten up your mood. Straight forward this is a movie only intended for kids and families. I cannot recommend it to my friends or adults but sure I can recommend this to any kids and they will be most happy. The only thing I liked about this movie is that it always stand as simple and doesn't want to break any new ground by which I mean it's simply 1 and 1/2 hour enjoyment with any thought provoking or thinking how was it done , how it happened.Animations as expected are top notch and beautiful even though colors are overwhelming.And that's also the thing I don't like about this movie that without attempting to break any new grounds it's nearly fails in company of animated giants of the likes of Zootopia , Moana , Kubo and two strings.I don't think it will even receive Best Animated Feature nom at Oscar 2017 but it definitely has franchise potential.(Just like Minions)........"
145,Trolls,7,12 November 2016,Scrap It,"I need to preface this review by saying upfront, this movie is pretty meh. It's certainly not as terrible as I'm about to make it; but much like driving past the front yard of that permanently chipper neighbor whose thinks their farts small like a bowl of cherries (you know the type), to be honest I really, really, REALLY wanted to punch this movie in the face.The Trolls are a displaced race of tiny, happy-go-lucky critters who spend most of their waking hours singing, dancing, hugging and scrap-booking. Their mortal enemy, the ogre-like Bergens live lives of permanent unhappiness - letting loose only once a year for Trollstace. The main dish for the town-over is (of course) Troll. At one point the Trolls lived at the mercy of the Bergens, within the hollow trunk of the Troll Tree in Bergentown. But thanks to a gutsy escape plan forged by King Peppy (Tambor), their current civilization hides in the forest where they can sing pop songs to their hearts content.The events recounted above all take place before the start of the film, which are infectiously told by our main protagonist, the excessively cheerful Princess Poppy (Kendrick). Now twenty years later, the only thing the Trolls civilization have to worry about is the resident out-layer, Branch (Timberlake). Unlike the rest of the complacent Trolls, Branch remains fretful of the possibility of the Bergens coming back and as a result doesn't sing, dance or light up fireworks displays that wakes up the entire friggin' forest. Instead he quietly assembles resources for his underground bunker all while being chided by Poppy's friends. Needless to say, Branch was right, Trolls are taken, Poppy and Branch work together, in a story so cut and paste it'd arguably look better in a scrap-book.The problem with Trolls is despite it's candy-coated exterior and infectious musical moments, there's simply too little of everything going on. The journey back to Bergentown is wrought with danger, just not enough of it to actually matter. Poppy's obsessive chirpiness is comically out of step with the world around her, but not enough for it to be an actual struggle. Branch droll grouchiness ricochets admirably between Poppy's positive can-do, but not enough where it becomes a real sticking point. The narrative then shoehorns a Cinderella subplot that appears like it's going in an interesting direction, but of course, there's not enough of it. You see where I'm going with this?Thus when the most obvious theme of the tale is summed up succinctly by Kendrick and Timberlake singing ""Can't Stop the Feeling!"" the entire enterprise feels like a sugar rush filled with so many empty calories. No important life lessons are learned or internalized by the audience, no plot reveals coax a fundamental change in our characters and not much is actually accomplished by the end. Arguably the only life that has been changed for the better is that of Bergen scullery maid Bridget (Deschanel) but her arc flies in the face of the film's botched moral, i.e. the idea that happiness is always inside you and all you need is someone to bring it out (and maybe a good tune to groove to too).Never mind that happiness, like all emotions is fleeting. Pixar plumbed from this particular well last year with Inside Out (2015), creating a subtle, refreshingly layered take on the emotional spectrum. Trolls version of happiness on the other hand, is at best creaky and dogmatic and at worst, a cheap self-delusion of glitter farting banality. Over-played jukebox song covers, madcap bouncy castle physics and cotton candy tresses that can be whipped back and forth; it's all part of the act.What saves this film from truly being the worst is its soundtrack which for all it's auto-tuned glee can't help but worm into your ear and say there. The songs are folded in remarkably well into the story and rarely did it seem like the audience was waiting for the song to end for the plot to move forward. Some of the song choices (largely hits stolen from a wedding reception playlist) were blunt but since the prime demographic for this film are 5 and 6-year-olds, I can't exactly mark it down for that. I'm sure you'll have your personal favorite but mine was Zooey Deschanel's rendition of Bonnie Tyler's ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" which slyly tucked-in a few references to the music video.Other than that however, Trolls is an easily disposable movie, with cut and paste characters and remarkably little to say. It seems to be in a rush to sell you something but given its frantic forced glee, I'd argue the only thing it'll successfully vend are more Troll dolls. A minor miracle considering, when you really think about it, its very existence undermines its point."
