0,Waltz with Bashir,10,12 January 2009,An extraordinary achievement that redefines the documentary genre,"Let's get one thing straight from the beginning: Waltz With Bashir is an animated documentary. It may sound like a paradox, but hey, when the film played at the Cannes Film Festival (which it left with rave reviews but zero awards) it was inevitably compared to Persepolis, which is an animated autobiography. The comparison was also caused by both movies having open anti-war messages, but they couldn't be more different in concept and execution. They do have one important thing in common, though: they are animated not because it looked good, but because it was the best artistic choice the directors could make.In the case of Ari Folman, the choice was dictated by the unique angle from which he chose to tell the story: subjectivity. Folman, like many young Israeli men in the '80s, joined the army to fight in Lebanon when he was merely 18 (this was in 1982), thinking he could serve his country in the best way possible. Once the war was over, Folman's new career began, and he is now a successful actor, director and writer (among other things, he worked on the TV show that inspired HBO's In Treatment). However, he still wasn't able to completely get over the war experience, and so he decided to make Waltz With Bashir in order to exorcise his demons, so to speak. In doing so, he delivered one of the strongest, boldest documents about the true nature of conflict.Folman's introspective journey begins with the lack of memory: apparently, he and many of his fellow soldiers have trouble remembering the exact details of what happened in Lebanon. All they have left is dreams, like the haunting nightmare that opens the movie (26 murderous dogs surrounding the apartment of a former soldier, who believes it to be a subconscious punishment for his killing 26 dogs during a mission) or Folman's eerie flashback of himself and his friends emerging from the water after a massacre he can't (or perhaps doesn't want to) remember. Engaging in a pursuit of the truth, the director locates several people with first-hand recollections of those events, and all these people (minus two) supply their own voices for their animated counterparts.The stream of personal anecdotes and, as said earlier, dreams, made it impossible for Folman to show real footage of what he was trying to say. After all, how do you show a live-action dream sequence in a documentary without making it look corny? Hence the winning choice of rendering the whole story through animation, with just one exception (the final scene, the one that justifies the film's existence, consists of real filmed material). This gives the picture a feel that is both evocative and down-to-earth, a bizarre but powerful combination that has earned Waltz With Bashir comparisons with the similarly merciless Apocalypse Now. Like few other films about war (Folman has openly stated he despises Hollywood's treatment of the Vietnam conflict, not counting Coppola's masterpiece), this strange, captivating opus depicts it without making it look cool: it's ugly, it's reprehensible, it's the stuff nightmares are made of - not for nothing does it still haunt Folman and his friends.Journey of self-discovery, cinema as psychoanalysis, a document about the past, a warning for the future: Waltz With Bashir is all those things and much, much more. It's a unique piece of cinema, unmatched in its seamless mixture of raw power and peculiar visual beauty."
1,Waltz with Bashir,,7 December 2008,Political animation of a very high order,"Animation is not just for children - the French ""Persepolis"" (about a girl in Iran) made that clear and the Israeli ""Waltz With Bashir"" (about the invasion of Lebanon) dramatically underlines the point. The Israeli work was written , produced and directed by Ari Folman and is based on his experiences as a soldier and his video of his exploration of the traumatic events some 20 years later. Like any really powerful film, the opening and closing sequences are stunning - but the intervening one and half hours contain so many moving and disturbing images - some simply surreal - that the animation plays in the mind long after the credits have rolled.The title is a reference to Bashir Gemayel, the newly appointed President of Lebanon, who was assassinated on 14 September 1982 following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon on 6 June 1982. The assassination led the Israeli command to authorise the entrance of a force of approximately 150 Phalangist fighters into the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, resulting in a massacre of at least 800 civilians. It is this horrific incident that is the emotional heart of the movie and the cause of Folman's mental repression."
2,Waltz with Bashir,10,27 July 2008,A great blend of the real and the unreal.,"Waltz With Bashir is amongst the finest animation films I've seen. It is a very disturbing comment on war and its consequences both on countries and on people of both sides. No doubt this approach has been taken by numerous other film makers; however what sets Waltz With Bashir apart is that it takes a documentary approach and compares Israel's activities in Lebanon with atrocities in the past wars.Other than documenting events, the film also consists of surreal dream sequences and real life incidents. Thus the film emerges as a unique combination of the real and the unreal. The hand drawn animation also makes it a delight to watch. The colour gave it the right atmosphere of claustrophobia in open spaces and the background score is fabulous.It is certainly not, as the Director of NZ Film Festival announced before the screening, a 'feel-good film'. It should appeal to people who have an interest in animation, documentaries, war and current affairs. 10 out of 10."
3,Waltz with Bashir,10,8 September 2008,"An animated Apocalypse Now; in other words, confronting and powerful","Israeli director Ari Folman's Waltz with Bashir is easily the standout film of 2008, with its surreal animation style and abrupt way of portraying such a horrific event. The event being the Sabra and Shatila massacre, in which Palestinian men, women and children were massacred by Christian Phalangists as revenge for the assassination of their leader Bashir Gemayel. The Israelis did not perpetrate the killings but did nothing to stop them, even sending flares into the night sky to assist the Phalangists.The story follows Ari Folman, who meets a friend in a bar who tells him of the nightmares connected to his experiences from the 1982 Lebanon War. Folman is surprised to find out that he does not remember a thing from the same period. Later that night he has a vision from the night of the Sabra and Shatila massacre and does not know if it was real or not. In his memory he and his soldier friends are bathing at night at the seaside of Beirut to the light of flares descending over the city. Folman rushes off to meet another friend from his army service, who advises him to discuss it with other people who were in Beirut at the same time. The film follows Folman in his conversations with a psychologist and reporter Ron Ben-Yishai who was in Beirut at the same time.There are a few people who need to be congratulated here for their fine efforts in bringing this amazing film to life. David Polonsky, Art Director and Illustrator, along with Director of Animation Yoni Goodman have used a unique style of animation to tell a documentary/war film which shows the futility of war boldly. Although animated, the film features graphic violence and some of the most disturbing images I have ever seen. In particular, a scene showing horses dying in the streets is unflinchingly tragic and another scene showing families being shot is beyond depressing. This movie would probably not have had the same impact if it were not animated.The music, which features rock, Bach, Chopin, Schubert and an original score by Max Richter adds an incredible amount of depth and emotional impact to the already challenging imagery. The scene from which the title is named after, in which one of Folman's fellow comrades waltzes in the middle of gunfight, firing a heavy machine gun while surrounded by posters of Bashir, is magical as well as mystical.Waltz with Bashir is truly a must-see film; however, it is so confronting and sad. This is necessary, though, to show the pointlessness of war and the effect it has on people. This is evident in the last seconds of the film, when real footage of the aftermath of the massacre presents dark and graphic views of corpses. You will not leave the cinema happy, but you will leave feeling the power of a piece of art you will not forget anytime soon.5/5"
4,Waltz with Bashir,9,12 January 2009,"Great, personal film about the horrors of war","I saw this film at the AFI Film Festival a couple of months ago and it stayed with me since then. This is not your typical war movie, nor is it your typical animated film. I'd say its kind of a cross between Waking Life and Grave of the Fireflies.The film takes place in the present. The film's director, Ari Folman, comes to the realization that he cannot remember anything from the time he served in the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War. The bulk of the movie are his interviews with his old army friends where he asks them what they remember from that time. Folman tries to see in their memories something in himself that has been missing, deadened, or dulled. Like Waking Life, there is no ""plot."" The filmmaker prefers a more interview-based film. This is an ""idea film,"" a poetic film, and traditional narrative style takes a back seat.Like Grave of the Fireflies, the animation in Waltz With Bashir shows the horror of war and its effect on individuals in ways that a live action recreation could never replicate. The film's themes of human memory and its elasticity are served well by this technique. Rather than a soldier escaping death by hiding in the sea, we get the larger-than-life memory of a soldier escaping death that would look too ""real"" in a live action reenactment."
5,Waltz with Bashir,9,21 September 2008,a daring but natural choice,"Ari Folman first movie was a great promise, but more than a decade passed since then and with only one feature film, and several TV series on the record his career seems to be stagnating at best. Here he comes now with a film that is so sharp, surprising and different - one of the best Israeli films ever in any genre.Choosing to do an animated feature about the beginning of the first Lebanon war in 1982 and the collective trauma and amnesia caused by this war to its heroes - young soldier torn down from their first world life to be thrown in the violent absurdity of war - and the whole Israeli society is both a daring and natural thing to do. Daring because this film is after all a documentary about the search to the lost memory of the director about his own presence in war, and the journey to recover it by means of interviews with his fellows in arms. The real life persons are recorded while giving the interviews while extremely accurate drawn images play the visual role (one of the persons interviewed is a famous journalist showing up often on TV). As realist as these scenes are, it is hard to imagine how difficult it would have been to bring on screen the fighting scenes, or to play the trauma of the young boys shown into a terrifying and nightmarish reality. So animation was the right and natural choice. Without using special or expensive effects, the dreams and nightmare scenes are both catching and terrifying, reflecting the traumatized souls of the dreamers (one won't forget easily the opening scene).Yet, the message of the film is far beyond the personal message. When dreams (or better said nightmares) dissipate the deep-buried reality gets back - the massacres in the Palestinian camps become real on screen, and this is the only place where Folman uses fragments of filmed material rather than animation. The nightmare became reality and its a grim one. Without ever leaving the personal and emotional plans, the political statement about a war with no winners is made loud and clear without the need of being explicit."
6,Waltz with Bashir,10,12 June 2008,Very good movie,"I just came back from watching the movie. I found it interesting and unique. The animation in the film is magnificent and enables the director to really ""go wild"" with his ideas, without having to be ""chained"" to what reality filming can give him. The main Character, is on a journey, trying to collect as many memories as he can of the time when he was a young soldier, at war. This journey is so well done, touching, interesting. The man, Ari, slowly revels his past, and we follow him, to an amazing trip down memory lane. Memories that were hidden for too long. An amazing movie that makes you think about life, people, and the complexity of war."
7,Waltz with Bashir,9,4 October 2008,A kick in the guts for the price of a movie ticket,"If you're expecting the standard action anime think again. Starting with the pack of snarling rampaging dogs that opens the action, this is one of the most powerful films I've seen, quite shocking, and the technical switch to real news footage at the end brought me as close as I've ever been to throwing up in a movie theatre. You'll see what I mean. The surrealistic power of animation is fully exploited in the dream sequences and flashbacks of this story which at one level is a psychological exploration of traumatic memory. But the film goes far beyond the personal and delves into a particularly nasty few days of the Israeli occupation of Beirut in 1982 involving an unholy collusion with, as I said, gut-wrenching results for humanity.Will this win further enemies for Israel as one of the reviewers said? I hope not, and the courage of the film's official Israeli backers is appreciated. What the film shows is that we all, Nazi and Jew, Muslim and Christian, smart and stupid, are capable of some pretty inhuman behaviour if we allow ourselves."
8,Waltz with Bashir,9,1 January 2009,Hard-Hitting Film,"This film exists on several levels. It is partly a film about combat trauma, memory and repression, partly about the specifics of Israel's role in the Lebanese civil war, and partly about war in general as experienced by soldiers. It was cleverly constructed, moving back and forth from the middle-aged protagonist and his search for his lost memories via contacting old comrades, and the depiction of the actual events during the time of his and their youth. The film is mostly done in animation and uses animation in a very effective way.I do not believe it is at all relevant what someone's political opinions are in terms of appreciating this film. The film reveals truth through taking the viewer on a journey to the past through the memories of people who witnessed the worst days of the conflict."
9,Waltz with Bashir,9,9 June 2008,Powerful,"Waltz with Bashir may not deliver everything you expect after seeing the trailers, but it is powerful. Director Ari Folman presents a personal view of historic events in which he took part as a young soldier, but which he cannot remember due to repression. A full-length documentary, filmed with animation over the recorded speech of actual participants in the 1982 Lebannon War, Waltz with Bashir is beautifully done and get its message across clearly.It's a shame that some of the stronger artistic points in the movie were left undeveloped, such as the imaginary ghost of the soldier's ex-girlfriend following him around (as seen in the trailer). The way comedy and tragedy are interspersed in the latter parts of the film may also seem inappropriate to some viewers. The film presents a highly personal point of view for a documentary, justified partly by staying true to the factual material, and partly by its author having been there on the scene.Overall, despite its shortcomings, this film makes a strong statement and is definitely worth seeing for its visuals and score."
10,Waltz with Bashir,10,18 June 2008,Irritating?  What are you on?,"I think working on this movie for 4 years is long enough. You obviously missed the whole point. The point of the movie is not to point the blame at anyone, it is about showing the reality of war and what the affect it has on Soldiers.It's not about who won, who was right, or who did what wrong. Its about how people react to it and how it affects the people who are involved in it. Yes it showed only the Israeli side of things, but hey, its because it's on the Soldiers point of view, how they saw it, not how everyone saw it, not how the other soldiers. It shows his point view, and the interviewers points of views. Thats why its like this.And that is why it makes it so real. It is very well done."
11,Waltz with Bashir,10,26 January 2009,Perhaps the best film of 08.,"Waltz with bashir is something that is hard to forget, while the images grab you first it is the wonderful story and direction here that keeps things at a high level.While the flashback scenes are much better then the real time stuff, there is really no flaw to this film for 90 minutes and that is really saying something in today's film world where perfection is low.I wouldn't say this movie is the best of the year by far, but it could be argued and the movie has some of the most wonderful scenes I have seen in any film including a waltz with gunfire that is oh so memorable.Or the iconic image of men in the ocean looking to the sky, the soundtrack is wonderful with music from Bach and you really feel like there was good writers, directors and producers on this whole thing that made it moving, original and something to really spend some time watching."
12,Waltz with Bashir,8,26 November 2008,"Compelling, thought-provoking viewing.","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185616/ Released in the UK now. Limited US release on the 25th of Dec.It's rare that I usually leave the cinema speechless, before engaging in hours (literally) of discussion with those around me, but 'Waltz With Bashir' is no ordinary film for no ordinary audience. Emotionally enthralling, yet uneasily shocking, 'Bashir' follows director Ari Goldman as he visits various friends and foes trying to rekindle the memories he has forgotten of the Israeli-Lebanon War in 1982. Shot in memorizing animated visuals, it is a thought-provoking ride through the rediscovery of one man's forgotten nightmares.From the opening surrealist shot of twenty-six dogs rabidly racing down the Tel Aviv streets towards the 'dreamers' (Ari's friend) home, to the ending where the animation is sacrificed for a few short minutes to show the real, unaltered horrors of the Sabra and Shatila massacre from news reels and archive footage. Surrealism is constantly mixed with the truth, making you wonder, what did Ari really want to find out and to what end? Is this all he and those remembered, or what there memories would allow them to keep encapsulated.A frighteningly stark look at a young soldiers life, and how war can effect everybody involved, not just those remembered as a statistic on a board of casualties. As we delve further into his regained memories, we are made to wonder, is this journey exercising his demons, or simply just reigniting them? With the stunning visuals keeping you emotionally at arms length, detracting you from the events, before quickly dragging you back in with a horrifically haunting ending.'Waltz With Bashir' is compelling, thought-provoking viewing."
13,Waltz with Bashir,10,13 November 2015,Proud Of My Country,"Yes, I'm a Jew (an atheist Jew) from Israel. When this movie was released in theaters, I was about 11 years old, and I didn't want to see this film (I can't remember why). Ever since, I've heard many news and reviews and stories about the success this film got worldwide, especially in Israel, and yet- I never watched it. This week I decided to give this film a try- I finally wanted to know the reason for it's success. I just finished watching it, and now I understand exactly what I missed- the best Israeli film ever. The animation is unique and excellent, the story is interesting and was told spectacularly, the dialog is absolutely great, fast and well- paced movie, the opening scene is just brilliant, a great history lesson about one of Israel's famous wars, there was a lot of comedy and humor (to my surprise) which was handled and presented fantastically, the drama is also intense and well handled, can be a little harsh at times but there aren't many harsh and hard-to-watch scenes. Overall, great film, definitely the best movie ever came out from Israel, and like I said before- fantastically-told story and a great history lesson if you're learning about Israel's war with Lebanon."
14,Waltz with Bashir,,23 January 2009,Haunting psychological exploration of a soldiers guilt,"Although I saw it last night I am still unsure of my reaction to ""Waltz with Bashir"". I'm still digesting the film, attempting to understand more about it, still wondering if I found it remarkable or disappointing, if I thought its moral sensibilities were sound or superficially apologetic. Perhaps the ultimate irony in the film is that its main themes are those of willful ignorance and of amnesia, or willing repression of memories by the Israeli soldiers on whom the film focuses, but, as pointed out by the great film critic Joumane Chahine (who loved the film) in Film Comment: ""It's not that Folman minimizes Israel's complicity in the events, the IDF's logistical involvement has long been a matter of record... The film's more individual perspective justifies circumventing the matter. But the film's discreet arrogance is that, in contrast, it confronts head-on the brutality of the Lebanese Christian Phalanges who perpetrated the butchery. And while the Arabs' treatment of their Palestinian 'brethren' has hardly been exemplary, there is something particularly distasteful- somehow akin to watching a German film about Vichy France's treatment of Jews during World War II- about being lectured on this by the Israelis.""I did find this attitude highly ironic. The Israeli soldiers, the men he actually knew, are all, bar none (except for defence minister Ariel Sharon, who unquestionably was responsible at least in part for the proved massacre of anywhere between two to three and half thousand civilians of all ages and genders, and his presence also ties in with the theme of amnesia- after the massacre hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in protest of the IDF's involvement thanks to Sharon's decisions, but many years later they allowed him to become Prime Minister), sweet, good, morally perfect people. Yet the Christians are portrayed almost literally as dogs. Inhuman, brutal, violent, sick, and fetishistic with regard to their leader. The film makes a huge deal about the dead children and older men and women the soldiers saw in the camps, but Ari Folman doesn't even seem to think about the women, children, and seniors killed in air strikes and even ground initiatives by the IDF during the same war. Somehow, only what the Arab Christians did is truly horrifying. A little hypocrisy at play, or is it a matter of even more suppressed memories? All that said, I still found the film affecting, and its technical merits are unquestionably outstanding. The animation is gorgeous, the music even more special, and the film is a remarkable, rare exploration of how the guilt and pain these men feel to this day haunts them. It's not new subject matter, but the specifics of this film make it unique, that it focuses on the IDF's involvement in one of the most heinous massacres of the late twentieth century, and moreover that it focuses on involvement by young men who wouldn't have even been sure of what exactly was happening. The film's psychoanalytic approach (it is an 'animated documentary', but I suspect much of it was written, although I'm sure those interviewed were definitely quoted truthfully at many points, but what they say is a little too conveniently attached to the film's themes) is not always successful, and sometimes painfully obvious and tired (""You weren't thinking of these camps, but those camps"" or ""Unwillingly, you had stepped into the shoes of a Nazi""). Still, the imagery and music, as well as the genuine sincerity and honesty of the film (as well as its subjectivity) make it worthwhile viewing. It's extremely well-crafted and for the most part psychologically interesting, that much is for sure. It's also worth noting that the controversial ending worked for this viewer. Not cheap, not exploitative, but only a stark, brutal reminder of just how real it was."
15,Waltz with Bashir,,31 December 2008,A Masterpiece,"The only movie in the past few years that even comes close to it's power is 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days. But I would have to say even that film pales somewhat in comparison with Bashir. Because Waltz with Bashir is not only emotionally devastating, it also opens one up like a can of beans. It makes most other war films look silly and fake. On top of all that, it is the first film of it's kind. A graphic novel come to life, that is also a documentary. Astounding.The art work is wonderful. The calm tone of the film is soothing and also wrenching.You will cry. A lot."
16,Waltz with Bashir,10,1 February 2009,a waltz with death and memory,"Sometimes the only way to deal, or at least come to terms with, something inhuman and inescapable like experiences in combat can be through abstraction. When faced with the memories of such things, I can only personally imagine as someone who's never been shot at repeatedly or shot repeatedly at others as a soldier, memory remains, but sometimes not always intact or with things blocked. Waltz with Bashir is the best war film I've seen in however long I can recall to face up to the fact that people in war have to live with themselves decades after any conflict ends- such as Israel and Lebanon in Beirut in the early 80s- and that a person's own demons are tantamount to the devastation they might see or possibly connect to with the ""other"".In this case Israel and Palestine, once again a topic that will make some see the film even without really knowing what it's about. Many will be surprised; it's an original hybrid, maybe the most original to use rotoscoping since Waking Life and with the same power of those Gerald Scarfe animated war-scenes in Pink Floyd's the Wall, and at the same time a documentary. The director himself is the subject, at least in part, as Ari Folman goes around to people who he fought with or may have known or knew fought in the Lebanon war, and he tries to figure out what else he may have seen of a massacre which only a piece of a hallucination-cum-memory, where he rises out of a beach and puts on clothes with two other soldiers, remains elusive.What do the other ex-soldiers have to say or reminisce about? Usually about some painful or just some strange experiences that can only be told from the horses' collective mouths. A vision of a naked woman ascending onto a boat to comfort a nauseated soldier who later swims across a sea back to his fellow soldier; another who is in a trench against unseen snipers in tall buildings who forces his way to use another gun so that he can do a ""waltz"" of the title while firing; another soldier describes seeing a field of destruction and bodies as if in ""an LSD trip"". And all the while Folman drifts in and out trying to piece things together, sometimes telling of before and after the war (trying to get a girl he lost back with no luck) or just seeing apocalyptic visions like bombed planes at an airport with no one in sight. Every story mounts to something more and more devastating, and as we learn more about Folman and his background- parents survived Auschwitz- we can start to realize his completely unconscious guilt about a massacre that occurred that technically the Israelis had no 'direct' involvement in (it was ultimately Christian soldiers who killed the masses of people in Beirut, but it was given the 'whatever' pass by the Israeli troops).But it would be just one thing if this were just a documentary charting memory of wartime, or another if one were to learn more about a conflict that isn't quite as well known to the casual observer of Israeli-Palestinian-Lebanon military conflicts (and there's no lack of them sad to say). Either of these could make splendid and harrowing pieces of non-fiction, but the animation elevates it so something else. Folman knows some of this is so painful and haunting and shocking, if only for himself if not also for the audience (and it is), that the only way to sift through it and come to grips with it is to see it played out, dramatically, in another medium. The animation is not always ""trippy"" like a Linklater picture, but some of it is truly astounding ""trippy"" animation, with visions and dreams and memories put together, with the occasional funny scene (i.e. ""fast-forward"" through the porno tape) that work far greater in animation than it would in live action.It provides a freedom of expression, possibilities, but it serves an emotional and even moral context. As animation that is *not* for the kiddies (i.e. Persepolis, Linklater's films) can show time and time again, when given the chance or slips through the kiddie-tested waters, another level of expression can hit an audience with colors and vibrancy and mixtures that come closer to how a mind sometimes sees things, if in this case tragically in retrospect. And yet, by the end of Folman's great film, there's a shot that zooms through the crying masses of Palestinian women to the face of Folmans, and then to some actual footage from 1982 at the camp following the devastation. Sometimes you need cold, hard facts, sometimes just a memory, and sometimes it's so unreal as to believe even happened. Waltz with Bashir deals with all of these things with a scope that is nothing less than moving and appropriately jarring. A+"
17,Waltz with Bashir,,1 October 2008,Nothing short of the best war movie that I've seen in a very long time,"Nothing short of the best war movie that I've seen in a very long time, Waltz touches a deep nerve of truth, not unlike The Deerhunter did, despite also non-contradictorily engaging the fluidity and uncertainty of memory and identity as both a means to that truth as well as some of its content. This is quite an accomplishment. Its vulnerable embracement of that epistemological difficulty is perhaps what's most admirable about the film. And its striking formal innovations are organic to that journey, drawing it out. Persepolis is quite a good film, but it cannot claim an equivalently rich multidimensionality.Surely a flashpoint, which likely hinders certain award winning, the film is compatible with an intersubjectivity of certain truths although it takes a definitive position on some of them. Purveyors of near-absolute cultural relativism or wobbly moral equivalency will accuse it of monologue, and hence internal contradiction. Others who hide behind false dichotomies and subordinate omissions to acts or individual obligation to collective responsibility will accuse it of self-flagellation. In any event, it's a film that compels dialogue. To me, it's an interrogator of brutal truths."
18,Waltz with Bashir,1,12 June 2011,"WALTZ WITH BASHIR got one thing right. When it comes to compulsive self criticism, Jews and Israel can't be beat.","WALTZ WITH BASHIR got one thing right. When it comes to compulsive self criticism, Jews and Israel can't be beat.If I had just dropped in from Mars with little knowledge of world history, and my first history lesson was WALTZ WITH BASHIR, I'd assume that Israel was an immoral miscreant for trying to defend itself against a particular ideology that delights in killing Jews. For example, on March 11, 1978, the PLO crossed from Lebanon into Israel, hijacked two buses, and murdered 37 people in cold blood, mostly kids. During the course of Arafat's adventures in Lebanon, the PLO murdered thousands of Christians, conducted terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and according to the U.N., violated 270 documented cease fire agreements. These little facts, including any reference to terrorists, Fatah, the PLO, or endemic Jew-hatred in the Middle East were conspicuously absent from the movie.Between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon suffered approximately 200,000 civilian fatalities in a series of running conflicts involving Muslims vs. Christians, Syrians vs. Christians, the PLO vs. both Jews and Christians and the U.S. Marines getting hammered in Beirut. The number of civilians killed by the IDF was a small fraction of this number. One major point that the movie failed to point out is that the government of Lebanon INVITED the Israelis into Lebanon to help them get rid of the PLO, which the IDF eventually succeeded in doing. Part of the deal was to allow Arafat and his thugs to escape to Tunisia where Arafat could spend his days dreaming of dead Jews and basking in the glow of his European and Arab sycophants. Then, in 1993, under the Oslo Accords, Jewish guilt plus temporary insanity caused Israel to invite Arafat and the PLO back to the West Bank. Big Mistake! Let's not forget that when Israel REALLY occupied the West Bank, and not just 1.7% as it does today, Israel built Palestinian Universities, roads, hospitals and the life expectancy of West Bank Palestinians went from 44 to 67 years of age! The movie gives the impression that Beirut was utterly destroyed by the IDF. In fact, Beirut was largely in ruins due to Christian Phalange attacks against Palestinian positions well before the IDF arrived. It is true that the IDF shelled and bombed buildings and allegedly killed several thousand civilians in an effort to destroy the PLO and related Palestinian terrorists. This really got Europe and the U.N. upset because they believe that Jews should not be allowed to defend themselves unless they can absolutely guarantee that there will be no collateral damage. Of course, the movie completely ignored the factors that compelled Israel to enter Lebanon in the first place. History reveals that Europe and the U.N. were complacent, not only when the PLO terrorized Israel, but both Europe and the U.N. failed to mount any meaningful protest after the PLO murdered, raped and tortured the Christian residents of Damur. Just as irritating is the fact that Europeans, who are in no position to criticize Jews, are probably unaware that Palestinian Muslims have been killing Palestinian Jews long before Israeli statehood in 1948. Does Haj Amin al-Husseini and the Muslim Brotherhood ring a bell? Probably not.The final scene in the movie shows the massacre of Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Chatila. These camps, in fact they are cities, became headquarters for the PLO. NOTE: WHY ARE THERE PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS IN THE FIRST PLACE? Some 800,000 Jews were driven out of Arab countries between 1948 and 1950, and most of them were successfully integrated into Israeli society. Why haven't Muslims accepted the Palestinians as equal citizens in any of their numerous nations? In any case, the IDF agreed to let the Christian militias go into the camps and drive out the PLO. The militias went crazy and took revenge on the Palestinians for murdering their families. During the siege of the camps, some members of the IDF suspected that Palestinian civilians were being killed, but they didn't do enough to stop it. In fact, the only recourse for the IDF would have been to go into the camps and start killing their Christian allies. In the end, after all the suffering caused by the PLO, the only thing that the world remembers is the Israeli connection to Sabra and Chatila.Also, the movie makes the IDF out to be the most inept, corrupt, perverted fighting force in existence. One wonders how the IDF managed to win all its wars while receiving absolutely no American military aid during two of its most difficult defensive wars - Israel's War of Independence and the 1967, Six Day War?"
19,Waltz with Bashir,10,12 December 2008,Astonishing - you must see this film,"It is clear from the opening moments of ""Waltz with Bashir"" that this is something quite extraordinary. A pack of dogs (rendered in the film's idiosyncratic animation) races through streets terrifying all around them but carrying on with unrelenting pace and cruel stares. They congregate outside a building and growl at a man inside. It is intense, beautiful and exciting to watch, and, in a moment which does not even focus on our main character, the audience is completely gripped.After such an opening, one could be forgiven for forgetting that what they are watching is a documentary. However, that, in a way, is what it is. The film is based around director Ari Folman's attempts to remember his experiences from the Israel-Lebanon war of the 1980s and his interviews with old friends and others as he sought to find his memories. This is about youth and war, but amnesia, individual, national and international, runs through this film and as such, the whole film seems to be like a dream. The fantastical and the strange are never far away and the power of the images which the film creates is telling.The central image of the film (our main character's first flashback) is a haunting and beautiful moment. Everything is cast in an orange haze as three young soldiers, who have been bathing naked in the sea, are disturbed by the appearance of flares falling to the earth. It is never clear as to whether this really happened or if it is merely an imagining. This is an idea which runs through the film. Is this all a dream? But, in that moment, there is also the apparent innocence of the youths and their naive nature: a nature which is torn to pieces by the films events. Also there is the strange and tragic beauty which pounds through the film. It is breathtaking.The sheer style and quality of the animation is the film's beating heart, and the extraordinary stories that it tells create more incredible images to be shown. This film is always mesmerising, always engrossing and utterly fresh and original. Folman's film is brief but insightful: compassionate with the young soldiers, but unrelenting about the horror of war and the atrocities which were committed. The film is honest, funny, interesting, engaging, moving and staggering.During the film, Folman shatters the veil of dreams and gives his audience the reality. Some have seen this as a misstep, but it drives home the terrifying truth behind this film and leaves one shocked by it. Anyone who counts themselves as a lover of film must see this. It is astonishing.5 Stars out of 5"
20,Waltz with Bashir,7,25 January 2009,Very Good.,"Being from Israel, I Didn't need any introduction to the occurrences in the movie, like why Israel invaded Lebanon, what's this conflict is all about, why the Christians Militia murdered the Palestinians and who was Bashir. But I'm not sure that this is the case with common viewer outside the region, and I think that this kind of information lacks in this movie.The artistic aspect of the movie is awesome. The animation is superb and it's aided with a decent score. I also loved the idea of the movie - which is the journey of the director to his own memory through stories of different others, connected to the events of 1982 in Lebanon.There are some very strong moments, but I lacked some point in the movie. I didn't clearly understand what the director wanted to show me. Is it the massacre? Is it the guilt of the soldiers for not preventing the murder? for leaving others behind? for killing innocent people? Or all of that, as a horrible consequences of war? I just felt that it's not strong as it ought to be because it's not concentrated on one specific topic, but trying to raise many different.My expectation were a little bit higher about this movie, because it's director's personal story. And it's involving his feelings. But overall, a very good, very solid movie."
21,Waltz with Bashir,8,2 October 2008,Recovered memories of the 1982 Lebanon war in animation arouse decidedly mixed feelings,"What Ari Folman's calls his ""animated documentary"" follows a film director who's having trouble remembering a massacre that occurred while he was serving in the Israeli army during the Lebanon War in the early '80s. He tries to fill in the gaps by tracking down his old comrades. Eventually he recreates the Sabra and Shatila massacres as seen from his and his comrades' point of view.The look and the content of this film are harsh and the emotional effect is ultimately powerful, though the subject most of the way though is the numbing down of Israeli veterans who have been involved directly or by proxy with the wholesale killing of Arab civilians. In combat revived memories show the soldiers like zombies, unaware of what they're doing, shooting in all directions without even choosing targets. In contrast to their numbness and indifference, the background music is as loud as an 80's disco; perhaps intentionally: the year of the war is 1982--the height of the disco era. Film music includes a chilling Israeli song that boastfully begins ""I bombed Sidon/Beirut today...."" For contrast, too often, a Bach keyboard concerto, the same one Glenn Gould used for the background of 'Slaughterhouse-Five' in 1972, is blasted forth.A lady psychiatrist the film director meets with tells him that soldiers' ""disassociating"" from combat horrors is a common psychological phenomenon. Ironically, the thing that makes one Israeli stop ""disassociating"" during the invasion of Beirut is entering the hippodrome and observing a massacre of Arabian horses. Mowing down humans didn't affect him.The director also spends time on several visits with a pot-smoking comrade based in Holland who's become rich selling falafel (an Arab food, one might point out) and lives on a posh estate near Amsterdam. He and the director get stoned together and remember. Various other 40-something Israeli army vets appear--animated talking heads whose memories, when they come back, are also in turn animated and shown. One describes abandoning the invasion on his own, going AWOL in effect, and by doing so inadvertently surviving when most of his unit was wiped out by the Lebanese, while he lay hidden for a long time in a zone where all were presumed dead, then swimming in the calm ocean until, exhausted, almost unable to walk, he comes up on the beach and inadvertently rejoins his own regiment. He has previously repressed most of this experience because of thinking himself a coward who had betrayed his comrades.The titular sequence concerns a particularly macho squad leader who in central Beirut under heavy firing, borrows back the automatic weapon he favors and goes into the street, dancing around, firing in all directions while snipers fire from above, yet surviving. At this time Bashir Gemayel, the new Lebanese President, had just been assassinated, which was taken as a signal for the Israelis to step up their attack. At this time they were allied with the Lebanese Christian Phalangist Militia. The Phalangists subsequently were allowed to go into the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps on the pretext that there were several thousand Palestianian ""terrorists"" still hiding there. They killed at least 800 Palestinian civilians, including women and children. The Israelis knew this, and did nothing. The film reports one soldier calling Ariel Sharon to tell him, and Sharon saying merely thanks for the information, happy new year.This is the climax of the film, the massacre, seen from a safe distance, but with analogies to Nazi murders and the Warsaw ghetto and with a few seconds of live actual video footage of loudly wailing Palestinian women after the massacre going back to witness what has happened and saying over and over to the camera in Arabic (not translated) ""Photograph this, bear witness!""This animated film will appeal to some for its originality and specificity to the experiences of a few Israeli soldiers. It is probably also notable for the accuracy of its representation of the tanks and weaponry and uniforms of the Israeli army of the period. What gives it a bad taste for me is its totally Israeli focus. The concern is not so much the massacre as the guilt feelings of the Israeli soldiers for having allowed it to happen, and, most of all, on their repression of any sense of guilt or even memory of the 1982 Lebanon war. It is they who have suffered, in their eyes; the dead horses matter more than dead Palestinians. (They would perhaps not see this.)One writer (Onion A.V. Club) with some reason links 'Waltz with Bashir', for its ""dreamy, meditative rhythms,"" to Linklater's Rotoscoped 'Waking Life'--and questions whether it would be of as much interest if it were live-action. In fact the value and point of the animation is that Folman can recreate the recovered memories of the soldiers--just as they remember them. He, that is the director, initially remembers absolutely nothing (But do actual film records exist? Surely they do). Perhaps the film is correct in not making any political point, perhaps not. It seems like raw material, the experiences it refers to still not fully digested and understood, the larger political context left undefined. This is of course a film that would be experienced very differently in various Israeli, Lebanese, or Palestinian settings, and might be wasted on some American audiences. Note the A.V. Club writer's question. But at least what we have here is a strong artifact, the only one in the New York Film Festival, of the torment that is Middle East politics. The film is in Hebrew with English subtitles. Subsequent to its October showing in the NYFF it will be released by Sony Pictures Classics starting December 26, 2008. will open in the US starting December 26, 2008."
22,Waltz with Bashir,10,21 January 2009,Waltz with Bashir (2008),"This is a graphic novel in film form. This is an animated film that doesn't know it's not live-action. Waltz with Bashir may very well be the most important film of 2008. Waltz with Bashir is a very personal memoir of the Lebanon War of 1982, with the accounts of writer/director/producer Ari Folman and various real life individuals who fought on Israel's side during their odyssey into the hellish nightmare that would await them in Lebanon. The film plays out documentary-style, featuring the likenesses and words of Ari Folman himself, and many others who have the most amazing stories to tell about their experiences in this war. The film begins as a friend of Ari Folman is describing a recurring nightmare he has had for the past 20 years that is connected to a traumatic experience he had in the Lebanon War. This telling jump-starts Ari's own memories, and prompts him to seek out others who he fought with in the war to try and put the pieces of a seemingly unsolvable puzzle together. The quest he undergoes will reveal startling truths, harrowing and gritty accounts by Israeli soldiers, and profound revelations.One story in particular involving a man whose fellow soldiers were wiped out on a beach in Lebanon, and the man subsequently had to swim far out to sea and stay there until it was clear to swim back, particularly moved me. Waltz with Bashir pulls no punches at any time; the war action is just as bloody and graphic as anything you will see in live-action war films, and the film intelligently explores the atrocities committed on both sides, by both Israeli troops and Lebanese Phalangists. The film's soundtrack has the most brilliant combination of Classical, Israeli Rock, and Euro Dance, and the animation style is designed to look like a graphic novel. The film has very profound messages, as Ari begins to question whether finding out the truth and solving the puzzle is something that he truly wants to do. Wouldn't it be better to forget about the horrors of war and pretend it never happened? Luckily for us, Ari does not follow that route, instead confronting his past head-on by creating this brilliant film about his journey to uncover the truth.The film culminates in Ari's profound revelation that he may have inadvertently contributed to a massacre committed by Christian Phalangists in Lebanon, and symbolizes this revelation with a single use of live-action at the film's climax. This use of live-action is absolutely devastating, and one of the most powerful scenes in film this year. This is an astounding film about war, traumatic memories, and regret that stands as one of the most important films about genocide since Hotel Rwanda and Schindler's List. If you have any means of seeing this film, do it now.10/10"
23,Waltz with Bashir,8,22 January 2009,Good morning Lebanon  Waltz with Bashir,"Waltz with Bashir is a wonderful feat by director Ari Folman, putting his memories and those of others in the 1982 Lebanon War on full display. The remorse of whatever role they might have or not have played in the Sabra and Shatila massacres is never glossed over. These men either have vivid recollections or strong repressed dreams of what happened in that defining moment of their lives.It all begins when our lead, Folman himself, meets an old friend at a bar who proceeds to tell him of a recurring nightmare, one that involves his being haunted by the 26 dogs he killed in the war. The rest of his group knew he wouldn't be able to kill a human being so they told him to take out the animals, and even those left an indelible mark on his psyche. Besides finding out Boaz's dream interpretation, the exchange really becomes the impetus of the film. Folman, never having any bad dream or memory of that period in his life, returns home and experiences a surrealistic vision of he and a friend, Carmi Can'an, bathing in the water as the flares light up the sky, the two of them slowly exiting, getting dressed, and walking out of the town. This becomes the one incident that Folman can grasp onto about his inclusion in the fight, yet when confronting his friend, finds out that it may never have happened. Carmi, (who at one point tells the filmmaker that he can draw him but not take video), seems to have not wanted to be involved in the movie as someone else voices his character. I haven't done research on this subject, but from the comment about videotaping, I imagine he declined and hasn't since passed away.The fact that Folman has this vision, though, must mean something, even if it never happened, so he decides to speak with his psychologist. This man tells him that while the event never occurred in reality, it doesn't mean that it never took place. To Folman, that night in the water becomes a way of telling himself that he was there, but not involved. It's deduced that perhaps his mind, conflicted with the fact that his parents were in Auschwitz and yet he participated in another genocide, only this time on the side of murderer, has covered his involvement with a manifested picture, hiding his guilt from coming to the surface. As Folman speaks with more people involved in the battle, though, that memory begins to come into focus and he finally remembers what happened that night. It's all shown on screen, along with the aftermath. And it is a powerful sequence watching these men partake in a massacre, never fully understanding what part they played until it was all over.Being something that depicts events that were not documented visually, the use of animation works perfectly. Events could be recreated and then made into drawings, adding in the special effects and scenery to make it look and feel like Lebanon in 1982. It is a process that saves money from needing to set explosions and dress up existing locales to stand in for Beirut, etc. Also, being that the pivotal moment from Folman's mind is a dream, we are able to see it just as vividly as any other scene of reality. Don't worry, though, just because it is animated does not make it any less graphic or true. All the blood is still there as well as the utter destruction the Israeli's left in their wake. A huge disregard for anything is depicted as tanks just run into buildings as they attempt to turn a street corner or guns are shot into areas not caring what the bullets may hit. One sequence follows the numerous attempts at taking out a vehicle driving down the road. The Israelis or Phalangists constantly miss it, but never stop, bombing everything and destroying whatever is nearby without a second thought.Some of the firsthand accounts are pretty amazing to hear. I especially enjoyed Ronny Dayang's account of an ambush and how he was left hiding behind a rock until nightfall when he swam to the opposite shore, only to find the regiment that abandoned him. It is actually quite fascinating hearing all these stories of remorse and guilt being that it is an Israeli film showing the Israeli side of the war. But it is the 19-20 year olds that are reminiscing, the boys told to not only kill, but to also probably die. I think the most obvious moment that shows how planned out the massacre was comes from reporter Ron Ben-Yishai, a man that walked the frontlines without fear as his cameraman crawled on the ground. He relates about how he called a high official about the rumors of the Palestinian genocide, and the response he got was, ""did you see anything?"" When the answer was not firsthand, he was told, ""thanks for bringing it to our attention."" I'd be very interested to hear what lie he would have spun if Ben-Yishai said yes. This was retaliation for the assassination of the president-elect Bashir, the Christian man set to lead Lebanon. His death sparked the destruction at the hands of the Phalangist Christians, using the Israelis as accomplices to get their blood. There was no stopping it."
24,Waltz with Bashir,8,17 November 2008,A great movie generates an interesting question,"I just watched the movie in 49th Thessaloniki International Film Festival. I liked it a lot in all aspects: overall story and idea, animation, direction, music etc. But after the film I have the following question. The film blames the Israeli activities during the Lebanon war. The poor efficiency of the Israeli army and of course the obvious support for the massacre are among the main parts of the story. Not even anti-Israel activities are presented or mentioned in any part of the film to provide a ""support"" for such activities. I find this of course very open-minded and great to come from an Israeli production but I am astonished that this received the official support of Israel based organizations like The New Israeli Foundation for Cinema & T.V. and the Israel Film Fund. And then all these awards from the Israeli Academy.Again I think this is great but are all these organizations really so open-minded and in peace with the not so long past or I am missing something?"
25,Waltz with Bashir,9,10 October 2015,Brilliant,"I believe this is the 3rd or 4th time I'm watching this film. Haven't watched it in a very long time.I'm not a big fan of our cinema here in Israel, but this film is just brilliant. Definitely on the top 10 and one of the best animations ever made. This is a combination of excellent direction, excellent score (and sound editing), excellent animation and great story telling (I'd say ""writing"", but I'm not sure how much was written and how much is from real interviews).The movie tells stories of the Lebanon war from the eyes of different Israeli soldiers. It's an anti-war movie and like many Israeli movies that succeed in Europe, it's very left-wing. Still, it's an amazing film, showing the chaos of war and the sad moments. It's mostly moving because you know and feel the stories are real."
26,Waltz with Bashir,9,16 September 2015,Powerful and Accessible,"An Israeli film director interviews fellow veterans of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon to reconstruct his own memories of his term of service in that conflict.indieWire named the film the tenth best of the year, based on the site's annual survey of 100 film critics. Xan Brooks of The Guardian called it ""an extraordinary, harrowing, provocative picture."" The film was praised for ""inventing a new cinematographic language"" at the Tokyo Filmex festival. Despite the positive critical reception, the film was only moderately commercially successful in Israel itself.I love the way this is animated. Similar to rotoscope, but less awkward looking. And it takes a very serious, dangerous, and deadly historical note and makes it palatable by having it be these people recount their memories and be animated, so it does not have that harsh reality."
27,Waltz with Bashir,9,27 January 2009,Words cannot describe...,"Only images.Please read all of the comments found here, because they are (for the most part) pretty much spot on. This film is to me one of the best of the year alongside the Wrestler, MR73, Chaser, JCVD, The Dark Knight, Benjamin Button, and Doubt, and I really can't add any other informative information alongside what has already been written. So this short comment will have to suffice.This fantastic documentary follows filmmaker Ari Folman and his mission to remember his role in the Lebanon war, particularly his role in the massacre of Sabra and Shantila in '82. However, this isn't any ordinary documentary; it is an animated one.With fantastic hand painted journeys that project both despair and beauty, backed up by fantastic music from Max Richter, this incredible story needs no words to be described; the film will describe itself.If you love cinema and want to see an unusual, creative, original, near-masterpiece courtesy from Israel, then please try and catch this. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, Waltz With Bashir is a marvelous achievement that deserves all the success it is receiving.9.6/10"
28,Waltz with Bashir,,20 April 2009,"""What terrible things Israel has done and how wonderful it is to have souls sensitive enough to admit it.""","Ari Folman, who did his military service as an infantry soldier in the 1982 Lebanon War,happens to meet a companion in arms who tells him about his war visions. Apparently this fellow could not a shoot a person so he was ordered to kill the dogs in Lebanese villages because when you enter a village they bark to alert and cause the fugitives to run. The dogs he killed in the war start coming back to him in his dreams and he thinks the dreams are coming from somewhere. After Folman listens to his friend he realizes that he does not remember much about the war.Later on, he has a vision about the Shatila massacre in which Lebanese Phalangists commit horrendous atrocities with the overlooking of Israeli soldiers. In his vision, they seem to be bathing at night in Beirut. Folman meets another fellow back from the army and says his friend's dream somehow triggered his memories but something is missing. His friend suggests that he should talk to as many friends as he could from those days. We see him talking to his old friends during most of the movie. The interviews are supported with the duly-noted flashbacks.It feels like you are watching a gritty real documentary tinctured with a novel-like style though you are just watching a classic animation,a conglomeration of pure,simple drawings. Even if you are not someone who can sit before a documentary for so long, this somehow gets to you because it's animation, it's cartoon, it's pure drawing, it's feature-length movie,it's not just one thing... I have seen other anti-war movies like 'Grave of the Fireflies' but I guess this gets to me better because it could be called 'recent' and its ramifications are still current.Think about it...somehow Israel still fights about something it calls 'terrorism' but unfortunately most of the people who lose their lives along the way are civilians-mostly little children and women. In that context, it is highly important that the movie draw a comparison between the attitude of the SS soldiers in holocaust and the behavior of Israel Defense Forces soldiers in Shatila massacre because this very example of 'Thanks for bringing it to my attention' attitude instead of the 'I'll look into it' sensitivity was what caused the death of many poor civilian Jews in the holocaust. Waltz With Bashir is a memorable movie with its emotionally powerful cinematography,its sensitive language, its animation style and with its potential contribution to peace."
29,Waltz with Bashir,3,29 November 2008,Not Great,"I watched it for a second time this eve and found it irritating for a second time. I guess the fact that women and children were killed and this div of a solider couldn't remember it just made me feel uncomfortable....AND this was not fiction. It stood as no testament to the families of those who were killed. Not being able to remember and making it as a cartoon, not offering the perspective of the victims merely serves to trivialize suffering. Going round to all of your mates and at no point appearing uncomfortable....or even shedding a tear....its just weird.my review...I saw this film at the Cinema in London where I live and I did not enjoy it. It just didn't work for me. I think the documentary style mixed with animation was incongruous and distracting and did not lend itself well to its subject matter. I also felt that it lacked characters, I felt that the people were all one dimensional and well cartoonish. The animation did not bring to life the people involved.Sure it was visually arresting but that was not enough - film is propelled by story too. I just did not sympathize with the protagonist and therefore didn't care about his journey into memory. I did not get any sense of who he was prior to the war and what provoked him to start remembering or indeed visiting his army colleagues.We did not see the protagonist change which is a tenet of film. Slowly remembering was a weak premise and was not enough to sustain me. The remembering appeared to have no effect on him whatsoever. It came across as a lot of facts that were disturbing facts, sure. I think it would have worked better if the memory sequences where animated and the interviews were filmed. The dullest thing I have ever seen on screen is a man being interviewed as a cartoon.It was over stylized. I also found the constant ""talking"" distracted from the visuals and being ""told"" the story whilst being ""shown"" the story was amateurish and unnecessary. There's an old maxim ""don't tell the story show the story""and surely that would be the purpose of using animation. The film would have worked with much less dialogue/voice over.I didn't feel I knew the main protagonist at all and had no real sense of his relationships with the other people. I asked myself why use animation to tell such a story? What does the animation add to this story? Nothing! As for the ending well. It hijacked itself as far as I am concerned because it reverted to film. Ultimately the horrors that it was trying to convey with animation where more starkly depicted with film rather than animation. And ultimately the horrors belong to the innocent not some dozy solider."
30,Waltz with Bashir,8,29 April 2010,Massacre,"Ari Folman's days in the Israeli army keeps haunting his memory. Had his mind played tricks on him, or what? He decides to see his comrades that were involved in the conflict in which Israel invaded Lebanon. Through conversations, the events that led to the massacre of Palestinian citizens become clearer, as he examines what really occurred in Lebanon in 1982.Using the anime style, Ari Folman reenacts the year in which he was in the front and what led to the terrible outcome of that 1982 invasion of Israel. Folman wants to reconstruct the events that ended with the killing of innocent people that did not need to die at the hands of the Lebanese Christian militia, while the Israelis looked in the opposite direction by letting the paramilitary group eliminate those poor souls caught in the conflict.The film ends with newsreel account of the real tragedy. Up to that point, Mr. Folman had presented his friends, some now scattered all over the world, who chose to leave their country, perhaps in order to forget. Living with what they had witnessed was more than anyone could endure. Ari Folman shows a courage in delving into a human tragedy that should not have happened.The film, written and directed by Ari Folman, is told in animated style. Mr. Folman and his collaborators created a film with characters that never seem like caricatures because the way they seem real. It is as though one would be watching real people presenting their recollections of those fatal events of not too long ago."
31,Waltz with Bashir,7,10 September 2009,"Revisiting the past, setting the record straight and coming to terms with the reality of the situation; in a waltz down an ominous memory lane.","When we recall our memories; we recall them in a non-linear and relatively random, disjointed manner  shooting from one time or location to the next, seeking out that sense of a humbling nature as we come to terms with what we did, or saw. Sometimes they are of a pleasant kind as we recall what good deeds we did on a certain day; or that of an unpleasant kind, when we live in regret and experience those short, sharp stabbing sensations when we, often accidentally, recall an occasion we'd much rather forget: something we said to someone; something we might've done when we were too young and didn't know any better, that we look back on now and realise how wrong we were. It was Robin Williams' character, in Mark Romanek's 2002 film One Hour Photo, who stated ""Photographs always represent a happy occasion; because nobody takes a photograph of something they don't want to remember."" In one sense, it'd be great if the human mind operated like this: picking and choosing the good times; but if this were the case, we would loose everything of what actually makes us who we are as individuals if all the bad could be detoured around.Isreali animated film Waltz with Bashir enjoys incorporating the notion of memory. It looks at a number of different people, of whom all participated and experienced the same overall situation, and their respective recollections and how they feel about both these and the bigger picture of things. Some can miraculously re-call events from the event that brings them all together, that being the 1982 Lebanon War, others cannot recollect anything at all and feel compelled to seek out those that'll help remind them, whereas others seem more haunted by, and talk about, the dreams that were a result of this conflict.The film is wandering and disjointed, but it is with the greatest of respects that I say that because the artistic license here compliments the subject matter. The film persistently blurs the lines between what would be either a documentary about a real-life event; a series of talking-head interviews; or a number of recollections, some of which would make both exceedingly effective and dramatic scenes all on their own had they not been entirely non-fictional anyway. But they are, and it's a credit to the film for being able to mesh together all this wavering content into an informative, humbling piece from a man that was there and is going through his own epiphany of sorts both on the screen and off it.The film does indeed cover Ari Folman, the man who interviews; journeys; remembers but also writes and directs his way to success in a piece that is entirely animated, which adds a further layer of the mystical. It is a piece that incorporates a sense of reality clashing with non-reality: dreams and nightmares not obviously linked to an event, but existing because of a true to life event. Ari travels from one location to another, stumbling across former comrades of the Israel Defense Force, with whom he served during the conflict, in a bid to get to the bottom of why he cannot recall his time, in 1982, in said conflict and regiment. His journey is inspired by Boaz, a man he interacts with in the very first scene in a bar, when he tells Ari of a re-occurring dream in which he is running away from a specific number of dogs. The dogs, in some symbolic-inspired manner, might represent repressed memories and one's feelings and fears linked to these repressed memories  a running away from; a refusal to confront through risk of being attacked and consumed by these memories and feelings, all the while linked to extreme feelings of guilt.The film acts as an anti-thesis to action films. It takes war and warfare as an item or generic convention; takes a step back, and observes it from a humbling and knowing perspective; it takes time to deconstruct those involved on the front-line of a war-zone; those whom were in and around gun fire and explosions, and informs us of how they feel years on from such a concoction of events and troubling interactions. The first recollection of the conflict the film provides us, and Ari, with; is a tale of how one ex-soldier was facing overwhelming odds on a beach during and was forced into the sea, thus to swim away from any potential battling. While structured with your, some might say 'typical' action conventions with its point of view angles and hand-held camera, the whole sequence refuses to epitomise the typical action hero; instead opting for an atypical generic instance in which the character will run away, or indeed retreat, further distancing the film, very early on, from action genre convention.Waltz With Bashir is a film-maker attempting to share thoughts, feelings and questions. One might say its 'proper' use of animation technology and mass-European based funding should act as a lesson to 2006 French film Renaissance, whose dazzling imagery was lost under a somewhat empty and soulless exercise in narrative and study. Waltz With Bashir is anything but lacking in feeling and clarity; a humbling and enlightening exercise in which the lead quickly establishes the notion of framing and looking through the camera into another world; their world, their memories and their feelings towards it. Don't bore me, talk down to me or lecture me with pseudo text-book-fodder-pieces like Waking Life; don't drown me in meandering narrative with pieces like Renaissance; just do what Waltz With Bashir does: take an idea, an artistic approach and execute it with a very personal aplomb. For a companion piece, check out 2007's Beaufort; another burning, brooding and engaging Isreali film in which the realities of soldiers in conflict are explored."
32,Waltz with Bashir,10,22 February 2009,This is the stuff dreams are made out of,"Ari Folman's Vals Im Bashir is an exceptional film of the highest echelons of vanguard art. Certainly the most valuable contribution by any individual to the cinema of 2008, this film is both immensely powerful, but also expressive. With minimal back-story this is not a retelling of history proper or a documentary, it is in fact an unreliable, subjective account of soldiers' memories of experiences in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. The haunting images Folman selects reproduce with vivid authenticity, the devastating effects of war not only to soldiers and civilians, but on collective memory, the historical record, and the very process of storytelling. History's unreliable memory has hindered individual and collective healing after the Lebanese massacre, the whole ordeal, having been buried somewhere deep in the collective conscience of the Israeli nation. The film is therapeutic in recovering elements of Ari's consciousness to the surface of his thoughts and in retelling the forgotten tragedy of the Country's most recent past."
33,Waltz with Bashir,,7 February 2009,"Perhaps the most riveting, beautiful, and surreal Animated Motion Picture ever made","Waltz With Bashir is perhaps one of the most important films of the decade. It creates a new type of style for animated films, foreign films, and even documentaries. It has powerful writing and a strong sense of direction and force. The images and surreal world it creates is such a powerful thought that gets copied in your head. The animation designs, the images, the sound, they are so beautiful, and at the same time very disturbing, very realistic, but so fantastical. I found watching this film a real event. It is, no doubt, the most visually stunning film in years. No effects, no devices used, but the cinematography the images have, the editing of the stories is so strong.It is not enough to read about this film, but to experience it. Please, go watch it in a movie theater, where it should stay for whoever wants to see it. Possibly one of the best animated films I have ever seen."
34,Waltz with Bashir,9,15 January 2009,A powerful piece that uses its unique style to effectively describe the flaws of bot human memory and humanity,"It's difficult to appropriately say that this movie is ""enjoyable"" because, taken as a whole, it is a very intense and emotional piece of film-making. From the start it certainly grabs you by the collar, with its dramatic opening sequence in which the streets of Beirut are introduced to a thumping Max Richter score. You know that you are watching an animation but, seeing the beautifully-composed 3D imagery as the scene pans rapidly down a deserted road, your mind finds itself momentarily tricked into accepting the silver tarmac and yellow skies as real footage. And then the dogs arrive; twenty-six hellhounds charging their way through the city to mete out revenge on their executioner. By beginning this 'documation' with images from his friend's recurring nightmare, writer-director-producer Ari Folman perfectly sets the tone for the journey upon which the audience is about to embark; it is also the logical starting point for his own story, the realisation that he is not haunted by flashbacks or dreams from the 1982 Israel-Lebanon war, that, in fact, he remembers nothing of his participation in the conflict. In an attempt to confront his forgotten past, Folman travels to meet various individuals who were also involved in the war and begins to catalogue their responses and recollections, indulging in what his friend suggests might be a therapeutic exercise. As he gradually teases- out his repressed memories it becomes apparent that the pivotal moment of his experiences - and the last piece of the puzzle to be recovered - centres on the Sabra and Shatila massacre, in which hundreds of Palestinian refugees were systematically executed over the course of three days. Although the project began as a personal experiment, what results has far greater implications and becomes a tale that reaches beyond the lives of just those nine individuals who appear in the film - it grows into a polemic on the insanity of war and the way in which the human mind copes with inhuman situations. Folman's work is at home among the similar oeuvres of Copolla, Kubrick and Heller but it also stands out from such cultural landmarks for two key reasons: not only are the themes real but the events themselves are recounted first-hand, compiled and interpreted visually by the very individuals who endured them; and, furthermore, the power of this, rather than being diminished, is wholly enhanced by the juxtaposition of the topic and its animated portrayal.It is in the seamless blending of dreams, memories, hallucinations and reality that the choice to use an animated medium really comes to the fore. The same images could feasibly be shot as a traditional documentary but, in that format, the reconstructions of nightmares and teenaged combat would lose their potency and would even risk appearing superficial. However, by relying on a stunning blend of bold yet muted colours, 3D Flash scenery and traditional cell animation, the borders between reality and fiction - true memories and false - become blurred for the audience just as they had for the director. It is also poignant that, when pursuing his story in Holland, Folman is told that he can sketch his school friend playing with his son, but he cannot record footage of them  this represents a truth for the film as a whole; by employing animation, the protagonists are permitted a degree of distance from both the past and the final product. Even though two of the characters are voiced by actors employed to read the transcripts of actual individuals, it is apparent that the testimonials come from the heart with an honesty that the element of relative anonymity offers.And the testimonials are harrowing  the paralysing fear of war, penitence over the spilling of innocent blood, guilt for fallen comrades, desperation, survival and terror; the horror of being an inactive witness to genocide. For all the bleakness of the material, Waltz with Bashir balances each anguishing moment with a supremely evoking visual style and no shortage of humour. It is not by accident that the film takes its name from a scene in which all three of these elements are portrayed in harmony  as a soldier dances erratically in the middle of a road, firing his machine gun wildly in a blind rage and balletically dodging a hail of bullets, insanity is beautifully and comedically depicted.Ultimately, the film remains balanced in this way until its true point is ready to be made. As the final scenes of the animation unfold and Folman's last outstanding flashback returns, wails of mourning fill the air as black-clad Shi'ite women lament the loss of their families. And then you realise, as the images switch from animation to actual footage of the massacre's aftermath, that the voices are genuine, the wailing is authentic and the pain is utterly and horrifically real. As with Folman's life, the film is pregnant until this point with the conspicuous absence of that one remaining scene and, as the screen fades to black, you are suddenly confronted with the message that has been lingering out of reach throughout, just like his own memory."
35,Waltz with Bashir,,3 January 2009,Waltz With Bashir,"Israeli filmmaker,Ari Folman, takes a trip down repressed memory lane with his animated film about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and his unit's role in the massacres at the Sabra and Shatila camps outside Beirut.In short, nine days before President-elect, Bashir Gemayel was to take office, he was assassinated. In retaliation, the Christian Phalangists (with no objections from the Israeli Defense Forces) entered the Sabra and Shatila camps. Ari Folman's unit fired flares into the night skies to help the Phalagists see their way into the camps. In this attack, the IDF killed 700 to 3,500 Palestinians, many were women and children.This is an excellent film and worthy of seeing on the big screen. Folman shows how the war has impacted his life. Nightmares that haunt him are animated perfectly. I heard Folman interviewed on NPR yesterday. He said the only way to make this film was through animation since it goes back in forth in time and dream sequences. Moreover, he wanted to attract a young as well as older audience. Here is a what he said on NPR: ""For me, it was very essential to bring young audiences to the theaters to watch the film because I thought that if this film could influence even one teenager making the decision not to go the war, it doesn't matter where I did my job, I earned it,"" Folman says. ""All wars are useless  and sometimes in films we tend to glorify them by making all of those great characters and they show you it's all about bravery and brotherhood of man. And I don't believe in that."" And I do hope that high school kids thinking about joining our military see this film. War is not glorious. Ask anyone who has been in one.Folman mentions in the interview that his father did not want him to make the film out of fear Israel would never forgive him and he would be ostracized. Surprisingly, Folman said the exact opposite has happened. The politicians and government have welcomed him with open arms.After viewing the film, I thought for sure it must have been met with opposition by the Israeli government. It surely does not paint the Israeli Defense Forces in a sympathetic light. Anyway, go check out this film. And if you want more information on the invasion of Lebanon or assassination of Gemayel, check out Wikipedia. It is a fascinating read. Furthermore, it helps explain what is happening now in the region."
36,Waltz with Bashir,,24 July 2013,Effectively structured and delivered,"This film was a big deal quite a few years ago now and pretty much since then I have told myself that I should watch it because it is supposed to be very good. Of course the subject matter made my lazy, stupid brain always take easier options when it came to picking from the queue and as such Waltz with Bashir has kicked around at the bottom of a drawer for quite some time now waiting to be watched. I finally got over myself this week and did so and I really didn't enjoy the experience although of course this is precisely how it should have been.The film is a tough watch as it reconstructs memories from the protagonist and his friends who were all involved in the Lebanon War in the late 80's. It starts out slowly and takes the form of an documentary where we have the characters relating their experiences back to us through interviews (although mostly they are discussions). This device is common in documentary films and are supported by stock footage of the events; in this case the delivery is different as the film is animated so we are able to see events as they occurred in the character's experience, not just representative footage. This works very well and allows for some really cinematic shots but also the best shot selection as anything is possible in animation. The film builds through the stories and generally it is as horrifying as it is engaging  it is a series of well told stories and it works very well because you listen even when it is difficult to do so.It isn't fun and it isn't easy but it is visually very well made and the whole structure and delivery of the film is engaging and brutal. It is a great war film, a great animation  just generally a great film."
37,Waltz with Bashir,10,20 August 2009,"Waltz of Death on the Streets of Beirut, September 1982","Ari Folman's Waltz with Bashir (2008), a unique combination of Animation/Documentary/Biography/ Drama/ War is not easy to watch and almost impossible to forget. It is original and unusual but in its core it reminded me of a film from many years ago that explored persistence of memory which can't be stopped or avoided - ""Muriel"" (1963) directed by Alain Resnais. One of ""Muriel"" characters is a former soldier who was hunted by the memories of the war in Algiers and the local girl tortured and killed by the French soldiers. As in Muriel, the main theme of the Israeli film is reality vs. memory of it. Can we always trust ourselves with what we remember? Does our memory reflect the events the way they really happened or our vision of them is altered as time passes and new realities inevitably enter our lives? Ari Folman and his team use an innovative technique to tell the harrowing story. It is the first time, a film-maker blends documentary and animation, history and fiction to create such powerful, tragic yet beautiful film which I simply can't stop thinking about. By making himself a character of the film who tried to understand why he has no recollections of the events he had been a participant in some and an eyewitness to the others, and gradually unveiling the long hidden unbearable truth, it seems Folman made the film as a metaphor for the whole country trying to block from memory a very dark, difficult, controversial and shameful page in its history that is known as The Sabra and Shatila massacre. It was carried out between September 16 and 18, 1982 by the Lebanese Forces Christian militia group, following the assassination of Phalangist leader and president-elect Bashir Gemayel. It is not the purpose of this short review to comment on the Sabra and Shatila massacre. I just want to point out that the information available from the different Internet sources is not always complete. A very important fact has been omitted from Wikipedia that ""Israeli troops allowed the Phalangists to enter two refugee camps, Sabra and Shatila to root out terrorist cells believed located there. It had been estimated that there may have been up to 200 armed men in the camps working out of the countless bunkers built by the PLO over the years, and stocked with generous reserves of ammunition. When Israeli soldiers ordered the Phalangists out, they found hundreds dead (estimates range from 460 according to the Lebanese police, to 700-800 calculated by Israeli intelligence). The dead, according to the Lebanese account, included 35 women and children. The rest were men: Palestinians, Lebanese, Pakistanis, Iranians, Syrians and Algerians.""This is a very sad and powerful movie that left a lasting impression on me but I understand that not all viewers feel the same way. My husband kept saying, ""So what? What new did they say? The War, any war is dirty, unglamorous and destroying for every side involved. Thousands of innocent die tragically. The war brings shame and guilt, remorse and nightmares to the soldiers who follow orders."" I agree with him but I understand why the director Ari Folman who is a Veteran of the First Lebanon War has made the film and what he tried to achieve. For almost 27 years, the debates have never stopped regarding the responsibility of Israeli military for the massacre because the Sabra and Shatila camps had been under the control of The Israeli Defense Force (IDF). By the words of Folman, his goal was not naming the guilty parties but trying to understand what is going on with these who fought as the Israeli soldiers during the First Lebanon War in Beirut and saw the results of horrors with their own eyes. Explaining why he chose to make the film as a documentary in the animated format, Ari said that animation had given him the necessary freedom in his creative process and the chance to blend the facts of reality with the perceptions, feelings and deeply hidden images in the memories of the retired soldiers- his friends and comrades whose recollections of these few days in September of 1982 as well as his own made the film possible. The technique which is actually a combination of Adobe Flash cutouts and classic animation has produced simple, gripping and fascinating images. The atmosphere is surreal to which the dark disturbing color scheme appropriately contributes. The visual originality and innovation are accompanied by sorrowful haunting soundtrack and the songs written for the film that add to the deep emotional impact the movie made on me."
38,Waltz with Bashir,9,4 April 2017,"Inner turmoil, animated and true","""Waltz with Bashir"" is a documentary that uses very unique devices for the genre. And I don't mean only the fact that it's an animation. Fictional movies depicting real life events are often held back by their documentary style, but this one is a documentary elevated by its strongly fictional style of storytelling that leans on its psychologically fascinating structure, artistic visual qualities and effective, often very beautiful soundtrack.The biggest accomplishment here is the fact that ""Waltz with Bashir"" isn't only about the historical viewpoints of the Lebanon war and the personal journey presented. It transcends that initial premise and becomes a universal, effective story about conflict, about human nature and our violence."
39,Waltz with Bashir,9,4 January 2016,powerful movie,"Boaz is haunted by 26 dogs chasing him. As an Israeli soldier fighting in Lebanon, his job is to take out the dogs since he's unable to kill people. Ari Folman has blocked out many memories from his days fighting there. Boaz's story has waken something in his brain. He starts searching for his past by talking to old comrades about their time in Lebanon and discover the truth about what happened in Beirut.This is a harrowing animated historical recounting of a devastating incident and a devastating war. The war stories are as powerful as any of the great anti-war movies. It takes apart a war, memories and a massacre. It is a powerful movie."
40,Waltz with Bashir,10,24 December 2015,The horror ! The horror !,"'Waltz with Bashir' is an animated documentary written and directed by Ari Folman. The film follows Folman in his search for his lost memories from the time when he served in the Israeli army during the traumatic Lebanon War of 1982.The first thing that I realised while watching 'Waltz with Bashir' is the fact that the animation was absolutely indispensable and this film could never have been made in any other possible way. This is because although this is at the basic level a documentary, but Folman takes a lot of artistic liberty to recreate the real life events and these recreations would never have been possible without the medium of animation. So the animation actually enhances and assists Folman's storytelling instead of sticking out as a gimmick. Thanks to the meticulous animation and the visual attention to detail, the whole film looks gorgeous. Every still shot can be framed and laminated to admire the beauty that is on show. The surreal imagery of the animation will stay with me for a long, long time. Folman uses the animation to juxtapose the beauty of the visuals with the devastating nature of the events during the war that the visuals were capturing. There are multiple haunting images and shots which are devastating to watch like certain scenes in 'Schindler's List'.The screenplay for the film and the subject is deep and thematically rich. Although Folman never shies away from the heavy nature of the subject matter, but Folman's style keeps the film vibrant and energetic throughout. Even viewers who generally tend to avoid war films will find this engrossing.The primary themes running through the film are the loss of innocence and guilt. We see Folman interview other men who like him served in the Lebanon War. We see these men recall the horrors of war that they had to witness when they were just young boys pushed into this hellish environment. Pretty much all the stories and interviews are interconnected. All the stories underline the madness and the futility of war. The stories also establish the mental struggles that these war veterans have had to deal with after coming back. The singular element that connects these mental issues of most of these men is the element of guilt. The guilt of having to kill human beings and also the guilt of surviving the war when many of their colleagues couldn't. Water bodies like the ocean play an important and symbolic role in many of their stories. Folman uses this aforementioned theme of guilt very craftily and uses it to connect the issues concerning the nation of Israel as a whole in the political scenario with the personal issues troubling the individuals covered in this film.Another very relevant theme dealt with by Ari Folman is the dynamic nature of memories. He explores and establishes that someone's memories can be fabricated by others or by himself/herself. A person can choose to completely forget certain aspects of his/her life because of certain subconscious assumptions. 'Waltz with Bashir' is an artistic masterpiece. Its substance and style go hand in hand and complement each other instead of one submerging the other. It is a political film that is ambitious in its style and becomes more than just about politics and war. It becomes a transcendental work about human emotions."
41,Waltz with Bashir,9,25 September 2015,Why not perfect?,"I am usually rating movies based on their genre. Since there are few animated documentaries around, this by itself would place Vals Im Bashir pretty high, but while I was trying to find flaws in the film, I realized that I am having difficulty doing that. Perhaps the only one that makes sense is that the animation is very basic, Adobe Flash like, other than that, it is something that touches on both factual and emotional level, without being heavy handed.To put it in perspective, it is the story of an Israeli man trying to understand why he forgot what happened during the war in Lebanon and his journey to remembering. It is not a propaganda film, but a personal documentary film of the director's journey: the man in the film.I can only recommend it."
42,Waltz with Bashir,7,19 October 2008,"Decent storytelling, poor animation","Although I doubt it gives an ""objective"" account of events (and you never get the impression it's supposed to) it does a good job of showing the more chaotic side of war. The movie gives an impression that the Israeli soldiers are frustrated, horny, confused, scared and that they never quite know what they're doing - like when a group of soldiers are riding an armored vehicle just holding down the triggers of their automatic weapons, shooting wildly for hours and hours - or the bizarre ""dance"" that the movie is named for.No witty banter or everyday language at all is exchanged between the soldiers, instead contrast to the hellish events of war is provided by the interviews with the veterans.All in all, the story is well crafted and the movie is an enriching experience.The choice of animation as a medium, however, seems kind of poorly motivated -- I guess it was a choice made to slim down the budget, because the style of the movie strives to look realistic and it's not hard to imagine it being done as a regular film.Although the animators show potential, the movie is riddled with flaws - from simple errors of craftsmanship (heads too big, hands too small, wonky poses, too-smooth movement and so on) to all too obvious time-savers (the smoking in the bar scene at the beginning was downright painful to watch) that all combine to make sure this movie doesn't get the ""it looks the way it's supposed to look""-feel, a feel you seem to get so much easier with conventional film.It reminds me of last year's ""Persepolis"" which had a great story to tell and mostly good animation, but was sadly ruined by poor pacing and a really cheap-sounding soundtrack."
43,Waltz with Bashir,5,6 February 2009,Comics in the way....,"Sound track of this film is a very strong part of the presentation. The marijuana and porn scenes, actually are conducive to express the repression of the memories. (Combination of the words were intended here.) The most powerful dynamic in the film is this very subtle, not explicit, but inconspicuously obvious 'delegation of responsibilities'. Hierarchy/vicious circle of sources of the instances, which instigate/arrange the violence 'by proxy'. Public expects the government to protect, but Sharon/Begin let it happened almost by default. Army encircles and watches standing back, the killers (""Christian"" phalangists) act with expectation to be without any responsibility and end up being sacrificed themselves in more than one way. The Israeli boys, who were sent to implement the political goals of the government end up with nightmares and maimed souls.Nobody is guilty and, as usual, everybody is. The film doesn't answer any questions and isn't designed to give any answers. Just that: we always are guilty together. If we keep silent it will continue for ever. This project deserves all the awards - the most important one would be, in my opinion, for the courage to start this theme. I am afraid though - there will be no continuation of this discussion/topic any time soon....."
44,Waltz with Bashir,10,17 August 2010,Not as funny as Team America but equally ironic,"I just finished watching Waltz With Bashir and it really shook me up. In it I felt the rage of Full Metal Jacket but much more intensely. FMJ was projected primarily through the eyes of a passive observer. We saw the result of horror but not the cause except for the execution of a wounded prisoner in the last scene.In WWB murder is in the very first scene, viewed through the eyes of the murderers. The murderers were children with 2 years of mandatory play fighting thrown suddenly into a war by the decision of a few mad elders from their tribe. The victims a family of no significance, their history to the murderers lost in a memory too painful to bare.Trapped in a bliss of social norms like so many examples in history the main character finally wakes from a living nightmare 20 years later. He begins his painful quest to recall those memories from combat, but he can't do it alone, on his own all he finds are repeating nightmares. So he begins to reach out to other people who were there at the time. He travels back and forth in time through his combat days through a series of interviews of past participants. They give more names, some add to the his story and some are dead ends. But slowly the full horror of those days and his participation in them is painted in stark relief.The film is a look at Israel's 1980's war in Lebanon and their direct involvement in the genocide of Palestinians during that time. The children of the survivors of death camps of WWII helping to make death camps for a different cultural group. Safe in the knowledge they had no choice, they were forced to do it. Of course like most barbarous acts most participants are basically zombies by the time they are asked to help.. All are involved to the extent of their actions and active inactions but it's the ones who seem ""together"" who happily volunteer to ""give cover fire"" that are scariest for me.I found it so very hard to watch having seen Downfall a few days earlier.We see history play out almost reel for reel when painted in the light of WWII. The deniers, the ""had too's"" the ""I thought it was someone else"", the ""who cares"", and the ""they're animals for slaughter"", all expressed through interview and memories of distant voices.There is no redemption in the movie. No one is saved, no one is forgiven, no attempt at any amends. Instead we are given a deeply profound insight into the true horror of war without a filter to protect us.But of course seen only through the eyes of survivors, the victims leave us with an empty sadness but no foot print in our collective memories. Not a single victim's name is even remembered, in fact not one scene ever tries to look at the victims for more than a passing glance, they weren't human so the brain won't focus to remember, they're just victims, easy to forget. Completely normal behavior for an overwhelmed child, psych 101.The people of Germany waited until almost all the perpetrators of war crimes died before any apology was given to the victims. We are never allowed to hear the lessons of the perpetrators of war, the discussion is always closed until death. They don't even tell us why. History tells us what the leaders said but not what was in the mind of the people who carried out the instructions. Did they feel good about it? Would they do it again? If they knew today what they know now, would they have done things differently? Did they even give it a second thought?No wonder massacres will happen again and again. We have no way to figure out how to stop them, our parents are too ashamed to say anything and stay mute instead of giving us guidance like we hope for them to do.Waltz With Bashir is a potent and painful journey. Don't watch it alone and make sure to talk about it after. Talk therapy immediately after a traumatic event is very important.10/10"
45,Waltz with Bashir,10,12 June 2010,A one of a kind movie,"Quite possibly my favorite movie from 2008, along with ""Wall-E"" and ""The Dark Knight"".. Using some incredible animation, Waltz with Bashir is a one-of-a-kind take on a war movie. Behind such wonderful animation lies a truly compelling film that tells the chilling tale of an Israeli soldier's first past. Using the memories of the main character, the movie has a surreal quality to it that dazzles the eye and mind. The well written narration that accompanies works with it incredibly well, too.However, the movie does lag at a few points, only due to repetition in maybe 2 or 3 spots. Otherwise, it's an excellent movie that deserves everyone's recognition."
46,Waltz with Bashir,10,20 December 2009,The amazing Waltz with Bashir,"This new film from Israel, a mixture of animation-cum-docu-drama, could be summed up in these words: It's an amazing, unique feat with sheer mesmerizing wonder.Rarely has a rotoscoped animation (remember Waking Life & A Scanner Darkly?) been so captivating and proved to have used the 2D medium so wisely. The film's about a war veteran who lost his memories of his days in the Lebanon War back in the 80s, and the rotoscoped animation does exceedingly well in illustrating the surreal-nature of his haunted memories as he attempts to piece together his past through interviews with other veterans and people involved in the war.Throughout the film, we see sequence after sequence of stories of the Lebanon War pieced together by war veterans, reporters, and even from the protagonist himself as he recollects his lost memories. These sequences are beautiful, surreal, and mesmerizing, and coupled with the wondrous orchestral music, they make for an extraordinary, spine-chilling experience. You'll have to see it for yourself to ""get"" it.It's a rare honour to have come across a powerful film of such subtle magnitude. Ari Folman, the director (as the main war veteran protagonist) did an exceedingly good job in directing and acting in the film. Needless to say, the animation (mix of 2D, Flash & 3D) is the strongest point of the film - very fluid, realistic and consistent throughout - fitting the whole notion of how memories are often idealized/beautified in our minds adequately.My rating for ""Waltz with Bashir"": 10/10"
47,Waltz with Bashir,8,9 April 2009,Moving,"Whoever said animated movies are just for kids, doesn't know his anime, but should be convinced that there are animated movies with a mature thinking/idea behind them. Waltz with Bashir (int. Title of the movie) is by far the best example for this. A documentary completely drawn, but as moving as a ""real"" picture.I don't know all the facts, but I'm pretty sure the movie is as close to real facts as it can be. The ""questioning"" of people who have witnessed things couldn't feel more realistic. Because of the subject matter, this won't appeal to everyone. And although it was nominated for a best animated picture Oscar, it was obvious that the (at least equally good, but more entertaining) Pixar movie WALL-E would walk away with that crown ..."
48,Waltz with Bashir,10,17 February 2009,The Real Cartoon,"This extremely formalistic and visually stunning film has done the impossible by beautifully portraying the harsh and inhumane realities of war. As a psychology major, I was very interested with the memory problems the protagonist was facing due to what I assume was post traumatic stress disorder. When exposed to something as unbelievable as the systematic annihilation of a group of people, one may find it hard to really determine the difference between reality or fantasy. I believe no war story can ever be told in a way that will get a person to fully comprehend the feeling and truths of senseless killing. The use of the transforming the animation into real life footage at the end explains this concept well. We are so unattached from these war crimes that we view them as we would a cartoon. It is sad to see people dying, but we do not actually feel their pain; everything looks too pretty. Then we are slapped in the face as the main character regains his memory with gruesome real-life footage of the innocent dead. This film is moving, it educates and it reveals facts about life and death that people find hard to come to grips with. The content and presentation of this movie should be loved and hated, enjoyed and feared"
49,Waltz with Bashir,10,16 February 2009,I love this film,"Waltz with Bashir is a 2008 Israeli animated documentary film written and directed by Ari Folman. Folman, a 1982 Lebanon War-veteran, attempts to recover his memories of the massacre, which he documents through the film. The film follows Folman in his conversations with friends, a psychologist and the reporter Ron Ben-Yishai who was in Beirut at the same time. It is important to take note of the themes, symbols and characters represented in ""Waltz with Bashir"" along with the reality of the 1982 Isreali invasion of Lebanon. The collateral damage (damage that is uninteneded/incidental to the intended outcome) of the Sabra and Shatila massacre is catastrophic. First of all, the assassination of Bashir, the president-elect of Lebanon, led to an explosion of anger, and Christian militia men from the Lebanese Forces carrying out the massacre killing an estimated 3,500 people. Bashir represented the demise of the Palestinians. Air Folman, made references to real-life historical figures using his animation. Regarding, leit-motif, the prime minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, is seen repeatedly. Although it his identity is never clearly stated, his recurring appearance, as a little man with glasses, was Folman's way of including his presence in the film. Another character who is unidentified is prime minister Ariel Sharon. While sleeping, he receives a call from a concerned soldier reporting about the massacre; he simply thanks the man for the information and goes back to sleep.The feature-length documentary was made almost entirely by means of animation, combining classical music, 80s music, realistic graphics and surrealistic scenes, taking four years to complete. The only part of the film that was not in animation, was the short segment at the every end, showing documented results of the Sabra and Shatila massacre in a news archive footage by Ron Ben-Yishai. This unexpected, drastic switch from formalism to realism gives the audience a complete ""slap in the face,"" letting reality set it. This switch was selected at the perfect time of the content curve, that is, the peak of the scene when the audience has gotten the most out of it. With the use of animation, ""Waltz with Bashir"" is a formalistic approach to realism. They used dark colors, setting the tone of the film. This stylized view gives viewers the distance to take in information and review what is going on, while reality catches us off guard, leaving a huge impact. The unique style invented by Yoni Goodman and the Bridgit Folman Gang studio, is a combination of Flash cutouts and classic animation. Each drawing was sliced into hundreds of pieces, which were moved in relation to one another, creating the illusion of movement. The original soundtrack was composed by musician Max Richter. The music plays an active role as commentator on events instead of simple accompaniment."
50,Waltz with Bashir,9,16 February 2009,An energy packed movie,"A surreal war movie. This movie is unique because it's a cartoon but a realist film. I enjoyed going with the character in figuring out his past. The film has film theories integrated into it like the line of action camera movement which differs from classic cartoons. What I'm trying to say is that this film is feature film quality not an after school special cartoon. I also enjoyed when that giant naked girl picked up the guy from the yacht, kind of like saving him, and took him away. In the end it gets grim when the film shows actual footage from the war. The music was fabulous and it went well with the movie. After watching the movie and discussing it in class I realized many things. I realized how something so shocking can be blocked in someone's head. I also realized that in war things can go wrong, people start to question war, people loose control, people can do amazing things, like when there was a forgotten soldier, he hid behind a boulder then when safe ran to the ocean and swam his way back to his group."
51,Waltz with Bashir,10,16 February 2009,(Animated) War Is Hell,"This is a film that is guaranteed to be a lightning rod for controversy (with lots of finger pointing & shouting ""I beg your pardon...but""). The story concerns a middle aged man, who during his tenure with the Isreali Army,was involved in the war against Lebanon in 1982/83, that triggered the surge of the PLO. The audio track is a series of filmed interviews by the director with the battle scarred veterans of the war, then converted to animation (standard cell animation,3D-CGI & flash animation),like Richard Linklater did for 'Waking Life'. The film also dramatizes the surreal & disturbing dreams of some of the soldiers. Many truths/half truths,are revealed in this powerful & disturbing drama. Note:Despite the fact that this is an animated feature film, this is absolutely not...repeat NOT a film for children,or war veterans that could possibly be freaked out by some of the horrors that are depicted in this film,due to PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film serves up disturbing war carnage,graphic & bloody violence,language & a brief animated sequence of a pornographic video. Again,not for the little ones."
52,Waltz with Bashir,9,16 February 2009,"Extremely accurately drawn, Great movie","I've seen nearly all kinds of animation the movie industry has to offer. Waltz with Bashir, however, has an animation that caught me into a trance of amazement. The animation was visually appealing to the eye as it is nearly a spitting image of reality. From the opening scenes, you could sense where the direction of the film was heading towards. The film has a different point of view from your typical military movies.The movie is about real-life incidents as director Ari Folman, tries to uncover his repressed memories of the Lebanon war. Folman travels to different parts of the country to try to seek answers to his relapse of forgotten events. As he goes around to places where his former war mates reside, he finds that they too do not have any recollection of parts of the war. The audience is given different clips of flashbacks as Folman tries to patch up his distant past.I would recommend this movie and would not be surprised if it wins many awards."
53,Waltz with Bashir,10,16 February 2009,Waltz with a memorable movie,"For the people who like war movies mixed with some type of political statement... this is your movie. At the beginning of the movie, the protagonist is not known, but it is used in order to focus on the opening scene. The main theme of the movie is of memory and how our brain interpreted memory. The story starts to develop over the lost memory of Ari, a young soldier who has one memory of the war. The film is shot in animation, which is a wise choice because of the topic of the film. If the film was shot in ""real life"", it would be to outrageous and I couldn't lose myself in the film. In the film there's a scene, in which a soldier returns fire and starts to dance the waltz in order to dodge the bullets, these scene would have been outrageous of it was shoot with real actors. During the film, I was amused by the storyline and antics of the characters, so I felt detach of the actual events on the film, but when the film changes from animation to real world. It was shocking and I realized that the events actually happened and it was not just an isolated world. This film does not justify the action of a few soldiers and it does not simplify the ordeal of war for some soldiers. The film could have easily been another war genre movie, but it became more."
54,Waltz with Bashir,9,16 February 2009,"Visually amazing, heart racing, profound.","From the get-go I was emerged in the surreal world of Ari Folman's ""Waltz of Bashir."" (The opening scene being a dream sequence of a pack of wild dogs charging through urban cities and you're just along for the experience). I feel that there's a hidden beauty felt behind a stylized formalistic film when watched, specifically in this animated film. An awe sense of displacement and unfamiliar places are experienced as we're taken through the journey of a former Israeli soldier to discover lost memories regarding his part of the Shatila/Sabra Massacre. For someone who was only vaguely familiar with the 1982 events in Palestine, I was completely connected to this film more as a student because I believe that the human experience behind war/atrocities/events like this massacre bring out feelings and emotional collisions which affect every person on a very on a holistic scale. For that, the emotional impact on this film is staggering. From the narrative documentary style we follow along to the cutting of the animated war battles and surreal shots of fragmented memories of a bewildered soldier, the entire impact of this animated film touched on spiritual, emotional, and social ideas that makes one wonder about the state of the world in which we live in. I do highly recommend this movie to everyone."
55,Waltz with Bashir,10,8 February 2009,a visually striking and emotionally powerful film.,"This a very unique and powerful documentary in how the story unfolds visually and narratively. The story is told through the deeply buried memories and dreams of Israeli soldiers who fought in the 1982 war in Lebanon. The beautiful dreamlike animation lends itself perfectly to the content, not quite bringing the events to full reality until the very end when real footage is used. The score is also wonderfully evocative. It is an account of another harrowing chapter in the history of man's inhumanity, which is equally as important to be told and remembered as all the others, in hopes that it will serve as a lesson. This is an amazing piece of film making belonging in its own category, not deserving simply to be called a documentary."
56,Waltz with Bashir,9,15 January 2009,Waltz with Bashir,"A pack of snarling stray dogs bounds down city streets, saliva dripping from their bared fangs. At first there are only a few of them. Then more join, until there must be twenty or thirty. Cars swerve to avoid them. Mothers shrink back and shield their children from the sight of the beasts. What do they represent? Are they the dogs of war, sweeping through the streets, heralding coming battles and death? The pack arrives at an apartment building,. A lone man stands at a window, looks down at the dogs.Cut to a bar in Israel. Filmmaker Ari Folman sits with a friend, who is describing a recurring dream. The dogs are a part of this dream. Each of the twenty-six dogs (for he knows that there are twenty-six) represents a dog that he shot during the 1982 Lebanon War, to stop it from alerting its masters. After listening to his friend's dream, Folman is hit by a strange realisation: he has no recollection of his own involvement in the war. He knows that he fought, that he was a part of the Israel Defense Forces; but he has no actual memories of the conflict.So Folman sets out to recover them. He begins with a single image: it is night, he is wading in the sea, the cityscape is eerily let by flares. He tracks down the only other person he recognises from this image; and, from there, visits all his old friends, in an effort to reconstruct not only his own experience of the invasion, but a collective experience.So Waltz with Bashir is a documentary. But it is no normal documentary. Instead of the usual talking heads and archive footage, it is entirely animated. (There are one or two talking head segments, but these, too, are animated.) Folman's style is stark, with ample use of noirish chiaroscuro that gives the film an almost expressionist feel. The relative realism of Folman's visits with his friends contrasts with the often surreal style and imagery of their accounts of the war. Waltz with Bashir owes more to Apocalypse Now than Saving Private Ryan.The use of animation might seem odd to some, even pretentious. But given the harrowing subject matter, especially in the Sabra and Shatila massacre, it really drives home the horrors of war. It is reminiscent of Isao Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies (1988): both films use animation to portray the deeply disturbing effects of war. What is usually a medium for cutesy kids' stuff is used to show to the audience graphic images of violence and death. It is this incongruity that makes Waltz with Bashir all the more horrible.It is also a deeply personal journey. Folman is Jewish, and in coming to terms with his involvement in what was essentially genocide, he is reminded of the Holocaust, an act of genocide through which he and his parents lived. Though he was not directly involved with the massacre in Lebanon, Folman is concerned that he may, in the words of one his friends, have ""played the part of the Nazi"".The massacre was actually carried out by Christian Phalangists, while the Israel forces (Folman among them) watched on and lit flares, so that the Phalangists could see who to shoot. Neither the Israel forces nor the Phalangists are demonised, and it could be argued that Folman isn't critical enough. Indeed, several scenes go as far as almost implying that the IDF's brutality was merely the result of youthful folly  a squad of soldiers fires round after round into a family car more out of fear than anything else. But the graphic and deeply saddened nature of the final scenes shows that Folman is on the side of neither the Israelis, nor the Phalangists, nor the Palestinians. He is one the side of humanity; and he, like us, prays that we can put an end to events like this."
57,Waltz with Bashir,9,4 December 2008,Animation renders cinema audience speechless,"Such was the impact of this movie that the audience left the cinema in silence.The film did not leave me disappointed though it was somewhat different than I had expected from the trailers.Waltz with bashir stood out for me in two ways. Firstly, the outstanding animation; though I cannot claim to be an expert in animation, this was surely animation at its best. There were a few scenes that were so real, portraying the fear and confusion of war so well. Secondly, the idea of making a documentary this way.In terms of the subject, the film leaves the Israelis with responsibility but no intentional involvement in the massacres. The soldiers are young and scared and the army lacked the communication to realise what was going on before it was too late.The music was great and varied in style between scenes; there were a few light moments and some comedy.The film switches from 'interview' mode to flashback mode; it seemed that much more effort was put in the latter and the rough animation made some of the characters in the interview a little southparkish.I greatly recommend watching this and will certain watch it again myself"
58,Waltz with Bashir,3,8 February 2010,A so-so film,"I've read many of the comments about this movie, and am sorry that I don't share the enthusiasm of many of you.I found the film incoherent and disappointing.Incoherent, because I don't understand what the movie is about.For most of the film, the theme seemed to be the precariousness of memory - the fact that memory is based as much on our imagination as on actual events. In the context of the violence and chaos of war and its brutalizing effect on its participants, memory is subtly and subconsciously shaped to enable participants a measure of subsequent sanity and coherence.If the film had explored this theme in some detail, it might have become a fascinating documentary. Unfortunately, this theme, once presented, is not explored in detail. We're offered a number of characters who simply don't (or can't stand to) remember much in the way of facts about the 1982 war with Lebanon. Nothing connects to anything else.The second theme is a visit to the sad tale of the Sabra and Shatila massacre. The film does not tell us anything about this sad tale that we didn't already know, nor does it expand on the opening theme of the precariousness of memory.I didn't care for the use of cartoon figures rather than real people in the movie. The use of cartoons greatly weakens the exploration of the opening theme of the fragility and precariousness of memory. How are we to judge the truth value of what cartoon figures tell us? Nor, in my opinion, does the use of cartoon figures do much for the massacre.If Mr Folman has no memory of his service as an active soldier other than his furloughs, the war must have been a horrifying experience for him - and I offer him my sympathy. But the film didn't do anything to deepen my understanding of the unending chaos and conflict in this part of the world in general, or the Sabra and Shatila massacre in particular."
59,Waltz with Bashir,1,15 May 2009,The point of view of the invaders,"israeli occupied LEBANON for 22 years, from 1978 to 2000, when it was forced to retreat under fire, the israelis never apologized for occupying LEBANON. This film portrays the devastation and the depression caused by this occupation, told by an israeli invader, it contains good quality animations, but lacks .... the truth. An Arab viewer will be very traumatized while while watching this animation movie, it brings back memories of black days specially when he is exposed only to half of the truth, specially that it is told by the invader. May be after the peace will have taken place in the middle east, this work will be regarded as a master piece, tracing the history of the war, but before piece, it will be only viewed as the invader trying to put the blame on the invaded nation."
60,Waltz with Bashir,8,7 October 2008,Waltz With Bashir - Do Films Change Peoples' Behaviour For the Better?,"I assume the most blasphemous insult an Israeli could make would be to label a Jew as a Nazi. And yet a character in the film ""Waltz With Bashir"" makes just such a claim for the Israeli soldiers who provided logistical support for the Phalangists who took part in the Shatila refugee camp massacres.This cold, clinical and analytical depiction of an Israeli soldier seeking to cobble together a recollection of his involvement in that exercise raises unpleasant resonances with the passive refusal by German citizens in the 1930's and 40's to acknowledge and oppose the actions their regime was taking against Jews.The film's protagonist has effectively repressed his memory of that night and it is only a conversation with a colleague that enables it to surface in the form of a dream  or flashback. The film depicts his endeavours to decode his unacknowledged responses to his peripheral involvement and subsequent tour through the aftermath of the slaughter in that refugee camp. These repressed recollections take the form of a walk out of the sea (of forgetfulness), up the beach and into the high rise urban environment of Beirut. As he and two colleagues take this walk, they pass through a horde of women heading in the opposite direction.The use of animation rather than documentary footage and talking heads gives the film a strikingly articulate voice. The characters take on that ghoulish, mythical stature that those garish, full colour comics give their caricatured inhabitants.Perhaps that is how the film maker has managed to get away with the implications of his work. Animation can allow its characters to make the most condemnatory statements without attracting libel charges and other retribution. Think of the depictions of the characters and the things they say in the first few seasons of the Simpsons television series. Perhaps the success of the Michael Moore docos has established an environment in which Americans are allowed to submit themselves and their culture to cinematic critical analysis. But when you consider the positively Dickensian monstrosity of the depiction of Mr Montgomery Burns and his cavalier approach to running a nuclear power plant facility you get a feel for what an animator can get away with.And yet the Simpsons deals largely with the comforts and shortcomings of domesticity.""Waltz With Bashir"" deals with an iconic demonstration of the propensity of civilized humans to condone and even engage in behaviour they would condemn as barbaric. The narrators' parents had been killed in German concentration camps during World War II and yet he is part of an Israeli military unit shooting flares into the night sky to provide illumination for the Phalangists to round up and kill their civilian victims.It seems to be a given that military encounters with civilians will eventually generate such outrages.Think of the images early in the film of Israeli soldiers firing wildly at a red Mercedes Benz car containing a family because they had been told that such a vehicle would be used as a car bomb.Think US Forces in Vietnam and My Lai, soldiers torching villages with Zippo lighters and killing humans and livestock in what they see as revenge for the casualties they have suffered.Likewise, it seems to be a given that remote civilian populations in whose name such military operations take place will be largely unconcerned with the ramifications of those actions for other human beings. Think of the attitude of the US electorate that kept voting for politicians whom they knew would continue the war until their living room television images of far off paddy fields and black pyjama clad Vietnamese were replaced with pictures of their neighbours being attacked by baton wielding cops at street demos and students being shot by the National Guard at Kent State University and elsewhere.It raises the question, ""can cinema change these sordid manifestations of human behaviour?"" The answer seems to be, ""NO!"" If you have seen the doco ""Hearts of Darkness"", you will be aware that Capola believed that his film ""Apocalypse Now"" would bring the US involvement to a halt. He got that wrong.Presumably Oliver Stone believed his Vietnam films, starting with ""Platoon"" would ensure that the US electorate would never allow another Vietnam. The spate of US films condemning the Iraq War show that hope to be groundless.In his September 2007 oration to the Melbourne University entitled , ""Jews, Statehood and Power, Israel and the Challenge to Jewish Morality"", author Michael Oren condemned his fellow citizens who were opting out of the moral contradictions that inevitably face an Israeli state and following in the footsteps of the hero in Spielberg's film, ""Munich"".He suggested that instead of turning their backs on a nation of Jews involving themselves in military escapades that gestate such horrors as the Shatila civilian massacres, they should involve themselves in the ongoing process of forming an Israeli culture based on traditional concepts of Jewish morality.He gave as an example of this approach a conversation he engaged in with his son who had been wounded in the course of military activities. He had suggested to his son that Israel should use its economic power to cut off supplies to Gaza. His son castigated him. That was not the Jewish mode of ethical and moral behaviour.Shortly after that oration, Israel cut off supplies to the Gaza Strip.There had already been another invasion of Lebanon. This time the results were condemned as disastrous by just about all Israelis.It would seem to be the case that it will not be films like ""Waltz With Bashir"" that change Israeli civilization so much as military failures."
61,Waltz with Bashir,,24 February 2009,no good,"Could have been a good animation, if it wasn't manipulative, especially towards the end. The only murderers in this war who seem to have religion are 'the Christian Phalangists'. One is ignorant if one cannot see that these abominations that we, as species, are capable of have nothing to do with religion or cultural identity, but with hatred and vanity concealed under ideological justifications. I trust the director could have done a much better work, if words like 'us and them' didn't resonate in his mind. Now a little quote, to whom it may concern :) 'Please allow me to introduce myself / I'm a man of wealth and taste. / I've been around for a long, long year / Stole many a mans soul and faith. / And I was round when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain. / Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate. / Pleased to meet you, Hope you guess my name / But whats puzzling you is the nature of my game' Sympathy for the Devil, The Rolling Stones"
62,Waltz with Bashir,7,10 April 2009,not everything I hoped for,"I am going to criticize this more than praise this, but lets start out with the good. I like the idea of memory and the way it was dealt with. The relationship of reality and memory was very interesting. The idea was fleshed out in a very interesting way that I enjoyed and that was its saving grace. I good build up and premises for the movie, but it well short after that. I know everyone talks about how well animated it was, but I am sorry I did not think it looked good. I think the fact that a lot of these people did interviews is great, but the thing that documentaries and interviews with these people can do is that I can place a face with them. Some of the most powerful moments in any film I have seen are scenes in documentaries and the people just do not have anything to say and it is all said in their expressions. This was lost because of the fact that the animation was not detailed. I know that there was supposed to be a point to this, but it removed a lot of the brevity of the situation for me. The end was supposed to shock the viewer and everything was supposed to lead up to the moment of reality, but it did not hit me as hard as it might have it was approached differently. The other thing is keep thinking that Waking Life got it right was the particular type of animation and I would have preferred to have seen that type of animation where there were no solid lines. To blur the lines of reality would have added to it. I do have to say there were a few scenes that were lighted very well the first one I can think of is that scenes in the woods. I think it tried to be poetic and powerful at the same, but did not succeed at either at the desired level."
63,Waltz with Bashir,,28 February 2009,I'm locked in forever . . .,"""The horror! The horror!"" Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness""I am not a big fan of war movies except for the realistic impact of the beach scene in Saving Private Ryan. Along comes the animated documentary, Waltz With Bashir, with impressionistic images of dazed Israeli soldiers invading Lebanon, and I'm locked in forever to the limbo between the abstract, removed sensibility of animated soldiers trying to remember a massacre and the palpable reality that it did occur. These unreal images are the reality, leached from my imagination into my memory as if I had been a witness as well. I can't forget the almost slow motion of the soldiers, floating like ghosts through fire and water to their horrific destiny.Like the drunken soldier of the title dancing and shooting in a circle near the image of assassinated Lebanese President Bashir Gemayel, director Ari Folman haltingly tries to revive the memory of a massacre that occurred at the time of that invasion. The slow revelation of abominations (Rashomon comes to mind), including his inadvertent slaughter of a family, is done so smoothly it is not immediately apparent we have lived through an epiphany of our own. The guilt of the Christian militia that perpetrates the massacre of thousands is never determined, nor is it clear how Israeli officers could have allowed the slaughter of Palestinian civilians. The unreal, animated imagery heightens the perception of the horrors.In one memorable scene, Ari and other soldiers emerge from the river like Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) in Apocalypse Now, as if they were sea horses moving silently to land. Although the massacre of a family that ensues is a minor prelude to the one to follow, the animation allows the very idea of primeval fear and terror to take imaginative formthe abstract nature of the image makes understanding easier than the grim reality of a Private Ryan, Blackhawk Down, or Full Metal Jacket.The reality is surreal; the surreal is reality. It could be thought that the surreal imagery compromises the reality, that the characters slip into abstraction because of the fanciful medium. So be it. Nothing about war and the attendant massacres is anywhere near the experience of ordinary, safe citizens like most of us who have not gone to war. I crumble with guilt that I have lived while so many innocents have died.Such is the power of Waltz With Bashir to evoke these thoughts. It deserves to have been nominated for a foreign-language Oscar."
64,Waltz with Bashir,7,17 February 2009,Unique and strategic way to retell the experience of war,"After watching the film, it definitely became the most disturbing and unique ways to retell someone's personal experience of war. The animation allowed me to not automatically turn my brain off to the connection of a war film since I have seen so many. It provided a way of escape so that I can just sit back and open my self up again to what war was like for another person. The animated characters were so detailed that I can see the lines on their face move as they were talking which made me believe the characters.The pornography in the middle of the film and the few dreams with naked people seemed like a way to add in entertainment value for most people to enjoy and actually distracted me from understanding the deeper themes in the film. The color scheme of certain scenes were very strategic to create different moods through the story and I thought that this film was the most creative films about war that I have ever seen. The content was so real and the way it was told had so many formalistic qualities to it but never taking away from its reality. The ending was great to switch to real life because it concluded everything I saw about war in the most effective way and left me thinking of how horrifying war really is."
65,Waltz with Bashir,9,6 January 2009,Dancing with painful truth,"It was really a strange time to watch a film directed by an Israeli director, about a mass extermination of Palestinian refuges in Lebanon, while another extermination was taking place in Gaza. Forgive my introduction, I don't stand against any religion or culture. But the timing was quite strange, if u add to the fact that Israel was always looking to clear up its name in history for that massacre. The 3000 dead Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sambra and Satilla, two days after the assassination of Bashir Gemajel, few days after his win in the elections of Lebanon, few days after the invasion of Israel in Beirut, few months after the invasion of Syria in Beirut, few years after the first invasion of Israel in Beirut, were the reason that Israel was kicked out of Lebanon, but, hey, they didn't do it, according to them, Lebanese Christians did it, known as Phalanx. Christians that grew really angry because of the death of their leader (Bashir) and thought that the bloody days their country was living (sadly, through Lebanon's history) was because of the Palestinians. Note, the Muslim Palestinians, not Christian, nor Jew. So, they had to go. But where to go to, since they were already running? The question was answered in the most horrible way. OK, but why is Israel to blame for that? There is Ari Folman's answer. And it is honest and painful for Israel.Ari Folman delivers a great film. It is not a film, it is actually a documentary. It is made with the most unusual way (animation)that delivers the loudest and most vivid anti-war message you have seen lately. The most powerful scene, the flare scene (wont say any more)is not a dream of any soldier, nor a false memory. He is not here to make propaganda of any kind. Even though colored with animation colors, violence and pain is all the same here, and u wont believe how ''real'' is the crying in the very end.In mid-September of 1982, the massacre was met with world-wide dismay. Maybe another Ari Folman will deliver another film about Gaza today. He is not digging into history to find the origins of anything during Israelian invasion in Beirut. Just some stories of some soldiers, mixed up with dreams, a will to forget but a duty not to. It is how art should be, even though it can't (and sadly, couldn't) prevent any new war.Watch it for this historical event, watch it for it's honesty, but also watch it because it's beautifully crafted, the animation is great and most fit with the ''dreamy-like'' sense of the film.(Forgive my English, for some expressions and names.)"
66,Waltz with Bashir,5,27 July 2012,"Great movie, shame about the propaganda","A great movie in any other aspect besides the fact it seems to have been made to tell the world Israel had nothing to do with the massacres and would have stopped them if only they knew they were going on. There is a line that says ""You were the one shooting the flares, not those carrying on the massacre"". And the main character claims not one Israeli soldier either participated in it or had a clue of what was going on - apart from Ariel Sharon, but it is easy blaming him now.If you do know a bit of history and can somehow get over this, it is a great movie to watch. But it just tells one side of the story and it is a bit too obvious."
67,Waltz with Bashir,9,1 March 2015,The subjective and fragile nature of memory,"I can honestly say that I've never seen anything quite like WALTZ WITH BASHIR before. It's animated, but it's also a documentary which recounts director Ari Folman's attempt to reclaim long-suppressed memories of his involvement in the Lebanon War. The animation-documentary combination is an odd one, but nevertheless it works extraordinarily well with what the filmmakers seemed to be going for here. Although it mostly deals with firsthand war experiences, the larger theme is the subjective and fragile nature of memory, particularly of the traumatic and painful variety. I don't really want to get into any specifics because to do so would spoil the impact. All I'll say is that this film builds rather slowly as different people are interviewed and details are revealed, and the climax is sure to provoke an emotional reaction. As far as the quality of the film is concerned, the animation is very well-done. The movement is a little odd at times, but this is due to them either using cut-outs or roto-scoping (maybe a combination of both?). I'm fairly certain that the interview scenes were based on actual film footage, but I could be wrong. The sequences in the past are distinguished from the present by having this watercolor-like, washed-out, yellow-tinged and dingy look, while the scenes in the present have more natural-looking color. Back to thematic content, there is also some discussion about dreams and how they relate to memory. And of course, since this film deals with a war (and massacre) issues of morality come up, if in a more subtle way than you might think. What I took away from this is that the Lebanon War (and Palestinian massacre) is something that weighs heavy on the Israeli/Jewish conscience. We as human beings tend to block out things from our memories that we find offensive and overly traumatic, and there probably is some cognitive dissonance between the very real atrocities visited on Jews in the past and the atrocities that they have inflicted, or at least passively observed being inflicted, on others. It should go without saying that this film deals with some very heavy subject matter, but it's very important that we as human beings are able to confront and deal with all memories, even the ones we'd like to forget."
68,Waltz with Bashir,9,5 January 2012,Utterly real,"The device whereby a character reconstructs past events by talking to those involved to build up a complete picture is well-worn. But 'Waltz with Bashir', in which an ex-Israeli soldier reconsiders the events surrounding the massacre of Palestinians that occurred in Lebanon in 1982, transcends its format brilliantly. It's an intelligent, profound reflection on the psychology of soldiers, the horrors of war, memory, and responsibility, as well as a dissection of a very specific tragedy. It's also an animation; and, in my opinion, one of the best ever made. The pictures are beautiful (yet horrific), but that's not the only reason the film is such a success. Many of even the most acclaimed animations fail to convey the subtlety of human facial expression; technically, 'Waltz with Bashir' doesn't either, but the way that the characters are drawn against the background quite brilliantly conveys their (usually ambiguous) emotions and mood. Animation allows the portrayal of what might have been difficult to reconstruct; but arguably, it also better captures events as seen through the filter of decayed memories and the desire to distance oneself from the horror than direct reconstruction could have done. And in an age when the use of computer graphics exposes us endlessly to hyper-reality, where everything looks superficially real (but in some deeper sense, fake), this simple cartoon does the reverse: there's a reality in these drawings that completely convinces. If the film provides no easy comfort for the viewers (or indeed its own participants), that's because there's none to be had. It fully deserves all the plaudits it has received."
69,Waltz with Bashir,10,11 February 2011,A Mesmerizing Feverish Dream that Delivers Us to a Shattering Reality,"The curious animation technique - an oddly flattened, stilted but graceful computer assisted rotoscoping - casts a powerful spell throughout its 90 minutes of inspired hallucinations. It sets you up for a sudden sucker punch of shocking scenes of horrendous reality. Ari Folman isn't pulling a stunt, nor is he exploiting an unconscionable atrocity merely for a cheap cinematic thrill. On the contrary, he's exploiting a very effective technique to honestly, accurately share with us the overwhelming horror of his fractured memories of a wartime nightmare. So that we may more fully experience his intense revelation, he has constructed a deceptively alluring parallel world of moving forms and colors that entrances our eyes as the plainly spoken story penetrates to a very deep and vulnerable part of our psyches. It's a sublimely crafty trick, a profoundly elegant solution to the challenge of recreating in the audience his own experience of finally arriving at a long suppressed, possibly self destroying awareness.The mystery of whether or not he took part first hand in a massacre of Palestinian refugees at a camp in Lebanon in 1982 drives the action, or rather, the animation to some awfully amazing places stylistically. There are vistas and views that mimic reality impeccably but suddenly dissolve and mutate into surreal visions of delirium and paranoia that live action could never equal. What's even more remarkable is that this powerful graphic method, in the end, is more so a necessary concession to an even more powerful effect encountered at the film's end. It suddenly became clear that the use of animation is only a means by which we could be prepared - set up - for the final moment. Ari hasn't created a cartoon just because he prefers making cartoons, but because he trusted animation to lure us, ever so slightly, away from ""reality"". It just so happens that the curious computer aided technique he's developed convincingly, terrifically sustains itself. I never once felt as though use of animation - a form normally employed for more trivial, lighter purposes - was inadequate or disrespectful of the deadly serious subject. The graphic style is absolutely hypnotic, but never distracting, never self indulgent. The film carries itself - and me - effortlessly, magically, gracefully, right up to its powerfully tragic finale.I know well enough that the world is too often a horrible, insane place of misery and despair, and this knowledge has left me numbed, deadened to so much. So, for a modest personal tale to arouse this much convoluted, indescribable emotion in me is a very rare occurrence. That's the power and function of art and is the reason that enlightened societies so highly value true artists, and Ari Folman's ""Waltz With Bashir"" is art of the highest order."
70,Waltz with Bashir,9,13 November 2010,A must see anti-war film,"In recent years Israeli cinema has been on the raise with more films being seen by an international audience and being praised by critics. Waltz with Bashir is seen as a highlight of this emergent, a powerful animated film and it was a big surprise that it was not nominated for Best Film or Best Animated Film at the Academy Awards.Waltz with Bashir tells the story of the director Ari Folman (playing himself), a filmmaker who when his one of his old friends tells of a recurring nightmare he has. When speaking to his friend Ari realises that he has no memory of when he served in the Lebanon War, particularly the Sabra and Shatila massacre. As he starts to have a flashback of the event, Ari sets out to speak to his old friends in the army about they war stories and memories so that Ari can recover his.Animation is not the usual format for documentary but Folman makes it work. The animation style is simple but very effective, with characters looking real, not cartoony. Folman is able to use animation to actually show the events these witnesses describe, whether it's the horrors of war, with young men being scared, shooting at random, being shot at and innocent people getting hurt to the more mundane things like soldiers relaxing on the beach and waiting for orders. With it's bleak view of war many of the characters speak with guilt and realism, many of them ordinary young men in their late teens who were conscripted into the army: the enemy was often in the distance, so we don't get to know anything about them, just that they are fighting them. Folman brings in moments of dark, tragic comedy, like when the Israeli forces try and hit a car with a gunman and end up shooting an innocent man with his donkey and blowing up a whole section of a town. The senior officers are shown to be uncaring men, who just sit back at a distance, unconcerned about events and looked the other way when it suited them.The visual style was incredible, with Folman handling the action, the period, the settings and the transitions from time and locations. The transitions were done with real effect, like when Ari was in the taxi and had his first flashback and to an aerial shot in Holland where the trees change from north Europe trees to Middle Eastern ones. The pacing was just about right, slowly building up the plot and the drive of Ari as he discovers when happened to the fast action of war. Because of the animation, Folman was allowed to get away with showing a lot more then a live action film could with the horrors of war. Waltz with Bashir is a powerful film, a criticism of war, the effects it has on men, during and after the conflict and how brutal war is. Men do not how to act, with some being scared, to some who enjoy the violence. Things can change in an instant, from casually driving to one shot turning everything turning to end. This is an anti-war period, with neither side being made out to be good guys and willing to commit horrible actions. The Israelis just stood by and watched the massacre and the commanding officers just let it, not caring about civilians.On a final note, I have to praise the score by Max Richter, using both an excellent techno beat in the beginning and a sombre piano tune for more violence, intense scenes. Plus some of the sequence could easily work as a short films.Art-house cinema at it's best."
71,Waltz with Bashir,8,21 September 2009,A Nutshell Review: Waltz With Bashir,"The trouble with memory, is more often than not, over an extended period of time, it tends to be faulty. We recall certain key scenes suspended momentarily in time, but with nary a clue how they move forward or backward, akin to knowing presence of the dots, but lacking the details to connect them up. Traumatic experiences may cause chunks to be buried deep and repressed into the subconscious, leaving behind gaping holes susceptible to imaginary inputs that we might assume to have happened.Based on the true story of filmmaker Ari Folman, his friend's recurring nightmare of being haunted by exactly 26 hounds, triggered his realization that he cannot remember a thing about his tour of duty as a 19 year old in the 1982 Lebanon war, except for a mysterious bit of memory that has him, and a group of unknowns, emerge from the beach, walking toward some a war-torn city under the illuminated night skies.Waltz with Bashir is a stunning animated documentary, possibly the first docu that I've seen that's being told in animated form. Ari's story goes about probing and getting more details about his stint, with no memories of his own, and being totally reliant on what others feed him from their perspective. From talking heads styled interviews, events get constructed in piece meal fashion, which provided the Roshomon Effect in technique even, since perspectives are always biased, and again open to inaccuracies.From the memories of his peers, we see countless of imagery of the war fought, each providing a key eventful piece that suggests Ari himself was present when they took place, from simple ambushes, to what slowly unravelled itself to be the Sabra and Shatila Massacre, controversial for the IDF's inaction to prevent a genocide from happening from under its watch in a refugee camp.The imagery used in the film, especially the fantasy, escapist sequences, allowed for some distraction away from the stark visuals on the horrors of war, and you'd have a stone cold heart should you not be affected by the senselessness of evil that Man is capable of. What I liked about the animation here is its lighting and keen use of shadows to suggest something bleak, hidden, and sinister. There's also a unique and beautiful style of animation used her that's invented by the ""Bridgit Folman Film Gang"" studio that combines Flash animation, classic animation and 3D, so those eager to experience something that's new, should make it a point not to miss this.Winner of the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film 2008, the film also clearly serves a sharp critique against war. For an animated piece, it's hard hitting, challenging, and provocative even in questioning how we tend to be apathetic and do nothing when cruelties unfold right in front of us."
72,Waltz with Bashir,8,17 February 2009,War Should not happen,"Ari Folman's Waltz with Bashir movie takes the Animation style into a surrealism form, the real footage at the end represents the real life suffering of the Palestinian people as a whole. The assassination of Bashir Gemayel, leader of the Christian Phalangists caused them to go on to Sabra and Shatila to kill the Palestinians. According to history the Israelis did not commit the crimes but did nothing to stop the Phalangists from doing it. The movie involves Ari Folman going to a bar where he starts talking to a friend that shared time with him during the 1982 Lebanon War. He finds out that he does not remember his past, he admits that he experiences nightmares and flashback of horrible events but Ari is unable to differentiate reality, he also goes back to look for people that were with him during the Lebanon War. As the story develops Folman is telling us that wars only creates suffering, pain, and death. On the other hand, I respect the work of David Polonsky, the Art Director, Yoni Goodman, the Director of Animation for their amazing work in putting the surreal story in an animation style/form. The outcome of Folman's movie is magnificent."
73,Waltz with Bashir,5,1 November 2010,Animation Distances and Impersonalizes the Violence,"Many critics have lauded the use of somber animation to examine the reaction of director Ari Folman and other Israeli soldiers during the first Lebanon War, focusing in particular on the massacres perpetrated against the Palestinans by the Christian Phalangists at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps following the assassination of the charismatic leader of the Phalangists, Bashir Gemayel. This important story might not have worked as a conventional documentary. The film record of the war is slim. It probably would not have worked as fiction either.Folman's approach is certainly ingenious -- an animated ""documentary,"" concluding with actual pictures of the dead Palestinians, exploring the memories and reactions of individual soldiers and attempting to assess the degree of responsibility of Israeli forces for observing but failing to stop the massacres as they might have done if ordered to do so. The film lays the blame for inaction squarely at the feet of Arik Sharon, then the Israeli defense minister.It's an explosive topic to this day in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as well as in Lebanon and among the Palestinians. As I've said, I don't know how else it might have been done, but I frankly found myself distanced from the violence by the animation to the point of disengagement. To be sure, it's not Disney animation or Pixar -- almost the polar opposite. But one can think of dozens of war movies and documentaries that brought the deadly violence directly to the viewer and that successfully captured the emotional toll on individual soldiers.""Waltz with Bashir"" is certainly deserving of an A for effort and imagination but I turned it off in my mind long before it reached its grisly end. Sorry."
74,Waltz with Bashir,7,1 February 2009,Curious film that I admit I felt a little iffy about,"A unique film, a blend of documentary and animation. It definitely shares some aspects with Richard Linklater's Waking Life, but it seems fresh and new. Ari Folman interviews people with whom he served in the Lebanon War in 1983. He himself was a soldier at the time, but he seems to have blocked the entire period from his memory. The film is almost all animated, mostly because it wants to illustrate the events described by his interviewees. He also wants these horrible events which he doesn't remember experiencing to come across as dreams or nightmares. The style of animation is very odd, very simple, and very beautiful. It's an entertaining and mystical film, but it didn't win me over completely. I kept thinking, ""Wow, this is beautiful,"" or ""Wow, this looks neat,"" and then I'd feel guilty for that. The dreamlike quality of the film becomes kind of numbing after a while. Folman switches to live action, real-life footage of the atrocities he doesn't remember witnessing to show that it definitely wasn't a dream, but I felt like it was too little too late."
75,Waltz with Bashir,8,21 November 2008,A memorable and confronting biographical drama that is always interesting to watch.,"This year has been one of an abundance of animated features, good and bad, memorable and not so memorable. If there is one thing that can taken from the output as a whole however it's that the medium seems to be growing up, regardless of its general demographic. Waltz with Bashir, a certified 18 production is key to this movement; the visuals are striking and poignant, taking time to use the style as a way that delivers on the themes of the movie whilst retaining an engrossing aesthetic. This isn't a children's feature by any means but with themes of war and genocide it would be hard to assume otherwise, despite the stigma associated with hand-drawn productions. Instead director and writer Ari Folman uses the medium as a way to support his story without being distracting in any way. In this sense the movie immediately draws comparative features to recent adult-animations such as A Scanner Darkly and this year's Persepolis and yet manages to transcend both thanks to a much firmer script that invokes thought, provides insight into a much neglected subject in western history and reaches out, delivering the themes that Folman wishes to discuss. Through this strong sense of storytelling, the hard hitting visuals and Max Richter's score, Waltz with Bashir delivers what is quite possibly one of the finest examples of adult animation, which is a subgenre undoubtedly is still in its infancy. It's a sign of great things to come, and an effort sure to prove that the medium can be taken seriously and used to greater effect that live-footage may be able to accomplish.Taking a rather surreal documentation approach to his narrative, Folman presents his story through the eyes of himself as he tries to uncover his lost memory involving the Lebanon War twenty years past. Through this direct approach to telling a story, the movie immediately achieves a sense of realism, and when used in combination with the other worldly animation that touches on the rotoscope style featured in Scanner Darkly, strikes a poignant balance between dream-like reminiscence and in-the-moment revelation. In this sense Folman manages to bridge the gap between flashback and real-time storytelling with an ease that too often gets bumpy in other features. Taking his time to talk to several people involved in the war along side himself, Folman presents his character as conducting interviews with those he chats to. Their names will appear in the corner of the screen, and the ""photography"" styles used often echo those found in documentaries. In essence then, what unfolds is virtually an animated documentary of sorts, telling the story of how Folman in real life eventually started to remember his years as a soldier.Although this straight forward approach to indulging in a history lesson involving the Lebanon War provides ample interest, it is when Folman uses the animation present in his film to full effect; travelling back into the his memories of the war itself and presenting first hand accounts. Through these scenes the movie goes to great lengths to provide both hard hitting documents on life during the war as a soldier, and surreal images which deal more with the psychological implications of war. It is during these sequences that Waltz with Bashir achieves its greatest sense of relevancy, merging all three elements of its presentation with grace, significance and well conceived direction. As a war movie, the film and Folman seem to refuse to take a stance on the general concept of war, instead showing what life was like during such times with little to no bias either way; like the masterpiece Apocalypse Now, Waltz with Bashir isn't interested in the politics involved, but more with the humanity that makes war breathe, shoot and cower in fear. It's a story that lacks a position but is far greater off because of it; war is war and Folman knows this all too well, he just has his own personal story to tell that is, once he remembers it.For someone suffering from selective amnesia however, Folman tells a solid tale. Taken as a whole, Waltz with Bashir is a slow moving, but well delivered and insightful piece of cinema that not only sheds light on ourselves and a historical event often shadowed by larger accounts, but it allows the medium to breathe. There are some problems included here, but only in minor details, most of which reside in the somewhat oddly placed third act that seems a little forced and tacked on. Nevertheless there is no denying that what Folman has to say here is not only important and relevant to us many years on, but that it forms a story that moves and feels alive. There are moments of tension, comedy and insightful characterisation that go beyond even the most overt of films that force such elements upon you. Instead Waltz with Bashir is a gradually enveloping affair that slowly reveals itself as the runtime rolls in. Taking full advantage of the animated medium and combining it with a beautiful score and a coherent, intelligent and enlightening script, Folman delivers a memorable and confronting biographical drama that is always interesting to watch, even if it all does feel like a nightmarish dream.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"
76,Waltz with Bashir,10,24 December 2014,Just Excellent,"The psychological conflict of the war brilliantly explained I must say this animation is very similar to the story of a book. Achieve illustrate all without taste of war, human stupidity, feelings and small flashes of humanity that can go into a war.Walts with Bashir could be described as a well-narrated film without vices or propaganda.Quickly, the story grabs you and you live the torments of characters in each of the situations presented.This is a film that should be present in the election of a film lover.For me completely exceeded my expectations, so I evaluated with 10"
77,Waltz with Bashir,9,20 July 2014,An amazing animated film and a personal favorite,"Waltz with Bashir is animated like nothing I have ever seen before. Friends have compared it to a grittier Avatar: The Last Airbender. This gritty stylized animation does wonders for the film, it always looks it's best when combat or some form of action is happening. In turn allowing the film to help convey the animosity of combat along with it's many other messages. The scoring of this film also does wonders for it, such as the juxtaposition of a soft piano medley over an intense gun fight. This film has it's moments that will blow you away and thanks to all the artistic trait of this film they are delivered perfectly. My only warning for this film is that it starts a bit slow, but it ramps itself amazingly in the second half in artistic value, character development, and plot. I recommend this to anyone who even only vaguely would like to see it."
78,Waltz with Bashir,10,22 July 2010,the poetry of horror,"I really, really love this kind of animated films. ""Waltz with Bashir"", along with ""The Grave of the Fireflies"" is probably one of the best expressions of the horrors of war, that it wonderfully manages to combine the violence and the cruelty with sequences of such beauty that makes us think of how even in the most bleak situations, there can be few glimpses of happiness, fun and joy, reaching an almost whimsical, poetic tone in some parts of it. Yet, those beautiful images aren't made to make us to forget the horror and the misery that we watch: The dreams and the poetry live at the same time with the violence, the injustice, and the oblivion. One character tries to reach in his memory many answers for the present, and what he found is something quite different that we could expect in this kind of films. Memory could be tricky sometimes. We choose what we want to remember, but the reality is still there, and past can be changed. But the past is part of what we are, no matter how bad or horrible it is, and no matter how much we make efforts to forget it. This was my very own opinion about this film. Not many times I was lucky enough to see films like this, but the whole experience of this movie was widely rewarding and fulfilling.""Walts with Bashir"" it is a masterpiece. No more, no less."
79,Waltz with Bashir,10,26 March 2010,Israeli director Ari Folman making good use of animation cinema to tell a horrific tale of violence.,"Animation in cinema has come a long way since American film ""Who framed Roger Rabbit"" was directed by Robert Zemeckis in 1988.A lot of things have changed both in real as well as reel life.This is something all directors have taken into consideration while making their films.In his first animation film Israeli director Ari Folman has chosen to keep a neutral stance.Although his film ""Vals Im Bachir"" talks about brutal, senseless killing of people during Israel's military intervention in Lebenon,judging by characters' facial expressions,one can surely feel that there is hardly any feeling of remorse.This has happened as everything is told in a plain,matter of fact style.One of the reasons why people have liked this film is that animation cinema reduces the trauma in a viewer's mind about a massacre.For a director,it is also economically viable to shoot a film with war scenes on animation format as traditional 35 mm cinema mode would cost a lot of money.Waltz with Bashir jolts and shocks viewers as something like this has not been made in recent times.The success of this film has paved the way for more serious topics being covered using animation in near future."
80,Waltz with Bashir,8,26 February 2010,"I can't say what it showed was entirely  true, but how it showed it was good.","The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it immensely. All art is useless.Oscar Wilde's immortal analysis of art can find no better illustration than the movie who' review I have set out to write. Even as I write this I see myself surrounded by bigots and Hypocrites , all of them claiming to be the the most noble souls who ever walked upon this planet.The movie for me was a brilliant exhibition of skillful and delightful animation. The narration was splendid and the way the technical effects have been merged with real life situations is commendable. Technically one of the better movies I have seen of late. I saw this movie last year and watched it on T.V. at around 2 in the night (or morning) .As a filmmaker who is out to create art purely for the sake of art I would give the man all the ratings he wishes for and deserves.As far as the non-technical and factual part of the movie is concerned I am a little disappointed. Just a little , mind you.The movie's tone is surprisingly not blunt. All the facets of the conflict it tries to portray have been screenplayed from the Israeli point of view. Inspite of this we have here a storyline where the "" Who Did It? Who started it?"" are ably downplayed. I mean, the movie could have had a very violent and blunt outlook. Thus avoiding the blame game trap, the plot rarely strays into the whole accountability thing.The themes of disillusionment of the soldier who returns home and the social angle have already been depicted in many movies. This however is the first animated movie which takes an amelodramatic view of the things.I am not well acquainted with the ground realities of the Israel-Palestinian conflict , hence for me to jump down and take sides would be ridiculous as also a cruel joke upon all those who have lost their precious lives and livelihoods in this ghastly affair."
81,Waltz with Bashir,9,13 February 2010,waltz with bashir,"I saw this movie last year after seeing it getting an Oscar nomination and I have to say this movie is amazing , the director who also is the leading character explains the movie in a very strange and unique way . even though this movie is Israeli , there is nothing biased about it on the contrary they show towards the end (spoiler) that Ariel Sharon is the real culprit who happens to be a somewhat war hero for Israelis. The animation is amazing so is the artwork , the soundtrack too is good ,this movie should have won the best foreign film award.If you want to see something different and new go see waltz with Bashir you'll enjoy it."
82,Waltz with Bashir,8,9 August 2009,brilliant but.........,"this film is an awesome foreign film. i'm really into world cinema and what they have to offer. this film is beautifully made. the animation is fresh and startling and just the film in general is very good. there's a couple of things i didn't really like about it though and they are....... 1. even though the film is very short it got a little boring, not much but there was a lot of empty scenes......... 2. i love foreign films and i never usually think they should be tampered with English dubbing but i feel this film really needs it because the animation is wonderful but you have to keep taking your eyes of it to read the subtitles, i feel like i need a good shower after saying that remark but i do feel the film could be enjoyed more if it was dubbed.i think this film should of won best foreign language film at the Oscars because it is a landmark achievement and full of originality. hands down to ari folman for making this and trying to retrace his own steps of his life and putting it into film. if you don't know this already its the true story of ari folman (the director) and what happened to him through the lebanon war........ 8/10.......j.d seaton"
83,Waltz with Bashir,10,28 June 2009,A Masterpiece,"This film is a true work of art. Some people on IMDb have complained about the animation. This is an argument which I find odd. The film is about how the memory altering what really happened. Therefore Forman went for a dream like animation at some points. The soldier floating on the naked woman still seems like a mixture of cam and safety as a boat gets blown up.The animation may appear ""clunky"" to some, but its poetic. Forman's vision of the descending flares as he gets and two colleagues get out of the water is simply stunning. The dream like slowness of it, the sheer smoothness of it (suprising considering the clunky remarks) and the wonder of it all are simply incredible.The stories themselves are a mixture of the absurd, bizarre and shocking. The story of the soldier who was the only member of his tank to survive being treated like he betrayed his the unit, which left him for dead is a strange, tense and moving anecdote. The film is filled with such stories. Occasionally Forman goes for visual symbolism over the impact of the story but it doesn't lessen the film's power.It doesn't make judgements on Israel or Palestine, it does on the Phalangist Christians. It could be seen as neutral to Palestine while expressing the guilt some Israelis felt. But the stance is not what is important about the film. It is the psychological aspect of war that is studied and it tells it in stunning depth and power."
84,Waltz with Bashir,10,25 June 2009,Can't films be therapeutic?,"23 Awards, including a Cesar and a Golden Globe; and 23 more nominations including Oscar and BAFTA. This is one of the very best films of 2008, and would have had more exposure if they had 10 Best Film nominations at the Academy Awards last year.The film was visually stunning. The sound, the music, the animation were all excellent. It was a pleasure to watch and hear.The film is an attempt to understand and explain a massacre that took place during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. A friend of the director interviews old army buddies to try and come up with answers - much like Rashomon.The answers came slowly. Those in command were aware of the massacre and did nothing.We ask ourselves, as we are aware of massacres occurring today in Rwanda, Darfur, even the Holocaust. We knew and we did nothing. Are we just as guilty.The use of animation to tell this story was most appropriate as it allowed the memories to be shown."
85,Waltz with Bashir,10,1 June 2009,A Great Film for an Open Mind,"What is guilt, and should we feel it? By that I mean, is it ever immoral not to? Do we ever deserve guilt, and by refusing to feel it are we evading a fair punishment? In my opinion, the most defining element of ""Waltz With Bashir"" is what is absent from the movie. The parties most ""guilty"", the Christians who actually committed the massacre and the Israelis at the top who allowed them to, are scarcely seen. The audience watches the events only from the point of view of the soldiers who stood idly, suspicious but mostly unaware of the slaughter taking place nearby.Sometimes I find myself lackadaisically pondering the end of cinema when every filmable idea has descended into cliché. Movies like ""Waltz With Bashir"" give me new hope. I don't think I'm ever again going to see a flashback of a sea sick soldier lifted away by a giant, naked woman and carried out to sea as his ship explodes in the background. Like ""Rashômon"", a classic Japanese film, the structure consists mostly of subjective flashbacks told from the unique perspectives of multiple narrators. Writer-director Ari Folman puts an ""Eternal Sunshine"" like twist on this formula. The flashbacks take the shape of real memories, with all their imperfections and exaggerations.I have never seen a movie with this style of animation. I was annoyed at first but as the movie went on I felt more comfortable and actually grew to like it mainly because the visuals tied into the structure of the film. Memories of the Israeli soldiers make up most of the movie, and memories are incomplete. When we remember we recall the basics and the details but not the specifics, like someone's exact facial expression. The animation successfully created a vague, dreamlike atmosphere and added to the film.Several sequences, mostly early on, caught my attention and drew me into the story. I loved the recurring (somewhat false) memory of the protagonist lying on his back naked in the ocean. He emerges with a few friends, dresses, and finds a crowd of women in the city. Propelled by a dark and mysterious film score, the scene manages to be intriguing, enjoyable, and enveloping. The plight of one tank driver, the only survivor of a roadside ambush, into the ocean was captured brilliantly by the film, and the prolonged sequence of him returning back again was beautiful and strangely menacing.I saw much of the movie as an exploration of guilt. The key issue is the massacre itself. The protagonist cannot remember it at all, perhaps because of his own lingering feelings of guilt. The film focuses on the Israeli soldiers, and the entire picture of the massacre is painted from their memories. The film indicates that they have little to feel guilty about. The ground troops were ""just following orders""; none of them knew enough to understand exactly what was going on, and plenty of soldiers actually made an effort to report any wrongdoing they witnessed. I think that the filmmakers made the right choice by only focusing on the Israelis. The various anecdotes from the point of view of these soldiers work together to create a coherent impression of the events, avoiding pretension.By the end of the film we get the impression that the protagonist has seen enough, that he has at last confronted and accepted his limited role in the massacre. His storyline reaches a resolution. But as real documentary footage replaced an hour and half of animation, I realized that Ari Folman has achieved something much more important than that.Part of me can't help but feel that most Hollywood productions centering on the worst moments in human history, like the Holocaust or the Rwandan Genocide, are doing at least a mild disservice the real event. The most egregious is ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", where, amidst millions of deaths in the Holocaust the movie contrives an absurd ""tragic"" ending that leaves the audience feeling sorry for a dead boy and his mourning Nazi father. Even good films, like ""Hotel Rwanda"" leave a bitter aftertaste in this regard; notice the PG-13 rating.""Waltz With Bashir"" redefined, for me at least, the limits of what can be captured in a single film. The variety of narrators slowly painted a detailed image of the war (I confess that I am not very familiar with the actual incident) out of brief memories of moments of intense feeling. The end result is far more convincing than a straightforward narrative or even series of flashbacks. The exaggerations, bloodshed, and song-and-dance sequences are engrossing and exist on an emotional level rarely explored in film.After so much wild animation, the documentary footage at the end caught me off-guard. The barrier was broken. ""Unforgettable"" wouldn't begin to describe the sight of the mourning widows, demolished buildings, and piles of dead bodies stuffed into allies. I had seen the remains of the massacre few minutes before, when the film was still animated, but I didn't feel the massacre until I saw it for real. The movie had spent its entire running time preparing the audience for this one final scene (the present-tense narrators are never revisited), and I was ready, in some way, to understand the grieving and the bloodshed from the perspective of the soldiers who saw the immediate aftermath. ""Waltz With Bashir"" is a masterpiece in that it doesn't use a horrific incident to depress the public into giving it a bunch of awards, but instead actually lets the audience understand the massacre from one point of view. Hundreds of men, women, and children were rounded up and executed. No easy getaway, no Hollywood ending, no dramatic tragedy, no perseverance against all the odds. Just a truth that deserves to be remembered."
86,Waltz with Bashir,10,24 May 2009,Beautiful,"Waltz with Bashir is possibly one of the most ;Beautiful, Original, Disturbing films i've ever seen. It borderline is just Very nice to look at... every scene is a painting and in every Painting Ari Folman crafted and soothed his way to becoming the film it was meant to be.. A masterpiece... there's nothing short of saying that it really is perfect. The Visuals, The script... Even though in Hebrew the film can get its message out clearer than Lighting out of a Clear Sky... Some of the scenes just give you a tingling sensation in your chest...and You will want to see it again there no question about it...You will need to know How beautiful that scene is...What message he's trying to put through to the viewer..."
87,Waltz with Bashir,8,27 April 2009,The Center cannot Hold,"Roger Ebert writes in his review of Coraline how he wishes someone would create an animated adult film that is in no way intended for children, one for adults that presents controversial material. I share his sentiment and wish to see adult animation that isn't exploitative or mindless. Even some anime I enjoy has no analytic value. Selick's three stop motion films, while directed for juvenile audiences, are intelligent enough to entertain adults. People may not like any of them, but there is a noticeable difference between his movies and Kung Fu Panda-cuteness pics (kiddie version of droll exploitative animation). We in the United States have not fully explored the capabilities of animation. We delegate it as children's entertainment or satirical farce. South Park is amusing as cultural critique but imminently forgettable. Ari Folman has somewhat fulfilled Ebert's plea with Waltz with Bashir.Folman served in Israel's infantry during the 1982 Lebanon War. He was 19, my age, during his service. In 2006, Folman realized he had no memory of what he observed during the war. This movie is a recreation of his journey of self-discovery. Folman meets with other veterans to discuss their experiences living in war, many of who posses vivid memories of what happened. The film culminates with Folman's memory of the Sabra and Shatila Massacre, in which Israeli troops allowed Christian Lebanese militia to gun down Palestinian refugees. The movie strives for the noble goal of portraying the war's effect (not its progression) on Folman. It seems as if he's always perturbed; be it day one or day x. He is shooting invisible enemies, it seems. He doesn't protest or pity himself. He simply tries to continue to exist. We never hear commentary about Israel's political aspirations in the war.The movie is an autobiographical documentary, not propaganda in any way. The view is told from an Israeli perspective, however. It is not difficult envisioning a Sabra or Shatila survivor ""remaking"" Waltz with Bashir in coordination with this one. The vicissitudes of war are such than any version of this story would probably as effective as this one. I, personally, would have appreciated some dialog from those fighting against Israel or from someone involved in Israeli government (at the time). We are able to empathize with Folman in a generic gosh-that-looks-bad sort of a way, though we should have more emotion than that. In one evocative portion, Folman observes a comrade kill a child suicide bomber. The narrative then continues. Folman says nothing, like anyone would. Why include something like this without signifying it. Many other people die in this film. A child's death should get more attention, methinks.Folman drew over flash images for this film. Hayao Miyazaki did something similar in Princess Mononoke but with digital pre-rendered images. The cartoon program Ed, Edd, and Eddy looks similar to this film, yet Waltz with Bashir is more refined. The film truly has a unique look, one that never permits an audience to feel at ease. During the many war scenes, images are of diluted yellowish color, like the pages of an old book. Black outlines surround characters and objects. The contrast is striking. You may forget the specific content of this movie after your viewing but the color scheme won't fade. The nonviolent parts are colored white or gray, as if they aren't important.Waltz with Bashir is an indulgent move by Folman. Even so, it is informative without being confessional. I have no way of ascertaining if Folman actually lost his memory or not. It works well as a plot device and prevents the film from being slanted. Animation allows us to experience the war in the most engrossing way possible. When one looks at an actor portraying a military officer, he/she may be inclined to see the person and not the character. You can't do that in most animated movies. Now, Folman immerses us into that dark time where Israeli people nearly became the perpetrators of their own unfortunate history.**** out of *****"
88,Waltz with Bashir,8,24 April 2009,One of the Best Modern War Movies,"Ari Folman's Waltz With Bashir was one of the best movies I saw in 2008. I went in with some reluctance, not sure what I was going to get. An animated movie about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict directed by an Israeli? I expected a rather biased movie with some awkward animation.What a surprise it was! This may be one of the most intelligent, sensitive and tolerant portrayals of war I've ever seen in a movie, up there with Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and The Deer Hunter. It's a movie that explores all angles: the fear of being in the middle of a war; the alienation one experiences when one returns home; the thoughts the enemies may have and their own motives. All is wonderfully explores in this movie, although Folman gives special relevance to the trauma Israeli soldiers suffer when they return from the war, the way some block out memories to forget the horrors they saw and committed, and the nightmares that haunt them.Using animation to discuss such an important matter is a bold choice; after all, it may seem Folman is trivializing the war. But it's the only type of film-making that allows him to delve into the psyches of his characters and extract their surreal dreams and remembrances. Folman paints memories here with tinges of surrealism and the animation only helps to reinforce the strangeness, whether it be a man dreaming about a giant woman coming to rescue him; or a man dancing ballet with a machine gun; or a man being chased by mad dogs.One of the best aspects of the movie, although underrated, is Max Richter's score. Folman's visuals are amazing, but everyone knows a great track only enriches a picture. Well, Richter has crafted one of the most beautiful and haunting scores I've ever heard. There's a recurring sequence of three ghoul-like soldiers emerging naked from the ocean and walking into a deserted, burning city. Richter's music is melancholy and powerful here, going straight to the heart, and I don't doubt much of the power of the scenes come from this music, aptly title 'Haunted Ocean'.All in all, this is one of the best animated movies ever made, and Folman deserves to join the ranks of great filmmakers, like Jan Svankmajer and the Brothers Quay, who have made animation something more than a children's genre."
89,Waltz with Bashir,10,21 March 2009,Unlike anything I've ever seen,"Ari Folman's takes us through an amazing experience via this Israelite animated documentary which traces the events during the 1982 Lebanon War, told from the perspective of the directors' own experiences as a soldier during the massacres.The script is cleverly written with an intriguing opening involving a haunting nightmare with 26 vicious dogs, which not only aroused the protagonist of the film to rediscover his vanished memories of the war, but also intrigued the audiences to explore/reminisce the horrific events. His various visits to a string of people who were involved in the war revealed the shocking events, step by step, with each scene more heartfelt and profound than the previous ones.Its animated nature may mistaken some audiences before they step into the cinema, in terms of the topic it dealt with, as those who are slightly oblivious to the plot may merely expect sensory stimulation from a seemingly 'cool' animated feature. However, the result proved to be as shocking and real as it would be if it was a documentary. In fact, a real life recreation would probably not create an analogous impact to Folman's work. The dialogues and violence successfully conveyed the horror and complexity of war through actual and surreal events, not to mention the visual aesthetics and the thoughtful sound editing/background music.With so many war films made in the past and present, some may inevitably fail to create a strong impression. However, Waltz with Bashir is unlike anything I have ever seen, the disturbing elements and messages are interpreted in such a unique way that, it left me heartfelt even after a couple of days.A definite 10/10."
90,Waltz with Bashir,10,18 March 2009,Emotionally devastating,"I was prepared for some very dark animation, but I did not expect the emotional havoc this movie would wreck. Ari Folman, cued by the disturbed dreams of a friend, investigates into his own memory of Lebanon and slowly unveils his own small role in a massacre. As a filmmaker, cinema doesn't quite do his investigations enough justice--compatriots warn him not to film them, some mention their experiences as being ""like a movie"" (and so, when making a movie, how to separate them?)... Instead, he animates it in order to mix the missing memories with the haunted dreams, a representational approach to warfare.Now, such an approach could be considered distancing and romantic, if not over-glorified, especially since the multi-media approach to animation doesn't always synthesize into elements that work as a whole. However, quickly those stylistic arguments disappear and the movie sucks you right into what are a series of confessionals of people who've seen real horror. And then, once Ari's own memory snaps into place, then the movie becomes real.This movie couldn't have come out at a better time. This year's traveling collection ""Fear(s) of the Dark"" features the nightmarish, but not the real, and can easily be shrugged aside as fantasy. Many Oscar contenders and even a couple that got nominations attempted the back-door route of dealing with Nazi Germany. But here, Folman does something that happens very rarely in Holocaust films: shows his own role in it. Takes responsibility for it. Feels horrified for it. And frankly, any director expecting a quick shiny prize for depicting a history they've only heard of should take note that nothing compares to true, real-life horror.--PolarisDiB"
91,Waltz with Bashir,10,8 March 2009,A landmark in film history,"I saw ""Waltz with Bashir"" at a matinée at a multiplex in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, a resort town. I am somewhat film-savvy and was well aware of what it was about and drove nearly an hour to see it. (It was playing in Maryland, but I happened to be in Delaware.) There were only three people in the audience, myself included. The other two were an elderly married couple. After it ended, the couple immediately came up to me. They were very disturbed and wanted to talk to someone, anyone, about what they had just seen. In conversation, it turned out the only reason they came is that they heard it won an Oscar and they wanted to see movies that had just won an Oscar.This middle class American couple had no point of reference to assess the movie and wanted me, a total stranger, to ""explain"" it to them. I make no claim to be the great explainer and I make no pretense to being intellectually superior, but I tried to tell them that this movie was based on real events and made by an Israeli who experienced them. They basically wanted to know what they were expected to think about it. That's when I made a hasty exit.Sadly, Waltz with Bashir seems to be relegated to a specialized audience -- people who care what happened in Lebanon in 1982. Plus, film buffs. It should be seen by everyone with an interest in what goes on outside Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. But the issues the movie raises are incomprehensible to most -- far too many -- Americans.Let there be no doubt -- this is film art of the highest order. As the movie progressed, using what I assume is rotoscoping in combination with full-fledged animation, I realized the filmmaker had chosen these means because no other way of telling his story his way was possible.When the ending turned to newsreel footage, I found myself hoping, praying, that the film would return to rotoscope for some kind of coda. ""He's not going to leave us this way,"" I thought. My eyes were full of tears and my heart was in my mouth.I won't say more.See this movie."
92,Waltz with Bashir,9,7 March 2009,"Well, **** me, I'm officially blown away.","I knew i was watching something special from the moment it began. Those scenes were some evil looking dogs are running down a nightly street with some dark techno music in the background. It has a greet feel to it and looks superb. As it turns out the movie isn't that great looking throughout, its a bit uneven in this respect, but if you like the style enough it wont matter.Reminding quite a bit of Waking Life and in style (though not really, this is actually animated) and last years Persepolis (in how it fills us in with a piece of history we aren't familiar with). The story in itself is pretty simple. Its about a ex-soldier who is troubled by the fact that he doesn't remember much of the war, just some brief but intriguing flamages, and decides to seek up his former war-buddies and shed some light on it all. His journey is also ours.The directing shines throughout. The use of music is exceptional (for instance the scene with ""This Is Not A Love Song"", or the ""Waltz For Bashir shooting scene in the streets, or that certain flashback/dream sequence for that matter). There are plenty of scenes through to both amuse us and perplex us. But through the animation we are still kept at an armslenght from reality. Until the end. This is what truly makes this film, not only a good one, but one of the best of the year. How it ties everything together in the last scene where the camera (in the protagonists head) breaks. Brilliant. Just brilliant."
93,Waltz with Bashir,9,4 March 2009,An Introspective War Classic,"Who would have thought that a documentary about a soldier's personal trip to discovery about himself and his role during the Christian Phalangist's massacre of Palestinians in Sabra and Shatila could best be presented in stark yet cool graphics animation? ""Waltz with Bashir"" does exactly that, surpassing my wildest expectations about what this movie was about. Ari Folman directs his own animated self in his quest to discover what happened to him during a most brutal massacre that he has all but repressed in his unconscious.I have very vague ideas about the events surrounding the assassination of President Bashir Gemayel of Lebanon and the retaliatory violence it sparked against the Palestinians. My lack of knowledge about recent Middle Eastern history made the experience of this film very interesting, especially in the way the screenplay tackled the story. The artwork was very simple in its muted palette of colors, yet there is no denying that it was effective and even realistic. The musical score, which ranged from rock to new wave to classical, was very haunting. And words fail to describe what one feels during the jolting return to reality in the last eight minutes.As with all war movies I have seen, there had basically been one unifying message -- that war is senseless, and damaging to all concerned. ""Waltz with Bashir"" conveys this same massage in a most unique, and very memorably effective way."
94,Waltz with Bashir,8,1 March 2009,Waltz of death,"This may be the best animated movie you've seen, including Disney. Film-maker Ari Folman tells the story about him taking part in the Lebanon war of 1982. And being aware of the falangist massacre on Pelestines, when the Israeli army just waited outside the camps. But there's one problem: He hardly remembers anything.So he visits old comrades, TV-reporters, psychiatrists and after a while the whole scenario is there including the details. It's a nightmare.The animation is perfect. On the surface, the drawings are like those in bad comic magazines, but through that technique you after a while anyway find them exact. It's like watching a live documentary about one of the worst war deeds during the 20th century. It's a punch in the stomach."
95,Waltz with Bashir,10,25 February 2009,"""The flames are all gone, but the pain lingers on... goodbye blue sky""","6to Festival International de Cine Contemporaneo de la Ciudad de Mexico: Waltz with Bashir (Ari Folman, 2008)-Did you see the frightened ones? Did you hear the falling bombs? Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath a clear blue sky? Did you see the frightened ones? Did you hear the falling bombs? The flames are all gone, but the pain lingers on. Goodbye, blue sky, goodbye. -You go to fight, to war but you can't kill men then you are the indicated one to kill dogs, 26 dogs that may died there during the 1982 Lebanon war but that will haunt you, that will stay with you, that will be with you every night when you close your eyes. So I had my second visit to the FICCO and again I saw a documentary and what a film! Waltz with Bashir begins with those mentioned dogs, those dogs that once appeared during the war and that now are just part of the memory certainly, are just part of nightmares. We meet director Ari Folman and one of his friends who as he fought in the 1982 Lebanon war but who unlike him still have that war in his head, in his nightmares. The documentary begins but nothing is very clear but for sure Ari Folman want for himself those memories back, he basically had nothing in his memory from the war in which he fought before he meet with that friend of him, he will not be in peace on that way since he will not stop thinking in the simple question: ""what exactly I lived during the war?"". How the memory works give to Ari only one image of the war, an image of the day of the massacre, he will be with people he meet in that time, he will find what happened, he will be a listener, a member of the audience to see what happened with some people during that mentioned war. Is very unique, basically we see the memories of certain persons and this will show us the horror of war. One of those person that we and Ari hear tells his memories about an attack that they suffered in which he was the only one of his team that could escape from the enemies, he certainly don't know how this and how that happened, how the enemies never saw him hiding, certainly he was almost in a state of unconsciousness, the fear, the sea, and finally his team again. More or less it was a tale of simply how he survived that attack but he can't feel good about that, that because he could escape from the attack he feel guilty, that because he was the only one who could do that he feel like he abandoned his group and that stayed with him through the years. So we have what these persons remember but there is always for Ari the question of what he lived, ""I was there with you?"" and stuff. Waltz with Bashir is not an easy film to watch, we have moments of camaraderie, moments that now may be funny to remember for the soldiers but there's always the feel that in the middle of the battle they forget about everything, no strategy, no nothing, sure they trained for years but that is not really relevant, fear is the only they remember, ""How should I know?"", you will hear that dialog more than a single time. Waltz with Bashir is a piece of work, a brilliant piece of animation and of course is a difficult film, we have surreal things of a real thing, real footage is shown, the dream is gone. This is one of the best 2008 films, a true must-see."
96,Waltz with Bashir,,16 February 2009,Raising Awareness through Film-making,"This was an animated war film that worked well. The film deals with how people deal with psychological trauma and memory, as well as the theme of inaction and complacency  both, which are relevant to our present state of international affairs.With the final scene the director chooses to show raw footage of the atrocities that were committed. Personally, I felt this film was a way for the director to raise awareness but also a call for the audience to take action. One of the main themes was that the protagonist felt guilt for his inaction which brings up the question  is standing to the side and not pulling the trigger the same as killing and contributing to the deaths of innocent people? At what point will people be compelled to take action  until it affects them personally where they can no longer suppress their memories and coping mechanism? Until it is too late and they are at the opposite end of the gun? This film utilizes its form of animation to show what could be difficult to capture in real life such as the scene in which a soldier Waltz with a gun. The director does this well and exploits this medium in a way that maintains our suspension of disbelief."
97,Waltz with Bashir,8,16 February 2009,A Very Stylistic Approach to Telling A War Story,"I've never seen such a formalistic approach to a soldier's war film as in 'Waltz With Bashir' by director Ari Folman. He uses his own self as the main character for this film, which I feel adds to the convincing narrative tale of his experiences. About 95% of the movie is shot as a computer-animated cartoon while the remaining 5% is an actual documentary. This method of portraying his war experiences in Lebanon as stated previously, have never been seen before and I feel may revolutionize the way in which war stories are depicted through film. Watching how the vividly portrayed characters interacted, actually brought me back to the periods of time when I was in Iraq. The overall storyline was somewhat hard to follow, but I feel the director did this on purpose to show us how it was like to try and recall his memories of fighting overseas. His method of showing the greater part of the film as a cartoon and the ending section in a documentary, forms an underlying message that states the reality of things. The events of the war that he recalls in his mind are playing as a cartoon whenever he reminisces, but ultimately in the end, the situations are definitely real and concrete."
98,Waltz with Bashir,9,16 February 2009,Waltz with Bashir is an animated film that follows the director Ari Folman's journey to remember the events that occurred when he was an Israeli soldier invading Lebanon.,"Waltz with Bashir is an innovative film that is definitely worth watching. The animation style is like nothing I have ever seen before, and I predict many movies over the next few years will emulate this animation style. The movie follows the director, Ari Folman, on his journey to remember the events that occurred while he was an Israeli soldier invading Lebanon. The two themes that stick out for me while watching this film, is the power of the mind and the results of war. Ari has no memory of the events that occurred in Lebanon. I believe this is his minds way of protecting him from the pain that he witnessed and may have bestowed upon others during battle. The power of the mind is a great mystery and I found it fascinating the amount of work it took for Ari to retrieve his memories. As a civilian I as many others tend to see war like a sporting event, there is a clear winner and loser. Waltz with Bashir makes it apparent that in war there is really only losers. The reason for war at many times is the greed of a few that is fought by pawns who have no knowledge of why they are even fighting. This movie mad me sad for the soldiers on both sides, and our troops in Iraq. Waltz with Bashir is a must see, especially if you have a loved one who has returned form Iraq. This film gives you a glimpse into what mentally happens when a young soldier returns from the brutal realities of war."
99,Waltz with Bashir,8,16 February 2009,Waltz with Bashir,"Waltz with Bashir, released in 2008 by Director Ari Foleman, is a formalistic masterpiece, unraveling around the Ari's search for truth surrounding his own involvement with the Israeli Army mission during the first Lebanon War in the early eighties. Unable to remember anything around that time, Ari sets out to interview friends who were also involved in the war. The approach to this film is surprisingly unique in its conception of tacking something as realistic as war and delivering it a medium as formalistic as animation. However unique it may be, the choice to do so allows for us as an audience to explore at a safe distance that sad reality and atrociousness that is war. Foleman uses non-linear narrative to show us the present of where the men are now, and flashes back to unveil their stories at the time of war. Through his use of the animated medium he is able to capture the lonely, crazy and murderous aspects of his colleagues did during the war. At times using animation to represent real moments in time, and other times resorting to using animation to represent dreams or pieces of memory that cant fully be represented through a lens of a camera. The tone of the movie is in constant motion adapting different animation techniques to represent different ideas within the story, all while maintaining a rather gloomy, contrast feel throughout. In the end we are exposed real footage that is so powerful do to our initial separation from reality by the animation techniques, that as an audience you feel almost overwhelmed, and nothing but sadness for the those whom lost the ones they love during the war."
100,Waltz with Bashir,8,16 February 2009,Cleverly Marketed For All To See,"If this film was not animated I don't think that I would have seen it, especially being a foreign film about war. The concept of animating it made devastating atrocities of the massacres of innocent Palestinian men woman and children viewable. Director Ari Folman did an exceptional job at pulling it off by keeping you consumed with the imagery while telling his story of wondering if he was involved in the 1982 Lebanon war, the Sabra and Shatila massacres.The Max Richter score complimented the long takes along with the warm color values which made each scene very moody and personal. The tedious job of rotoscoping selected frames my have been the reason Ari chose to include the R-Rated scene which I did not understand. Seems like it was footage from down time of rotoscoping that was just inserted. Waltz With Bashir is slow moving but with punch and originality. I am thankful that Ari trusted the American audience would enjoy and get it."
101,Waltz with Bashir,8,16 February 2009,"""In war, even the winners lose""","War affects people in different ways, the way it affected filmmaker Ari Folman, is the basis for the film ""Vals Im Bashir"" or ""Waltz with Bashir"". Years ago Folman fought with the Israeli army, as almost all young Israeli's do. He did things that most of us would like to forget, and thats exactly what Ari Folman did. This film is incredibly touching, its animation displays ideas that are just simply touching. To see what these people go through, its extreme, here where I live, in the west side of Los Angeles, it is relatively safe, and to see what people go through every day in that part of the world is just mind boggling. This film does more than just document a mans journey to rediscover his lost memories, it delves deep into human nature, and how disgusting it sometimes is. Young men and women, every day are instructed by others (who are miles away) to do inhuman things, thats what this film is about. It's about how people go and ""kill for their country"" and how very often ""the enemy"" consists of unarmed civilians, just trying to wade out the violence, just trying to live their lives, and just as often as not end up as ""collateral damage""The technical skill here is obvious even to the layest of the laymen, the animation is just beautiful, some of it interestingly seems to be drawn over filmed images, giving a realistic but artificial look to much of the film. In fact I think that was the point of the animation, to give it a certain quality of reality, but a perceived reality, which is known in the film world as ""formalism"".In my opinion one of the bravest things one can do is to question. To question their own ideas and actions, and the actions of their people. That is precisely what this film does. It does not directly criticize anyone, it merely brings all of it to the forefront. It asks is it right to just listen to what your told? Or should you sometimes refuse, even if it will have ill effects on you and your life. It brings to mind an old saying ""In war, even the winners lose."" It is some times very difficult to distinguish ""right"" and ""wrong"" and that is the tight rope that this film walks on."
102,Waltz with Bashir,8,16 February 2009,Explorative Documentary Stylized Film,"Waltz with Bashir is an explorative documentary style film that captivates the viewer in a world of trance and exploration. The film is in animation and this allows spectacular scenes of dreams and nightmares. The nightmare scenes are fantastic and sharp with powerful visual imaginary, which will stick in your mind for weeks. The animation work is incredible because of the powerful contrast of nude men, calm water, and reflective buildings. It reminds me of a fireworks show on the ocean pier when the flares light the sky and illuminate the men walking with high contrast ratios. The editing is a bit sharp and can be confusing during the travel sequences, but it helps to get the viewer asking questions like, ""What's going on here?"" Which may be more intriguing than just a strait narrative with a transitional picture of a world map.The filmmakers ability to star in his own movie, which conveys such a hefty topic, suggests his visually creative skills. His views of the 1980's are surreal. When the world spins by he is solely in focus, but the subtext behind his friend's intentions with the ex-girlfriend are disturbing, but are conveyed through his extremely stylized first person perspective. The end of this movie can impact a person for the remainder of there life, so beware.Overall, this movie is simply a work of art, with a true story to tell. As Robert Zemeckis once said, ""A movie should combine spectacle with narrative."" Well, Waltz with Bashir does just that. There are many ways the story could have been told, but the animation allows for a hard topic to be grappled with without rejection. It is similar to the story of the solider in the movie who claims the only way he was able to cope with war was to pretend he was watching it through a TV. Animation allows the audience to participate in this alternate reality with a rule-breaking ending."
103,Waltz with Bashir,8,15 February 2009,Stylized to surprise,"Visually stunning and a very formalistic approach on an otherwise serious subject matter of war. Written and directed by Ari Folman, this is a story about how he tries to piece together his time as he served in the Israeli Army during their war with Lebanon. I believe he chose to animate his movie so as to lighten the blow of the concept of war (not many people can stomach the fact that people die in wars) and also to make it seem as though we are watching his dream; many of the scenes may or may not have happen because he is basing it off of what he can gather from others.His story telling method somewhat follows the, ""I'm going to bore you then bang, here comes the good stuff"" style which is a satisfying way of telling a story such as this. And his move from the formalist aspect to an eye opening realist look sure punches you in the face. It was very moving. This reminded me of my time spent deployed (yes, I was a US soldier and oh the stuff I had seen myself.)The underlying subtext of this film is there and is for each viewer to decide on his/her own. I have to say, war is war, there is nothing pretty about it. That's why I think stylizing this movie the way he did was an ingenious idea of bringing his story to light. In all, I believed this was a very well told story. I understood where he was coming from and his choices he made in this film were admirable."
104,Waltz with Bashir,10,15 February 2009,Waltz With Bashir - A Suppression of Reality for Dreams,"At the end of the film the blunt, jarring edit (a close form cut from animation to actual news footage of the Sabra/Shatila Massacre) is a jolt to the senses. I was often questioning to myself why this was directed as such, and to what message this was evoking in audiences. I felt it could be that the trauma soldiers experience can be so great, their recall of past events (or in Ari Folman's own experiences fighting as an infantryman for the Israel Defense Forces) can be suppressed and distorted in the form of dreams. In the case of this film, the animation could be a form of a dream-like awareness, a detachment from disturbing, horrible events of a past time--a way to endure, and live your life as seen in present time. Folman and his peers' memories of the war may or may not appear as news footage, as it could to the rest of society looking in from the outside. Their memories are entirely different, and it could be in one big animation of surreal images, distorted lines of perspective, just a lifelong long take of artificial images, if they are to revisit such times. It is perhaps the dream-like quality of Waltz With Bashir that audiences enjoy, swimming in the warm, smooth colors of each frame, that we are pulled into the inner psyche and dreams of each soldier's story. As opposed to a film like Rashomon that depicted the telling of a single event from many sources, this movie tended to be more of the emotions and issues of the soldiers, their complications and questions about participating in a massacre whose answers always seem to be out of reach, or sometimes incomprehensible to themselves."
105,Waltz with Bashir,10,15 February 2009,A unique duality of genre and style.,"This animation sends us a message regarding a difficult subject to pose. In these days of a modern world, we are barely even aware of the ongoing conflicts that plague certain regions of the world, and yet in this presentation we are brought very much up to date with the events that have been occupying this particular area for what seems like forever. Thru the eyes of a soldier we learn of some of the atrocities that happen in conflicts such as this, as only a military personnel could recount it. Truth must always be the motivation as we search for answers for better solutions in resolving these conflicts, and the effects that war has on all involved. Without spoiling this experience I would simply say that the innovation with which the creators present this sensitive subject works."
106,Waltz with Bashir,8,15 February 2009,Waltz with Bashir,"The film ""Waltz with Bashir"", written and directed by Ari Folman, is a contemplation of war, its causes, and its aftermath. Through his first hand experiences as a young soldier in the Israeli Defense Forces, Folman draws upon his memories of the grim truth regarding the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon, and his thoughts and feelings towards warfare in general. It's no surprise that a young soldier's memories of war are usually fragmented, cold, and dismal; this is precisely why I believe Ari Folman made the crucial directional choice to animate his story instead of casting specific actors to play specific roles. It is a significance in itself, he cannot put many names to faces, he only remembers the consequences  the results of his actions. The animation and art quality of this film alone deserve much recognition. Through a highly formalistic approach to shading, shot design, and sketch art, the Art Director David Polonsky truly gives each scene an eerie aesthetic of its own, whether seen with or without audio. Through this powerfully animated documentary, Ari Folman exposes the bleak truths of political and military conflict, shares his outlook on the psychological aspects of combat, and leaves the viewer with a strong sense of the ""bulldozer effect""."
107,Waltz with Bashir,8,13 February 2009,I was literally standing in an empty hall-!-!-!,"I watched Vals Im Bashir just yesterday.Me and my friend were going to watch it,even though he didn't want to but he was returning a favor since i went to watch Underworld 3 with him,and we found our self in the empty hall.We were the first to buy a ticket a half an hour before the beginning.Four more people bought a ticket which makes us six in the hall.So i began to wonder my self is it really that bad.I mean Oscar's already nominated some bad movies before so it could be that this one is bad too.And i must say that the movie was a real surprise.It was really good.The story is just great.A man can't remember did he or did he not committed a massacre.All he can remember is looking at the town in which massacre was committed.So he start's to investigate.He find's his comrades from war and he ask's them about the war.By doing so he gather's the information's and discover's the truth about what happened through their memories.I wont say how the movie ended.By that i mean i wont say was he or was he not interfered in that massacre but i will say that there is a short video at the end of the movie that's actually shooted after that massacre.And it's stunning.The only thing that disappointed me about this movie is how it was visually represented.I didn't like it.It would be a lot better if it was made as a movie instead as an animation.However it don't means that it's still not Oscar worthy.It's still great in almost every aspect.And i think that it's pathetic how people judge some movies only because they're made different.That's why i think that the hall was empty.Don't miss it.It's a stunning experience!!!"
108,Waltz with Bashir,7,4 July 2008,"Very Good Movie, But Please Give A Thought To Possible Consequences","It took Mt. Folman four years to remember what happened to him two decades ago, when Israel made an agreement with a Christian Lebanese leader to get rid of the Palestinians, who were harassing both the Israelis and the Lebanese. He choosed animation, which was not easy, but certainly gave him complete freedom of work, and sometimes he overdid it. However, the result would be OK if we were living on a peaceful planet, where everybody loves Israel and what it did to turn a desert into a fertile and prosperous country. Unfortunately, Israel has much more enemies than friends. And the accomplished work brought forward by Mr. Folman has much more chance of winning additional enemies than give a clear picture of events who disturbed him profoundly at their time, and now may disturb a lot more people who do not have a clear view of the situation existing in 1982 (and persisting). There is an old saying, that you should turn your tongue 25 times in your mouth before uttering whatever you have to say - and whichever you put it. If you do not, you are in for more trouble than satisfaction.While the Israelis did not ""murder"" their prisoners, they did not do anything to keep the phalangists out of Sabra and Chatila. The event was largely exposed in the papers, the responsible people were blamed and everybody felt relieved to forget the whole matter. Now, Mr Forman, in order to find peace for his mind, has built this interesting but very dangerous movie. The scarce audience in my theater did not comment in any way, but the movie has been released in not less than 20 cinemas (in Paris alone). It was shown - and praised - at the last Cannes Festival, it deserves it, artistically, but I found it very dangerous, in the present circumstances. harry carasso, Paris, France"
109,Waltz with Bashir,6,3 April 2009,I was confused!,"I must say that I went out of the cinema pretty confused after I saw Valtz Im Bashir. Was it a documentary about war between Israel and Palestine? In that case I could not see enough facts (statistics) and it was too emotional. Was it a story about the war between Israel and Palestine? In that case I could not see the story line, one compact structure. I did not know what “message” the film wanted to give me. Was it only informative about the war? A documentary about a massacre? A sad story of a man who forgets? Or did they want to show me that Jews can be as brutal as Nazis? Technically was the movie in very high quality, I mean the animations were really good, they reminded me more on Japanese films than Persepolis. Honestly said I am a little bit disappointed."
110,Waltz with Bashir,6,10 July 2009,Interesting - but not without flaws - Israeli animated film,"This animated film from Israel, winner of several awards, is about a forty something man who served in 1982's war in Lebanon but who has his mind blocked about what went on to him there and enlist his friends and former comrades in arms to help him try to remember his service. In the final half hour, with its series of interviews with talking heads who were there (including a famous Israeli TV journalist) it becomes sort of a somewhat extended and not terribly original TV documentary. While a good movie, I found another animated film dealing with politics in the Middle East from a personal point of view, Marjanne Satrapi's Persepolis, to be more interesting and rewarding. And what is somewhat bothersome from Bashir, is not so much its leftist point of view, but the constant guilt and self-hate of its protagonist. (Certainly, if people like him were around in 1948, Israel would have never attained independence). Recommended with those reservations."
111,Waltz with Bashir,8,23 May 2014,Animated documentary that is effective,"This a unique movie that is in a somewhat documentary form, but also follows the story of a Israeli infantry soldier that can't really remember or wants to forget the past during his military days because of guilt and thus can't remember. So he goes around asking others that are psychologist and other witnesses of certain events when it comes to the Sabra and Shatila massacre. In order to retrace what went down and recollect his memories. Watching this movie is like seeing the traumatic experience including some guilt that the soldiers go through even years after the military days. Some may say that the animation factor may take away from the effective seriousness of the situation. However I thought it made this film, more immersive and engrossing to the situation at hand. They could have used real actors, but it adds more of that psychedelic and psychological aspect to this film through the animation. Kinda like being in a dream like state, which actually adds more to the perspective of the soldiers. And when it comes to the perspectives of the witnesses that experienced the harsh event. The animation here is well done and effective, kinda reminded me of the animation of the show Archer except more realistic when it comes to the movements. This film is heartfelt and gut-churning, with a bit of humanity in it as well. The imagery when it comes to the animation is also innovative in a way that it adds quite a bit of emotion to the whole package. This is a thought provoking film with elements of seeing things from the other sides perspective, in another words it has a good dose of empathy. I am planning to see this one again to recollect certain parts and elements I might have missed.8.3/10"
112,Waltz with Bashir,7,21 October 2012,"Another one of those ""how special, it is animated""","This is nothing special really. Just your usual leftism documentary about war, nothing to brag about, nothing that normal people should lose their time watching. Also, to call it innovative because it is an animated ""documentary"", well, people, this is not a documentary at all. Unless you think that a documentary is a film with actors and script, which is what this is. This is a film that depicts real events (or is supposed to, I don't know the degree of distortion of the facts involved in making this film, it is usually high) that happens to be animated. This film is an interesting concept, but nothing really special and nothing to give a perfect score about, unless you are a sucker who thinks that it is ""audacious"" to make an animated film depicting real events. It is not. Period."
113,Waltz with Bashir,7,29 July 2012,Sad Story,"An animated film dealing with the Beirut War and Sabra massacre in 1982. Ari Folman was a nineteen year old soldier with the Israeli Army at the time. He is the writer and director of Bashir. In 2006, Folman meets a friend who also served and continued to suffer nightmares from the experiences, which Folman blacks out. By interviewing fellow soldiers, he realizes that he was responsible for firing flares into the air to light up the Palestinian refugee camp where so many people were slaughtered by the Lebanese Christian Militia. As the son of Holocaust survivors, he concludes that he was in an act of denial of the period which he was part of the murders of innocent civilians. Waltz with Bashir is well intentioned and made from Folman's haunted soul. Maybe someday the citizens of the world will figure out the dangers of religious fanaticism, whether it be Christian, Jewish, or Muslim. There is plenty of blood on all their hands."
114,Waltz with Bashir,10,3 March 2011,Outstanding story and animation movie,"A confronting and lacerating documentary animation movie that narrates the personal trip that director Ari Folman took to recover the memories of his participation in the invasion of the Lebanon and in the massacre of Sabra and Shatila in 1982, when he was a 19y.o. soldier in the Israeli Army.Different elements are shown in the movie, all interconnected.1/ There is a personal and intimate search for the lost memories and the reintegration of the forgotten traumatic past into the conscious. The story shows how post-traumatic disorder works in soldiers, how tricky and fanciful human memory is to forget anything that causes us inner pain and conflict. The recovery of the past memories as a way of psychological redemption of our identity. The trips and chats Folman had with some of his old friends and comrades in arms, and with one of the journalists who covered the events, helped him, and the viewer, to understand what happened to him.2/ There is a depiction of the reality of war, with its drama, blood, death, fear and happiness. You see the young soldiers, mostly teens, doing a job that overwhelms them and scares to death, and is that fear (and not hatred) what leads them to kill and to survive. I also shows the happy every-day moments in which there was no fighting involved: soldiers listening to music, talking about normal things in life, being normal people, showing their ignorance about what to do or how to do things, their lives back home, and so on.3/ There is the narration of the events leading to the massacre of Sabra and Shatila, in which thousands of Muslim civilians (mostly women, children and old people) were pitiless slaughtered by the Christian Phalangists with the passive-active connivance of the Israeli Army. We witnesses with horror, the impact that such barbaric acts had on the victims and on those who witnessed the events.The movie succeeds at presenting such a harsh story by combining different elements in a masterly way.[1] By creating an animated world that is alien and intimate at the same time, that sets the emotional tone of the movie. The animation style is unique, similar to rotoscopy animation, but is not rotoscopy but a mix of new animation techniques. The orange and beige hues of the movie, and the precise use of chiaroscuro, help to create an atmosphere that is ominous, real and unreal at the same time. The recurring image that Folman has -he and 2 other soldiers getting out the beach, naked, with a gun (the one reflected in the Poster) in a world full of destruction, oniric and unreal, shows very well the sense of spiritual abandonment, alienation and regret that such events created in the soul of Folman.[2] By pacing the research for the past memories as if it was a mystery movie. We walk side by side with the director ,putting together the pieces of his past at the same time he does. The tempo of the movie is great, as the uneasiness of the story and of the viewer increases, and ends with the final minutes of the movie, really shocking, not animated, with images of old news footage of the grotesque spectacle found after the ceasefire in the Muslim suburbs. They moved me to tears, bot of anger and of sadness.[3] By using an impacting and soulful soundtrack that touches the viewer. It mixes some classical music pieces, well known songs of the 1980s, and some songs and musical pieces specifically written for the movie.[4] By letting the oniric world to be depicted as a decisive element in confronting our reality and our past lying locked under our Conscious. The movie starts with a dream, and there are several oniric surrealist scenes in the movie.[5] By choosing to tell this story through animation and not through a conventional documentary, as it certainly has attracted more viewers and spread the story beyond what a normal documentary would have had.[6] By mixing the harsh images and sub-stories with others full of intimacy, lyricism and poetry, by showing the human and brutal face of humans.I truly loved the movie. Why don't give it a 100%? Because I would liked an explicit condemnation of the Israeli involvement in the massacre by the director, not only the implicit one in which the name of Ariel Sharon is clearly mentioned as the one who didn't move a finger to stop the massacre. In fact, the fact that just the Christian Phalangists are depicted as the animals and barbarians is incorrect, as if you see somebody killing somebody and don't do anything, you are are also guilty not to succour the person in need (especially when those are children, women and old people) and even more if you help them to do so by paving their way to the slaughter house.This is one of this movies that everybody should wash, not only because it is a piece of art, but not to forget that war debases us all, destroys the lives of all parts involved except of those politicians who started them, and whom we elect.One of the most amazing films of the last years.Fantastic."
115,Waltz with Bashir,,9 March 2009,Highly Original,"It's that time of year, after the Oscars, when I make the rounds of all the so called foreign language films, that is, the films not made in English (or even American....) Waltz With Bashir will be closely followed by The Class and Moscow Belgium (although the latter has only just been released.) Personally, I think some of the best movies come from overseas. I still reckon the German film, The Lives of Others, is one of the finest films I've ever seen.I love the medium of film, and I always find it fascinating to see how other nations use it. Ari Folman, an Israeli film maker, has certainly found a very original style of movie making, an adult documentary animation about war. When was the last time you saw an animation that wasn't cute and furry? I happen to love animation too, so this was a double attraction for me, foreign AND a cartoon. I'm not going to make any claims to be an expert on animation styles but it did strike me that Waltz With Bashir is extremely clever because it is deceptively simple; stylised drawings and a fairly straight forward but very effective colour palette. The grey buildings against the yellow sky will stay with me a long time, you could almost taste the dust in the ravaged city streets. It sets the mood for a heart breaking story about the nature of war where, as many others have already pointed out, everyone loses. It's a very original film, and had this jaded movie fan pinned to her seat barely moving for all ninety minutes - a rare achievement. The small theatre was quite gratifyingly full the night I saw Waltz With Bashir, but it was an art house theatre in a liberal town, so I guess that's not too big a surprise?An Israeli ex soldier has a recurring nightmare about being chased by a pack of 26 dogs - always the same number. He tells his friend Ari over a drink. Ari, an ex soldier himself, realises that he has blocked out his entire memory of the war in which they both fought, it's a blank to him. He sets out to talk to all his old colleagues and try to piece together his part in the conflict, the 1982 Lebanese invasion and subsequent battle that included the mass killings in Sabra and Shatila camps. The Bashir of the title was the leader of Lebanon whose assassination may have prompted the revenge killings in the camps.I really don't want to comment too deeply on the politics of the movie. It is obviously a labor of love from someone who was there and who was a very young man at the time, and who is still - almost thirty years later - trying to make some sense of what happened, and it is therefore both intriguing and moving. It could perhaps be viewed as some attempt at personal redemption. It is a worthwhile and noble enterprise and made, I felt, with great honesty. It is also a very fine achievement artistically and well worthy of its Oscar nomination. If you want to learn more about that period from what could, I guess, be called the other side of the fence, read Dr Pauline Cutting's book called - if I remember from this distance - Children of the Siege."
116,Waltz with Bashir,9,28 February 2009,"God save the Palestinians, we mean it, man","Would Alvy Singer take Annie Hall to go see ""Vals Im Bashir""? In the Academy Award-winning film, Alvy has his girlfriend sit through Marcel Ophuls' ""The Sorrow and the Pity"", a four-hour-plus documentary about France's collaboration with Nazi Germany during the war. Would it be in his nature to advocate a film that portrays his people as the oppressors rather than the oppressed? Victimization plays a big role in Alvy's persona, so a film about Israel's crimes against the Palestinians during the 1982 Lebanon War might not suit his narcissistic need to feel persecuted. ""Vals Im Bashir"" certainly has the intellectual rigorousness to meet Alvy's approval, especially for a, (gulp), cartoon. To dispel this ill-fitting label, the filmmaker uses Public Image Ltd.'s ""This Is Not A Love Song"" during the protagonist's sabbatical from the war in Beirut, as a way to comment on the motion picture's two-dimensionality; albeit an animated film, this is not a cartoon, content-wise, since ""Vals Im Bashir"" has more in common with the documentary form than live-action genres such as the musical, or science fiction. The song also foreshadows how the film drops its distancing use of animation during the jarring final minutes, when the hyper-reality of this pixelated dream-world starts to self-reflect in flesh and blood. ""Vals Im Bashir"" is a stringent parody, or rather, a drawn approximation of the filmic tradition that is neo-realism.Unarmed Armenians are gunned down in cold blood by a marauding Turkish army in Atom Egoyan's ""Ararat"", but then the camera pulls back to reveal that the callous bloodshed is just a scene for the film-within-the film. For this Canadian filmmaker(of Armenian descent), presenting the massacre without having that fourth wall to temper the loss of life might have been too graphic an ordeal for comfort. The Armenian Genocide, as the form suggests, is nearly unfilmmable, so Egoyan uses a distancing technique, a buffer, in which the slain extras get up from the ground. Likewise, with animation, the unfilmmable becomes filmmable; with animation, for example, the freedom to shoot a child, the smallest body in a lineup for an Israeli firing squad's disposal may not be a viable option in a live-action movie. Animation helps the violent imagery seem less palpable. It's non-fiction iconography told in a form, synonymous with fiction. In ""Vals Im Bashir"", the filmmaker's own private Lebanon War is pieced together by a number of interviews that he conducts with his former war-mates. Like Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) in John Frankenheimer's ""The Manchurian Candidate"", nightmares keep the protagonist up at night in this filmic bildungsroman. Besides the hounds of retribution dream, the protagonist asks the interviewees to help him decipher his reoccurring memory of a moonlit night, in which he emerged naked from the black ocean with three other soldiers at dusk. As it turns out, this gathering at the shoreline probably never took place. The protagonist is dreaming about a dream; the dream of the unforgiven, in which the sea can't absolve his unpardonable sin. This invented happening is a psychosomatic levee to hold back the deluge in his mind. There's no Janet Leigh-type in ""Vals Im Bashir""; he's his own controller.In the aftermath of an Israeli bombing on a Lebanese homestead, among the victims buried under the rubble, a young boy can be glimpsed in eternal repose. And then the film starts to dream, as ""Vals Im Bashir"" breaks more than the fourth wall, it breaks time and space, by switching to live-action, as the animated mothers who mourn their loved ones give way to their material predecessors. To paraphrase John Lydon in The Sex Pistols' ""God Save the Queen"", ""Israel's dreaming,"" but the protagonist is awake now. The documentary footage coincides with the protagonist's recovered memory; the veil is lifted from the pixelation to reveal the horror of his participation in the Palestinian holocaust. The live-action diegesis includes that dead child under the rubble, in the flesh, not in the mind's eye of an artist, the unfilmmable. Suddenly, it's all to visceral for both the subject, and the audience.This is not a cartoon; this is a documentary. This is a love song, dedicated to peace among the Israeli and Palestinian people."
117,Waltz with Bashir,,17 February 2009,Well Done,"Waltz With Bashir This film was so uniquely done that I wanted to see it twice to even begin to analyze the layers of this work. The animation was almost disconcerting in that it was dark and somber and not at all the bright happy animation our culture in the US is accustomed to. Right off the bat we are introduced to animated characters sitting in a bar drinking and smoking while in an intense conversation. The use of shadows and lighting throughout the film gave it a realistic sense even without live actors. The voice overs were very natural and gave a sense as though we were listening in on actual conversations. The story takes place as a man retraces his steps as a young soldier to piece together the missing moments in his mind through interviews with other people who were there and experts who could help him understand why he and others blocked out the events of the past. The composition of the shots throughout the film is such that it often feels like looking at a painting. The people are staged in the scene so that our eyes can analyze the situation and really get a sense of what the soldier was surrounded by and the destruction on all sides. Though the style of this film is unconventional, we are given a chance at the end to realize through contrast just how effective the animation choice really is. This formalistic style of exploring such a gritty subject matter is a brave and creative choice of the writer/director Ari Folman, who lived this story and whose commitment to this project shows in the quality of the film."
118,Waltz with Bashir,7,16 February 2009,"Ari Folman, an Israeli Film Director, presents an animated Documentary recounting his own life in Lebanon (1982).","Ari Folman, an Israeli Film Director, presents an animated Documentary recounting his own life in Lebanon (1982). Folman uses an artistic choice of animation to narrate his film. The use of animation provides him with the complete freedom to express his viewpoint without any limitations. This is a non political film as it doesn't illustrate the other side to the Palestinian or Christian's point of view. In the final scene, he successfully alters the emotion for us with the switch from animation to real life footage. The shocking images combined with the silence of the scene grabs the audience's attention. The authentic footage connects everything that the animation informs the audience about. The factual history allowed the audience to really grasp the tragedy of what happened. The message is, that behind the beautiful drawings and animation, there are real people who were massacred including women and children. The subtext simply articulates that war is useless, it is not glamorous, nothing good can happen from it."
119,Waltz with Bashir,7,19 July 2009,"Emotionally engaging, technically intriguing, intellectually shallow.","After watching the 3 well-know foreign films nominated for this year's Oscar, it's quite obvious to me why Waltz with Bashir lost out to the Japanese masterpiece Departures. I would even consider Entre Les Murs to be a way better film than this one.It's hard to tell whether this film is a documentary or a movie, one of the minor reasons why it lost out in the Oscars. Whatever format it is meant to be, I could not see anything really insightful, just a lot of recollections and imaginations, punctuated by animation graphics. The film has a good mix of story-telling and fact-finding, which gives it an easy pace and gripping plot line. But not for one moment in the film did I find myself beholden in deep thought.I don't know enough about the technical aspect of animation, but it is the first film of this kind of artistic presence I have seen. Aside from techniques, decent entertainment, and a lot of self-pity and blame-shifting, I didn't see how it even deserved a nomination in the Oscars."
120,Waltz with Bashir,7,7 April 2009,good but not great,"the movie is good but not great, aside from certain political differences and reasons on how and why the massacre has happened and who is responsible, I will not say I know the truth about this but at least the movie shed the light on what happened that time, I didn't view the issue as a part of the ongoing conflict in the middle east but in a rather more broader humanly way that's how the movie should be seen for you or anyone to get the message its not about anyone as much as its about the director memories about the war and the massacre so its based on some personal opinions and stories so I am not sure about how truthful this facts was,but at the end we can say that we have an emotional and humane film about war aside from the political sides and everything."
121,Waltz with Bashir,8,15 February 2009,A stunning animated film,"Waltz with Bashir is an extremely emotional film that explores the massacre of Sabra and Shatila. The director creatively chose to do the film as an animation, which adds a unique formalistic element to the very realistic story line. The story explores the post war memory loss of a group of Israeli soldiers who try to retrace their memories to further understand their part in the massacre. The main character has a dream which he further tries to interpret by piecing together pieces of his memory of the massacre. Throughout the story the film sheds light on the serious effects of war on soldiers, and the role play that governments have in such events. The color hues, musical collaboration, and over all mise-en-scène of the film are so carefully constructed. The story is justified by the amount of artistic development that the director Ari Folman arranged for this masterpiece. The entire film is animated, but the ending scene is actual footage of the massacre, which hits the viewer like a brick in the face, and epitomizes the sorrow one should feel while watching this film. It is a great movie with incredible creativity and originality. I give it a two thumbs up, and suggest every one go see it sooner or later."
122,Waltz with Bashir,7,7 February 2009,Great animation but what is it trying to say?,"The animation in this film was excellent but at the end I felt unsure what point the director was trying to get across. Some of the imagery is stunning, the scene where the three soldiers emerge from the Mediteranean and walk towards Beiruit in particular.The film starts with the director meeting an old army buddy from the invasion of Lebanon. His friend has the same war related dream over and over again. This makes the director wonder why he has no memories at all of his time in Lebanon. He sets out to talk to others he knew from the army and he gradually realises that he was near the infamous massacres by Lebanese Christian militia in the Shabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beiruit. Most of the film is about veteran Israeli soldiers remembering things that happened to them in Lebanon. This is interesting in itself but would obviously be of more interest to an Israeli audience.Towards the end of the film we see an Israeli TV reporter tell us about going into the refugee camps after the massacres and how it seems the Israeli army did nothing to prevent civilians being killed. (Even now there is no definite casualty figure). The film ends with actual footage taken by this TV crew in the camps, showing many dead bodies including children. The part would be of more interest to an international audience but is quite short and only somewhat related to the first 80 minutes of the film. I think there is definitely scope for a film about the experiences of Israeli soldiers and a separate documentary investigating the massacres. Here however the 2 separate themes are shoehorned uncomfortably together. Overrall I felt the film was neither one thing or another."
123,Waltz with Bashir,6,16 January 2010,An Animated Documentary,"WALTZ WITH BASHIR is really a film in a class of its own. It is, in a very real sense, an animated documentary. Which initially begs the question: ""Why?"" Why film it in an animated fashion rather than simply interviewing soldiers directly and showing the reality of it via real people? This will be the hardest hump to get over for most viewers. I know it was for me. Many times, I said to myself, ""Gosh, I'd really like to see the real thing here."" Some of it, I believe, was done to hide the true identities of those Israeli soldiers who might have been involved during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. And who could blame them. The disaster that is the Middle East still rages from day to day.The impression one gets from the film is that of a dream- (nightmare)-scape in which an Israeli soldier tries to piece together his memories (or lack thereof) regarding his time in the military and his involvement in the Lebanon invasion. This is shown in muted, yellow-ish colors that washes across the screen and gives the viewer a sense that something isn't quite right. And it isn't. The soldier is blocking something here, not wanting to remember, trying to put a positive spin (or absent spin) on what was surely a bloody mess. This was painful to watch on an emotional level because you knew that reality was far different, and far more brutal. One dream-scape involves the narrator being plucked off a boat by a beautifully large, buxom woman just before the boat explodes. One could only imagine the reality of what actually happened there.Comparisons between this film and PERSEPOLIS were also quickly made, as one is an animated autobiography and the other an animated war documentary. But Persepolis stands out as the better of these two for one distinct reason: Persepolis would NEVER have been allowed to be filmed in Iran. Plus, it was a much cruder representation, with black and white thick drawings indicating the strictness of the Iranian government. Whereas here with Waltz With Bashir, it it often full color with the narrator sitting around a coffee table chatting with someone about his war experiences. It pulled the story down to a crawl when this happened, which made it less enjoyable.Artistically speaking one can understand why director Ari Folman chose the animated medium in which to tell his story (the dream sequences are a prime example), but it still seemed just a tad forced, as if Ari were trying to do something different rather than telling a good story that probably (to my eyes) would've been more engrossing had it not been told via animation.Still, this is a unique film amongst the animation genre. And one that many people might find entertaining. I thought it was just okay."
124,Waltz with Bashir,6,22 December 2009,good,"This is an animated documentary about the director's efforts to find out what he did when he was in Lebanon during the Israeli invasion of the early 1980's. It seems that the director discovered that he did not remember a great deal of what happened and that he suspected that he may have been involved with notorious massacres in two refugee camps. As the director makes an effort to get in touch with old army buddies and anyone who might of have been in the area he finds that what everyone remembers is all colored differently and he discovers what a tricky thing our memories are.In the wake of great acclaim, numerous awards and a bit of controversy at the Oscars (many people felt it was the best documentary and animated film but it was instead nominated as Best Foreign Language film) I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I sat down to watch this film. I was expecting to have my socks knocked off. Instead I found that I wasn't all that impressed by what I was seeing. It's not a bad film, but at the same time I don't think its all that special. For me the problem is that I never connected with what was going on. Yes I was intrigued and yes I found some of the discussions about what happened and what was remembered interesting, but at the same time I was not connected emotionally. I never felt anything at any point, so that when the film switches in its final moments to live action footage of the massacre I wasn't moved, feeling that what I was seeing was a foregone conclusion of shock value.I think the problem comes from the organization of the material which meanders too much in the telling. Granted the purpose of the tale is the directors self revelations, but at the same time it's a bit too unfocused. On a personal level I found that the animation takes away from the personal accounts. Watching several of the sequences a couple of times, in Hebrew, in English and unanimated in the extras section of the disc, I found that I was moved more by the unanimated footage. Watching the interviews of the people with out their animated counterparts over them I found that I was moved more by what I was seeing. There was something about their facial expressions and body language that added to their tales. These factors I thought were diminished by the animation (in the interest of full disclosure I'm not a huge fan of the style of animation used to begin with) This isn't to say that the film is bad. It's not. It's an often compelling tale. I was often riveted by some of the stories told, for example the story of the soldier who was the only survivor of his tank crew and who swam out to sea to escape, the reporter striding through a battle that was killing all of the soldiers around him, and the sequences showing the collateral damage of war made me sit up and take notice, I just never connected for anything longer then a sequence.In the end the film is worth seeing. I just don't see that the film is as revelatory as some have made it out to be."
125,Waltz with Bashir,8,1 March 2009,"Offbeat, absorbing animation of Israeli Lebanese war veteran recollections","Ari Folman, the Israeli documentary filmmaker, has now come out with one of the most provocative and original anti-war films in quite awhile. Waltz with Bashir focuses on Folman's recollections as a young soldier in the Israeli Army during the war in Lebanon in 1982. It employs a combination of Flash, hand-drawn and computer-enhanced 3-D modeling.The film begins with jarring images of rabid dogs running wildly through the streets of Tel Aviv. It turns out that this is a recurring nightmare that Folman's Army veteran friend, Boaz, has been having for the past 2 ½ years. Folman himself has virtually drawn a complete blank as to his wartime memories except for one disturbing surrealistic image of he and two soldier comrades, completely naked, slowly wading through the ocean at night onto the beach in Beirut. Boaz urges Folman to try and recover his memories so he seeks out a succession of veterans who he was in combat with as well as other veterans who also had experiences in Lebanon.First Folman visits Carmi, an old friend who was in Folman's unit who is now a successful businessman in Holland. Carmi has no recollection of Folman's dream about wading onto the beach but recalls how when his unit first arrived in Lebanon all their training went out the window due to fear and they were firing their weapons continuously and indiscriminately when first entering enemy territory. This lack of discipline results in the Carmi's unit firing on a Mercedes that pops up out of nowhere, resulting in the death of a family inside the vehicle. On his way back to the airport to return to Israel, Folman begins to recover some of his repressed memories.The middle of Waltz with Bashir deals with further interviews with other Lebanon war veterans as well as with a psychiatrist who is an expert on post-traumatic stress disorder. The stories from these interviews are fascinating: one soldier is left on the beach after his tank is hit by RPG fire; after the other tanks retreat he hides from the PLO until nightfall and then swims in the ocean for miles and is luckily found by his own unit, miles from where they left him. Ironically, the soldier feels guilt that his fellow soldiers didn't make it and is also shunned by the surviving members of his unit who convey the unspoken message that he deserted his fallen comrades.Other disturbing stories emerge from Folman's interviews and recollections. A 10 year old Palestinian fires a hand-held missile launcher and blows up a tank; he in turn is blown away by an advancing group of Israeli soldiers in a grove of trees. An Israeli officer spends his down-time fast-forwarding a German porn tape inside a captured villa. And as a group of soldiers are pinned down as they're being fired upon from skyscrapers at the beach front in Beirut, a soldier does his ""Waltz with Bashir"" as he wheels round and round, firing his machine gun up at snipers, managing to avoid being hit (Posters of Bashir, the soon-to-be assassinated Christian Prime Minister, appear everywhere in Beirut and are seen in the background as the soldier fires wildly at the snipers).Waltz with Bashir culminates in an examination of the infamous massacre of approximately 3,000 Palestinians by Christian Phalangist militiamen in the refugees camps of Sabra and Shatila. One thing is clear: the Israelis were not directly responsible for participating in the massacre although many people in the Muslim world still believe that the Israelis were direct participants. One of the film's weaknesses is the failure to point out that the Palestinians were not the ONLY victims of the Lebanon war and that massacres were committed by the PLO against Christians prior to massacres in the refugee camps.Nonetheless, an Israeli commission found the Army (under the head of Ariel Sharon) to be responsible for allowing the Phlangists into the refugee camps and acting indifferently, allowing the massacres to occur. The Commission concluded that the Army should have known that the Phalangists were out for revenge given the murder of Bashir two days before as well as the history of bad blood between the two groups.It finally comes back to Folman; he wasn't on the front lines right next to the camps but was stationed on a rooftop where flares were continually being shot up, allowing the Phalangists to commit their horrific deeds while the sky was lit up during nighttime. Folman obviously feels a great deal of remorse for the Israeli soldiers' inaction during the massacre. Some writers here feel that Folman's viewpoint is one of a left-wing, self-hating Jew. But is it? Given the Jewish people's own victimization during the Holocaust, one would think they should hold themselves to a higher standard; despite being continually attacked by the PLO, they still had a responsibility to minimize civilian casualties.Waltz with Bashir employs an eclectic soundtrack including pop songs from the period of the Lebanese War which adds to the film's verisimilitude. Coupled with the unique animation and the introspective voice-overs, Bashir points out the cost of the war in terms of human suffering as well as the deleterious psychological effects upon the surviving veterans.Waltz with Bashir's final shots, where the animation is dispensed with and we see the actual scenes of the aftermath of the refugee camp massacre, is the only heavy-handed moment in the film. It's at that point we feel that the filmmaker has discarded his introspective, personal outlook and tried to make a political point. Despite the awkward ending, Waltz with Bashir is filled to the brim with jarring images that will remain with you for a long time, narrated by men who have been through hell."
126,Waltz with Bashir,6,6 March 2016,Waltz with Bashir,"I knew this Israeli / Hebrew film was animated, and I knew it had something to do with a war, but I had no idea it was a real life subject, it is essentially like A Scanner Darkly, cartoon imagery put over the real life filming. Basically in 1982, Ali Forman was aged nineteen and working for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as an infantry soldier, in 2006, he meets former army friend who tells him of his nightmarish experiences from the Lebanon War. Folman is surprised he cannot remember anything from this period, but later at night he has a vision from the night of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, he cannot clearly recall the realities of it, he has memories of himself and fellow soldier comrades bathing by the seaside in Beirut at night under the light of descending flares. Folman meets with a childhood friend who advises him to find other people in Beirut at the same time to understand what happened there and revive his own memories. Folman, amongst others, meets friends and other soldiers who served in the Lebanon War, a psychologist, and Israeli TV reporter Ron Ben- Yishai who covered Beirut at the time. Folman eventually realises he was with soldiers surrounding the Palestinian refugee camp, he was among those soldiers firing flares in the sky for the Lebanese Christian Phalange, and a massacre was perpetrated inside. Folan concludes that his amnesia of the war stemmed from his feeling as a teenage soldier that he was as guilty of the massacre as those who committed the atrocity, the end of the film dissolves from animation into actual footage of the aftermath of the massacre. With contributions from Ronny Dayag, Dror Harazi and Ori Sivan. The documentary has a very different and ingenious concept, memories from a bleak time history are reignited after twenty-five years, with the war stories presented in flash and 3D animation, adding to the surrealistic edge of the film, it doesn't shy away from the dark moments, with traumatic and almost hallucinatory sequences of the horrors of war and the crimes committed during, all together it is a most interesting animated documentary. It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, it was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Animated Film. Good!"
127,Waltz with Bashir,,19 May 2014,Palestine Blues,"""If I'd been doing public relations for the Israeli army, I couldn't have thought of a more brilliant scheme to get them off the hook. Suddenly the villains were Christian militiamen! But in the two months of the siege, the Israelis established that everyone in west Beirut was a legitimate target; they hit every part of the city, using the vilest of modern weapons and showing absolutely no concern for the lives of civilians."" - Tony Clifton (""God Cried"") An animated documentary, Ari Folman's ""Waltz With Bashir"" watches as a group of Israeli Defence Force soldiers acknowledge that they've been repressing a very specific memory: after the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, IDF forces stood back and watched as Christian sects murdered 3500 Palestinian and Shite civilians in what would come to be known as the Sabra and Shatila massacre. Folman then likens Israel's behaviour to that of Nazi concentration guards during the Holocaust. Ironically, whilst the film pretends to be about an admittance of guilt, it's largely an act of evading responsibility. The IDF supported Christian militias for years, the massacre in question lasted days (not hours as shown in the film), and the IDF was directly responsible for tens of thousands of deaths during the conflict, not ""indirectly responsible"" for a single massacre as shown.Some context: Britain ruled Palestine during the 1920s and 1930s. Palestinians waged a long civil war with the British, attempting to kick them out. In 1947, Britain pulled out and rigged UN votes led to Palestine being split in two (wholly illegally, the Security Council never approving the policy). One chunk went toward ""Arabic"" Palestinians, the other became the newly formed state of Israel. Zionists agreed with this mandate, but the Arab High Committee didn't. The civil war which began against the British then turned against the newly founded state of Israel.In 1948, some 700,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes. 55 percent of Palestine was then given to Jews who previously controlled 7 percent of the land and made up less than 30 percent of the population. Meanwhile, more Jews are flown in from around the world. Israel deems Palestinians ""not indigenous"", whilst ignoring the fact that not all Jews descend from ancient Hebrews (whilst many Palestinians do). As Israel grows, the Arab-Israel war intensifies. Partially in response to sixteen high profile massacres (which would morph into 33), the most famous being the Deir Yassin massacre, five nations attack Israel. Israel, though oft portrayed as victim (she was both victim and oppressor), outnumbers all Arab/Palestinian combatants combined. Each side believes they are in the right. The massacres continue.By the end of the war, Israel captures 78 percent of Palestinian land. Towns are obliterated and renamed, maps are redrawn and 750,000 Palestinians find themselves refugees. After decades of squabbles, the Six Day War begins in 1967 with Israeli launching surprise air-raids on Egypt (Israel, the UK and France had warred with Egypt over ownership of the Sinai peninsula several times before). Here Israel swiftly occupies the last remaining 22 percent of Palestinian land, as well as parts of Egypt, Sinai and Syria (the Golan Heights, never returned). As the years go by, Palestine would come to resemble a giant concentration camp, walls and checkpoints erected, its infrastructure annihilated and more land slowly confiscated. Roughly 8 million dollars a day would flow from the US to Israel, the tiny nation now a regional superpower. Meanwhile, Israel increasingly uses ""Palestinian rocket attacks"" to justify their militancy (about 12 Israelis died to Palestinian rockets over the past 2 decades). Numerous peace plans are drawn up (most famously UN 242), most of which are rejected for very specific reasons: the fear that a Palestinian majority will develop within Israel (""the demographic problem"") and the fear that acquired land and settlements, all of which are deemed illegally stolen by the International Court of Justice, will have to be returned (""the withdrawal problem""). Since 1976, there has been overwhelming international consensus in support of a two state plan in keeping with internationally recognised borders. The consensus includes Arab states and the Organisation of Islamic States. The US and Israel have blocked these proposals for almost 4 decades.The Palestinian Liberation Organisation was formed in 1964. Since 1974 it has been recognised by the UN and most other nations as the ""government"" of Palestine. Israel views it as a ""terrorist organisation"". The PLO would recognise Israel's right to exist in peace in 1993, accepting UN242 and rejecting all violence and terrorism. Also ""representing"" Palestine is Fatah, a major political party within the PLO, founded by Yasser Arafat, and Hamas, an ultra right-wing, demented offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, once backed by Britain/Mossad to essentially destroy the PLO and provide justification for Israeli counter-violence.In 1982, after years of trying to trigger ""internationally recognised provocation"", Israel invaded Lebanon outright. The invasion was justified with a very specific lie: the assertion that the PLO, which represented over 300,000 Palestinian refugees in Southern Lebanon, was behind an attempted assassination on an Israeli ambassador. Meanwhile, Israel launches hundreds of illegal incursions into Lebanon between 1980-82, as well as bombing runs on refugee camps. The 1982 invasion was used to expel the PLO from Lebanon, dethrone the Lebanese government and install in Lebanon a pro-Christian leader called Bachir Gemayel. The PLO headquarters would move to Libya. The militant organisation, Hezbollah, backed by Syria and Iran, was formed in response to the invasion.Throughout the 1970s, Lebanese Christian sects were backed/armed by Israel and UK. They included the South Lebanese Army and the Kataeb Party (the Lebanese Phalanges Party), a violent, right-wing sect. These groups used the 1982 Lebanese invasion, and Israeli air-raids, as cover for larger attacks on Palestinian refugees. Israel gave them explicit carte blanche to do this, one result being the Sabra and Shatila massacre.6/10  Nightmarish, powerful but thin. Worth one viewing."
128,Waltz with Bashir,9,6 December 2013,A Revolutionary Movie in Storytelling and Animation.,"Waltz With Bashir (Vals Im Bashir) Is A Great Film. But Its Also A New Step In Filmmaking. Ari Folman makes a rare type of film that no one sees. Animation and Documentary combined. This is one of the most revolutionary films ever made because its a new way of telling a story and a new type of animation having some of the most realistic character models in a animated film to date.The film follows Folman as he interviews soldiers from The Deadly Lebanon War to get his memories from the war back as he was a soldier. The stories are shocking with each soldier telling his POV of the war. Folman is not trying to point fingers here. He is trying to show the effects of war like other films do (Das Boot, The Hurt Locker) and does a terrific job at it.I like that they are very careful not to make this film to colorful. Most of the colors in the film are black, Grey, green, brown and yellow. If the film had too many colors like red and blue and pink, then the film would look strange and odd. Without all these colors, the film looks Grimm and hell-like. Thats what Folman was trying to do here.I am so impressed by this film. It is sure to become one of the greatest films of the millennium.92/100 A-"
129,Waltz with Bashir,,8 October 2013,A Documentary. A War Drama. A Historical Account. A Biography.,"A documentary. A war drama. A historical account. A biography. Waltz with Bashir qualifies as each one of these, in addition to being a gripping & powerful tale being told through the medium of animation. Depicting the horrors of war in an emotionally engaging manner, this animated documentary only gets more unsettling as the story progresses.The story of Waltz with Bashir is narrated in two timelines. The first one is set in present day Israel and finds Ari Folman, this film's director, meeting & interviewing fellow veterans of the First Lebanon War, the time period he happens to have no recollection of despite serving in the military that time. The second timeline is set in 1982 and illustrates Israel's invasion of Lebanon.Written & directed by Ari Folman, who also stars in the film as himself, Waltz with Bashir is crafted with immaculate precision, composure & attention to detail from start to finish and is brought to life in a unique manner, thanks to its pioneering animation which resembles a comic book illustration. The script is deftly penned down & its transition on the film canvas is thoroughly captivating.Technical aspects exhibit a lot of inventiveness here for its Cinematography makes stellar use of its camera, colour hues & lighting to expertly capture the feel & flavour of this story. Editing brilliantly paces its 90 minutes of story and makes sure each sequence plays a role in the final print. Max Richter's score is absolutely fitting. And the animated characters are splendidly voiced & also appear similar to their respective real-life figures.On an overall scale, Waltz with Bashir is an aesthetic, artistic & surreal piece of cinema that presents its writer-director in complete control of his craft as he attempts to regain the lost memories of his service in the First Lebanon War and in the process ends up adding a new chapter to the manual of filmmaking. A work of quality that will be able to score highly no matter what genre(s) one puts it into, Waltz with Bashir comes strongly recommended."
130,Waltz with Bashir,9,2 May 2013,A treat to watch,"One of the more brilliant films I have seen recently. It is the first animated documentary film I have seen and the montage is so effective that it made me wonder why is this not a more popular medium.The plot is kept gripping through the lens of the self-portrayal of the director who is searching for his lost memories of the war. It focuses on the psychology of the military men and the measures their minds resort to cope with the stress. The dealing of the actual massacre is not heavy handed and is approached in a balanced way, that leaves the audience with a burning desire to find out more about what transpired and how the collective failure of conscience of 3 groups of military men was brought about through systematic delegation.The auto-ethnographic angle helps focus on the non-political and a more humane angle of Sabra and Shatila massacre of 1982, which to me was the most novel aspect of the film that experiments with a lot of ideas of movie making and pushes the limits of cinema.Brilliantly pieced together with a comic-esque feel, Waltz with Bashir will stay in my head for the title sequence. A rash, callous and incomprehensibly inhuman act is described as a waltz. Accompanied with music that is befitting of the interpretation of the scene, it is among the best sequences in movies."
131,Waltz with Bashir,,26 March 2013,The journey to the original self,"This is a film heavily about memory, about the filmmaker's memory of his part as an IDF draftee in the Lebanese War of '82, about, perhaps, a nation's collective memory of having had to escape all that and the hallucinative boundaries of 'truth'. It's the third of three consecutive films I saw in as many days, where Israeli filmmakers bring to cinematic life their traumatizing personal experience of war, the other two being Kippur and Lebanon.In a way, all good film is about memory. It may not be expressly the subject matter, or indeed the filmmaker's personal memory, as here, but the function of imagining, which is the same function as dreaming and remembering, wouldn't work unless we had deeply embedded images in ourselves and the ability to recall them before us. We do, unimaginably rich stores of images, dynamic, evolving in time as is memory.And it can be said, without being too fussy about it, that everything we see are reflections of images put before the mind, illusory in nature. This is not the same as being false, but we'll get to that. The conundrum? Explaining this unreality in words reduces, it's a clumsy burden. If the mind is like a mirror, it's like touching the spot on the mirror you want to show, smudged the moment you do. So great art to my mind, like meditation, is the effort to touch without touching, to draw transparent air between ourselves and images. This touching without touching also applies to viewing a film.So here we have a filmmaker on a journey of memory, not trying to unearth simply some obscure corner but the whole story of a past self, the story as a single image. It's a Citizen Kane of sorts, with the filmmaker in the role of 'reporter' visiting friends and acquaintances of old as he begins to fill the picture.It's flawed, in that what it explains point blank about memory and dissociation is slim stuff, notation instead of music. It obscures truths by intellectual analysis, as much so as Waking Life does with dreams. Thankfully, those moments are few and you can brush them aside with ease.What's really worth it here, is puzzling a bit about the nature of this. Oddly pitched as a documentary, but it's not. How could it be? It's about a dreaming self who twists images. Malleable reality before our eyes. What it is, wonderfully so, is a narrator 're-discovering' his story.So it's fitting to have it be animated, every image constructed, illusory. And how rich the illusion! Some of it obvious hallucination, some of it unreal impression, some of it absurdly real. Some of it from the point-of-view of others. Utterly evocative as a whole, especially the dance.He tethers all these images into his story, wonderful images. As he does, the mysterious image of boys emerging from sea acquires all these different shades of reality, gradually becoming more 'real' as they light up his night sky. It's a magical scene that recurs several times in the film.This is the 'truth' here, peeling away different layers to discover the original image. This image is the last we see, a shattering moment in the film. The rest of the story as only the vessel to having witnessed the moment, the softening of edges of truth as we swim there.So a bit of Zen to meditate upon. Who is that self who witnesses the scene of distraught women? I mean as you watch the film, what is he to you? Is he another character being recalled? Is he the narrator causing the story to be remembered years later? Is he the original self 'found' again, or not? You must study this."
132,Waltz with Bashir,10,28 December 2012,An animated autobiographical documentary.,"A documentary that is equivalent to the motion pictures like Schindler's List and Hotel Rwanda, by its presentation of the inhuman massacre, the war and the fanaticism arising from the war.It was a bold, yet brilliant attempt by Ari Folman, to make a documentary of a war he was a part of, but has forgotten with passing years, just like everyone else. He, with the help of his friends, who too were enlisted for the attack on Lebanon, were in their late teens and were consumed by the zeal to kill at will. None of them remember the exact details of the war, but they help Ari complete the jigsaw puzzle of the war by recollecting their personal experiences.While the main plot deals with Ari Folman retracing his memory and the horror of battle every one of his fellow recruits had to endure, a sub, yet pivotal plot includes the inhuman massacre of Palestinian civilians. The assassination of the elected President triggers the massacre among his zealous acolytes and the Israeli forces, of which the filmmaker was a part of, are unaware of the genocide conducted by the Christian Phalangists.The documentary is animated except for the last few minutes of running time, that shows the archive footage of women crying in the midst of a razed refugee camp with dead bodies piled up all over the place.A 10/10, without the slightest hesitation."
133,Waltz with Bashir,9,4 September 2012,Not enjoyable--nor should it be.,"""Waltz With Bashir"" is a film about the 1982 Lebanon war from the point of view of the Israeli soldiers who fought there. However, HOW it is told is pretty interesting. First, it's not live action but drawn in a very unusual roto-scope looking manner. It's very striking and original. Second, instead of being set during this war, it begin many years later--when an ex-soldier realizes he has very few memories of the war and decides to track down fellow soldiers to jog his memories--memories that were hindered by post-traumatic stress disorder. After all, they'd witnessed a lot of horrible things--including the Philangist Christians entering the Muslim camps and liquidating people. The film does not say that the Jews committed these murders, but also drew parallels to the Nazis and the Holocaust--a sobering parallel indeed. Overall, a tough film to watch (it's not surprising, since this war was so barbaric) but one that I highly respect and a quality production throughout. Well worth seeing but be careful about letting kids watch this one."
134,Waltz with Bashir,10,18 August 2012,Perhaps the Most Powerful Film I've Ever Seen,"This movie, to me, is incredible. It shook me so hard the first time I watched it that it took me days to actually properly process it all in my head. It overwhelmed me with unforgettable images, haunting music, and an intriguing plot that actually plays out somewhat like a mystery. I won't go into the plot itself, because all the other reviewers have already summarised it pretty well. Also, you should really go into this film knowing as little about it as possible- it's one of those kinds of movies. The film is remarkable for not taking a political side in the conflicts that it explores. Instead, it a deeply personal film where we travel into the dreams, flashbacks, and hallucinations of numerous ex-soldiers who are all trying to remember a war they fought in 20 odd years ago. Everything in Waltz With Bashir works perfectly, and it amazingly manages to be so many different things in just 90 minutes. It's a fascinating documentary. a powerful anti-war film, a riveting drama, a beautiful animation, a compelling mystery, and even somewhat of a chilling horror films of sorts- all at once. Hell, if that's not enough, it even throws in a few instances of surrealism and black comedy. And it balances all these elements perfectly. It's also extremely emotional. I can almost guarantee it'll have a profound impact on you. It's a remarkable film in every conceivable way, and I'd gladly place it in my top fifteen films of all time. A comfortable 10 out of ten from me."
135,Waltz with Bashir,8,22 July 2012,"Not a real 'documentary,' but documents the truth brutally.","War is a terrible thing. People use it for different purposes, but it only has one result: destruction. Waltz with Bashir demonstrates this perfectly, following one soldier 20 years later as he tries to remember his part in the 1982 Lebanon invasion. Going from friend to friend, hearing their sordid tales, his own memories come back, ending in his part of a massacre of civilians. The music and direction work together beautifully to build a haunting atmosphere for this mesmerizing journey. The animation also is vibrant, and the juxtapositions are beautiful. That said, I wasn't a fan of the animation as it often came off as static, much like a flash-animation toon (unable to rotate the characters or have fluidity). But that's a minor quirk in such a poetic and memorable film."
136,Waltz with Bashir,10,8 May 2012,"If u haven't seen it, do it now!!","I am not a fan of war movies or documentaries of any type, for the matter. The bare reality of these kinds of films have never made for a good movie experience for me. But Waltz with Bashir proves to be a singular experience. The narration is gripping, the use of animation makes room for a larger audience, pulling people like me who love all the Disney movies. It's almost poetic and feels like an orchestra. The director did not just fascinate me, but won my heart. And he did what he meant to do, he pulled me in to that particular loop of his life, showed it to me as he had seen it, and made me feel what he felt. It is not just an amazing movie, it is THE movie. If you haven't watched it yet, it's about time you do. A complete breathtaking celluloid experience for 90 minutes."
137,Waltz with Bashir,10,28 March 2012,"Visually stunning, compelling and really hit me hard","I had heard nothing but good things about Waltz With Bashir, and after finally seeing it, I found it every bit as good as I'd heard. Waltz With Bashir is stunning visually, the mix of live-action(used in the meetings footage) with flash animation and 3D has a very stirring and somewhat seductive look to it. Not only that, but the guilt and trauma of those involved seen in hallucinatory ways are almost suureal. The interviews are honest and compelling, with Ari Folman(directing and presenting with a superb and I think personal touch) making no time excusing the Israeli Army's role in the massacre, making some of Waltz With Bashir real, powerful and often incredibly hard-hitting.Overall, harrowing, powerful and striking visually. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
138,Waltz with Bashir,10,9 May 2011,Vals im Bashir: Indescribably Important,"It's funny that the most well-regarded films, the ""classics of world cinema"", are the ones which I most fervently avoid. The fear of disappointment in the face of excess hype; the distrust of the popular consensus; the experience of finding many ""great films"" to be far from that: many are the reasons I was hesitant approaching Vals im Bashir.An animated documentary, Vals im Bashir follows director Ari Folman's journey to discover just what happened to him during the Lebanon war in 1982, his mind having almost entirely repressed his memories. Speaking to marginally fictionalised versions of his then comrades, he comes to reconstruct both their stories and his, and rediscovers the horror of war.An interesting case in terms of its form alone, Vals im Bashir appears to have given rise to a plethora of questions regarding documentary film, and the surprisingly thin line which separates it from pure fiction. Folman's story is certainly a true one, his quest to uncover his trauma-hidden past in no way staged, but simply reconstructed and relived. His characters may not be exact replicas of their real-world counterparts, but they serve only to protect identity and maintain anonymity. The combination of documentary and animation is worthy of comment too, a mixture I'd not encountered before, and one I suspect is all too rare. What it achieves is to allow the narrator, and the audience with him, wild flights of fantasy, dream sequences, and fantastical visions of the past that combine to create a fully informed picture of the issue at hand. With the animation, Folman pulls us into the subject much more firmly than he would be able to were this a traditional talking head documentary format. We are able to experience the scenes of war, to see the described scenarios played out in a way which, though obviously fictionalised, is scarily realistic. The aforementioned flights of fantasy never fly too far from the horror on the ground, a swim with a gigantic mermaid interrupted by a missile raid, the dream of escaping to anywhere around the globe disturbed by the realisation that the airport is a hollow shell of what it once was. There is a lingering lugubriousness to the film, a resounding sorrow that builds to a tragic and terrifying crescendo of buried emotion. The questions of guilt and responsibility are the film's primary concerns, and ones which are explored in a subtle but comprehensive manner. Folman uncovers his own guilt as he does that of his nation, the repression not his alone. The film's slow atmosphere, making us feel as though we are soldiers wading through the mud to some eventually terrible destination, is entirely down to the music. The score's role is indescribably important to this film, the mournfulness it contributes paramount to our eventual emotional fatigue. Expect to be fully drained, wearied, and burned out by the time the credits arrive, the pacing combining with the deathly tone to assure the maximum impact is inflicted upon us. The final moments of the film, wherein we are exposed to newsreel footage of what we have just witnessed unfold, utilises the film's interplay between fact and fiction, informing us that this is concrete reality, that there is no escape, and that these horrors can never be undone.Among the most emotionally affecting, thought-engaging, draining, and impactful films I have ever sat through, Vals im Bashir transcends the limitations of its combined media to present us with perhaps the most effective war film that has yet graced the screen. Playing with reality and our perception thereof but never straying from it, it employs an atmosphere of impending tragedy, a score to accompany it beautifully, and effulgently darkened palettes to present the best argument for peace you are ever likely to find."
139,Waltz with Bashir,10,19 April 2011,Unrivalled,"Generally I'm a pretty mentally strong with an ability to control and distance my emotions from movies no matter what the subject matter. Anyway, I saw this film for the first time a week ago and I cry every time I've thought about it since. Which really is a tremendous endorsement of the movie itself. I don't think any other movie has ever had quite such a profound effect on me. One relaxes into the quite brilliant animation throughout the film, and can deal with the topics raised therein, because the animation creates a visual and psychological barrier between the audience and the reality of the subject matter. This makes the the climax of the movie all the more effective and powerful - when it cuts to real footage of the entry into the refugee camp - which i wasn't expecting - well it's just devastating. Absolutely devastating.This film will haunt me for a long time to come. An absolute must see."
140,Waltz with Bashir,6,20 December 2010,pass the buck,"This movie is very novelty because of cartoon cartoon,it infrequency. The infrequency is very good,tally with those scenes. Arab do that ? Without Israel army support ?! At last of this movie,director show us that women crying,what are they say?! I admire the courage of the director,he still do something for the tragedy bloodbath. But sometime we can hear parlance of bloodbath suspicion. This a rarity fife! I like it. Maybe Israel army do not shoot,maybe all bullets fire from Kataeb Party,so,we can say ""all this massacre without Israel""? What time we can see peace in Palestine ? I don't know. What did other people think? I guess statesmen don't care about it. Who can bless them ?"
141,Waltz with Bashir,10,22 September 2010,There's no way to stay indifferent to this film,"One of the very rare films (I believe actually the only one) where I had to close my eyes for certain scenes and one of these where you need some minutes and some beers afterwards to cope. But extremely informative and aesthetically wonderful. Aesthetically Ari Folman chose a drawing style that is beautiful while staying sober and dark. Obviously exuberance would have been inappropriate but the choice of animation over filming was necessary. People cannot stand the five last minutes, so imagine trying to watch the same kind of images, on a film-length. We are not just talking about soldiers dying and killing enemy soldiers. We are talking about a butchery. So this choice was necessary, but it remains that the style is great and the mixing of techniques gives enough realism for people not to forget we are on the documentary territory, not in the fiction one. One friend said a few years ago that only the Isareli cinema was producing quality nowadays. I just cannot do otherwise than agreeing. The 2000 years in cinema are the years of the Middle-East."
142,Waltz with Bashir,8,21 September 2010,Waltz with Bashir,"The 1982 war between Israel and Lebanon cost the lives of thousands of people and left a lot of Southern Lebanon destroyed, not to mention intensifying the long-standing political unrest in the area. Ari Folman's animated film Waltz with Bashir examines the effects of the war on modern Israelis using means of animation and documentary to create a memorable piece of war cinema. Set in present day, the story begins when Folman listens to his friend Boaz describe his recurring nightmares caused by the war and realizes that he himself has lost his ability to remember his experiences at the front. In order to recollect his memories again to sort his feelings out, Folman begins a journey to interview many of his fellow veterans and other people who went through the gruesome battles or witnessed the atrocities committed by the Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians.Even though the film has been advertised as a documentary, it is in many ways closer to a dreamlike art film. The structure of the film, relaying largely on interviews and voice-over narration as opposed to written dialog, is raised to another level by the animated visuals that cover the entire film apart from some brief clips of archive footage at the very end. The interviewees' memories are portrayed in stylized flashbacks where dreams and personal, subjective perception of things is favoured over cold observing. Among the most surreal of the scenes are a drunken soldier's memory of floating in the sea on the top of a nude woman while his friends' boat is bombed to pieces nearby and the eponymous ""waltz"" that a crazed soldier performs with a machine gun on a plaza decorated with huge pictures of Bashir Gemayel, the assassinated president of Lebanon. The use of beautiful classical music also heightens the poetic, distanced feel floating all over the film, even though there are also outright comedic scenes accompanied by rock and pop songs that firmly anchor the story's base in the contemporary reality of those involved.The animation was created partly by computers, and while the drawing style looks very nice and suits the film's art-house mood well, the movements often come across as more stilted and crude than in the best hand-drawn films. The yellow hue in the recurring dream of naked soldiers rising from the sea and walking through the city looks beautiful though, and a certain amount of artificialness can be seen as an essential part of the film's nature as a collection of partially buried subjective memories.To properly comment on the film's alleged downplaying of the Israelis' role in the massacring of Palestinian civilians, one would need political knowledge greater than mine, but emotionally the film certainly doesn't sugarcoat the scenes of executing and mistreating refugee families. The final, non-animated shots of grieving women on a destroyed street are presented with no music or other kind of accompaniment, allowing the images' inherent power to speak for itself  there's no way the ending could be seen as anything but strongly anti-war. As effective as the ending is, it felt slightly abrupt while watching; I would have been interested in seeing more of a conclusion for Folman's struggle to uncover his suppressed memories and to gain an understanding of his own feelings, even though a neat and tight little wrap-up is not needed in a tale like Waltz.Recapping my thoughts about the film, I think Waltz with Bashir is definitely an impressive work that successfully combines the strengths of the genres it belongs to. I have yet to see more than a few Israeli films, but Bashir gives no reasons to not delve deeper into the country's cinema, so I will join the numerous critics who have been addressing praise to Folman's effort  it is surely one of the best recent war films I have seen."
143,Waltz with Bashir,9,13 February 2010,A rare thing.,"This isn't exactly a good movie considering drama, it has lengths all over the place, (interviews... interesting but far too long) but that didn't really matter to me. I'm always entertained by animation in itself, no matter if its hand-drawn, 3D, CGI in general or whatnot. This was done in Flash (of all the choices out there -.- )if I remember correctly, but Cell shaded looks are still a favorite of mine so this was a gold mine.There were other scenes that were very enjoyable to watch. Enjoyable from a movie-making POV. I liked the horses, the rocket kid, the waltz, returning home for a week, and the good morning Lebanon sequence. This movie is made up of many little episodes not really hanging together, so that it should keep you interested cause there's always something new happening.Considering the message, its nothing all to fancy. This documentary doesn't spread the guilt, it just tells events leading up to a tragedy. Everyone and no one, thats all there is to it, thats all there ever is.One may question the necessity of doing this animated. The way I see it, it might be about the dream sequences, but I don't really think so. Ultimately its about the last few scenes of real footage, and nothing else. Seeing 80 Minutes of Animation and then being thrown into the real thing is a brilliant move to nail this movie and anything in it straight into your head. So you don't forget? Maybe, possibly, I don't know. What I know is that it worked that way for me. Not too many movies do that.What I also know is that the cinema (about 50 people) fell eerily quiet at the end. From this moment to the next, just like that. Masses of people are never that quiet. It only happened a few times in my life. When there was a minute's silence for someone, at the end of Dancer in the Dark and at the end of this movie. No rustling, no whispers, no breathing, no nothing except a few select suppressed chokes. This kept on through the equally quiet credits and when we were back on the street it took a third of a cigarette to start talking. We didn't stop for a while. And thats when you realize you just saw a great movie."
144,Waltz with Bashir,8,24 December 2009,"Good, but not best of year","Don't get me wrong, this IS a good movie. But not a great movie. The Story telling is the best part, but you don't intimately connect with the Characters. Partly because the way the animation was done was purposely with metaphors and hyperbole. It makes it surreal so the real characters are kept at a distance from the viewer.Yes, there's a strong emotional message about genocide. But that's not particularly gripping. Actually, I think that misses the message of the movie. Which is the minds ability to block out and even change our actual memories."
145,Waltz with Bashir,10,18 December 2009,"""Animated"" is the least descriptive term for this","Describing this film as ""animated"" is about as useful as describing another as ""live action"". I've always thought the distinction has become more meaningless especially in the last couple of decades. It's really just a technical designation, like mentioning what kind of microphones were used or what kind of cameras were used.Animated films Toy Story, Waltz With Bashir, Fritz The Cat and Fantasia have about as much to do with each other as live action films The Wizard of Oz, Apocalypse Now, Psycho and The 40 Year Old Virgin do. It's a bit ridiculous to have an animated category at an awards show, except if the award is merely for the technical execution of the animation itself.I'm trying to figure out if the final live action scene had a huge impact on me because of how it evolved from animation or because of the simple insanity of the situation irrespective of the technical delivery."
146,Waltz with Bashir,10,10 November 2009,Brilliant animated documentary,"Many people think that if a film is animated it must be for children; this film is definitely not for children as it features graphic images of combat and a brief sexually explicit scene, it is not gratuitous though.Due to the fact that this is animated it does not feel like a documentary nor does it feel like we are being lectured to. Ari is a film director who realises that he can't remember his experiences in the war in 1982 where Israeli forces went to war in Lebanon and allowed local paramilitaries to massacre Palestinian in two refugee camps.In order to find out what happens he interviews those people he knew were with him there, as his former colleagues tell their stories we are shown images of their war, some are realistic depictions of what happens to them and others are surreal even hallucinatory. It is clearly a very personal film showing the war from the point of view of Ari and his fellow soldiers rather than trying to give an overall picture of the reasons for the war or the politics of the region... that would require a long series not a ninety minute film.The animation was is brilliantly done and suited the subject matter surprisingly well, so well in fact that I'm not sure we needed to see the archive footage showing the aftermath of the massacre at the end to realise just how bad it was, that said it did not detract from the film and if it helped any viewers appreciate what happened then it justified its inclusion."
147,Waltz with Bashir,9,26 August 2009,Genres converge to tell a truthful war story in a unique way,"There's very little gutsier film-making than creating an animated war documentary. Israeli filmmaker Ari Folman's genre blend is exactly what makes ""Waltz with Bashir"" a stand-out film, one made with every intention of frightening producers in concept and spitting in Hollywood's face with its quality. The challenge of every war film is to illuminate a repetitive genre and ""Bashir"" does exactly that almost by approach alone.The film is best described as a narrative documentary told in the first person. Folman, who served in the Israel army during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, interviews friends and others who shared his same experience in hopes to jog his memory, images from his experience that he's subconsciously erased from his mind. It begins by addressing the fine line between memories and dreams, fiction and reality and evolves into a story of war's horrorsThe animation is a technique called animatics, where live action footage is shot in a studio to provide sound and an image for the artists to work with, then the artists animate these scenes and use computers to add in Flash techniques. It's a rough animation style but its infused with beauty from the computer, namely light and smoke techniques that go beyond traditional animation. ""Bashir"" has an allure all its own despite the tough story it tells.So why this technique? Folman's answer might just have been to be different, but the reality is it forces you to observe with a different perspective. Animating tragic events jades us to the horrors, allows us to ignore them. Contrast that to the perspectives of the people telling their war stories and suddenly we can sympathize with their own fragile memories, the reason so many soldiers stood idly as Christian Phalangists brutally massacred Palestinians in their own refugee camps no less.The use of Flash allows for some really interesting sequences in the film that depict these memories. Its supposed to be about the young soldier's perspective of war and so rock music and this '80s music video style at times contrasts other scenes showing what war was really like with the idealistic painting of 'cool' that some soldiers thought they were walking into. With every Israeli having to serve in the army, this is about coping regardless of one's opinion of war.Other than its insights into the war-torn memory, ""Bashir"" is a pretty standard exposure of war. What makes it special is there's no glorifying of war -- not even a single character who believes it to be that way -- and its one-of-a-kind medium. It's important to blur the boundaries of films when its appropriate and this revisiting of war proved to be one such setting.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"
148,Waltz with Bashir,8,15 August 2009,Excellent telling of the horrors of war,"Don't let the fact that this is animated fool you. There is nothing funny about this movie. It captures with complete accuracy the horror of war for soldiers and civilians alike. It could be Vietnam, Iraq, or in this case, Beriut in 1982.Based on true facts, how war brutalizes everyone and leaves no one a victor. How innocents are killed, soldiers stand by and watch and a race of people (the Jews) allow the same kind of senseless slaughter against the Palestines as the Nazis did to them in WW2.There are no bad guys, everyone shares equal blame. The soldiers and civilians are the ones who suffer during and long after the war. The animation is superb, it is almost as real as watching combat footage. The story is right from the headlines and the heart.I recommend this movie as an insight to the senselessness of war, the horror, the ultimate price paid by all."
149,Waltz with Bashir,8,9 August 2009,"A Dark, Gritty, Surreal Documentary About the Horrors of War","Waltz With Bashir grabs you from the first few seconds of the film. A pack of vicious, ravenous dogs run through the streets as people dodge out of the way of their snarling jaws. The dogs pay no attention to the people; they have only one thing on their mind, one mission, and it's a man. They want revenge. He killed all twenty-six of them during the war.This movie deals with post-traumatic stress disorder as seen in several different ""characters"" as one man, Ari, goes on a quest to rediscover the memories of the first Lebanon War that he has subconsciously made himself forget. He travels around the world, finding comrades from the war and asks them about their experiences, desperately trying to summon the dark memories he has forgotten for twenty years.It's not so much this particular war that the film focuses on, in fact similar documentaries or stories could be made from almost any war (but they haven't), but the focus is on how these men deal with what they've seen and done, and how it has affected them. One of the most interesting parts of the movie is when Ari's friend points out that in a way, what Ari saw and participated in is not so different from what the Nazis did to Jews during World War II (albeit on a smaller scale). As an Israeli, this obviously makes Ari feel extremely guilty and these horrible memories were pushed out of the forefront of his mind so he could avoid dealing with these painful emotions.The animation is fresh. If you are becoming somewhat bored by the perfectly smooth and brightly colored Pixar and Dreamworks movies, this will peak your interest. The colors are dull and muted in a good way. The lines are thick and black. It's gritty and dark and feels like watching a graphic novel in fluid motion.If you're in the mood for unique animation, a short history lesson, good sound, realistic animated action, and a deep dive into the minds of soldiers who have seen terrible things and share them, look no further. Waltz with Bashir is the best documentary I have seen in years."
150,Waltz with Bashir,9,1 August 2009,Surreal Soul-Searching,"This psychologically charged delving into a mind traumatized by the horrors of the 1982 Lebanon invasion is filled with unforgettable moments and may well be this millennium's first great movie on the atrocities of war.Never before - if ever - has animation been combined with a documentary approach in such a thoughtful fashion. The unpredictable mixture of captivating interviews and (auto-)biographical war anecdotes - even some funny ones - with surreal images originating from the depth of the subconscious results in an intriguing work of art that's both deeply personal and universal in its impact. No relief, no easy answers, just honest inconclusive soul-searching.9 out of 10 naked soldiers rising from the sea"
151,Waltz with Bashir,8,27 July 2009,"May Be Animated, But This Is No Cartoon","Ari Folman's animated documentary about the role he played in an Israeli massacre of Palestinians during the Lebanese war of the early 1980s.Folman has no recollection of the event, so he embarks on a journey to find other people who he knows were there and who might be able to help him reconstruct his memories. What unfolds is yet one more horrible chapter in the eternal saga of mankind's potential for brutality and hatred.""Waltz with Bashir"" is a deeply depressing film; Folman doesn't end the movie with any lessons learned, and there's no phony message of hope to serve as a ray of light amid the suffocating gloom. The last few minutes of the film are composed of actual footage of the aftermath of the massacre, and the final image of the film is the corpse of a little boy poking out from a pile of rubble. The entire Lebanese war as depicted by Folman was a study in senseless carnage, as indeed are most wars.One might think that animating the film would rob it of some of its visual power, but that's not the case. Folman is able to depict events visually that he wouldn't have been able to do otherwise if he'd had to rely on existing footage, and the result is that the film feels more brutal and disturbing than a more traditional documentary on the same subject probably would.Grade: A"
152,Waltz with Bashir,10,17 July 2009,Waltz with Bashir is an extraordinary piece of art,"The first thing which stands out in Waltz with Bashir is the animation which was used on its manufacture.It may not be very fluid or detailed from a technical point of view,but it perfectly helps to depict the memories,nightmares and ambiguous reality the main characters experiment.However,the most important thing in this extraordinary movie is not the technique which was used on the animation,but all the ideas which are expressed on the story,showing the human sight of a political moment whose historical importance darkens the effects it produced on a personal level to many people who were involved in the invasion to Lebanon.Waltz with Bashir offers us a personal and very emotive vision about the First War of Lebanon,analyzing it from a fascinating perspective which is usually ignored by the History books.The screenplay from this movie is very deep,because it does not only make a detailed analysis of that conflict,but it also explores philosophical subjects,like the fluid nature of memory and its validity on the emotional development of people.Because of its style,exotic atmosphere and balance between honest drama and unexpected touches of humor,Waltz with Bashir could be compared with the film Persepolis.And although I liked that film pretty much,I think Waltz with Bashir is very superior,because I found it to be more ambitious on its shape and more reflexive on its deepness.The brilliant idea of using animation for illustrating a semi-documentary story could be considered as many people to be a simple trick which alters the reality from the interviews.However,I admired that decision,because the vignettes finish waking up the imagination from the spectator,at the same time they add a lot of meaning to details which would go unnoticed.Finally,I have to give a very enthusiastic recommendation to Waltz with Bashir.This is one of those joys which remember us why the cinema is considered as an art,and it makes me very happy to see that movies like this still exist.In summary,a monumental film,which is absolutely worthy of all the acclamation it received."
