0,A Night at the Opera,,6 April 2005,Marx Bros. Masterpiece,"Though some claim that either HORSE FEATHERS OR DUCK SOUP was the greatest Marx Brothers opus, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA has to be Marxdom's signature film. The witticisms and riotous madcap from playwright George Kaufman (THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER; YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU) is evident everywhere in the some of the team's finest composition of wit and physical comedy.After taking over MGM studios in the 1930's, big-wig Irving Thallberg pulled the Marx Bros. aside and told them, ""You know, you guys are missing only one thing in your pictures: you never help anybody."" After OPERA, the Marx Brothers' scripts always revolved around either an attempt to get a romantic couple together or became an effort to save an institution from going under, i.e., THE BIG STORE; A DAY AT THE RACES; HORSE FEATHERS; THE BIG CIRCUS.Margaret Dumont is established once and for all as Groucho's perfect romantic staple and a Marx Bros. movie just doesn't seem right without her. Sig Rumond appears to have been created in a Marx Brothers comedy factory and serves sensationally as the urbane Marx antagonist vying for Dumont's favors, though upended time and time again by Groucho. A young Kitty Carlisle and Allen Jones provide the romance and music--though many audiences never realize how fine an operatic voice Carlisle had in those days.So many hilarious and classic routines fill A NIGHT AT THE OPERA that the movie offers itself as a study in Komedy 101: the unforgettable ""contract"" bit between Chico and Groucho (Chico can't read). As they try to sign an agreement about the rights to manage singer Allen Jones, they tear clause after clause off the paper until Chico finally asks: ""What's this?"" ""Oh,"" replies Groucho, ""that's just a sanity clause."" Chico bursts out laughing. ""Oh, you canna' fool me; there ain't' no sanity Klaus!..."" The crowded state room scene where Groucho, Chico, and Hapro stow-away in a tiny cubicle and the shoebox crams with more and more people until Mrs. Claypool (Dumont) opens the door and everyone spills out...The hotel scene where Detective Henderson tries to nail the brothers for stowing-away and everyone races back and forth between suites, furniture is switched, and Henderson is left wondering if he's nuts...But it is the film's finale during a live performance at the New York opera house that is perhaps the comedy team's grandest movie climax. The police, still after Harpo for stowing away, try to arrest him during a live performance. He breaks through the theater's backstage, swings over the proscenium like a trapeze artist, and, at one point, tears off the dress of one of the singers. ""Well, now we're finally getting somewhere!"" Groucho opines from the audience.What a shame A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is not on television more often. Young people should be treated to comedy as it once was when laughter depended upon uproarious wit and a brand of physical comedy perfected by comedians through years of refining their craft in vaudeville. A NIGHT AT THE OPERA is nothing less than an American comedy classic.Trivia: Maragaret Dumont appeared with Groucho on THE Hollywood PALACE television show in 1965 and the couple did a brief repartee from GROUCHO's famous Captain Spaulding routine. The next day Dumont passed away...Her last film was in 1964 in the star-studded WHAT A WAY TO GO...Always playing a haughty spinstress with money, Dumont was, in fact, a millionairess in real life and commuted between Hollywood and London....Few realize what a fine operatic singer Kitty Carlisle was in the 1930's. In the 1950's and '60's she was a regular panelist on television quiz shows such as I'VE GOT A SECRET...She was also married to playwright Moss Hart who collaborated with George Kaufman on YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER, and many other plays. YOU CAN'T won the Pulitzer Prize...Allen Jones was the father of popular singer Jack Jones...Groucho said that it was while hanging out of an airplane in A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA (1946) that he finally realized the brothers had pretty much reached the end of the line in movies...The last picture in which all three brothers appeared was THE STORY OF MANKIND in 1957. Groucho played the part of Sir Isaac Newton...Groucho wrote many books: MEMOIRS OF A MANGY LOVER and LETTERS FROM GROUCHO...Harpo Marx also wrote his own autobiography: HARPO SPEAKS--a fine expose of the brothers' early years and the many stage shows they did perfecting their mayhem...When the stock market crashed in 1929, Groucho lost every dime he had: about $250,000...In the 1950's Groucho hosted his own television quiz show,YOU BET YOUR LIFE and both Harpo and Chico made surprise appearances...Chico was a lifetime gambler and would bet on anything...MINNIE'S BOYS, a stage play about the influence of Marx mother Minnie, was pretty much a flop in the 1970's...One of the all-time great quotations about the Marx Brothers came from playwright George Kaufman who, after watching the comedy team tear apart his script on stage in the early years, observed: ""I could have sworn I just heard one of the original lines from the play.""...Groucho was self-conscious about his lack of formal education and once had the chance to meet poet T.S. Eliot. He read many of Eliot's works and boned up on literature. When the two men did finally meet, all Eliot wanted to talk about was A NIGHT AT THE OPERA...One of Groucho's final performances just before he died was at Carnegie Hall in New York and it was a smashing success. He was accompanied by pianist Marvin Hamlisch...Film critic James Agee once said that the worst thing the Marx Brothers ever did was still better than everybody else...Dennis Caracciolo"
1,A Night at the Opera,10,1 January 2007,"The best Marx Brothers film, the best comedy, the best everything","""A Night at the Opera"" is one of those films you can see dozens of times and laugh just as hard as you did the first time. The brothers get mixed up with an opera company and a divo and diva in love - Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle, and trying to get the two to perform together.The one-liners come so fast - you keep thinking you'll remember them, but one is funnier than the next. I do remember what Groucho says when he sees the gypsy Azucena in the opera, however. ""How would you like to feel how she looks?"" The stateroom scene is, of course, a classic, and my favorite part is when Groucho tells the housekeeper, ""I want two pillows on that bed"" and Harpo sound asleep and being moved everywhere, including onto a tray of food.But nothing beats the last half hour - the performance of ""Il Trovatore"" with Harpo using the stage ropes like Tarzan, and Chico playing baseball in the orchestra while Groucho sells peanuts. They have replaced part of the overture with ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game.""Allan Jones plays the tenor Ricardo Baroni who is hoping for his break. Why they cast the blond Jones as a tenor named Baroni - well, there you go. He sings very well and is quite handsome. Kitty Carlisle is the diva waiting, petite and pretty and singing music out of her vocal type, with the exception of ""Alone."" ""Stridono lassu"" and Leonora in Trovatore were both much too heavy for her. She does sing well and what a woman - she's still alive and recently performed at a New York supper club recently at the age of 95.The only problem with any Marx Brothers film is that when they aren't in front of the camera, suddenly their films become very slow. Because I was trained in opera and have some interest in it, this was less the case than with some of their other films. They were too magical, too energetic, and too darn funny to ever share a spotlight with anyone else. Thank goodness they did, though, as they left us with many treasures. This is one."
2,A Night at the Opera,,23 April 2002,A classic all the way!,"No doubt that ""A Night at the Opera"" is right up there with ""Duck Soup"" as the best Marx Brothers movie. Some Marx-purists complain ""ANatO"" is when the brothers started to grow soft and their quality started to decline. For one thing, instead of ridiculing romantic couples (the love story subplot plays a big part), they support them. Also, it's not as surreal or satirical as their past films. To those purists, I say: Lighten up! ""ANatO"" is just as funny as anything the Marx Bros did in the past (heck, I think it's funnier than ""Monkey Business""), and it's withstood the test of time perfectly. In fact, ""ANatO"" is said to be Groucho's favorite; he even called his previous films ""duds""! The film is filled with jabs at the upper class and double entendres courtesy of Groucho. Sample:Mrs. Claypool: Do you have everything, Otis?Otis: I haven't had any complaints yet!The love story subplot isn't as nauseating as 1937's ""A Day at the Races"". Allan Jones may be a bit too mushy, but Kitty Carlisle, the love interest, is cool and calm enough to help it go down easily (that's really her singing, by the way). Chico and Harpo have some inspired moments, such as their gleeful butchering of ""Il Travotore"" (sp?). The hapless villains are the funniest Marx foils ever, and the finale is just uproarious. ""ANatO"" is a wonderfully silly romp, and it's rather harmless, so kids can probably watch and enjoy it. The famous stateroom scene is nothing short of brilliant, and you'll find yourself humming along to ""Cosi Cosa"" (I just wish the ballad ""Alone"" had been left, well, alone). Don't miss this hilarious masterpiece. And now, on with the opera!!"
3,A Night at the Opera,,18 June 2001,Great Marx Brothers Entertainment,"""A Night at the Opera"" is great Marx Brothers entertainment.  It has comedy, music, and a good cast - everything except Zeppo, who by this time had left the act.  It fully deserves its reputation as one of the two best Marx Brothers films, along with ""Duck Soup"".""A Night at the Opera"" is probably slightly less funny than ""Duck Soup"" (it is no criticism to say that of any film), but it has more of a story to connect the great comic bits.  There is a good supporting cast in both films - here Sig Ruman is especially funny, in addition to the perennial Margaret Dumont.  It also has several fairly long musical interludes - some are operatic, but the most entertaining is Chico and Harpo's impromptu shipboard entertainment.Of course, the real attraction in any of these films is the comedy, and there are some memorable bits in this one.  The contract negotiations between Chico and Groucho, and the scene in Groucho's stateroom, are especially hilarious, and you have to see the stateroom scene more than once to catch everything.  And for sustained zany humor, the climactic sequence at the opera might be the funniest part of all.This is certainly a must for Marx Brothers fans."
4,A Night at the Opera,,30 May 2006,Phantoms of the Opera,"A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (MGM, 1935) directed by Sam Wood, re-introduces the Marx Brothers to the screen following their five years at the Paramount studio (1929-1933) to MGM, this being the start of a new beginning and the end to their wild world of comedy. It also brings forth their most popular comic foil of all, Margaret Dumont, from their Broadway to Paramount days, and the return to a formula story and time out for musical interludes either by the brothers or the romantic lovers originally done in their initial films of THE COCOANUTS (1929) and ANIMAL CRACKERS (1930). Aside from now being The Three Marx Brothers (Zeppo who has since retired), their characters have been toned down a bit, which helps. However, at MGM, with this, their best film for the studio, Groucho and Harpo become victims instead of instigators, with such notable scenes as Harpo employed as a dresser for an abusive opera tenor (Walter Wolfe King) who slaps, hits and uses a whip on him (at one point off camera) whenever getting out of line with his buffoonery, and Groucho, who always wins out in every situation physically and verbally, getting kicked down four flights of stairs, which indicates they are not always indestructible, yet remain in character from the old days whenever possible. Chico retains his wiseacre Italian character, remaining notably the same from his previous efforts, however, things will start to change not for the better for him and his brothers in the movies to follow.Plot summary: Introduction takes place in Milan, Italy, where Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) agrees to represent dowager Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) into society by arranging for her to invest $200,000 to Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman), director of the opera company so that he can afford to bring opera singers Rudolpho Lassparri (Walter King) and Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle) to New York City. Rudolpho loves Rosa, but she is more interested in Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones), an unknown singer working as a chorus-man, but with the help of Fiorelli (Chico), acting as his manager, and his partner, Tomasso (Harpo), the trio head for America by becoming stowaways on the S.S. Americus, hiding out in Driftwood's tiny stateroom in order for Ricardo to get his big chance as a singer. After Driftwood and his cronies arrive in at the Metropolitan Opera House, thanks to them in disrupting Rudolpho's performance that the art of opera will never be the same again.The musical program: ""Alone"" (sung by Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones) by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed; ""Cosi-Cosa"" (sung by Allan Jones) by Bronislau Kaper, Walter Jurmann and Ned Washington; ""All I Do is Dream of You"" (by Brown and Freed/piano solo by Chico Marx); ""Alone"" (harp solo by Harpo Marx); and selections from Il Trovatore by Guiseppi Verdi: ""Di quella pira,"" ""Miserere,"" ""Anvil Chorus,"" ""Stride la Vampa"" ""Strido lassu"" and ""Miserere."" Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle doing their duet, ""Alone,"" him on the pear and she from the boat dock, Chico's fast finger piano playing, and Harpo's harp solo in a serious manner as he performs to a little old lady (facial shadow front only) who looks on approvingly, may not be highlights, but are truly memorable moments.Highlights: Whenever anyone goes into discussion regarding A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, the first thing that comes immediately to mind is that famous state room scene involving Groucho, Chico and the sleeping Harpo, with various others involved, crammed together until the door opens, having them all falling out like dominoes. This hilarious bit is one that's remembered best with fondness and admiration. However, there are others worth noting: The opening where Dumont awaits for Groucho at a restaurant for an hour only to find him at the table behind her eating with another lady, is priceless; Groucho and Chico contract exchanges that becomes a ""sanity clause""; arrested stowaway Harpo's attempt in escaping his detention cabin by crawling out of a porthole and hanging onto a rope outside only to be dumped into the ocean; Jones, Chico and Harpo in bearded disguises posing as celebrity aviators to give speeches on coast-to-coast radio, with the silent Harpo covering up his muteness by constantly drinking glasses of water; the disappearance of beds in Groucho's hotel room while the plainclothesman detective (Robert Emmett O'Connor) investigates; and of course, the climactic opera chaos by the Marxes, with one great bit with the orchestra playing the overture to ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" after coming to the page with the planted song sheets, with Groucho acting as a vendor yelling ""Peanuts! Peanuts!"" to the patrons. A classic with Callas.The supporting players: Newcomer Allan Jones steps in for the role that might have been offered to Zeppo. He is a likable actor with a fine singing voice who performs well opposite Kitty Carlisle (another recruit from Paramount and rare screen appearance, being best known as the TV panelist in the long running quiz show, ""To Tell the Truth"").Footnote: It is quite evident that prints that have been circulating since commercial television days isn't complete. Missing footage is quite evident during the opening minutes of the story where the movie originally began with a musical number prior to the restaurant scene involving Groucho and Dumont. At present, this, along with other cut footage, no longer exists. Timed at 96minutes, the 90 minute version is the one available on Turner Classic Movies, VHS and DVD formats. Maybe one of these years a completely restored print of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA will suffice, but for now, this will have to do.In closing: Get out those opera glasses and have yourself a grand night at the opera. (***1/2)"
5,A Night at the Opera,8,21 October 2006,I Appreciate This One Now!,"I didn't fully appreciate this film until my second viewing. Now I think it's one of the better Marx Brothers film. The film - filled with funny lines - has all the familiar MB trappings: good slapstick, good and bad jokes and routines, wild scenes, several musical numbers and general overall chaos.The only thing not appealing to me in the film were some of the songs - not all, just some. Otherwise, it was all fun as Groucho, Chico and Harpo all share humorous lines and/or sight gags. Kitty Carlisle doesn't offer much in the way of a young beauty but it was still interesting to see her at this age as I had only known her through her ""To Tell The Truth"" television days. Alan Jones, meanwhile, is a pleasing singer and a nice guy, as always.This is the film with the famous scene involving a ton of people being stuffed into Groucho's small cabin room. It's more amazing than funny. My favorite scenes were when Groucho and Chico got into discussions and trade lines back-and- forth. I also laughed heartily at the finale with Harpo swinging like Tarzan at the opera house.In all, a funny MB film, one of the boys' better efforts. I play it with the English subtitles so as not to miss any of the great lines of dialog in here."
6,A Night at the Opera,,1 August 1998,The Marx Brothers against the world,"This is probably the best Marx Brothers film. It is certainly my favorite. The brothers destroy pomposity and pretension by the ton. The pieces of comic business were worked out through many live theater performances before the scenes were finally filmed. This craftsmanship never shows, but it pays off completely. The stateroom scene is a classic, and the total devastation of the opera is a delicious piece of craziness."
7,A Night at the Opera,7,17 November 2013,Relentlessly hilarious and outrageous musical  comedy that still works very  well,"Amusing and entertaining Marx picture , it has a lot of funny material and unfortunately intrusive songs . Groucho's wisecracks and the incomparable Chico and Harpo carry the movie . It deals with a sly business manager named Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) and two (Chico Marx as Fiorello and Harpo Marx as Tomasso) wacky friends of two (Kitty Carlisle as Rosa and Allan Jones as Ricardo) opera singers help them achieve success while humiliating their stuffy and snobbish enemies . Later on , Marx Brothers anarchize the opera , insulting and mocking the guests and players . Their actions include some on stage antics during the stage debut , as they arrange for the normal tenor to be absent so that the young lover named Ricardo can get his chance . Classic Marx film with many funny sequences , this is the most sustained bit of insanity , full of crazy gags , antics and amusement , being now deemed a satiric masterpiece ,and one of the biggest hits . Although it suffers from staginess and musical comedy plotting but gives the zany threesome plenty of comic elaboration . Enough gags for give several movies , but our favorite is still the cabin scene . Despite the abundant songs and silly as well as sappy love story the movie maintains itself very well . This is a fun comedy as hilariously amusing as the films they made at Paramount with Zeppo . This is a M.G.M production lavishly financed by Irving Thalberg . Excellent Harpo Marx , as usual , he even did many of his own stunts , he later said it was a silly thing for a 47-year-old non-stuntman to have done . Groucho said that this was his favorite among his movies . The Marx Bros (minus Zeppo) are in peak form in this vintage musical comedy with co-star the legendary Margaret Dumont , including sparkling dialogs with Groucho . Furthermore , Sig Ruman makes his first of three appearances in The Marx Brothers films. However , this is the first Marx Brothers film made without brother Zeppo Marx, it started a new trend of The Marx Brothers movies featuring a Zeppo-like supporting character who carries the love story and sings the song . The motion picture was well directed by Sam Wood . Sam Wood, freshman The Marx Brothers director in this film, was a perfectionist , the scene in which Harpo Marx hangs from the rope was filmed so many times that Harpo Marx's hands became cut and swollen from the rope . Don't miss it , one of the funniest picture ever made by Marx BrothersOther important films starred by Marx Brothers -many of them Broadway farce plays transfered by scenarists into vehicle for the Brothres- , they are the followings : ¨Animal crackers¨, ¨Duck soap¨ that was a flop when first released but today considered a masterpiece , ¨Horse Feathers¨, ¨At the circus¨, ¨Day at the races¨ , ¨Room service¨ , ¨Go West¨, ¨Love Happy¨ and ¨Night in Casablanca¨, though in 1946 the Marx formula was wearing thin . Any film with Groucho , Chico , Harpo and Zeppo is well worth seeing ."
8,A Night at the Opera,10,8 August 2006,"Along with ""Duck Soup"" this is the Marx Brothers best movie","Classic comedy involving Otis P. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) trying to get Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) into high society--and romancing her to get her money. He figures opera is the best way and gets involved with Chico, Harpo and rising opera singers Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle) and Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones).The plot doesn't really matter too much--it's just a jumping off point for the Marx Brothers to stage one hysterical scene after another. The jokes fly fast and furious and there are quite a few standout scenes: Chico and Groucho negotiating a contract; the infamous stateroom scene; Harpo, Chico and Jones impersonating three airmen; the brothers fooling a policeman by switching furniture from room to room and the total destruction of the opera ""Il Travatore"" at the end.This is also one of the few Marx Brothers movies that's not destroyed by an unnecessary romance or lousy sings. Carlisle and Jones make an engaging couple and the two big songs--""Cosi Cosa"" and ""Alone""--are actually pretty good. ""Alone"" actually became a big hit back when this movie was released. The only bad points here are Chico and Harpos obligatory piano and harp solos--but those are small points in the whole movie.I'm really surprised this isn't in IMDb's top 100 movies--this is a true comedy classic. A 10 all the way."
9,A Night at the Opera,10,18 March 2009,one of those timeless crowd-pleasing comedies; a Marx brothers hit on many levels,"A Night at the Opera is comedy that still hits about as out of the park as imaginable as a true entertainment vehicle. There's comedy, there's music, there's musical numbers, there's action, there's drama, there's romance, there's even fake beards and ""Take me out the Ballgame"" performed in an opera house ""by accident"" of course. It also gives a showcase for its main three jovial anarchists (Groucho, Harpo and Chico) as smashing as its production; it's a million dollars well spent, and when you aren't laughing you're at least smiling or enjoying a melodic tune or some good opera melodies. Whether or not it hits so strongly that it might top the quintessential Marx flick, Duck Soup, can be arguable for as long as one can type keys or stretch vocal chords. There's good arguments on either side, and while I myself might be inclined to say that Duck Soup is the ""best film"" of the Marxs, Night at the Opera might be as, if not more, plain fun.And it's so unforgettable, with scene after moment after continuous gag that goes so far along that it becomes funny just seeing how long these guys can keep going. There's a scene mid-way through A Night at the Opera that might be just about perfect: Groucho has his tiny room. At first the gag is simply that the room is almost too small to even fit the luggage case he has (also fitting inside Chico, Harpo and the conventional leading-man opera singer stowaway). Groucho orders breakfast- an amazing and wonderfully long gag involving an order of hard-boiled eggs- and then the maids come in, and then others come in, and then more come in, and lines like ""You know I had a premonition you were going to show up. The engineers right there in the corner. You can chop your way right through."" Harpo is still asleep, of course, trying to cure his insomnia by sleeping on top of everybody else shuffling around... it all builds so much that it's like its own piece of frantic, combustible music, and it's one of those pure scenes in movies that one can never really top, only try and imitate and get OK in their own right.There are others that strike up such strong laughs, exchanges of dialog that go on like verbal assaults in the form of an argument over a contract between Groucho and Chico (""Sanity clause"" ""I don't believe in it!""), or just the continuous string of syncopated insults and throwaway lines from Groucho that cut right to the matter and even find some new twists one would never think of outside of his mind. But it's not all just raucous and crazy behavior from the stars; there's also the opera itself, that big long sequence where the ""plan"" is unfolded and ""WAR"" is unleashed upon the production (my favorite is the bit where the various set pieces on stage keep falling down behind the singer, at one point falling right in front him), and a kind of sweetness that pops up often that keeps it from being too, uh... insane, like say Duck Soup could arguably be called.Insanity, of course, is what the Marx's excel at, an organized chaos of comedy that is so seamless because of how energized and random some of the things happen with- but there is logic, as warped as it can be, like the other classic number when the brothers and opera singer carry out the beds one by one around the window or through the door evading the totally perplexed eyes of the officer. There's such a kind of graceful choreography to this that is slipped under the veneer or complete WHAT! moments that keep these movies so fresh so very long after. And it's a sweet movie too; a movie may be criticized for taking an extended break from the story, however loose it may be, and Night at the Opera can have that against it. But the break it takes, with the big musical number and dance and Chico and Harpo's playing on the piano and latter on the harp, is so touching and fun and inventive. You'll be smiling and just wrapped up in the childlike awe of these moments as opposed to grumbling and wondering ""where's the story?"" Story? Marx don't need no stinking story! Between the three brothers, and on occasion even the slightly weaker but still crucial ""normal"" plot line with the love between the talented amateur singer and the star played by Carlisle, there's enough material at times for two movies. The real joy of Night at the Opera, and it happens often, is seeing these three guys go to work at the best of what they do: Groucho's remarks and verbal intelligence (or just damn bravery), Chico's slightly dim but well-meaning immigrant type, and Harpo as... Harpo, damn it, he doesn't need to be explained (well, maybe the water bit is a little strange, but par for the course). It's joyful and hilarious cinema on parade, even better on a big screen, albeit the noticeable random jump cuts are annoying in any format."
10,A Night at the Opera,10,14 July 2008,Ironically the most memorable film about opera ever made!,"The Marx Brothers were set adrift by Paramount in 1933 after making arguably their best satiric comedy DUCK SOUP. For two years they rarely worked together (an exception was a briefly heard radio show called FLYWHEEL, SHYSTER, AND FLYWHEEL about crooked lawyers which had Groucho and Chico - unfortunately, like their silent film HUMORISK, the recordings of the show no longer exist*). Zeppo left the team, to pursue a career as a movie agent. Chico and Harpo did some band touring.[*The scrips have survived, and been published.] Then Chico made a valuable contact - he played cards with Irving Thalberg, who was almost as powerful a figure at MGM as Louis B. Mayer. Thalberg decided to sign the brothers to a contract where he'd be their producer. The contract was a unique one - it promised the brothers a percentage of the gross of the first two films, which was a rarity in Hollywood acting contracts. The contract also enabled the brothers to perform their material from the film live on stage. This enabled them to hone material as they did in vaudeville and on Broadway. They were lucky in the writers for this first film (George S. Kaufman, Morris Ryskine, and Al Boasberg). And they had a good cast, including their old ""female"" Marx Brother Margaret Dumont.A NIGHT AT THE OPERA has (since it appeared in 1935) been accepted as one of the best Marx vehicles, and ties with DUCK SOUP as their supreme work. It's detractors say that it had too many points that would bring down the Brothers later films after A DAY AT THE RACES, such as the love story that is tied to the plot and the fact that the brothers are frequently brought to a low point from which to rise with all their power against their opponents. The latter seemed to ""humanize"" them too much. Actually the love stories had been part of their movies since THE COCONUTS, and in HORSE FEATHERS and DUCK SOUP the villains did momentarily trounce the brothers. As for humanizing the brothers, their antics at the opera here and the race track in A DAY AT THE RACES are so devious and strenuous you find them comic supermen in both films. It is the tragedy of the post 1938 years (after ROOM SERVICE) that Mayer simply did not care to help them as Thalberg had done.The plot of the film is how Otis P. Driftwood (Groucho), an agent for Mrs. Claypool (Dumont) (trying to make a splash in society) arranges to have her meet Herman Gottlieb (Ruman), the head of the Metropolitan Opera, while they are in Italy. Ruman is willing to have Dumont finance the season of the Met, and is trying to sign up one Rodolfo Lasspari (Walter Woolf King) as his new tenor. King is a good tenor, but an egotist and bully, constantly beating his servant Tomasso (Harpo). He has been trying to get his soprano Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle) to take an interest in him on a social basis. But Rosa is in love with a junior tenor in the chorus, Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones). Ricardo's friend Fiorello (Chico) is his agent, and manages to hoodwink Driftwood into contracting to get Ricardo to be the lead tenor at the Met, while Gottlieb manages to get a contract with Lasspari. The plot follows how the characters get to America by ocean liner (Ricardo, Fiorello, and Tomasso as stowaways), how the stowaways and Driftwood run afoul of the law by a public hoax, how Driftwood and Rosa both lose their positions at the Opera, and how the Marxes get their revenge on Gottlieb, the New York Police, and Lasspari in the concluding twenty minutes of the film. Pauline Kael once described the conclusion as: ""The Brothers do to IL TROVATORI what should be done to Il TROVATORI."" It is a worthy target as far as popular operas go. Verdi's music is wonderful as ever in that opera, but the storyline is so complicated and ridiculous (about a missing nobleman's son, and the rivalry of the surviving son with a gypsy for the love of the heroine) that people tend not to consider it among their favorite Verdi operas (not like, say AIDA or RIGOLETTO). It's improbable plot involving stolen children and gypsies is shown for what it is when (in demolishing the production) Harpo causes various backdrops to rise and fall, including a pushcart on an American street and a battleship's gun turret to fall behind the gypsy woman's campfire! You just cannot take it seriously.The conclusion is wonderful, but so is the double talk of the contract negotiations between Groucho and Chico (later repeated with Ruman), the great stateroom sequence (written by Al Boasberg), the City Hall greeting by the Mayor to the three Russian aviators, and the wonderful almost surreal sequence where Police Sgt. Hennesey (Robert Emmett O'Connor) goes between two rooms and a fire escape to find beds flying from one to another, and to find an old woman and a man with a strange beard and mustache reading a paper at the end (Harpo and Groucho - Chico pretending to be a chair underneath Harpo)- believing he has managed to enter the wrong apartment! The singing by all three leads (King also had a decent voice) is fine, with Jones and Carlisle given a first rate tune (""Alone"") for their duet in the departure sequence. Jones has a decent follow-up with ""Cosi, Cosa"", turned into a major production with Harpo, Chico, and the ""immigrant"" passengers singing and dancing to it. A NIGHT AT THE OPERA remains a first rate comic masterpiece, and a fine addition to the Marx Brothers' work in general."
11,A Night at the Opera,8,6 February 2006,awfully good but too much singing,"This film is the first and probably the best Marx Brothers film made by MGM. Unlike later MGM/Marx collaborations, this film has energy and creativity. However, it also has LOTS of singing--hence, the title of the movie. That means in addition to the usual Chico and Harpo songs, there is a lot of operatic-type stuff from the duo of Jones and Carlisle. For me, these songs were frankly the low-point of the picture, but for some dumb reason, Hollywood's conventional wisdom was that comedies MUST have musical numbers to be appreciated by wider audiences. This same formula was foisted upon WC Fields, Abbott and Costello and even Laurel and Hardy. However, this movie is th rare exception that is STILL good in spite of the pointless songs."
12,A Night at the Opera,8,1 February 2010,"Of What I've Seen, My Favorite 1930s Comedy","""In A Night At the Opera, the Marx brothers help two young lovers to succeed in love as well as in the opera world."" That's the most bare of plots. And, in fact, the joy of this film does not come with the plot, but with the numerous off-track happenings. Thank you, Marx Brothers.The Marx Brothers, particularly Groucho, are amazing at verbal and barbed comedy. The puns and jabs are almost non-stop, and they are so quick they might not even sink in until moments later. Some might be dated (like a reference to the Canadian quintuplets) but for the most part this film stands firm. I loved the ""sanity clause"" remark and many others.The most notable scene involves a large number of people packed into a small room, and was partially written by Buster Keaton. I do not know how much Keaton and the Marxes worked together over all, but if this was any indication, they should have continued. Keaton's physical comedy is evident, and Groucho's running commentary is wonderful.One of the most mysterious influences this film had on others is probably with Rob Zombie. He has written characters named ""Otis B. Driftwood"" and ""Captain Spaulding"" in homage to the Marx Brothers, and has other references, as well. It's pretty bizarre to connect this fun, sarcastic comedy to a bloodbath... but, then, stranger things have happened.I recommend this film to anyone. As far as early comedies go, Chaplin and Keaton are good, but I think the Marx Brothers really take the cake. Their memory has faded over the years, but this is most unfortunate... the humor is no less magical today."
13,A Night at the Opera,7,18 March 2009,Skip Past the Maudlin Interruptions to the Funny Bits.,"In this, the first Marx brothers picture to feature only Groucho, Chico and Harpo, the trio helps (?) two young lovers to flourish in love and in the opera world, preferably in a different order. Actually, preferably one without the other. Groucho, playing, Otis B. Driftwood, is hired by a forlorn upper-class aspirer to help her break into aristocratic society, but he favors to charm and insult her off and on. At the last opera performance of the season in Italy, of Pagliacci, Groucho meets Chico, who is the best friend and manager of an opera singer who yearns for his big break and who is in love with peer opera singer Kitty Carlisle. However, his dreams are overtaken by the star of the opera, Lassparri, a vainglorious bore who wants notoriety and Kitty Carlisle both for himself. Groucho signs the longing young singer to a contract, thinking he is signing Lassparri, who in the meantime is signed for the New York opera by a pompous entrepreneur. It could might be the best bit in the movie: Chico says in his embellished Italian accent, ""Hey, wait, wait. What does this say here, this thing here?"" Groucho: ""Oh, that? Oh, that's the usual clause, that's in every contract. That just says, uh, if any of the parties participating in this contract are not in their right mind, the entire agreement is automatically nullified."" ""Well, I don't know..."" ""It's all right. That's, in every contract. That's what they call a sanity clause."" ""Ha! You can't fool me. There ain't no Sanity Clause!""Although Chico and his client are not allowed to follow the ensemble to New York, they stow away on the ship, along with Harpo, a dresser fired by Lassparri. Once in New York, the stowaways are chased by the police as illegal aliens, and it all leads to a climactic comeuppance for all the stuffed shirts when the Marx brothers wreck the opening night performance of Il Trovatore by hurtling it into complete anarchy and making a last-chance shot for both of the idealistic young lovers to be the new hits of the opera world.Yes, the picture is indeed fun, but allow me to slaughter a sacred cow here and say that it's deeply weakened by all that schmaltzy Metro-Goldwyn-Mayerism. The Marx brothers were ultimately an anti-authoritarian presence that let off a lot of steam with shock value, warrantless aggravation, mean-spiritedness and pranks. Early studio-era MGM never did seem to understand that spectacle, romance and song-and-dance are indeed a curse to some films. Forgive me. I know how many purist toes I might've just stomped, but I have to be honest here, or there's no point in me writing this. Am I really the only one who fast- forwards over the maudlin interruptions to essentially pare it down simply to the hard-boiled eggs, the stateroom scene, Sanity Clause and the actual sabotaging of the opera? Duck Soup, on the other hand, is hilarious from beginning to end."
14,A Night at the Opera,9,31 July 2008,Perhaps the best the Marx Brothers ever accomplished.,"Don't get me wrong, Duck Soup is absolutely hilarious and features some great political satire, but I think A Night at the Opera reigns supreme as the best the Marx Brothers ever did. Perhaps the reason is that they finally got a polished and logical script with an actual realistic story combined with some likable characters and incredibly funny comic bits. From Animal Crackers to Duck Soup, the Marx's years at Paramount seemed more about just being zany and ridiculous and goofy. And while they all were funny in their own right, I thought only Animal Crackers and Duck Soup could be called truly great. The others just weren't as cohesive as they could have been, thus making the humor not as consistent.To be frank, this has to be the funniest the Marx Brothers ever were. Groucho plays his most sublime and offensive character yet with some of the best one-liners written for him yet. Harpo and Chico also are very good as two stowaways trying to help a young man become a famous singer and reunite with his opera lover. The only complaint I have is that there are some parts with too much singing that could have been cut out. More Groucho never hurt a movie, but this is still very funny all the time. A classic in its own right."
15,A Night at the Opera,10,23 September 2007,Two hard-boiled eggs and other great marxisms,"This time the Marx brothers make fun of the high culture.They step into the world of opera and no one can stop them.A Night at the Opera (1935) is directed by Sam Wood and George S.Kaufman is behind the screenplay.In this movie the Marx brothers collaborated with the producer Irving Thalberg for the first time.This is the first Marx movie without Zeppo in it.He retired after Duck Soup (1933).A farce can't get too much better than this.Oh what a riot they cause at the opera house.There's Harpo behaving like Tarzan and dressed all funny with Chico.They also do ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"".It's awfully funny when that small stateroom in the ship is packed with people.Then there's the contract-tearing scene between Groucho and Chico.Party of the first part of the...Hilarious! And Chico saying ""There ain't no sanity clause.""Brilliant! With the Marx brothers we of course have the brilliant Margaret Dumont playing Mrs.Claypool.The recently passed away Kitty Carlisle is Rosa Castaldi.Allan Jones (replacing Zeppo) is her sweetheart Ricardo Baroni.Sig Ruman and his beard is Herbert Gottlieb.Walter Woolf King is the villain Lassparri.This is a truly recommended comic masterpiece.The anarchy rules when the Marx brothers are in control."
16,A Night at the Opera,10,25 July 2006,Harpo the Important Ingrediant,"This movie has been analyzed for the last 70 years. Still alive is Kitty Carlisle Hart, who plays Rosa. She had the chance to sing opera, and she pulls it off admirably. (She married Moss Hart, who was associated with George Kaufman, who wrote this and other Marx comedies. YOU do the math!) Why isn't SHE on the commentary track for this film on DVD? Leonard Maltin is OK, but even HE doesn't know that ""Frenchy"" Marx, the father of the Marx Brothers, is seen sitting on the dock, waving at the ship, in ""Monkey Business"", NOT ""Night At The Opera"".Allan Jones fills in Zeppos shoes, with a fine singing voice, and a likable personality. Groucho's lines, classic or not, and Chicko's piano playing, unrivalled, and who is responsible for giving us Mel Torme, nevertheless could have been done by ANY leading film comedian; it is Harpo Marx that makes this, or any Marx Brothers movie, distinguishable from other movies by other comedy teams. How could a screenwriter write for Harpo? How much is his contribution, and how much the suggestion of the screenwriter or director? My guess? NONE. His expression as he passes along the buffet, as food upon food is piled up on him, is classic. It is honest. His playing with the kids on the piano, and his playing to the old Italian woman, touching her cheek at the end of Alone, speaks VOLUMES about Harpo. His scenes playing the harp are extraordinary. Look at his face! His whole demeanor changes. He wrote in Harpo Speaks that there are two Harpos. The crazy one. And the one playing harp. The one playing harp represents the real Harpo Marx. Look at the pancake scene. Groucho is almost laughing out loud at Harpo's antics! Alan Jones is laughing out loud! How many takes it took to film these scenes without the crew being heard laughing is anyone's guess. My guess is they had to really bite their lips. Groucho's wise cracks may have been equalled by any, Chicko's dialect, ditto. But Harpo? Maybe Chaplin came close, but he had no equal EVER!"
17,A Night at the Opera,9,20 June 2006,My favorite Marx Brothers Film,"""A Night At The Opera"" is my personal favorite Marx Brothers flick, barely edging ""Duck Soup"", and ""Horsefeathers"". It's so good that not even the obligatory romantic couple can ruin it. Although Allen Jones and Kitty Carlisle are really a cut above most of the cute, cuddly distractions. Nearly every scene is a gem, Groucho and Chico haggling over the world's greatest tenor's contract, the stateroom overflow, the ring around the rosie as Hennesy, the cop, tries to find the other brothers in Groucho's hotel room and the climactic opera, featuring Groucho's welcoming speech, ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"", Harpo's journey through the stage and scenery, and the authorities clumsy attempts to catch the brothers. Still hilarious, featuring the usual hectoring of the long suffering, but still dignified Margaret Dumont, the popping of the pompous Gottlieb (Sig Ruman) and the final comeuppance of the snooty Lassparri (Walter Wolf)."
18,A Night at the Opera,10,12 October 2004,It's my favorite...and this is why.,"This is my favorite movie for many reasons... This movie, I believe, is the climax of the Marx Brothers talents. Groucho's witty humor gets me every time and Chico and Harpo make the perfect team for humor. The music is breathtaking and, unlike another reviewer, I believe plays a crucial part of the movie, since they are dealing with an opera. Another note, that same reviewer stated that many bits were reused jokes from their earlier film ""Monkey Business"". This is true, but ""A Night at the Opera"" was made through MGM, where as ""Monkey Business"" was created at Paramount, I believe. This movie, in its release, had a much broader viewing audience. On a more personal note, I have heard statements that the humor doesn't transcend generations, and that is comepletely false. I am 19 and have grown up watching the Marx Brothers, and had worries showing the DVD of ""A Night at the Opera"" (Which, I swear, was the first person in Minnesota to buy)but they caught the humor and have borrowed it numerous times."
19,A Night at the Opera,10,4 June 2006,The last best hope...,"This is the finest single comedy in the history of American film (barring outright satire and baldfaced slapstick). That is, this is the ""everyman's"" comedy of American film. If you can't find something to laugh about here, visit a psychiatrist, you've really got a problem.On a more serious note, I must admit that the long pauses that were interjected into the film to accommodate audience laughter grow less and less tolerable over time, and it would be worth something to have these removed for a limited special edition release.Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.Other comedians could parody Hitler; only the Marxes could parody war (Duck Soup) and then swing around and, by parodying opera (Night at the Opera), remind us that the grand scheme of monsters doesn't amount to much compared to a sweet melody, a colorful dance, or the wink of a lover.Without ever performing a scene from Shakespeare, the Marx Bros. brought the Bard's humor up to date."
20,A Night at the Opera,7,23 May 2001,I don't know...,"This one I did not find all that great. Personally, I absolutely love Duck Soup, but I was unimpressed with A Night at the Opera. It was funny enough, sure, but, when I watch a movie by the same talent who created Duck Soup, I expect something that'll almost kill me with laughter. This film is often hilarious, especially at its beginning, but it suffers from long dry spells, some boring musical numbers (unlike the fantastic ones in Duck Soup), and a couple of set pieces which I just did not find as funny as the Marx Brothers may have wanted me to. Specifically, the hotel sequence. Harpo's breakfast was funny, but the whole avoiding the police officer thing I disliked. Also, the end setpiece with all three brothers being pursued around a stage while an opera was occurring was funny at first, but grew old in its persistence. I still liked the film, but I'm only giving it a 7/10."
21,A Night at the Opera,10,19 January 2010,Best of the Marxes,"Even thought he funniest Marx Bros. movie was Duck Soup, A Night at the Opera was the best made of the movies. Many people consider this to be the 2nd greatest, but I say this was the best. The story was good, but the comedy was hilarious. The music is pretty good too. The brothers were all very funny. The story involves opera stars making their debut in America. Is that all? No. When the Marxes are involved, there is more to it than that. The comedy scenes were hilarious but the best scenes were the states room and the clause scene. Anyway, Groucho plays a woman's financial adviser(Dumont) and she donates money to the opera manager (Ruman)Then you have two young lovers(Carlise and Jones) but cannot be together because she is being sent to America. Harpo and Chico are partners as usual, and the story goes on from there."
22,A Night at the Opera,10,19 September 2009,I love it. Love it.,"Maybe I'm biased because it's the first Marx Brothers film I ever saw, but this remains my favourite of theirs, and one of my favourite films of all. One thing that strikes me about it is it's not only funny, but FUN! To share just one example, when Groucho's looking out of the ship's porthole, trying to pull Harpo in as he's hanging from a rope, he says, ""You're alright, but the boat's too far away!"" It's just a happy, gleeful moment. And the music. All the music is wonderful. The songs are lovely, and Allen sings beautifully, although I don't care much of Carlisle's voice. She just wasn't very good. And I can never get enough of Chico's incredible piano playing - I dream of being able to play like that - while Harpo's harping is lovely. ""Duck Soup"" is up there as one of their best, but for me, ""A Night At The Opera"" will always be number one. I love it with a passion."
23,A Night at the Opera,8,2 October 2008,Not familiar with Marx movies? Try this one.,"I must admit that I am very light in personal knowledge of MArx Brothers films,and aside from the general information,imagery and quotes(the majority of which came from the irrepressible Groucho)that have been used and attributed in Western culture over the last seventy or eighty odd years,I have a very scant referential knowledge of their legendary body of film work.With that in mind,when I saw the public library had a copy of this film in its stacks,it was a no-brainer for me. And it was a largely pleasing film experience as well.The storyline seems to be somewhat insignificant: Brothers MArx are scattered about the goings on at a Venetian Opera company as it moves from Europe to New York City. They conspire to break a humble but talented tenor into the main role of the traveling show,as he is mooning over the young ingénue(Kitty Carlisle Hart,WELL before becoming the grand dame of TV Panel game shows!). But aside from the fair amount of music(hey,this IS,after all set in an Opera,so it goes to reason),this is mostly a physical comedy,laced with plenty of Groucho's standard one-liners. From watching his dealings with various straight people,from old stand-by MArgaret Dumont as his society-climbing wife,to the various lugs who signify authority(Theater directors,producers,society bigwigs,ship crew,policemen,local magistrates,etc.),Groucho is not only able to keep the humor legendarily fast and loose but also keeps the tempo of the dialog from bogging(I even noticed a sort of inspiration the creators at WArner Brothers got for Bugs Bunny from Groucho's witticisms!). Maybe not the best of the Marxes films--though I still don't have a real gauge of opinion on this yet--but it's a fantastic starter film to build familiarity."
24,A Night at the Opera,10,9 August 2008,The funniest movie of all time,"I have never found so much to laugh at in a movie before. All of the gags in this film are totally ridiculous and over-the-top. The Marx Brothers are the funniest people who ever lived. Groucho comes up with the most hilarious and unpredictable things to say, as does Chico. I always worry I'll start to memorize too many of the lines and won't laugh as much next time, but there are always too many great quotes and I still enjoy the film with each viewing. Harpo is also hysterical in his pantomime act and manages to convey more in a few gestures than most people can say in many words. Although most people prefer ""Duck Soup"" to this film, ""A Night at the Opera"" is the funniest in my opinion. In this film the laughs built more and more until the climactic ending, providing to be the funniest in film history. Perhaps the funniest thing in this film is watching and listening to Groucho insult those in high society. I won't give away any of the film's humor, but see it for sure. Way better than any of the crude and annoying humor found in today's comedies. See it and truly laugh for the first time.**** out of ****"
25,A Night at the Opera,9,25 November 2007,"""Let Joy Be Unconfined""","A Night At the Opera is the first film that three Marx Brothers did at MGM after leaving Paramount. Zeppo, who's contributions to the team are pretty negligible, decided not to make the trip. Nothing was lost and a lot was gained because Allan Jones assumed a Zeppo like character with a lot more personality and a great singing voice. With the story set at an opera company you would hope that a great voice would be a minimal requirement. In fact we have a bunch of great voices, not only Allan Jones, but Kitty Carlisle, and even egotistical tenor Walter Woolf King.The plot such as it is concerns the three brothers trying to get talented singer Allan Jones a break at the opera company. They're operating on many fronts here and that includes Groucho wooing the New York Opera Company's grande dame, Margaret Dumont. Harpo and Chico in the meantime become the bane of the existence for opera director Sig Ruman and Walter Woolf King. I'm always amazed that Groucho, the king of one liners and innuendo, is constantly exasperated and occasionally defeated by Chico who baffles him with non sequiters and ignorance. Case in point their 'negotiation' over Allan Jones's contract and the fact that poor Groucho thinks he's signing star Walter Woolf King. Chico knows better than anyone there's no such thing as a sanity clause.Allan Jones gets to sing two famous numbers identified with him, a duet with Kitty Carlisle in Alone and later a typical MGM extravaganza number in Cosi Cosa. Harpo does an Alone obbligato on the harp and Chico dazzles the crowd with his pistol fingered piano rendition of All I Do Is Dream Of You.I'm not sure how Giuseppe Verdi would have taken the finale of A Night at the Opera in which the opening of Il Trovatore is mangled for the ages. All in the interest of seeing Allan Jones gets both a break and Kitty Carlisle. And they do make beautiful music.And the Marx Brothers make some really funny comedy in one of their best films."
26,A Night at the Opera,8,14 November 2007,A Classic Comedy,"A new love of mine is the Marx Brothers. Actually, I have known of them for a while, but haven't come to appreciate them till now. I was introduced to them when I was 8 or 9 and it was through just one movie, Go West. The movie is really not a great film and at times, it's not really a good film, but as a kid I loved certain parts of it, especially the stage coach scene in which the brothers and the passengers try to survive a bumpy carriage ride. Really, the film has classic Groucho lines but they have to carry the movie more than they should.Up until a few nights ago, I never really appreciated the Marx Brothers for their films outside what I remember from Go West and left it at that. Then I happened across a documentary on PBS about the life of Groucho Marx and his rise, fall, and rise again in the Hollywood landscape. It was fascinating and if you ever get a chance, I recommend you check it out to- it really is a good introduction to Groucho Marx and what type of person he was. Anyway, a few nights later I saw the movie, A Night at the Opera, was playing on TV and decided that this would be a great movie to watch while all this new found knowledge and appreciation for the Marx Brothers was swirling in my head. I set my TiVO to record the program but ended up watching the whole thing in real time due to sheer interest and getting hooked into the film early.The film tells the tale of one Otis P. Driftwood (Groucho) who plays a business manager of a wealthy woman (Groucho's long time straight madam Margaret Dumont) looking to become a well known name in New York's elite. While in Europe, Driftwood arranges to have her place a rather large sum of money into the New York Opera which uses the money to pay a famous opera tenor, Rodollfo Lassparri (Walter King) to sing in their upcoming season in New York. Lassparri has a thing for one of his female cast member who is in love with a younger and struggling tenor, and he uses his new found fame and wealth to bring her to New York to hopefully win her away from her young suitor all the while dealing with his dresser/lackey played by Harpo Marx and the young tenors cousin, played by Chico Marx.The move is a seamless role of gags and one-liners that really never slows down except for a rather long musical number on a cruise ship. The film is a classic for seeing Grouch at the top of his game and you begin to look forward to his scenes since he really has no joke that doesn't fall flat. I did laugh out loud several times through out the movie and had steady chuckles the rest of the time.It's a blast to watch the opening scene with Groucho and Margaret Dumont. Their chemistry is undeniable and as the scene rolls, the background characters stop what they are doing and just sit a watch these two actors go back and forth verbally for the whole scene. The film is filled with other memorable scenes (gags) such as people trying to get Harpo to talk (he was the silent one who communicated through sounds) or Groucho talking to large crowds of people while making them the subjects of the jokes he spews, and the classic stateroom scene- take my word for it, it is hilarious. The final act, in the New York Opera House, is a great example of the physical comedy that Harpo and Chico were capable of and is fun to watch since it was all done in live action (remember this is before the days of CGI stunt men). All in all a great film for families to watch together, there are plenty of jokes and sight gags for the kiddos and rants and raves of the Groucho and Chico for the adults."
27,A Night at the Opera,10,11 June 2007,The Marx Brothers In MGM Style,"The first two Marx Brothers films, THE COCOANUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS, were essentially filmed versions of their great successes on the New York stage. MONKEY BUSINESS, HORSE FEATHERS and DUCK SOUP were specifically created for the screen on the soundstages of Paramount Studios--but when the latter proved a critical and box office fiasco the comedy team found their careers on very uneven ground.Enter Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Thalberg was not known for his comedies and MGM, with its emphasis on prestige pictures and family fare, was an extremely unlikely venue for the brothers, but Thalberg was certain he could pinpoint the reason for their sudden and unexpected failure: DUCK SOUP, and to a certain extent all their previous films, lacked appeal for middle American audiences. The Marx Brothers (without Zeppo, who retired from the act when they left Paramount) signed on the dotted line, Thalberg put the machinery of MGM behind them, and the result was A NIGHT AT THE OPERA.What Thalberg did, essentially, was to place the anarchy of the Marx Brothers at the disposal of romantic subplot. Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) has promised to get Mrs. Claypool ""into society""--for a fee, of course--and has arranged for her finance a season at The New York Opera. What Mrs. Claypool gets for her money is tenor Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter King), an unsavory man who is sweet on soprano Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle), who is in turn in love with tenor Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones.) When Lassparri attempts to trump Baroni both on stage and in Rosa's affections, Baroni's friends Fiorella (Chico) and Tomasso (Harpo) enter the fray. Throw in an impresario (Sig Ruman), three famous aviators, a herd of New York police officers, and an opening night, and before you can sing a chorus of Figaro that special brand of Marx Brothers mania holds full sway.Marx Brothers fans argue a great deal about which was better: the Paramount films or the MGM films? I tend to come down on the side of the Paramount films, in which the humor tends to have a sharper edge, but there's no denying the charm of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA. A list of the film's famous moments would require a catalogue, with the legendary ""stateroom scene"" merely one in a hilarious sequence. The supporting cast is also quite fine; Margaret Dumont is, as always, excellent; Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones are charming indeed. It's all tremendous fun.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
28,A Night at the Opera,10,14 September 2006,one of the greatest,"I've always loved this movie and after listening to Leonard Maltin's commentary on the DVD last night, I now understand a little more why I think it's one the best comedies EVER made. All of the Marx Bros. movies are worth a look but my other favorite is ""Duck Soup"". I've now completed my collection. I have all their movies on DVD plus another collection of just documentaries, interviews, TV appearances, a TV pilot Chico did (pretty dreadful but important historic document), episodes of ""You Bet Your Life"", private Marx Brothers' home movies, etc. What a fascinating family and what a delightful comedy team! I have and shall continue to watch them over and over. Each time, I laugh like it was the first time. What a relief to momentarily escape these truly desperate times."
29,A Night at the Opera,10,15 May 2006,incredibly funny & entertaining,"The running debate over which is best Marx Bros. movie, ""A Night"" or ""Duck Soup"" is simply ridiculous. Both are as enjoyable as films can be. I lean towards ""A Night"" because it is more structured, and has a fantastic range of humorous bits. Of course, everyone has seen the stateroom scene but many other delicacies abound:the opening with Margaret Dumont waiting at a table for an hourwhile Groucho is romancing a pretty young thing a table away.the speech in front of the microphones, the mayor and all of NYC,in which Chico tells how (as famous aviators) they ""flew"" across the Atlantic (which after he finishes, Groucho whispers to Chico that he's going to arrange Chico's bail), and then Harpo, while getting ready to speak, pours an Atlantic Ocean amount of water before he can speak, before finally leaving his beard on the chief of police.the contract ripping scene (there ain't no sanity clause).the hotel room scene with the moving beds.the villain tenor (Lasparri) being chased from the stage (""they threw a tomato at me!"" whereupon Groucho says that watermelons were out of season).etc., etc., etc. Even the music was great - ""Alone,"" ""Cosi, Cosa"" and, of course, the strains from Verdi's masterpiece, ""Il Trovatore."" It is a national treasure which still holds up even 70+ years later.To compare this movie with most of today's so-called comedies (with their filth, puerile themes, bathroom ""humor"", etc.) is criminal.The comedic genius, Woody Allen, when asked for his inspirations and favorite comedians of the past, immediately cited Groucho as No. 1, with Harpo next. I feel that some of Woody's early work is Marxian in nature (""Bananas,"" ""Take the Money and Run,"" ""Sleeper"" for example). Absurdist humor that really tickles the funnybone.At any rate, anyone who has not seen any of the Marx Bros. films through 1941's ""The Big Store"" is in for a treat."
30,A Night at the Opera,9,19 March 2006,"A Classic.  A Little Long in the Tooth, but...","...still very funny. One of the scenes -- in the crowded stateroom -- may be the single funniest of the many Marx Brothers hilarious routines. For a movie that is 70-plus years old with camera work that is badly dated, ""A Night at the Opera"" continues to deserve its place on the list of comedy classics. All the usual Marx Brothers shticks are there -- Chico's piano, Harpo's harp and horn, Groucho's leer and loping walk -- and Margaret Dumont, Groucho's perennial foil, but one of the more remarkable facts about this movie is that Kitty Carlisle, the female lead, is still alive and reportedly vigorous and beautiful. This is almost 71 years later! And she was certainly in her mid-20s when the movie was made. Some people will remember Kitty as Moss Hart's wife or as a luminous presence on TV or for her memoirs but to see her as a movie star, singer and love interest opposite Alan Jones would be enough of a reason to see ""A Night at the Opera"" even if it weren't the Marx Brothers' most famous movie. And, oh yes, George S. Kaufman collaborated with Morrie Ryskind on the screen play."
31,A Night at the Opera,10,4 March 2006,Timeless execution of the creme of comedy,"This film is hilarity defined. Any film that includes a civil war joke and makes fun of the Castro beard before Castro rose to power warrants immediate high marks. The only fault I can find in the film is the horrendous jump cut edits, especially in the beginning, which sabotage the jokes, otherwise the movie is a howler. The film somehow manages to ring true all of comedy's leading talents. The jokes remain topical and timeless and are executed with a deftness encompassing all the showbiz smaltz you could hope for. I would really like to know if the Marx Bros are actually playing the instruments in the musical numbers, chico's piano playing is a total delight, its inconceivable that the other reviewer would find these fascinating physical comedic segments ""boring musical numbers"". To overlook these gems is to err and slight the subtle art of physical comedy. View and be mesmerized."
32,A Night at the Opera,7,3 October 2005,Thalberg softened their image but the Marxes are still pretty much the troublemakers they always were,"The Marx Bros. are an acquired taste and to say that this film is a laugh riot from start to finish would be stretching the truth. There are some very funny moments indeed and they mostly belong to the motormouth Groucho. It's hard to remember what his best line in this movie is because there are so many great ones. The two other brothers are as they have always been in nearly every of their previous endeavors and the new addition Allan Jones is sappy but weren't all the straight men that way. The fourth Marx brother, Zeppo said that he was ten times as funny as Groucho but he wasn't allowed to show it off and that is probably the reason he bowed out after Paramount dropped them.MGM or rather Irving Thalberg saw that there was still life in their act but he made them into more heroic figures than Paramount. Still, there is enough irreverence in them to drive a cop mad (the bed switching routine) and to make a mockery of a very public event honoring three Russian aviators and almost causing an international incident in the progress.As there is a sappy straight man there must be a sappy straight woman and the two of them sing a sappy love song that takes up way too much screen time. There aren't enough of Groucho's favorite foil Margaret Dumont either but seeing Sig Rumann as the target of Groucho's one-liners is almost as much fun. Too bad the other villain, Walter King is such a slimy bowl of puss that you almost wished that he died from that blow to the head he receives from Harpo.The opera scene is of course one of the great moments in film history and had perfect timing from all concerned and the film ends happily as most of the MGM films did. So maybe the Marxes weren't their typical low-life selves but they could still make mischief like no other comedy team and we should appreciate Thalberg for giving them an opportunity like this, otherwise they could have been easily forgotten today."
33,A Night at the Opera,7,3 July 2005,Missing Zeppo,"Alright, the Marx Brothers were hardly zippo without Zeppo. He was the straight guy, and not in the same clever way Bud Abbott was. ""A Night At The Opera"" is plenty entertaining without him, with one of the most justly famous comedy routines ever filmed, the famous ""Stateroom"" scene. ""Night At The Opera"" is a solid comedy, just not the classic people claim, and I wonder whether a little light left the brothers when Zeppo decided to retire before this film was made.Professional leach Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) is fooled into signing unknown opera singer Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones) by Baroni's pal and manager Fiorello (Chico). When Driftwood takes a cruise back to America, Baroni and Fiorello stow away inside Driftwood's steamer trunk, along with Fiorello's mute buddy Tomasso (Harpo).""A Night At The Opera"" was the first Marx Brothers movie made at MGM, and adheres to that studio's grander style of movie-making, however uncomfortably matched with the Brothers' kitchen-sink anarchy. A peek at the cruise ship's steerage section is full of music-making and brilliant costumes out of Ziegfeld. On deck, Baroni and his lady-love Rosa (Kitty Carlisle) burst into fully-orchestrated song, while Chico and Harpo perform extended solos on piano and harp, respectively.It's fun watching these scenes for the things you aren't supposed to notice, like how the hammy little boy in the background pushes the smaller boy out of the shot during Chico's number. But the comedy is key. I love the scene where Harpo clocks his former employer, the nasty tenor Lassparri, with his trusty mallet, then runs over to give him smelling salts while Groucho looks on.""You're sorry for what you did?"" Groucho asks. ""That shows a nice spirit."" Then Lassparri wakes up, and Harpo hits him again before the singer can get a word out. Watch especially how Harpo uses his mallet to softly lower Lassparri's head to the ground so it won't land too hard, this of course after he's brained him twice.The stateroom scene is especially fabulous, because as the room fills up with people, you can see funny things going on in every corner of the frame. Groucho trying to get a manicure, a maid trying to mop the floor, Harpo sleeping on a bedmaker and then on a procession of plates. Groucho's running commentary is perfect as he cheerfully welcomes newcomers inside. Groucho's one-liners in this film are among his very best: ""When I invite a woman to dinner I expect her to look at my face. That's the price she has to pay.""One of the key reasons this film was a hit in its time, and ""Duck Soup"" wasn't, was because the latter was more madcap, in a way audiences of the day weren't used to. Today, ""Duck Soup"" is a template for film comedy, while ""Opera's"" pretense at high culture comes off forced, and its romantic storyline quickly grows tiresome, however charming Carlisle and Jones are.It's not just the non-Marx moments that grate. The famous contract scene with Groucho and Chico seems weaker to me than its reputation warrants, while another scene where the Brothers pull the wool over a city detective's eyes by moving some furniture comes off as labored and lame, unworthy of the Marx reputation. Even Harpo's acrobatics at the end seem excessive, a circus act with pretensions of slapstick.The fact is ""Night At The Opera"" has a very high reputation, and the fault may be mine for coming to it with grander expectations. It's a pleasing comedy with some great moments. But it's an odd thing how so many call this the high point for the Brothers, then readily agree everything they made after was fair to poor.I like ""Night At Casablanca"" and ""Day At The Races"" well enough for what they are. I like this, too. MGM was a great studio, with more stars than the heavens, as was often said, only they didn't know what to do with these three. ""Night At The Opera"" shows why the Marx Brothers are so loved, but it also shows the beginnings of an ill fit that would chafe more as time went on."
34,A Night at the Opera,10,5 August 2004,One of my Top 5,"Simply put, there's not a wasted frame in this classic. It has all the elements, and should be on everyone's top 10 list. Combining the low-brow antics and the musical talents of the Marx Brothers with the ""high art"" of opera, this film is the benchmark for classic comedy. The stowage class dinner scene, the overture featuring ""take me out to the ballgame,"" cutting down the pompous impressarios, the CLASSIC stateroom gag - it's all put together in such a way to keep the story developing, and keeping the film moving at a steady and comfortable pace. This is a must see for audiences of all ages.""Here's a quarter - get yourself a stogie.""That is all."
35,A Night at the Opera,,16 July 2001,The great `Night at the Opera' vs `Duck Soup' debate goes on!,"The great `Night at the Opera' vs `Duck Soup' debate goes on! There's no denying that `A Night at the Opera' is a terrific film, well-crafted and funny, with some of the Marx Brothers' best lines delivered at the height of their comic power. But it was deliberately skewed to attract a more mainstream audience than their Paramount films. The outrageous comedy is tempered with a stronger romance and the Boys are sweetened up. Groucho passes love notes between the two separated romantic leads, Chico is concerned with helping his friends, and Harpo is a lovable clown rather than a mischievous imp. Almost everyone agrees that the new formula worked for this film-it's incredibly popular with both Marx Brothers fans and the general public-but it was the beginning of the end for the Marx Brothers' almost surreal comic style.Best moments: The Stateroom scene is often cited as the standout bit, but I submit that it's almost rivaled by the hotel scene, which has wonderful timing, great Groucho asides and a knockout punchline.`Duck Soup' was placed in a fictional land, and in that parallel universe the comedy could be stretched far into the realm of the Bizarre.  No one needed a romance to motivate their actions-the Brothers were concerned only with deflating their pompous and insidious enemies while having a good time for themselves.  This is THE film for fans of pure, undistilled Marx insanity, while `A Night at the Opera' wins top honors as best film featuring the Marx Brothers.Best moments: The `Freedonia's Going to War' piece is a rare big production number that lets the Brothers cut loose in the middle of it. Chico and Harpo's espionage report is classic MB wordplay. And Zeppo walking out of a room and realizing his hat has been cut in half (I can't explain the context-you have to see it), is a sight gag of rare subtlety.Both films have many more `best moments,' of course. These are just my faves. See both `A Night at the Opera' and `Duck Soup' a.s.a.p. and find your own favorite moments!"
36,A Night at the Opera,6,19 December 2005,Wanted to Like It More Than I Actually Did,"Marx Brothers movies are hard to review, because you can't apply the same criteria to them as you can to other movies. The Marx Brothers created an entire method for delivering screen comedy; they created the rules and the logic, and you either accept that logic or you don't.I have to base my opinion on ""A Night at the Opera,"" therefore, on whether or not I laughed, and I didn't, much. I smiled and chuckled here and there, but I just didn't think this movie was that funny. I had a phalanx of film scholars on one of the DVD's special features telling me how funny certain classic bits in this movie are: the ""sanity clause"" routine, the stateroom scene, etc. But as actually played out, these scenes are moderately amusing but not much more. They have the feel of those Saturday Night Live skits that would be funnier if they were only about 5 minutes shorter. Supposedly, ""A Night at the Opera"" was the first of a new kind of Marx Brothers movie, more structured and with more dramatic conflict. The only other movie I've seen by them to compare this to is ""Duck Soup,"" and I say give me the anarchic Brothers any day and dramatic structure be damned.There is one sequence in this movie that I loved, and that's when Chico and Harpo step out of character and display their skill on the piano and harp, respectively. These musical interludes are a much-needed respite from the atrocious, warbly songs performed by the film's male and female love interests.I would recommend any Marx Brothers movie for the same reason I would recommend Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton or Astaire/Rogers films. They're part of cinematic history, and they played a large role in defining the art form at a specific point in its development. But that's not to say you will necessarily enjoy them as much as audiences at the time did.Grade: B-"
37,A Night at the Opera,,11 January 2004,The Best Marx Brother Movie,"Shady business manager, Groucho, promises to get wealthy widow Margaret Dumont into high society by making her a sponsor of the arts.  When they go to Europe to hire the world's greatest opera singer, Groucho runs into Chico and Harpo, who trick him into signing a talented unknown, Allan Jones.  The three brothers then see to it that Jones sings in New York, even if it means destroying the opera in the process during the hilarious climax.  The Marx Brothers' first film for MGM is arguably their best.  Granted, we must endure a romantic subplot featuring Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle and some non-comic opera singing, but it is a small price to pay for the laughs.  (My eyes only gaze over during the Jones/Carlisle duet at the boat.  The rest of the numbers aren't bad, and Chico and Harpo's musical interludes were never better than in this film.)  The stuffy world of the opera provides the perfect backdrop for the Marx Brothers' creative anarchy.  Producer Irving Thalberg really believed in the Brothers and worked to craft them a perfect comic environment to play against.  The Paramount films all have a slapdash, low budget feel to them.  Thalberg gave the brothers a wonderful script, which they honed on the road, and first-rate A-list production values. Technically-speaking, this is their best-looking and sounding film.  It features nice sets and uniformly good performances from the supporting cast. Too bad Thalberg didn't live longer.  Under his personal tutelage, they might have made more films of this quality.  As it was, this blueprint Thalberg created would become a stifling formula which would encase them during the rest of their years at MGM in a series of  increasingly less interesting and funny films.  (I refuse to end on such a negative note. None of their films, except perhaps ""Love Happy"" are worthless.  They all provide laughs.  The only difference is the quantity.)"
38,A Night at the Opera,10,22 June 2004,a controversial classic,"""A Night at the Opera"" intentionally tones down the Marx Brothers, cuts down their barrage of jokes, and imposes a semi-serious storyline over the wild tomfoolery that had characterized their previous movies.  The result is a celebrated but controversial film that is recognized as one of their best, even though it is widely considered to be the start of a downward trend in their careers.Irving Thalberg was probably the real mastermind behind this movie; he's the one who believed that a good plot and a less manic pace would make ""A Night at the Opera"" a bigger hit than the previous Marx Brothers films.  And he was right, mostly.  The story is good, especially as it develops a strong set of villains for the brothers to play against.  But, even though it's very funny, ""A Night at the Opera"" is noticeably lacking in belly laughs when compared to ""Duck Soup"" or ""Monkey Business.""  This is the Marx Brothers on medication.  In low gear.  Playing it safe. 
Until the end, that is, when they are unleashed upon the opera itself. Their attempts to sabotage the performance constitute nothing less than the greatest slapstick segment in movie history.  In fact, I'm hard pressed to think of any film with a more exciting, hilarious, or satisfying climax. It's worth sitting through the romance and the musical numbers just to see Harpo bring anarchy to the most ordered and elitist environment imaginable.Nevertheless, ""Duck Soup"" is a funnier and more relevant movie, even though it's not as well structured or ""feel-good"" as ""A Night at the Opera."" Though ""A Night at the Opera"" is great, it represents a different and ultimately wrong-headed approach to Marx Brothers comedy.  They should be unleashed from start to finish, not just at the end.  I can't resist comparing ""Duck Soup"" to a raw, first-draft work of elemental power, and ""A Night at the Opera"" to a heavily edited, workshopped, committee-approved product.  Both are classics, but the former is visionary whereas the latter is undeniably old-fashioned.Still, part of the joy of being a Marx Brothers fan is that their movies are all very different.  The MGM style ain't all bad.  When I watch ""A Night at the Opera,"" I find that it's nice to care about the supporting characters a bit, just for a change.  So maybe I lied.  Maybe this IS the best one. Depends on my mood.  And the time of day.  Watch 'em both and decide for yourself."
39,A Night at the Opera,,3 February 2002,"Why is the debate between this and ""Duck Soup""?","Another commenter mentioned something about the debate between whether ""A Night at the Opera"" or ""Duck Soup"" is the Marxes' best movie. My question is, why? While ""A Night at the Opera"" is not a bad film, it pales in comparison to ""Duck Soup"", and is not as good as ""Horse Feathers"", ""Animal Crackers"", or ""Monkey Business.""I've heard that ""A Night at the Opera"" has a more well-polished plot than the others, etc., etc. But who cares??? The Marxes are not to be watched for their developed plots! We wanna see absurdity! We wanna see zaniness! We wanna see more hijinx, not romantic subplots! We wanna see mischeivous guys, not the softened-up version that this movie has to offer!As a whole, this movie is not that bad. The stateroom scene and hotel room scene of course are the best, and there are some other good lines too. But I nearly fell asleep when whats-his-face started singing ""Alone"", yada yada yada. This movie is pretty funny, but I don't agree with those who say it's the funniest movie of all time (however, I have more respect for these people than those who say that, for example, ""Scary Movie"" is the funniest movie of all time). The movie does, however, represent the decline of the Marxes. Their next picture was ""A Day at the Races"", which wasn't nearly as good, and things just got worse from there.Bottom line: See this movie, but don't gimme that crap about it being better than some of the earlier Marx Brothers movies."
40,A Night at the Opera,10,18 December 2009,Hilarious!,"A Night At The Opera is very silly at times, but it is absolutely hilarious. A simply brilliant film, with so many memorable scenes, that is guaranteed to have you in tears of laughter. The Marx Brothers do a superlative job here with their zany antics, and their rough-around- the-edges humour was truly unique. The cinematography was fabulous, the pace was fast moving, the screenplay was inventive and phenomenally witty, and the plot is effective enough without being contrived. The romance between the two songbirds Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle was sweet, and while it has thought been thought to be of irrelevance to the story, it didn't detract too much for me to enjoy this film. The music is wonderful as well. As for my favourite scene I can't possibly choose as there were so many priceless scenes. The contract scene between Groucho and Chico was unforgettable, as was the ruination of Il Trovatore which happens to be one of the best comedy climaxes. But my favourite scene, if I had to choose, is the shenanigans inside Groucho's cabin on the transatlantic liner, it is quite simply one of the silliest scenes in comedy history. All in all, a true comedy classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
41,A Night at the Opera,10,3 April 2007,Newly Released Deleted Scenes,"I just watched the limited edition German DVD release of this film. It is much funnier to watch these classic scenes dubbed into German. With this version there is no odd editing, jump cuts, or pauses left in to accommodate the audience's laughter.The bonus features on this release are nothing less than revelatory!!! The alternate take from the stateroom scene had me howling! As the maid pushes her way into the stateroom, she audibly passes gas and Chico takes a whiff & says, ""I think these hard boiled eggs are rotten."" The fact that this whole scene is dubbed in German just makes it exponentially funnier! Of the 4 bonus deleted scenes on the disc, the best is the one where Groucho, in his bathing suit, steps into a bathtub filled with reconstituted bacon grease & then says, ""Wait, something here isn't kosher."" Then proceeds to call room service and complains that his tub was supposed to have been filled with jello. And concludes the conversation with room service by saying, ""What kind of place are you running here? I'm entertaining some very important people tonight."" This long lost scene is a total knee-slapper, & should have been left in the original theater release. However, the semi-nude scene with Margaret Dumont was not funny and was completely inappropriate. With all due respect, I do not find her particularly attractive. This footage probably should have been burned as I now need psychological counseling as a result of seeing it.I am looking forward to the rest of the Marx Brothers films being released on DVD by this German company. The sound and picture are vastly superior to the American Region 1 release, and the deleted scenes are bombastically hilarious!!!! Duck Soup is probably the Brothers finest work, but Night at the Opera is a close second. These 2 films are the most solidly funny. The other films at times may be zanier, but they are not as consistently funny. The Marx Brothers were comedic pioneers who did their best work live on the stage. Some of their energy was lost in transitioning to the big screen. It is unfortunate that there are no quality surviving films of their vintage live performances. They were older and slightly past their prime when they began to make films."
42,A Night at the Opera,,4 September 2006,The Party of the First Part Ends,"Fortune's wand passed over these guys for a few years and they gave us a particular kind of humor.Two kinds, actually. And this movie has great examples of each, woven into what already had become disturbing MGM padding. Oh, you should know that I consider the best of their films to be the earliest where they packed the things with relatively non-stop zaniness. Of the two types of Marx humor, the most interesting is the word play. This was new to movies and in fact the industry sought them out from the New York stage where verbal humor was well established. Their one verbal skit in this project is the argument between Chico and Groucho over a contract. ""Just go over the first part of the party of the First Part."" Its classic.The second kind of humor is a sort of layered craziness that builds and builds with all sorts of comic effects that have nothing to do with each other. That's what makes it ""zany,"" not that what they do is funny but that they serve us from so many different traditions at the same time. The exemplar scene this time is the breakfast scene, ending when the cop comes and then they shift to simply one bit: frustrate the cop.I suppose it won't be long before some clever editor makes one movie out of all the good bits of what we have from them, without the love stories and the singing. And without the ordinary jokes. For instance there's a dreadful bit in here about the three stowaways stealing beards and making speeches at a reception for the expected, celebrated aviators. Its a grind, literally a painful grind to watch this bit.I think it should be possible to combine all their good parts together since the stories are so similar (except the anti-war bits of ""Duck Soup""). We really should have this because the bad parts (oh, those songs!) keep audiences away. How many other entertainers can claim to have invented even one form of cinematic humor?Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
43,A Night at the Opera,10,29 September 2005,Can you sleep on your stomach with such big buttons on your pajamas?,"After Duck Soup's failure at the box office and Zeppo's retirement, it looked like the Marx Bros. careers were over. But thanks to the help of Producer Irving Thalberg, this was not so. The Marx Bros. were able to make a grand comeback with A Night at the Opera. It features some of their best work, such as the uproarious state room scene and some hilarious mayhem at an Opera house. No description can do these scenes justice, so I'll end there. A Night at the Opera has a much stronger cast than most of their films. Allan Jones is a worthy successor for Zeppo, and Kitty Carlisle plays his love interest. Even though Margaret Dumont essentially plays the same character in all of her Marx Bros. films (she either loved Groucho or she hated him), Mrs. Claypool is my favorite Dumont character. The name ""Claypool"" cracks me up for some reason. The actor who plays Gottlieb (can't think of his name) gives a very funny performance. Fortunately he would reappear in A Day at the Races and A Night in Casablanca. I usually fast forward the musical numbers in their post-Paramount films, but A Night at the Opera has the best musical numbers of the MGM era. ""Cosi Cosa"" is great fun, and ""Alone"" is touching. It has a more conventional plot than their Paramount movies, which is my only criticism. I miss the anarchy of their previous films.Still, A Night at the Opera is without a doubt the best of the Marx Brothers post Paramount work, and arguably their best film. It was a huge success, and until A Day at the Races (1937) it was the Marx's highest grossing film. A Night at the Opera is the Marx Bros. film for you if you don't like the anarchic style of the Paramount era."
44,A Night at the Opera,8,18 September 2005,Pity poor old Otto when Otis got back,"This is the best mainstream Marx Bros film, more accessible as less zany than the Paramounts. If you prefer their more surreal nonsense like me it has to be Duck Soup or Horse Feathers, but this has all their best elements in too, albeit expertly tamed for more mass consumption by Irving Thalberg.I didn't understand that last post - is there a different print available that combines all they did in one release! The copy I have is definitely in need of tlc because it has been chopped about, especially at Two Beers Bartender. The story has been dissected and mulled over, but to me it has almost ascended into folklore, the number of times I've seen it mean I know it almost by heart - even the backward argument at the aviators presentation. Allan Jones's & Kitty Carlisle's rendition of ""Alone"" has passed into classic status - did anyone have an inkling when filming those scenes at the ""docks""?Utterly marvellous stuff, the 1st Marx Bros film with a unified plot and imho their 3rd best overall."
45,A Night at the Opera,10,10 September 2005,Marx Brothers At Their Best,"""I would like to make some pictures with you fellows. I mean real pictures."" When producer Irving Thalberg said that to the Marx Brothers, he was immediately challenged by Groucho. Name any movie with more laughs than Cocoanuts, Animal Crackers, or Duck Soup. Sure, those pictures were funny, Thalberg conceded. ""But they weren't movies. They weren't about anything."" I'll make a movie with half as many laughs, he continued, and a solid storyline, and we'll make twice as much money as Duck Soup. Turns out he was right. Night At the Opera was the best movie the Marxes ever made, and it doubled Duck Soup's gross. Margaret Dumont is Mrs. Claypool, a wealthy widow (what else?), who hopes Otis B. Drigtwood (Groucho) of the New York Opera Company will get her into society (is she kidding?). Ricardo Baroni (Alan Jones) is an obscure tenor trying to make a name for himself; he's in love with the female star of the opera, Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle). Also interested in Rosa is the obnoxious Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King), the leading tenor, but she wants nothing to do with him. When Groucho hears that Lassparri gets a thousand dollars a night for singing, he utters a line that apparently went over the head of the censor: ""You can get a phonograph record of Minnie the Moocher for seventy-five cents. For a buck and a quarter you can get Minnie."" There are two scenes in the picture that qualify as classics. The first is the stateroom scene, where about fifty people try to cram into a cabin the size of a large closet. The other is the contract negotiation between Chico and Groucho (""The party of the first part shall be known in this contact as the party of the first part.""), where they continue to rip off sections of the contract until both wind up holding small slips of paper. A closing word regarding Margaret Dumont. Apparently she really was the prim Victorian lady she portrayed on the screen, or as Groucho put it simply, ""She never understood the jokes."" As Groucho and Maggie leave the boat, the following dialogue ensues:Mrs. Claypool: ""Otis, do you have everything?""Driftwood: ""I've never had any complaints yet."" After the take, Maggie turned to Groucho and asked: ""Groucho, what does that mean?"" In Duck Soup, when Groucho tells his men, ""You're fighting for this woman's honor, which is probably more than she ever did,"" Dumont had no idea what he was talking about. The fact that half the time, she didn't have a clue as to what was happening makes the pictures even funnier."
46,A Night at the Opera,8,4 September 2005,One of the Marx Brothers' best,"The three incomparable Marx Brothers in one of their best films. Rudolpho is an unknown opera singer trying to get noticed by the head of a major opera company. He's in love with soprano Kitty Carlisle and to follow her to America, Harpo, Chico and Rudolpho stow away on a ship hiding in Groucho's steamer trunk. The finale takes place during an opera with Chico sneaking the score of ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" into the musical score and Harpo swinging from the backdrop riggings while a detective tries to catch him. A Night at the Opera contains the standard elements of all Marx Brothers films. Groucho's outrageous insults, Chico's twisted logic, and Harpo's brilliant mime abilities. The witty lines in this film written for Groucho by George S. Kaufman are among the best and he gets off some choice insults to Margaret Dumont's character Mrs. Teasdale. Chico's scene where he explains how they flew to America is a classic example of his screwball logic. The ""party of the first part"" contract scene between Groucho and Chico is insane. Harpo's mime ability is shown multiple times especially when he tries to play the piano. Ignore the song and dance numbers and the sappy love story between the male and female leads and enjoy the brilliant Marx brothers."
47,A Night at the Opera,9,15 April 2005,The peak of the Marx Brothers,"This, the sixth of the Marx Brothers' movies, must be considered one of their best, if not their absolute best. As opposite to most of the movies before this, then ""A Day At The Opera"" actually has a stable plot. The movies before this, had a story line so vague, that you can hardly call it a plot. Whereas it here shows, that the brothers' comedy evolved best when within the frame of a plot. Groucho's jokes and ""babble"" is so much better here, and Chico's and especially Harpo's gags are superb at any time in this movie. The classic scene, with all people crowded in Groucho's (Otis B. Driftwood) cabin, must be the Marx Brothers' greatest scene in here, even the selection of who's to come into the cabin is perfect, right from the engineer, over the young woman who looks for Aunt Minnie (that's actually a classic in itself) to the maid who has to mop up. What also makes this scene so great, is that there is so much to watch at once, so you can see it over and over again and discover new stuff. Because we automatically focuses on who comes in, which means, from the engineer first comes in, we normally don't pay attention to the maids to chance the sheets anymore. But I watched them constantly over the entire scene is interesting, and then watching the scene again, only keeping an eye on the engineer(s) etc. I guess I'm biased. The other really great scene is the very underrated scene with Detective Henderson trying to find Harpo, Chico and their companion Ricardo Baroni in Groucho's room. This is also where Groucho get's to fire some of the greatest jokes in the movie (""I notice the table is set for four"" ""That's nothing. My alarm clock is set for eight"" - ""The last time I was in this room there were four beds here"" ""Please! I'm not interested in your private life, Henderson."") A truly wonderful scene, and Robert Emmett O'Connor's role in this movie is greatly underestimated. But the movie have many more great scenes, like when Herman Gottlieb finds Groucho, Chico, Harpo and Baroni smoking and drinking in his (Gottlieb's) office, that picture is simply unpriceable. And of course the ending scenes of the movie is a smash too. With Lassparri (who is Baroni's opponent) singing and performing in an old Italian setting, when suddenly he has a battleship behind him.The plot in the movie is quite simple. Both Baroni and Lassparri is in love with the same girl. Lassparri is famous and Baroni is not, but the girl, Rosa Castaldi, prefers Baroni. And the Marx Brothers' efforts lies mostly in bringing the two lovers together. It may not be a master-plot, and the love scenes may not be that funny. But it holds things together, and secures that the jokes and gags aren't meaningless.People are often complaining about the songs in this movie, and true, they are not my favourite, but the other Marx Brothers movies also had songs, and compared to those songs, then ""Alone"" and ""Cosi-Cosa"" isn't so bad. I did however find the obligatory piano and harp playing a bit silly, since all this kids, who clearly exaggerated their laughter was somewhat embarrassing, even though the piano and harp melodies (the latter being a ""re-make"" of the ""Alone"" - which had previously been sung in the movie) are very good. The only other singing, is the inclusion of ""Il trovatore"" by Verdi, which is used magnificently, and is simply wonderful.All in all, then I am so puzzled, when people announce Duck Soup for the Marx Brothers' greatest. This one is far better than it on all accounts. Groucho's lines, Chico and Harpo's gags, the co-cast of the movie, the songs, the plot, all is better on ""A Day At The Opera"" - a true classic."
48,A Night at the Opera,,9 April 2005,Delightful extra out of character,"I last watched ""A Night At The Opera"" about two years ago. I just recently watched it again on the new DVD and remembered catching a delightful slip-up by the director.When the Marx Bros. were at top form, all a director had to do was point the camera and get out of the way, which is what Sam Wood appears to have done in the first scene. Any modern director would have caught the mistake and re-shot the scene. But I'm glad Wood didn't.Dumont, waiting for Groucho in the restaurant, has him paged. He turns out to have been sitting right behind her, having dinner with a young blonde. He looks at the check, and hands it to the blonde for her to pay. All well and good, but the blonde, to stay in character, should have gotten up in a huff and walked off. When we next see her, as Groucho is introducing Dumont to Gottlieb in a never-ending loop, she's still there, but has completely dropped out of character. She's watching the comedy as if she's in the audience with us and comes close to losing it at the end, as her shoulders start to shake with laughter.Most of the time, such slips detract from the scene (e.g. the kid who stuffs his fingers in his ears in anticipation of the gunshot in ""North by Northwest""), but this makes me enjoy the movie even more, to know that the people in it were having such a good time being there."
49,A Night at the Opera,7,24 September 2004,The Best of the Marx Brother Films,"Whether or not it is the funniest or their greatest film. A Night at the Opera was the Marx Brother's most successful comedy. If you've seen one Marx Brother film, you've seen them all. Each has its own original style of comedy with its quick ""one liners"" and physical comedy. Most if not all Marx Brother comedies has one if not several musical numbers. A Night at the Opera is not only a comedy but a musical as well. For 1935, this was not just a funny look at what could go wrong at an opera, but a look at an opera! Your typical movie goer would not have experienced what going to an opera was like. Today, many school children get the opportunity to attend an opera. Back in the 1930's, very few people could afford to attend an opera. Also, not every city had operas available to the public. So for many, A Night at the Opera was to many, there first night at an opera. While many consider Duck Soup to be the Marx Brother's greatest movie (even though it bombed at the box office in the 1930's) A Night at the Opera remains there most successful film with MGM."
50,A Night at the Opera,10,27 September 2003,Laugh out loud...hilarious!!!,"I had just recently been introduced to the Marx Brothers just a few months ago when we rented ""Duck Soup."" We both enjoyed it very much so we decided to rent ""A Night at the Opera."" As much as I liked ""Duck Soup,"" this film knocks it out of the water. I may be biased as I am a ""theater person,"" but I think that some of the jokes in the movie are absolutely precious! My personal favorite is ""Was that a High C or Vitamin D."" Priceless. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS CLASSIC COMEDY!!!"
51,A Night at the Opera,8,19 June 2003,The best Marx Brothers film of all...,"In my humble opinion I think that without a doubt, this is the greatest Marx Brothers film of them all! My only complaint is that while watching the film they have two opera songs, of which I hate so I thank God for the fast forward button, other than that there is nothing wrong with this movie; the one liners are top notch and come one right after the other, the gags and slapstick are vintage Marx Brothers, and best of all they destroy a packed opera house. Also this film has one of the greatest tributes to Buster Keaton in it that I have ever seen!"
52,A Night at the Opera,7,28 October 2002,"Standard Marx Bros, which is a good thing","Witty Marx Bros. farce of high society.  Less jokes and a little less anarchistic in its intent and execution than their earlier films (the camera is much more steady and stays closer to the actors here than in, say, the Coconauts).  Margaret Dumont and Groucho Marx were by now establishing themselves within the context of their films as a potent comic pairing."
53,A Night at the Opera,9,28 April 2002,My favourite film,"This is my first comment in IMDB. I'm Mr. Puig. When I saw this movie I was very young; just 5 or 6 years old. Then I reviewed it many times. And now, with 20 years watching movies, I can say that I enjoy A Night at the Opera like the first time! The Marx movies are a few of my favourite films. And, for me, this Night at the Opera is the best comic film ever made! Hurray for Groucho, vive Harpo le silent, congratulations for Chico and his piano scenes! Cosí cosà, the ship room, the theatre, Miss Dumond, the voyage to USA... all of them are magic moments in my particular iconography. I want to recommend this fabulous film to all the people that loves laugh watching cinema. Marx chaos will live always in our hearts. Woody Allen is the last master of this ""school"" build with hilarious, absurd and surrealistic humor. I hope a new pupil will appear soon... (Please! We need people like you in the world!) Meanwhile, we must quietly wait with an ironic smile in our faces."
54,A Night at the Opera,8,26 December 2001,perfect balance,"It has been said, perhaps too often, that when the Marx Brothers arrived at MGM they lost their edge. True, their Paramount comedies were considerably more frantic than their later work, but frantic and unstructured also means (to me) unbalanced and frustrating. Duck Soup may contain some of their funniest sequences but as a film it leaves me feeling a little empty at the end With A Night At The Opera, their first film for MGM, the boys were finally placed into a well structured story. Everything works so well, the romantic sub-plot, generally strained in their previous (and a lot of their subsequent) work, is enjoyable and used well to help the story along. The musical interludes fit perfectly and aren't overstretched (another problem with the boys later work). The comedy set-pieces are perfectly timed and superbly paced.On the whole A Night At The Opera is the perfectly balanced Marx Brothers film, it has enough of the belly-laugh comedy that we expect (the state room scene, the opera) but is, for once, cleverly integrated into a smart plot and some thoroughly enjoyable musical numbers."
55,A Night at the Opera,10,18 January 2001,"While I personally prefer ""Duck Soup"", I love both and admit this is their best film","I absolutely love the Marx Brothers!  This is my second-favorite, after ""Duck Soup"" and just ahead of ""Animal Crackers"".  But this is admittedly the best film they made.  The musical interludes mesh better (obviously, given the plot), the comedy bits are vintage Marx Brothers (including one of the most memorable scenes in movie history) and the plot actually makes sense (heresy in a Marx Brothers film)!  One of the funniest movies ever!  I'd make some half-crazed comments here, but they wouldn't do the boys justice. So, with a bow to the masters, I leave on the following:  You should have come to the first party. I was blind for three days!  Recommended with all my heart, soul and circulatory system!"
56,A Night at the Opera,,9 February 2000,The definitive classic comedy,"Why do comedies today suck so bad?  Because theyve just lost their edge and are forced to resort to foul language to satiate audiences.  A Night at the Opera is one of those films where if you told someone they could learn from the old films, this would be the only one.  Sadly, this type of comedy will never be used again, and its a shame because nothing is funnier, or more appealing, than hearing Groucho's puns and insults.  Harpo was the definitive employer of pantomime, and as for Chico, I'm still bummed he didnt get his ""two hard boiled eggs"".  The stateroom scene still ranks as one of my favorite movie scenes of all time.  Apart from that, blending this zany comic genius with a sweet love story was a true achievement for director Sam Wood.  Everything about this film stands out today, and its something everyone should be able to experience"
57,A Night at the Opera,10,24 October 1999,"Great, but not as great as its reputation","I get the sense that this and ""Duck Soup"" are the only two Marx Brothers movies that people (young people) see anymore.  This film's been overpraised since it restored the Marxes' box-office clout in 1935 by critics and fans alike, as well as all the brothers.  The comedy is first-rate, but how great can a film be when you're fast-forwarding through all the musical numbers (and you KNOW you are...)?  Even more distressing is the softening and sanitizing of the brothers' characters from the Paramount films (Groucho hugging the girl on the boat is one particularly depressing example).  Don't hesitate to see it, but if this is your first exposure to the Marx Brothers, you owe it to yourself to follow up with ""Duck Soup"", ""Horse Feathers"" and ""Monkey Business"" to see what they were REALLY meant to be."
58,A Night at the Opera,8,5 December 2016,...And two hard-boiled eggs.,"Groucho Marx is in his element as slick, fast talking business manager Otis B. Driftwood, who spends his time playing up to arts patron Mrs. Claypool (classic Marx Bros. foil Margaret Dumont). When he sees that she's willing to pony up $1,000 a night to have pompous Lassparri (Walter Woolf King) sing, he wants a piece of the action. Circumstance soon throws him together with equally sly Fiorello (Chico) and goofy Tomasso (Harpo), as they become determined to help out young lovers & aspiring opera stars Rosa (Kitty Carlisle) and Ricardo (Allan Jones).Even if one is not a fan of the opera, they shouldn't let that dissuade them from checking out the Marx Bros. in their glory. Some buffs consider this their best film, and it certainly shows off their talents to memorable effect. Musical interludes do go on a bit long, but the quality of the comedy when it occurs is top notch. There are some truly great bits in here, like the ""party of the first part"" contract, the overcrowded (to say the least) stateroom sequence, and the frantic, farcical efforts of Otis, Fiorello, Tomasso, and Ricardo to pull the wool over the eyes of a suspicious inspector (Robert Emmett O'Connor) by moving beds from one room to another.Groucho is hilarious, as always. Very few entertainers in film history can fire off a one-liner as snappily as he does. Chico and Harpo have their wonderful moments, as well. (It's such a hoot when Harpo does a Spider-Man routine near the end.) Carlisle and Jones are extremely appealing, Dumont is once again a fine ""straight woman"", King is an appropriately snooty villain, Sig Ruman is superb as eternally frustrated Gottlieb, and O'Connor is likewise good as the antics of Otis and company take a toll on him.The pace isn't always consistent, but there is some enjoyable action and first rate stunt work. Overall, this is a solid comedy / musical that will appeal to any lover of this era in cinema.Eight out of 10."
59,A Night at the Opera,7,12 September 2012,"Very funny in spots, but  a little overrated","I know some people will consider this an almost heretic opinion, but I don't think ""A Night At The Opera"" is ""as good as it gets"", to put it in Leonard Maltin's words. I think it's about on the same level as ""A Day At The Races"", and both are quite a few steps below ""Duck Soup"" or ""Horse Feathers"". This is the movie that established the MGM formula for the Marx Brothers: while this resulted in higher-budgeted productions, it also had some unfortunate side effects, like turning the brothers into sidekicks and practically ""best men"" for a young couple in love, or them being humiliated in a way that would never happen in their earlier Paramount films (I'm referring mostly to the early scene of Harpo being whipped). Then there is the music: to be honest, Allan Jones' and Kitty Carlisle's opera singing is superb - IF you appreciate opera, which means it is an acquired taste (or, as Groucho Marx puts it, ""On account of you I almost heard the opera!""). But there is an entire section in the middle where a) Allan Jones sings, then b) Chico plays the piano, then c) Harpo plays the piano, then d) Harpo plays the harp. It's a bit of an overkill. With all that said, the ship cabin scene is a legitimate classic of screen comedy, there are plenty of other funny moments around (like Chico's and Harpo's ""speeches"" to the New York public), Groucho is on top form throughout (""You follow me?"" - ""Yes"" - ""Well, stop following me or I'll have you arrested!""), the finale is typically chaotic, and on the whole ""A Night At The Opera"" is one of the better Marx Brothers films. But not the best. *** out of 4."
60,A Night at the Opera,10,29 June 2011,The best of the Marx Brothers movies,"Some of the vaudeville comedy is a bit dated, and some of the sight gags are cheesy, but this is just the best of the best comedy. The Marx Brothers at their peak.Taking all their well honed Vaudeville comedic timing and bringing back Dumont as their foil and putting it all together perfectly.The musical numbers really date the piece, but that's par for the course for these movies. The singing is awesome in general though. They always picked talented people to surround them, and they were talented musicians in their own right.The part at the end where they are changing backgrounds during the singing slays me every time."
61,A Night at the Opera,9,1 January 2011,Funniest of Funny,"this film was phenomenal. This was Groucho's personal favorite and when i found that out i HAD to see it. This film is hysterical and has some of Groucho's best wisecracks. If you ever want a good laugh you'll definitely have to see it. There's days that i feel my worst and I just love watching this because it makes me feel like a million times better. It's a bit different from their films with Paramount, such as the comedy. But you don't really notice until you really really really think about it. Harpo is adorable and so is Chico and Groucho;s just his usual loud self. When I first want to introduce the Marx Brothers to my friends, I either show this film or Duck Soup. But if I had more arms, I'd give this film a 10 thumbs up."
62,A Night at the Opera,10,7 April 2010,American director Sam Wood and three Marx brothers collaborate to make a truly hilarious film.,"""A Night at the Opera"" is a veritable laughter riot.It is really a wonder that it is still remembered as one of the finest collaborations between musicians and comedians.Although it did not feature the entire team of 5 Marx brothers but nevertheless Chico Marx,Groucho Marx and Harpo Marx gave such a praiseworthy performance that audiences never felt the absence of remaining two Marx brothers.This film by Sam Wood succeeded as its comic scenes appear to be truly natural as there is hardly any hint of snobbery nor foolishness.Best scenes of this film involve comedy performed by Groucho Marx.He has played his role so convincingly that one can easily state that Groucho Marx surely knows how to fool women.He cannot be blamed if there are women who would like to be fooled by him.It is believed that all works of art have a message to share with audiences.A night at the opera too has a funny message for its supporters.This film suggests that there are moments in life when even underdogs can have an advantage over their oppressors provided they keep themselves focused."
63,A Night at the Opera,7,30 November 2008,"""Ladies and gentlemen... I guess that takes in most of you""","The Marx Brothers were anarchists. They shunned order in favour of spontaneity and irreverence, and their early work  both onstage and in their films with Paramount  is characterised by this loosely-structured chaos. Story? The Marx Brothers didn't need a story: all that was required was a woman for Groucho to insult, a uptight bureaucrat to whom Chico could speak his own peculiar version of Italian, and an over-sized prop that Harpo might abuse in whatever manner he pleased. When the comedy team (minus Zeppo, who, tired of being the straight man, struck out for greener pastures) moved to MGM, producer Irving Thalberg decided that their style of comedy needed to be combined with the musical extravagance for which the studio had already required a reputation. The Marx Brothers were given creative freedom, glittering sets, elaborate musical numbers and, above all else, a story. Some fans of the comedy troupe view this as an inconvenience, the narrative merely getting in the way of all the jokes, but I think it works.As a result of MGM's influence, 'A Night at the Opera (1935)' bears a remarkable resemblance to an Astaire-Rogers style film (despite most of these being produced at RKO), the only difference being that the bright pair of young performers (here played by Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones) have the aid of three bumbling comedians to facilitate their happy ending. The tale revolves around young in-love opera singers Rosa and Ricardo, the latter of whom can't achieve the recognition he deserves, due to the overbearing influence of the stuffy virtuoso performer Rodolfo (Walter Woolf King). Groucho, proving that he does have something akin to a heart after all, agrees to help Ricardo achieve success in New York, though he takes a lot of coaxing from Chico and Harpo, who are really just along for the ride. Allan Jones fills in the void that would previously have been played by straight-man Zeppo, though Kitty Carlisle's dazzling opera singer is the highlight of the supporting cast. Also enjoyable is the ever-serious Margaret Dumont and Sig Ruman.I've never really been the greatest fan of the Marx Brothers, but I nonetheless enjoy their witty style of humour  particularly anything that Groucho has to say  and, in this film, I appreciated the greater degree of class afforded by the opera setting. In keeping with MGM's standing as the industry leader in movie musicals, 'A Night at the Opera' even includes several genuine opera performances, and it's the real singing voices of both Carlisle and Jones that you are hearing. Chico and Harpo, likewise, don't miss an opportunity to show off their own impressive musical talents, with the former dancing his fingers across the piano keys, and the latter doing likewise on both a piano and his signature harp. While 'Duck Soup (1933)' may have the greater rate of jokes-per-minute, fans of the Marx Brothers can do much worse than to sit down and enjoy the first of the trio's two most commercial successful films {the other being 'A Day at the Races (1937)'}. Going to the opera has never been this chaotic."
64,A Night at the Opera,8,15 July 2008,Wonderful Night At the Opera ***1/2,"A truly classic comedy with the Marx Brothers at the height of their comedic best.The film works because the casting was just perfect. Kitty Carlisle and Robert Alda had the perfect voices for the part. Their rendition of Alone was just memorable. They were also the perfect foils for Groucho, Harpo and Chico.Of course, the great Margaret Dumont was an added bonus to this film and any other Marx film. With that dead pan facial expression, and her vulnerability as a society lady,Dumont etched an unforgettable character in each film that she appeared with the brothers.The plot of the brothers along with Alda being stowaways on the boat is hilarious.Sig Ruman is in fine form as the head of the opera company.The dancing, the singing, the very gaiety of this film will bring out the best in any audience. Truly a memorable classic."
65,A Night at the Opera,8,26 April 2008,Overall movie overcomes its weaker parts.,"This is one great, though flawed Marx brothers comedy (without Zeppo this time).It features all of the usual typical Marx brothers comical ingredients and characters. Groucho plays the fast talking ladies man, Harpo the mute fool and Chico is just being Chico. It features lots of silly classical comedy moments, with a pinch of slapstick as well as some hilarious dialog.Yet this is not a movie without its flaws. Some of its comical moments get stretched out too much and go on for too long. It isn't the best paced Marx brothers movie. Also the singing and musical moments just gets a bit too much at times, which also really slows the movie its story down. Especially when Groucho isn't in the picture the movie starts to drag.Well, of course it's not like the story is anything special in the first place. But luckily this has never been really a requirement for an '30's comedy. It's just a simple, easy, enjoyable story that provides plenty of room for the Marx brothers to show of their antics. Also the other supporting actors did a fine job in the movie and with its comedy.A fine enjoyable silly comedy.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
66,A Night at the Opera,9,2 January 2008,There is No Sanity Clause,"This movie presents a fully matured Marx Brothers trio working for Irving Thalberg at MGM studios. After the younger ones bombed at Paramount because Duck Soup (a very funny film also) did not go well with the public, Thalberg came along & this movie restarted the boys careers. The pace of this is no where near as frantic as Duck Soup but the results are a spectacle.Really toned down in this one is Harpo who while he is still funny, doesn't move around as quickly pulling eye popping routines like he did in Horsefeathers (which is actually better than Duck Soup). A lot of folks favor Duck Soup because it is anti-war, but Horsefeathers is slightly better at deservedly lampooning our education system. When we spend a Night At The Opera with the Brothers, it is a night that will never be forgotten. Groucho & Chico are in top form here. Kitty Carlisle, Alan Jones, Sig Ruman, & Margaret Dumont are along for the ride here. Their support is very good. Carlisle even gets a pass made at her by Groucho.The brother routines are honed for this one because they took them on the road at the request of Thalberg & tried all of them in front of a live audience & perfected them into what is put on film. The routines work really well here because of that. They do the same thing for A Day At The Races after this one, but the script in that one is overstuffed with music. That makes the next film too long.While there is music in this, it doesn't get in the way of the brothers. This film has just the right amount of music to go with the brothers antics. Sadly, the only time they nearly approach this again is with A Night in Casablanca years later. Strangely, Kitty Carlisle went on to achieve more fame doing game shows than this film, but this is about the only film Kitty is remembered for. If you can't get a hold of Horse Featers or Duck Soup, this is the brothers film to see."
67,A Night at the Opera,9,6 February 2007,As Culturally Important  As Il Trovatore,"Our attitude to film scares me. It is important, vitally important. As time goes on our disregard for the medium becomes more and more dangerous as great movies become forgotten. The work of The Marx Brothers is a good example of this. 70 years ago these men were massive, massive stars. OK so their last movie, Duck Soup hadn't done so well, but this was a big hit. It's a fantastic movie that contains two of the finest comedy moments ever committed to film, and yet of the 5 people who watched it with me, only one had seen it before. At school we're told to read Shakespeare's comedies, something by one of the Brontes and probably some poetry written by someone shot at the Somme. However did we once get told about The Marx Brothers, or the genius of Citizen Kane? No. Like riding a bike, how to pop spots and the fact that drinking White Lightning really isn't a good idea, classic movies are something we have to learn for ourselves. That's why we all have a flawed film education, lets all get educated people, we should try watching movies made before Jaws! Now, unlike their earlier films A Night At The Opera actually HAS a plot! It's simple and is in effect a romance, with the Brothers banding together to help out the two young lovers come together. In truth it is little more than a rickety chair upon which to drape the splendid set pieces and jokes that make up the Brothers anarchic style of comedy, but it's there. All you really need to know is that the two young lovers are Opera singers and it ends up with the Brothers doing everything they can to ruin opening night at the New York Opera. Then comes the comedy.Oh lord what comedy. In the three Marx Brothers you have room for such amazing routines: Groucho is the master of the quick one liners, Chico butchers the language with his con-artist character, and Harpo is sheer energy, like a released manifestation of the id. These elements all combine to create magic on screen. I simply do not have the ability to describe the moments they produce during this movie other than in the broadest of strokes. From Harpo wearing more clothes than anyone else in the world, to Groucho and Chico tearing up both a contract and the words with which it is written. From the brothers fitting more people into a ships cabin than you could think possible to running rings around a bumbling policeman, literally. This all culminates with the three brothers destroying a grand performance of Il Trovatore using every devious trick in the book."
68,A Night at the Opera,8,17 October 2006,A Wonderful Night With Verdi And Harpo,"I genuinely enjoyed this. Here the slapstick and musical elements are much better integrated into the fabric of the movie than 'Duck Soup'.And what music! Introducing Verdi is always welcome in my book...but look at Harpo's tour de force piano and harp performances. He is the real star of this movie, playing impossible Rachmaninov bits -- as a mimed joke to children! -- and as a warmup....then he pulls us in with a virtuoso harp solo, entrancing both us and the observers within the movie.As for the 'musicals within' sung by Jones and Carlisle, I found this quite charming and a worthy central value. That the slapstick skits serve to resolve the 'inner' story at the same time as the larger movie speaks of Wood's directorial control. It's not perfect -- some of the skits plainly misfire -- but give it chance and allow yourself to be swept along."
69,A Night at the Opera,9,8 June 2006,"Not the Marxes' greatest, but more than merely good.","A Night at the Opera is a more than just a good Marx Brothers movie. It has a number of the Marxes' best known classic routines. It has a script by Kaufman and Ryskind, the authors of The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers. It's a movie to watch. I can't, however, argue it is the brothers' best film and it surprises me why people say it is, although they often qualify the rating with ""arguably."" The Paramount films tend to be derided because of their low budget look, which, obviously, an MGM movie isn't going to have. And all these things make it as appealing as the lesser of the Paramount films. It is not as bad as the MGM films that follow it. Not even close.But it repeatedly violates the rules of the Marx Universe, or sets up new ones. Groucho now can be sweetly sentimental toward a brokenhearted ingenue instead of simply saying, ""Congratulations, I know you'll be absolutely miserable with this man."" He can also be thrown down stairs, giving the punch (or is it kick) line to a minor player. It's as disturbing as when he cries ""Help! Help!"" in A Night in Casablanca. Groucho doesn't yell for help. He can face a gangster about to shoot him and still make jokes. Or rather, he could.The brothers are at the mercy of chaos, rather than the creators of it (The Stateroom Scene). When they disrupt the opera and become the masters again, the movie is good. Otherwise, it feels strange.Zeppo is missed. It's easy to see how the part that later became Allan Jones's could have been originally crafted for Zeppo. When Jones works with all the brothers, he tries to capture Zeppo's synchronicity with them, but can't do it. Jones is a romantic lead. Anyone with a good voice could do this part.It's also strange to see the three brothers allies so quickly. In the Paramount films there is always the Groucho-Zeppo duo and the Harpo-Chico duo, both of which eventually become integrated together. Harpo and Chico still begin knowing each other here, but Groucho seems just an absurd appendage to their universe. But he still connects to it far better than Jones does.The romantic subplot sucks. Perhaps not as badly as Polly and Bob in Cocoanuts, and perhaps that's part of the problem. The subplot is passable enough to make it legitimate, not something the brothers can ignore or work around. It drives them. They are also driven by it in Animal Crackers, but there the plot was not reuniting lovers but being part of and so exposing the hypocrisy of high society. There is no satire in Opera. The triangle of Kitty Carlisle, Jones, and Walter Woolf King is essentially dramatic and it makes Opera feel less like an out and out Marx comedy.I could also do without Alone and Cosi-Cosa. Time for the skip button.It's geared to appeal to the same people who found Duck Soup awful. Those people aren't really around anymore and the intelligence in Duck Soup is largely missing in Opera, to the latter film's detriment.Again, though, I think it ranks with the lesser Paramounts. There's Chico and Groucho's contract scene. There's Harpo bringing down all the wrong opera backdrops on Walter Woolf King. There's laughter far more continuous than it is in the later MGM films. And it is a handsomely produced film. Thalberg was no slouch.But the brothers were Marxian anarchists of another kind. Until we get to the final opera scene, there's not a lot of wildness. We are seeing the brothers transformed into something other than what they started as. It's not happened enough yet to matter, or spoil the film, but it does take Opera to a lower ranking than Duck Soup or Animal Crackers. It has the weaknesses those other two films (especially Duck Soup) do not."
70,A Night at the Opera,9,9 March 2006,Marx Brothers and Music: A Good Combination,"A stream of consciousness, anything goes, Marx Brothers rampage. It is filled with jokes and sight gags. Harpo always has that leg up in the air, like an amorous cocker spaniel. The scene in the state room on the ship. The story of how they got to America: ""We got three fourths of the way across, ran out of gas, and had to go back."" It is imaginative and crass. They were certainly the masters of insensitivity; mid twentieth century bullies; who find nothing sacred. I heard once that Margaret DuMont, who was Groucho's constant foil, never really got the jokes or even knew they were jokes. Because opera is frequented by members of wealthy society, these people become the perfect targets because of their pomposity. The Marx Brothers knew that their audience of the time was perfectly willing to see the upper classes brought to their knees. If I have a favorite Brothers movie, it would be ""Animal Crackers,"" but for me, this is second on the list."
71,A Night at the Opera,7,19 January 2006,"""Don't wake him up, he's got insomnia, he's trying to sleep it off.""","The Marx Brothers are at it again, this time with the New York opera scene as a backdrop, but when did high society ever stop their zaniness before? Groucho's character is Otis B. Driftwood, conspiring to get the wealthy Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont, who else?) to contribute two hundred thousand dollars to the arts. The story begins in Italy, as promoter Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman) attempts to sign a famous opera singer, but his intentions will go awry when Fiorello and Tomasso (Chico and Harpo) ally themselves with Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones), an unknown singer looking for a break.The film offers it's share of vintage Marx Brothers routines, among them the famous (or infamous) stateroom scene, the sanity clause bit, and the wild chase on stage at the New York concert hall. The main surprise for this viewer was the appearance of Kitty Carlisle as singer Rosa. My only recollection of Miss Carlisle was as a panelist on ""What's My Line"" and ""To Tell The Truth"" in the 1950's/60's, and did not realize her talent extended to operatic arias. The movie's sub plot involves a romance between Rosa and Jones' character Baroni.""A Night at the Opera"" is visually a frenetic, high energy Marx Brothers romp, though in retrospect I think I miss Groucho's insightful one liners, especially the ones you catch up with a few moments after they're spoken. There's not enough of them here, taking the film down a bit from the reputation it's earned as their best film. Still, it's vintage Marx Brothers and worth a sit down, with a bit of fractured culture thrown in for good measure."
72,A Night at the Opera,10,29 December 2005,My favorite movie ever of any kind,"I think this movie has everything that makes a movie great in just the right amounts. It's hilariously funny throughout with some truly classic scenes. It has an actual plot, moves at a steady pace, the good guys win in the end, and the music is exceptional. Most of the reviews I have read are quite favorable, but I have to wonder about some of the criticism. There are a few who just didn't like it, and that's merely a matter of taste, but I was surprised to see complaints about the opera music since it was after all a movie centered around opera singers. I'm no fan of opera, but I like the way older movies are able to develop characters and stories and make you really want the predictable outcome to occur. If it takes having opera singers singing, then so be it. The songs generally just define the goodness of the good guy (Ricardo) and the arrogance of the bad guy (Laspari). It seems most modern movies have the same formulaic plots, but when the predictable outcome occurs, it's just that, predictable."
73,A Night at the Opera,,9 January 2006,Great comedy with typically thin plot,"Never one to miss a business opportunity to make money, Otis B. Driftwood takes a break from fleecing the wealthy Mrs Claypool to represent an opera singer represented by manger Fiorello. However when he boards a steamer to return to the US he doesn't know that Fiorello, Tomasso and Ricardo have stowed away in his trunk. Arriving in America disguised as three famous aviators, they try to evade arrest while getting Ricardo together with his love Rosa.There is a plot here but if you have come to this film because you are deeply interested in the young love between Rosa and Ricardo then you've probably missed the point and don't have much of a sense of humour. I say this because really the narrative is a very thin nail on which all manner of Marx Brothers hilarity is hung and this is the reason for coming to and loving this film. Whether it is the classic discussion over the contract clauses, the cramped cabin, the room switching or the chaotic backstage at the opera, it is all energetic and enjoyable. Personally I found the physical humour to be secondary to the sharp tongue and wisecracks of Groucho but many will enjoy both equally. The musical moments do slow the film down somewhat because I wanted the quips to come back in favour of the music (although mostly the music is impressive  just slightly unwanted.The cast are dominated by Groucho and it is a very welcome thing. He is wonderful and iconic throughout, cracking jokes across the whole film and delivering each line with the style that he will be forever famous for. Chico is good as he often works the routines well with Groucho but he is never his equal. Harpo is an acquired taste and personally I think he is OK when he is a side issue but anytime the film calls on him to do stand alone clowning (at the breakfast table) then it doesn't work, although there is no denying his musical talent. Carlisle and Jones are uninspiring matinée style performers and they bored me whenever the film checked in with them to move the story on. Support from Rumann, King and Dumont is good though and they all convincingly react to Groucho.Overall a wonderful comedy if you like the Marx brothers  Groucho in particular. The plot may be a very thin excuse for the comedy but when the comedy is as strong as this then it is easy to forgive. All in all, a classic film that is the sort of thing you want to force your kids to watch just to start them off right."
74,A Night at the Opera,,17 September 2001,Worse than its reputation.,"This does not live up to its reputation as a top Marx Brothers movie.  To make the Marxes commercially attractive (their previous effort, the great `Duck Soup,' had been a box office bomb, go figure), MGM decided to make them conventionally sympathetic characters.  Ho ho!  But it was a shrewd move for its time - `Night at the Opera' was a big hit.  Yet the Marxes went from artists to average 1930s comedians.  So that Harpo, Groucho and Chico expend energy, in appalling fashion, trying to help the lovebirds, Kitty Carlisle and Alan Jones.  To get the audience on Harpo's side, they have the villain repeatedly beat him with a stick. THEN whip him!  Lou Costello never suffered such indignities.  The comedy routines suffer.  You no longer get the idea the Brothers are spirits from another dimension.  Instead, they could play double bills with the Three Stooges.  The famous stateroom scene still works.  There are a few chuckles.  But Groucho's lines have lost their bite; and Harpo just makes faces.  Chico is a vaudevillian with a broad Italian accent.  And just try and sit through those dreadful musical numbers without screaming."
75,A Night at the Opera,,13 August 2002,Why are the Marx Brothers so popular?,"Scene from `A Night at the Opera':  In a nightclub Groucho says `would you like to rumba?' to a society dowager.  As she stands up expectantly and exclaims `why yes,' he says, `well pick a rumba from 1 to 5.'  Now aside from this being only one out of a whole series of incredibly lame jokes that pepper a script that was supposedly co-authored by George S. Kaufman (on a very bad day, apparently), what further kills the humor here is the woman's mingled expression of hurt, bewilderment and anger as she sits down again. This is indicative of Marx Brothers' comedy in general: juvenile anarchy with a total disregard for anyone else's feelings.  I suppose a lot of their popularity is based on their rebellion against authority and societal convention, but while watching `Opera' I found myself in the strange position of identifying with the stony and irritated reactions of those who are the butt of the brothers' disruptive pranks and insults.  It's like sitting in a schoolroom trying to learn something while the class clowns behind you are doing their best to make damn sure you don't.  Producer Irving Thalberg tried to soften their abrasive style with an insipid plot in which the brothers try to browbeat an opera house into giving two lovers a chance to sing in `Il Trovatore' by making a shambles of the production. However, it doesn't really help and when Chico and Harpo perform a mini-concert for a group of happy, laughing children, the results are cloying and tiresome in the extreme.  In short, I did not laugh once during this movie."
76,A Night at the Opera,,14 December 2003,"Not the funniest Marx Brothers ever, but still get some guffaws.","Though I always claim to myself as being quite knowledgeable in movies, there are some films that I never got around to see. One of them was a Groucho Marx movie. The snippets I know from the madcap genius is quotes from his many films, and nostalgic clip shows which show the golden age of movies. So I decided to watch a Marx brothers movie. The only one that was available was ""A Night At The Opera"". After I watched it, I felt disappointed like a kid who opened his presents expecting a Buzz Lightyear, but got socks instead. It was not that there sketches were not funny, since there was a lot of wacky and zany scenes. However I felt like it was a variety show with music and laughter, rather than an all out craziness, like the Abrahams and Zuckers' movies, like Airplane or Naked Gun. The plot goes like this; Groucho Marx tries to make a quick buck when he hears that a young tenor can be brought up for a extraordinary price. So him and his crazy friends Chico and Harpo tries to persuade the manager of the opera company to  sign up a young talent. However this young talent is also so deeply in love with one of the operatic shows. Anyway with the one liners of Groucho Marx, the non political correct Italian stereotype of  Chico Marx and the muted miming madness of Harpo Marx, they achieve their goals in a very manic way.The acting in general was just average, however it would have to be said that Groucho Marx had most of the best lines. The only thing I dont enjoy about this movie, is the concept of musical numbers in the movie. It seemed to be out of place in the movie, unless the songs were meant to be a parody or satirical. However, this could be commonplace in the movies of those times, and I am looking back in hindsight. In conclusion, the movie was a funny film, but it could do much better."
77,A Night at the Opera,6,20 October 2006,Fun Marx Bros. film with lots of music...,"With KITTY CARLISLE and ALLAN JONES in the romantic leads, it's no wonder this Marx Bros. outing has as much music as it does. Probably a good thing or the gags that come fast and furious would be too much over the film's running time.Once again, MARGARET DUMONT is the butt of Groucho's most outrageous observations as he proposes to make her the patron of the arts for the opera house. She takes all of his humor in good stride (as always), making the perfect ""straight man"" for his jokes. HARPO and CHICO get plenty of opportunity to shine in a number of slapstick behind-the-scenes moments. The famous stateroom scene and the ""party of the first part"" routine are the funniest highlights. WALTER KING demonstrates comic skill in a good supporting role.As for Carlisle and Jones, they get a chance to show their vocal skills although tenor Jones is still a bit stiff as an actor. As usual, the romantic interest is just a filler between the Marx Bros. routines.Summing up: Margaret Dumont's exasperated patron of the arts is one of her funniest roles--and the film is one of the best for the brothers, a good mixture of music and their brand of slapstick fun."
78,A Night at the Opera,,9 June 2004,"Not DUCK SOUP, but it saved the Marx Brothers' careers","To fully appreciate the significance of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA to the Marx Brothers' and their fans of today, one has to understand at bit of history. DUCK SOUP, the film they made just prior to this one, may be considered by today's audience as their funniest ever, but at the time it was a box office flop and led to the Marxes' dismissal from Paramount. Irving Thalberg of MGM rescued their careers by providing them a formulaic movie that allowed them to work their lunacy around an actual plot (ie, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl plus the Marxes versus a villain or two), making A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and A DAY AT THE RACES two films that had a little something for everyone.  It literally saved their careers at the time, and Groucho Marx was quoted in that regard many, many times. The tragedy of the whole thing is that Thalberg died young and his influence is felt only through RACES.  The films made after RACES pale in comparison. Louis B. Mayer, the head of MGM, could care less about the Marx Brothers, and while Thalberg made sure they had the best writers and support staff, Mayer threw them to the wolves.  Who knows what else the Marxes may have given us had Thalberg lived. So yes, some of the ""dramatic"" scenes in NIGHT and RACES may seem a bit contrived and over the top for today's audiences, and the music may be something that you ""tolerate"".  But without it, there may never have been Otis B. Driftwood, the Stateroom Scene, Mrs. Claypool, Hugo Z. Hackenbush (RACES), Tootsie-Frootsie Ice-a Crim (RACES). Take these films in the context of the times and the situation and enjoy them.  Let joy be unconfined!  Let there be dancing in the streets, drinking in the saloons and necking in the parlors.  Play, Don!"
79,A Night at the Opera,8,7 February 2004,Worth watching but NOT their best,"Enjoyable but the jokes are very predictable and you see them coming a mile away plus the lead actors are just too hammy. My favorite by far is THE BIG STORE followed by A DAY AT THE RACES. Don Lessnau, Redford, MI"
80,A Night at the Opera,,17 January 2000,The last great Marx Brother film,"After ""A Night at the Opera,"" the first film the brothers made for their MGM contract, the formula began to go downhill. No one is really sure what happened....Perhaps it was the absense for desent storylines, perhaps it was the absense of a desent straight man after Zeppo hit the road, or perhaps the brothers were just getting old. At any rate, this is without a doubt one of their funniest pictures, but unfortunately, it was the last film which would truly have the right to be called a masterpiece. While their next film, ""A Day At the Races,"" contained some very funny scenes, it contained some very bad ones as well, and that formula of bad comedy would stick. As a result, this is your last chance to see the Brothers, the greatest comedy team in the history of film, in their top form.""Opera"" features Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and their new straight man Allan Jones trying to make it big in the opera business and their crazy antics in order to meet their goals. Jones is a tenor who they're trying to make famous, Groucho is trying to make it big as his agent, and Harpo and Chico are just kind of along for the ride.The goods: Great timing and great moments in comedy. The stageroom scene from the ocean liner is one of the funniest ever, and the plotline as able to keep the Brothers in check enough for there to be plenty of comedy for them, and plenty of romance for Jones. Nice piano and harp solos from Chico and Harpo as well, respectively. The not-so-goods: Well, there are a few. The first is the miscast of Allan Jones as the love interest. For the Marx Brother forumla to work, you need these four basic functions, one of which is the straight man with the love interest (see my ""Horse Feathers"" comment for a more thorough explanation). Jones was not the right choice for the role. His over-sappiness and his cliched charms sent me many times banging my head up against the wall, missing Zeppo tremendously. Another negative: Not enough of Margaret Dumont, often regarded as the fifth Marx Brother. For a woman who is so often considered Groucho's ultimate sidekick, she's barely in it.Other than that, the film is very effective in its goals: To send the viewer laughing until their insides split. Watch it and admire it, and respect it for its rightful title as the last of the great Marx Brother films.""This is an outrage. If I were you, I wouldn't pay it!""*** out of ****"
81,A Night at the Opera,6,7 January 2018,I tried to like it...,"This movie is in the AFI Top 100 movies of all time so I decided to give it a go. I unfortunately was rather bored watching it. The most memorable part of the movie was the piano and harpsichord scene. It had the comedy in the beginning and then drifted toward some beautiful harpsichord playing. The transition was perfectly executed in that scene. The rest of the movie fell flat however. A lot of the comedy doesn't hold up too well nowadays and there was too much singing. I'm not a fan of opera singing in the first place and it you are like that too, you may get annoyed. The story was alright but it had a cheesy ending. It was so cheesy, that it was actually one of the few times that I laughed (even though you weren't supposed to).Overall - Wouldn't recommend this film nowadays, especially for the younger generation. Charlie Chaplin's films has comedy that holds up better than this one. I have no doubt it was good for it's time, but some films just do not age too well."
82,A Night at the Opera,9,30 December 2017,The Marx Brothers signs their MGM Contract... with Zanity Clause... albeit setting a precedent announcing their lesser movies...,"""Half the laughs and twice the money"" that was Irwin Thalberg's equation when he hired the Marx Brothers for their new MGM contract and it sure paid off if the first movie was the 1935 classic, ""A Night at the Opera"", one of their best, if not the second best after ""Duck Soup"", or third after ""Animal Crackers"". This is basically ""Duck Soup"" with a plot, with more heart and less cynicism and let's admit it, a few sappy and musical moments... but so few, I didn't think they spoiled the enjoyment.Before the MGM, Paramount consecrated the Marx Brothers as the new sound of comedic talent, proof that humor needed the talkies, and after Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd, there was room for a chatterbox like Groucho Marx, a wise guy like Chico, and a honking maniac (who knew how to handle silent humor) like Harpo. But it's all in the persona of Groucho Marx, his wisecracking that would later inspire Bugs Bunny, the way he constantly teases a bewildered Margaret Dumont who easily loses the track of his machine-gun firing insults or the sense of natural anarchy and mayhem caused by the three siblings.Intelligence, subversion, chaos, that was the Marx Brothers before Thalberg felt the need to tone it down in order to match the more politically correct requirement of the audience. Yes, those were the Code's days and ""Duck Soup"" was perhaps too subversive and politically loaded for its own good. So the point was to change the formula and not rely too much on their unpredictable behavior but use a plot as a clothesline where to hang their antics and weird behavior... make them more sympathetic, Harpo would become like a child figure rather than his Benny Hill precursor persona and the brothers will always serve the interest of a young romantic couple, against a generally one-dimensional bad guy. That was the formula of the MGM period, being ""foils"" that didn't fool us, it worked to a certain degree, but in ""A Night in the Opera"", despite the sappy romantic interludes and musical ""fillers"", the film is still in the same vein of zaniness than ""Duck Soup"". I did the counting, there are exactly five minutes of the ""Alone"" meowing, I mean, singing, ten minutes of ""Cosi Cosa"" and Chico and Harpo playing their trademark instruments, and the romantic moments between Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle or the bad guy, don't exceed twenty minutes. So basically, in a runtime of ninety minutes, you have seventy minutes of fun, and sequences as classic one another.Think about it, the restaurant scene with Dumont, the contract scene with Chico, the iconic room filling sequence where each new guest inspired a new hilarious comment from Marx, that ""you have everything"" 'no one ever complained"" exchange that got past the censor, and the great spectacular finale at the opera. 1935 was the year Donald trolled the band concert by playing ""Turkey in the Straw"" during the William Tell Overture, but I'm not sure if it beats ""the Baseball Music"" playing at the Scala. But recollecting the great moments of ""A Night at the Opera"" isn't interesting, the problem is that the film marks both a new era for the siblings but a sort of beginning of the end.If we except ""A Day At the Races"", the other movies don't play the same league for the simple reason that the formula could only depend on the inspiration in the comedic moments and the more films they made, the less gags and the sappier the romance went. Even in ""A Night at the Opera"", you're tempted to skip the parts while ""Duck Soup"" is perfect from beginning to end. The Brothers were so ahead of their time they had to serve as foils for plot elements that ruined their films and totally forgettable. Imagine if they could have done similar movies even unsuccessful, the treasure it would have been.It was French comedic actor Louis de Funès who said at the peak of his career that he wouldn't accept anymore to be directed, advised yes, but director not. According to him, a comic actor alone could understand the range of his talent and many comedians didn't get their deserved success because they followed the instructions of directors who knew nothing. It was his perception (and agreeable) that the comics were perhaps the only auteur in acting and any interference could ruin the intended effects. I don't think this really applies in the case of ""A Night at the Opera"", even Groucho Marx admitted it was a wise choice.But as good as it is, the film sets a precedent and provides the ludicrous idea that a Marx Brothers movie could be a vehicle for a banal romance, meant to promote two MGM stars. With a reasonable timing and good 'interludes', maybe, but who would believe the audience came to watch anyone but the Marx Brothers?"
83,A Night at the Opera,10,6 February 2015,Great Marx Brothers antics on stage and off,"In their earliest movies, the Marx Brothers were at their best and funniest. The scripts were crisp and very witty, the antics were hilarious, and there were very good plots that held it all together. ""A Night at the Opera"" is one such film, and among my favorites. Groucho plays Otis B. Driftwood, a stage producer and director. Chico plays Florello, a stage handyman, and Harpo plays Tomasso, and friend of Chico's. Kitty Carlisle plays Rosa, and Allan Jones plays Ricardo. They are the romance for the film. Two other roles are excellent. Margaret Dumont plays Mrs. Claypool, and Sig Ruman is over-the-top funny as Gottlieb.The story is a great one that lends itself perfectly for the type of antics the Marx Brothers excel at. Naturally, the boys get to use their musical talents  and they were very talented on instruments. The movie is funny throughout, and it has a Marx Brothers trademark sequence of grand antics. Chico and Harpo had quite the athletic ability as well  as seen in the hilarious stage antics. Other reviewers discuss the setting, and I don't want to say more about the plot. It unfolds wonderfully and hilariously. Here are some samples of dialog to when one's appetite for watching ""A Night at the Opera.""Florello, ""Shhh! Don't wake him up. He's got insomnia. He's trying to sleep it off.""Sgt. Henderson (played by Robert O'Connor), ""Say, what's that bed doing here?"" Otis, ""I don't see it doing anything.""Florello, ""What'' I say?"" Otis, ""Tell them you're not here."" Florello, ""Suppose they don't believe me."" Otis, ""They'll believe you when you start talking.""Sgt. Henderson, ""I notice the table is set for four."" Otis, ""That's nothing. My alarm clock is set for eight. That doesn't prove a thing.""Sgt. Henderson, ""What's this?"" Otis, ""Why, it's a fire escape. And, uh, that's a table. And this is a room. And there's the door leading out. I wish you'd use it. I .. 'I vahndt to be alone.'""This is a movie guaranteed to keep one in stitches. It's a great addition to any film library."
84,A Night at the Opera,10,13 December 2014,The Most Fun You'll Ever Have at the Opera,"Wise-cracking con-man Groucho Marx (as Otis B. Driftwood) wants matronly Margaret Dumont (as Mrs. Claypool) to invest a fortune in the opera. Already involved in musical theater are Italian manager Chico Marx (as Fiorello) and mute dresser Harpo Marx (as Tomasso). They team up to represent handsome opera singer Allan Jones (as Riccardo Baroni). As usual, the plot is secondary to the Marx Brothers' antics. In this case, the story compliments the comedy team very well. Moving to upscale MGM, the brothers and producer Irving Thalberg wisely hired Marx regulars George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind to sweeten, then write the screenplay. They were the gold standard Marx Brothers writers and this film contains some of the team's most memorable scenes and routines...""A Night at the Opera"" begins a more polished, less crazed, Marx era. More dependent on wit and one-liners, Groucho's shtick made the transition better than his brothers. Still, everything essential to the formula is preserved, including unfairly criticized non-comic brother Zeppo, who left the group after their previous ""Duck Soup"". Zeppo's shoes are nicely filled by Mr. Jones. Likewise maligned, the musical interludes serve to break up the comedy and pace the skits in a feature film. It's great to see ""To Tell the Truth"" game panelist Kitty Carlisle as the young ingénue. Walter Woolf King is a splendid villain. Regulars Sig Ruman and Ms. Dumont round out perfect support. In this case, listening to opera music with the Marx Brothers is the most fun you're ever going to have at the opera.********** A Night at the Opera (11/8/35) Sam Wood ~ Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, Harpo Marx, Allan Jones"
85,A Night at the Opera,,9 December 2014,Verdi Will Never Be The Same,"Three zany con men sabotage an opera company to promote the careers of two talented singers.The great WC Fields said the only act he couldn't follow in Vaudeville was the Marx Bros. Here, you can see why. Their loopy chaos shatters all formal structures, high and low. Whether it's the high-falutin' Mrs. Claypool (Dumont) or the lowly city cops, all goes into the comedy grinder. There's more plot than usual, with the sketches neatly integrated. Of course, there has to be boring romantic interludes ( Jones & Carlisle) so everyone can catch their breath. For me, the highpoints are always Groucho's witty digs at poor uncomprehending Dumont. It's like two worlds speaking different languages bumping into each other. Shouldn't forget Sig Rumann as flustered impresario Gottlieb, who has to watch his big plans get chewed up Marx style. Plus, I sure hope they paid those stunt doubles triple-time for their great work in the boffo climax. Anyhow, it's a big MGM production giving our anarchic trio all their wacko talents would ever need."
86,A Night at the Opera,8,20 November 2014,the best after Paramount,"is it DUCK SOUP or A NIGHT AT THE OPERA? it sure is not HORSE FEATHERS or THE BIG STORE? OK.yes, this is THE Marx film for ""family entertainment"" - has it all. very funny scenes, Marxes all fired up. even good music, which a reviewer here adroitly says is overdone.in this Reviewers' mind, it can never compare to DUCK SOUP as a ""comedy"". the 1933 film is nearly perfect as such. even if NIGHT lost most of the music, the Marx characters are now nice guys who help the lovers. they are so freaking nice that even Margaret Dumont, Groucho's love interest in the war picture, is not really needed! think of how important she was to DUCK SOUP! NIGHT is probably the best film to take slapstick artists and tone them down./ we all know what happened to Laurel and Hardy when they switched to the ""bigs""; what happened to Abbott and Costello, from day one on the sound stage. (when their TV show hit the waves, fans could see what they were missing, in those overlong, sentimental films, for 10 years! all about ""escapism""! Thalberg thought audiences needed rest time between laffs. so he added music.very much a matter of taste. the DVD is worth owning. but beware it may come with ""lesser"" MB vehicles, hard to sit through."
87,A Night at the Opera,9,3 November 2014,The Marx Brothers Sign with MGMBut Remove the Sanity Clause,"Much Thought and Trepidation went into the Decision by the Marx Brothers and MGM as to Why such a Great Film like Duck Soup (1933) was a Flop. MGM's Thalberg Insisted it was the Incoherence and the Lack of Plot that Audiences Required and the Marx's went Along with Him and His Formula. The Rest is History.This Film Became the Brothers Biggest Hit and Sustained Their Career. Thalberg May have been Right, and the Moviegoers of the 1930's Liked a Lot of Singing and Dancing with Their Comedy, but Truth be Told. It was just a Fad. In Retrospect the Dated Love Songs and Romantic Subplots are Hardly the Reason Anyone After the Fact went Back to View these Comedic Gems. Today, Blasphemous as it May Be, it is Common for Modern Audiences to Say, ""I fast forward through the Songs."" So it is the Zany Brothers that Make These Things Classics. Their Irreverence, Timing, Wit, and Overall Hilarious Routines that Make a Marx Brothers Movie. In this One They Even Make Opera Somewhat Tolerable. It is Considered One Their Best and Some Say it is the Best. Along with Duck Soup it is the One that is Universally Touted as the Cream of the Brothers Crop.The Opera, is in Fact, a Great Place for the Marxes to be Unleashed as They Rip it to Shreds Along with Contracts and Clothes. It is a Slick Film that Groucho Said is His Favorite.But for Pure Marx Brothers Without the MGM Mix of Music and RomanceSome Prefer Duck Soup as Well as Some of the Others Done at Paramount."
88,A Night at the Opera,10,30 January 2014,The best comedy movie of all time,"If you have kids, you have to introduce them to the Marx Bros and this one and a Day at the Races are the best for that. The dialog is super clever and meant for adults but the kids eat up the action. They will have better senses of humor and will more likely grow up to be better people. A Night at the Opera is just plain fun. If you think its not funny then go back and lay down in your casket. The Marx Bros did to opera what it deserves. The contract scene should be a standard in any law course. You can go on and on. A true masterpiece. I love Duck Soup but this is the great one and there never has been anything close. I have seen it 30 times, know much of it by heart and every time I see it, I laugh. And I always feel a lot better afterward."
89,A Night at the Opera,7,18 December 2013,Tomfoolery On A Boat,"A Night At The Opera inspires memories of Kitty Carlisle and Alan Jones as 2 charismatic young lovers. Their, uh, operatic romance was a highlight of 1930s cinema, overshadowing everything else in this picture. Oh, but the movie was missing a key ingredient. The hilarious Zeppo Marx had retired from acting after his one-of-a-kind work in Duck Soup. A pity.Okay, reverse everything in that first paragraph and you'll have the truth. Nobody cares about Carlisle or Jones, probably not even Carlisle or Jones. As for Zeppo, the day he gave up his career as a thespian, the film world's yawn was very loudly indifferent. No, this picture is all about the zaniness of the non-Zeppo Marx Brothers (Groucho, Chico and Harpo). The former vaudevillians overshadowed everyone else who ever appeared in their films. Groucho's oft-naughty wordplay and Harpo's silent antics are legendary. Chico never got enough credit for playing off his 2 brothers as well as he did.You can't talk about A Night At The Opera for even 2 minutes without bringing up the infamous stateroom sequence. The 3 Marxes, various workmen, maids and other hangers-on, all crowd into one small room on an ocean liner. Why they're all in there and how the situation resolves itself won't be revealed here. It's funny and it's been imitated by dozens of movies and TV shows in the years since A Night At The Opera came out. You probably recognize it even if you haven't seen this movie.Was that scene and the Marx Brothers typical insanity enough to make this movie worthy of being on the American Film Institute's Top 100 list in 2007? It's a dubious choice, especially if your feeling is that a little of Groucho goes a long way. The piano/harp scene by Chico and Harpo is a great one, but it stops the, uh, story cold. So, no, A Night At The Opera is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but it's not without its charm...and it has Carlisle and Jones! Remember them? Oh. Right. No one does.If you got anything at all out of this quickie review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the ""Podcasts"" section for our 18-minute Night At The Opera 'cast...and many others. Or find us on Itunes under ""The Top 100 Project""."
90,A Night at the Opera,9,20 October 2013,The Marx on Top of their Game,"The comic timing of the one-liner is a lost art, and there are very few in the cinematic field that has that special delivery.A Night at the Opera should be the how-to guide for all aspiring actors that want to pursue the skill. But it's more than just the quick-paced jokes and subtle innuendo, Night at the Opera is arguably the most complete Marx Brothers film as we get a combination of opera, romance, comedy, music, and best of all each Brother having their chance to shine on the big screen. With a plot to loosely tie in all the mayhem this is one of the best films of the early cinema era.This movie follows the brothers playing a manager, a dresser, and a good friend of an aspiring singer running into each other as an opera in New York is about to be underway. Unlike most Marx Brothers movies which usually featured a take-no-prisoners approach, this time the chaos is unveiled to combat the villains in the story. This gives the Marx Brothers an actual dosage of humility and allows us to actually root for them as opposed to feel sorry for all the innocents that get trampled by their insanity.Like the best of comedies, you get a little bit of everything: dialogue humor, physical humor, subtle humor, visual humor, and of course all the hilarious innuendo of Groucho Marx. And although the romantic subplot and the operatic moments might be a bit much, it at least gives us a chance to breathe and relax after the machine gunfire of jokes that the Brothers can through in a limited amount of time. There is clearly a better director/writing combination to catch the Marx lightning in celluloid.The talent of the Marx Brothers is on full display here, and if you ever want to truly see what they are capable of, this film is their best example. Groucho's comic timing is amongst the best in film history. Harpo and Chico are excellent with the physical stunts and can play a mean piano. And just wait until you see Harpo have his fun with a harp in the middle of a musical interlude.Not just a great comedy, but one of the best in the history of the medium. A Night in the Opera starts out strong, rushes through with great bit after great bit, and finishes off with a great climax that displays excellent cinematography, stuntwork, and physical humor that has made the Marx Brothers a staple in American comedy. It ages well, holds up well, and remains a gem after all these years."
91,A Night at the Opera,10,22 January 2013,The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera is their triumphant first M-G-M feature,"Two years after making their last Paramount film, Duck Soup, the remaining Marx brothers-Groucho, Chico, and Harpo since Zeppo left-ended up at M-G-M after Chico played bridge with head of production Irving G. Thalberg and made a deal with him. With Thalberg on board, there would now be more production-meaning more story, more balance of comedy and drama with the juvenile leads and more music other than those of the Marx siblings. So now we have Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle as the romantic leads who we're supposed to care about and who are cared for by these brothers. They're actually not bad both acting and singing-wise even if you're not a fan of opera as I'm certainly not. We also have Walter Woolf King as the villain which is proved when he mistreats Harpo. But while there's not as much comedy as in their previous Paramount offerings, there's still enough of it that you laugh as much and as loud as in those earlier efforts. And not only does Groucho woo and insult Margaret Dumont delightedly again to wondrous effect here, Sig Ruman as an opera financier and Robert Emment O'Connor as a cop also provide their own great comic moments to the Marxes. Oh, and after being absent in Duck Soup, once again Chico plays his piano and Harpo his harp to entertaining results with the children watching and laughing at them an added pleasure. Oh, and Harpo also once again does his comic piano playing to good effect. Nothing more to add here except when watching the DVD, I highly recommend the Leonard Maltin commentary that accompanies this one as he provides great info throughout the picture including the missing opening sequence now considered lost. So, yeah, that's a high recommendation of A Night at the Opera."
92,A Night at the Opera,10,27 December 2012,Full 'Marx' for this Musical masterpiece.,"One of the first, and perhaps one of the best musical comedies to be made, Marx Brothers take us from Milan to New York by a ship that should have drowned with their tricks and feats.While 'Duck Soup' and 'Horse Feathers' are best remembered for the wordplay and slapstick, 'A Night at the Opera' is a Romantic-Musical-Comedy that also makes it one of the greatest comedies of all time.There are quite a good number of typical and never-seen-before feats of Marx Brothers that makes us wonder how such a thing was not just beyond ones imagination but also within ones implementation of the unimaginable, seven decades back.I doff my non-existent, imaginary hat to salute the masters of slapstick."
93,A Night at the Opera,7,28 April 2012,Largely successful transition...,"Now over 75 years old, it's somewhat easier to see where A Night At The Opera fits into the Marx Brothers canon. Although there was perhaps no Marx Brothers movie that was outright bad, the huge drop-off in quality that began with Room Service/At The Circus is more marked than the difference between this movie and Duck Soup.In Duck Soup we got the rarity of Harpo and Chico not having a musical interlude, Harpo just momentarily tinkering with an instrument. In A Night At The Opera both men are suddenly retooled as lovable, sympathetic scamps, complete with a horde of stagily-laughing children to cement their new-found family friendly appeal. Chico in particular gets a heavy character make-over, no longer on the look out for who he can cheat or rob, but who he can help and match make.And yet it's still a really good film. Sure, there have only maybe been three songs worth listening to in a Marx Brothers movie  I'm Against It; Hello, I Must Be Going and Lydia The Tattooed Lady  and that's unlikely to change here, even though the dreary ""Alone"" was the only hit from their movies. The ending also becomes reliant on stunt men to provide the laughs, a growing fixture with their MGM work. (Though Harpo did many of the stunts himself, even down to cutting his hands on the rope). But their restyling towards less anarchic events and plot-driven narratives can't disguise that it's still a very funny film.Nine years later they'd do another ""A Night..."" movie, wherein it was often Groucho's delivery that convinced his lines were funnier than they actually were. Here the lines are the equal of the performer, with some of their best material, including the much celebrated contract and cabin scenes. Considering the indignities heaped upon Laurel and Hardy when they began their own sojourn with MGM, there's no scene in this movie where the brothers are called upon to say that they think ""kids are swell"", or no scene where they're written completely out of character. Indeed, coming from the writers behind The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers, it carries over the grounding and knowledge of its subjects to really make the transition work.In hindsight, it's something of a shame that the Marx Brothers had to be declawed, and that less than 40% of their work contains their original characterisation. But if they had to make that transition, then A Night At The Opera was certainly the movie with which they should have done it. Should you care, I continue my look at the Marx Brothers with a review of A Day At The Races..."
94,A Night at the Opera,8,31 January 2012,Marx great!,"A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (MGM, 1935) directed by Sam Wood, re-introduces the Marx Brothers to the screen following their five years at the Paramount studio (1929-1933) to MGM, this being the start of a new beginning and the end to their wild world of comedy. It also brings forth their most popular comic foil of all, Margaret Dumont, from their Broadway to Paramount days, and the return to a formula story and time out for musical interludes either by the brothers or the romantic lovers originally done in their initial films of THE COCOANUTS (1929) and ANIMAL CRACKERS (1930). Aside from now being The Three Marx Brothers (Zeppo who has since retired), their characters have been toned down a bit, which helps. However, at MGM, with this, their best film for the studio, Groucho and Harpo become victims instead of instigators, with such notable scenes as Harpo employed as a dresser for an abusive opera tenor (Walter Wolfe King) who slaps, hits and uses a whip on him (at one point off camera) whenever getting out of line with his buffoonery, and Groucho, who always wins out in every situation physically and verbally, getting kicked down four flights of stairs, which indicates they are not always indestructible, yet remain in character from the old days whenever possible. Chico retains his wiseacre Italian character, remaining notably the same from his previous efforts, however, things will start to change not for the better for him and his brothers in the movies to follow.Plot summary: Introduction takes place in Milan, Italy, where Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) agrees to represent dowager Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) into society by arranging for her to invest $200,000 to Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman), director of the opera company so that he can afford to bring opera singers Rudolpho Lassparri (Walter King) and Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle) to New York City. Rudolpho loves Rosa, but she is more interested in Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones), an unknown singer working as a chorus-man, but with the help of Fiorelli (Chico), acting as his manager, and his partner, Tomasso (Harpo), the trio head for America by becoming stowaways on the S.S. Americus, hiding out in Driftwood's tiny stateroom in order for Ricardo to get his big chance as a singer. After Driftwood and his cronies arrive in at the Metropolitan Opera House, thanks to them in disrupting Rudolpho's performance that the art of opera will never be the same again.The musical program: ""Alone"" (sung by Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones) by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed; ""Cosi-Cosa"" (sung by Allan Jones) by Bronislau Kaper, Walter Jurmann and Ned Washington; ""All I Do is Dream of You"" (by Brown and Freed/piano solo by Chico Marx); ""Alone"" (harp solo by Harpo Marx); and selections from Il Trovatore by Guiseppi Verdi: ""Di quella pira,"" ""Miserere,"" ""Anvil Chorus,"" ""Stride la Vampa"" ""Strido lassu"" and ""Miserere."" Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle doing their duet, ""Alone,"" him on the pear and she from the boat dock, Chico's fast finger piano playing, and Harpo's harp solo in a serious manner as he performs to a little old lady (facial shadow front only) who looks on approvingly, may not be highlights, but are truly memorable moments."
95,A Night at the Opera,7,6 December 2011,Among the Marx best.,"Although it lacks a showstopper like ""Hello, I Must be Going"" from Animal Crackers, all of the hilarity and quality moments that mark the Marx's best work are here. Groucho's wild censor-testing disregard for the script and comments made to the camera bring laughs even 75 years later. The virtuosity of Harpo on harp and piano fits right in with the opera theme although his muteness is often frustrating. Often overlooked is the excellent straight-man work of Margaret Dumont and other in the film. And, of course, the film has the wild slapstick of their best work including the classic scene where dozens of characters are stuffed into a small staff room. Well worth the rental - bring the kids."
96,A Night at the Opera,,10 October 2011,funny movie,"Funny movie take time to watch Harpo is my favorite don't forget to watch the movie I hope you enjoy it My dad loved these movies My friend Pete just loves these funny movies be sure not to blink or your sure to miss something funny keep your eyes wide open My grandmother use to make old fashion pop kettle corn in the fire place with some good old hot chocolate and put our pajamas on get out our favorite chair from the attic and sit us down with our great grandfather and he would tell us all about the movie business, how the movies were made and how much the stars got paid for doing all the movies. He also said that it would take a long time for the director to film the movie, but usually they only had on shot to do it in. My great grandfather remembers many things working for paramount pictures and all the things he would have to hunt for, so the stars could wear during filming."
97,A Night at the Opera,8,8 September 2011,"""Ladies and gentlemen... I guess that takes in most of you...""","""A Night at the Opera"" is generally regarded as the second best Marx brothers comedy, right behind 1933's ""Duck Soup"". While there's some debate as to which is best, both are considered classics of American cinema.There is a story here but it's mainly just a backdrop for some inspired lunacy from the Marx brothers. In a nutshell, three zany individuals (ie. the Marx brothers) help a struggling Italian opera singer to pursue success (and romance) in New York.Acting-wise, the film's biggest asset is unquestionably the comedic prowess of the Marx brothers. Chico & Harpo also get to show off their considerable musical talent. Of the supporting players, Margaret Dumont provides an ideal comic foil for Groucho's one-liners while the young lovers, Allan Jones & Kitty Carlisle, are decent but unexceptional.In terms of visuals, Sam Wood's direction is mainly notable for his deft handling of the celebrated stateroom scene along with the big finale. As for the music, your appreciation will largely depend on how much you enjoy opera. However, the requisite Chico & Harpo musical interlude offers a welcome change of pace.Ultimately, I can't say whether or not this is a better film than ""Duck Soup"" because I haven't seen that film yet. What I can say is that ""A Night at the Opera"" contains countless witty lines & humorous situations. So, while the story isn't particularly strong, the movie is still quite enjoyable on the whole."
98,A Night at the Opera,8,2 January 2011,Opera + Marx Brothers=Mayhem,"When most of us think of the opera,we think of the people that are involved carrying themselves in a very straight laced manner,taking their craft very seriously with very little time for humor of any kind.The very idea of throwing The Marx Brothers into such a society is not only hysterical on paper,but it was carried out very well in A Night at the Opera.This is a fine showcase of talent for the Marxes,not only for their zany brand of comedy but for their musical talents as well,in particular Harpo's fine harp playing.They are supported well by Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones,and by the ever present Margaret Dumont,without whom the Marxes would have been just another run of the mill comedy act who would have faded away quickly.Watch and have a good time."
99,A Night at the Opera,7,6 November 2010,"Great film, apart from the singing.","My summary says it all. The Marx Brothers are great when they do their stuff, but when the singing starts, the story slows down to a stop, and its sad, the songs don't do much for me. The Marx Bros., always were the same in all their films, their humour is timeless, and will live for ever. I can not understand people not wanting to see their films just because they are in Black and White, that is no reason. The DVD that I have has a ""film historian"" giving us his expert opinion which I am also grateful for. All in all a great film. Just enjoy it. Then after you seen it, go and see all their other films. The only problem with the DVD is the sound could be polished up a little."
100,A Night at the Opera,7,27 July 2009,"Funny, but not the best Marx Brothers movie","Put me into the group that doesn't feel this is the funniest or best Marx Brothers film (I lean toward Monkey Business or Duck Soup as complete films). While I don't think it's the best of the Marx's work it is an often hysterical romp at the opera as Groucho and his brothers demolish all thought of sane behavior (After all there is no Sanity Clause). Containing some of the great routines, the contract negotiation, the welcoming to New York, the hotel room, the state room, the madness at the opera, the film to me never really comes together. Yes the lines and routines are funny, but the film jumps from bit to bit at times with little connection. In many of their other films the film plays as a whole and if there is an odd jump in logic (Duck Soup) the film still works as a whole. I don't think Night at the Opera works as anything other than a collection of loosely connected bits. And as sacrilegious as it may sound (I'm a life long card carrying Marxist of the Minnie's boys variety) I find the recent vintage remake, Brain Donors, a much funnier and more satisfying film. My lack of love is no reason not to see the film since when all else is said and done the film is funny no matter how you slice it."
101,A Night at the Opera,9,4 July 2009,Not Quite As Good As Everyone Says.,"The Marx Brothers ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935), directed by Sam Wood who would go on to direct another Marx Brothers picture, ""A Day at the Races"", and then on to serious films like ""For Whom the Bell Toles"", isn't quite as good as people say. Of course, it has such justly famous bits as the contract tearing scene, the state-room scene and the plain clothes detective searching Groucho's apartment for Chico, Harpo and Ricardo (Allan Jones), but the romance between Jones and Kitty Carlisle is down right boring, and if it wasn't for the Marx Brothers, the movie would be terrible. The songs as well are bland and operatic, and anyhow, songs in general are a disadvantage in a Marx Brothers film because you are there to see a comedy, not a musical. Still, their are some very funny moments, especially the first five minutes. Just don't expect it to be on the level of ""A Day at the Races""."
102,A Night at the Opera,8,14 June 2009,Harpo Marx: Liberace's template?,"I suppose musical ""stunt performers"" originated somewhere in Africa during prehistoric days. Liberace was the first I remember observing, somehow playing the piano backwards from under the keyboard, etc. However, it came as a revelation to see Harpo Marx (""Tomasso"" here) perform all kinds of tricks for the kids in steerage on a piano (including playing with limp fingers after ""slamming"" his hands with the cover). This, after Harpo replaced Chico (""Fiorello"" here) on the ivories, following his own virtuoso turn at his namesake instrument, the harp. Growing up watching Kitty Carlisle as a regular on the TV show TO TELL THE TRUTH, it also was intriguing to listen to her renditions as an opera soprano in this movie. Seeing Groucho waddling as ""Otis B. Driftwood"" is like the icing on the cake to top off A NIGHT AT THE OPERA."
103,A Night at the Opera,,8 November 2005,"""On account of you, I nearly heard the opera!""","""A Night at the Opera"" is a brilliant Marx Brothers comedy with plenty of fast-paced action, charming music, and witty wordplay. Bravo to the Kaufman & Ryskind team for the excellent screenplay (we finally have a Marx Bros. film with a considerable amount of STRUCTURE) and to director Sam Wood, even if he and the Brothers may not have enjoyed the smoothest of relationships. Thanks to the brilliance of the wunderkind producer Irving Thalberg, ""Opera"" is the first picture the Marx Bros. made at MGM following their string of five Paramount pictures. Zeppo was now out of the act, and the handsome Allan Jones provides a fine substitute for him in this film and in the next Marx Bros. feature, ""A Day at the Races"" (1937). Siegfried Rumann provides some fine comic support, perhaps without intending to do so, and Margaret Dumont once more becomes the constant butt of Groucho's jokes.Here are my favorite highlights from ""A Night at the Opera"" (don't read any further until you have seen it). Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) and Fiorello (Chico) ""negotiate"" a contract for an opera tenor, topped off with a ""sanity clause"" joke. Near the end, Driftwood, Fiorello, and Tomasso (Harpo) turn the opera into a complete shambles (""Take Me Out to the Ball Game,"" swinging on ropes, backdrops raised and lowered, etc.) until they can finagle their well-deserving friends Rosa (Kitty Carlisle) and Riccardo (Jones) into the lead roles. Perhaps the most well-known Marx Bros. gag is the crowded stateroom scene (""...and two hard-boiled eggs,"" reminds Fiorello). Groucho displays a rare moment of sentimentality when his character Driftwood enters Rosa's room and finds her crying over her missed love Riccardo. Tomasso makes an interesting escape from the detention cabin, accompanied by a witty music score. And finally, there is a great deal of lively singing and dancing on the ship, followed by what may be the most beautiful harp solo by Harpo Marx ever recorded on film (proving that great comedians can make you cry as well as laugh).Harpo remembered that when ""A Night at the Opera"" had its sneak preview at one particular theater, it bombed. When it was shown at the theater across the street immediately afterward, it became a sensation!"
104,A Night at the Opera,9,24 December 2016,"Good, but not especially  great, Marx Brothers","Typical Marx Brothers slapstick, one liners, and general mayhem. Although this film is generally ranked as the best of their MGM-produced pictures, I prefer ""A Day at the Races"". But, in general, I don't like to play the ranking game. They all have their unique pluses and minuses, as well as general pluses and minuses, which vary according to the individual viewer. If you like their style of comedy and music, this is worth a look and listen.As with most topnotch comedy teams, the brothers thrived on being very different from each other in looks and stage personality. Yet, they had enough liking for and understanding of each other to work together toward some goal. In being silent(except for his horn and whistle), Harpo mimics the traditional circus clown, and, to a lesser extent, a few of the clowns of silent films. Thus, the brothers incorporate the full potential of silent film comedy into an otherwise talkie comedy. I'm not familiar with any other comedy team of that era that utilized this formula. The basic plot is very simple. Chorister Ricardo(Allan Jones) of the New York Opera Company wants an opportunity to show he is even better than established lead Rodolfo(Walter Woolf King). But the director won't give him a chance. Thus, the brothers try to arrange a situation where Rodolfo can't perform, thus the director is forced to substitute Ricardo. The competition between these two singers extends to courting the lead female singer Rosa(Kitty Carlisle), who clearly favors Ricardo. Groucho, the business manager for wealthy widow Mrs. Claypool(Margaret Dumont), convinces her to invest $200,000. in the opera company, despite his insults to her. The troupe is returning to NYC from a European tour. Chico, Harpo, and Ricardo are stowaways who got on the boat from squeezing in Groucho's monstrous trunk. There follows the much remembered scene in Groucho's state room where many people squeeze together, along with the huge trunk, in a tiny room. Later, the stowaways somehow get through immigration with no passport nor travel pass. They decide to sabotage the opera performance and kidnap Rodolfo, hopefully forcing the director to substitute with Ricardo.My impression is that Rodolfo is as good as Ricardo, although the film audience doesn't agree. He is typecast as the bad guy, because he isn't the young struggling opponent. But, he doesn't seem like a bad guy....Margaret Dumont, Groucho's frequent foil in their films, could have had a bigger role in the film. Musicwise all 4 acts of Il Trovatore(the troubadour)are sung or played by the orchestra, to some extent. In addition, several new or recently composed songs are included. ""Alone"" is sung by Rosa, then by Ricardo, as Rosa is on the ship bound for NYC, and Ricardo is on shore. Harpo also plays it on the harp. Chico plays the familiar ""All I do is Dream of You"", later revisited in ""Singing in the Rain"". Ricardo, along with an informal chorus, sings Cosi-Cosa. I find Jones an excellent singer. The next year, he would take the lead role in ""Showboat"". Some people want to know if Chico could really play the piano that well, and whether Harpo could really play the harp, or were they dubbed. No, they were not dubbed, although their performances may have been sometimes prerecorded. As boys, the brothers used to get jobs playing the piano."
105,A Night at the Opera,8,13 September 2016,Zany.,"A gem. The Marx brothers go to the opera and help two singers -- Alan Jones and Kitty Carlisle -- become stars. The plot is otherwise too screwy to lay out.Margaret Dumont plays her accustomed role as the dowager burdened with lots and lots of money. There's a minuscule scene in an opera box that illustrates Groucho's deep devotion to Margaret Dumont. The two are seated and someone else enters the box and begins a conversation with Dumont. That exchange is the focus of the scene. Yet, in the background, almost blurry we see Groucho at once turn and begin whispering to the young girl in the next box. She looks appalled and her escort snatches her away. Groucho quickly pivots back to Dumont as if nothing had happened.The jokes are too many too recount. Probably the most popular is the stateroom scene but I get more of an arousal jag out of the brothers driving the police sergeant, Emit O'Connor, nuts by shuffling beds around from one room to another while he tries to understand what's happening and meanwhile the apoplectic cop is moaning and pulling out what's left of his hair.The final scene at the opera is full of pratfalls and dangerous acrobatics until it settles down into a straight duet from Il Travatore."
106,A Night at the Opera,7,22 September 2014,"Comedy classic, Leave all hope behind","Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) is the business manager for wealthy Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) investing $200k with Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman) of the New York Opera Company. Chorus man Ricardo Baroni (Alan Jones) is love with Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle) who is pursued by the arrogant Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King). Ricardo's illiterate friend Fiorello (Chico Marx) takes on the task of managing him. Tomasso (Harpo Marx) is Lassparri's abused silent whistling dresser. Gottlieb hires the great tenor Lassparri for $1000 a night. The opera company is traveling to NYC on a ship. Ricardo, Tomasso and Fiorello sneak on board as stowaways.I'm not a fan of the song and dance routines. It doesn't help that I really dislike opera. It stops the movie for me every time. Chico playing the piano for the kids is kinda cute and Harpo too. However there is nothing like Groucho's rapid fire jokes and Harpo's silent charm. I love their slapstick and they don't get better than the crowded room scene. This is a comedy classic."
107,A Night at the Opera,,16 December 2013,There Ain't No Sanity Claus,"While I personally prefer the Marx Bros' Paramount films, this one is probably the best of their MGM work. It features some of their most famous bits. The contract scene between Groucho and Chico (""Party of the first part..."") and the stateroom scene are comedy classics. There are tons of great lines throughout. Groucho's zingers are hilarious, as usual. It's not all good, though. The terrible singing numbers from Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle leave a lot to be desired. The Marx Bros' comedy works best when it's a free-for-all, with rapid-fire jokes and one gag after another. The more they included forced romantic subplots and musical numbers, the slower the pace was. Still, the comedy is superb. Watch and enjoy the laughs. Just be prepared to fast-forward through the Jones/Carlisle scenes."
108,A Night at the Opera,9,9 May 2008,One of the best if not the best,"I watched all of the Marx Brother's movies at least 100 times, this one will always be my favorite I think taut they are more funny in this than in some of their earlier ones.Acting is good, music is awesome, I saw The big store first, kinda funny how it was their last movie Even though I like all of the movies, this one would have to be my number one pick.My favorite Marx Brother would be Harpo, he is the funniest person next to grouchoHe is hilarious in this movieI Strongly recommend this one to any one who loves comedy movies"
109,A Night at the Opera,9,8 December 2007,Among The Very best of Comedy!,"Yes, the ""tumbling-out-of-the-stateroom"" scene is a true historical cinema classic, but my favorite scene is Harpo, on the deck, lip-syncing Maurice Chevalier's ""Louise"" with the phonograph strapped to his ass! The first time I saw this film, I almost gave up on the Three Stooges as masters of comedy, but then I realized the Stooges played as comic parody with their slapstick, while the Marx's comedy was pure genius! And Margaret Dumont as Grouch's ""straight"" foil is simply beautiful with her droll dowdiness! And who cannot laugh at Chico, with his phony Italian accent, and in particular, his piano playing to the crowd of kids! I'm sure those kids were laughing for real, unscripted. All in all, it's a true masterpiece we don't get to see often enough! I'll give it just a bit less than a perfect ten, because most of the ancillary characters are only there to fill in the gaps, and tend to slow it down a bit. But who's to say it wasn't designed and written that way?"
110,A Night at the Opera,10,14 October 2003,Another knee slapper from the Marx Brothers,"The Marx Brothers are still in great form in this movie. Zeppo had since left the acting business but Groucho, Chico, and Harpo are still funnier than hell. All of the hallmarks of Marx movies are present: Great musical pieces, Groucho's one-liners, Harpo's physical comedy, Chico's puns, the ultimate straight woman Margaret Dumont, and unfortunatly a boring in love couple that can sing. The plot is simple but is of course constructed to put the brothers Marx in the peak of high society where they can wreak their special brand of anarchy. Bottom Line: Just another movie in which the Marx brothers are at their best. I'm waiting for the DVD box set here. I don't know what's taking so long."
111,A Night at the Opera,10,20 November 2001,good word for the marx. bros,"This has to be one of the Marx's best movies. Good use of speed fastening produces hilarities such as Harpo running vertically up a stage backdrop,Harpo going down a circular flight of stairs and when everyone comes spilling out of a small boat cabin. The way they time their movie is excelent, such as when the swap the two rooms around. This is definatley a must see for Marx Bros. fans and even those not to have been fortunate enough to see one of these works of art."
112,A Night at the Opera,10,13 June 2001,the best Marx film I Have ever seen!!!,"A night at the Opera is one of the funniest comedies ever made. Groucho is funniest(as always) but Harpo and Chico are very funny to. I think that this is the funniest Marx brothers film ever made and one of the best comedies ever made to.I haven´t seen Duck Soup yet so I don´t know if that one is good,but I hope so!."
113,A Night at the Opera,10,21 February 2001,Can you laugh?,"If you are capable of laughter, than this film is a must-see.  The Marx Brothers' finest, and one the funniest films ever made.  This movie set standards for comedy that have been duplicated and/or ripped off in countless movies for 65 years and counting.  The stateroom scene has to be one of the 10 funniest scenes in cinema history, and the contract scene (""Party of the First Part"") shows that confusing legal rhetoric has been around for a long, long time (and a subject of jokes for just as long).  A film of ""true comedy"": anyone, any age, any culture, will find stuff to laugh at in this film."
114,A Night at the Opera,10,4 August 2000,Marx Brothers are the best,"I'm only 14 years old but I think the Marx Brothers are really the very best. ""A night at the opera"" has to be one of their best films. It's very funny and it has one of the best songs (even if it isn't Julius singing it) called Alone which me and my sister try to sing a long to. Full marks."
115,A Night at the Opera,6,2 October 2003,still entertaining for a twenty-year-old,"I'm in my twenties, so that gives you my cultural perspective on this film. I found ANATO pretty entertaining. Yeah, I fast-forwarded through the two signing numbers, and yeah a few jokes fell flat. But all in all this were some pretty absurd funny things going on. I can see how Bugs Bunny cartoons got some of their shenanigans. Much better rental that any current generic Hollywood muck. The hotel room and ship room scenes were funny because the people involved just accepted the abnormality, where any rational person wouldn't get caught up in it all. So, good dumb/ridiculous humor. Kind of a much tamer Adam Sandler."
116,A Night at the Opera,6,28 January 2008,Oh brothers...,"My first ever viewing of a Marx Brothers film and while it shows its age in many ways, this celebrated classic still made me laugh out loud and make me want to look out their other 30's classics in short order. It seems a shame that the boys had to accede to movie conventions of the day by the interpolation of two songs, one a light operatic ditty right out of Nelson Eddy & Jeanette MacDonald territory and the other an Astaire-type humorous rhythmic dance number, both replete with dance routines and almost zero participation of the brothers. The net effect of course is the dilution of the anarchic comedy which naturally is what we all really want to see. The comedy though is often terrific, the comedic timing of the brothers and the supporting cast (these guys needed good straight men - and women!) spot on. Who can forget the ""How many people can you get in a ship's state room?"" or the play-off between Chico and Groucho over a contract, plus there's lovely stuff with Chico and Harpo demonstrating their musical dexterity on the piano and harp respectively. Some of the dialogue is deliciously close to the bone too and a treat for modern ears proving that it's all in the delivery and in Groucho Marx of course we have one of the absolute masters at work."
117,A Night at the Opera,8,8 January 2005,"""There ain't no Sanity Clause.""","Producer Irving Thalberg had big plans for the Marx Brothers, who were already well-known for their relentless brand of comedy. He knew that by adding more of a concentration on story and conventional ""substance,"" the brothers could be so much more. Their earlier movies had not done well, due to the fact that they were similar to their stage shows, and not as polished as audiences expected their cinematic comedies to be. Many Marx Brothers fans will argue that it was the earlier films that were better, because they were so raw, and pure in their comedy. However, Thalberg's vision of what the Marx Brothers needed at the time. He provided Groucho, Chico, and Harpo (Zeppo was no longer with the group) with a larger budget, a director they respected (Sam Wood), and, most importantly, a fresh start. The result is what many consider to be the best of all of the Marx Brothers' films, A Night at the Opera. Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones play two relatively unknown opera singers trying to find success. The Marx Brothers help them, in their own way, of course, while making a mockery of the stuck-up opera company and its affiliates. There are countless quotable lines from this movie, an unyielding stream of puns and one-liners, and quite a few classic scenes, including the famous ""stateroom scene,"" which is an extraordinary example of physical comedy at its best. There are very few comedies that can compete with A Night at the Opera, just as there were very few comedians that could ever compare to Groucho, Chico, and Harpo...A spectacular comedy!"
118,A Night at the Opera,10,26 December 2004,My Farvorite next to the Three Stooges,"You gotta love those Marx Brothers, they are another wacky comedy team in the golden years of Hollywood next to Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges, Abbot and Costello, and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. And this one proves it all! Every scene is funny, and every line they say is hilarious and every action is unforgettable. Harpo is like an early American version of Mr. Bean and Benny Hill! I like the part when they discover their cabin in the boat, and how they went in disguise. Even though we are in the new millennium, and we would rather watch Jon Stewart or Jim Carey, or Adam Sandler, these guys still keep me laughing and they knock me dead! No profanity, no sexual content, but that's the way it should be! It makes even more hilarious. Recommended for those sick of the comedies you see today, or those who need a break from the adult and black comedies we see today."
119,A Night at the Opera,9,29 July 2004,A Night at the Opera (1935) ***1/2,"I was pretty much a Marx Brothers beginner when it came to my viewing of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, but I found it to be very funny, and the laughs were fairly consistent. Groucho's one-liners were top notch, and Harpo was in top form with his outrageous shenanigans. Chico, who is probably my least favorite of the trio, was no slouch either. This film is in the running as ""Best Marx Brothers Film"" for me.Add another half star if Opera doesn't make you want to commit suicide. I really didn't like the singing of Kitty Carlisle or Allan Jones in the least and I found it to greatly intrude on what otherwise may have been a perfect comedy (and what's Jones doing as part of the comedy entourage, by the way?). After reading Leonard Maltin's notes and listening to part of his DVD commentary, I see that he thinks the romance angle and music works well within the context of the film. I can't agree there, I'm afraid.Generally speaking, I think Irving Thalberg really had something there when he decided to weave more of a plot around the antics of the Marx Brothers for this one."
120,A Night at the Opera,,11 April 2003,Marxists unite!  Classic comedy of the siblings Marx.,A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (1935) ****  The Marx Brothers classic with the trio making trouble for a problematic opera company and their latest opus on mend with Margaret Dumont as one of the backers and hilarity ensuing with the acerbic Groucho and the slapstick shenanigans of Harpo and Chico.  Best bit and one for the film vault is The Stateroom Scene.  Brilliant lunacy.
121,A Night at the Opera,7,19 September 2014,Really funny but a bit meandering.,"The only other Marx brothers movie I've seen is Duck Soup and while A Night At The Opera is significantly better, I'm still not totally won over by them. Granted, I love Groucho, his sardonic one liners almost always hit the mark and he's the life and soul of their work. The other brothers I could take or leave, including the slapstick Harpo, who gets too many obvious sped up moments. It does take many liberties in its setups, as comedies of this stature often do, but a couple of times I didn't really feel in with the flow for the punchline. But when it's funny, it's really funny, especially in iconic scenes such as the stateroom one. The film could have done with less meandering in the mid-section, as I felt lost in the plot there. It's a shame that the actual opera singing is the most tedious bit, but fortunately they're few and far between. This style of filmmaking works in chunks, but the majority is entertaining at least.7/10"
122,A Night at the Opera,6,19 December 2008,Chaos...,"The usual Marx Brothers insanity, this one involving Groucho, Chico, and Harpo with love-struck opera singers, cruise-ship managers, and Margaret Dumont as an amusingly placid Mrs. Claypool. The film is better served by its comedic elements than by its musical moments, which pad the running time without accentuating the comic chaos. Fans of the Marx Brothers are quick to label the picture a classic--but of the three, only Groucho is exciting to watch. Many writing talents worked on the film, including an uncredited Buster Keaton, though curiously none of the Brothers Marx had any input. It will either leave you in the aisles or on the outside looking in. **1/2 from ****"
123,A Night at the Opera,6,26 December 2005,Side-Splitting Marx Brothers Classic Of Hapless High Society,"Otis B. Driftwood is a small-time theatrical agent scamming the wealthy Mrs Claypool in a deal to sponsor a New York opera company. Meanwhile, the disreputable Fiorello and Tomasso are trying to help their friend Riccardo gain recognition as a tenor. The swindlers' plans collide during a very unorthodox production of Verdi's Il Trovatore ...This was the Marx Brothers first big-budget movie with MGM, and many cite it as their best film. It is a beautiful production by the legendary Irving G. Thalberg, with a first-rate script by the talented Broadplay playwright George S. Kaufman and some incredibly funny sequences. Personally, it's not my favourite (that's Duck Soup, by a country mile), purely because I think the romantic subplot between Carlisle and Jones gets in the way too much and there's not enough of the irresistible Dumont. That aside however, there is lots of wonderful music and plenty of side-splitting scenes; the pack-everyone-in-Groucho's-cabin episode, the contract-shortening sequence (""You no fool me, there is-a no Sanity Claus !""), the chase-the-beds-around-the-hotel-room bit and the total cultural destruction of that bastion of upper-class social prowess, the metropolitan opera, with Groucho throwing peanuts to the crowd and Harpo sliding pirate-style down the backdrops. A wonderfully nutty black-and-white comedy classic."
124,A Night at the Opera,,24 September 2003,Dated fun with tedious sections,"Once again the highlights of this Marx brothers extravaganza are the one and two liners of undoubtedly the funniest of the three, Groucho. Predictably there's some clipping and the sound is occasionally grainy. Despite this 'A Night at the Opera' is generally fun to watch, the only unwelcome sections are the overly-long and superfluous musical numbers."
125,A Night at the Opera,7,1 March 2004,A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (DIDIER BECU),"For a movie that has been made in 1935, ""A night at the opera"" of course is a milestone in the history of movies but seeing it on some sunny Saturdayafternoon makes it quite different as how classic the faces might be, the comic ingredients have been aged (although for that time they were quite cruel). Never been that much of a Marx Brothers'-fan myself, I still think it is one of the movies you have to experience but seeing it so high ranked in the Top 250 makes me only think that people vote it because it is the kind of picture that simply has to appear in such list. Nice to see, even entertaining but more and more it will have its place in a museum rather than the entertainmentfactor itself."
126,A Night at the Opera,5,13 September 2005,unfortunately,"The Marx Brothers were always funny, but ""A Night at the Opera"" is weakened by the racism (the dancing black people, and the scene where Groucho, Chico and Harpo darken their faces to blend in). But if you get beyond that, it is a pretty funny movie. Otis Driftwood (Groucho) is playing all sorts of tricks on his superiors, while Fiorello (Chico) and Tommasso (Harpo) are up to their usual high jinx. I really liked the scene with all the books, and the whole sequence with the gorilla (not to mention the stateroom scene).Like I said, you may be disturbed by the portrayal of African-Americans, but otherwise, the movie is quite funny."
127,A Night at the Opera,9,16 November 2017,"Sorry, Zeppo...You Were Not Missed","""I told you to slow down, I nearly heard the opera."" I'm kind of obsessed with Groucho's one-liners. And Harpo and Chico's music. And the stateroom pile-up. And the air force disguises. And the contract bit. And the switching beds between the two hotel rooms. The Marx Bros weren't just anarchic, they were downright chaotic, in all the best ways."
128,A Night at the Opera,10,12 March 2017,the marx brothers at their very best!,"The interesting thing about ""A Night at the Opera"" is how much of a genuine, cliché plot it has. There is an obvious villain and protagonist, and both have goals that end in nothing but predictability. However, it gets interesting when the main attraction, that being the brilliant wit of the Marx Brothers, steps in. Every character other than these three wonderful, wild buffoons, is of a cliché and predictable nature, but they certainly aren't! While everyone else is playing it straight, they prove that they're still the same old Marx Brothers as they showcase some of their most hilarious and creative gags. I just find it truly unique and entertaining how this film feels as if its trying to be a predictable and heartwarming musical, but it keeps being interrupted by the absolutely unpredictable creativity of the Marx Brothers. The fact that everybody else is playing it so straight just adds to the great comedy here. Its all so creative and fantastic, and it is all the more creative and all the more fantastic when it is set up against the backdrop of what would normally be considered a melodramatic Hollywood musical!"
129,A Night at the Opera,9,26 November 2016,classic marx brothers!,"This was a good combination of jokes and sight gags. It starts off with a hilarious scene at a restaurant and never lets up. Groucho Marx plays a manager who has to back a pompous opera star and pay him $1,000 a night to sing. Any fan of the Marx Brothers will love this. My favorite scenes include the opening scene, the tearing up of the contract (""There ain't no sanity clause!""), the scene where there are too many people in the small room, the line ""I almost made the opera,"" and the ""showdown opera"" scene at the end. If you love the Marx Brothers or just need an introduction to their movies-this is the perfect one for you! By the way, the opera at the beginning is ""Pagliacci.""**** out of ****"
130,A Night at the Opera,9,29 July 2016,What'a ya mean there ain't no Sanity Claus?,"There must be one and he made this movie for me!...mine...mine...mine...I started to write a review of this crazy Marx Brothers' movie only to find that halfway through I ran out of words and had to go back. So then I found some more words in another dictionary and started out one more time. I was just about to land on the last period of the review and realized I forgot my keyboard (and plane...and gas) and had to go back again.They don't make movies like this anymore...in fact, they didn't make movies like this even back then. All I can say is, such lovely lunacy."
131,A Night at the Opera,10,17 February 2016,Absolutely fantastic,"Groucho strikes gold again in Hollywood's age of gold in 'Night at the opera"". The hilarious moments start right away at a restaurant where Mrs. Claypool (Margarate Durmonte) is meeting Otis P. Driftwood (Groucho) and he's already there with another woman (and with his back to Margarate) and he then joins Margarate (Groucho to Margarate: ""you had your back to me. When I meet a woman I expect her to look at my face, that's the price she hasta pay""). Groucho continues (""I was only with that woman cause she reminded me of you. Everything about you also reminds me of you, your hair, your eyes, everything about you reminds me of you, except you"".). The humor continues. The Marxs board a ship. So does Margarate and Rosa (Kitty Carlisle). Kitty sings ""Alone"" to Riccardo (Allen Jones) with her wonderful voice. She's also very beautiful. Ricardo sings talented too. I also like how even in the middle of ""Alone"", the Marx bros continue their hyjinks such as Groucho asking a ship crew as ship is about to depart: ""do I have time to leave the ship to pay a hotel bill?"" Crew member: ""no, its too late"". Groucho: ""thats fine with me"". Then ""Alone"" continues so beautifully that I really didn't care that the song was interrupted halfway with the Marx's hyjinks. Numerous more hilarious scenes coming. Groucho finds out the size of his room when pushing his giant suitcase in there and sees it's almost the size of the room (Groucho to porter: ""maybe tomorrow, can you take the case out of the room and I can go in it""). Out of the case comes stowaways Harpo, Chico, and Ricardo. Groucho orders food with them behind him in room (Harpo honks his horn then Groucho to caterer 3 times: ""and two hard boiled eggs"" Harpo honks shorter honk, ""and one duck egg"" Harpo honks repeatedly, ""either it's getting foggy out or 12 more hard boiled eggs""). Then more people, one after another, enter the room; two maids, an electrician, a manicurist, some girl, three caterers with food, and a cleaner. Groucho to cleaner: "" you can mop the ceiling, it's the only place where there's room"". Watch what happens then when Margarate opens the door. Hilarious. Then another great music act on the ship deck with Jones singing Casi casa with the Italain passengers dancing enjoying it, then another great Chico piano performance. Soon then Harpo, Chico, and Jones disguising themselves as longbearded aviators (they impersonated the same 3 guys that were on the ship where Groucho said ""is that 3 guys or one guy with 3 beards?""), and them presenting themselves City hall antics with Chico's very hilarious story about how they crossed the Atlantic and Harpo drinking glass after glass of water (and Groucho saying ""hurry it up, I see a guy in the crowd with a rope""). Continuous very funny scenes include Groucho, the detective, and the disappearing beds in the apartment, and the Marx's antics at the opera including the great ""take me out to the ballgame joke. And I know not everyone agrees but I also enjoyed the opera music, Kitty and Jones' ""Alone"" earlier on the ship, and the songs at the opera. Passion and.hilarious humur are a very really good mix"
132,A Night at the Opera,8,21 September 2015,"Brilliant, and hasn't aged a bit","75 years after it was released, A Night at the Opera is still as fresh and enjoyable as ever. A vehicle for the Marx Brothers' comic genius, it is excellent. Key to this is the Groucho wisecracks, coming at a rapid rate, and all hitting the spot.Harpo's clowning is also something to behold.Probably the most pleasantly surprising thing is Harpo and Chico's musical abilities - their piano and harp playing on the ship was amazing.I'm not a fan of opera, but the music in the movie was sublime.Great movie, and an all-time classic."
133,A Night at the Opera,10,7 February 2015,A pitch perfect comedy,"Sam Wood's A Night at the Opera is one of the best comedic movies that I have seen in recent years. This the first movie that I saw that the Marx brothers starred in and for me it was worth my time, the movie tells the story of a business manager named Otis B. Driftwood (played by Groucho Marx) who is trying to get money from Mrs. Claypool (played by Margaret Dumont) in order to get her in high society and as well as trying to get her money, and comes up with an idea that opera is the best way of business and teams up with Fiorello (played by Chico Marx), and Tomasso (played by Harpo Marx) and as well as two rising opera stars Rosa Castaldi (played by Kitty Carlisle) and Ricardo Baroni (played by Allan Jones) and both don't like a selfish opera singer named Rodolfo Lassparri (played by Walter Woolf King). Sam Wood (1883-1949) was the perfect choice to direct this film and had he declined the offer the film wouldn't have been as perfect a film as it still is considered today. This movie is one of 1935s best films as well as one of the best comedy movies ever made."
134,A Night at the Opera,10,14 December 2007,A Night at the Opera,"I knew the glasses with big black brows, big nose and big black moustache mask (possibly with cigar included) you get in joke shops, and I had always wanted to see a film with the guy who had them, along with his brothers. The Marx Brothers were truly geniuses of witty dialogue and zany slapstick antics, all to get the best laughs, and this film certainly deserves its title as one of the great classic comedies. Basically this film takes on high society, where Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx, who painted that moustache with dark greasepaint) is a cheeky businessman with hopes that wealthy Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) will invest in his opera company. Meanwhile, Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones) and his love Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle) are struggling tenors hoping to climb in stardom, but cannot get anywhere with no-one listening, and Ricardo's backstage friend Fiorello (Chico Marx) volunteers to be his agent, and they, along with mute Tomasso (Harpo Marx) manage to sneak onto a ship heading towards the city of an opera theatre performance. Hiding in his room, they meet Otis who promises to tell no-one of their hiding, and hopefully get them to stardom and acceptance, including for himself. The rest of the film basically sees them getting some fans, near misses with police trying to catch them, and eventually Ricardo and Rosa getting the performances and praise they hoped for. Also starring Siegfried Rumann as Herman Gottlieb, Walter Woolf King as Rodolfo Lassparri and Edward Keane as Captain. Groucho gets all the best lines, Chico gets some good slapstick and lines, and Harpo is just the lovable mute. The highlights of the film for me are Groucho ordering many varieties of food from the menu (including repetitive hard boiled egg ordering from Chico, and honking from Harpo), the brothers and many ship workers gathering in the small room, and the brothers escaping the room taking beds with them. It may be old, and it may drag on the tiniest bit with the necessary operatic and musical moments, but it still manages to create laughs. The Marx Brothers were number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, the film was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 23 on Film 4's 50 Films You Must See Before You Die. Outstanding!"
135,A Night at the Opera,8,25 December 2003,Essential Marx,"This one has the usual Marx stuff at their peak.  Witty repartee, needling stuffed shirts, hilarious sight gags, musical interludes with Chico strumming the ivories and Harpo plucking the, well, harp like an angel.""A Night at the Opera"" was almost the last of about a handful of decent films the Marx Brothers did together.  I didn't realize before that they did so few.  But then I have to realize they were all in the mid-40's already.Pretty good special effects for a 1935 film too.  Harpo's romp back stage, on stage and above stage are impressive."
136,A Night at the Opera,10,4 September 1999,"Its the Marx Brothers, Enough said","Brilliant,there's not much more you can say about the Marx Brothers. A funnier bunch of people you will never see on the big screen. I'm like Harpo- a little stuck for something to say."
137,A Night at the Opera,,25 July 1999,Arguably the funniest of the Marx Bros films,"A combination of the talents of the Marx Bros, well tried comedy writers, and the sure hand of MGM enfant terrible, Irvine Thalberg, make this classic arguably the funniest and best of the Marx Bros films.Classic scenes include:the 'sanity clause' routine, when Groucho and Chico haggle over the terms of the contract for their new found star tenorthe stateroom scene - everybody has seen this hilarious scenethe stowage class party on the boat on which the brothers have stowed away, with one of Harpo's vintage harp playing scenesthe scene in the New York apartment where the police inspector is trying to track down the brothers.  This scene has an almost surreal quality and never fails to kill me!Legend has it that the brothers arranged for their proud father to appear as an extra in the film.  He appears as one of the crowd on the dockside as the boat leaves for New York.  However, his enthusiasm got the better of him and he also appears on the boat waving back to himself. Can't say I have ever picked him out!!If you have never seen this film (how?) - rent it this week-end, open a bottle of wine - and have a good laugh!"
138,A Night at the Opera,10,27 May 1999,Their funniest film!,"In the late 1920's, the Marx Brothers were the toast of the Broadway Stage. They were soon signed to a contract with Paramount, and although their pictures created a loyal following, the masses were unamused by their antics.  Paramount canceled their contract after five films.  Irving Thalberg, the boy genius of MGM Studios, signed them immediately.  Their first outing for their new studio was A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, which is considered by many to be their funniest film.  Even the opening credits start you laughing.  The famous MGM lion is replaced by a roaring Graucho, Chico and the honking of a horn by Harpo!"
139,A Night at the Opera,10,13 April 1999,The Last Really Good Marx Bros. Movie,"It's also probably the best - the peak of their careers.  Day at the Races is essentially a re-established remake of Night.  it's funny, but Night, as the original is even funnier.  This one has everything:  verbal gymnastics, slapstick comedy, Zeppo being dropped for the slightly more talented straight man the brothers attach their fortune to, everything.  It has a few musical numbers to slow down the pace, but at least they fit in reasonably well.  the stateroom gag is good, but the verbal ""Party of the first part"" routine and the final trashing of the operahouse are the superior of anything produced in dozens of Police Squad and Hot Shots movies.  AMC runs it pretty regularly these days, so catch it if you can."
140,A Night at the Opera,10,31 December 1998,Verdi would giggle too if he was in the audience,"The combination of Groucho's twitching eyebrows, loping stride and well aimed dry comments are enough to bring giggles from the most serious but the crazy scenery changes and deliberate sabotage of the tenor on the opening night of the opera are the perfect setting for the antics of Harpo and Chico - a must for all opera fans !"
141,A Night at the Opera,,29 September 2001,The Marx Brothers Masterpiece,"""A Night At The Opera"" has to be the funniest movie of all time. There is non stop laughs from beginning to end. The kind of comedy used in this movie is unlike the comedy we have today. If you are looking for a movie that will make you feel good and will make you laugh and smile, see this movie. It is a perfect film to use for yourself when you are just looking to have a good time. I saw this movie one rainy night on AMC (American movie classics) or TMC (Turner movie classics) and was amazed at how well done it was.  The marx brothers do everything right in this great film. I could not stop laughing the first time i saw this film. Now, everytime i watch this film, i crack up even more at  the same parts i laughed at before, but harder. This is truly a MUST SEE . I give this movie a ***** out of *****."
142,A Night at the Opera,9,19 September 2001,"Marx, Marx, Marx","As newborns know, this film Marx (bad joke) the Marx's debut at MGM. They couldn't have picked a better one: They already made Duck Soup, and this was their next best.As the tagline says, ""Don't miss it! The funniest picture ever made!"" They got the first part right, but the part about it being ""the funniest"" is off.Don't get me wrong, though: This is funny."
143,A Night at the Opera,8,22 July 2001,Minnie's boys -- they're at it again!,"Minnie Marx, when she was alive, must have often wondered where she went wrong. She raised such nice boys. Such fine boys. What craziness is it to make them do the things they do. I don't know but we're all much happier and eternally grateful for said ""craziness.""In ""A Night at the Opera,"" their first movie for MGM after five earlier ones for Paramount, the boys are in their usual top form. The plot? Well, O.K. If you insist. Two talented but unknown singers are in Europe and wanting to make their way to New York and ""The Big Time."" And who else to help them get there to realize their dream(s) but.....The Marx Brothers? That's it. The plot.Although the screenwriter was the renowned and legendary George S. Kaufman, everyone knows that a script to The Marx Brothers is just an idea, a jumping off point. Especially for Groucho. The boys NEVER let the script get in the way when there's a good joke to be had at somebody's expense. Including themselves!Beyond the Marxes, two additional treats in this Social Security-aged movie are seeing and listening to the wonderful singing of both Allan Jones (Jack's dad) and Kitty Carlisle, she of the 1960s TV game show ""To Tell the Truth"" (among others). Remember? I did, however, miss Margaret Dumont in this movie. She was Groucho's much put-upon foil in their five Paramount movies. Groucho without Margaret available to be insulted to a fare-thee-well? Unthinkable! But there you are.Harpo, just as in their earlier movies, continues to give insanity a bad name (while still playing such beautiful music on the harp), while Chico plays that piano in his purely inimitable fashion, all the while saying perfectly normal things which make no sense at all in his hopeless Italian dialect. What a gang! No wonder Minnie wondered where she went wrong. What mother wouldn't with sons like these?This movie, by the way, contains a very important Public Service Announcement (PSA) which is still just as valid in 2001 as it was in 1935. Wishing to be helpful, I am passing it along. Here it is: If ever you have a contract to sign, make sure you first check it to be sure it has.....""A Sanity Clause."" You're welcome."
144,A Night at the Opera,9,22 June 2001,Possibly the Best of all the Marx Brothers' Movies,"I consider ""A Night At The Opera"" the Marx Brothers' overall best movie for the reason that this is the most polished (production-wise) of all their movies.  Another, and perhaps more important reason is that they are in a place were they could do the most damage, the opera.  What better place for Marx brothers chaos and anarchy than a place in which the majority of the people are the conservative ""upper class"". Groucho, Chico and Harpo are put into situations in which they are in the middle of a rich woman trying to get into society, two singers in love, the meddlesome star of the opera, and the New York Opera Company.  Like the earlier Marx film ""Duck Soup"", the musical parts of this movie are relevant and does not seem forced into the movie.  The scenes have got to be seen to be believed so I don't even want to mention any.  A great comedy that is perhaps the ""greatest""."
145,A Night at the Opera,10,18 October 1998,one of my 10 favourites,"Timing, camera, sound in the grand Chase scene on stage are just as perfect as anyone makes them today with all the special effects possible."
146,A Night at the Opera,10,14 June 2002,As Good as It Got,"The Marx Brothers, especially Groucho, were comedic geniuses. And their best film was easily A Night at the Opera. So many classic scenes connect the unimportant storyline. Perhaps the funniest movie of alltime, with maybe only Monty Python and the Holy Grail rivaling its comedic pace. It's a crime that this film isn't in the top 100 list on this website."
