0,Ice Age: Collision Course,10,25 July 2016,Entertaining For Kids & Adults .,"While trying to bury his acorn, Scrat accidentally activates an abandoned alien ship that takes him into deep space, where he unwittingly sends several asteroids en route to a collision with Earth.Meanwhile, Manny is worried about the upcoming marriage between Peaches and her fiancé, Julian, while Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family but their fierce appearance tend to scare kids, and Sid is dumped by his girlfriend, Francine, just as he is about to propose to her. During Manny and Ellie's wedding anniversary party, some of the asteroids strike the place and the herd barely escape with their lives. Meanwhile, at the underground cavern, Buck returns a dinosaur egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen from a trio of Dromaeosaurs led by their father Gavin, only to discover an ancient stone pillar, which he takes to the surface, where he meets Manny and the others.Buck explains to the herd that according to the pillar, the asteroids had caused several extinctions in the past and with a massive one still incoming, he claims that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones, as according to its engravings, they always fall at the same place. However, the three Dromaeosaurs, having listened their conversation, decide to stop them, believing that they could be safe from the impact, as they can fly, thus not only getting their revenge on Buck, but also killing all mammals and securing domination over Earth for their species.As the herd travels to the crash site, they discover that the asteroids have electro-magnetic properties, thus if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit, they could attract the main asteroid as well and prevent it from falling on Earth. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the Dromaeosaurs, the herd arrives at ""Geotopia"", a community of animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago, where Sid meets Brooke, a female ground sloth who falls in love with him. However, Shangri Llama, the leader of Geotopia, refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to send the city's crystals into space in order to prevent the imminent impact, as they are the key to the residents' longevity, until Sid unwillingly destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the stones to present Brooke with, making all the Geotopians grow old up to their real ages, including Brooke herself.Once Brooke convinces the Geotopians that preventing the asteroid's fall is more important than their lost youth, they and the herd help with Buck's plan, which is to fill up a geyser with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away, but the Dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene, until one of them, realizing that they will not survive as well if the asteroid falls, convinces the others to also help. The plan works, and the asteroid is pulled back into space. The herd then departs back home, including Sid, who parts ways from Brooke, but just after they leave, an asteroid piece falls inside a hot spring, giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Sid's granny, who stayed behind with them regain their youth. After the herd returns, Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding, Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before, and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid.In the film's epilogue, Scrat keeps struggling to control the alien ship until it crashes on Mars, destroying all life on the planet."
1,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,9 December 2016,The Kid liked it. I didn't.,"From the first minute, it's clear that the writers are really desperate to bring out fresh ideas, but it just comes across as purely that; desperation. It borders on the ludicrous. My kid watched on silently, but I never heard her laugh once. Not good for a comedy. It's dull. It's ridiculous. It's way over the top, even for a animated kids film with talking mammoths. It's just plain stupid. This series has reached its end. I really hope it's over but I hear there's another in the works. While there's still a modicum of profit, the machine keeps churning. It's really sad, and an insult to the first few films, which were fun and fresh. Let it die. It's begging to be put down."
2,Ice Age: Collision Course,10,6 October 2016,Awesome as usual,"People need to chill about this movie! Like, seriously, based on all the negative comments I've seen, I've come to the conclusion that people have a tremendous lack of sense of humor! This movie is not to be taken seriously, to be analyzed, or to be hated upon - it is to be ENJOYED! I laughed my a** off :D The characters are absolutely adorable, as usual,the voicing is brilliant! I loved everything about it (obviously) and I don't know why I felt the need to come here and read the comments...I always seem to make that mistake. All in all, I had a great time, planning to watch it at least another 3 times :D *need to have 10 lines of text*"
3,Ice Age: Collision Course,10,23 July 2016,We will be happily watching this again and again and again...,"My youngest would watch a movie so many times you would start to quote it in your sleep. But when the film is as great at the Ice Age movies, you don't mind. I was concerned that this one could not be as hilarious as the others and I am so glad I was worried for nothing. Until now ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" was our family's go to Ice Age movie, but this one is even better... and I didn't think that was possible. In addition to having lots of silly laughs for the kids, there is a ton of great humor - great clean humor - just for adult belly laughs. And an actual plot, which some kids movies tend to forget. It has such a strong, positive, family message. Every member of our family agrees that this is one to own, each of us for different reasons. So here is a huge thumbs up from our gang, ages 7 to 42."
4,Ice Age: Collision Course,9,4 October 2016,"You kept me happy, you kept me laughing!","Oh that was a surprise. I'm a fan of ice age movie series. Honestly i didn't like the previous ice age at all. The old granny is so cool. And the other kids. This movie! Oh man this is so good to be happy and laugh like a baby. Story wasn't so bigger or complex but it's OK. To bad that stupid adults giving awful reviews. It's a kid movie. So don't listen to old people. I really liked this.Oh come on people, why giving 1 star? You grumpy old donkeys stop this nonsense. Don't try to give your rude opinion on internet.And the soundtrack that Jessie J made. This was awesome. I'm thinking to watch this again and i will ."
5,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,30 September 2016,stop milking the cow,"OK, ice age 1 was hilarious and a new standard for animation humor; together with Shrek, that came a year earlier. But where Shrek kept pretty consistent through the sequels (the attack of the princesses in part 3 was a absolute high in animation comedy), Ice Age dropped away further each sequel. Shrek stopped in time, Ice age should have stopped after 3. Continental drift was already hardly worth watching.This latest sequel is maybe one of the worst animation movies ever. The story-line is horrible and it is simply not funny. The writers are clearly struggling to make up a story the use all clichés they can find. Even Scrat is not funny most of the time, although he lifts the rest of the movie up.Will kids like this movie? Probably, but it lacks the wonder and quality of the first Ice Age. An Ice Age fan better avoids this movie"
6,Ice Age: Collision Course,10,22 July 2016,"Hilarious, visually beautiful, awesome 3D effects","The fifth Ice Age installment to come out in theatres, Blue Sky Studios has once again made me love this franchise. After the cute yet sometimes cringe-worthy Secret Life Of Pets and the good yet slightly overrated Finding Dory, I was expecting another typical average everyday kids movie, but what I got was a really funny family flick full of laughs for all ages. The whole theater was in stitches from how much they were laughing and giggling! The animation is amazing, from the photorealistic textures of the animals to the colorful backgrounds full of purplish vibe, and it makes great use of 3D effects, with countless gimmicks being thrown towards the audience and a fantastic sense of space in almost every shot of the movie. The voice actors are all energetic and they fit their characters perfectly, with Simon Pegg and Chris Wedge's priceless comedic performances. Overall, Ice Age: Collision Course is the only animated film worth seeing this year other than Zootopia, with everything you could possibly want from an animated family comedy. And by the way- Scrat is again the most hilarious portion of an already hilarious film!"
7,Ice Age: Collision Course,10,22 July 2016,Fun Age,"Before I begin this review, let me state that I have IBS. For those of you who do not know, IBS stands for Irritable bowel syndrome. This diagnosis causes me to have very impulsive, and often inexcusable bathroom troubles.On to the review. I have to just say, wow. Ice Age: Collision Course, being the 5th installment of this animated franchise, is still as good as it gets while Blue Sky has a say in it. Sure, some people may say that the last thing a franchise does is launch its characters into space before its torn apart, but Blue Sky has once again found a way to picture its beloved Cg characters in a fresh, and beautiful light.The animation was as beautiful as ever, the fur seems to be better facilitated- simulated and cached with each film, and of course, being in space, Blue Sky had the opportunity to take its effect simulations to outside of the planet, itself.The work that Blue Sky put into this film, in my opinion, may have even been too beautiful. I got a bit too excited and had to run to the bathroom about 2/3 into the animation, causing me to miss a pivotal moment. If there was one problem with my experience watching the new Ice Age, its that I had to watch it with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.-Henry"
8,Ice Age: Collision Course,10,27 July 2016,Great movie but no more sequels please.,"Just watched the movie today.The movie is quite emotional at the ending and the jokes are pretty funny that makes me laughed out loud. However, I was shocked by the box office and the critical response of the movie.The movie had already in cinemas for a week but only grossed for 200 million dollars, and the critical response is quite negative, the movie have only scored 'B+' from the 'A+' to 'F' scale, according to Wikipedia. It is proof that the audiences have already get bored from the series as they thought that the movie makers of this series are only wanted to make more money so that they just keep on making more sequels of the movie.Until then, they have been made of total four sequels in fourteen years. I personally not a very big fan of the animation movies, but Ice Age is one of my favorite movie of all time and me childhood for unknown reason. But starting from Ice Age : Continental Drift, I felt that the series is starting to off course that it just like to make a massive money grab, which I am not very appreciate. But however, Ice Age : Collision Course gave the series a come back-to-life chance, the movie is hilarious and have some touching scenes that with a lot of ups and downs in it.This movie would sure make you have a great day at the cinema. But also, I hope that there won't be more sequels after Ice Age : Collision Course in the future. Otherwise, the critical response would be even more worse."
9,Ice Age: Collision Course,10,15 July 2016,Great animation,"I wasn't too impressed by the trailer, but I'm a sucker for 3D animation, so I went anyway. I'm glad I did because this is a fun, funny movie which had the audience laughing out loud in places. The plot is exciting as our gang makes its way towards the place where the asteroid is to strike, in a bid to ward it off. Simon Pegg playing the weasel, who leads the pack, is really good. His British accent somehow suited the character! The sloth has a major role this time and is totally engaging. The animation is excellent, making full use of the 3D effects, which is nice, since that's the reason I went to the cinema to see it in the first place."
10,Ice Age: Collision Course,,14 July 2016,Amazing Conclusion To The Trilogy,"First off, after Ice Age:Continental Drift 4 years ago, i thought they would end it there because that by far was the best one. When i discovered they were making a new one, i was unsure about it. How times have changed.Its great to see Manny and Ellie trying to stop Peaches and her new boyfriend from leaving them, whilst Sid tries to find true love after 15 years of trying. Diego and Shira are trying to settle in after thinking how scary they are. And Scrat is just Scrat, doing all sort nonsense like destroying life on Mars, nearly ending the world and a lot more. But I was extremely pleased to hear that Buck, who has not been seen since Dawn of the Dinosaurs, was back and better than ever. Sadly Louis, played by Josh Gad, didn't return. R.I.P.Still thanks to the new recruits such as Adam Devine as Julian and Jessie J as Sids long-lost love Brooke, I got to see a massive treat. Lots of humour and too good to be real, thank you for ending in style Ice Age producers."
11,Ice Age: Collision Course,10,21 July 2016,Ice age franchise was one of the best animated film there is.,"Ice age franchise was one of the best animated film there is. I don't See why some butt-hurts and nit-picks have a problem with it hahaha, ugh i bet These guys have brain issues or something, i mean my son,at 3 can Understand the sense of humor of this movie. Our family loves ice age From the beginning, we watched it all kudos to blue sky. Please make More franchise series of ice age. It is such a great entertainment for The whole family. My baby always loves the part where Scrat messes up, Lol, and my dad,45 finds it funny too. For thirteen years blue sky is Making ice age more and more exciting and we just can't get enough of It, we want more haha"
12,Ice Age: Collision Course,8,23 July 2016,"""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is surprisingly entertaining  especially for the fifth installment in the franchise.","With the release of Blue Sky Studios' ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" (PG, 1:34), the ""Ice Age"" series of movies has become the 13th highest grossing film franchise to date and, as IMDb.com tells it, ""the first computer animated theatrical franchise to feature five installments."" A closer look reveals some even more interesting facts about the franchise. Each of the previous four films got equal or lower ratings as compared to the previous film (according to Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and CinemaScore), but each earned MORE money than its predecessor (except for the fourth one, in regards to North America). The films get ideas from each other (with the third and fifth inspired by the museum scene in the first) and also spawn spin-off short films (two of which became Oscar nominees) and television specials.Beyond all that, over the 14 years between the first film (2002's ""Ice Age"") and this fifth installment in 2016, directors have come and gone (with some overlap), with the core voice cast remaining remarkably consistent, while each film also added new characters. The original movie's four main voice actors (Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary and Chris Wedge) have appeared in all five films, three others (Queen Latifah, Seann William Scott and Josh Peck) have appeared in all but the first film and over 30 voice actors (with many big names in the mix) worked on either one or two of these movies. Putting it another way, ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" features seven actors who have voiced characters in four or all five of the ""Ice Age"" movies and four others are back for seconds  and what a talented cast they form! ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" takes place four years after the action in the previous film  the same amount of time between the release of the films  just like the actual time and story time gaps between all the ""Ice Age"" films. As the fifth edition opens, the cute, accident-prone, acorn-loving saber tooth squirrel, Scrat (Wedge), finds a flying saucer encased in ice, but accidentally (in pursuit of that acorn, of course), breaks the ship free and flies it into outer space  with disastrous results for our solar system (as you may have seen in the animated short ""Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe"" which preceded 2015's theatrical showings of ""The Peanuts Movie""). Scrat's misadventures in space inadvertently send a large asteroid hurtling towards earth, unbeknownst to the relatively carefree prehistoric mammals living below.The Herd (as the main characters in the franchise are called) are, for the moment, all oblivious to their impending doom and doing their best to live their lives as happily as possible. Peaches (Keke Palmer), the daughter of wooly mammoths Manny and Ellie (Romano and Latifah), is making plans for her marriage to fellow mammoth Julian (Adam DeVine). Manny is having a hard time warming up to the eager-to-please Julian (who calls his future father-in-law ""Dad Bro"") and both Manny and Ellie are struggling with the idea of ""losing"" their only child. It also happens to be Manny and Ellie's anniversary and Manny (who has forgotten) allows Ellie to believe that a well-timed meteor shower is his gift to her.That celestial event, however, turns out to be the opening salvo in what could mean the extinction of all life on earth. The resourceful and smarter-than-he-looks one-eyed weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg) discovers and interprets an ancient prophecy carved in stone which reveals that a huge asteroid is coming  and what previous asteroids have done to the earth. With the help of an even smarter weasel named Neil deBuck Weasel (Neil deGrasse Tyson), Buck hatches a plan that might actually save the world, but he's going to need the help of the rest of The Herd. Besides Manny and his family, others that get involved include saber tooth tiger couple Diego (Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez), lisping lovelorn ground sloth Sid (Leguizamo) and even the irreverent comical opossums Crash & Eddie (Scott and Peck).As they work to carry out their mission, The Herd makes new friends  and new enemies. Living at the location where Buck says the big asteroid is going to strike is a hippy community that includes a pretty sloth named Brooke (Jesse J), a fearless rabbit called Teddy (Michael Strahan) and a pair of ""minicorns"" named Bubbles and Misty (Lilly Singh), all of whom are led by a self-centered guru called Shangri Llama (Jesse Tyler Ferguson). Meanwhile, three flying dinosaurs (Nick Offerman, Stephanie Beatriz and Max Greenfield) don't think it's such a bad thing for all the mammals to perish (thinking that the dinosaurs will be able to simply soar above the destruction) and Scrat is still in space chasing that acorn.""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is surprisingly entertaining  especially for the fifth installment in the franchise. The animation takes full advantage of the latest CGI technology and it looks great (although I'm not sure that it's worth it to pay extra for the 3D glasses). The returning characters feel as fresh as ever and the new characters blend in beautifully with The Herd  not to mention that the voice cast may be one of the best assembled for a single animated feature. What's more, this movie actually has a plot! The film's story, themes, script and jokes are likely to entertain kids and adults alike. ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is very amusing  and fun for the whole family! ""A-"""
13,Ice Age: Collision Course,8,20 July 2016,great adventure with comedy,great animation movie full of comedy and adventure Animation movies revolution is started i don't know when but now it is also used in real movies to create some special scene who is not possible to done in real life like there is enough scene of captain America: civil war created in animation that's cool but i don't know why they are increasing budget to just hire some famous celebrity to give his Voice even they don't have good voice all famous celebrity don't have good voice except #Amrish Puri he really have a good voice that's worth to use as #Ravan voice in Ramayana Movie but now if movie maker want they can hire some comedian who can produce anyones voice mostly i saw another matter is people just go to watch movie to just because his fav. celebrity gives voice on it like in #Jumbo movie #Akshay gives his voice and people got crazy well another matter when they provide a big popular actors voice they don't need to do advt. anymore that's the main benefit. well in this movie how some animals try to saving earth to a astronaut and really great adventure and i watched Hindi dubbed version it's dialogue are too funny.
14,Ice Age: Collision Course,8,3 July 2016,Really Funny Film,"This movie really improved on the previous one. It set a great bar for the humour for the foremost, as me and the audience I was with were rolling around in laughter. And that's what really made the movie for me. It was just hilarious. The characters were still as memorable and funny as ever, the new additions were a delight and the crazy plot made it all the more perfect popcorn flick. I especially think young children ages 5 to 10 will love it, and you'd have to be a complete grump not to get even one laugh from the film when they're throwing jokes out left, right and center. Truly just a fun film. Left me feeling happy and exhilarated after the watch. I won't give any spoilers, just know this film had a much more complex plot than all the previous with many different story lines going on at once. I also think each character got the chance to shine in this one, which had been lacking in the previous two installments. But comedy wise, I actually think this could be smarter and funnier in it's humour to Secret Life Of Pets, which was really funny too- but more sight gags. Take your kids to see it if you want a fun film to pass the time, and remember to make a collision at the cinema!"
15,Ice Age: Collision Course,7,17 July 2016,An entertaining but unnecessary sequel.,"Ice Age: Collision Course continues with the adventures of Manny(Ray Romano), Diego(Denis Leary) & Sid(John Leguizamo). When Earth is about to be bombarded by a meteor shower, it is up to Manny, Diego, Sid & the rest of the herd, to save themselves & prevent the end of the world. They take the help of their old friend, Buck(Simon Pegg). Ice Age: Collision Course is a fun film. Kids will love it. However, adults will only find it mildly entertaining. Personally, I feel that the Ice Age franchise should have ended with the fourth movie. Ice Age(2002), Ice Age: The Meltdown(2006), Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs(2009) & Ice Age: Continental Drift(2012) are all great movies. Ice Age: Continental Drift(2012) has a perfect ending & there was absolutely no need to make further sequels. Blue Sky Studios decided to make one more Ice Age movie. This film is not boring at all. However, I am a fan of the Ice Age movies and, I am slightly disappointed with this film. There is not as much humor in this movie, as there is in previous installments. There are funny scenes but, there are not as many of them, as I would have liked. There are a slew of new characters. Some of them are welcome additions but, some of them are not. Due to the fact that there are too many characters, some of our favorite characters get sidelined. These are the movie's flaws. The animation is great. The 3D is impressive. The voice acting is amazing. Ray Romano is awesome as Manny. John Leguizamo is outstanding as Sid. Denis Leary is brilliant as Diego. Simon Pegg is spectacular as Buck. Queen Latifah is good as Ellie. Keke Palmer is superb as Peaches. Adam Devine is endearing as Julian. Wanda Sykes is hilarious as Granny. Seann William Scott & Josh Peck are funny as Crash & Eddie, respectively. Nick Offerman, Max Greenfield & Stephanie Beatriz are adequate as Gavin, Roger & Gertie, respectively. Jennifer Lopez is effective as Shira. Jesse Tyler Ferguson & Jessie J are impressive as Shangri Llama & Brooke, respectively. Chris Wedge is hysterical as Scrat. Ice Age: Collision Course is worth a watch. However, watch it with low expectations."
16,Ice Age: Collision Course,6,3 July 2016,Above Average family fun,"Roughly thirteen years on since the first Ice Age was released and the gang are still going strong. Manny, Sid and Diego, this one being the fifth in the feature length series and the longest, by only a few minutes. Supposedly the final in the franchise we see an expected happy ending instead of total extinction. It's the full film extension of Blue Sky Studio's short, Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe which was released last year, obviously starring Ice Age favourite Scrat, who intergalactically haphazardly arranges the planets in imaginative fashion whilst inadvertently thrusting an asteroid towards the Earth threatening all of it's existence, of course, all because of that elusive nut. Simon Pegg's Buck returns for more of a main role, leading the team to save the planet and is highly entertaining, more so than the rest of the pack. The story sidetracks a little more with Manny than Sid and Diego and there's quite a lot that goes on with an assortment of fresh characters including dino-birds and a spiritual spitting llama. There's an underlining message about excepting change and moving on, letting go and growing up which makes way for the subplot of Julian and Francine's relationship. It's seems family and marriage plays an important part of the story but not to the level to become boring of bogged down by it. John Debney composes the score this time round taking over from John Powell who has done quite a lot of animated features, like Rio, Happy Feet, Shrek and How To Train Your Dragon. Nothing really stood out from the score but the soundtrack, using Trevor Rabin's Armageddon theme tune was cheeky and Buck sings a clever twist of what I'm sure is Mozart's Marriage of Figaro. The animation is far superior than when you look back at the first Ice Age in 2002. It's come a long way since then and while I was watching Scrat move planets I was thinking this might be worth the extra to see in 3D. Incredible detail and the action flows superbly, especially Buck's scenes. It's fast paced I believe in hope to not lose the attention of the kids, it has a surefire script where characters literally bounce off one another creating enough comedy for everyone though it lacks the out loud laughter and some Sid silliness falls flat. It's above average, light entertainment for the whole family that is, for some part, visual stunning and fans of the series should enjoy it, but I doubt it'll be a film to end up on my shelf. Running Time: 6 The Cast: 7 Performance: 7 Direction: 7 Story: 5 Script: 6 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 6 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: 058% 6/10"
17,Ice Age: Collision Course,8,23 July 2016,it was a very good movie :),"Ice Age Collision course was very good, the story about a asteroid who will destroy the earth and Buck the Weasel from Ice Age 3 who help the Herd who meet the Geotopia's creatures who need them to stop the asteroid. (8/10)The news characters are so cool and relax like Julian, Brooke and Shangri-Llama. The dinos birds family, adorable and nice like roger , funny and a little creepy like Gertie and Gavin. The returning character buck was very good but he must to makes a lots hilarious things in this film. (8/10)The music soundtracks composed by John Debney the jungle book's composer his work is super not prodigious but super. (7/10).The humor, was good but not enough hilarious like in Ice Age 3 by examples (7/10).anyway it was a very good film animation not super but a very good. ^^ thank you for your work."
18,Ice Age: Collision Course,2,17 September 2016,"This series really went down hill, and I'm sad to say it","I've seen all the ""Ice Age"" films in the cinema.. Except for this one. And I'm glad I didn't. It fascinating to see how weirdly this series evolved over time.I remember going to see ""Ice Age"" in cinemas in 2002 and having a great experience. The first movie really hit the mark for me when I was young. I thought it was good how grounded it was, yes it had jokes, but it was all grounded in the era the film took place in. A kid could enjoy all of the humor, but at the same time learn a little bit of prehistoric animals. It had its serious moments too. Like for example, it showed the humans hunting mammoths and the saber-tooth tigers hunting as well.Now this series has gone overboard and exaggerated everything. It opens with Scrat the squirrel basically destroying the solar system with a space ship. I mean, what happened? How did we end up here? The movies just got more and more ridiculous every time. I liked it when the threats and settings felt real, because I could fear for what could happen to the characters. And sad thing is, they had a chance of a having a threat like that with the meteor. But guess why the meteor is gonna hit the Earth? It's because Scrat smashed into it with the space ship. Look, I can suspend my disbelief and believe that Scrat can survive a few falls from a cliff and land in the snow, but surviving in space in nothing but a helmet?I know these are for kids and you should have fun, but at least have it grounded like the first two movies. As a kid I liked that these films weren't just sitcoms with immortal characters, I liked that they could dare to be serious and even be emotional sometimes (like Pixar you could argue). I praised Blue Sky studios for balancing the serious scenes with comedic ones. One of their first short films is called ""Bunny"" and I watched it on the Ice Age VHS tape as one of the bonus features. It's a short that has a lot of heart to it and it had an impact on me.I'm sorry if I'm sounding way too negative here. These are my opinions and I gave the movie a chance, but it lost me as soon as Scrat went to space. I for one don't like how the series has gotten more exaggerated and less true to what the first one did so well. The best thing about it is hearing the original voice actors reprise their roles. The overall animation is pretty nice too."
19,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,14 January 2017,Time to put this franchise on ice forever!,"Original is not a word that comes to mind when watching the fifth (yes FIFTH) entry in this tired, worn, quite frankly burned out franchise.What does come to mind however is the fact this franchise has gone on for far too long.If you can't come up with any original ideas and you have to scrap the deepest barrel for the most unoriginal idea as possible, it's time to go.If you can't keep your characters fresh and funny and make them more boring, dull and annoying to watch, it's time to go.If you're out of jokes to use and you pull some random rabbit out of a hat and it's a rabbit that says ""Think of some really bad jokes mate."", it's time to go.If you have 4 (yes, I do mean 4) writers and not one of them can give any good dialogue out, it's time to go.And when a franchise that is constantly dead in the water is still going like THIS, it's time to go.I don't care if these films still make money, Fox, it's time to put this franchise on ice forever!"
20,Ice Age: Collision Course,6,15 October 2016,series going down,"this movie is total bad movie. The movie does not contain any depth in the story. Really no story at all. total time waste for me, there was a few time where I laughed, but it is merely enough. I am really disappointed the way the series is headed. Ice age 1 was the best and so is Ice age 3. Ice age 2 was OK. I laughed many times for the 4th title that is continental drift but Number 5 i.e. collision course was not met my expectation. The movie is worse than other four movies in the series. I lost my valuable one and a half hour behind this. The production makes this movie as they have to make another sequel. No real sympathy moment in the movie as well. But one thing was good about this movie was Simon peg who voiced buck, I liked buck character from previous movies as well. Overall the movie is flop to me."
21,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,19 December 2016,Milking a dead cow,"You gotta know when to stop. This franchise has run a couple of movies too long. Now concentrating on this movie only, not the franchise, plainly put, it is a bad movie. If you are a die hard fan and want to pick positives and try desperately enough, you can do so. I am not that desperate and I take my movie watching pretty seriously and there is nothing good I can say about this movie. There is no point in going into the plot and dissecting it. Scrat used to be funny, but that seems to be a lifetime back. Sid used to be lovable, but I can't even remember the last time I felt so. There is no life in this cow, let alone milk."
22,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,21 September 2016,Awful,"I am a great fan of Ice Age, however, THIS ONE IS THE WORSE ONE YET! I thought number 4 would be but NOOOOOOOOO, they went on and spoiled it. And what was all that bloody dancing at the end? Is this Hotel Transylvania ?!?NO, NO, NO, NO, NOOOOOOOOO!I hope this is the last movie, because this has become an abomination! They have managed to ruin one the best animated movies out there.Why you not like Shrek and know when to stop? Seriously?These are 2 hours of my life I would never be able to take back! I never comment on such things but Jesus! Are ya mad?And I do love Simon Pegg but he hi-jacked the whole! What the hell! And the moronic mammoth Julian, why did you need to steal the idea from Hotel Transylvania? ARGH!Outraged! Absolutely OUTRAGEDCheers"
23,Ice Age: Collision Course,7,13 July 2016,"Not as Good as the first, but it's still a Nice Age in the new Ice Age","SPOILER ALERT!!!!The buds are back in town! Woo Ho, the gangs all here, Romano, Latifah, Leary, Leguizamo, even that annoying little rat guy. So the story is, our bros are out stuck taking a collision course in school. The ice bros all neglect class when Sid finds a turtle eating it's own feces, and bets the others he won't lick it. Ray Romano goes to class and learns all about the dangers of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases. Al Gore has a surprise role as Professor Snail Gore, which is Al Gore green screened into the movie wearing a snail themed shirt. he and Leary the cat thing get into a HUGE scuffle and Leary ends up ending Gore's life. In order to do right in the universe, the gang gets in a time machine and each wear a costume made out of Gore's skin, to appear as him for presidential duties in the 90's. Then its pretty great how it ties together when Romano the mammoth spreads his knowledge and eventually reveals his identity as Actor Ray Romano doing voice over for an animated movie. ""I got a pretty fat paycheck actually, It's no Pixar but, what're you gonna do, right?"" It was a truly splendid affair. every cast member was great. Sid did a funny thing when he almost smothers the infant trying to get a free Nutter-butter candy. and the rat guy, he p's me off. get the dang nut you dope. quit wasting my damn time. all in all great, would love an ""exterminated"" cut where they remove the rat scenes, make me sick."
24,Ice Age: Collision Course,9,6 August 2016,"Welcome back, Buck! Fun, heartwarming adventure.","This series is a firm favourite, due to its lovable characters, great animation and sense of fun. Simon Pegg makes a welcome return as the swashbuckling Buck, stealing every scene he's in. Scrat has new misadventures in space; while the Herd race against time to save the Earth. There are new villains and love interests introduced, plus other creatures, but the film never feels overcrowded. (Unlike in The Pirate Adventure.) Diego is left on the sidelines, but will hopefully have a bigger role if they make a 6th instalment. I love the humour and the heartwarming moments. Perhaps the next step is to re-introduce Roshan (the baby from the original)."
25,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,16 March 2017,The Worst Ice Age Film In the Franchise,"Now I like the first Ice Age and I considered It one of the great animated classics, when the sequels came In and I know this may sound predicable but they are not as good as the original, however they are fine as they are, they are not the worst, but fun to watch. However!, with this one, THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST IN THE FRANCHISE!, the story is stupid and lazy, the characters are unfunny, pointless and really dumb, the jokes are so juvenile and unfitting.The only really good things about this movie is the animation looks fantastic, Scrat's still really funny, I'm so happy that Buck has returned and Is still being the funny Weasel he is and Brooke and the Dino-Birds are kind of.. tolerable I guess, but It don't matter because the film is just... UNNECESSARY!!!.Please don't watch this film, this is the one that made Ice Age a cash crabbing franchise and like Family Guy and the Simpsons, It now has run out of ideas, I wouldn't blame It on Blue-Sky, It's all Fox's fault!.And yes you can guess I'm giving this a 3/10."
26,Ice Age: Collision Course,9,1 October 2016,A gorgeous and greatly entertaining FAMILY movie for all ages,"People seem to be taking this franchise way too seriously for its own good... some seem to dislike the puns and the jokes, only seeing how simple they are, all the while completely disregarding how hilarious they still are. The Ice Age movie series is a FAMILY one, meaning it was created for your typical Saturday night with your kids, as a way to bond with them and have fun together - something even Manny learns to understand in this movie. For this Ice Age movie, the kids will laugh at the silly animation and lighthearted jokes as well as the main gang's (mis-)adventures while the parents could almost reflect on their own parenting - and maybe notice the hidden jokes only they could understand.Overall, this is a great Ice Age movie, one that I think pays homage to the original film way better than the previous, who if anything was trying too hard to be a typical mainstream animation movie. This one is really relaxed and true to its predecessors, and all 94mn of it will just fly by, not just because of the gorgeous fur rendering and landscape reflection and design the animation team did - although props to them - but because this is a movie that knows what it is - nothing less yet nothing more than a typical, fun FAMILY movie - a fact some other reviewers seem to have forgotten, and who would compare it to a Disney Pixar production."
27,Ice Age: Collision Course,8,7 August 2016,A very funny and entertaining movie,It's one of the funniest animated movie that i've ever watched.I was laughing throughout the whole movie.Scrat was the most cute and likable character who did the most comedy once again. He was still on hunt to hold onto his beloved acorn and while doing so he almost destroys the whole world. Space adventures of scrat were just hilariously funny. Sid was still in search for his true love while ellie and manny were having family issues with her daughter and her boyfriend.Buck again appears in this sequeal which was really a surprise element.I'd rate it as the best sequel of the ice age. I was worried that this one could not be as hilarious as others were but after watching it i am so glad that i was worried for nothing. The 3d effects were awesome as one could expect from blue sky. Since that the only reason i went cinema to watch it and it was really worth the money. I'd strongly recommend this movie to all animated movie fans.
28,Ice Age: Collision Course,8,26 July 2016,Fox MegaCorp graciously steps into the breech . . .,". . . created when the genii it has conjured to Rule the Free World, America's President-Elect Trump, spent all his National Convention time prattling about Doom and Gloom, forgetting to outline any Practical Solutions to the Apocalyptic Picture that he painted. Fox's ICE AGE: COLLISION COURSE neatly plugs this hole in planning out the World's Future. When the Convention ended Thursday night, the World wondered HOW the U.S. could fix its infrastructure, solve Global Warming, cure Zika, pay Social Security and Medicare to hordes of aging Baby Boomers, increase Military spending, finance a Great Wall of Canada to balance the one that Mexico's paying for in order to avoid Continental Imbalance\Fracturing, help poor Americans to defend themselves with government-provided Gun Stamps, put people on Mars, get doctors to do for free what ObamaCare is doing, and keep China in its place. Fortunately, on Friday COLLISION COURSE showed us that the Trumpsters will accomplish all of this and more through Magic Crystals, Unicorns, and Fountains of Youth. After seeing COLLISION COURSE, I feel that all of us can rest easy now."
29,Ice Age: Collision Course,7,9 July 2016,"""Collision Course"" Exceeds The Low Expectations","The prehistoric animals most successful in the animation films return to the movie theaters for fifth time, now, the end of the world is their great concern.""Collision Course"" is titled the last adventure of the franchise most recalcitrant in the animated world - with reference to revenue at the box office -. What started as a emotional and poignant incident more than one decade ago, has evolved admirably, but not always with satisfactory results. The fifth installment opens with a shameful but entertaining prologue focused on the endless mishaps that suffer our saber-toothed squirrel, Scrat (Chris Wedge), mishaps that leading him to outer space, seemingly, a safe place, however, Scrat continues his battle causing a chaotic clash of worlds, projecting millions of purple meteors to planet Earth, endangering the life of all animals.Indisputably, Scrat is Blue Sky's emblem, what is Buzz Lightyear or Nemo for Pixar. Regardless of the frequency of his appearances, he always maintains his crazy and stimulating essence in each act, and without him, it would not be possible more films in the saga. Screenwriters and writers have discovered the rough gem that was hidden since 2002, a small and irritating animal, focusing on each plot twist as a consequence of the facts carried out by the squirrel, one point in favor. ""Ice Age"" still has future and even with Pixar (""Finding Dory"") and Illumination (""The Secret Life of Pets"") on the look-out, Many, Diego and Sid have high possibilities to continue with the winning streak at the box office, at least, that seems.The fate of prehistoric mammals has been relatively good, and it seems that everyone (with exceptions) live in pairs. Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) face the rapid maturity of their daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), who is in a kind of relationship with Julian (Adam Devine). A sub-plot anything original and very predictable, since Julian did not get along with Manny, but yes he got along with others, unleashing the envy and jealous of the mammoth, and if there is someone so naive, it has a happy ending. Nothing new!. Diego (Denis Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez), the saber-tooth tigers, get supporting roles and their characteristics fades for a moment, besides, the screenwriters give clues of a possible litter between these two tigers in one scene, something that continues leading it astray. They should perhaps rethink the spin-offs about a character in specific, for not to damage to generational characters. Sid (John Leguizamo) is still in an emotional imbalance, something by what we love him, much of the comedy is centered in this cute animal that will continue producing loud laughs for the rest of our lives. The opossums, Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) remain comical objects used for the humor of the film. Buck (Simon Pegg), the star of ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is infuriating, cumbersome and rough, his jokes and eccentricities did not entertain children nor adults, a character who has to be eliminated immediately. Despite this, he's who predicts the catastrophe, and he's who attracts new, humiliating and poor villains, more filler unnecessary to the story.With the seriousness of a cataclysm and so witty characters, Mike Thurmeier and Galen T. Chu recreate a balance between comedy and drama, unbalancing briefly because of Buck. It still is space for moments unique and even memorable, but in a epoch in where is difficult find interesting proposals, ""Collision Course"" comes off well rid, despite its reused plot. The teachings are also present, the acceptance of a father to the maturity of his daughter, a young's independence, over-protection errors and family work are some of the lessons that the movie wants to assert.Soundscapes doesn't reach the visual spectacle that has been regenerated with the passing years, however, it achieves the ambitions proposed. Purple's tonality of the shooting stars , the textures of reptiles and mammals, effects in the sky, the brightness of Geotopia and more details open a privileged place to position itself as a nice addition to the animated world. New characters are insufficient and none manages to deliver what they promised, so it leaves on a slope to the likely next sequel. We want to continue to seeing what it is capable of providing that ice age that once shook us, those mammals, who still do not deserve to die out."
30,Ice Age: Collision Course,7,9 July 2016,Fun and laughs for the kids,"Ice Age: Collision Course is the fifth instalment in one of the longest animated franchises of all time. Kids will definitely enjoy this humour-filled film, but the adults will be less amused by the stereotypical animated comedy. It's not perfect, but it's definitely a great end to the Ice Age series.There's no way to start an Ice Age film without our favourite squirrel, Scrat. In his attempts to hide his acorn, he ends up in a flying saucer and then space, setting off a chain of events that send an asteroid hurtling towards Earth.On Earth, each character is having a host of problems, a tradition to the start of every Ice Age movie. Of course, all these petty matters are turned awry when a meteor shower comes pouring down from the heavens. But that's just the beginning; a huge asteroid as big as the one that wiped out the dinosaurs is speeding towards the planet.And so starts off a series of events in the gang's quest to somehow stop the huge asteroid from colliding with Earth and wiping out life as we know it. The return of Buck from Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was a great choice. As he did in Ice Age 3, he's back at the front of the pack leading the way to stopping the asteroid. His lunatics and plain insanity are funny, bound to garner laughs from everyone.The antagonists of this story, a trio of flying dinosaurs, are fairly weak in their influence and overall ''scariness''. While they are a little threatening in the short amount of screen time they receive, they lack a certain menacing feel to them, only supported by how quickly they turn to the ''good side'' by the end. Considering how good a job was done on making Captain Gutt, from Ice Age 4: Continental Drift, scary, this trio could have done with some work.The story of Sid falling in love with Brooke, a new character, is also fairly abysmal, more so than that of Diego and Shira in the previous movie. It's unrealistic; they propose for marriage only after 12 minutes! Clearly this hastiness is part of the joke, but this is still an evident attempt by the writers to cram more into the film. Even so, it's great to see Sid find the love of his life...finally!The Shangri Llama, which featured in the trailer, falls completely flat, barely making any screen time in the film. He's supposedly meant to save the entire pack from the asteroid. But when he does make an appearance, he's a whingey, demanding character that if anything does a better job at antagonising than the three dinosaurs.One of the more obvious underlying themes of the story features Manny and his typical over-protectiveness over Peaches, who has just gotten engaged with her fiancé Julian, another new character. The morals of trust are explored, even if a little too quickly, between Manny and his to-be son-in-law Julian, along with faith between Manny and Ellie, and their daughter Peaches.The biggest (and possibly only) improvement on Ice Age 1 is the high quality animation, which is obviously a given considering the 15-year gap between the films.Starting off with 3 main protagonists in Ice Age 1, this film now has almost ten. This brings with it less screen time for some characters. As was the case with the antagonists and the Shangri Llama, Diego saw barely any time in the limelight. The writers attempt to create a story of how Diego, alongside Shira, want to have children but can't due to how scary they appear to kids, but again this story completely dissolves away.Perhaps this is the biggest problem with Ice Age 5; there's quite a lot going on. It's not that it is hard to follow, more so that not enough time can be spent exploring the most important themes, which is partially the problem in all the other Ice Age sequels. Ice Age 1 found this delicate balance, however with the addition of so many characters since, this clearly became difficult.Ice Age 5 is a film the entire family can enjoy, but it's definitely more suited towards the younger children. This film is not perfect, not even close to reaching the quality of Pixar films, but considering it is the 4th sequel that's understandable. In the end, it's just another Ice Age movie, and you're bound to enjoy this one if you've enjoyed any of the other sequels. It has humour, romance and moralistic themes, and is a film that's enough to entertain the family."
31,Ice Age: Collision Course,7,4 July 2016,Could this be the last Ice Age movie ever?,"Yesterday I went to see this(the preview) in the cinemas as I have seen all 4 of the previous films,and since I am a huge animated buff I treated my younger brother to it and my mom who likes some animated films. Ice Age: Collision Course is the 5th installment(and maybe the final Ice Age film of the series who knows right)and this time Scratty the squirrel is up in space trying to get the acorn(once again)causing a meteor strike to arrive on Earth,causing mayhem for Mammy and his gang. They later team up with Buck(from Ice Age 3)and they stumble across the meteor which is magnetic,and they meet up with some engaging characters that are centuries old(one voiced by English singer Jessie J)who becomes a so called love interest to Sid. So will Mammy and the gang be able to save their place from destruction.Bottom line this was a pretty decent animated film. I was amazed how far the series has reached as the first two the animated was terrible and then the next few the animation got better. If you ask me I think this was a total cash cow in for Blue Sky Studios,it was unnecessary to release yet another Ice Age movie and who knows there might be another one coming in the next 7 odd years mark my words.Overall I thought it was good and my family all enjoyed it which was the main thing.7/10C+"
32,Ice Age: Collision Course,6,25 July 2016,"OK sequel. Very Standard, everything you love about Ice Age, if you love it. (and nothing more).","Here we go again! Milking everything you got out of a franchise. They say this is the final chapter of Ice Age, but we'll see how much money it makes to be sure.Nothing overly imaginative about the film as the tribe attempt to survive a big rock about to hit Earth.It was filled with good jokes that made me laugh hard throughout. It better with comedians like Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary and Simon Pegg, voicing the main charters. Although, four sequels made for too many main characters for any of the all-star cast to fully shine .The animation was good, but nothing new stood out (I hear it only takes eight mouths to do these movies)but I really like the character design. Plus it's worth seeing for some great 3D images.But the film works best if you are a huge fan of the ones before it(especially if your a fan of Scat, the saber tooth squirrel who has particularly created the entire universe in an effort to get that nut) . Without having that connection, it's a bit bland.http://cinemagardens.com/?p=78"
33,Ice Age: Collision Course,7,24 July 2016,A Collision of Kiddy Fun and Bland Plots:,"Sequels, sequels, sequels! It seems that the only thing that Hollywood wants to make is a sequel these days, at least in the animation world. And what franchise is a better example of this than Ice Age. Years ago, the idiotic animal cast warmed our hearts with an adventure that was fun, funny, and cute. Over a decade later, the adventure still continues, but it has now crossed over into the ridiculous zone (especially with the last movie Continental Drift). Nevertheless, we have the fifth installment dropped onto our laps and yours truly is back into the theater to give you some insight. Let's get started.The GOOD  Same cute feeling to it  Voice Acting is just as good as always  Science behind the magic  Return of BuckNo surprise, Ice Age remains cute to appeal to the target audience of families. Manny (Ray Romano) and his crew continue to stumble, bash, and insult each other in a manner that is kid friendly and semi-entertaining. Your little ones will be laughing in high-pitched delight as Sid is smacked, Scrat is consistently punished, and insults fly through the air in some ridiculous screaming manner. Yep despite the new gags, it certainly feels like an Ice Age Movie. And when the comedy dries down to a trickle, there are those touching moments, well there are those heart warming, morale filled sequences that will make you say Awwwww. While the dialogue and storyboard have certainly set the groundwork for the silliness, it is the voice acting that brings it to life. For this reviewer, John Leguizamo (Sid) was my leading voice as he delivers consistently stupidity and forlorn through the movie. Ray Romano's sarcasm and timing help support this, but Manny's role has been reduced ever since the birth of his daughter. As for the rest of the cast, well they do their parts justice, despite the limited characters they play, but not enough to call props on (more on that later). The exception to this is Neil deGrasse Tyson (Buck). Once more Tyson brings energy, whit and well-timed delivery that we loved in the third installment. Buck is just as chaotic as you remember, which often leads to action and genius wrapping into a product that continues to be impressive. And in this installment, Buck brings a lot of scientific principal, some realistic and others purely a stretch of imagination, that can at least stimulate some thoughts. It's an engaging character one I hope to see in the inevitable sequel to come. The BAD:  The characters are not balanced  Crossed into kiddie zone way too much  Rushed story with pointless bad guysThe biggest thing I had an issue with, was how disproportionate the characters were in this movie. It's no surprise that as the cast continues to expand, there is less time for each character to make a worthy contribution. Ice Age has officially hit that road focusing again on the Mammoths and Scrat and forgoing most of the other characters. Sure Sid and Buck get their fair share, but the other characters are reduced to only a few lines of dialogue and nothing more (I'm talking about your character Jennifer Lopez). Such unbalanced character emphasis is a flaw for me and like many of the characters we need to move on from them rather than pointlessly include them. As mentioned earlier, the movie is family fun, but each installment continues to go deeper into the kiddie pool. Crash and Eddy have been reduced to very stupid humor that involves mindless banter and getting into fights. Manny's filter has been set to full power as his adult jokes have been reduced to just straight up bitterness. Even Sid has managed to dumb down his comedy so that is kid friendly. Wanda Sykes' edge that we got in the fourth film had flare and sassiness, but they limited that role so much in this installment. Therefore, the adult spectacle of the first Ice Age continues to be lost with each continued sequel. Finally, we address the villains of the movie. The new cast members in the film have great voice work, when they are actually on the screen. However, the raptor birds of this movie have little danger, edge, or even threat compared to the natural disaster careening towards Earth. In the first few movies, the villains that were hunting our crew had bite, edge, and terror. These villains were just sad, and another medium for comedic ploys. Throw in a rather rushed and blunt tale with a hastily concluded ending and you only get further lack of suspense. The VERDICTIce Age: Collision Course is certainly continuing the trend we've seen in the series. While it is certainly kiddie, it is still somewhat entertaining and funny, and not the worst of the five movies. However, it still is not anything like the first Ice Age and the studio should think about dropping it to Netflix for the future instead of polling it in theaters. Therefore you can guess it probably isn't worth a trip to the theater, and certainly not in 3-D. As a result, my scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 6.5-7.0 Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0"
34,Ice Age: Collision Course,8,6 September 2016,Not bad,"Ice Age: Collision Course is an animated comedy adventure film directed by Mike Thurmeier. Stars the voices of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah, Keke Palmer, Jennifer Lopez, Simon Pegg and Chris Wedge, returning, and the new voices of Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Adam DeVine, Nick Offerman, Max Greenfield, Stephanie Beatriz, Melissa Rauch, Michael Strahan, Jessie J and Neil deGrasse Tyson. The movie follows the old crew of Manny and his family Ellie and Peaches, Sid, Diego and his wife Shira plus some friendly faces come back, such as Buck who was first presented in the third movie. After many adventures together, now the crew has to escape an asteroid that is headed towards them. This is a fun family friendly adventure that is definitely more on the focus of kids but adults can have some laughs here and there too. I get why a lot of people hated on this film, it is the 5th one in the franchise and the formula has become too obvious at this point. It's easy to just hate this film and be comfortable saying I HATED IT, it sucks there is nothing good about it, they should just stop making these, BUT the matter of the fact is that this is a better film than the last one, and just okay overall. The animation is really good actually, and most of the characters are likable, especially Buck voiced by Simon Pegg. He's funny and moves the story forward in a very fast pace. Also the messages and lessons that this movie has are very much for families, and that is great. There is pretty much nothing offensively bad about this film. and while some jokes do not hit and the story is pretty generic, still it is mostly meant for kids and in that regard it works."
35,Ice Age: Collision Course,6,16 July 2016,Wonderful film...but only to keep a 6 yr old quiet!,"I'm a confirmed cinema bachelor. Never happier than schlepping along to my local multiplex as a carefree movie mad singleton, I ignore the over-priced confectionery, ice creams and soft drinks, content to buy a ticket only and save my wallet and pancreas a regretful ache later on.A five year could never avoid such sugary seduction. Before I had even bought our tickets, my six year old nephew and I had visited a sweet shop to select a pot of teeth-destroying, but oh so satisfying penny chews (yes, I tried some), a huge bag of sweet pop corn, a bottle of blueberry flavoured water and a lengthy discussion about what my nephew wanted to eat at McDonald's afterwards (he needed something savoury to wash down all of the sugar)."
36,Ice Age: Collision Course,6,16 July 2016,You should've kept it in the Freezer,"I know that there will be people that will like this, I noticed this, but for me, I kind of wanted more. The story in this movie is pretty generic and cliché, especially impressing and bonding with the Father and a tip that happened earlier pops up. And even though the characters can get annoying, I really like Buck, Crash and Eddie, those characters are the best moments from this movie, Manny, Sid and Diego are really tolerable, but once again we have a guy who's still pretty stupid. The best thing about this movie is the animation, it looks like all the characters are popping with energy and the scenery looks really good, granted there may be a couple of problems especially when they attempt to do grossout, but it's really tolerable. But one issue about this movie is that granted, children may find scenes funny, but parents and adults would find the jokes very juvenile, unfortunately, since that's what animated movies are now, it gets boring at times. So this is just Okay, I have seen MUCH better animated movies, but if you are an Ice Age fan, check it out, you'll get some giggles, but if you want to judge as a movie, just try and have fun, I think that's what it's trying to do."
37,Ice Age: Collision Course,7,28 July 2016,It'll Ice You,"Ice Age: Collision Course is a good film with excellent animation, laugh-out-loud comedy and includes all your fun and favorite characters from the past movies. The film follows Manny (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), Diego (Denis Leary) and the rest of the Ice Age gang as they must divert an asteroid from flinging them into a new age called extinction. My favorite character in Ice Age: Collision Course is Scrat (Chris Wedge) who started out as a small character in the first Ice Age film and slowly became a fan favorite and the mascot of the franchise. Scrat lights up the screen every scene he is in. His brand of slapstick humor is more present here than in any other Ice Age film. I even kind of sympathize with this character because he goes through all this trouble just for an acorn. Another character I like is Buck. Simon Pegg's talent really shines in his voice over work here. Buck has a big personality and, just like Scrat, has some of the movie's most memorable laughs. He is in a lot of my favorite sequences. My favorite part of this film is when Buck tries to find a strategy to save the mammals from disaster. He seeks help from personalities in his mind including Neil deBuck Weasel. I'm a big fan of a television show Neil deGrasse Tyson did called Cosmos, so it was funny to see his foray into voice acting. This movie is a pleasant surprise considering this is the fifth film in the franchise. I thought by now the series had run dry, but this one excels on several fronts in terms of how it looks and how much it will make you laugh. I recommend you see this in 3D. It was cool seeing asteroids barreling towards me. The effects are very polished. The computer animation in this film excels and mixes lush backgrounds with great character design. The film has good comedy, most of the time. There are one or two scenes in this film that take the joke one step too far or where it is just plain gross. I give Ice Age: Collision Course an age rating of 5 to 18 because of some crude humor and sequences that could be scary to younger viewers. I give Ice Age: Collision Course 3 out of 5 stars."
38,Ice Age: Collision Course,6,3 August 2016,Not what I was expecting!,"Here we go again! Milking everything you got out of a franchise.

39,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,27 December 2016,Where has this gone?,"""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is the fifth Ice Age movie in the adventures of the ice Age crew. Once again the earth is about to collide and they're set to save the world. This time a huge asteroid coming towards the earth and Manny, Sid and Diego joins up with Buck who have a crazy idea to save the world.The fifth Ice Age film is probably the worst and hopefully the last film in the movie-series. It has gone to far. I remember the first movie to have a charm the other movies couldn't obtain. Anyway the movie had a few funny moments, but the story and the cheesy characters and humour just made this worse than I had expected. I miss the old grumpy Manny and the slink Diego. They have changed a lot since we meet them first time back in 2002. the whole world have changed from being an ice cold almost desolate landscape to a green and populated place where all the animals act like humans. Not like they did in the first move, and that have me thinking why this movie went so wrong. I really hope they're not making more sequels to this, because they've killed the universe I once saw as one of the best animated movies. The animation failed nothing. It's beautiful and have lots of details. But I think it's sad the story was so bad and cheesy.""Ice Age - Collision Course"" is not a movie i enjoyed. They should have stopped making these movies after the second. Not a good movie. ""Ice Age - Collision Course"" gets 4/10 stars"
40,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,24 September 2016,"Mostly boring, not funny and insulting the intelligence of the viewer.","Oh my, that was a mess. All four of us prepared for at least a nice entertaining movie, but one of us even walked out, it's so disappointing!The story is too simple, dialogues are bad and many times we were looking at each other like what the ... I doubt even kids will watch this movie again, I would advice them not to do that and watch a simple cartoon instead.There is so much wrong with this movie that I cannot even appreciate the things that are good, like the voice acting. The best part of the movie is Scratch, not every scene but that actually made me laugh at times. It should have been a 5 minute short with only Scratch and it would have gotten an easy 7 or 8 out of 10. But anything happening on earth was boring, not funny and actually in a way insulting the intelligence of the viewer.Okay, animation and voice acting were obviously good, but that didn't survive the absolute mess of the whole movie. It would have been great to just have the asteroid kill each and everyone of these characters so that there will never be another Ice Age movie - please stop this torture and invent something new, this was a waste of your money and my time. A 3,5 for Scratch so 4/10."
41,Ice Age: Collision Course,6,8 September 2016,"Great adventure, not as good as previous films...","I'm a big fan of the Ice Age films and I have to say I enjoyed this one. Original story, lots of funny moments, great new characters, great ending. I also like the fact that Buck is brought back in the story.However, through out the film I had a feeling that something was missing. The film mostly focuses on a few characters like Buck, Manny, Peaches while forgetting about Diego, Shira, Crash and Eddie. It felt like they are there just going along with the squad without playing an important role.I think more work could have been done, maybe add some details about the story of each character. That could have added a better flow to the story.Overall a good Film. 6/10"
42,Ice Age: Collision Course,6,31 August 2016,Hilarious!,"Okay, so I will be honest. Ice Age Collision Course wasn't really needed, and we could have lived without it, unless we were driving on a stupendous plane that would have thrilled us beyond limit like Pixar movies generally do. Despite the apparent, Ice Age: Collision Course still manages to pull it off, owing to their awesome sense of snappy humour and their fascinating CGI that makes everything appear stunning.PLOT OF ICE AGE COLLISION COURSE Ice Age Collision Course comes with a very banal plot. The implausibility of Ice Age keeps on degrading as we caper towards exploring new parts of the franchise. Maybe Blue Sky Studios have been milking its installments too much, so much that they are actually running out of material. No doubt there is always humour galore in their work, but at one point it becomes kind of pointless when there is nothing in their baggage and they still try to squeeze every bit to make jokes out of thin air.The plot of Ice Age Collision Course is something as dumb as Scrat messing around with the universe. That's what he does. He keeps showing up throughout the movie to accidentally mess with the fate of the planet. Things that avalanche therefrom aren't exactly what we were expecting. It toys with everything  the story-line, the credibility, jokes, everything! BEST BITS TO REMEMBER Remember Buck? Well, the awesome weasel is here as well, and he is probably one of the best things about the movie. Simon Pegg returns to voice the one-eyed chap who will take you on a joyride to saving the planet. He is just the way we left him in the prequels. Totally loco! A side plot of JulianPeaches story was an impending steer, which was quite thoughtful. It tried to give the story a perspective and a good direction. Granny returns once again with her incessant nagging which never bores you. Oh and we should never forget the true antihero of Ice Age franchise, Scrat who always brings hilarity to no matter what he does.THE FINAL VERDICT I say the humour is way better than what the Angry Birds movie came up with. If you liked that you are definitely going to love this. If you didn't, well, you are still going to like Ice Age Collision Course for its magnificent animation and rib-tickling humour.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com"
43,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,21 September 2016,Terrible,"This movie is a complete disaster. By far the worst movie in the series and I only hope they are not going to make another one. The series has certainly ran its course and it is time to end it. Too bad it will end with THIS but the next one will probably be even worse (if something worse is even possible).There are no funny moments at all. I tried to laugh, I tried to find some positives but no matter how hard I tried I was unable to.The trailers show all the funny moments, the rest is just boring, and I really mean boring.Save your money and take your family to watch something else instead. You will be bored, and I am quite sure your kids will also be bored.It is really upsetting that such a great series ended up like this."
44,Ice Age: Collision Course,10,14 October 2016,You really must be a bad person if you don't enjoy this movie...,"I just saw it. As a 39 years old I enjoyed this movie so much! The big surprise was right from the first minutes when I recognized the voice of Neil Degrasse Tyson. The scientific explanations he delivers through his character in this movie are incredible hilarious. I literally had tears in my eyes from so much laughing. The movie is fun and very entertaining. I really don t understand the bad critics and the low note on IMDb. What are ppl expecting from such a movie? It s a cartoon with talking prehistoric animals where mammoths are friends with slots and tigers... Everything was funny as hell. What is wrong with you ppl? I get it, the old Jungle book was a great cartoon, Up was an incredible and emotional cartoon made by Pixar, but Ice Age is something else. I don t want drama and tears and complex morals from Ice Age, I want to feel like a kid and laugh and I did that. And I laughed even more than a kid because as an adult I can understand the astrophysics and science parody from this movie which was presented by no one else than professor Tyson....Ending the review here, I know I am not good at reviews but I had to write these thoughts after I saw all the negativity surrounding this movie..."
45,Ice Age: Collision Course,9,27 October 2016,Way better than i heard..,"Manny, Diego, and Sid join up with Buck to fend off a meteor strike that would destroy the world. Ice Age Collision Course is by no means a masterpiece and honestly it's not even as good as previous films in the series BUT that doesn't mean it's a bad film it has action, it has drama and the same friends once more doing their weird stuff although the movie has problems too mostly with some moments where a character is singing or some out of nowhere dream sequence but still not a bad film if you have kids rent the DVD and have some Family Fun together and i think the parents will enjoy it also but watch it with low expectations."
46,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,14 September 2016,Family or asteroid: what is the main problem?,"The main characteristic of ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is constancy: it sucks from the beginning till the end. Is there any normal story at all? I haven't found any. The whole movie is a sheer silliness with a mass of uncovered nonsense. Children won't understand it. Adults will get bored in no time. While watching I kept thinking what happened to the one of the funniest and cool animation franchises.Trailer promised us great adventure. Great asteroid is reaching Earth! They must be afraid, run, find a place to hide. No. The creators don't think it's important. Let's focus on much more important problems. What about family and love? Sid cannot find a girl. Diego with his girlfriend doubt whether they will be good parents, and Manny don't like his daughter's choice. Who cares about meteorite? In other words, ""Ice Age"" has become a sitcom or even soap opera since sitcom should be funny. I advise you not to show ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" to your child. There are a bunch of much better movies with morality, good jokes and story."
47,Ice Age: Collision Course,2,18 February 2017,It's clear that the franchise is done,"Yes, you read the title correctly. A fifth entry into the series which began in 2002 with Ice Age somehow stumbled onto cinema screens last year to find that even the target audience may have become fatigued by the increasingly cuddly and decreasingly funny franchise, as its box office pulled in far fewer dollars than was expected. You would be forgiven if you weren't even aware of this movie, as I doubt even the most loyal of fans were screaming out for more following the limp Continental Drift in 2012. Having covered just about every historical disaster to hit the globe without any sense of timeline, writers Michael J. Wilson, Michael Berg and Yoni Brenner have decided to make one up, and that is after sending one of its most recognisable characters into space.That character is Scrat, the saber-tooth squirrel whose neverending quest to get his hands on that evasive acorn always proved to be a welcome distraction whenever the central story became too tedious or sentimental. After stumbling upon an alien spaceship glimpsed in the first movie, he accidentally switches it on and is blasted into the cosmos, playing pinball with the planets and forming the Milky Way. Before you can say ""hey, that doesn't make any sense!"", Scrat sends a meteorite hurtling towards Earth, just as Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) realises he has forgotten his anniversary while stressing about his grown-up daughter's relationship with the goofy Julian (Adam Devine). Collision Course is happy to meander along like a prehistoric sitcom.It's quite clear that directors Mike Thurmeier and Galen T. Chu are convinced that by simply throwing more characters into this already overstuffed universe will distract the audience from the sheer lack of imagination and actual jokes. Returning are Ellie (Queen Latifah), Manny's wife; ground sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) who is feeling lovelorn after being dumped; saber-tooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary), who seems to be teaching his girlfriend Shira (Jennifer Lopez) that eating meat is bad; opossum brothers and comic-relief Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck); and wise-cracking screwball Granny (Wanda Sykes). As the meteor heads closer to Earth, the Herd come across Buck (Simon Pegg), the unhinged weasel still living in the secret Jurassic world last seen in Dawn of the Dinosaurs, who inadvertently invites a trio of p****d-off dromaeosaurs (voiced by Nick Offerman, Stephanie Beatiz and Max Greenfield) onto their trail. It's all too much - Lopez must have about 5 lines throughout the entire film - and I'm not even covering the new set of characters introduced near the end.There's plenty of forward momentum and what must be a world-record of fart and a**e gags to distract unfussy children, but there is next to nothing to keep the grown-up audience entertained. In an age where The Lego Movie can make profound statements about the nature of corporate culture and Zootopia can ask some serious questions about race relations, you would find deeper life-lessons in an episode of The King of Queens than you will find in Collision Course. Demonstrating an understanding of the laws of physics on par with Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, the education here is purely familial, with Manny undergoing the same learning curve as he has in every previous instalment. While the animation may be lovely and polished, the sheer lack of effort by Blue Sky Studios to deliver anything but a piece of colourful fluff to keep the cash machine fully stocked and operational is unforgivable. When you find yourself rooting for the asteroid to end of this nonsense once and for all, it's clear that the franchise is done."
48,Ice Age: Collision Course,,23 April 2017,Too many Ice Age Sequels!,"I honestly feel like they should have stopped after the 3rd movie. But they made two more movies which are not good. They probably are making a sixth movie. Each movie they get worse. I think that the first couple movies were good but this one had flawed logic. I don't want to spoil the plot, but it is not accurate. And I know it's marketed towards kids but it makes no sense. Sid is just as annoying and pathetic. Manny is still an overprotective father. Is there any character development. This film was a shameless cash grab. It wasn't very popular. Good actors but bland characters."
49,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,19 March 2017,What a waste!,"Some animated movies cry out for sequels...'Finding Nemo', 'Toy Story', even 'Shrek' are but a few. But 'Ice Age', now with its FOURTH sequel, is definitely not one of them!The premise is moronic, even for a children's movie. Scrat, looking for someplace to bury his acorn, activates an abandoned alien ship that launches asteroids destined to collide with Earth. At the same time, Manny is worried about his daughter Peaches upcoming wedding, Sid is dumped by his girlfriend Francine, and Diego and Shira want to start a family - but are afraid their appearance might be too scary for kids. And there are several other ridiculous plots going on at the same that do nothing but confuse little viewers.Although I loved the original ""Ice Age"", and even the first sequel or two, this fifth submission was obviously made just to exploit a few more bucks out of movie go-ers pockets. Note to studio: NO NUMBER SIX!!!"
50,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,23 February 2017,Tipping/melting ice point,"We're near a point now, where I do wonder what else they can come up with? Where else are they going to send our group of misfits. And how long was the Ice Age exactly? Shouldn't it be over by now? Still it's always great to see our favorite squirrel (Scrat) and his never-ending quest - I know, Nuts, right? I couldn't resist, sorry.Apart from obvious jokes, family issues (how to deal with your daughter and all that drama), we have another journey ahead of us. While it is entertaining enough to watch, there is a point where it feels like we've been here before. Not literally, but just in the sense of peril and how our heroes are going about to solve their problems and everyone else too. Still for kids it's enough to keep them occupied"
51,Ice Age: Collision Course,,3 February 2017,"Yet another Ice Age movie, just about wearing out its welcome.","We saw this at home on DVD from our public library. About halfway through my wife commented ""This is not as good as the first one."" True, nor as good as the second one, or the third one, etc.Part of the initial enjoyment was the novelty of the various wild animals getting along in prehistoric times, during the Ice Ages. Never mind that the actual chronology is inaccurate. In fact there is an 8- minute ""extra"" on the DVD where Astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson addresses a number of the ""scientific"" points in this animated movie and explains why they might be grossly different from reality. All in fun of course. He even voices one of the characters.Where the other movies featured a short segment of Scrat getting into a bind, the story here in essence features Scrat's bind within the core story. Because of Scrat's ineptness he accidentally sets in motion events that created the Solar System as we know it, forming Jupiter's giant red spot, formation of the asteroid belt, the moon's orbiting around the Earth, and a few others.The big one amounted to an asteroid that would hit Earth soon and result in another mass extinction, all because of Scrat's ineptness. So all the animals on Earth have to pool their wisdom and strength to divert the asteroid.It runs 90 minutes and often gets tedious, the core story interrupted by sight gags and short vignettes. I laughed a few times but if I had never seen this movie it would not have been a significant loss."
52,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,21 November 2016,"I liked the film, but of course I didn't love it.","'ICE AGE: COLLISION COURSE': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fifth installment in the 'ICE AGE' computer-animated movie franchise (which began in 2002). This one tells the story of Manny, and his Paleolithic mammal friends, trying to stop a meteor strike from destroying the planet. It once again stars the voice talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Simon Pegg, Seann William Scott, Josh Peck, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Lopez, Wanda Sykes and Chris Wedge (all reprising their roles from other movies); while newcomers Adam DeVine, Keke Palmer, Nick Offerman, Max Greenfield, Stephanie Beatriz and Neil deGrasse Tyson all join the cast. The film was directed by Mike Thurmeier (who also co-directed the last two 'ICE AGE' movies) and Galen T. Chu; and it was written by Michael Wilson, Michael Berg, Yoni Brenner and Aubrey Solomon (all mostly experienced animated film writers, some working on other 'ICE AGE' movies). It got mostly horrible reviews from critics, but it was a big hit at the international Box Office. I think it's about as good as I expected it to be. Scrat (Wedge) is still trying to catch that acorn; and in the process he accidentally launches himself into space (in an abandoned alien spaceship). While in space, he then accidentally causes several asteroids to head towards earth. When Manny (Romano), Sid (Leguizamo), Diego (Leary), and the rest of their mammal friends, learn of their coming doom, they set out to stop the asteroids. A trio of angry dromaeosaurs then set out to stop them. The movie is about as good as the rest of the 'ICE AGE' sequels; maybe not quite as good (but I can't really remember the others). I know I enjoyed the original quite a bit, and I think the entire franchise is decent. There's definitely a lot of silly jokes in them, but some of the humor is kind of funny; you also have to like the voice cast, and Scrat is definitely always amusing. This film also has a really insightful line about veganism (some positive social commentary in a kids movie)! I liked the film, but of course I didn't love it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/193849869"
53,Ice Age: Collision Course,6,24 October 2016,This time the trouble comes finding them.,"It was handed over to the two new directors and the result is not so good. This is a most simplest film in the 'Ice Age' series. For the first time, the franchise is in real trouble. Though it managed well at the box office, which is a below par compared to the previous installments. It looks like a short film or it should have been a short film. From the adventures to the locations, everything shrunk in this sequel. Except Scrat, who goes for a lifetime journey into the outer space.As usual the story continued, but this time Manny and his family and friends do not go anywhere, the trouble comes to them. So they have to find a solution to escape from it. At the right rime, Buck returns from the underground and teams up with his old friends to tackle the situation. Besides, Peaches getting married and all the fun adventures from the earth, as well as from the space in the solar system aims at one direction.Nowadays the space adventure is a big thing in films, and this franchise always extents its boundary for its new sequels, so this time it was something bigger than ever. I think it won't get bigger than this in a concept wise. Particularly Scrat who has been the backbone for this series donned with a spacesuit. Like Minions and Penguins, I too want Scrat's stand alone film. But I think that would not happen, not anytime soon, since those two films did not deliver the expected result.If you are an 'Ice Age' series fan or not, it does not matter, you will be slightly get disappointed for sure. Now it has overtaken the 'Shrek' franchise with this fifth film and they are already thinking about the sixth. This is not that bad, just a watchable average film and you need to be updated if you want to continue the series in the future. So that's the reason I suggest to watch this. Other than that, it is totally ignorable one.5.5/10"
54,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,14 July 2016,Are you KIDDIN me?,"The movie starts with a promising note which showcases the formation of planets (This was already revealed in trailer! this is not a spoiler). From then on, it never got up into the entertaining mode. I'm never good at the physics concepts, the movie TRIED to use to make it a story. I didn't hear a laugh of a kid but all I was hearing is the laughs of men towards the double meaning dialogues of the movie. Dawn of Dinosaurs probably was the last good film in this franchise for me. I didn't like the Continental drift either. This 5th one is even more worse than that. There is no logic at all in any part of the scene (Not that I know of at least). I think its time to stop this series here. I am going with 5 out of 10 just for my love I had towards the franchise and the characters of SID and Manny who never stops entertaining us despite the horrible script. I DON'T RECOMMEND..."
55,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,2 September 2016,Were you rooting for the asteroid?,"I'm going to come clean right now and admit that I'm not a fan of the ""Ice Age"" movies. I found the original to just be okay. I actually did enjoy ""Ice Age: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs"". I found out that this has the lowest rating of any movie I've seen this year on RottenTomatoes and I can certainly agree. This movie is just way too predictable and makes little sense. Seriously, half of these jokes and setups I could see coming from a mile away. When I saw the big scary silhouette, I knew it was going to be Puck. When I saw Scrat turn off gravity, I knew he was going to turn on gravity in an extreme way. When I saw Sid talking to his girlfriend, I knew he wasn't talking to her.Everything just seems so clichéd in this. We even start off with the forgotten anniversary and move into talk about the daughter leaving home. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have TWO nipple jokes and some poop jokes and anus jokes. I knew that the crude humor would continue in this. The dinosaurs were so dumb in this. Wouldn't it make more sense to simply say they'd fly back to the center of the Earth and survive there? I didn't know who the leader of the crystal place would be and I simply didn't care. When I saw the female sloth I immediately knew ""love interest for Sid"". For all my complaints, I actually did think it was interesting to see how the problem would be resolved and Sid's potential love interest. It's still not worth seeing as there are far better movies this year. *1/2"
56,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,4 September 2016,No way,"I just watched it. By my opinion it's nothing together first movies. Every next one becomes worst. It only shows how effects are not everything. First is the rude humor, too many butts, it's a kids movie after all. And second, you ruined Sid. I loved Sid, he was sloppy but never with bad hygiene, you made him look disgusting. The whole story somehow runs too fast, like stupid American action, we could not feel the atmosphere. It was running, screaming, rude jokes, you totally ruined the movie! Yes, there were good details, but details without base is nothing. Too many new characters, too disgusting thing like spitting lama and all those other things... And why the... Diego looks so old? Manny and Elly were fine, he looks like an old man. Tiger, pardon me. Do I have to say again you ruined the movie?"
57,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,6 January 2018,Could have been better if tried,"This sequel is the worst.. Degrading day by day.. not only children watch animated movies but also adults. So please don't ignore us, use some brain to make next one interesting with a good storyline.."
58,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,5 November 2017,Pythagoras-He has the right angle,"Our same fun characters are out to save the world from a meteor. The film pays homage to ""2001..."" and Moses. The kids still love it. There were some decent jokes, but all-in-all the characters are starting to become more irritating than entertaining. Maybe we could end the Ice Age and kill them all off next time."
59,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,1 October 2017,They tried too hard to make it funny...,"With every single minute of the first 30 minutes being one prat fall after another, this one showed me it was not going to be very good...To make it even worse, the CGI was way too bright, and just didn't project the same color as the originals...it felt fake, period...while it had 3D depth, otherwise it wasn't impressive...I'm having a tough time continuing on with this review, it isn't bad per se'...but in no way does it have the same magic we have grown to expect from Ice Age..."
60,Ice Age: Collision Course,7,3 May 2017,Even space is not safe from Scrat...,"""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is easily the best of the entire franchise. And that is not only because the technology has gotten much better since the first ""Ice Age"" movie from 2002, but also because of the storyline and the comedy.I sat down with my seven year old son to watch ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" and I think we ended up being equally entertained and amused with this 2016 addition to the ""Ice Age"" franchise. Personally, I sat down to watch this because of Scrat, as he is just hilarious, despite him only being a supporting character.The story in ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" starts out with Scrat accidentally managing to trigger a cosmic event that comes to threaten Earth in his constant quest to acquire his precious acorn. With doom fast approaching it is up to the ragtag group of friends to come together with a plan how to save everything they love and hold dear.The animation style and art style is just lovable, as it has been in all of the ""Ice Age"" movies. But of course this becomes improved with each movie as the technology becomes better. And the level of detail and finesse the animators manage to come up with never cease to amaze me. It is visually stunning to sit through ""Ice Age: Collision Course"", no doubt about it.And it is also always a treat when they get the same voice actors and actresses to return to revisit their characters, as it gives a good continuation to the characters and you easily reconnect with the characters from that recognition of a familiar voice.As for the voice acting, then they really managed to get an all-star ensemble of voice acting performers together for this movie. And aside from Scrat, whom is relatively unvoiced, then my favorite is Denis Leary as he puts a voice to Diego.""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is filled with lots of laughs and really funny situations that are so nicely animated and brought to life on the screen. And it is especially great because they continue on with the type of comedy established in the first movie and seen throughout the entire franchise, but also manages to add something new to each movie.If you enjoyed the previous ""Ice Age"" movies, then you definitely do not want to miss out on ""Ice Age: Collision Course""."
61,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,1 July 2016,Next movie should be Ice Age: Extinction,"The ice age franchise has run its course. Now it is exhausted.Ice age 3 Dawn of the dinosaurs will always be the greatest of this series. That movie has a good story, interesting and lovable characters, great action, and humour. It takes the audience on an adventure of fun and discovery.However, the latest movie is mediocre at best. It has lost the magic that made the franchise great in the first place. It offers almost no thrills, even though it is a delight to see the return of Buck. The only scene that made me chuckle is Buck's ""Let the mammals pass!"" Everything else about this movie is so stale.The filmmakers do not even care about creating characters that the audience can care about. It is time to let this franchise die. Next movie should be about these mammals' extinction."
62,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,23 July 2016,Unwatchable,"Boring. The movie is boring. It's not just your everyday boring, it's so boring the family fallen asleep at the first QUARTER. Forced. Everything in it is forced. The jokes, the story-line, the family-drama,the characters. Senseless. Everything in it is just so far-fetched from everything, it is out of the ""it's a cartoon"" border and just drops this there and that, because why not. For the plot, and for advancing the plot, things are just there. Annoying. The characters and the drama is seriously annoying. I'm not going to spoil, but what the characters say and how they act, and things happen annoyingly and than there is a dumb unfunny joke to top that right away, or something falls at someone and that's the hit. I really think, this movie shouldn't have happened. It's bad. You are happy to get out of the chair and have a walk after it. You are just happy you don't have to watch it anymore.It's NOT family friendly. If you are parents, you wish you never had a kid, so you wouldn't have to watch THIS. It's that bad. Even worse, a lot of kid doesn't enjoy it, or just smiles. They don't really laugh, maybe a 2-3 yo when someone gets hit. The family drama makes it awkward to watch and forced. After a while a lot of sighs are heard. It's a cringe. The monologues are so awkward and not in a good way. In a ""I feel shameful for watching this."" kinda way."
63,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,10 July 2016,Magnetic rocks and UFOs,"The Ice Age team appears to be out of ideas, at least that's how this new one feels.The plot is dreadfully contrived and over complicated for its target audience, which surely must be the five to ten year old demographic.In brief, there's an asteroid heading towards the Earth and it's up to the mammoth, the sloth, the ferret and the sabre tooth tigers to stop it. Even for a kids story, that's pretty ridiculous. Even the Scrat sequences have started to become pretty uninteresting.Having said all that, the old familiar faces are there and, whilst they might too be getting a tad tired, not all is lost. It still retains an air of charm inherited from the previous movies. That's about it though.If you have options, I'd spend the money elsewhere if I were you. It falls just short of the worth-watching accolade."
64,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,16 October 2016,Horrible Horrible stuff,"Worst movie I have seen in a long long time! Ice Age gets worse in every movie. All animals sipping on drinks, marrying each other ... The crystal world they made up is just plain stupid.The whole movie is really ridiculous and has nothing of the beauty of the first movie at all!Also it is filled with wordly wisdoms, morale decisions, and so on...Watching it made us sick. ""You have to let your daughter go when she is ready."" ... All that nice and the excessive talk about feelings and family. Someone tried to go all Disney with the movie. Well if you see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about. Diegos biggest problem in the movie is if he'll ever be a good parent. I can't believe I watched the whole thing!But here is my tip, don't watch it! Ever! Don't waste your time and money! Watch the trailer, it contains all of the funny scenes too."
65,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,4 March 2017,brightly colored non-sense,"Scrat's hunt for the acorn leads him into a spaceship buried in the ice. He accidentally flies into space and sets asteroids on a collision course with earth. Back on the ground, Peaches and Julian want to get married. It's Manny and Ellie's anniversary when some of the asteroids start crashing onto the ground. Buck the weasel explains a prophecy set in stone about an asteroid destroying the world. The gang sets off to stop the forewarn catastrophe opposed by a family of dino-birds.The Ice Age franchise has always played fast and loose with facts and reality. This goes way too far and makes less sense than anything from before. It is sound and fury signifying nothing. The story rambles on and on. The squirrel is still the funniest part of the movie. If they want to go into space, why not have aliens take the whole gang and have some fun with that. This is a lot of unfunny non-sense. It's only saving grace may be its brightly-colored wackiness which may delight the youngest crowd. The story is too much of a mess for anybody with a developed brain."
66,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,26 November 2016,Same thing we've seen before,"When the first Ice Age film was released in 2002, I was a massive fan. The world created within this animation was comparable to that of The Lion King or Toy Story.This is the fifth film in the Ice Age series and perhaps the worst yet. It feels as if with each film the humour dumbs down and the target audience gets younger and younger. As the stories have become more and more child friendly, they have too suffered in their originality.The casting of Jessie J an underlined example of how frivolous these films are put together. The new characters far less thought out then in the first film.Perhaps what is worse then the characterisation is the feeble attempt's at humour, the same physical comedy we've seen in the first four films. Ultimately this film offers nothing original and I wish someone would just put this film series out of it's misery before they tarnish it any further."
67,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,24 July 2016,I feel so cheated!!!,"I really REALLY wanted to like this movie. I love the Ice Age movies, but they haven't gotten better with time - only worse. And this is the worst of the worst. Save your money, save your time, and go hit yourself in the head with a hammer - trust me, it'll be more fun than watching this movie! The animation was nice but I have nothing else good to say about it. The story-line was lame, the actors just walked through their inane lines, and it all felt so tired, with trite jokes and forced dialogue. There was also no cohesiveness and part way into the movie a whole new bunch of characters sprang up and I kept wondering where they came from. The jokes were so lame that my husband and I actually turned to each other at the same time thinking ""did they really just SAY that""? This movie was so horrid it had me squirming in my seat. I felt sad - so very sad that the movie makers couldn't tell the difference between a good sequel and a cheap rip-off. I also felt cheated, really cheated, that the writers/directors made caricatures out of such great characters. I think I laughed once or twice at Scrat - but how many times can you hear his silly sound effects or watch his eyes bulge and his tail fluff before even that becomes unfunny? This movie is an insult to anyone who likes the Ice Age movies and should have never been made. We did not subject ourselves to the full torture - we walked out about half way through this poor excuse for entertainment."
68,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,26 August 2016,"Convoluted, cheesy, but there is just enough there for fans.","This movie is a cash grab, of that there is little doubt. Blue Sky Studios knows that they have a recognizable franchise, and in and effort to build off of a base that is accustomed to familiar characters, they have produced the weakest Ice Age film yet.The plot, while involving a litany of details and characters is quite simple. A meteor is plummeting towards earth and the characters must find a way to divert its trajectory. There is just enough for fans of the series to enjoy. Sid will still invoke a laugh because of his haplessness, there are some comical slapstick scenes, a good one- liner or two, and Scrat's insanity is energetic and comical. Furthermore, the reintroduction of Simon Pegg's un- hinged, yet hilarious, Buck is fun (the Dawn of the Dinosaurs was the second best Ice Age in my opinion).However, the plot, involving another trek, and the messages, while positive, are lacking the same heart and character of the past. The dichotomy between the original and this film is staggering. The animation is great, but the amount of characters this franchise now has, the array of plot devices, and the extremes that drive the narrative have weakened it to the point that this must be the last movie or else all self-respect for this franchise is utterly gone.Kids will love it, older kids and even adults that have enjoyed the adventures of these characters will find some scenes that are reminiscent of earlier movies. Yet, this film is mediocre at best and if someone never cared for Ice Age this movie will by no means make their opinion change."
69,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,7 August 2016,Dear Lord will the Ice Age franchise never melt down?,"I honestly can't remember the last time I felt this disappointingly angry from an animated movie, and I am afraid to say that this is not only the worst movie of the franchise but possibly one of the worst animated movies ever made. Now please don't me wrong I love animation and I'm not the kind of person who gives a flying toss about that old (not to mention stupid) prejudice where animated movies are only meant for children. If I may speak out I'd say that for the past years we've had quite many good animated movies that even adults and many different ages has praised for, but I can understand that some people will likely be flabbergasted when they see a movie like Ice Age Collision Course.I didn't have much expectations to see how this would have turned out, but seeing the trailers I already knew that this wasn't going to get anywhere to be a masterpiece or even a modern classic. Ice Age 5 is in my opinion basically the same kind of movie like its predecessors, in other words nothing new or anything interesting happens in this movie and that's pretty baffling to me. After 4 movies why couldn't they learn the mistakes from the previous movies? Now the first one wasn't so bad but not necessarily my favorite movie ever but still pretty good, while a certain thing I did not like from the first movie was how some of the characters were pretty unlikeable but later learned to be accepting each other. But in this movie the main characters are still being unlikeable jerks to each other, like for example everyone likes to ignore Sid, Manny being an overprotective father like the previous movie and many disgraceful humor which is something I really getting tired to witness in every Ice Age movie.As for Scrat, I'm starting to think that his scenes are not only getting more tiresome but are representing filler just for the sake to entertain the young children. I'm not against slapstick humor but I'd rather be watching the original Looney Tunes shorts instead of this forced and unimpressed humor.Another problem I had with this movie is that it doesn't seem to care about continuity anymore, like for example whatever happened to Peaches's little nice best friend Louis the Molehog? Remember him? Of course not because they had to ditch him for no reason (albeit he did have a cameo) and the sad thing is that he was the only likable and smart person in the fourth movie. And where the heck are the humans? Remember them from the first movie? It feels really weird to know that they no longer exist in this franchise when clearly they were one of the important keys on that movie.Like I said before, nothing new happens in this movie well maybe one thing (more about that later). But since this movie is so darn repetitive I believe one could simply sum up this and future Ice Age movies (God forbid they will happen) in short ways to know what to expect: First pointless Scart humor, some friends/family issues, then something bad happens and everyone freaks out, they try to find a new place to live or save someone, more annoying Scart humor, coming in trouble but saves afterwards, a minor conflict with forgettable one-time villains, everyone is saved and can live happy, then some more Scrat humor where he seems to finally get his acorn but messes up and screams obnoxiously.The only new thing that happened in this movie would probably be the character Brook, not only was she a pretty rushed and not very interesting character but her return at the end of the movie (I'd hate to sound like a heartless person but it was very cheesy) was basically a dumb Deux Ex Machina. I mean come on not even a Disney movie would stoop such low to make people happy at the end (ok maybe one movie but at least it wasn't cheesy but much well crafted). The only redeeming quality would be the animation which is admittedly pretty top-notch but that doesn't save the awfulness of the movie.Plus I know one thing people who thought this would be a bad movie told that the franchise is just getting weirder and weirder such as things that hasn't even been invented yet, well I'm afraid they right. They even put modern songs that never happened before in the franchise (ok maybe some few ones but the real ones wouldn't show up unexpectedly just like that) which was just ridiculous. The Ice Age franchise has really been jumping the shark on this one, which is why I won't be giving a chance to see if they make a 6th Ice Age movie. Just when Blue Sky Studios had to give us a well done movie like Peanuts it had to be another Ice Age movie. Although it may not be the most worst movie I've seen in my life but it is still worse than ridiculous. I recommend you to see Zootopia/Zootropolis or Kung Fu Panda 3 instead, and I bet Finding Dory (which I haven't seen yet but want to) will be a much better movie than this.1/10."
70,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,12 September 2016,A complete waste of time,"This film is BORING And people with at least 4 brain cells knows that this movie it's not entertainment, it's not funny, it's not useful, it's a complete waste of time and it doesn't deserves your money There so many wrong things in this movie, the characters are idiots, the story is dull, the comedy is stupid and flat and there's a lot of unnecessary pop cultural references, hashtag jokes and cheap humor. There's no effort, no tension or something that makes you think in an entire one and a half hour. People that say ""oh, it's just a kids movie"" are 100% WRONG. ITS AN IDIOTIC FILM THAT ITS NOT WORTH TO WATCH NEVER SEE IT, NOTHE EVEN IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE FRANCHISE"
71,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,17 July 2016,Feels both tired and bloated- some fantastic animation though,"Having really enjoyed the first two 'Ice Age' films, the other three films in the franchise weren't as good. 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs' was still entertaining though, but while 'Continental Drift' had its great things (like Captain Gutt) it did feel like a sequel too far.If one thought that 'Continental Drift' was a sequel too far, while there are still good things here 'Collision Course' does feel like the writers were trying to keep things afloat by putting in as much mileage and material as possible but it all feels like a try-too-hard effort. 'Collision Course' is not a terrible film but this reviewer found it a huge disappointment.The best thing about 'Collision Course' is the animation, which is fantastic and the one thing that has improved greatly over-time. For me, especially in the space scenes with Scrat and with Buck it is the best-looking film in the franchise, there is so much eye-popping detail, the characters move easily and look more refined and one really cannot get enough of the vibrant, rich colours. The soundtrack is catchy, upbeat and whimsical, with an inspired riff on Figaro with Buck's playful re-introduction.While the laughs do not come consistently, there are definitely moments and they come from Scrat (especially the opening scene, which is the funniest scene in the film), who's had more inspired material but the facial expressions, physical comedy and the visuals in general help stop making Scrat too much of a tiresome one-joke character, and with Buck when re-introduced. The voice acting is still very good, the most enthusiastic coming from Simon Pegg. Scrat and Buck, making a welcome return, are scene-stealing characters, Diego is fun enough if not as showy or with as much to do and Ellie provides some sincerity and heart, her scene with Manny providing a rare note of realism to the film.However, 'Collision Course' suffers from being over-stuffed, over-complicated and bloated. Not just the story, which is pretty all-over-the-place, with too much that is rushed and like too much is going on with potentially great plot strands not being developed enough or given short shrift. The whole Manny trying to come to terms with his daughter planning to move away is completely lost amidst everything else and that could have brought some heart to the film, Sid's romance is rushed and painfully contrived and really there was really no need for the antagonists.But also the characters, it does feel like there are too many in the film, with too many of them also having barely any screen time, and the only really interesting ones are Buck, Scrat and Ellie. Diego isn't in it enough though does just fine when he's there and is still a lot of fun, and Manny is pretty dull. Sid is very annoying this time round, and as said the antagonists felt thrown in for the sake of ""needing"" obligatory"" antagonists and were underwritten, non-threatening, barely interesting and basically completely unnecessary with their motivations dealt with in a very generic and self-aware way. The script has some witty moments, but is too hit-and-miss and stop-start, the laughs coming too far and between and the best moments don't come to the level of the franchise's very best moments.All in all, disappointing and definitely feels even more of a sequel too far than 'Continental Drift'. The animation is fantastic and there are definitely some good moments, but the tiredness of the material and the story bloating hurts it quite severely. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
72,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,3 October 2016,unfortunately not closed the saga in a way that we expected.,"Ice Age: Collision Course is not the faintest doubt the franchise, the Ice Age saga not deserved a final so the film is not bad, is regular, might well have been better, the story is cool, a giant meteor is coming in the direction of the earth, and Manny, Sid, Diego, Ellie, Shira, Grandma, Julian (new character Buck (is back), Eddie, Crash and Peaches will have to do something to save the earth, when I heard the back Buck, I was happy, more unfortunately he's too boring in this movie, is unnecessary moments, the soundtrack became weaker, the mood is weaker, even with funny moments, I do not recommend this movie, just saga fan even more believe that taking a younger cousin or son, he can have fun, more Ice Age: Collision Course is not the end of the franchise deserved Note 5.8."
73,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,2 August 2016,The ice age saga is officially over,"This has got to be the worst ice age movie of all, this series has been milking money out as far as possible, but now its just not funny or cute anymore..........just dumbed down husband-wife drama and really awful story-line, my guess after watching the movie is that the aimed audiences were 4-8years old, and some 8yo's too will also find this pretty boring to watch.There is nothing to really explain about the story-line because it just isn't funny and makes no sense whatsoever.Also the cringy dialogues this time come from everyone not just the sloth, it gets really really cringy with the dialogues midway through the movie, felt like the animals were Disney princesses wearing a disguise......if u have a 4-8 year old, take him/her to the theatre and headphones for yourself, so u can listen to some music or watch an episode of some good shows ur following, coz this will make u feel really uncomfortable otherwise and u might get this urge to leave the theatre."
74,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,7 October 2016,Parents do not let your kids watch this!!!,"We really enjoyed the other Ice Ages but after 10 minutes of this movie, I was forced to take my kids out of the cinema. First, the father elephant lets his daughter win hockey. The mother elephants comes in and emasculate him by saying she always wins. To make matters worst, she pushes him twice (domestic violence message) and he takes it while emasculating and complaining she never gets flowers. The daughter shows very little respect to his father where her boyfriend acts ""gay"" and hugs the father. Another creature comes in and says regarding relationships, ""love them and leave them and take half of everything."" I was in complete shock!!!! What kind of message are they trying to give our children... I notice this trend in most of Hollywood movies where i'm starting to ban my kids from watching most movies now. I have to watch the movie first cause I don't want my children to be damaged like so many children turn out to be in the west due to TV. It's getting to the point where i'm want to pull my kids out of school cause the teachers think this kind of behaviour is acceptable who are teaching my children valves when I go to work everyday. I pray to god that Trump wins cause he doesn't stand for this kind of bad morals in our country! Hollywood is clearly corrupted like the media by a VERY dark force!! SHAME ON YOU ICE AGE!!! I will never watch my kids see anymore of your trilogies!"
75,Ice Age: Collision Course,2,25 July 2016,"Terrible, Hate on me all you want supporters of this movie, I really do not care.","Quite possibly the stupidest reviews on this site are on this movie. Plot summaries, terrible grammar and spelling, somehow getting lots and lots of people finding it helpful. Are people really that brain-dead? Is everyone here really just a 7 year old in disguise? I'm old enough to see through this stupidity, but somehow others aren't? People. This is the 5th Ice Age movie. You can tell that the people at Blue Sky have run out of ideas, but are being forced to make these because SOMEHOW these movies make a lot of money from outside the U.S. (which is where I'm from.) Come to think of it, maybe that's where all this positive stuff is coming from here, people from outside the states trying to justify a bad movie because over there it is revered as the Second Coming of Jesus. Well flashy little news flash for you people... it's not.The story is terrible, the writing is abysmal, and while the animation is nice, it feels wasted once you realize this is the 5TH ICE AGE MOVIE. All the great environments and colors stop looking good and start making you feel like they should have been used on something else.Let's talk about the characters. They all suck. My theory is that the only reason this movie exists is to give Sid a girlfriend, but even then Sid is unlikable as ever and I've actually completely forgotten the girlfriend's name. Other than those two, Manny is now a terrible excuse for a main character, and his family is even more useless than in Continental Drift. I didn't even think that was possible! Diego is now pointless, and his girlfriend he picked up in the last movie that was apparently important enough to warrant a return in this one... says maybe 3 lines? And maybe one of them contributes to the ""plot"". I already mentioned Sid, but to reiterate, the only reason this movie was made was to give him a girlfriend, despite Sid being a bad character even in the first movies. The new characters are just plot conveniences (or the aforementioned girlfriend of Sid). That one guy from the 3rd movie makes a return despite being absent the last movie and serving no purpose in the 3rd movie. The reason this paragraph is going on for as long as it is is because they added more and more characters as time went on, making it stupider and stupider. And Scratt, once the reason people people liked this series because of how funny he was, is no longer funny, and his charm has officially worn off.Before I get a ton of ""I didn't find this helpful"", 2 things. 1, did you not read the review? Are you really that stupid? Is there a running joke going on that I'm not aware of? Is that it? And 2, come on. This was helpful in every way possible, and you clearly don't know why. It talked about the plot, the characters, and the animation. But to you, ""it wasn't helpful."" Come on. Really?On one final note, I really hate it when people use the ""It's just a kids movie"", or the ""The family loved it"" excuse. The first one I've talked about before, so I'll make it brief: What, you mean kids of IQ 5 under? For kids of ages embryo to 1? That's what I thought. The second one... parents will get sick of the ""humor"" really fast. The kids won't know why, because they're at an age where fart jokes are still funny to them. Parents will despise it, kids will love it, but the parents make positive reviews on the kids behalf, completely destroying the concept of reviews. So stop."
76,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,24 July 2016,Yellow Ice...horrible tasting movie,"I miss you Manny ,Sid & Diego what happened? It's like you were blown off the face of the Earth...sadly the Three Amigos are now the Three Stooges . The awful trend continues, throwing everything & the kitchen sink into the pixel blender to cover all smirking demographics . There's no art or heart to this generic consumer trash just more ""Wow"" computer animation by underpaid, moonlighting gamer animators sweating away in another forgotten Shanghai basement . This techno Shrek art is getting old, overused & underdeveloped so one movie blurs into the next. Was I watching Ice Age or the Secret life of Pets? (another dog) They stripped out all heart and soul so now the Elephant ,Tiger & Lovable Loser (Whatever... I know it was the Ice Age but it could've been any soulless animal or human dumpster diving in the Disney Theme Park) So much talk talk talk & sight gags it hits you like a freight train leaving nothing but the wreckage of your favorite characters from 1-3 . They make every character into a human equivalent using the same stale stock characterization & voices like Queen Latifah & Jennifer Lopez ( or maybe they do figuring the American movie audience is dumb as meteor rocks ) about making a cartoon classic , this crap is the Happy Meal for the masses to be watched & quickly forgotten until the next bowel movement....minus $40 for a family of four"
77,Ice Age: Collision Course,2,13 July 2016,Despite it's cold setting it's a hot mess,"With 'Ice Age: Collision Course' we have arrived at the fifth installment 'Ice Age'franchise. Once again we join Manny, Diego and Sid on a journey this time their objective is to save the world from an incoming meteor that will decimate all life on earth. However despite it's cold setting 'Ice Age: Collision Course' is a hot mess.Once again Blue Sky Studios have created a visually good looking world. While it pales in comparison to Pixar's latest movie Finding Dory it still provides a rich world that allows a fun story to be told, however it is exactly here where the movie fails to deliver. The main characters we know and love from the earlier movies hardly get any screen time. Instead the movie shifts the focus to the many side characters and forces the main characters from the earlier movies into supporting roles. Sadly most of these characters just are not as like- able and because of this the impending danger of the meteorite seems small since the viewer won't care what happens to them. When the annoying possums Eddie and Crash are in every scene while main character Diego only says a handful of lines you know the movie has a problem.Other than the main story-line the movie is filled with unnecessary side stories such as the one where the mammoth Julian is trying to get his future father-in-law Manny to like him. Now if the movie was at least somewhat funny it would've gone down as a mediocre animation movie, but the problem with almost all of the jokes in the movie is that they feel extremely forced and are very predictable. Most of the times they are nothing more than simple fart-jokes.Now young children will probably have enough fun watching this movie, but for adults there really is nothing there and I feel really bad for the parents that will have to sit trough this one because their kid wants to see it.My rating: 2/10"
78,Ice Age: Collision Course,1,26 August 2016,Writers should really lay off LSD for a spell.,"Just made it through the entirety of the sh!t show that people called Ice Age: Collision course. Lovable Scrat makes a great opening to the movie, but things go downhill quickly right after. The same, classically boring equation creators have used for years would STILL work had they laid off the heavy drugs they must've done while writing the story line and designing secondary characters. I'm officially done with this franchise. Whoever created this garbage needs to be punched. repeatedly. IMDb also needs to screw off with a 10 line requirements. There are some titles (such as this piece of trash) that really doesn't deserve the 10 liner."
79,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,1 August 2016,What Did I Just Watch??,A squirrel like creature finds an acorn and in so doing uncovers a UFO which it then takes into space. In space it encounters the planets lined up like pool balls and knocks them into place? But the creature left earth so Earth is already in place?? Are you as confused as I am yet? Then back on Earth we have wedding preparations going on until an asteroid is hurtled to Earth by the UFO flying squirrel thing. Okay. I can go with that. But then we have a group of animals who aren't aging and some of whom are over 300 years old? Then they turn old again but at 300+ wouldn't the oldest of them just turn to dust? Then we go back and forth to the UFO where the gravity is turned up and things happen I don't want to spoil but then we head back to Earth but then Neil Degrasse Tyson turns up to talk to us briefly...and on and on the weirdness goes. I will say that my 4-year-old nephew enjoyed it which is what the movie is meant to do but it felt like I was watching two completely different movies. This movie would be fine as a rental or even to own if you want something to occupy kids but don't look for more from this.
80,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,7 August 2016,wow simply awful,"What happened, i liked the other ice ages and actually looked forward to this one.. The story was the worst of all the ice age movies..if it were not for sid this movie would be a complete disaster totally dumbed down for kids. Most of the jokes were lame,diego had almost no lines so the three main characters were not as funny..This gets my vote for worst show of the summer..glad this is supposed to be the last one..because this is totally forgettable... it's written for 5 year olds.. iForgot you need more lines of writing so i'll sum it up this way if you must take your kids to this make sure you have some music to listen to or something because you'll get bored i got tired of it pretty fast.It's a better rental then something to waste money on at a theatre go to finding dory or secret life of pets which i thought was pretty good..so that's all..."
81,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,2 November 2016,"Really dumb, but well animated with a few good sequences","This continues the Ice Age arch of descent into mediocrity, the main characters are now fully established as a bad 80s sitcom, and continues that way. This can get on your nerves, and if it does, don't bother watching this movie, you already know you will hate it based on the earlier sequels.It still have funny animated sequences, though they do get dumber and dumber for each film. The best I can say about them, is that the movie is fully self-aware, and actually points out in the beginning that it is going to be really dumb (their own word).So if you like silly gags and still has feel a connection to main characters you will probably enjoy this movie. Otherwise, it is at best a time waster."
82,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,20 July 2016,"The Ice Age Franchise got Shreked, Hard!!!!","Ice Age: Collision Course has extremely run it's course. What was once a respectable franchise with heartfelt moments and true originality has fallen victim to sequalitis time and time again. Like the Shrek franchise, Ice Age is heading in the same direction, to the back of the DVD cupboard. The Run Down: Manny, Diego and Sid (to an extent) are content with life. Manny has Ellie and Peaches, Diego has Shira and Sid has...well.... 'his boyish good looks' as he puts it. But all seems for naught unless they band together and stop an impending asteroid shower from destroying the earth. The All the bumper characters are back with the only positive coming from Simon Pegg's Buck who was sadly missing from the last outing. The rest are just here for stale laughs that are overtired and pointless. Crash and Eddie are as stupid as ever and Grannie was not funny the first time round so why but her back on the saddle for a second attempt. New addition like Brooke and Julian don't add anything that has not been seen and done in animation and film before. A common flaw in Blue Sky's attempt in capturing the first films shine is that it continuously seeks a story that requires the protagonists to go on 'a road trip'. All entries into this franchise has done this and it is just getting predictable and hard to find it fresh. The films message is not clever, original nor deep enough to truly resonate in the hearts of film goers like a Pixar film. These films can only use the power of love and friendship before these movie bleed into each other and feel like bad case of dejavu. One glimmer of hope that Blue Sky continue to nail on the head is it's animation, it's truly AAA quality and on par with Disney and Dreamworks efforts. But continual narrative problems and unfunny slapstick humour keep the Ice Age franchise from really deserving its status as the Highest Grossing Animated Franchise (based on the one property) of all time. The Ice Age franchise is constantly overshadowed by the likes of Toy Story and Kung Fu Panda as these franchise hit the ever crucial narrative mark. In conclusion: The 5th Instalment in the Ice Age franchise showcases a clear disconnect with modern animated features. What was once popular 15 years ago is now nothing more then a 90 minute childish film filled with exhausting slapstick humour, minus the humour. Ranking of the Ice Age Franchise out of ten1. Ice Age = 8 2. Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs = 7 3. Ice Age: The Meltdown = 6 4. Ice Age: Continental Drift = 4 5. Ice Age: Collision Course = 3"
83,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,16 July 2016,Please let this be the last one.,"Here's my review of #IceAge #CollisionCourse. Let this be the last one. How many more can we take of the same old excuse of presenting Manny in different stages of his life and just slap it with some kind of journey to either find underground dinosaurs or defeat some kind of cataclysmic event like asteroids destroying the earth. What's the next Ice Age movie about? The stage in Manny's life in his twilight years with his grandkids as they're all journey on once more to stop El Nino that's again caused by Scrat? Please don't tell Blue Sky Studios I said that, don't give them ideas.Scrat's in space and up to no acorn good again, his shenanigan this time causes cosmic events that threatens the ice age world. Meanwhile, Manny has to deal with his daughter's upcoming marriage to Julian, a mammoth that means well but he gets under Manny's skin, plus the thought of giving his daughter away is unbearable to any dad, much less Manny. All of a sudden space rocks start falling from the sky and the biggest one yet is about to hit earth. Sid, Manny Diego, Buck and the rest of the herd must leave their home and embark on yet another quest to stop the end of the world.By this time it's obvious that the actors involved with this project either don't have anything better to do or they're just doing it for the paycheck because as a film, ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is a snoozer, I kid you not, I was at the press screening and I fell asleep twice. And there were times when I spent much of the time looking at my watch wondering when the film's end credit would roll just so I can tell which A-listers were part of the voice cast, turns out, there were plenty of them.""Ice Age: Collision Course"" has two or three exciting moments thanks to my favorite character, Buck, voiced by Simon Pegg, but for the most part, this film is more like ""Ice Age: Has Run Its Course."" Whatever it was that made the first ""Ice Age"" an Oscar nominee for best animated category, is now gone. This once adorable heartfelt friendship story has come to its end. All this latest installment essentially does is just exist. Nothing more, nothing less. But with any animated family film, you have to ask the question.. will the kids enjoy this one? Sure, I think so, I think they'll have a good laugh at it and why wouldn't they! So perhaps Fox should've released ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" straight to home video and let the daycare centers play it for their afternoon segments.-- Rama's Screen --"
84,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,29 September 2016,On the subject of aggression,"""Dealing with aggression is enormously difficult, not just for parents, but for us in the mental health field,"" - Henri Parens, M.D Some people like Ice Age Movies. Personally, I watch these movies with a cringe. Only thing worthy are the creative segments with Scrat (the hyperactive squirrel) that interlude between segments of the movie.Scrat segments are fantastic word-less slapstick full of emotions with interesting stories and wonderful twists... scrat cries and whimpers in a multitude of ways striving to get a hazelnut and ends up creating world changing events.The rest of this movie, however, is a sad combination of banal and disturbing. Some completely unconnected and sometimes completely child inappropriate ""humor"". E.g. jokes about someone old that it is sad they are not dead, someone being ugly enough so they shouldn't have any friends, someone being headstrong so it means that you should condescend them when explaining things.... so much of the interactions between the characters are full of anger and passive aggressive intonation and phrasing. Instead of a lovely children's movie, you get something that teaches kids the worst possible ways to interact with each other. These are both in the normal dialogue as well as in the jokes.There's some basic story about a father not accepting his son in law and the experience they share together trying to get somewhere and save the earth... but honestly, you wouldn't want either character in your children's life. Even worse are the other side-kick characters. In fact, everyone were so one-dimensional, one could argue all the characters in this movie were side-kicks.I give this film 2/10 since the reasonably executed animation is mottled by disturbing acting and jokes that you can only watch with a cringe while knowing your kids learn bad behaviour. I add another 2 for the scrat segments."
85,Ice Age: Collision Course,2,5 October 2016,They should have stopped when the 4th movie came out,"The first movie was good. VERY good, it had a good soundtrack and maybe the animation was a bit unfinished, but that didn't matter. Parts like the dodos and the ice slide were entertaining and it had a good story with even some serious pars. The 2nd movie was outstanding. The animation improved so much since the 1st movie. It just gave you that real winter feeling. And the soundtrack was the best part of this movie. It was a good experience. And even some parts with the marine reptiles or meltdown could be scary for a kid, so it didn't get to childish. The songs like Food Glorious Food were also hilarious. But the 3rd movie felt like a Jurassic Park ripoff, and even a good character like Buck couldn't make up for that. And a Baryonyx could NEVER grow as humongous as Rudy. The 4th movie was not that good. It got entirely distracted from the whole Ice Age purpose. In fact there is NO snow in this film. A view icebergs and nothing more. And only Scrat and Flint were the best characters for their innocent stupidity. It made no sense but.... i guess it's entertaining for kids, and that's all what matters right? And this movie... i'm not even gonna waste words on it, life is too precious. It uses the same plot from the 2nd movie, surviving the elements, and it adds to much characters that don't have a purpose. It just seems like one big money grab, nothing more. Go watch the 1st or 2nd movie if you want that winter feeling again!"
86,Ice Age: Collision Course,,3 August 2016,Entertaining but forgettable,"This film tells the story of a group of animals who need to work together to avoid a giant meteorite colliding with the Earth, which would cause the extinction of all animals.Just like the other ""Ice Age"" films, Scrat provides the most fun, but is also in the film the shortest. The plot is simple, but captivating and fun for children. The viewers in the cinema laughed a lot, and people also reacted loads to the rather scary moment when Scrat accidentally activated the hyper gravity in the spaceship which causes a series of accidents. The film is fun and lighthearted throughout. The beautiful world at the end of the film does look very beautiful too! Overall, I enjoyed watching it, but I will forget about it in a few weeks."
87,Ice Age: Collision Course,2,28 July 2016,Horrible stereotypes - in animals?!,"Oh, what can I say? Make a comet go away, save the day, nobody dies, happy ending (and maybe some slapstick jokes to cover up the very simple plot). I would understand if that would just be it with this Ice Age, but on top of the very boring story they throw in loads of characters to fill up even more screen time. A yoga llama (come on - don't try to be the nudist club in Zootopia) and a scared-vegan- dinosaur. Do I need to mention the other ones? Completely irrelevant, and all these characters and the bad plot makes it so boring. The jokes are based on stereotypical gender roles, and it almost feels vulgar for our current time. The male-mammoths saves the day while the others try to stay organised. A female can't be loved without a young look. The female remembers their wedding anniversary, the male is like ""oooh no"" and the female gets sad and angry. Wow.image It is easy to see that Ice Age: Collision Course tried very, very hard. Putting in vegan jokes, yoga jokes, poop-and-fart-jokes, but when every other scene is that, well - you simply get tired. When I get bored in cinemas, I always end up analysing the gender roles in movies. It was not a single joke made by a female character (except the grandma) and then think that every other scene is a bad joke. No space for females being hilarious, or hyper. Maybe the creators just know what hypersensitive is.It's a very beautiful film though. Everything feels intensely real, and the 3D is brilliant and mostly giving depth. I'd also like to point out that the body language of the animals definitely belonged in the same universe as the movie Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009)."
88,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,26 July 2016,Tiresome Rehash,"Is this Ice Age 5? This needless sequel has yet more of the same, only this time it is really very dull, the Squirrel in space gags are diverting enough, and the weasel at least keeps the boredom away but this is a very thin and stretched film indeed. As before the animation is very impressively done, but with so many great animated film's out there these day's do we really care any more about stunning visuals? Movie producer's must become more original, all across the industry these corporate franchise film's are killing the business like the mammals in this film the movie industry is walking into extinction unless new idea's are promoted the punter's i fear will stay in front of there x boxes or whatever passes for home entertainment these day's. Ice Age 9 any one?"

90,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,24 July 2016,Unbearable!,"How could they mess up this beautiful series?! It was my favorite animation, but it's not anymore. I'm really disappointed. The story was awful. Actually it's the worst story of Ice Age series! The dialogue are inappropriate and absurd. It's like Disney Channel series. I think that they made this animation for only teenagers. I don't understand what they were trying to do. I guess they're following teens who watched first movie, but it's not universal like first movie. There are some important topics about family. However these weren't handled well in the story. Processing of scenes is too shallow. I watched in Turkish, so the only good thing about this movie are our voice actors."
91,Ice Age: Collision Course,,22 August 2016,I am done with Ice Age,"I really can't vote on this film because I haven't seen it yet. I intend on not seeing it as well. Ice Age used to be funny but has gone downhill after Ice Age: Continental Drift.How many movies are they going to milk out? The rumor is that if Collision Course is a success they will make another one. So let me see, success equals money which means more dough to make another film. Makes sense but eventually this franchise will bottom out soon enough. Remember when they stretched Shrek to four films? They stopped because they knew they were running out of ideas.One thing that really bothers me about these movies is the fact that someone is nobody until they have somebody. That is one of the unhealthiest things to preach to a young child watching this crap. Poor Sid doesn't have anybody to love him and all his friends do. I guess that makes him a loser. But wait, what this? He does find love after all in this film. A lot of people claim this is why this movie was made. I'm starting to think they are right. And of course we can't forget about Scrat who's been done to death with his acorn. Why don't they just give him a movie of his own?Another thing the Ice Age monopoly has been doing is pulling out every dirty joke in the book. They aren't funny anymore. Sex jokes and toilet humor is not funny when it's shoved down your throat in every animated film that is made. This is why I like movies like Zootopia and Big Hero 6 which didn't need that stuff to be a great film.Goodbye Ice Age films. The only decent ones I've seen are the first one and third one."
92,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,23 August 2016,Turning into emptiness,"Next year, the ""Ice Age"" franchise will have its 15th anniversary and this year we get the fifth full feature installment to the successful series. Many issues have been dealt with, many new characters have entered the picture, so it was finally time to talk about a subject that was actually defining many many centuries ago: the extinction of animals. They took the path of the meteoroid explanation for this movie. On the one hand, you could say it is fitting because it is such an important subject, on the other you could say it is fairly uncreative that they have to go for the obvious, maybe due to the lack of new ideas. This is especially disappointing as no less than four writers and two directors worked on this movie. You could really expect a better script by such a number of people, but it seems that what they came up with for these 95 minutes here is an example of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The voice actors are the same names that you know from the previous films and new additions include Jesse Tyler Ferguson (""Modern Family"") and Nick Offerman (""Parks and Recreation"") for example.If you don't think the franchise has jumped the shark with previous film already, then you may think so after watching this fifth. I did not enjoy it. Of course, the meteoroid story could have been so much better because it was such a defining event, but even aside from that core plot idea, it is extremely underwhelming. The mammoth story line is one that, with the father-daughter relationship, is one that never becomes as touching or relevant as it attempts to be. The Sid scenes are never really that funny with his search for a wife. The saber tooth scenes feel completely irrelevant and their arguments about getting a child feels thrown in so randomly only to fill some more screen time. The only character who made smiley occasionally was Sid's grandmother and the worst is the ending indicates that she will not be back for a 6th movie, which means that one could be even more boring and less interesting. Buck is better than most of the rest in here, but also not good enough to make up for all the flaws. I never found Scrat funny, but this is just personal perception. Maybe his fans can appreciate his scenes.One of the biggest problems here was that I felt the characters never really interacted with each other. For example the male saber tooth only talks to the female and there are basically no scenes when these two interact with the mammoths which goes really against the idea of how they showed us their strong friendship in previous films. Or for example the four mammoths, after the introduction, share no conversations with other characters really. Everybody was for themselves and all this despite them being on a huge journey together. Every character had their own story and it shut out most of the others completely. Apart from that, I struggled with the antagonists, creatures that were birds with a touch of dragon who wanted to keep our heroes from preventing the apocalypse (due to the strangest theory, are children really that stupid enough to believe it?). They were fairly uninteresting and the monkey from film 4 made up for some flaws with the story four years ago, but here even the antagonists kinda suck. The plot-holes that scientists may see in the idea how Buck and the gang want to save everybody are not a problem at all. Unrealistic occurrences are not a problem in animated movies. I do not expect a scientific documentary. But I do expect to get entertained and put a smile on my lips on more than 2 or 3 occasions. This film did not succeed to that regard. I cannot recommend the watch and I hope if they ever make another, then that one will be improved once again. It seems like a real challenge though."
93,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,8 August 2016,Better than the advertising made it out to be but stop it at this one before the ice completely melts,"A group of mammals must try and save the world and stop it from being destroyed by a huge meteor hurtling towards the earth.The third Ice Age film (Dawn Of The Dinosaurs) was actually fairly good and the fourth one (Continental Drift) was ,what I thought to be, an alright film when first released, but after a couple more viewings it isn't as good but is still bearable so I went into this film ,after seeing a few unfunny trailers, with quite a bit of trepidation but as usual I went in with an open mind. And I must admit I did laugh a few times in the first 15-20 minutes and it was fairly enjoyable. Then the plot went on and there were still one or two laughs just not as many. One of the standout problems that stops some opportunities for funny gags is that the film seems ,at times, to be too much like a cheesy American family based sit-com with certain side plot elements that have been seen hundreds of times in this sort of series and in many films over the years when the writers have run out of ideas. It does seem that at times the writers were trying to make this feature length or as near to the 90 minute mark as they possibly could just because of how much there is going on and how much seems to just be there to lengthen the time out and doesn't really have any relevance to the plot until the smallest possible detail where everything pieces together and only just makes sense and has some relevance and point apart from being there to make the film feature length. This leads me to many peoples recurring thoughts on the Ice Age series, Is it going to stop soon? Hopefully after this one and where it finishes they will leave it here. At a decent point that was watchable and provided some form of mild entertainment for just over 90 minutes.Yes it's fairly funny throughout and mildly entertaining but it does seem to lack quite a bit in the middle and a lot of the subplots have been seen before. Maybe Blue Sky should leave the Ice Age franchise alone now while it still has a couple of drops left in the river which seems to be rapidly running dry.*** <-- Three Stars"
94,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,19 July 2016,Nothing new,"Ice Age: Collision course is guaranteed Ice Age movie. As in good as in bad too. Movie includes some nice wordplay and some realization too. On the other hand it feels so familiar, like you have seen it before. Ice Age: Collision Course is clearly targeted to younger audience, so it has way too much stupid hazzel. It might laugh for children, but more mature audience feels himself irritating. As before, movies best part is squirrels fooleries after his acorn. This time squirrel escapades in space and makes whole solar system mixed. This time we will find out, for example where Jupiter got it's red spot. Rest of the movie is just all the same again. Wondering around glacier, stupid jokes and childish hazzle dazzle.Movie looks great, colorful and rich. 3D works well as usually in these animation movies. After all I don't think the movie is a worth of a movie ticket, so it is better to watch from DVD. I don't think that release won't take for long. It is also surprising, that we see this movie a week earlier here in Europe than USA. This movie won't bring anything new to this movie series."
95,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,12 August 2016,Plenty of fun buried in useless characters and overused ideas.,"The Ice Age series has always been extremely varied in terms of quality. The original was fun but not overly interesting, The Meltdown, easily the best of the series was fun and engaging, Dawn of the Dinosaurs was fun enough to be a nice breezy little adventure, and Continental Drift was a messy pile of bad concepts. Collision Course however, feels like all of this.The premise is awesome, taking Ice Age into space, and I feel it could've been enough to make this film one of if not the best in the series, but it's buried under a pile of concepts that are taken directly from previous films, mostly Dawn of the Dinosaurs.Now, there's nothing wrong with paying homage to concepts from previous films in the series, but it's when you realise that that concept was done so much better in the last film that it starts to feel awkward. Another problem I have is the sheer number of main characters in this film, and this is from someone who loves having plenty of main characters in a film just to ramp up the fun, but the narrative is not substantial enough to support all of these characters as well as the absurd amount of concepts it wants to utilise.Try and balance a rock heading for the Earth, Scrat trying to fly a UFO, Peaches getting married to another mammoth and Manny trying to connect with him, Buck trying to face of a trio of dino-birds, a mysterious city that keeps you young forever, and trying to launch a magnetic rock into the sky, then add Manny, Diego, Sid, Ellie, Crash, Eddie, Shira, Granny, Peaches, Buck and Scrat to the equation, and try and make it work. You can't, simple as!It feels like a checklist of things they wanted to do before, then they realised this may be their last chance to use all of this so they gave the writers a list of things to include, and I can see that the writers tried their best, but it still didn't work.The direction feels very similar to that of Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Continental Drift, which was OK but usually just felt like throwing endless concepts at the screen trying to get it to work. This is the same, it's so padded finding the proper story under all of these concepts it near impossible.Also, what's happened to Manny? Ever since Peaches was born he's turned into a one-dimensional character who's always worried about his daughter, which I understand is probably what a father character in his position might be like, but I can't help but feel he was so much more interesting before Continental Drift.The humour is sometimes OK, but I don't feel that there's enough of it to hide the glaringly obvious problems this film contains. The writing is quite intelligent at times, and there are some good puns along the way, but the entire time I got this feeling of ""been there and done that before, only it was better last time.""There's not a single awesome memorable moment that springs to mind with this film. With 'The Meltdown' I'll always remember the rock scene because it was awesome, and with the original I'll always remember the ice slide scene because it was so fun, but there's nothing I really remember about this film and I've just finished watching it.Overall, Collision Course suffers from being a muddled mess of concepts that would've worked very well on their own but don't quite work with everything else that felt the need to cram into the story. You may say it's just for kids and as long as they have a laugh that's all that matters right?, yeah sure, but I'm not even sure that kids will enjoy it, it's just so dull.I'd say it's worth giving a try because there were times when I was laughing and enjoying myself, just not many, and if you're a long time fan of the Ice Age series, like me, then you may enjoy yourself, just don't expect too much.Would I like another sequel? Sure, provided they do some things differently this time. Let's go back to the original trio, leave Ellie, Crash, Eddie, and the others behind for once, let's just have a nice fun adventure without the emotional concepts and relationship drama that really doesn't belong there. That way, it'll just be about the fun and that's all we want."
96,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,17 August 2016,I wanted it to be worse,"I think Ice age is the best animated movie of all time, however, not a single sequel has come even close to being as good. The fourth one was the biggest offender, being one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I wanted this to be worst, it was a disappointment. Its not as bad, Scratch was almost as funny as he was in the 2nd one, but for the rest, Manny cant get any worse than the previous one, Diego sucks, her girlfriend was useless, Sid was boring and the rest of the mammoths are really annoying. Im just tired of the F$%&ing rats and they found a way to ruin Buck, the last good character this franchise created. However, I kept a smile during most of the movie, and I guess this would be a fun watch for kids, but F$&K that. This is the worst movie of 2016 so far, but who cares, this thing already tripled its budget so please lets this franchise die, please, Im f$%&ing tired."
97,Ice Age: Collision Course,5,26 July 2016,Fifth trip to the frozen tundra.,"The ICE AGE franchise may have gone to the icy tundra one time too many. This trip is quite the calamity. Scrat (Chris Wedge), the squirrel, in pursuit of that great acorn finds himself in a flying saucer, packed in the frozen tundra, and accidentally puts the spacecraft on a trip out of the Earth's atmosphere and causing a series of cosmic mishaps that has space junk hurtling towards the icy planet.This dilemma has grouchy mastodon Manny (Ray Ramano) and his family and friends in ""helter skelter"" mode trying to divert doomsday. The speeding asteroid on its calculated path takes a demotion in Manny's priorities as his daughter announces her engagement. Multi-tasking and sometimes acrobatic shenanigans while trying to avoid the giant hunk of space junk will keep the younger audience glued to the screen. Adults may even find the collision course bearable. Sid (John Leguizamo), Diego (Denis Leary), Ellie (Queen Latifah) and the herd wonder as they wander leaving their frozen home in their quest of safety.Implausible or scientifically inaccurate; ICE AGE:COLLISION COURSE is cinematic fun. A host of familiar voices include: Jennifer Lopez, Simon Pegg, Keke Palmer, Sean William Scott, Wanda Sykes, Michael Strahan, Jessie J, Melissa Rauch, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Max Greenfield and Jess Tyler Ferguson."
98,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,27 July 2016,"Scrat, the supreme damn god of the clash of worlds and the Ice Age","Seriously, after all they did Is this the best they can do? The responsible directors Mike Thurmeier, Galen T. Chu and his team of lazy and stupid writers should be ashamed. They forgot that the issue should be the title is damn ICE AGE. Blue Sky seem to make sequels just for them and not for the public and which is their version of what they think happened in the GOD DAMN ICE AGE. This is everything i never want in a Ice Age sequel, the story is ridiculous and boring, the characters are very stupid and you don't care about them, the jokes are unfunny and the message is terrible, it doesn't connect with the plot. But the worst thing he did Blue Sky at this school is the Scrat character, not just what modernized, but they did a DAMN CHARACTER CARTOONIST. And instead of being the hero of the film and save the earth for bring destroyed, it becomes the supreme god of f*****g chaos, does not a d*** this character, his jokes are stupid and weird, and he has the lowest appearance in this sequel than the other sequels. I would give more importance to this character and know about his past, but we only know that Scrat makes one stupid joke. The rest of the characters are annoying and unfunny. The jokes are not effective expect of 2 pr 3 little laughs. And Ice Age: Collision Course is the worst Ice Age sequel. ¿Is there something good? Well, the animation is nice, the voice cast is decent and the score is okey. But from all the sequels they have, this is the worst. If is there going to be a sixth movie, i will kill the new makers and writers, and this is not more then sheer stupidity of children and adults. I warn you, don't expect anything great or amazing about this sequel, you will ask for their your money back.3.1/10"
99,Ice Age: Collision Course,9,4 August 2017,Why so much hate?!,This movie is HILARIOUSLY funny. I'm not sure why it has such bad reviews. My only complaint is that the antagonists barely got ANY screen time. I'm just glad they had development! :). Granny is defiantly the best part of this movie. She has so many great one liners. Really hoping for a 6th Ice Age movie!!!!
100,Ice Age: Collision Course,3,19 November 2016,Very lousy and boring,"It seems like all people behind Ice Age movies just got bored of coming up with new stuff and decided to do whatever because of popularity of franchise will bring them people and that's it. There are couple of new and entertaining scenes in the movie but they get so overthrown by those that are just bad and try to imitate other movies dialogues and in doing so just being sloppy. After 30 minutes of movie it was already so bad, boring and lame that almost became not watchable but then they throw one good scene at you just to keep you there and then continue like before. Predictability of movie and annoying characters with bad dialogue that led to some of outrageous scenes that are totally irrelevant and filling up movie time so it would last at least 90 minutes. Movie is just bad and if you liked this franchise this is going to be a torturous experience. 1/4"
101,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,5 October 2016,Ice Age: Infinite Warfare,"Or shall it be Ice Age: Modern Tom'n'Jerry? Whatever, it's yet another movie that goes by the trend ""So bad it's good"".When I watch it, I feel like there's still something there. It's like the psychiatric evaluation of a patient: the patient still shows signs of his former personality, albeit unconsciously, while now acting wildly, making weird noises, gesturing and cringing faces - and blabbering about the end of the world.The first movie was great, legendary even by cartoon standards, but it was what? Sad. Despite all the fun, it was very sad. And so they decided to add more and more craze, making the ""patient"" less and less human. The possums, Buck, Granny, and the ever-punchlin-ey Scrat - everything turned Ice Age into something dopey. Now it has everything and yet new characters, with a crazier than ever twist to Scrat... And I feel it's too much. There is no more Ice Age, only the tiny glean of the former cartoon - the characters. Their story is probably the only reason people dare to pay nowadays. Because no matter how predictable it is - it's so touching to see your favorite characters develop.But why... why turn it into a sitcom? Is there no better way to approach the youth chapter of Peaches' life? Nothing is explained, characters, their choices and actions, abilities and principles - are thrown right at you. Parents are overprotective. Daughter is rebellious, yet absolutely serious, skilled, pretty much ""better than her mama"". The guy is a... I don't know how to describe such people, I just... The guy from Doctor Dolittle 2, there.And it all resolves in the most American way possible. What will come next? A sitcom about Peaches raising a baby with overprotective grand-parents? Ugh... To be honest, if there will yet be another movie, I'd like a spin-off. Enough of the mammoths, enough of their ""herd"". It's getting into third generation soon, and that's probably a good place to put a dot. But a separate adventure of Diego and Shira(and possibly Sid) - that can be a refreshing story that can be worth a chapter."
102,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,4 October 2016,Why do we need another Ice Age movie?,"History tells us that the last Ice Age ended 11,700 years ago and all the animals died. The last Ice Age was 1,788,300 years. That's a lot of writing material for money hungry Hollywood writers! So instead of Ray Romano and Dennis Leary going extinct as they eventually should, they now have the opportunity to use their wily woolly ways and sabre-toothed prowess to help their gang get through a ""collision course"" in this case implying a catastrophic event that could actually decimate the planet and render all the furry creatures and life extinct...until our hairy knuckled cave dwelling forefathers came around! Unfortunately, we can never quite reach that point in this series where everyone dies and all life ceases to exist....because they keep making more of these awful movies. I have yet to find out what the perfect target audience for these films are, because the dialogue is too complex for young children and the lack of enthusiasm of the voice actors indicates that they're only doing it because the checks keep coming. On the other hand, I tried to watch it and it bored me to tears. I took my sons and my niece to see this movie in 3D. Now granted, the 3D effects were cool as Hell but holy crap was this story annoying and stupid. My kids were more interested in reclining the seats back and forth than actually watching this film. The only parts they did like were the scenes of the prehistoric squirrel still chasing after his nut....5-ish movies later. I would have preferred a film in which the squirrel is the main character rather than...God, that annoying stupid Woolly Mammoth played by Ray Romano who dials it in as an actor who just doesn't give a crap about this series anymore. Please Hollywood, if you're going to do another Ice Age movie, make it ICE AGE: They're all DEAD...and end this dumb franchise. I'm giving this a 4 but only because the 3D effects were cool."
103,Ice Age: Collision Course,,17 August 2016,a Squirrel Reorders the Universe,"""Road Runner""-style gags recycled in computer-smooth 3-D animation still pack some punch, as it happens. A scene in which an electrical storm menaces the movie's protagonists also generates some visual interest.The wide-ranging celebrity cast of voice talent here makes room for the astrophysicist Neil degassed Tyson as a version of himself, and Adam Devine as Manny and Ellie's would-be son-in-law, Julian, who repeatedly refers to Manny as ""Bro Dad,"" a habit that is precisely as unendearing as it sounds. Eagle-eyed parents can rest easy; the role of Peaches, the object of Julian's affections, is voiced by Keke Palmer, not the eponymous raunchy performing artist. I consider this a missed opportunity. GLENN KENNY""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for anthropomorphized prehistoric cartoon animal body- function humor, mostly."
104,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,19 July 2016,I would rather see a Scrat spin-off movie than having another Ice Age sequel,"The Ice Age franchise, now roughly 15 years old, started with the journey of Manny, Sid and Diego rescuing a human infant back in 2002. Since then, these mammals have been subjected to a meltdown, a dinosaur invasion, and a continental drift. By then, you'd think it'd be best for the gang to resume their peaceful off-screen lives until their extinction, but no, Blue Sky Studios draws one last breath from its cash-cow franchise. Tagged as the fifth and ""defining"" chapter of the series, Ice Age: Collision Course, sadly, unlike good wine, does not age well. What was fun a decade ago is now quickly losing its appeal. While kids will still probably enjoy this, not everyone buys that mediocrity can be casually brushed off because it is intended for kids.Collision Course kicks off with a Scrat prologue, an extended cut of the short film, ""Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe"", released last year. The saber-toothed squirrel inadvertently starts a spaceship with his acorn, catapults himself to space and radically arranges the Milky Way in the process. This chain of cosmic events also sends a huge asteroid to earth. Down below, Manny (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo) and Diego (Denis Leary) must face this disaster while dealing with their own midlife problems. Meanwhile, Buck (Simon Pegg), who appeared in Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, returns and claims to know how to divert the huge asteroid away from earth. Joined by their family and friends, our mammal heroes embark on a perilous path to save the world from an impending meteor shower. Will this mark the end of the Ice age? One certainly hopes so.This sequel follows the same set-up as the previous films: a global catastrophe looms, but the characters are too preoccupied with their respective dramas that the gravity of the situation doesn't really stick. As if taken straight from a sitcom, Manny and his wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) are troubled because their daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) wants to move out with his annoyingly upbeat fiancé Julian (Adam Devine). Diego and his girlfriend Kira (Jennifer Lopez) are having some pre-parenthood issues. And Sid, well, Sid is just there, being pathetic, until they throw him a girlfriend.If there is one thing that has continually progressed in this franchise, it is the animation, which is, however, pretty much a given nowadays.Of course, Scrat and his Sisyphean quest for that elusive acorn remain to be the only selling point for me. For 15 years, I have been bewildered why he just won't eat that damn acorn already. Blue Sky Studios should have made a spin-off about his character rather than put out this sequel. If you've reached the point when you would rather watch a silent comedy for hours rather than invest in the main story, something is clearly wrong with the script.Ice Age: Collision Course fails to reinvent itself to sustain genuine excitement even from its loyal fanbase. With the number of characters jammed in this sequel, not much time is spent on exploring more important themes. Save for some Looney Tunes-esque sideshows, the storyline is running out of steam and is definitely not close to the quality of Pixar films. The harsh cold truth is this: the Ice Age franchise has run its course and exhausted its options, ultimately freezing itself from the hot stuff it once was."
105,Ice Age: Collision Course,4,15 July 2016,Meltdown with asteroids,"The is my review of Ice Age: Collision Course (spoiler free) ** (2/5)Cast: Ray Romano, John Laguizamo, Dennis Leary, Simon Pegg, Queen Latifah Plot: Manny (Romano), Diego (Leary), and Sid (Laguizamo) join up with Buck (Pegg) to fend off a meteor strike that would destroy the world.What the hell has this series come to? Back in 2002 this was an original animation that really hadn't been done before and it was amazing, not flawless and definitely not Oscar worthy except from being nominated but it was fun and it was a real good time. Back we didn't if there was going to be a series to it but here we are 14 years later and the Ice Age franchise now filled with five movies and no sign of Chris Saldanha (one of the original directors) but since Chris Saldahna became one of the directors for Despicable Me (2010) this series, which was still fun to watch at the time turned to pot and it just started getting worse from there. Now each new Ice Age introduced new characters only a few at first but the good things about them characters is they all had a funny story with them whether it be Ellie (Latifah), who thought she was part possum to the insane Buck (Pegg) when the series messes with Palaeontology and finally pirates when it messed with Geology, but again that was when the series was still coming up with original ideas and they were still fun to watch and to enjoy. However this still has its fun moments and still has an original idea but now it is beyond stupid and quite frankly gone too far away from the goodness that was the first one.The film starts off with the characters we love obviously having a game of turtle hockey but you shouldn't expect it to dwindle on that part because no matter how funny it may be, with the dialogue and the well jokes that try to be funny but really aren't, and as the film introduces new characters again this time there is no story about the characters it just carries on, and although this may be fun for kids to the adults will be wondering ""what the hell are we watching?"" and you'll be right to think that. This movie messes with astrophysics now all though you may be thinking that's a fun way to end the series it's just so wrong and fuzzy (Not just Sid's fur at one point) and as this carries one with its old-ish jokes that is really what this film is good for now. The story goes on of course with Scrat (Chris Wedge one of the original directors) who we know as being un-killable being just as hapless as he normally is and again you may laugh when he gets into all sorts of trouble, with the stories main aspect of getting a mysterious UFO the he has found and while he tries to make it work off it goes playing Pinball with the rest of the Solar System.However it seems that the writers just aren't trying anymore and though it still has fun moments with the endless bum jokes that may make kids squeal with delight as some of them are very funny. It just seems that the writers came up to a blank point and just made this one up as it went along; yes the series is now running on fart fumes. But what made this series good back in the day that only the older generation will remember is that it was funny and just endless fun this one is just stupid, and quite frankly an unfunny disastrous catastrophe. In conclusion if you want a happy ending of the series which we reached two films ago or so we thought, this one ends exactly the same as the previous one except much worse. In case you're wondering this one is set on the same island that the clan reached at the end of Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012). Finally at the end you can kiss your ice goodbye as this is the last in the series, it was fun well the first four films were, if you are an Ice Age fan and love the animation then maybe you should stick with the previous ones. Finally this proves that animations are only good the first few times or just one time in Pixar's case.VERDICT: Silly, stupid and quite frankly glad it's ended. Although this still has its fun moments that may make kids laugh this really has gone too far to really be fun anymore.4/10 hapless unfunny fifth instalment in a series that should have had really had four."
