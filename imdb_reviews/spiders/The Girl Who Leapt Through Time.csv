0,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,16 June 2007,A Nutshell Review: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,"The poster of this animated movie looks a little suggestive, but nope, it's actually a wholesome time travel movie which explores a little on the vestment of such powers to a klutzy individual, as well as relationships, and the perennial question of what would anyone do if you have the ability to go back into time, and make changes presumably for the better.The Girl Who Leapt Through Time tells a wonderful story centered on 3 friends, the tomboyish and clumsy Makoto Konono (voiced by Riisa Naka), and two hunks Chiaki Mamiya (Takuya Ishida) and Kousuke Tsuda (Mitsutaka Itakura). Theirs is a friendship formed after school at the baseball court where they spend quality time talking about typical teenage stuff. Things start to change however, when Makoto by accident gets the power to time travel, and in her own ditzy way, uses her new found abilities for ""good"" - directly for herself, or in some Emma like moments, to influence the outcome of relationships for her friends and play matchmaker.And that's just scratching the tip of the iceberg. While it's animation style is kept simple and fairly straightforward, it doesn't compromise on the complexity of its storyline. Not that it serves to confuse, rather you'll be amazed by the amount of pathos the story contains, with its various subplots especially when the time travelling stuff kicks in. It has adult sensibilities in the treatment of the plot, and knows exactly when to hit the right emotional chords when warranted.Although based on a book, the story here serves as a quasi-sequel of sorts which takes place some 20 years later, what I can say is that the love stories intertwined has its major one being able to touch like that in Be With You. I loved that movie, and watching how this bore some similarities, you can't help but feel the same emotions coming across in the same way, nevermind that the characters here are animated, as you can feel the pain, the love, and their despair. And that is something that I should say is difficult for the genre - they're not real persons on screen - but yet being able to evoke emotions and for one to react and empathize, definitely makes it powerful, and a cut above others. Something that our local animated films had failed to do in giving us cold characters and bastardized stories from folklore.But it's not always all the time serious in tone or mood. The movie has light hearted moments, sometimes bordering on the slapstick, no thanks to the bumbling Makoto character. In a sequence, it was reminiscent of Chinese Odyssey starring Stephen Chow, where each time travel moment gets played ad nausem with different comedic effect. Undoing blunders as we see is not exactly Makoto's forte, and while she may be using her powers in a carefree way, with great powers come great responsibilities (sorry, can't resist that one!)As usual, anyone can find fault with the time travel paradox which rears its ugly head in any time travel movie, but I would suggest that you park those thoughts aside, and enjoy the story that the Girl Who Leapt Through Time is telling. There are slight attempts at addressing it with its creation of totally new and different realities with each jump, but even then a major paradoxical flaw still exists. At its lowest denominator, the film reminds to seize the day like it's your last, do what's right, and don't be shy in telling someone how you feel about them.The Best Animated Film of the recent Awards of the Japanese Academy, this film gets my vote of support too with its superbly emotional and touching tale, and with its similarities to that aspect of the film which I like to Be With You, it will be no surprise if this movie finds its way to my Top Ten of the year. Highly recommended!"
1,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,31 July 2006,Highly recommended!,"Having watched the trailers on the net for Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo (official English title: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time), I've been looking forward to it for a while. With character designs by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, the same guy who did those for Neon Genesis Evangelion, and animation by Madhouse, Tokikake (as it is nicknamed in Japan), is a great-looking movie. Lively and interesting backgrounds, lush colours and detailed animation, it's a joy to look at. Particular mention must be made of the time-leaping effect, which gives you a sense of breathlessness. The voice acting is extremely enjoyable, with the voice actors really managing to convey their characters' personalities, while endearing them to the viewer. The music is great, with a wonderfully wistful theme song ""Garnet"", provided by Hanako Oku. The direction is interesting, with some really nice shots effectively conveying the more important events and scenes. Overall, I really enjoyed Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo, which is why it is such a mystery as to why it is only showing in one cinema house in all of Tokyo. With Gedo Senki generally failing to live up to people's expectations, were Tokikake shown in a few more cinemas, it could have the potential to be the surprise blockbuster of the summer. Definitely to be recommended over Gedo Senki as the anime movie of the summer."
2,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,25 June 2009,"Though not flawless, very well thought out.","The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a very original, well thought-out fantasy about traveling through time. It's categorized as Sci-Fi on IMDb and has quite a decent ranking in the genre. However, Sci-fi is only a secondary tool used in the story. The whole movie has a strong undertone of philosophy. I am glad that I could watch it in HD.Makoto is a jumpy, goofy and lovely highshoolgirl in her senior year. She has 2 buddies in the class, but doesn't know one of them is having a crush on her. Later, she obtained a special ability of leaping through times, and escaped a train accident using this ability. Inspired suddenly, she dumped herself into a time-traveling life that seemed perfect, until......Don't get it wrong. This is definitely not Back To the Future or Terminator. It's never heavy enough to depress you, yet it got messages delivered. The movie blends ordinary life into the fantasy, which gave you another way to look at our ordinary lives. Makoto was cumulating her ego and gradually becoming ignorant after the magic worked time to time . This is a reflex to anyone that became arrogant after some achievements. Chasing after her personal desire for too long, Makoto finally realized the worst consequences always come from the smallest mistakes. Therefore a great portion of this film is about her trying to fix everything back and forth. Different from Butterfly Effects, this movie dealt with such topics in a comedian way. Makoto's goofy personality never gets old, yet it's very involving to see the whole story from her perspective. The romance, although cartooned, had a very realistic touch concerning the youngsters. In Eastern culture, teenagers aren't really supposed to date each other, since their lives only cross each other's at this very innocent, immature and short time. this film rendered the whole feeling to a new level, that at least ties with If You Listen Closely (Whisper of the Heart). It's more surreal and fascinating at times, and finally come to a conclusion that's as beautiful as it's poetic.Although Hayao Miyazaki had raised the bar of animation features (in Japan and worldwide) for more than 2 decades, The Girl Who leapt Through Time still stood out on its own. After I watched this, I could only say, ""Rest in peace, Mr. Miyazaki, for somebody is coming to take your legacy."" Visually, it's not entirely detailed as some of Miyazaki's recent works. In one viewing you can fetch all the themes and little Eastern eggs the director intended. But this one viewing may touch you deeply. Have you ever ignored another girl/boy, who tried to give you her/his puppy love and first kiss? Or have you ever ignored another human being who got into a lot of troubles without your help? Makoto's tears were shed several times during 1 hour 38 minutes, giving me a lot of chances to reflect on my own ego and personality.What if? What if I could give more attention to him/her...? We ask such stupid questions in real life? The movie's not silly. It's a good movie for kids, teenagers, young adults, middle-ages and elders. No wonder it's so worldly welcomed.9/10 superb direction and art design, with a heartful story to reflect on."
3,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,21 June 2010,Timeless Masterpiece,"There are about 10 Japanese films that I re-watch almost every year since their releases. ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is one of only three such animated films for me.""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is based on a 1967 hit novel of the same title. The original work has been used in numerous film and dorama adaptations, most famous ones being the 1983 film directed by Oobayashi Nobuhiko. Instead of making just another anime adaptation and possibly becoming just another adaptation shadowed by the 1983 film, the producers took a risk by creating a spin-off movie with the setting of about 20 years after the original story. The gamble paid off big time, as the animated film went on to win at least 23 awards worldwide.The underlying theme in this movie was ""the importance of living the moment"". Our protagonist was given the power to leap back into time to correct her mistakes, only to realize later that the short-term gains only lead to greater losses that followed. The story was extremely well-constructed to teach the lesson of embracing things the way they are, and never run from confrontations, because once that moment gone, you'll never get it back.The director for this film did a phenomenal job of pacing and creating many memorable moments, but it was the live-action film screenwriter Okudera Satoko, who really made a difference for this movie by composing a story out of number of time leaps that slowly developed the main characters and made so many epic scenes possible. Many anime screenwriters fail in movies because they incorporate too many characters, as it is common practice in series, into the limited 100 minute time-frame. What's remarkable about this piece of work is that it focuses on only three main characters. Even counting the secondary cast, there are only 8 characters in total who we are given the names of. The limited number of characters not only improved character development, it also allowed the story to focus on the underlying theme.I was actually very uncertain about the viewing this year because I started watching a lot of TV anime again since the last viewing. However, the only new flaws I've noticed was the excessive still motion in some scenes and most backgrounds, and that the protagonist was being a bit overly insensitive in few instances, which made her character a bit unrealistic. Animation is years ahead of its time, and it still is an excellent example of what happens when music is in harmony with the story/animation. The insert song by Oku Hanako, IMO, is still the best selection ever made among hundreds of Japanese films, anime, and live-action doramas I've encountered. Ending theme is a truly poignant one that really captured the mood and made the story sink in, and the music score throughout the movie has been used perfectly to enhance the drama.""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a timeless masterpiece that made me want to cherish every moment, and it's a movie I expect myself to be re-watching for many more years to come."
4,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,4 March 2007,"I laughed, I cried, I sat on the edge of my seat","I saw this film at the US premiere at the New York International Children's Film Festival and it really knocked my socks off.The plot of the film has a high school senior named Makoto Konno going through life blissfully hanging out with friends, and trying to cope with the pressures of being a high schooler. On a day when everything is going wrong Makoto suddenly discovers that she has somehow become able to leap through time. Suddenly able to relive great days or correct past mistakes she thinks she has somehow managed to to find a way to make her wishes (and those of her friends) come true. Unfortunately it soon becomes clear that some of the changes have consequences that she never intended.(I dare not say too much more since the revealing too much will clue you in too early as to whats going on in the film, perhaps taking a bit of the edge off the wonder. Trust me you'll thank me once you see the film yourself).More like a novel than a movie this film takes its time getting to where its going and its better for it. Here we have a bunch of likable kids who are simply trying to get out of school and go on to the next level, at the same time trying to deal with things like lost puddings and the members of the opposite sex. Since we get to know and to like the kids (and adults) we become invested in what happens to them. Will they make the right choice? Who can say when you have the ability to do it over again.One of the better animated features of the last year (from any country) this is a smart drama/comedy/romance/thriller. This is unlike any American animated film of recent vintage in that it talks to its audience with out dumbing everything down or needing to follow some corporate formula for success. Here is a film that is more than just dumb jokes, but is instead about people. This is a movie that should be seen by anyone who wants to see a great movie, and not just an animated one."
5,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,28 June 2009,Modern Remake of a Classic !,"The company that made this movie - Madhouse is aptly named, because this movie is insane. What happens when an average high school girl discovers she has ability to travel in time ? Makoto discovers she has ability to move back in time, and she ""jumps"" to correct for all the inconvenient things that happened to her in the past days which includes getting better grades in her exams, exchanging position with another person to avoid getting involved in a chem lab fire, avoiding collision with a guys who's getting thrown across the lawn, eating a pudding before her sister gets to it etc.. All these made possible because she's already experienced them once.Based on a novel by Yasutaka Tsutsui, The girl who leapt through time, or Toki o kakeru shojo (a.k.a. Tokikake) is an animated version of a classic which has been made into a movie, and TV drama in the past with live actors. This is a modernized version reflecting cultural changes in the way youth perceives the world around them. What haven't changed much is the city scape of Japan in the urban area, and it's interesting to compare this movie to the one made back in the '80s.The plot takes maximum advantage of what funny things a person can do when they have the ability to travel in time, and this is done in good humor which is insanely fun to watch.Some connection to the movie with same title made in the '80s also by Kadokawa is hinted as Makoto's aunt is Kazuko Yoshiyama who was the Girl that leaped through time in the '80s version.Voice over is superb (in the Japanese version), and the voice and character of Makoto matches so perfectly.One of the best anime to come from Japan in recent years, this movie is highly recommended for anime fans, and Asian movie fans alike."
6,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,11 January 2008,Wow.,"This film is one of those films that comes once in every generation. The voice actors give the characters a sense of realness that makes you suffer or feel joy. The detail of the work is phenomenal and the story doesn't drag or end in a familiar way. I specially like the detail they put to little things as the sliding doors bouncing back open when Makoto tries to close them. This is one of those films that in the end it leaves you a good feeling and not guilty for spending two hours enjoying yourself. When you see this film you might have to find time to think when was the last time you saw something so good.I just wish there's a sequel for it, because I just couldn't get enough of it. But maybe is one of those stories that you wish it never ended but you know that it has to end.P.S. Now I have to buy the DVD."
7,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,30 June 2008,Great movie. Tops on my list,"Well, to put it really simple: You must watch this movie.The story basically shows how a girl named Makoto deals with her power to leap through time. At first she concentrates on making her life ""better"", however, she soon finds out that every time she leaps back to change something to her advantage others could be affected.It is a beautiful story that teaches you to embrace things the way they are, to try to make thing better but to understand that what has already happened cant and should not be changed.As I already said, you have to see this movie, even if you are not an anime fan."
8,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,6,16 March 2013,Why are the Japanese so into stories of High School Romance,"Before I watched this movie I had watched a marathon of Anime at Glasgow Film Theater which included Wolf Children, From Up On Poppy Hill and 5 Centimeters Later. There's quite a few things I saw recurring in each of them. High School Romances that stem from awkward interactions, either between two separated friends or a girl who can't tell her feelings to a boy, which lead to lots of tears over their incapability to proclaim their love and stress over hesitant confessions leading to no confession at all. I don't mind Romances in stories, in fact I'm writing my own story where two childhood friends get together, but there are way too many simplistic tear fests in animes, in fact all across animation love stories are developing too quickly. These animes also have a tendency to make the romantic side of the story seem like a death scene from the Grudge. The girl is totally petrified of the guy's feelings towards her in those cases but in others their feelings are immediately mutual. If getting a girlfriend was this easy I would've moved to Japan years ago I began to really like this movie. Great animation, a strong and independent female character, who for the whole time fought against her strengths with short skirts and hanging around men. Although the idea of a time travelling device being disguised as a walnut was pretty stupid it was funny and enthralling up until the last 20 minutes where it turned into another high school romance story with a lot of unexplored plot points like one guy's reason for going back in time, why time travel was invented (other than allowing silk haired hunks to get girlfriends). And what kind of ending was that. The main character goes back in time, altering everything she had altered on her own for that boy only to be told he was going back . Why? What about the crappy timeline he lives in, which he went to the past to avoid, is so great that after spending years in the past he wants to go back there?"
9,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,8 July 2007,"The best of the ""Tokikake"" Movies...","""Toki O Kakeru Shojo"" (or Tokikake) is probably the most adapted modern short story in Japanese Literature. As of date, there have been six different versions of the Tsutsui Yasutaka story in both TV and movies -- the NHK drama ""Time Traveler ('72) with Shimada Junko; the '83 movie with Harada Tomoyo; the Fuji TV Drama special ('84) with Minamino Yoko; the Fuji TV Drama special ('94) with Uchida Yuki; the '97 movie with Nakamoto Nana; the TBS TV special ('02) with Abe Natsumi and now Hosoda Mamoru's anime movie. Yet director Hosada (Digimon TV series, One Piece) and screenwriter Okudera Satoko (Concent, Kakko No Kaidan 2) took the unique approach of crafting not just another tired adaptation of the novel but rather developed a sequel to the events of the novel which covered a lot of the same themes but with inventive and interesting twists.While at first I had my doubts, I quite enjoyed this movie and consider it my favorite of the ""Tokikake"" movies. Konno Makoto (voiced with great enthusiasm and likability by Naka Riisa) is your typical Japanese high school student who deals with typical teen problems at school and home. Her best friends include brainy hunk Tsuda Kousuke (Itakura Mitsutaka) and happy-go-lucky transfer student Mamiya Chiaki (Ishida Takuya). As with the novel and previous movies, Makoto's world is suddenly turned upside down as she develops the ability to traverse backwards in time (in this case, through a ""time leaping"" device hidden within a walnut shell). What is unique about this movie (and what sets it apart from the previous adaptations) is the exploration of the ramifications of Makoto's ""time leaping"" powers. Whereas before in the novel and movies, heroine Yoshiyama Kazuko/Yoshikawa Tomoko was able to time travel with no real consequence or impact on those around her, the heroine here sees the impact that her powers have on others. At first Makoto uses her powers without abandon and almost in a reckless manner. In time however she soon discovers that not only does her powers change the course of events for herself but also the lives of others. One of the saddest lessons we learn along with Makoto is that ""precious moments"" can't be recaptured or replayed in time.There are fun tips of the hat to the novel and previous movies as well. Makoto's eccentric aunt (a museum painting restoration artist) is hinted to be Yoshiyama Kazuko, the heroine from the novel (a lavender branch is seen near a photo of her as a teen) and the accident that gives Makoto the powers of time travel occur once again in a school laboratory during classroom cleanup duty, similar to the movies.The animation, compliments of the famed Madhouse Studio (Perfect Blue, Paprika, Millennium Actress) are exceptional. The characters move with fluid and vibrant life and the CGI parts are very captivating.While I miss the 1983 theme song by Harada Tomoyo, the soundtrack music by Yoshida Kiyoshi and theme song ""Garnet"" by Oku Hanako are serviceable.""The Girl Who Lept Through Time"" (a much better title than the often used ""The Girl Who Conquered/Traversed Time"") is a wonderfully touching, funny and captivating movie that teaches us to enjoy those small moments in time for they can never be recaptured again."
10,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,27 December 2008,I'll Tell You Some Other Time,"Rarely do I buy a film on DVD without having either read up about it or seen it first. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time was the first exception for me. For a dull anecdote, I walked through the store, saw it, and bought it, without knowing anything other than what was written on the back. When i got home, I didn't even start to watch it! But waited until after dinner to watch it, and to cut the already long story short, watching this movie was an experience! From the very first scenes I was grabbed. The artwork, I must say I adore, the scenery is beautiful. As for the storyline, sure, we've had time-travelling stories before, but there's never been one which after seeing it, made me want to watch it again (Seriously, as soon as it was over, I watched it again!) Cutting the even-longer story short again, I highly recommend this film, even those who are not lovers of anime might find themselves enjoying this film. Watching this movie was like an experience for me, and as odd as it may sound, I felt really warm inside after watching this. 9/10."
11,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,30 December 2008,The Boy who Loved the Film,"What an amazing film this was. Its funny, its heartwarming, its emotional during certain points and if you are in touch with your emotional side, there is a chance that you will cry buckets. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a Japanese animated film that dwells in high school life and all that comes with it, the crushes, the puppy love, the platonic friendship and friendship that soon blossoms into romance. To spice things up a bit, the creators incorporated time travel in the mix and gave it to our klutzy heroine Makoto and the end result is absolutely satisfying as it manages to hit all the right spots and tug your heartstrings. The animation is just gorgeous to look at. It reminds you of a Ghibli movie due to its breathtaking use of rich colors and lavish texture, the film itself almost comes alive with its near perfect animation. The voice work done is perfect as well, integrating it seamlessly into the film thus giving life to the colorful and cheerful characters on screen. While the Sci-fi part and the time travel stuff may not be ironed out to the highest level, I suggest you leave your Einstein mindset right at the doorstep and just enjoy the story that the film is telling. All in all, if you look at it, the film is a touching tale bursting with emotions and it just warms your heart in all the right places. Highly recommended."
12,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,10 September 2007,Definitely a favorite anime,"Hosoda Mamoru's The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is an imaginative story about a girl who accidentally becomes able to go back in time to replay her day's events with a simple leap (its never made explicit, but it seems the harder she leaps, the further she goes back in time, but you never know.) Its basically a shojo style anime where the girl takes center stage and faces tough questions about growing up. Of course, these tough questions are given a new spin because not only can she literally avoid answering them, but change what she says once she says it. The film is so well done, however, that it never becomes even remotely obtuse and is easily followed from beginning to end.The animation is absolutely gorgeous, combining hand drawn and digital through high tech layering software, and achieving a combined effect of realism and beauty that few cartoons can lay claim to (in this way it felt a sister film to Takahata's Only Yesterday and My Neighbors the Yamadas.) If you find yourself staring endlessly at the backgrounds, you're not alone. Nature is on full display in this film, and the characters that inhabit it never seem far from a stream or flock of birds. Sunlight glinting off of sign posts, fields saturated in pastel greens, and the cozy warmth of indoor nesting play a large part in setting the mood. Character designs are detailed but not distracting, with all the main characters having expressive unique faces that don't veer off into the Anime extremes. The sound is a huge factor in the film, as it should be in all animation in my opinion, with subtle and effective voice work.I have a feeling this will become one of my most watched animes. It has a sense of humor about itself, but the emotional notes ring very true. You find yourself caught up in a world where reality isn't exactly what it should be, but the stakes aren't all that high in the larger universal context. What you end up with is a story about relationships, ethics, communication, and the inevitability of making mistakes.Hosoda Mamoru was a Studio Ghibli animator and was set to direct Howl's Moving Castle, but declined and went on to work on his own projects. Howl's Moving Castle seems, in retrospect, like the last movie in the world this director should be involved with. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time reminds me more of Kondo Yoshifumi's If You Listen Closely (or Whispers of the Heart), one of my most beloved films, about a young girl also facing adulthood who lives partly in a world of fancy. For this film he's been nominated for a number of awards, and hopefully will begin work on new projects soon.This film is available with on DVD with English subtitles in Korea."
13,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,1 July 2007,A Great One,"Alert: This movie has the most fantastic background graphics, equal in quality to the very best--like cowboy bebop or something from studio ghibli (spirited away). just wonderful color of the sunsets, schools houses etc.As a teen slice of life/tentative romance/drama the story seems like it could be cliché, but they do interesting things with it, make it more dramatic in the middle, and at the end i was satisfied. the emotional depth sort of sneaks up on you.Sounds were well-integrated into the film and the voice actors were spot-on in their portrayals.just a fine experience watching this on here in Asia.Highly recommended for all, but a must for anyone who's into anime.wow I'm gonna look out for anything by this studio and director in the future."
14,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,6,6 December 2014,One leap too many?,"THE GIRL WHO LEAPT THROUGH TIME is wholeheartedly worth a watch for its beautiful animation and nice character design (this coming from a not-very-into-anime person). It's a very pretty film. And for most of its runtime, there's a great lighthearted tone and polished comic sensibility that make things very enjoyable. But things fall apart in the last 30 minutes or so where the tone drastically shifts and everything loses steam. GIRL works best when it's dabbling in teen movie fare, where it's charms are inherent. I couldn't help but be disappointed by the ending, which feels rather disparate from everything that came before it.6/10"
15,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,6,3 November 2015,"Great animation, so-so story","Another anime based on older source material; in this case, Yasutaka Tsutui's 1967 novel of the same name.The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is an undeniably charming piece of animation, with a deceptively simplistic visual style. Deceptive because your first impression is of how clean and uncluttered it feels, almost minimalist, but then you gradually become aware of subtle layers of detail, which never compete for your eye's attention but are there if you allow your gaze to drift around the frame.The plot, concerning a high school girl, Makoto, who discovers the ability to leap backwards through time, is quirkily entertaining, if slight. It's got a kind of 80s feel to it - the sort of movie you could easily imagine getting made back then, when literally everyone was leaping around time in Air Jordans and drainpipe jeans - sort of like Quantum Leap meets Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Temporal back flips and metaphysical wizardry aside, it does basically boil down to a teen romance played out across time and space. It verges on being schmaltzy, and suffers from the same gaping plot holes that beleaguer any film concerning time travel. Nevertheless, it's quite entertaining and the animation is something to behold."
16,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,4 November 2012,"Excellent all around, perhaps the best film of 2006","This is a great film. I gave only 9/10 because I would give only 10/10 for something truly special (such as Princess Mononoke, in terms of Japanese Animated films), but considering in itself, it is an almost flawless masterpiece alright. On the level of the best of the best and indeed it is probably the best film of 2006 (considering that I didn't think that much of Pan's Labyrinth). It is a really touching film and the director, also responsible for the great Summer Wars, is truly a master of his craft as he knows how to hit every emotional chord of the viewer. I finished this film feeling deeply satisfied at the experience, recommended for everyone who likes a good film. And yes, it is animated, so?"
17,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,7,3 November 2014,A solid animated film that gets a little convoluted for it's own good.,"The film premise is excellent, a young teenager able to go back in time and fix what is wrong. I mean, what is the worst that can happen? Well some of the worst does.The actress portraying Makoto does a great job with her role and the film does a good job itself showing a high-school kid's life. However, things become magical when she realizes the power of time travel and tries to fix the wrong in her life. However, she fixes what possibly should have not been fixed and puts a strain on both her and her friends.It gets a little too complex for it's own good, especially around 3/4ths of the way thorough the film. Sub-plots should have been explained a bit longer and the pace should have probably been slowed down just a little bit. The audience almost expected for something to go wrong and that is potentially a bad thing here as it feels like it weighs down the plot and makes the revelations either arbitrary or more of a Deus ex machina.7.4"
18,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,4 May 2011,A beautiful tale of a Time-Leaper,"Makoto is an ordinary schoolgirl who encounters a strange object that allows her to leap through time. With this great power she uses it to sort out her grades and change the destinies of those around her, but then strange markings begin to appear on her arm, after every time leap the markings change.I've watched Anime films in the past, mostly action orientated films; but I have to say the title drew me to this movie for some strange reason.Throughout the film I honestly believed that the director was truly dedicated in telling a story and he gave it 110%, and it showed in every scene and in every characters. You may even think that time travel movies are all the same...the same scene done a little different, you couldn't be more wrong, this movie adds humour to the repeated scenes in numerous different ways. I personally like to watch foreign films in their original language, but I ended up with the dubbed version...however, the voice dubbers did justice for such a beautiful movie. The ending is a tear-jerker, I saw it coming...but I was not prepared."
19,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,4 January 2011,""" Best and truly Unforgettable Japanese animated-film made ever!..","The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is one of those great Japanese animated-films made ever. Mamoru Hosoda had done an awesome job in making this Japanese animated science-fiction/romance film. And I was really touched and amazed after I watched this film. It made me realized how important time can be. And for yourself to value your life and make it more appreciated. I also love the concept of the movie how it twisted like that. And it may bring you disappointment for seeing more of it but will surely make you heartfelt and contented in the end of it. In other words, I can also say that this anime-film has a great and unforgettable story that everyone will loved and enjoy. Especially for those anime-film lovers and even to those viewers that are not an anime-fanatic, I will recommend this film to all of you guys!! You are surely gonna love this Japanese animated-film."
20,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,24 October 2010,See this anime before your time-jumps expire!,"Time waits for no one, unless your a 17-year-old high school student named Makoto Konno. After a mysterious event in the science lab and later being hurled into two oncoming trains, Makoto discovers that instead of dyeing she gains the ability to ""leap"" backwards through time re-living periods of her life again. Reminiscent of both ""Run Lola Run"" and ""Groundhog Day"" it begins as a playfully fun comedy of errors then shifts gears, as Makoto begins to realize the consequences of using her new powers thoughtlessly. She literally falls on her face several times before she comes to learns some hard life lessons about what is really important and what she needs to do to make things right again before her time-jumps expire. The ending is bittersweet, heartwarming and triumphant. It is not surprising that this anime is so good when you realize it was made by several talented ex-Ghibli studio refugees. After buying this movie I have watched it again and again."
21,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,9 September 2010,A gem of an anime feature.,"""I wonder how someone was able to create such a beautiful painting, when it must have seemed that the world was coming to an end.""When high school student Makoto inadvertently discovers that she's gained the ability to leap (literally) backward through time, she immediately begins using it to her advantage - with little concern for how and why she's gained this mysterious power. No problem is too trivial to be solved by a little time travel, from pop quizzes to uncomfortable conversations. But, nothing in the past can be changed without consequence, and Makoto's frivolous use of her ability may result in one or more of her friends being lost forever.The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is about as mainstream and accessible as anime gets. The characters are all pretty normal, likable, and relatable. There's a lot of humor in the first half of the story, while the last half is quite serious, heartfelt, and poignant. The animation and character designs are clean and smooth, and have a very modern appeal. The score has a lot of piano pieces that occasionally caught my ear in a very pleasant way.I recommend this both to anime fans, and to those who aren't particularly familiar with eastern animation. The story is an entertaining mix of moments both somber and lighthearted, the characters are great, and the visuals were top-notch. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time isn't just a good animated movie, it's good by any standards."
22,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,7 January 2009,"A pleasant, surprising ""Leap"" Through Time","17-year-old Makoto Konno is having a bad day. She's late for school, she fails a pop quiz, she burns up her home economics class, and her sister ate her stash of pudding. To top off a great day, she gets into a horrendous accident that propels her through time.And so goes the time-traveling Japanese Anime' (Japanese animation) odyssey ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,"" the most pleasant, engaging, heart-warming, and funny animated feature I've seen from Japan in a long time. This Anime' was directed by Mamoro Hosoda from the novel by Yasutaka Tsutsui. ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" (which is about as original and inviting and simplistic as a movie title could possibly get) is actually a sequel of sorts to a novel also written by Yasutaka Tsutsui over 40 years ago, and the story has been adapted into two live-action films released in 1983 and 1997.Makoto Konno is a bright, but not super-smart junior-year high school student. She's pretty, but not beautiful, and her life is exceptionally ordinary. She's also not all that popular and has some trouble with the guys. So when you throw time travel into the mix - possibly using elements from fanfare like H.G. Wells's ""The Time Machine,"" ""The Terminator"" (1984), and ""Back to the Future"" (1985) as inspirations - what can possibly go wrong?At first, Makoto uses time travel to improve little trivial matters in her own life, like waking up earlier so she can be on-time for class, pass her pop quiz, and avoid the fire in home economics. And she can get to the pudding before her sister does! However, as she continues traveling back in time and righting certain wrongs in her life, she soon discovers that her actions are having adverse affects on her family and friends, especially her two best pals Kousuke and Chiaki. Things become complicated when these time travel machinations force Chiaki to profess his love for her (among another alarming secret), and Makoto is forced to travel back in time to avoid the inevitable.""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,"" even with its blending of teen comedy, teen drama, sci-fi and romance, never finds the time to step into the many time travel paradoxes prevalent in such movies dealing with this subject matter. The film also never wallows in any kind of philosophical angst, pity, or musings about the future and how to avoid it by going back in time. The movie avoids these paradoxes simply because they're not relevant here.The animation is pretty simple and straight-forward without any real complexity; the story is too simple for it. Everything the story needs to tell us is right there for us. But the story does take an unexpected turn to avoid a horrific tragedy for one of the film's main characters. This tragedy turns an otherwise pleasant ride in Anime' into a desperate attempt to change the entire course of the film's events. And this tragedy is resolved in an unexpected, thoughtful, and romantic fashion. The love story here is probably the most interesting thing about the picture, even more than the obvious science fiction elements in the story, which will probably be the most interesting thing for fans of the genre.""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a pleasant and fun ride - most of the time in this picture. You can watch this movie - alone or with other Anime' fans - and not hate yourself for doing so.10/10"
23,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,6,18 September 2008,not as good as expected,"I must say that with all the raving reviews of Toki wo kakeru shoujo, I was expecting a much better movie. I usually like anime, and I agree that on the technical aspect, this movie is near flawless: The style is nice and simple, the animation is excellent (though some 3d scenes look a little rough), the backgrounds are amazing, and the music is nice ( maybe just a little on the generic side). But I'm trying to be as objective as I can here.However, I think that there are serious problems on the pacing and the story. The pace rushes through the beginning of the film, but halfway through, it abruptly stops, and very strangely finishes in a slow, anti-climatic fashion. In the same way, the story begins very lighthearted, comedic approach, and progresses nicely to a more serious situation building up tension, but there are some events in the end that simply mess up the whole basic idea. Being a time travel story it should be very careful with paradoxes but it ends up being overly complicated, with no explanations about several conflicts, and still doesn't manage to avoid inconsistencies. I understand that the movie is a part of a series of stories about the subject, and maybe reading them all, the final twists might make more sense.. But as a stand-alone story, its very far from coherent.In my opinion the romantic comedy + subtle science fiction elements were enough for the movie to be very good. I must say I was very interested halfway through the film. But it tries to go further adding complexity and fails. By itself, the characterization and the script of the different situations is very good. It feels more natural than many other anime films I've seen, and I did find most characters endearing, -I do give the movie credit for that-. But I had a very hard time understanding why did the writers decide to go in a different direction by the end of the film, the main idea was already solid and very clear, story had progressed in an intelligent manner. Nevertheless after all that, it's as if the film had an identity crisis, and didn't know what goal to pursue. The tone of the final act clearly attacks all of the previous achievements of the movie, it takes itself much too seriously, throwing in an additional half baked sci-fi plot, transforming the whole experience into a melodramatic, confuse and eventually meaningless mess. Needless to say, I was very disappointed.(and I did understand the movie, in case someone was wondering)However, I give it a 6/10, because of what it could have been, and what it does achieve halfway through the movie."
24,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,30 November 2009,"""Way Beyond 4 Stars!""","""The Girl Who Leapt Though time"" is my first favorite anime film to not be from Studio Ghibli. The look of the film is different from Studio Ghibli, but still considerably realistic. What I really like about this film is that it has a strong new message for everyone about how time travel can have consequences such as affecting people like close friends.When we lose something or do something stupid, all we want to do is go back into time and fix it, but even something like that can alternate the past in a bad way. My favorite scene is when Makato goes back through time to the moment when she discovers her time leap powers, it's a beautiful sequence with a beautiful song. I laughed throughout most of it and from the middle to the end, I nearly cried since I'm a guy, not a girl.Overall, this film is funny, intense, and heartwarming"
25,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,10 December 2008,Worth the wait,"I'd heard that this was a good film, that fan's of Studio Ghibli would enjoy, some time ago and looked forward to its DVD release, as the release date approached I was both looking forward to seeing it and a little worried in case it wouldn't live up to my expectations. I need not have worried as it was a lovely film with a good set of characters and a good story.The story follows the adventures of seventeen year old Makato who, following a fall in the science lab at school, discovers that she can leap back in time. She finds this out when she has an accident which should have killed her but instead of being hit by a train she finds herself a couple of minutes in the past and relatively unscathed. Once she learns how to repeat the feat she sets about making sure that instead of having a terrible day where everything goes wrong she has a great day instead; she isn't late for school, she knows all the answers in a surprise test and avoids an embarrassing accident in her cooking class. At first she doesn't realise that there are consequences to her actions but soon learns that when she makes things better for herself she may be making them worse for somebody else. Of course there is more to the story than that but I want to keep the spoilers to a minimum so as not to lessen the impact of the film.This is an utterly delightful film, the background animation is stunning and the character design is charming if not so detailed. Apart from one mildly rude comment, which is repeated due to a time leap, this would be suitable for all ages. Personally I suspect most children who were too young to hear the joke would be too young to understand it but as it was enough to earn the film a 12 Certificate from the BBFC I thought I should mention it.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles."
26,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,23 October 2009,An instant classic,"I would have to say that this film is probably my favorite anime Movie. But keep in mind that I watched this in Japanese with subtitles. English dubbing usually ruins anime for me. What I am most impressed about with this film is the characters. They are just so easy to love. Especially the main character, Makoto. Whether or not I like the main characters will often make it or break it for me and she passes with flying colors.I really gotta hand it to the screenplay writer. All the dialog seems so masterfully put together. The voice acting for the main characters (in the Japanese version) are also really great. Their combination allowed the subtle humor placed throughout the film work really well. Here are my ratings in categories with highest being 10.Plot: 9, an excellent and unique take on time travel. Screenplay: 10, done amazingly well with very believable dialogVisuals: 8, looks great but not the best Overall: 9All in all, I think that this anime film is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. It's great for all ages I definitely see it as a classic."
27,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,17 October 2008,A Ghibli film not made by Ghibli,"A shimmering hot sunny summer day, crickets happily chirping in the background, very bright green and blue colors, two guys and a girl playing some baseball, leasurely talking about life. Yups, Toki O Kakeru Shojo is that kind of film. Which is a little surprising, considering Hosoda's earlier efforts. Luckily, it turned out all for the better.Hosoda gathered a reputation when he elevated two mainstream series (Digimon and One Piece) to a slightly higher level through their movie spin-offs. Sadly, not enough to make them enjoyable. So I quickly lost track of Hosada and after having watched the original trailer of Toki, felt little incentive to renew my interest in his work.Still, when I came across Toki O Kakeru Shojo for a second time, I decided to watch it anyway. And I'm glad I finally did. Hosoda manages himself better with material that hasn't established itself yet. Toki is at heart a typical drama reminiscent of the films of Takahata or Hiroshi Ishikawa, enriched with some fantasy elements, bringing him closer to the work of M. Shinkai. And while his talent doesn't match that of any of the names mentioned above, it would be unfair to call Hosoda second-rate or light-weight.Toki O Kakeru Shojo takes a lighter approach to its romantic theme, mixing in a timid sci-fi perspective. Though the whole time leaping business might sound important, in reality it's just a simple means to put some accents on certain parts of the storyline. It does bring a nice twist to the film, which could otherwise have slipped rather anonymously between a long list of Japanese dramas (animated or not).Visually, Hosoda's style is somewhat acquired. There's a distinct lack of detail in the character designs and the coloring is kept simple as well. Still, it works for the slender, realistic looking characters, especially when you see them animated. The lack of detail allows the characters to assume some more realistic movements. The backgrounds on the other hand are often very detailed and rather lush to look at.The soundtrack is simple but effective, largely consisting of music that creates a soothing atmosphere without being too noticeable. There are a few times where the music is a little over-the-top, but in general there's enough cricket-chirping and soft piano music to put you right at ease.To keep with the lighter atmosphere, Hosoda leaves room for several comedic scenes which blend in well with the rest of the film. By doing this, he makes sure the film never becomes too depressing or hard to swallow. The sci-fi elements remain simple but effective throughout the film and help to keep the film entertaining, leaving the viewer in a constant chilled atmosphere.Toki O Kakeru Shojo is at heart a very simple romantic drama, with a few additions to keep it interesting to the seasoned fan. If you're in the mood for action or lots of plot twists, there's little here for you. But if you're up for a little variation on the Ghibli magic, this film might be a pretty good bet to make. It's not up there with the best, but Hosoda isn't far behind either. 4.5*/5.0*"
28,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,4,20 December 2016,"Sorry Everybody, But This Movie is One Big Slow Plot Hole.","Super-Minor Spoilers (in the form of the synopsis you can just read on the box of the DVD, so nothing obvious)Here Goes:The film itself is aesthetically pleasing and the voice acting is spot on, but that is about as far as this film goes regarding what it truly has to offer.The pacing starts off much too convoluted and quickly in order to get to the part where the protagonist can do the thing suggested in the title of the movie. Afterwards it slows down to a crawl in which the whole point of the story seems to be heavy on high school dating, which would be absolutely FINE in the realm of coming-of-age stories if it weren't for the fact that you really don't get an opportunity to feel pathos for any of the characters. There is so much potential there, but for the most-part there are no real dynamics within the interactions or relationships. Also, you get the strong vibe that if you say no to a boy when he asks you to date, you are too picky (just say yes to whomever demands it, I guess), so I don't see how this movie would also be good to show preteens/teens/children.This becomes another time-traveling movie where the protagonist has fun with their newfound ability at the beginning but then confronts consequences surrounding said fun, and there is nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately it is also a film where the character could have easily solved all of the problems that are beginning to form just by going back to the beginning and not messing around with anything.Also, the last 30 minutes of the film seem very phoned in. As if the writer looked back and said ""Huh, this really isn't going anywhere, let's see if we can just throw in some obvious tropes."" Just when you think it is all going to speed up and go somewhere, it really doesn't. Every action within this film just seems like a ploy to suck the viewer in with no real sense of finalized answers. Specific plot holes, and just blatantly overlooked explanations we would have liked to have known would have been nice to put in this review, but that would be hard to do without giving major spoilers. Trust me though, there are SO many holes and little things that a character could have simply done to solve this that, if you actually care about these kind of things in storytelling, would frustrate the heck out of you.Not recommended. It's OK, but nothing to write home about whatsoever. Definitely over-hyped."
29,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,,20 May 2015,Great and different time travel story,"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is the film that put director Mamoru Hosoda on the map and made him a household name in the anime circles. It's a time travel story, but with a very different take on the usual clichés. Here the time jumps are short, almost meaningless, and the traveler is not some young adult with a destiny or a world to save. Instead she's just a teenage girl.But it's that seeming normality of the story that makes it so special. Makoto (Riisa Naka) is an average girl, who likes to hang out with her friends and play baseball. She's not even all that bright. She's actually pretty dim, especially when you compare her to the usual heroines of cinema. So when she suddenly gains the gift to travel through time, you can bet that she's not going to be responsible about it. And that's where the film's charm and humour come from.It's also a good animated film on the technical side of things. Studio Madhouse has a distinct animation style that fits the story extremely well, being both fluid, expressive as well as rather urban, if that makes any sense. The voice acting is also flawless, the colours are bright and summery, the music sounds great and all in all it all simply works.If I had to nitpick, I'd say that the ending was not to my liking. Nothing wrong with it, really, but it shifted the tone rather abruptly, though not as much as to be jarring. Though I did like the explanation for the time travel, even if it seemed to have some plot holes. But then, time travels always have. It's pretty much inevitable.All in all this is a good film to check out for all anime fans. It has personality in spades and has an astonishingly good idea for a captivating story. Personally I do prefer Hosoda's Summer Wars to this, but it's a matter of opinion."
30,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,7 February 2015,Mamoro Hosoda's best film,"All three of his films that said, the other two being Summer Wars and Wolf Children, while neither without flaws(Summer Wars did have too many characters with some better-developed than others and Wolf Children had an at times rushed beginning and ended inconclusively) are great films and near-masterpieces almost as good as the best of Studio Ghibli.The Girl Who Leapt Through Time did get a little too complicated at the end and the character designs lacked the sophistication and detail of the rest of the animation. Speaking of the rest of the animation on the other hand, it's fantastic(something that all three of Hosoda's films have in common) with its luscious watercolour-like backgrounds and beautiful colours. The animation in the time-leaping is so inventive and effortlessly drawn it leaves one breathless. The film also has a great music score(another thing that all three Hosoda films had), it's positively hypnotic and sometimes rousing and sometimes melancholic, I also much appreciated the use of unobtrusive piano scoring.There is a thoughtful script that sounds remarkably natural(Japanese and American, dubs don't always translate well but it does fine here), complete with a deft balance of comedy and drama. The story is always engaging and not boring at all, it's funny, it's poignant, it's imaginative and it's thought-provoking, also using the time travel idea very effectively(one of the better films to do so). The messaging is well-handled and not laid on too thick. The characters are likable and interesting rather than being swamped by the time travel and the voice acting is good in the American dub(even if the title character's voice acting may be shrill for some, personally it wasn't a problem) and very good indeed in the Japanese version.Overall, a great film, near-masterpiece status in fact. If you loved The Girl Who Leapt Time and haven't seen Summer Wars or Wolf Children yet, do so. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
31,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,,24 December 2013,Tempus Fugit,"""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", a little masterpiece by Mamoru Hosoda, revolves around Makoto, a seventeen year old girl who spends her days lounging with Chiaki and Kosuke, her two best friends. Early in the film, Makoto discovered how to leap backward in time. Hosoda uses this newfound ability as a metaphor for the anxieties and dilemmas teenagers habitually face and seek to avoid.And so we watch as Makoto uses her powers to dodge responsibilities and glide through life. This, of course, eventually leads to unintended drawbacks. Pretty soon Makoto is setting off chain-reactions which demand her full attention. Her little temporal jaunts then make an unintended shift; they become a means of confronting adulthood rather than a means of prolonging adolescence.""Time waits for no one,"" a sign reads. Hosoda's film itself finds teenagers and adults facing a daunting smörgåsbord of choices and decisions. What's the right choice? What if I make a mistake? If time can't be reversed, how can I undo any potential future ""errors""? If we have little control, why choose at all? Why not stay protectively cocooned in infancy? Or bed!Eventually it is learnt that Chiaki is himself a time traveller. He's a kid from the future, running from his own problems and desperate for solutions. Specifically, he's in search of a painting. This painting, which depicts a young woman who radiates calmness amidst swirling chaos, becomes the film's metaphor for a kind of mental or philosophical state which Hosoda advocates: serenity and wisdom in the face of turmoil. Repeated cutaway shots to a cloud cluster, huge, tranquil and looming almost preternaturally over a canvas of confusion, epitomises this state of mind. It is also hinted that Makoto's aunt, a woman who works in an art gallery and restores paintings, is herself Makoto in or from the future (the film's source material makes it clear that they aren't the same character). She works alongside a painting which Makoto will one day preserve, the very painting which will hopefully help Chiaki find peace and strength within his own, original time-line.Ignoring the film's temporal shenanigans, and its fetish-like obsession with ultra short skirts, ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" works well as a romantic drama. When our cast are not cutting their way through much sexual tension, they're goofing off, playing baseball or trying to reconcile both long term planning and the unexpected whims of the heart. The film ends with Makoto promising to meet Chiaki in the future. Hosoda's bittersweet theme song suggests that this liaison never occurs.8.5/10 - See Hosoda's ""Summer Wars""."
32,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,5 September 2013,"Excellent, although somewhat puzzling","This terrific fantasy focuses on a girl who discovers she can jump back in time, and much of the movie is a light-hearted exploration of what a teenage girl would do with that power, which is essentially relive life better, avoid uncomfortable conversations, and eat pudding. The lead character is likably average.There are a few oddities in this movie. Some of them are because it turns out, as I learned at wikipedia, that this isn't actually the same story as the novel upon which it is based but a sequel containing a character from the original movie, which explains a lot. Apparently the original story has been made into several movies and TV series in Japan, so the assumption was probably that everyone would understand a lot of references I didn't get.Also, towards the end, we are given little pieces of information that suggest there is a whole other story to learn, although whether that story is in the original book or whether that would be the subject of yet another narrative I don't know.Then there's the ending, which is logically unsatisfying and yet which I ultimately found emotionally resonant. It's one of these puzzling endings that has you reading wikipedia and going through the IMDb forum posts (which offer a lot of fascinating theories).Well worth watching."
33,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,14 January 2013,Time waits for no one.,"With Christmas only being 2 weeks away,I started to think about what movie I could pick up for a friend who is a big fan of animated films.Having recently introduced her to Hayao Miyazaki's tremendous 1997 film Princess Mononoke,I felt that it would be a good idea to take a slight division from Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli,by taking a look at the work that regular Ghibli Art Director Nizo Yamamoto had done with Mamoru Hosoda,which would also give me the exciting chance,of witnessing someone leaping through time.The plot:Taking a pile of pop-quiz school papers up to the rarely visited top floor of the building,student Makoto Konnon is shocked to find the floor completely deserted.Looking round the disused rooms,Makoto notices that someone has written on a chalkboard in a laboratory room ""Time waits for no one"".Hearing a sudden sound,Konnon trips over an object on the floor,and starts to fall to the ground.Expecting to crash to the ground,Makoto instead enters a time continuum,that takes her a few seconds back in time.Being unable to completely understand the event which has taken place,Konnon at first, goes back to spending time playing catch with her close friends Chiaki Mamiya and Kousuke Tsuda, until a near fatal accident leads to Makoto seeing time flash,and leap,before her very eyes.View on the film:Taking a different route from the traditional path of time travelling films,where the event that the character has to sort out involves accidentally creating some sort of dystopia future,this adaptation of Yasutaka Tsutsui's novel by Satoko Okudera instead takes a strongly down to earth approach,which allows for the film to be focus on the intimate relationship between the three main characters,instead of needlessly getting tangled up by any useless exposition.Keeping the movie limited to a handful of characters,Okudera makes each of the three friends people who are distinctive and easily identifiable to any viewer of the film.From Mamiya trying to gather up the courage to ask the first girl he has ever fancied out,Tsuda trying to make the most of the opportunity's that are available to him,whilst also making sure to keep a grip on his friends in the ""past"",and Makoto,initially seeing time travel as a similar activity to the games that she plays with her friends,until a sudden defeat at this particular ""game"" leads to Makoto having to enter the adult world to sort out her troubles.Going in a similar direction for the time travel aspect of the story,Okudera decision to keep the travelling aspect grounded,allows for the sudden sharp twist in Mokoto's time travelling fun to strongly resonate with the viewer,due to the movie having allowed the viewer to see the fun time travelling adventures through Mokoto's eyes,which allows the viewer to have the same feeling of hopelessness as Mokoto has,when she discovers the very negative effects of her gift.With previously having been the director of a Pokemon type of TV show/movie called Digimon,director Mamoru Hosoda shows an astonishing progression from his kid friendly past by making an elegant,stylish film that most ""live action"" directors could only dream of.Showing a clear influence of Studio Ghibil's Japanamation and also backed by a strong English dub, Hosoda brilliantly uses light and the side of frames to create a slightly supernatural sense of mystery,as events which Hosoda had subtly put at the side of the film, (such as a weird noise that Mokoto only hears for a few short moments before her travelling begins) turn out to be the main key for Mokoto to sort out the troubling events which have taken place.Allowing the viewer to jump head first with Mokoto in the moments through time,Hosoda expertly contrasts the smoothly drawn earth sections of the film by giving the time travelling a rough and warming sketch feel that's covered in 1000's of whirling pencil lines,which leads to the viewer wanting to leap back in time with Mokoto again and again."
34,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,,22 August 2012,Filled with charming human moments,"Based on Yasutaka Tsutsui's 1967 novel, - which has been adapted several times over the years, including 1983's The Little Girl Who Conquered Time - The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a charming mix of drama and romantic comedy, with a slight infusion of science fiction ideas. Makoto (Riisa Naka) is a high school girl who, through serendipity, gains the ability to leap back in time (but she only manages moments or hours back). She has platonic relationships with two high school boys, Chiaki (Takuya Ishida) and Kousuke (Mitsutaka Itakura), and they spend their time playing baseball.With her new-found abilities, she does nothing spectacularly profound, and the films intentions aren't to comment on paradoxes or to shift the space-time continuum as is usually the case with time travel narratives. Makoto uses her abilities to repeat events that pleasure her, to ace a school test, and also to avoid certain embarrassing situations with her friends. But as her relationships with, particularly, Chiaki and Kousuke, her leaps become more personally profound, as she attempts to possibly save the people she cares for (within the context of small human moments of danger, and not the usual global/country catastrophes.I love the fact that in Japan, they do not distinguish between live- action cinema and animated (anime if you like) films, they are all simply movies. Now I'm going to contradict this with a Western perspective: This beautifully animated film is a delight to view, with its traditional two-dimensions, it is evidence to the west that 3D, computer generated animation is not the overbearing format, and 2D is still a genuinely viable medium. The film is filled with charming human moments, both touching and thoughtful. Teenage comedies rarely have this level of tenderness of character, that also explores concepts of fate, the passage of time and the intricacies of small human moments, and the delicate nature of human relationships.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
35,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,28 February 2011,"Takes ""Playing God"" to a New Level","(This review discusses the English dub, so don't read if you hate dubs.)Makoto Konno is your typical teenager: careless, athletic, a social butterfly and a girl who just manages to get by in both school and life. One day, however, things take a turn for the worse: after running late for school, flunking a test and getting into a series of accidents, Makoto's bike jams on the way to her aunt and causes her to run head-on with a train, a normally-fatal incident which she-miraculously-comes out of alive. Confused, her aunt informs her that she's experienced a phenomenon called ""time leaping,"" a gift, she claims, most girls her age possess at some point in time. Makoto then uses this gift to her own advantage, not realizing that her pleasure is causing those close to her to suffer.Having just watched this movie for the first time, I was surprised how well it was able to take ideas that'd been done before in prior movies (such as Groundhog Day, The Matrix, a Nolan mindf*** movie like Memento and the incredibly-underrated Bruce Almighty) and add enough originality to make it seem new. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time may just be your typical coming-of-age story on the surface, but it's done in a way that males, especially adult males, will get something out of it too. It's got its humour (such as when Makoto tries to leap out her bedroom window and her sister perceives it as attempted-suicide,) its dark moments (such as when Makoto shouts in fear as one of her best-friends and his girlfriend get hit by a train) and its slapstick comedy, all wrapped in a fun package. But where the movie really shines is in its overlying theme of regret when facing the past: far too often we regret the mistakes we've made and wish we could reverse them, but sometimes it's for the best that we can't; besides, even if we COULD change them, would we be satisfied with our revisions?Aside from the beautiful animation and interesting characters, it's also important to take note of the voice-acting. While I know nothing about the original Japanese, at the same time I think the English dub deserves its fair share of credit. It seems that, far too often these days, people snub dubs under the pretext that they butcher what makes the original voice work so special, not stopping to respect the effort that goes into the dubs so that people who can't understand Japanese and/or have trouble with subtitles can appreciate what's being offered. To that end, the English cast is fantastic. I especially have to applaud Emily Hirst, who easily steals the show as Makoto and is a sheer joy to listen to. I also have to applaud her for her very convincing crying moments, as those are very hard for voice actors to do in animated movies. Not only were they well-timed, but they sounded authentic to the point where I can easily see a real person take her place.In the end, this is just another must-see for animation and movie fans. Far too often in the world of anime, directors associate mature with man's insatiable lust for pootytang. With that line of thinking, we often end up with anime movies and shows that are disgusting to both watch and visualize in our mind. To that end, I'm glad that The Girl Who Leapt Through Time doesn't go for such filth, instead challenging our minds and getting us to think about life in general. The film isn't perfect, there were a few parts that got a little grinding to watch, but that doesn't make it any less of a masterpiece. I can't recommend it more.Final Score: 9/10."
36,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,12 April 2010,Awesome edition!,"I am not keen to like movies like these, mostly because they are animated, don't get me wrong they might be great and grown up like but sometimes they lose face for me. That's also why I will always get surprised when I see something like this. Story 9/10 - The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is about a girl who suddenly gets to stop time, however she is affected by a counter on her hand, which she doesn't get at first, her friends consist of two boys and a girl, probably more than that but mostly about three people, these three friends are, Kousuke Tsuda, Yuri Hayakawa, Chiaki Mamiya. The movie is mostly about events up to a certain plot line that will blow your mind, it isn't that huge at all but it still will make you twitch and wonder. When she gets this power she uses it for selfness needs, changing many outcomes including the many times that Kousuke Tsuda asks her out on a date, In the end however she slowly loses more and more chances to change the future ending up with an outcome she certainly didn't want, I am not going to tell you what the outcome was or what it involves I am just going to say that you should defiantly see this movie for its story if not for anything else. Actor - 9/10 Likable Characters from start to finish, normally the voice acting for something like this is screwed up, sometimes they choose the wrong voice actors to do something like this, but in this movie they didn't, I have seen it in Japanese and in English, and I can say that both are great, the English voice cast does a great effort to bring the characters to life, it is like they wanted to act good in this movie and I like that fact. Also it should be mentioned that even though that there aren't any famous people acting the voice, I wouldn't say that there is but they feel like they would be in my opinion they are just as great as say some of the greatest actors of our time. Music 10/10 - I was surprised to hear the two songs, and especially the inserted song, normally when they sing somewhere in the movie it is sometimes ruined, not as well but sometimes it is just not that perfectly done at all and you feel left alone really. Hanako does those two songs the justice they really need, if it was just for the story it would be okay but the music does a lot to create an even more exhilarating experience, I feel like they couldn't have done it without her at all, great song, great voice, just great music, it really needs to be point out. Animation 8/10 - It is computer animation as I see it, that's not something that I hate at all, but it does prove that it could've been done more awesome with real hand to hand drawn images but then again somewhere probably hand drawn so I can't say anything against that at all anyways. Overall 9/10 - The story is great, music great, actors great, the animation could've been better but then again it was drawn to perfection in my opinion it is like they really wanted this to work, I would say buy it and keep it, store it away and one day in the near future and even in the far future see it again, I am sure it will work for you even the second, the third time, it is great and I say love it!"
37,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,7 November 2008,another top notch anime film and you will see why,"this film in my opinion is great because its had every element of romance, it really was not cliché, but the plot is great even though its not to the book it truly is a modern version which stands out to our time and i recommend it to any one. Yes it does make you cry and yes is its not one of those anime's you can gun to the bone because its just stays true to the genre its was made to be and in that hand i have to admit its the one of the best in its genre. the downs is if your type isn't romance then don't watch it simple but for any person that does it will sureley strike a chord especially the main character, she's really a gem. WATCH IT !!!"
38,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,,9 March 2009,Enjoyable animation with a twist to it that doesn't affect the core values of the film,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this animated film when it was given to me  I can't even remember the discussion/messages that led another user to post this to me (sorry) as it took me a while to get around to watching it. The film starts out with a bit of a comic air to Makoto's jumping through time; mostly she is addressing minor issues or mistakes that she makes rather than anything more significant than that. After a while though the film starts to move towards more of the emotional core of the story and becomes somewhat of a coming-of-age tale, albeit with low-distance time travel involved. This in turn develops into quite a touching (if not totally clear) set of events that end the film and provided quite a warming conclusion. Contrary to some reviewers here, I do not think the film is perfect or that the writing is brilliant but I will admit that it was cleverly written. The thing that appealed to me about it was that, even as it was about time-travel, it kept the heart and reality of the characters close to hand  it didn't become Jumper with global action sequences, rather it maintained the focus on Makoto and her relationships. Her newfound ability didn't change who she was or what she felt  just gave her new perspectives and opportunities, which the film uses within this context to good effect.The animation is typical in feel for the country of origin but is still impressive. It is more ""normal"" than some may expect but the style is cool and the back and foregrounds are all convincing. Although fans of the genre may be used to more in the way of excess, this is still a good-looking film and the effects and imaginative touches it has are mostly used to enhance the story telling rather than just being for the sake of it. The characters are well-drawn in animation terms but in terms of development the main job is done on Makoto. Visually she is cute and appealing, with emotions clear on her but also in the script and performance (by Naka) she is made a real character and is a real part of keeping the heart in the film. The rest of the characters are very much supporting but they are also good from the other actors.I enjoyed this film. Personally I didn't think that it did enough of any one thing well enough to justify the flawless reviews and votes from some of my peers here, but this is not to say that it is still not very good. The sci-fi element never overshadows the heart of the characters and it remains a coming-of-age story even as the leaps and jumps get more convoluted  and it is this core that makes it as engaging as it is."
39,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,4,15 January 2010,for a younger age group or people who don't like to think too much and just want some eye candy,"I seriously don't think that this movie deserves an overall rating of 8/10 (average), compared to the movie which in terms of storyline and theory it would have been going for in my opinion, the Butterfly Effect. Though keep in mind, this is coming from someone who expects a lot out of movies that are acclaimed... (an 8/10 on IMDb is decent, though Butterfly Effect has ~100k votes as opposed to around 4-5k votes on this movie) Sure, the movie has great eye candy and is nicely animated. But the characters are deliberately made to be very dim-witted and it's obvious to someone like myself, or someone who's mature enough to tell. The way the characters are so flawed (seemingly deliberately, just to fill a plot that can't fill itself if you know what I mean) remind me so much of how characters from like, 7th Heaven (the American TV show with a bajillion adopted kids in a family). I feel that this is a way for writers to cut corners -- just give the movie some sort of scaffolding just to give the animators something to animate. I can go on and on about the things that really bugged me about the storyline, the characters... lots of the dialogue felt way too much like extremely artificial, meaningless filler to me. The way Makoto was thinking after Chiaki made his confession was very irrational and stupid... and she never really sat down to think and just leaped through time whenever she felt like it, even if in the end she leaped for Chiaki... it just feels like the characters never learned anything fundamental. even after exploring that aspect, there are many other issues brought up that makes this movie so incredibly incomplete as a story -- deliberately vague just to desperately fill up a storyline, like cheating on a long term paper in order to make your essay an extra page long by increasing the font size of the period at the end of a paragraph or something. Very nice animation, but very disappointing story... I only watched this movie because a friend asked me to. Lately I've been kind of avoiding anime because I expect way too much out of story lines, dialogues, character development and just... everything that makes you think and question. if makoto made an entry on fmylife.com during the middle of the movie, I feel that most people would have voted ""you totally deserved it."" if most people voted ""I agree, your life sucks"" then it probably would have been because of her aunt who just never told her the right stuff (again, just for the sake of driving the storyline someplace...) Good for a younger age group and eye-candy or if you want to just sit back and not think too much -- don't watch it if you expect something remotely profound, witty, smart or innovative out of the storyline."
40,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,25 June 2012,It will make you wish you could leap!,"Being a huge fan of Japanese anime movies I try to watch every new position that becomes available on the American market right away. I bought the DVD with English subtitles in a nearby store, and felt like a little child once again, being so absorbed by the fantastic animation that appeared on my TV screen.Mamoru Hosoda, known mostly for work in the Digimon series, created a really beautiful picture, which would appeal to everyone, no matter what age. The story is based on a book of the same name. It shows the bizarre, and sometimes complicated, adventures of a girl named Makoto, who one day realizes that she is able to leap through time. Like every normal teenage girl would probably do, she starts to take advantage of that uncanny, and basically random, gift. Whether it's a class test, or a boy-related problem, she can easily omit the difficult circumstances by leaping back in time and changing the whole situation to be just as she wanted. On one horrible occasion she even saved herself from a certain death. I believe that up to this moment anyone would want to have that kind of power.However, not everything can go as smoothly as one can imagine. Makoto starts to understand that her frequent, and mostly unnecessary, time alterations cause harm to others, including her dearest friends, Chiaki and Kosuke. She is not only distancing herself from them, but also putting one of the boys in grave danger. Surprisingly enough, in one tragic moment, Chiaki confesses that he is the one responsible for her newborn ability. Then Makoto starts to regret her superfluous outbursts, which caused more pain than happiness actually. After all the events she even recognizes her true feelings and knows that she made a mistake by rejecting Chiaki's offer for a date.I must say that the story really caught me right from the start, as it presents an instructive take on the matters of time travels. It's hard to find another anime, which shows this particular topic in such a convincing, and enjoyable way. While the detailed and colorful animation is on the highest level, with every character drawn to perfection, it sometimes feels as though one is watching a feature film. Great voice-over makes it that much easier to grasp the full potential of the characters' personalities.It's only a shame that it wasn't advertised on a bigger scale, as it might have been as big as Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle once were. I recommend it to every anime fan out there, as it's one of the most splendid and pleasurable animations of 2006."
41,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,,8 January 2012,Wonderful,"In this (non Studio Ghibli) animated movie set in contemporary Japan, Makoto is in her last year of high school. She is a typical high school girl standing on the edge of adulthood - bright, gawky, clumsy, sociable, unsure of herself, looking forward to further education, not really into boys yet (or not that she would let on, anyway). We see a picture of this likable young woman's life, from always being nearly late on her way to school, to her younger sister eating the pudding she had saved, to life at school, to playing baseball each afternoon on her way home with her two contemporary male pals Chiaki and Kousuke. Then an accident happens and Makoto discovers that she is able to (literally) leap backwards in time. At first, she uses this ability to improve small things in her own and her friends' lives - maths test scores and the like - but then she discovers that there are more important implications.This film - which treats the time travel consequences with respect while never offering an explanation as to how or why - is actually about how the big issues which affect ordinary people are actually all small things - even love, the biggest thing of all.The development of this story is always pleasing and interesting and, at the end, very moving. Without giving anything away, the ending is bittersweet, entirely fair, very sad and full of hope, completely unexpected, and had me (60 year old English man) crying like a baby.The animation, while not enormously sophisticated, is perfectly suited to the material, the backgrounds are atmospheric and attractive, and the film works beautifully. My only criticism is that Makoto's US voice characterisation is somewhat shrill, but I will try again with the Japanese audio and subtitles.Recommended."
42,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,4,7 May 2017,"Visually stunning, but lacks cohesion overall","The visuals are second to none for an anime. The amount of work, the attention to details, the color spectrum used in this anime are absolutely mesmerizing, a real tribute to and a reminder of the seemingly endless finesse of Japanese art. Alas, I have found the narrative and the story line too lightly treated to provide the sense of cohesion which would have made it a true masterpiece. Too many flashbacks, not enough time for the viewer to properly handle the various aspects of a given action development... But like I said earlier, the visuals are a real sight to see."
43,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,1 May 2017,I Love This!,"This is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen that depicts time traveling. The movie may have some comedic scenes here and there, but don't be fooled...this movie is also very emotional especially at the end, which I won't spoil for you if you have yet to see it. Both the animation and the music are so artistically beautiful. Woven into the movie's story is theme of romance, which I'm not usually a fan of, but the theme actually works after watching it for the first time.If you are an anime fan or if you're trying to get into anime, you should watch this movie. Don't overlook it. It's amazing!"
44,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,6,19 March 2017,Playing with time,"Makoto is your average Japanese high school girl, enjoying her life, going to class, having her friends... till, for unexplained reasons, she gains the power to travel through time (well, to jump, literally, back in time). Happy with the knowledge she will use to her own benefit. But this will have unexpected consequences...""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is an entertaining story, with good animation, funny humor and cool characters, that only fails a little bit in the pace and strength of the story, the first coming and going, and the second a little bit all over the place. It is difficult to justify time-travel, but the movie just ignores any kind of science or similar, and goes for Makoto using it to pass her math exam or trying to get a couple of friends together. It makes for funny moments, and the tone helps in making it all enjoyable, every time she travels in time her actions having unexpected and, sometimes funny, consequences. The last part, though, is a little bit weak, with a strange and unexpected twist. Fans of anime will enjoy it, though."
45,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,19 September 2016,A very well written drama,"Honestly, I have only seen this film twice in my life. I first watched it in 2012 and then later this year. The plot holds up very well over time as it does not rely on animation trick, gimmicks, or tries to do anything more than what I perceive it should.It's about a girl who was going to die because she was being negligent in her life, and through circumstances learns that she can jump through time.What I really liked about this film is that even though the person had super powers, it was more of a curse as life as more of an ebb and flow to it. So taking what seems as a good opportunity might take away something that could have been even better.The animation on the piece was really good for the time; there are clearly sections where dialogue was more important than the animation so they did cut back in quality during those times. But it does not get in the way at all and there are some scenes that are ageless.This is a very heart-full movie and not to be cliché, but I am a man that typically does not cry and this movie has managed to get me to cry both times I watched it, as it is a really well scripted movie."
46,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,6,26 July 2016,youthful time leap story,"The main character is a high school girl named Makoto. She get ability of time slip. She use this ability for her personal things. Though she thinks no one know her time travel, Chiaki who is Makoto's friends becomes aware. This is the story of Makoto's development through time leap.Comical story development and tempo makes film fresh. However, Makoto's using time leap is too trifling and there are unreasonableness and contradiction of time leap. Therefore, some feel some dissatisfaction, I think.This animation movie has the 10th anniversary since release. Now, Toki kake café opens for a limited period, so there are deep-rooted fans. I like Makoto's freshness and energy. Makoto's voice is not only cheerful but also silly, so I was pleased. This film give me positive feeling."
47,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,22 July 2016,I like it so much,This is Japanese animation film. A girl has ability to leap time and she back in time to change the past. Kazuko is a high school student girl. She has ability to leap time. She comes to use the ability when she wants it. So she backs in time to save people with the ability. Her friends Kazuo and Goro do not believe her story. One day she know Kazuo's secret and she has to make miserable decision.I love this story. Kazuko is very tough to do. The ending is not happy but I feel something warm in it. Leaping time is scientific but there is love term. I am sure you enjoy this film.
48,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,22 March 2016,A Film to be Embraced,"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is not the best animated movie ever made, or even the best time travel movie ever made. But it is amazing, enrapturing, and one of the best animated movies of this century.It centers around a teenage girl named Makoto Konno and her two friends, Kousuke Tsuda and Chiaki Mamiya, the latter of which has a crush of her. The three of them play baseball in the park every day after school. Makoto has had a bad day, making all sorts of stupid mistakes and even falling onto a small walnut-shaped item in her chemistry room. But none of that compares to what happens next: while riding her bike on her way to see her aunt, the train passes through the street. She tries to stop in time to avoid it, but she is hit, dying. But then she wakes up where she was five minutes ago. She has gone back in time.I was immediately drawn in.This films is fascinating on so many levels. It never goes quite where you expect it to go. It is not deliberately subversive, but it is clear that is telling its own story, using tropes and clichés instead of falling back on them. The twist they throw in at the halfway mark is clever and smart, and it really adds to the experience, making the movie as a whole even more rewarding than it otherwise would have been.To call the direction inventive would be an understatement. Every artistic decision is the right one. For example, look back at the title of the film. That is not metaphorical. Makoto literally leaps through time. Her powers activate because she flies through the air upon being hit, and whenever she wants to jump through time, she has to jump from high up. When she arrives at her new temporal destination, she is on the ground, rolling. That is so smart and innovative. Time travel as an idea has been around for hundreds of years, and it has been done to death. To bring something new and different to the equation is difficult, if not impossible. But Hosoda managed to pull it off.This is very much a high school supernatural drama. There is everything from teenage awkwardness to teenage indecisiveness to teenage anxiety. But it is done well. I felt like I was seeing the first teenage drama ever made. There is a sense of energy to every second of the film. Things like seeing someone trip and fall were ten times funnier than they otherwise would be thanks to the time and effort put in my the animation team. Animation allows for more energetic expression, something this movie takes full advantage of without making it seem like too much.Makoto is the highlight of the film. The animation on her is fluid and sharp and hyper, and the English dub voice actor does a great job of matching it. She captures every scene of the film. It's enough to almost make me wish there was no time travel element, and the whole story was just her journey through high school.Hasodo's first major project was directing the first two Digimon movies (or, if you're a Westerner, the first two-thirds of the Digimon movie). I was surprised by this, but it makes sense. Those movies were way better than they should have been thanks to two things: one, its ability to make it's human characters interesting to watch and listen to even when they're not doing much; and two, its ability to make a low budget sing. Those two elements are apparent here. Not a lot of extraordinary, jaw-dropping things happen- except in the middle third- but the feel of the movie, that of a hot, past-its-prime summer day, more than makes up for it.As for the 'low-budget' thing: this film has far more money than any of the Digimon movies, but it did not have enough money to go for the big guns on every shot, like a Miyazaki movie could. There is an almost tangible desire of this film to conserve the money for the spectacular shots. And there are a lot spectacular shots. The animation of her going through time is a showstopper. It's like she's traveling through a giant watch.All in all, it feels somewhat like the animated equivalent of an artsy indie movie. There are all the ingredients: young, brilliant director, low budget, adding new twists to old mechanics. It's a unique experience.But that does not mean it does not remind me of things. The first thing that came to mind was the fantastic episodic video game Life is Strange. Some elements of that were clearly lifted from this and given a hipstery, sepia-toned makeover. But as it war on, it started to remind me of a mix of Inception and Run Lola Run. Obviously, the tone is different, but it has a quality of etherealness and visual inventiveness that reminds me of the former and a quality of experimentation and videogameiness that reminds me of the latter.There are a few things that stop this movie from measuring up to the great Miyazaki films. Though the pacing is almost absurdly good, it still doesn't give off as much narrative heft as it wants to. And while there are no characters I find unbearable, I wish the other characters were as interesting to watch as Makoto. But these are minor gripes. This is the sort of film you feel bad for not giving a perfect score. It's powerful, evocative, and innovative. These are the kind of films we need more of. Hosoda may be no Miyazaki, but with luck, he could usurp Miyazaki's crown. If that happens- and it looks like it is- the future of Japanese animation looks bright."
49,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,13 September 2014,True Girl,"This film is awesome it has so good visual effect and the animation. it has also have pretty sweet story and the acting of character is also so good. it is the story of a middle life girl how she face problem and how she react it is just amazing. the girl cry, smile, anger and sadness everything is show in film you just have to pay attention to the detail and also have some fantasy element like like time traveling which make the film awesome and also everyone dream of it but it truly tell if we have this power we cannot make a great change in our time and it has also some price so i recommend you to watch this film is good. 1000 time better than American stupid film and show a true nature of girl and this film also won the 2007 Japaneses academy award for best animation"
50,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,28 February 2014,Time travel at its best,"No, I wasn't always charmed by the way of animation. Sometimes it was a bit childish, and the far open mouth at emotions was even disturbing sometimes. Yet at the end of the movie I was sitting straight up. The story line was fascinating. Beside the troubles time traveling brings when you try to alter the past, also the emotional development of Makoto as consequence of the changes and her relation with her friends are important I particularly liked the guidance of auntie witch, of who you wonder maybe did have a similar experience in the past. And the end you see Makoto develop in a way to become like her. Fascinating movie and can recommend to all"
51,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,24 February 2014,Incredible Movie,"This is quite possibly my favourite movie of all time, which if you know me, is saying something. The Storyline itself, although not what I expected, was simply amazing.(at the risk of sounding lame...) I went into this movie expecting a sci-fi anime adventure but it turned out to be one of the only movies that have ever made me truly feel.I kept putting off watching this for quite some time, but if I had the power to 'time leap' then I would go back and watch it straight away.truly this deserves 10 stars if not more. And to me, will be forever an incredible movie which I would gladly tell anyone to watch without a moments hesitation."
52,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,7,30 January 2014,Very Cathartic Watch,"I highly recommend the movie for anime watchers. The characters Makoto, Chiaki, and Kosuke bring the viewers into a interesting, yet mundane life of high school. Makoto begins to experience leaping through time and as she does she journeys to find out more about herself and true love. All this to say the movie is a therapeutic and cathartic watch, especially with music from Kiyoshi Yoshida (II) (also worked on Sonic the Hedgehog). I like movies like this that bring you into atmosphere of peace. The plot is thorough unlike some anime and although there is minor action and no real fight sciences it's a successful modern piece of anime. Enjoy, the film.I enjoyed Mamoru Hosoda work in Samuai Champloo, and look forward to watching Wolfe Children and Summer Wars.I think the art in the films is scenic and serene, and though less dazzling than other films still has beauty of it's own. Other films that I would consider as therapeutic watches are Secret World of Arietty by Hayao Miyazaki, and maybe one with a little more action would be Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. I enjoyed Mamoru Hosoda work in Samuai Champloo, and look forward to watching Wolfe Children and Summer Wars."
53,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,21 November 2013,This is time-travel done correctly.,"Finally a time-travel story that isn't bogged down with paradoxes and inconsistencies. Those usually bug the crap out of me when I see things from the genre. (Doctor Who, Stein's;Gate and Bioshock Infinite are all notable examples of stories that fail) *very minor spoiler* The fact that they only travel into the body of their past self is what eliminates most of the problems. But even then, they don't focus as much on the traversal of time as other stories do (and fail). The only problems with the traveling is the ""teleportation"" they do. Like her moving instantly from one place to another. Along with her transferal of momentum to her previous self. Those make no sense, but they're not given much focus either, so I can forgive those faults. *end spoiler*The entire story is an obvious labor of love. So much detail has been put into the characters and which parts of the story you are being shown. The movie never feels like it's wasting your time. Only towards the end did I feel like they were dragging a bit. I loved the big twist. It was done really cleverly.I also wasn't impressed with the voice acting, nor sound effects. The main character sounded really fake when she was laughing and crying. Really fake. It bugged the crap out of me. She was good outside of those moments though. As for the scenes, they just often didn't have the atmospheric sounds they would have in real life, which made the scenes feel more fake. The voice acting and lack of atmosphere are probably why I wasn't too impressed with the final ""goodbye"", which I will not go into detail about to avoid spoiling anything.Overall I would recommend this movie to anybody, as it achieves greatness in almost every single aspect."
54,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,28 July 2013,"Nice blend of humor, drama, and romance","Long story short: The animation, voice acting, and story made The Girl Who Leapt Through Time a fun ride to experience.The whole film was unpredictable. The summary of 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time' goes that a 17- year-old high school student named Konno Makoto gains the ability to travel back in time and the length goes according to how far she jumps. She soon realizes that her actions greatly affect the lives of those around her and tries to make things right. That was all I knew would happen and I do not mind one single bit. I don't know what else to say except that the parts where the audience is supposed to laugh is when I laugh, the parts that were dramatic made me gasp, and the relationships between the characters were cute and fun. Although this review is short, it's all I could come up with at this moment in time so unless I gain the power to travel back in time, I'm good here."
55,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,10 May 2013,A beautiful Anime,"""Time Waits For No One""A very entertaining high school anime romance, which just happens to include time travel. The story follows Makoto Konno a young girl who falls over a weird walnut looking object and after a near death experience. discovers she can time jump, which she then abuses this power frivolously. You have to love the way Makoto uses her power as any teenager would, to pass exams, avoids awkward situations, and relives fun moments over and over. Giving her character and other characters a quite realistic credibility. The film is also wonderfully animated with beautiful colours, and stunningly unique scenery. The film does however slow down a lot in the final third in it's desperation to wrap everything up, and try to explain any plot elements that may need more explaining. A wonderfully compelling story, and reminds me of some of my favorite aspects of anime. In it's good natured sweetness."
56,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,2 December 2012,"Funny, imaginative and heartfelt","The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a wonderful film. It has a wildly imaginative yet simple story backed up by believable characters and good animation.The story is universally relatable: who hasn't thought about what they would do if they could travel through time? The film successfully illustrates the consequences of tampering with something one doesn't fully understand and ultimately shows that things aren't always perfect, no matter what you do. As the main character's time leaps start to cause unwanted consequences you truly feel for her as she tries to do everything right.The characters truly make the world come to life: the protagonist is instantly likable as a bit of a klutz, and her sometimes erratic behavior provides some great comedy. The other characters are completely believable and relatable as well. The depiction of the friendship between the three main characters at the beginning feels incredibly real and natural. It's hard to not care for them.The voice acting and animation aren't bad either. The character animation is particularly smooth and pleasing to the eye. The characters convey loads of personality through just the way they move and act. The voice acting is great, and brings a great deal of emotion to the characters.In summation I can hardly find any major criticisms for this movie. It won't blow your mind, but it's a genuinely touching and heartfelt film.Recommendation: Absolutely worth seeing. If you're trying to get friends into anime, this is the film to go."
57,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,10,6 August 2012,second film should be there,"I love the movie and all but why doesn't it haven't a second film because Chiaki Mamiya says at the end ""I'll see you in the future,"" and i think there should be a second film to the first because of that. In my opinion i think there should be a 'the girl who leapt through time 2' if you can make another film of the girl who leapt through time that would be amazing and i think a lot of people would like to watch it if they liked the first one they would most probably like the second if you did one i really want there to be a 'the girl who leapt through time 2' or a different title for it whatever but i really want there to be another one............"
58,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,24 December 2008,Young Japanese school girl finds that time travel is a dangerous thing,"On the face of it this is a sci-fi or fantasy movie, but actually it's a gentle coming of age story. The time travel chaos mimics the rites of passage and angst of this emotionally immature girl as she travels to a more adult viewpoint with regard to relationships. Though the pace of the film is uneven, the plot very simple and character development sketchy, it nonetheless has great charm.Beautifully drawn & animated, gently paced, it is universal in its theme and a delight to watch for the first time. Even the casual viewer will be pulled along if only to see how the time travel confusion works itself out!"
59,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,11 July 2007,"Beautiful film, but not great","It's way above average and it has it all: animation, storyline, voice acting. I haven't noticed the soundtrack, but it wasn't bad. But that's about it. If you come with a Western point of view, this movie is way above everything you've seen, but compared to many Japanese anime, it's slightly above average. Of course, it is an average computed on watchable animes, yes?Anyway, the story presents us with high school girl emotions and time travel and consequences of actions in the same package. After a while I was surprised to see a scene in which a bullied high school student snaps and does something really bad. It took courage to present something like that in a basically feel good movie. And the ending is not that happy either. Hopeful, but not happy.So, one can watch it both for the high quality of the animation, the sci-fi part or the romantic part, yet somehow it didn't affect me so much. Maybe it was because of the bad translation filter I had the misfortune to use or maybe it is the high expectations for a film that won a Best Animation award in Japan."
60,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,,2 January 2018,A Fascinating Examination Of The Ripple Effect Our Actions Can Have On Others' Lives,"Examining relationships & the ripple effect of our actions with its time-travel premise, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is an original & imaginative coming-of-age drama that nicely blends the elements of sci-fi, comedy & romance into one amusing story, and is finely animated from start to finish.The Girl Who Leapt Through Time follows a 17-year old girl who inadvertently gains the ability to leap through time and starts using her new found powers for her own personal benefits. However, she soon finds out that frivolous use of time-leaps hasn't just affecting her own life but lives of many others as well.Directed by Mamoru Hosoda, the film doesn't concern itself with figuring out the technical process behind time-leaps and simply runs with the concept. The tone is light-hearted for the most part, and it utilises its humour to good effect. Things do get grim & serious in the second half but the ending isn't satisfying enough.The animation is rich, colourful & wonderfully detailed. Characters however aren't very compelling, and interest in their journey is lot mid-way. The story becomes repetitive after a while, as expected, but its riveting quality continues diminishing with time, and the wait for its conclusion ultimately becomes more prominent.On an overall scale, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is engaging & entertaining to quite an extent but it simply loses its grip just before the final act. There is a lot to like here, especially its animation & wit, but it's missing that x-factor ingredient that would've allowed it to hover above ground and attain better heights. Worth a shot anyway."
61,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,28 December 2017,Time travel with heart.,"Wow. The movements and mannerisms make one forgot they are watching an animation. More than that is the fact that this is a great film. It can be summed up in one untranslatable japanese word: ""setsunai"" (which in english roughly means ""heartbreakingly bittersweet and nostalgic"")."
62,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,2,10 December 2017,"Incoherent, unintertesting, not for me","Everybody has their own taste and this isn't mine. Maybe if I was 12 years old I'd love it, but I'm not. It's dull, silly, uninteresting - and there's something about that's not altogether wholesome. Can't quite put this into words, but it's just a little bit creepy. Left me feeling a tad uncomfortable. I quite like the genre but this I found boring, dull, how many more lines do I have to type in to this review of mine? A few more by the looks of it - and hey! - I was just trying to be succinct and economical. One-line review? Don't bother. One of the IMDb reviewers indicated this was a life-changing experience for them. I dread to think what their life was like before this trivial movie changed it...."
63,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,26 March 2016,Please watch it,"The name of the movie is fantastic to pull the crowd but more importantly there is a real heart touching story. The story tells us that we need to act when we are in that moment and there is no point regretting over it if you were still and didn't act. The story telling is fantastic I wouldn't say it wasn't the best but really please do watch it, you will not be disappointed. Just to remind it's just a movie so doesn't expect a lot from it but it sure is good on whatever it wants to convey. Makoto is a very free spirited character and does what she likes. She has two good friends. These are some of the most important things a person needs to have otherwise its simply not worth living in this society. The story is of course about time travel but will not bother you much as it is kind of a requirement, there is not much mystery or hype about it so its good thing about the movie. In simple terms please don't focus on time travel but on other aspects of the movie."
64,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,7,11 July 2015,I want to leap through time,"If only I could leap through time, it would be great to fix the mistakes we all made as human beings or what we would like to happen. This film showed us this.I wouldn't call this movie the magnificent anime film I ever seen but it does give your brain a lot of questions with the two words 'if only'. I did wish Chiaki Mamiya and Makoto Konno kissed in the end. I didn't figure he was gonna be the love of her life since I thought he was sleazy but as the film went on, he was the complete opposite! It's amazing how the character really changes into something you wouldn't imagine! Although I honestly hated him when he kept calling her 'stupid' even as a 'joke'. The film didn't really bring tears to my eyes but it is scary when those people including Makoto were about to die as the train was about to hit them. I found Makoto a bit whingy but she really stood out to be an intelligent girl to look up to. I would give this movie 7/10"
65,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,9,30 December 2013,"This is an excellent, dramatic movie with a small amount of romance thrown in","If you suddenly gained the ability to quite literally leap through time, what would you use it for? The sheer fun of it? Getting better grades? Or something else? What if you merely wanted the present to continue; to still live out those memorable days with your friends, playing around and having fun; rejecting the future and not wanting things to change? In the movie, a girl is presented with this exact possibility. She suddenly finds out that she has been granted the ability to travel through time, and uses this ability for the purposes mentioned above. At first she tries to correct all the mistakes she made that same day she got the ability; from preventing making a mess out of things in cooking class to dodging people being hurled towards her. And before soon, she tries to keep the times from changing, undoing love confessions and other events which can change her and her two friends' lives.However, everything has a consequence.Even the seemingly most insignificant and puerile of acts can have grave consequences, as such acts are often made out of ignorance or selfishness; both which are traits that rarely bring out a good result if actions are based on them. Our heroine has to learn this the hard way, as she sees how fateful her so-called insignificant acts are, and how wrong she is in her childish beliefs. What she want is merely to keep the fun times around; with her and her two beloved friends. She wants time to stop, to remain in the present. However, time is inexorable; the future is relentlessly closing in on us. And she has to learn this the hard way. But she learns. Through hardships, through death, and most important of all, through love, she learns that the future is not something to be avoided. Rather it is something to be cherished; something one should embrace.And that is the basics of the plot and characters in this story; a girl who repeatedly travels back in time to keep the times as they are, and actually learns during this process that it is better to look forward and into the future rather than intransigently dwell on the present. Her two friends aren't focused on that much, but both are portrayed beautifully when they are, both the though-shelled Chiaki and the obliging Kousuke. Accompanying the beautiful plot is a standard-fare movie animation; which means beautiful and detailed landscapes, cityscapes and backgrounds. And while character movements are fluid, the designs themselves are a bit lackluster, and should have been more detailed. The soundtrack which follows on top is equally beautiful, with serene piano tracks accompanying the at times laughter-provoking and at times melancholy story, and a somewhat expected, yet beautiful ending theme.It's a beautiful movie, which is good for many things, but especially its underlying hints about looking towards the future and accepting that the present will change as well as the simple message that every act has a consequence; especially childish and ignorant acts at that. And even if such themes does not interest you, I think this beautiful story is well worth spending one and a half hour of your life watching."
66,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,8,30 November 2008,"good story, little plot and surprises, nostalgic anime art","This film is nice and warm. But if one is looking for sci-fi actions, adult themes, violence and such, don't bother.This is a heart warming high school crush mixed with looping time travel.As with my title, it's a fairly linear story even though there is time-traveling involved. The story revolves around the girl and the events that happens to her, and her meddling with them by leaping through time.There is indeed very little plot and fewer surprises. It is just that, a heartwarming film about teenagers sorting through their emotions. What else needs to be said? The art brings back some nostalgia. Few animes are done with such warm tones anymore, much less the simple style.The movie is very well drawn, clean and not particularly colorful, seems to be tinted in yellow.Overall, a nice film that one can go through without any effort."
67,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,7,6 January 2015,it's overrated,"This film is very good don't get me wrong but this film is not in the anime hall of fame as so many say. I've seen so many films better than this one that I find it incredible that so many people value this film so highly. The artwork is great but not nearly as good as underrated films such as Journey to Agartha (Children Who Chase Lost Voices), Patema Inverted, Paprika, and even Coraline. I think this film is way overrated and that ultimately unless you relate to the teenage love story its really just not that great of a film. I love how people compare all other animes to movies like this that aren't twice as good as half the others out there. Basically.....this film is pretty darn good but worse than half the other anime films out there even though it is praised as one of the best. Even Summer Wars is much better than this film. And that film is not nearly as highly reviewed and not that good itself but I watched both back to back. I actually think this film is best skipped if you have a real good anime waiting to be watched. Extremely overrated but still good. Quiet better than anything you will see in American animation half the time."
