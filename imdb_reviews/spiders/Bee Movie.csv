0,Bee Movie,7,4 November 2007,Lighthearted Humor - Fun Movie,"This is a silly movie. It's goal is to make you laugh, and little beyond that. Indeed I laughed for most of the movie. It is hard for me to find much fault when I am laughing that much. That the last act had fewer jokes was a minor misstep. The characters were cute and the story didn't get in the way of the humor. And I kind of enjoyed the story, it was a little odd and funny.It is unusual among animated movies in that its focus is jokes, kind of like a stand-up act. There are a lot of these jokes and they are quite funny! Does anything feel better than laughing? (OK, well very few things.) The story is mainly there as a vehicle for the jokes. So perhaps slightly different expectations will serve you well with this movie.Don't go to this for a serious story! It is light humor, and at that game a great success. If you recognize that that is what the filmmakers are going for, then you will enjoy it. If you are expecting an incredible story or thrilling action or amazing animated beauty, then you might be disappointed.As lighthearted humor with playful animation, and a great ending song, the film is a success."
1,Bee Movie,6,1 December 2007,"[ Insert ""bee"" pun here ]","Bee Movie has its moments of brilliance, but they are few and far between, and I think what weakens this movie the most is the fact that most other movies have already beaten it to its punches. There's nothing too original here. Most notably, it bears many similarities to the 1998 animated film, Antz, starring Woody Allen as the insect living in a perfectly functioning society who begins to question his importance in the greater scheme of things. And much like DreamWorks' previous animated film, Sharktale, featured many fish-themed puns, Bee Movie tries the same thing, except with bee puns, and you'll learn fairly quickly that there's not a lot to work with in that area. And, let's face it: Larry King has appeared as himself in so many movies that the gimmick itself has become an irritating cliché. Here he is, in complete bee form. I think they've taken him as far as he can go.Altogether, though, Bee Movie is not without its charms. It does eventually find itself in some odd, uncharted territories (could a bee really fall in love with a human?), there are plenty of funny moments, and yes, even some of those puns work. Jerry Seinfeld, who has taken a lot of pride in writing, producing, acting in, and promoting the movie, does do a very good job voicing the main character. You sometimes feel like these actors doing voices for cartoons are just phoning it in, but Seinfeld gives a surprisingly energetic performance. I could picture him mimicking Barry B. Benson's movements in a recording booth as I heard his voice; it's obvious he was passionate about every aspect to the movie. The rest of the cast does a good job, too: Renee Zellwegger, Matthew Broderick, Patrick Warburton, as well as John Goodman in a brief role, who once again proves what an amazingly talented voice actor he is. Whenever there's a need for a big, burly character, John Goodman is the go-to guy, because, well, he IS a big, burly character. Ray Liotta's cameo was also a highlight, and much more inspired than King's cameo.It may not be a perfect movie, or the most original, and for a 90-minute run-time, it kind of drags on a bit, but for all that it is, I can't say that it wasn't entertaining. It won't go down in the history of greatest animated films, but it may be a decent way to spend a rainy day, when you can't go out and fly.My rating: 6/10 P.S.If you're knowledgeable about your animated films, you may remember the slight controversy surrounding Finding Nemo, which inspired a few children to flush their fishes down the toilet so they could ""free"" them into the ocean. Bee Movie just may plant some worse ideas in kids' heads. Keep an eye out for news stories about children getting stung by bees after trying to make friends with them once they see the movie. Maybe Larry King could do a special about it."
2,Bee Movie,8,4 November 2007,Ignore the critics.  We had a great time.,"Is the Bee Movie the best animated movie we've ever seen? No. But, defying the critics, I took my 11 year old daughter (who didn't really want to go) and my 5 year old son to see the movie and we all really enjoyed it. Most importantly, the story and humor of the movie operates at multiple levels, so it appealed to all of us at our individual age level. What is beyond dispute is that the visual feel of the movie is incredible. Some of the bee hive interior and flight scenes were just breathtaking. My kids were spellbound.To me the best judge of a movie is how fast it moves along. This one kept us all entertained throughout and its 90 minute running time felt like half that. So, ignore the critics, and take your kids. They'll have a great time, and even if you're not a Seinfeld fan, so will you."

4,Bee Movie,6,11 November 2007,This is a movie about nothing. Seinfeld's quick-paced and witty humor flies past the kids and stings the adults,"A professor in the University of Central Florida that taught me very well about cinema, submitted a wonderful script to different movie studios about two kids over the summer living with their father inside a boat, as they sail the western hemisphere for multiple reasons. But, despite the good script, had a major issue that did not allow for it to ever be filmed: it did not figure out its audience and failed to reach a demographic to aim for. The script was much too mature for kids to watch; yet the piece was about kids, which wouldn't interest the adults. It was a coming-of-age story that would have issues entertaining anybody, despite the rich material. This is the biggest issue of Bee Movie.Bee Movie tries to entertain kids and adults yet has very little humor for the children, nevertheless a plethora of jokes for the adultsbut the cutesy factor becomes a turn-off for the parents. As a matter of fact, Bee Movie could have definitely benefited from edgier material and aiming the film towards an older audience. Jerry Seinfeld has a wonderful story to tell, but the kids would definitely not be interested. Bee Movie involves a major lawsuit, celebrity cameos, hidden humor about actors, and the typical Seinfeld humor that made the comedian a household name back in the 90s. The movie does have its laughs, does indeed contain its moments, but it could have been much better if it didn't try so hard to appeal to the kids.In this movie, we follow a recently graduated bee by the name of Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) that decides to fly away from the hive to see the world prior to picking the one job he'll work for the rest of his life, whatever that may be. After an incident involving a tennis ball, a spunky florist Vanessa (Renee Zellweger) saves him. As his relationship with humans, especially Vanessa, improves, he learns that humans eat honey and decides to sue the entire human race. About a dozen of well-known actors and actresses are sprinkled in this movie, ranging from Oprah Winfrey to Ray Liotta to Chris Rock to even Sting (okay, so he doesn't act). The best vocal performances in this movie however come from Matthew Broderick (Ferris Bueller, adult Simba) and of course, Patrick Warburton (Kronk in Emperor's New Groove, The Tick, and Joe from Family Guy).Unfortunately for Dreamworks, Pixar is once again raising the bar in animation with the incredible Ratatouille earlier this summer. So, with such competition, the animation department suffers a lot. Whenever the action slows down (the flying sequences, albeit not enough of them, were good) the lack of detail becomes obvious; the trees look the same, the buildings look the same, and some of the voices doesn't match the faces. For example, when Ken (Warburton again) screams and rants, his face does not match the explosion of rage. Even older flicks like Madagascar, Over the Hedge, and Ice Age looked better. Seinfeld's vision of the bee world was unveiled, but not with a rather lack of detail.Where the movie scores its biggest points lies in the fast-paced, unpredictable humor of Jerry Seinfeld. This is a well-written story with an original plot and plenty of jokes to throw at everybody. The slapstick and physical humor rather misses more than hits, but the Seinfeld-humor (you whether understand this very well, or not at all) delivers most definitely. Whether it's the sidesplitting one-liners, subtle pop culture gags, or the hilarious cameos (Ray Liotta's scene was comic gold), the Master of Nothing still has the jokebug in his blood. The performances do indeed enhance the experience, but some are underused; best example is Chris Rock. The slow moments come whenever slapstick replaces dialogue, and it happens several times.Bottom Line: Bee Movie is a decent flick for adults, but not that great for kids. Finding the balance between material for kids and material for adults is not easy yet in this film it becomes so one-sided, you wind up laughing a lot but feeling sorry for the kids watching at the same exact time. The story and dialogue are unique and refreshing, but at the same time it almost feels wasted because half the audience will get a kick out of it. Jerry Seinfeld once again delivers, but should probably try to stay away from making substance for kids, and remain with the witty adults. Animation isn't a big deal either, so the visuals will not astound you that much either. Instead, come in for the great dialogue and a potential step towards making more computer-animated flicks for just teenagers and adults---even though this genre is almost always marketed towards the ""rugrats."""
5,Bee Movie,5,6 November 2007,"Nowhere close to ""Toy Story""","For the first 30 minutes I thought that Bee Movie had a chance to become a classic like ""Toy Story"" but as the minutes ticked away, I realized it wasn't going to happen. Unlike Toy Story, Bee Movie does not have a central antagonist. Remember ""Sid"", the psycho kid who terrorizes the toys in Toy Story? What a marvelous creepy kid! Bee Movie offers up a number of limp opponents to Seinfeld's Barry B. Benson. There's the completely unfunny macho tennis player boyfriend in the beginning who is constantly trying to smash Barry to a pulp and an odious obese attorney who ends up having an allergy attack after he's stung by Barry's sidekick, Adam (couldn't understand why Adam was still alive after he stung the attorney--wasn't it established early on that bees die right away after they sting their target?).Ultimately it's Barry's own misguided idealism which becomes the ""villain"" after he successfully sues humankind for stealing the bees' honey. It's good for an exploration of Barry's 'inner journey' but a movie still needs an actual real world antagonist to root against. In Ratatouille, a rat speaks to a cook in a restaurant but he's the only one who can hear the rat. And there's a purpose to the relationshipthe rat helps the cook to become a great chef. In Bee Story, there are awkward romantic suggestions between Vanessa (Rene Zelwegger) and Barry and obviously that's an idea that doesn't work since it cannot be put into practice. It would have been much better if Vanessa is the only human who can hear Barry. And perhaps the character could have been some kind of 'pet psychic' now branching off into the insect world.I felt there could have been much more done within the 'hive' itself. A great opportunity was lost when nothing was done with the idea of a QUEEN BEE character (there was one lame joke about a cross-dressing 'queen bee' halfway through the movie). And Chris Rock's Mosquito should have been Barry's sidekick throughout most of the movie (not Adam!).In Toy Story, the toys leave the 'ordinary world' of a child's playroom and end up in the dangerous real world. The scenes where Barry leaves the hive and must confront all the dangers of the NATURAL WORLD was the best part of the movie (most people have alluded to the tennis ball scene as a particularly strong visual scene). The writers should have kept Barry outside the hive for most of the movie but should NOT have pitted him mainly against human characters. A threat from the insect world (such as a king of the roaches modeled on some kind of contemporary madman like the Iranian president) would have been a much better threat to the bee world then the idea that their honey was being taken away from them by humans. That idea doesn't really make sense since in reality bees continue to make honey despite human encroachment. I'm not suggesting that the whole lawsuit idea had to be jettisoned but it should have been a minor story line. I also found the climax of the movie to be unsatisfyingthe bees guiding a jetliner to the ground seemed ludicrous. What's more, with great sentimentality, all the bees seemed to be elevated to a saintly status at the end of the movie.The writers should have emulated Pixar who know how to successfully anthropomorphize their non-human characters (displaying the gamut of human foibles). There were many witty lines in Bee Movie and you can thank Jerry Seinfeld for his clever humor. If only more thought was put into the overall plot, then this could have been a classic!"
6,Bee Movie,9,5 November 2007,Take flight and shake off the blues with yellow!!!,"I must admit, my first impression was it would be just for kids. I was pleasantly surprised just how much of a kid I still am! The Bee Movie was an adventure in honey heaven. The cheerful animation and very funny script kept me flying high to the very end! I loved this movie. It lifted my spirit and helped me to relate to my own dull working world experience. I see so much potential in this film for sequels and spin-offs. A clever script and comic timing that only Jerry Seinfeld has mastered, this film is sure to take you on a journey. It blends fantasy and reality so delicately they are both interchangeable. Seinfeld was at his best. I also have a new respect for the little buggers (bees)! I recommend this movie to anyone who feels trapped in their routine... set yourself free and see the Bees!"
7,Bee Movie,2,11 November 2007,Bee Flat,"This is a mediocre and uninspired script packaged in cutesy computer animated figures (soon headed for your nearest toy store shelves). This film is an easily forgettable loser in trying to entertain children. It doesn't entertain adults much either because it lacks the playfully devilish double entendre humor you find in animated cartoons like ""Shrek"" or ""The Simspons Movie."" The only side-splitting humor is in a mosquito character voiced by Chris Rock - and that lasts just a few precious screen minutes. He would have made a great sidekick to the Seinfeld bee character, but alas, I guess Jerry didn't want to be upstaged by another comedian.Instead, Bee Movie is low-calorie on energy, excitement, slapstick and the tickle-your-funnybone fun-loving momentum that propelled classic animated cartoons like ""Cars,"" ""Toy Story,"" ""Robots,"" and ""Over the Hedge."" The laughs are few and far between. I watched this in a theater with lots of families and I can count on one hand the number of times children giggled with delight.So, this movie met my worst apprehension: a television sitcom comic tries to make a children's cartoon with a lot of clever dialog but little action.For example, the parody on using outside personalities like CNN's Larry King,the rock star Sting, and Ray Liotta is completely lost on young viewers (but it did guarantee a promotional spot for Jerry Seinfeld on the real Larry King Live broadcast). Also, I can't think of anything more boring in a children's film than having courtroom scenes, of all things. The worst and scariest bad guy the cartoon has to offer is a lawyer in a three-piece suit. Nyuk! nyuk! yet *another* lawyer caricature.Bee Movie tries to work in a gratuitous environmentalism statement in the final 15 minutes. But by the time that rolls in you've already looked at your watch a few times wondering where you parked the car.There's nothing honey sweet about this film, it's purely Saccharine: no nutritional value and bad aftertaste."
8,Bee Movie,,24 December 2007,enjoyable as can bee,"Sharp, funny animated feature about a beemused young bee and recent college graduate who learns that he's destined to work a routine colony job for the rest of his life. Although his natural instinct is to beeware of humans, his life takes a turn for the better when he meets a saintly florist who not only beefriends him, but helps him quickly file a lawsuit beefore humans can take all the credit for mass production of honey! Occasionally too silly for words, probably by intention, but lots to take in with superb animation, good gags, and quirky, memorable characters. Comedy is uneven at times, but still serves as acceptable entertainment for kids and adults alike. ***"
9,Bee Movie,1,4 January 2008,The worst thing to happen since I crapped myself.,"This film is awful. Horrible. Not good. Even for kids. Even for adults. It is just bad.The intro is horribly written, imagine you and a work friend are walking to work, and your mate turns to you and says ""We are going to work, at the factory, where we make pies, to sell to people. That is my lot in life"". Would that not strike you as a little strange? Yes it would, somebody stating the obvious to me like that would result in me hurting them in the face. The dialogue in this opening section is this bad.The film then decides to start off about 7000 plot lines (""I Don't WANT TO WORK FOREVER IN THE SAME JOB!"" ""HUMANS STEAL MY HONEY!"" "" I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH A HUMAN!"" ""IM GOING TO COURT!"" ""THE WORLD IS DYING!"") each of which is either stolen from Antz, or just stupid (how would the Bee have sexual intercourse with a human woman? You could'nt even do it carefully).The graphics look like a bus drivers face, average and yet longing for something more, and Patrick Warburton turns up again playing a muscle bound moron. His mother must cry at night. Yet again he is the best thing in this horribly written movie.Events happen, with seemingly no logic, or sense, or even meaning. Jerry just wrote this, after watching loads, and loads of other animated animal movies, over a weekend, whilst he was having sex with a shoe. Rubbish.This film came about because over dinner Jerry Seinfeld told an awful joke (Bee movie, B movie, gettit? I just wet myself...and you) and it shows.Jerry, give Larry David a phone call.Overall..screw summing up, just avoid this film, stick on Curb and bask in the glory of David. And if your a child, just vomit or something. it will be more fun."
10,Bee Movie,7,6 December 2007,Humorous,"It was a light hearted-animated-comedy-for the whole family. It taught good values, like take pride in what you do as a person. But it was geared in my opinion toward little kids. I took my 3 cousins (3 years to 8 Years) and they loved it but they wanted to get bees as pets.... try to explaining why a 3 year old can't have a bee as a pet. When i saw the parts in the court room the way the bees moved in sync it was amazing. It has nothing on the original computer generated movie ""Shrek"". It set all kinds of ground work for newer movies like The Bee Movie. The CG of the bees flying was a pretty cool look how they all flew in droves just like it was an actual bees taking flight. I think that there should be more family friendly films like this one. But, all in all it was a good Flick."
11,Bee Movie,6,22 March 2008,Mildly Amusting Animated Effort,"""Mildly amusing"" is probably the best description of this recently-released (on DVD) animated feature. My reviews on animated movies are what I thought of it as an adult, and how adults would relate to it. For this one, I'd say this is not a film adults will run out and buy: rent - yes/maybe; purchase - no.The animation and story might be something kids will still enjoy but most of the gags fall flat for adults, although it does have a few clever things in it. It just isn't up to some of the truly funny animated films of the past few years. That said, it was still fun to watch with some humorous drawings in the background that you have to watch for quickly.As for the story, for a film with a lot of politically-correct messages, stereotypical characters, Liberal icons plugged, etc., it was surprising to see a commonsense ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" conclusion. Kudos for that, but there are just too many dumb parts in this story. The connection of a talking bee with a human girlfriend was too ludicrous to be entertaining, as were the courtroom scenes.The animation was fair. Yes, a story with flowers as a key ingredient is going to be colorful, so there is plenty of color but it looked kind of washed out and blah to what it could have been (i.e. ""Cars,"" ""Polar Express,"" etc.). I expected more out of a Dreamworks film.Overall, for adults: skip it. It just isn't funny enough to invest your time. For the little kids, sure - they'll like it. They like almost almost any animated movie."
12,Bee Movie,1,7 March 2008,Airplanes do not fly like that!,"This was one of the worst CGI films that I have seen in a long time. Basically this bee goes outside and gets caught and then there's this really boring part in the middle and some stuff happens in court. Then all of the flowers die because the bees don't work anymore. This in itself made me angry that this movie was released but what happened next only made me angrier. The stupid bee and his human friend stole a float for and got on a plane for some reason. This, like I said made me angry but this next part took the freakin cake; the plane gets struck by lightning and everything fries. After than millions of bees come and land the plane. Airplanes don't work like that! Everyone should have died!"
13,Bee Movie,1,5 May 2008,Must have been written by urban idjits,"When bee keepers are portrayed as evil scoundrels, it's time to question the intelligence of writers. Not only do they have no concept of bees and bee keeping, they don't know that only the sterile females do all the work. Male bees are DRONES, who do nothing but fertilize young queens. Which underscores why useless people are called drones. We might extend that term to include the writers and producers of this movie. Granted, animation is basically aimed at fanciful imagination and impossible situations. But let's keep it funny. Gross error and stupidity is not funny. Smokers don't kill bees - they discourage bee aggression. Even the ""ecological"" theme is skewed. The idea of entertainment is to entertain. This movie fails to do so. Undoubtedly, fans of Seinfeld and self absorbed urban culture will enjoy parts of this, but overall, it's awful. Jerry, revive ""Seinfeld"" if you want to parody New York culture, but spare us from further ""bumbling"" beez niss."
14,Bee Movie,1,12 October 2010,Such a stupid movie,"When this was on TV a few months back I decided to watch it as I like watching kids movies because they are adorable and fun to watch. So I decided to check out Bee Movie which seemed to be alright.Boy was I wrong.Jerry Seinfield from that show that was on in the 90s voices Barry a bee who interacts with the humans in NYC Manhattan. As the honey is selling around NYC he befriends a florist girl named Vanessa (Renee Zellwegger)who helps him.What I really hated about this film is that the rest of the humans hate bees and Vanessa does't,Jerry was so annoying he was too immature to voice that bee even Robin Williams might have done a better job in it. The whole film is boring,and the cast is awful I had to switch it over to something better as my parents found it stupid too.I saw the first half and thought oh this sucks bad. If you like computer-generated movies then be my guest but you have been warned.1/10Verdict: A silly kids flick that should be watched by 2 year olds."
15,Bee Movie,2,25 April 2008,I Got No Buzz From This Movie,"It's hard to say exactly what it was about this movie that failed. The animation was well done (although for some reason I was struggling all the way through with why the bees only have 4 legs - they're insects! They should have 6!) and the actors voicing the parts (led by Jerry Seinfeld and Renee Zellweger) do a pretty good job. Somehow, though, ""The Bee Movie"" just failed to connect with me from Minute 1. I found myself wishing they could have come up with a more imaginative title, and a more entertaining story to go along with that more imaginative title. As it is, we get a movie with a dull title and a lacklustre story that I had to truly fight to stay with.Somehow this story of a bee (Barry B. Benson, voiced by Seinfeld) getting tired of the rigidly structured life in the hive and running off to have a look outside just didn't work. It had some potential -the whole bee falling in love with a beautiful woman (Zellweger) - should have led to some laughs, but I don't think I even chuckled mildly a single time. I was bugged by the rating the movie had. It was rated PG in Canada, with a warning of sexually suggestive comments that might be inappropriate for children. Given that everyone involved with making this movie must have known that children were going to watch it - why include the sexually suggestive comments? I'm wondering if there was an environmental point being made - take away even the most irritating pest we have and we end up with disaster? I don't know. What I do know is that I just plain didn't care much for this movie. 2/10"
16,Bee Movie,4,19 January 2008,Mediocre,"Writing as a 14 year old girl, this movie is...mediocre. I didn't particularly want to see it in the first place, but there wasn't much else on at the cinema, so I was stuck.So into a theatre of 6-10 year olds we go and we watch Bee Movie.The plot is...pretty weird. Even for a animated movie. Madagascar and Over The Hedge (Dreamworks' previous CGI films.) aren't believable obviously, but Bee Movie's plot is just a little too strange. It starts off with the main protagonist Barry graduating and getting a tour of his hive. He realises that he will always work the same job until he dies, which, obviously, freaks him out and he sneaks into the team that gets pollen and nectar. During this flight (introduce plot line number two) he meets Vannessa, a human, whom he seems to be infatuated with. I have to mention here, even though this is a story, the whole Bee loves Human thing made me squirm in my seat. It's so...cheesy almost and just downright silly. And later Adam mentions that Barry and Vannessa have been making out (which is just something Adam adds in). That just made me say 'What the hell?' He's a bee himself and he should freaking know that it's impossible. I'm pretty sure the younger viewers felt the same way too. So the story moves on and suddenly the 'love affair' is pretty much over and we introduce plot number 3. Barry finds out humans have been stealing honey. But he never really explains why this bugs him (no pun intended). He only says its hard work, but he never worked himself, so how does he know? So they got to court and the bees win. Flowers begin to die, but surely the whole world's flower population cannot die because of bees? What about the other insects? So anyway, Barry and Vannessa go to a flower convention and get some flowers and try to fly home. Aaand I wont reveal the rest because it isn't necessary.So as you can see,the plot is pretty messed up, but the film's aim isn't story, it's humour. At my age, you begin to appreciate innuendos and the like, and there are a few...but not enough. Yes, it is a family film, but think of the first Shrek movie. That's a family film and had plenty of adult and child humour in it. This is where Bee Movie fails. It simply wasn't that funny, even for a child. I could count about 5 times in a 90 minute movie where more that 3 people laughed, and when you think about it, it isn't that much.Now on to the rest.Visual: The CG is good. I, personally prefer 2D animation, but the colours were lively and I loved the look of the honey. What I really liked were the flight scenes, the looked amazing, sometimes the felt like you were a bee flying with them.Voices and Music: A few names I could recognise, believe it or not, I'd never heard of Jerry Seinfield (I'm British, so that might not help) but I had heard of Renee Zellweger, Chris Rock and Matthew Broderick (only because I watched Lion King a million time when I was young). The voice acting was fine, nobody grated on my nerves unlike some films.The music, by Hans Zimmer if I remember correctly, seemed a little to dramatic at times. Lovely as it was, at some points it didn't fit at all, and added to the cheese factor a bit.Would I see it again?: No, once is plenty. Would I recommend it to a friend?: If that friend was under 8. Was it worth the money?: To be honest no. If I had to see it again, I don't think I would pay above £3."
17,Bee Movie,4,1 January 2008,Patchy children's animation,"As with many computer-animated films this is a sharply observed visual comedy grafted over hilarious voice-over. For about ten minutes. Then, amazingly, they run out of ideas. All the bee jokes are front-loaded and the film can't survive either on it's script - which has been left quite open for improvising - or on Seinfeld/Zellweger riffing - because that's a bit weak too.I was waiting (along with 40 easily bored children, who didn't get the Pomp & Circumstance joke when I did, to my embarrassment) for some drama to cut in, rather like the revenge or rescue plots of the Toy Stories. The writing team are keen not to get in too deep and stick to the surface gags. Though these revive every so often, it's not particularly satisfying over 90 mins. 4/10"
18,Bee Movie,3,6 November 2007,"Bee afraid, bee very afraid","Why? That is the important question. Why was this movie made at all? I know Seinfeld was a ""show about nothing"" and I am a Seinfeld fan. This was a movie about nothing, but unlike the TV show, Bee Movie was agonizingly unfunny, pointless, and meandering. Whoever green-lighted this script clearly has a substance abuse problem.I see lots of people are falling all over themselves with praise because this movie is cute, harmless, and not dirty. For goodness sake, folks, raise your standards! This is 2007! CG movies with cute characters are a dime a dozen. As consumers, we should express a desire for genuinely worthwhile, well thought, funny kids/CG movies. Otherwise, we will get more and more of this drivel, and worse. The only good point for Bee Movie, is that they did not descend into a bunch of toilet humor. On the other hand, the instances that you could call ""humor"" at all were few and far between.They anthropromorphized something else non-human. This is not a bad idea in itself, but it has been done so much better before; giving life stories and every little nuance of human civilization to Bees. Everything has clever little names, mostly variants of ""bee"" or ""honey."" Only problem is that in this case, most of the clever naming and theming of the bee world falls flat, stupid, and causes eye rolls - as opposed to say, Cars, which did it about a thousand times better.Next to Bee Movie, even the usual also-rans of animation such as Over the Hedge, and Madagascar, seem like genuine masterpieces and instant classics. I snickered a time or two, but sitting through the rest was in no way worth it. Children who are simple enough to be held in awe by anything that is animated, will really dig this movie. I'm sure as their age and sophistication increase past 6 or 7, kids will even begin to wish this movie was as sharp and funny as the dozens of better CG movies they have been exposed to.Sting and Ray Liota? That was just plain dumb, and really not worth revisiting several times in the movie. The movie pace and feel actually had a little mediocre passable groove going, until the idiotic lawsuit plot got rolling. That brought everything to a crashing halt. John Goodman's performance fell flat, seeming to be a chemical induced over the top fat lawyer with a huge drawl (in New York?) It was almost embarrassing to hear him desperately trying to do something funny with this disaster of a script. With a great script, he can do over the top and weird characters superbly like in O Brother and Big Lebowski, but here he should not have touched the part. Chris Rock was one of the funniest parts of the whole movie, making me chuckle more than any other character, although he was only around for about 3 minutes total. The 90 minute running time seemed to crawl by, and I would have sworn I had been in there at least 2 hours.In summary, unlike other CG movies we are used to, this has next to nothing for the grownups, and not much more for the kids. I don't know if Seinfeld is washed up, his time is past, or just rich and lazy these days, but this is not a positive for his career. Take the kids if you must, but don't bother bringing your spouse. And you're certainly not going to find yourself sneaking this one in the DVD player when nobody else is around like some of us might occasionally find ourselves doing with The Incredibles or Ice age."
19,Bee Movie,10,2 April 2016,Absolutely Thrilling Display of Cinematography Mastery,"Bee movie is a thrilling experience a person of any age could find themselves immersed in. The casting for this movie could not have been done any better 69/10. Ben Stiller really makes me feel like I'm part of the honey bee's ecosystem. Through the ups and downs of Barry's adventure, Ben Stiller coveys the emotion that needs to be expressed, making me feel for Barry like I've never felt for any character ever. I cried, I laughed, I EXPERIENCED the emotional thrill ride that is Bee Movie. If you want a movie to wow and entertain your entire family, this is option #1. I have never seen such beautiful animation from any western developed anime. I was astounded by the amount of care put into every movement, every line of the script, and especially, into my heart. This movie will forever hold a place in my heart, making it one of the best, if not the best anime movies of all time."
20,Bee Movie,1,18 November 2007,Big disappointment,"My husband and I took our ten-year-old grandson to see this movie, assuming it would be a delight. It was not. My grandson laughed two or three times; same for me. My husband fell asleep. Boring is the best word I can think of to describe the movie. I will say that some of the writing directed at adults was clever, but it wasn't enough to carry the film. I'm a fan of Jerry Seinfeld, but even he couldn't make this movie something worth seeing. Many children's movies have lovely animation and cute little characters ... that just isn't enough ... they must be entertaining and interesting. Lots of children's movies have succeeded, but this one doesn't. Wait for the DVD rental."
21,Bee Movie,1,2 November 2007,Yawn,"What happened to Seinfeld? Did someone kidnap him and replace him with a dull identical twin? Those who loved his sitcom will be sorely disappointed by Bee Movie (which is, indeed, a B-Movie). The idea is not bad bees decide to sue humans for stealing their honeybut the execution is clumsy and there are very few laugh-out-loud jokes. All the talent in the film (and there's a lot: Renee Zellweger, Oprah Winfrey, Chris Rock, Matthew Broderick, Kathy Bates, etc) doesn't change the fact that there's very little about this movie that's original, witty, or funny.Overall, the movie was predictable and boring and, coming from a famous comedian, what could be worse than that?"
22,Bee Movie,,4 November 2007,Not really for children,"I thought it was very funny in patches - Chris Rock gets some great lines - but also very slow in parts. Too ""talky"" for an animated movie, and the central conflict: humans stealing honey from bees, was much too tame to make for great drama. Loved the aerial scenes, especially Barry's first flight out of the hive.However, the reason why I'm writing a comment is because I don't think it's appropriate for kids. I took my 6 year old because he wanted to see it. He sat silently for most of the movie. Afterwards he said that it wasn't nice that they shot Winnie the Pooh and also attacked the old lady at the restaurant, pushing her head down so she gasped ""I can't breathe."" It made him very sad. He says that he had fun but I and my son both think that it is inappropriate for kids under 7."
23,Bee Movie,1,3 December 2008,Indescribably Boring,"With most CG animated movies, I can watch them more than once. This isn't the case with Bee Movie. I've tried to watch it again on two separate occasions and I absolutely could not. It is indescribably boring and unfathomably dull. I could watch paint dry and be more engaged than this. They could have taken the themes of working class life and run with it, made it something that could really touch adults. Instead, they pretty much abandon that in a flash for a crazy ""love story"" that never really seems like a love story at all. Then they bring in things about bee cruelty, which intend to make the viewer ""look through a bee's eyes"" and abruptly abandon that for... I really don't know anymore. It's just one giant, honey-flavored mess. It's also laden with cheesy bee jokes and overused talent. Patrick Warburton and John Goodman have done enough animated movies recently to satisfy an entire century. So, in short, don't see this. It's easily one of Dreamworks' worst."
24,Bee Movie,1,24 November 2007,Awful.,"This movie was previewed as a wonderful little kids film about bees. And that's how they reel you in. You see little cgi bees and you think that, ""Awe, how could something so cute be so horrible?"" And then you hear that Jerry Seinfeld is in it and you think, ""Awe, I liked his TV show. How could he not be funny."" And then you hear about the big name actors in it and think, ""Awe, how could all these terrific actors with successful careers ever be in a bad movie?"" Then you see it... and all you think is ""Awful. Simply and horrendously awful. Awful in the 'I just lost $8.50' way."" The overall story was not engaging and felt empty.The comedy was sub-par, with only the few slapstick gags actually bringing any laughs.The musical score had nothing engaging, which is disappointing from Hans Zimmer.The voice acting was good and so was the cgi, but they just acted a bad movie well.In the end it was horrible. Absolutely horrible."
25,Bee Movie,5,2 November 2007,Laughs in my theater,"Isn't that all that really matters? Bee Movie is harmless entertainment for the whole family. With a much appreciated 'message' about respecting all life (well sorta of), I find it hard to admit that Bee Movie's humor is low rank and dry, but at least we are spared the potty jokes typical of this genre. For harder laughs like myself, the film may feel a tad bit long, but I almost guarantee that younger ones will be thrilled. Which isn't to say that the writing aims mercilessly at cheap laughs and extreme levels of pop culture to get easy laughs. An interview from the Bee Movie cast revealed that the film started with a title, and that is no shock, seeing as the movie does deliver entirely from that premise. I found myself admiring the film's quirky unpredictable style. The film just goes anywhere and everywhere, you can practically see the guys responsible for the movie just having a good time between every plot turn. The film is to say the least, immensely unbelievable. You'll have to suspend your disbelief to the level of a Saturday morning cartoon, and sure more could have been done with this weak premise, but I feel the film should be congratulated for tackling such a strange storyline. The film is artless and the animation is just average, but don't go in expecting ""Toy Story"", bring your children, and you'll be fine. At least, any movie that can make a screening room full of children gasp in sadness when a bug gets stepped on is number one on my list."
26,Bee Movie,3,5 April 2008,Animated with not enough fun.,"If you like Jerry Seinfeld you'll like BEE MOVIE; if you don't...you won't. I'm in the latter camp, but watched to see what the hype was about. Barry B. Benson(Seinfeld)is a new graduate and must decide his future. Instead of being a worker bee with the same job everyday forever is not that appealing. He would rather be a pollen jock and go out into the world and collect nectar, but he knows that job is but a lofty dream for a young bee. Barry soars out into the world on his own and breaks one of the most important rules of beedom...he speaks to a human. He is saved from a bad situation by Vanessa Bloome(Renee Zellweger)a florist; and through that relationship Barry decides to sue the human race for manufacturing honey. Some pretty big named stars lend their voices: Chris Rock, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Kathy Bates, Rip Torn and Michael Richards."
27,Bee Movie,1,25 December 2007,Bee Gone,"Dreamworks should be embarrassed for creating a movie like this. It is a piece of junk. Compared to Ratatoullie or any Pixar film, it shows lack of detail, poor animation, and poor writing, making it one of the worst films ever created. The concept of a bee falling in love with a woman makes this film inappropriate for a child, and unappealing for a sane human. It is obvious quality was not a concern for Jerry Seinfield, but, an ineffective attempt at comedy. The storyline didn't cause you to relate to the characters, but left you as a bystander watching. Although, the concept of a bee suing humans over stolen honey is cute, it was poorly executed and didn't cause the audience to side with the bees. Many of the sets were inaccurate (like LAX and JFK) and not detailed. The movie looked like it was made by inexperienced animators with no artistic talent."
28,Bee Movie,1,3 November 2007,"After the one liners, they ran out of ideas","I had very low expectations for this movie. It failed to meet any of them. I heard an interview with Seinfeld saying that they went through 40 drafts. It looks like they forgot to pick one, instead they ended up with a disjointed mash up of one-liners mixed into stupid plot devices. Some of the one-liners were funny - laugh out loud funny, in fact. A 30-minute show could have covered those one-liners and contained the about nothing nature of the show, much the way the Seinfeld TV show did. I do not expect perfect science or good lessons from a cartoon, but this one has such flawed science, and such poor lessons that it was difficult to suspend disbelief. Not clever, not funny and I wish I could get my time and money back."
29,Bee Movie,1,13 March 2008,Worst Animated Movie EVER!,"If I could have picked a 0 out of 10, I would. I consider myself a bit of an animation connoisseur and I own well over 100 animated movies. I have just one question for everyone in Hollywood; Did anyone read this script before attaching themselves to the project? Seinfeld, Oprah, Zellwigger (sp?). This is like a case of the Emperor's new clothes. Nobody had the cajones to say ""Hey Jerry, this just isn't funny or even mildly entertaining..."" That's why Larry David is a writer and Jerry should stick to underage girls. But seriously, I actually walked out of this movie, and I NEVER do that. And the animation was mediocre, at best. The interns at Pixar could have done better with a FLASH program. I hate to bash, but this was just a huge disappointment! They must of spent all their money on marketing and McDonald's tie-ins. Please guys, you have some of the most talented people in Hollywood at the helm of this project, you can do A LOT better. And next time, don't just sign up because Jerry got you Knicks tickets, your audience expects more!"
30,Bee Movie,1,6 December 2007,Not good for kids,"Was that a kids movie i just saw? I went with my son, and unfortunately the guts of the movie was based in COURT. They could have had so much fun with the story line, but where do they take it??? to the most boring and UN-childlike place on the planet. Where have all the good movies gone? We need some bad guys, some adventure, and some fun! Kids wont enjoy it, maybe teenagers. The fact they shot winnie the pooh, maybe funny for adults who know that its just a joke, but for little kids who love winnie, HOW COULD THEY???? The jokes were not funny, i did however laugh a little at the end. If you are going to make a movie for kids, let your hair down, have some fun with it, and Don't bring in adult politics that kids shouldn't and don't want to watch in their movies."
31,Bee Movie,1,13 October 2008,bee movie has scarred me  for life,"This movie is by far the worst thing to come out since cats and dogs. I felt confused and disgusted throughout the whole bee experience. the dialect was dry and uninteresting. I was disturb by the fact a grown woman left her husband for a bee. Not only did this movie not have a plot , but it lacked any humor. seriously anyone who gives this movie any credit needs to get a life. obviously if you think bees flying planes or talking to humans is cute. the humans didn't even acknowledge the fact that they were talking to bees. they just went to court with them. yea thats really lame. know one wants to watch a movie about a girl and a bee in court making honey? my only question is how did this movie make theaters. I'm truly sorry for the people who have lost 8$. next time when you see a movie about bees and humans. Don't WATCH!"
32,Bee Movie,1,18 November 2007,"pathetic plot, not so great graphics","This movie is an absolute no no for anyone who has seen Finding Nemo and Cars. I only went to the theater to watch this movie because a female friend of mine and some others wanted to see the ""Bee movie"" instead of ""3:10 to Yuma"". Some scenes are funny, but hey I don't even remember them, and I just got back from the movie. I am a great fan of ""Cars"", although before watching the movie I had my bias towards the concept of cars talking and acting like humans. So, I tried to watch this movie without that bias, but it ended in several disappointing anticlimaxes. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie gets listed in the bottom of 3d animation movie lists. Why do they even try?"
33,Bee Movie,5,25 July 2008,Silly with an Absurd Storyline,"When the bee Barry B. Benson graduates from college, he finds that will have only one job for his entire life, and absolutely disappointed, he joins the team responsible for bringing the honey and pollination of the flowers to visit the world outside the hive. Once in Manhattan, he is saved by the florist Vanessa and he breaks the bee law to thank Vanessa. The become friends and Barry discovers that humans explore bees to sell the honey they produce. Barry decides to sue the human race, with destructive consequences to nature.""Bee Movie"" has a great animation, but unfortunately is silly with an absurd storyline. I do not understand what the writer might have in his mind with such lack of message; maybe a child could have written a better and more intelligent plot. The lead character in funny but has an annoying voice. I love animations, especially those with good messages. However, is so inaccurate and stupid that even for children I believe this movie does not work well. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Bee Movie  A História de Uma Abelha"" (""Bee Movie  The Story of a Bee"")"
34,Bee Movie,8,4 November 2007,Flawed but redeemed,"This is a very entertaining movie as expected from the cast list and the exceptional trailers, that showcased producer Seinfeld as a human bee and had a cameo appearance of the studio head, Steven Spielberg. A nonconformist bee graduates after the nine days of mandatory education from which he missed one. He is faced with choosing a job for life which only becomes available on the death of another bee in the very organised bee colony/hive. He is only interested in one job 'Pollen Jock' for which he has not qualified for on his breeding but gets to try and qualify for at the movie end.Because a human spares his life, he breaks the bee law of not speaking to humans, discovers that humans obtain honey from bee prison camps, and successfully sues humans to return all the stolen honey. This has effects that he could not have predicted.There are some biological errors on the role of bees in pollination that are redeemed by the final message of the interrelatedness of all species in nature.I particularly liked the irony of the bloodsucking mosquito's conversion to lawyer. This exemplifies the use of verbal and visual humour designed for the adult viewer."
35,Bee Movie,8,8 December 2007,2 Thumbs up to Seinfeld,"I really enjoyed Bee Movie. The role of Barry Benson was just made for Seinfeld, can't think of anyone better to be cast as the voice.Plenty of humor for the kids and adults alike. I thought the plot was going to be a bit thin in the middle, but the ending ties it up just nicely. Would have liked to hear more from Chris Rock though!Anyway, a very entertaining, light hearted film (even with a hint of a message about Ecosystem preservation for the kiddies). One of the better animated films after a long run of disappointments(except for Ratatouille). I'll be getting this one on DVD without a doubt. 8/10"
36,Bee Movie,10,22 April 2017,The best movie of all time,"I cried harder than when I binge watched the titanic, forest Gump, and toy story 3. I laughed more than I ever have since I saw this movie. It was like watching the birth of Christ . The animation rivals, no, demolishes that of the toy story series. If this movie was a theme park, It would rival the combined power of six flags and Disney world. If this movie were a martial artist, it could easily take Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, 2 v 1. This is truly the pinnacle of human achievement. Who needs Kylie Jenner and Pepsi when you have the living essence of Jesus Christ on your TV screen. Truly, nothing in the world can be as good as this"
37,Bee Movie,1,11 July 2011,Witless addition to the genre,"This pitiful exercise starts out as almost a carbon copy of 'Antz'. Playing the poor-man's Woody Allen again, Seinfeld's depiction of a Bee unsatisfied with his lot feels like a serious case of deja vu. In the hive Seinfeld's Bee character lives in an apartment with his stereotyped Jewish parents; obviously a bee's real parents are the Queen and a drone male who died after mating, so already it is just a stupid failure to educate kids on the basics of a beehive in the pursuit of a cheap laugh. Of course we know the only male bees in the hive are the drones who mate with the Queen then die. A male mosquito is also featured as a bloodsucker ... male mosquito's actually eat pollen: the females feed on blood. It really is a fundamental failure at giving kids something real or - even slightly - educational for the cheapest laughs possible.As the bee moves out into the world he meets Renee Zellweger's character. After a run-in with her boyfriend in the bathroom (where we get the term ""poo water"") she eventually takes him to a supermarket where he sees numerous jars of honey.The bee is outraged, and sues humanity, all bees on the planet go on strike as the honey is given back. No, really. Bees around the world stop pollinating plants and all the flowers start to die.Realizing what they have done, the pair collect a mass of flowers for the bees to pollinate and restart nature's cycle ... with one plane load of roses. Travelling on a jet airliner one of the more ridiculous scenes occurs when bees land the un-piloted plane.The laughs here are few and far between. One must suspend disbelief for movies like this but here it goes beyond stupidity. Is is supposed to be clever that bees have a version of Larry King? At the end the bee has become a lawyer and a pollen collector ... its just lame from beginning to end.For Jerry Seinfeld to come out of retirement for this utter drivel is really quite an embarrassment for him. Watch Antz instead or a Bug's Life for worthwhile entertainment. Avoid this like the plague."
38,Bee Movie,2,4 February 2009,Bee-Ware!,"When I watched Jerry Seinfeld dump on the Subway sandwich guy on his ""comeback"" appearance on David Letterman a couple of years back, it confirmed what I had always suspected -- that he is a mean, petty misanthrope (as is Letterman, for that matter). The scene between Barry and Bee Larry King proves that Seinfeld is an anti-Semetic Semite too boot! I was wondering how Barry knows so much about the world and humans without ever having been outside the hive before his trip with the Jocks until he informed Bee Larry that Human Larry is hunched-over, squinty-eyed and Jewish!Another alleged ""comic"" who clearly has utter contempt for his people is Chris Rock. Listening to how he voiced the mosquito reminded me of one of his ""routines"", a truly revolting diatribe comparing ""Negroes"" to ""N***ers"". Had a white actor voiced the mosquito that way, he'd be drummed out of the business!Even more idiotic than a man being jealous of a bee (don't get me started on a non-human practicing law!), why didn't Vanessa warn Barry of the ramifications of winning his suit? Yeah, I know she's a dingbat (proof that Seinfeld is also a raving misogynist!), but she knows what will happen to her floral business if bees don't pollinate (then again, maybe not). And why can't the bears sue Barry for slander and defamation? Too bad Sting and Ray Liotta can't sue Stink-feld for dumping on them!"
39,Bee Movie,8,23 May 2008,Terrific Animation but weak storyline!,"Jerry Seinfeld had one of the most successful television programs in history. Now, he returns as the voice of Barry Benson, a young bee, who graduates from Bee School with all Bees. All the bees in the hive work after they graduate from Bee School but in the same job for the rest of their lives with little time off to enjoy life. So one day, Barry manages to get out of the hive and experience the world out there. New York City never looked so good on television. He befriends Vanessa Bloome, the voice by Rene Zellweger, who is a florist after she stops her husband from killing him. The voices are first rate with top stars including Patrick Warburton, Matthew Broderick as Barry's best friend, Kathy Bates, and others as well. It's a great film for children but it gets boring and tiresome at some times. THe look is great but it's not perfect."
40,Bee Movie,1,15 November 2007,Terrible copy of Antz,"I was really astonished that the movie makers really dared to copy the entire movie ""Antz"" from 1998. They not only adapted the context of the film, but they also copied some scenes one to one. First, the story: A perfect working insect society, where everyone is happy to take his or her determined place, except for one. One Ant/Bee does not want to do the same labour for the rest of its life. Both insects decide to flee from their responsibility and try out a different live, not defined by society. Therefore Ant and Bee descide to leave their hive behind. While the Ant is becoming a hero by protecting the hive from an internal thread, the Bee is becoming a hero by protecting the hive from an external thread. But as you can see, apart from that, the plot does not really differ. While ""Antz"" entertained and really tried to incorporate the biology of ants in the movie, the ""bee movie"" abandoned everything about bee's, except their morphology and designed an industrial bee society, with cars, trucks, nectar-suction-plasma-injectors. Why the hell would bee's need cars??? Why does the Bee Barry B. Benson have a separate dad and mother??? Why aren't they working, although they claim that every bee will have to work 24/7? This all does not make sense in respect to bee biology and in respect to the films inner logic, which is far worse. I do not have troubles with fantastic movies, but when a movie starts to contradict its inner logic at several points, it just pisses me off. Because at the point I noted that nothing adds up in this movie, I realized that everything was created in order to boost merchandising. You can sell more, if the bee has a car, if the drones have nectar-suction-plasma-injectors, you can charge an extra of 4,99$. Watch ANTZ. Woodie Allan is far more funny in the role of the ant!!!!"
41,Bee Movie,1,11 April 2008,Forget the Death Penalty: Introduce the Bee Movie Penalty,"It's been a while since I acquired a headache from a movie. For that, I thank ""Bee Movie,"" a dreadfully mindless excursion into the worlds of both copycat kiddie fantasy and shameless commercial promotion (for a show that's been off the air for years).This was a movie I never even wanted to watch. So the disc was inserted without my blessing into a DVD player that should be praised for its patience at showing such garbage, and I was subjected to all 90 or whatever minutes of this trash festival. I was told I wouldn't even notice the nasal, whiny, someone-please-strike-him-mute voice of hack comedian Jerry Seinfeld (that's right, I said it, Seinfeld *and* his show are two of the most cruel things that can be unleashed upon mankind). Naturally, that was wrong.Basically, that meant that the movie was basically a rehash of movies like ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Antz,"" both of which were very good movies in which insects dreamed of a better life and had the fortitude to make it happen. That sentence should be its own genre by now! Even the actors I had genuine respect for (Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, and Larry Miller, the hilarious voice of the pointy-haired boss in ""Dilbert"") were unimaginably uninspiring. They had absolutely no shame, wasting what seemed like hours on jokes about rock star Sting. They even sank so low as to feature a character called ""Bee Larry King."" Next time, can we please get Dugong Dr. Phil a role in a ""Madagascar"" sequel?When a bee stings, it dies. It's a fact of biology. And this putrid bug corpse starts stinging the moment the disc drawer is closed."
42,Bee Movie,3,16 March 2008,Another Fail for Dreamworks,"First off, I would like to say that I usually love animated films. I really enjoy watching cartoons! I also really enjoy Sienfeld. I thought ""hey, maybe Bee Movie will be a great mix of the two!"" That was before I saw the movie.The movie starts well, with a promising story and colourful animation. Everything goes really well, and then . . . it just dies. A new plot shows up, and the rest of the film looks like the writers made a bunch of different movies with the same character and stuck their favourite scenes from each one in the actual film. For all I know, they could have actually done that. The story's all over the place, and half of the good jokes were in the preview. Sure it was still a funny movie, but that doesn't make it good. Nor does saying ""it's just a cartoon!"" justify the sloppy story, boring/predictable characters, or poor animation.Dreamworks has done it again: made another film to show Pixar is better than them."
43,Bee Movie,2,9 January 2008,Flat out  B For The Bee Movie,"OK Here we go again... this is another one of those mediocre-kindda funny-type of movie that shot a load off on the Big screen! This is a story of a bee... kindda hard to figure it out huh?! When I went to see this MOVIE yesterday, i was waiting for the break-out-and-laugh-till-you-die pitch-like dialogues and the likes... But I ended up waiting... and waiting... just waiting...Well, I expected too much out of this movie.. I mean it's Seinfeld for Christ's sake.. I mean, I thought that this movie will wash out all the others!! Because of the trailers, I was kindda dragged into seeing this.. well, I'm a sucker when it comes to trailers..In the theatre, I see lots of people are falling all over themselves with praise because this movie is cute, harmless, and not dirty. For goodness sake, folks, Winnie the pooh was shot!!! This is 2008! CG movies with cute characters are a dime a dozen. As consumers, we should express a desire for genuinely worthwhile, well thought, funny kids/CG movies. Otherwise, we will get more and more of this drivel, and worse. The only good point for Bee Movie, is that they did not descend into a bunch of toilet humor. On the other hand, the instances that you could call ""humor"" at all were few and far between.Anyway, I also heard that this movie was a rip-off!!! It's said that the bee movie was a pirated copy of Beebylon! Well, that's the rumor or it may seem that way...OK now, enough of me saying that this movie isn't a worth-to-watch type of movie.. well, this is just me, I mean, if you still want to watch this, well, then go ahead and watch it.. This is just a simple comment from a simple movie-goer...This Movie is a solid 2!"
44,Bee Movie,5,2 November 2007,Kids story told in an adult way (= disappointing),"When I heard that Jerry Seinfeld would do a DreamWorks computer animated movie I was truly worried. Would he be able to please both kids and adults with this one? Could he make a movie in the league of Shrek, Flushed Away, Shark Tale or even Sinbad or Spirit? But no. I just saw the movie and it disappoints on every level. The story is about the bee Barry (Seinfeld) who lives in a colourful hive. One day Barry breaks all the bee rules when he befriends a human lady named Vanessa (Renée Zellweger - great voice!). He discovers that humans steal their honey and takes our race to court. To his great luck Barry wins (my god, is that a spoiler?). But does that really make the bee race happy? Bee Movie starts in nice fashion. We see some beautiful images of the hive, which resembles a giant theme park. Well done. Probably for merchandise-sake the bees don't fly around. They actually use cars and television to get around and entertain themselves. Indeed, all those nice colourful items would make great toys. But that's cool. That's how the industry works.The first scenes in the open air are great. We see Barry fly over Central Park, getting smashed by a tennis racket and getting stuck in the engine of a car. I laughed. I was happy. But then the fun was over. From that point on most of the laughs come from one-liners by Seinfeld (and they're not that funny) and cameos that no 8 year old (certainly not the ones from Europe) will recognize. Larry King, Ray Liotta, Sting, Oprah Winfrey great that they found the time to cooperate. But is that really the way to make a funny movie? When the movie ended I asked myself: what went wrong? I guess it's this: Bee Movie is not a movie for children, nor adults. And that's why it's very much out of balance. Kids will understand the fact that bees are not happy that humans steal their food. But the action that follows is a battle with words (the scenes in court), instead of something more visual and action-oriented. If I had taken my ten year old to see this movie, he would have been asleep after 30 minutes.I have no doubt the adults will be disappointed too. Kids lie awake at night wondering why the humans steal the honey, because that fits in their fantasy world. But as an adult I couldn't care less. So what if they're angry? What are they going to do about it anyway? If an audience can not identify with the problems or quest of the main character, the story will become quite uninteresting. And that's what happens here. Bee Movie is a kids story told in an adult way. That's why it doesn't work. It took four years to make the movie. In that time Jerry Seinfeld could've made 4 x 24 = 96 television shows, let's say 96 x 25 = 2400 minutes of probably great entertainment. Instead, he delivers some 85 minutes of this. What a bummer!"
45,Bee Movie,1,22 April 2008,My 6-year old son was upset by WinnieThe Pooh and Grandma scenes and wanted to write this comment,"My son and I watched the Bee Movie yesterday and we did not like it. We were shocked to see bad things in a child's movie. My son did not like when they shove the grandma's head down at gun point and he especially was upset the following day about the scene where Winnie-the-Pooh gets shot with a tranquilizer. We thought he was killed. It was very very upsetting to my son who loves Winnie-the-Pooh and piglet too. (He cried for a couple of hours and wouldn't stop talking about why they treated Winnie-the-Pooh that way.) We are ashamed of the makers of this movie. We will not tell our friends to watch it. It gets a thousand thumbs down! As a mother, it was upsetting to see not only these violent scenes in a child's movie but also the inappropriate sexual comments. This is not a child's movie."
46,Bee Movie,7,9 November 2007,Witty but flawed structure,"The Bee Movie is very verbal and witty and the premise is cute if not novel. However it never resolves the main issue of beekeeping. Instead it paints beekeepers as evil thieving villains without morals or scruples and even manages to play the race card. It does a good job of coming full circle and educating young viewers of the important role that bees play in the food chain however it never goes back to the beekeepers, a fact which plays way down to every viewer. The movie revolves around a hive of wild bees and never instructs us in the difference between wild bees and domesticated bees, which are the ones that beekeepers tend, transport and care for. Domesticated bees are the bees civilizations have relied upon for thousands of years for crop yield, feeding the planet, etc., etc. Wild bees are good only for, well, bears and other varmints that are dumb enough to wrastle with them for the sake of their sweet tooths. Even Indians and primitive man calmed wild bees with smoke to get the honey. It's kind of like a cartoon movie about a wild mustang in the desert wanting to free all the domesticated horses in the world in the 1800's. Taking honey from a hive does not kill the bees or kill the hive. The movie presents disingenuous and unwarranted disinformation."
47,Bee Movie,10,23 February 2008,Sainfeld do it again,"I voted 10 - yes ten! I recognized all of Sainfeld's jokes in the whole movie. That guy is amazing. Smart jokes and mature comment's that i think make this movie good for a more grown up audience. I love the details of the bee world. Everything is organized and great looking. The 3D world is simply amazing. I've seen the movie twice and looked closely at many details. The colors, the ""feeling"", the music...i can't imagine the amount of work for this project. I will be so happy for a second part of this. The main character is funny and interesting even he is just a small bee. In this violent world we live, these kind of movies are well received. Genius minds @ work :) GO SAINFELD!"
48,Bee Movie,10,1 March 2017,best film,"This is literally the most wonderful thing I've seen thus far in my otherwise dull and pathetic life. Pls watch for incredible human-bee bonding and riveting court drama. 10/10 would definitely watch again. Definitely better than the Shawkshunk Redeption and that film with Liam Neeson where he can't find his daughter. And what's that one with Alan Rickman where he's a bit evil, but not in a Snape way. Die Hard. Just like the critics of this movie."
49,Bee Movie,10,21 February 2017,Unbelievable Movie of our generation of all time,"I did not have high expectations of this movie first going in. But than after the first second of this movie, my mind was blown, like my mind being blown off like a shotgun pointed at me, like an ISIS execution, where they have a chainsaw at my neck. This movie was like watching the birth of Christ himself, even though I am not religious, I would become Christian. To anyone who hasn't seen the Bee Movie, stop what you're doing and watch this movie immediately."
50,Bee Movie,1,10 November 2007,Really boring,"I wanted to enjoy this movie. I really did. But this truly bores me out. heard that Jerry Seinfeld was making a movie, I thought it would be funny. Now the producers probably think it is funny that they scammed a lot of people for their money just by putting Seinfeld on the show.The biggest problem here was the believability. I have a big imagination and I can accept almost anything that I watch, but this really pisses me off. The whole story is that the bees don't like people taking their honey so Berry(Seinfeld) takes them to court and sues humans. Now, I've seen lots of animation and the characters are rarely human so I easily accepted that bees could talk here. The thing that really annoyed me was the fact that they went to court. That just bored me away and I'm sure it did to a lot of other people too. Very few movies were successful that focused about life in court, and the ones that made it were serious movies, not jokes. The justice system and jokes don't mix well, and this is more than enough proof for that.Now, if this movie went a different way, it might have worked. It had a good idea, but expressed it in a very bad way. In my opinion, it would have been a lot better if instead of suing humans in court, they just stung them until they stopped taking honey. Would have made it much more believable and this movie might have actually been good.So my final note for all Directors and other people thinking about making a movie or show. The justice system is serious and jokes are funny. They don't mix. At all."
51,Bee Movie,8,2 November 2007,Seinfeld's back. In bee form!,"I must admit, I didn't catch the 'B' movie reference as soon as I should have. This didn't keep it from being a hilarious and entertaining 'A' romp in CG land. Seinfeld's character, Barry Bee, has an inquisitive side that is atypical for a Honex employee. He loves his fellow bees but, once exposed to life outside the hive, finds he can also sympathize with other noble creatures like humans. I found it to be terribly funny with a boatload of adult references that the kids in the audience missed (Barry to Bee Larry King, ""How old *are* you?"" and many others), but they were too engrossed in all the slapstick crashing, splatting and flying through car engines to care. Nice message of pride in your work and cooperation woven in to boot. A slick funfest appropriate for all ages, and no rude humor to speak of. I will own this one."
52,Bee Movie,1,3 November 2007,Pure Torture!,"By far the worst children's movie I have ever had to experience. I knew it was going to be bad, but I was out voted 6 to 2 (mostly kids in our group).The jokes, if that is what you want to call them were predictable and I couldn't bring myself to feign a fake smile.The story was awful, a lazy bee striving for idleness. Great message for the kids, why work when you can be a bum?We all ended up very disappointed. The concessions were the only consolation, at least we ended up with refreshments.Not even worth renting. BAAAAAD!"
53,Bee Movie,9,17 April 2008,a great family movie,"I just saw this a few weeks ago, and I was entertained throughout. The great voice talent, which includes Jerry Seinfield and Chris Rock, and the great animation don't begin to state how great this is. This has got to be the best Dreamworks movie EVER!The movie is split up into 3 parts. The first part is an easy-going slow-paced story about Barry Benson and his friend Adam and their adventures(and sometimes misadventures...). The middle is the courtroom scene. This is where the action starts to heat up. The end...well, I'm not telling that part.This was a great movie. My only complaint is that the courtroom scene was dragged on too long. But overall, a great movie for kids and adults alike. Great scripting and great casting make this great."
54,Bee Movie,6,1 November 2007,You know it's not going to be bad...,"It's Jerry Seinfeld for crying out loud, he only does gold! You've seen the commercials, trailers and advertisements: ""Bee Movie is a hit"". Come on, what did you expect? Hopefully nothing less than, ""yeah it was pretty funny"". That's what all these animated movies are like. How can you judge one above the other? There have been so many to this point, it's like they're all the same.Bee Movie is a cute little movie about the life of working bees that come across a corporation selling their honey. Jerry Seinfeld's character Barry decides to talk to the humans, and once he discovers the ""stealing"" of the honey, he starts a lawsuit against the humans... this can only be animated. Come on! It's cute!! Although this movie shares similar qualities with other animation films, I did notice one thing that most animated films don't have: adult humor. Yes, it's true; it's rated PG for a reason. This film is the best of both worlds because it has both the funny little immature things that kids crave, but also humorous one-liners that adults will appreciate. I loved that about this movie, it was actually very funny.6 out of 10 for my taste. Yes, it's the same movie as every other animated movie. It's only goal is to make money, and it WILL be successful. However, the plot was satisfactory, characters were very submissive and once again, Jerry's one-liners killed. Try to take notice of the little things. For only being 90 minutes, this movie is worth your time if you want a few good laughs. I hope you all enjoy."
55,Bee Movie,8,12 December 2007,A funny and clever effort from Jerry Seinfeld,"There's something about animated insects that seems to attract popular big-city comedians for some reason. New York's Woody Allen lent his familiar voice to Antz with slightly embarrassing results. A couple of months later, Mark Foley, from Toronto's ""Kids in the Hall"" troupe, played the lead in Pixar's A Bug's Life, succeeding rather well. However, unlike Allen and Foley, both of whom were hired after story completion, DreamWorks' Bee Movie was sitcom star Jerry Seinfeld's project from the very beginning. The film features his usual charm and wit and as is able to succeed without going through the ""off-colour adult humour"" route that seem to be plague modern animated productions.Like other animated films about talking bugs, Bee Movie portrays its title heroes as human-like, showing a close-up at the hive and comparing the two different species rather comically. Bees are shown as using honey for hygiene, flying as the equivalent of running and graduating university in a grand total of three days. Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld), however, is less than enthralled about having the same job for the rest of his life, despite the excitement of his best friend Adam (Matthew Broderick). Barry decides to fly out of the hive and explore the outside world. After being saved by a human florist (Renee Zellweger), he befriends her and soon finds out that humans have been eating honey for decades. In response, Barry sues the human race and the honey factories are shut down. Unfortunately, things don't become as cheery as Barry had planned.To put it simply, Barry is essentially Jerry Seinfeld in bee form. He constantly tells jokes wondering the reason for certain things and he plays off other characters very well. Zellweger gives an almost Elaine Benes vibe in her performance as the florist and this leads to some humorous moments between her and Barry, creating a relationship almost akin to that of Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. The other actors do rather well, too. Matthew Broderick once again plays the straight man and voice-of-reason with a calm feel, while John Goodman puts on a humorous Sourthern accent for his role as an insect-hating lawyer. Seinfeld also rounds up celebrity cameos from Ray Liotta (who is able to lampoon himself with a little help from the animators), Larry King and Sting. Chris Rock also provides the film's funniest line as a blood-starved mosquito.Bee Movie also proves to be a rather winning social commentary on the legal system and how suing shouldn't necessarily be the answer to everything. There are also some funny jokes on inter-racial marriage and airport regulations. That's for the adults. For the younglings, this film is funny for them as well, mixing colourful animation with some physical comedy and roller-coaster-ride sequences. Harry Gregson-Williams' bouncy score also adds to the charisma and fun of the production. Insect biologists will probably cry fowl regarding the film's inaccuracies, like how it shows both male and female bees making honey (although, like the human world, both genders are probably equal in the workplace) as well as forgetting the fact that only female mosquitoes suck blood. However, the film is so entertaining and so funny, that these can be overlooked. Overall, Seinfeld has made Bee Movie just as intelligent and funny as even Pixar's productions."
56,Bee Movie,1,18 February 2011,there are 1001 b-films better written and funnier than this bee-film,"i just spent one dollar on this movie and feel ripped off.the humor is less than funny. in the whole movie my wife laughed once (why is yogurt night so difficult) which is once more than i laughed. the sexual humor was more disturbing than funny, and there were multiple racist jokes (from a kids movie, really!?) the plot jumps from point to point without guiding you or having rhyme or reason to any of it. nothing in the movie made any sense. it's not like you miss anything either, there was nothing there to get in the first place.i know it is an animated movie about talking bees, but there seems to be little knowledge of the real world presented in the movie, as if the writers looked up bees on wikipedia, did a quick summary and tried to write a movie.if i can warn just one person to stay away from this ATROCITY of a film, this review will have been worth my time."
57,Bee Movie,1,4 December 2009,Bee-fore you watch this horrible movie,"This movie is unbeelievably awful. All-star cast, heavy advertising, followed by possible beestiality? Not good. I like Seinfeld; however, this involves none of the witty, sarcastic, nor acerbic humor you may expect. This movie is flat-out awful. I'm no animated movie enthusiast, but I do seem to enjoy every other one I have seen, with this as the sole exception. From the beginning, you can tell this movie had no idea where it would go.These animated movies just do not work when you mix insect and human interactions. Pick one side or the other, don't go with a premise of bees bee-coming buddies with humans, bee-cause it falls flat on its face. It's just not honey. I mean funny.Bottom line, this movie Bee-lows."
58,Bee Movie,1,23 May 2012,Possibly the worse high budget 3D Movie ever.,"The fact that this was funded by many people still makes it hard to conceive, it tries so hard to have a plot and then just fails miserably considering it's plot is of a Bee loving a human. Now i simply hate to see when people try to pull off stuff like this in a movie, or in any media related form of art possible. For Example: Sonic 2006, with the Princess and Sonic the Hedgehog thing going on. The ending is all around a excuse to show that bees are useful and the fact that they use a bad female version of a Beatles song doesn't help to make it FEEL like something good, it just rots horribly and stinks like a dead corpse. Kind of like a bad cheese of some sort... I don't why i'm trying to compare it with food but i just wanted to say something witty and memorable. I'm sorry but i can't even put effort into this review considering of the fury of the fact that it simply SO BAD. The fact that it's written by Jerry Seinfeld doesn't surprise me, the humor is bland as hell and the only thing that the movie has gone to coming funny is pretty much puns related to bugs which are pretty much overused allot and Jerry must be in hes little corner thinking ""HAHA oh man i added Bee to a famous actor! How GENIUS!"". And that's another thing that i hate about this movie, the cultural references. It's like they keep showing every time, and I MEAN allot, that they simply ran out of ideas and i don't blame them one bit, to make a idea of a movie simply about bees and the abuse of bee work is insane. Why would you make a VEGAN propaganda to insects? Sorry to compare this to A bug's Life (which is a insanely better movie, but one of Pixar's most forgettable) but that is a good bug 3d movie done right, considering it compares the Ant colony and grasshopers to a social commentary of some sort, and that's kind of deep. This movie on the other side? Simply shows: ""Bees doing bees stuff, HUMANS RUIN BEES!!! UMMM... BEES IN A JUSTICE COURT! MOSQUITO IS LAWYER, Suddenly HUMANS UNDERSTAND BEES AND STUFF!"". I know Dreamworks movies keep on using these these flaws most of the time during there movies but considering i came from the future and just watched there new movies such as Puss and Boots and How to Train a Dragon, they learned how to drop the cultural reference and focus on plot, characters and beautiful action scenes. This is on the other side... Is possi-BEE(How ironic to use a pun in this review)one of Dreamwork's WORSE and brings a example of how bad Dreamwork can be.This movie just just keeps buzzing in my ear like a annoying bee. I do not recommend it and there are much better films to enjoy or watch with your children, Puss in Boots as i gave a example. That made my young sister feel so happy unlike this bore fest where she simply keeps asking questions during the entire movie such as ""Why is this so bad?""."
59,Bee Movie,2,14 October 2011,What a shame,"""Bee Movie"" was a huge disappointment for me. Jerry Seinfeld is one of my favorite comedians, and after seeing the first live-action previews from this animated movie, I was expecting this to be (At least) funny...Sadly, ""Bee Movie"" ended being just a lame and uninspired animated film, that fails spectacularly at every single level.Even when I was expecting that this movie would be at the same level of comedies such as ""Seinfeld"", this still managed to disappoint me, mostly because it's incredibly unfunny. There wasn't any single funny joke or scene in this movie: Most of the story feels forced and dumb, the ""message"" feels shoehorned and fake (And, to be honest, it seems like it was added at the last moment) Even the very few attempts to include ""adult"" or ""mature"" humor feel way too stupid and annoying to be remotely funny.The animation is mediocre at best. Compared with some of the previous movies from Dreamworks (Such as ""Shrek"" or ""Over the Hedge"") it looks pretty bad. The characters designs are ugly and unappealing (Even ""Madagascar"" had a better character design) Along with ""Shark Tale"", ""Bee Movie"" is one of the weakest movies from Dreamworks, being a boring, dumb and poorly made film, with a terrible story.The less said about this film, the better."
60,Bee Movie,5,24 December 2007,Once you click into the vibe you can pretty much guess the plot line and punchlines,"Clever but not that well done animated film from Jerry Seinfeld.The premise is that Jerry is a bee who on his first day at work end up being saved by Renee Zellweger. Wanting to be polite he does what a bee should never do, he talks to her to say thank you. They become friends. When he sees jars of honey in the store he sues humankind in order to get it back.Well animated, this is essentially a 90 minute Seinfeld routine that is all puns on bees. Its amusing, with some hysterical gags, but mostly its all obvious once the story gets going. Its a sketch stretched out almost to the breaking point. I didn't hate it, but after 15 minutes I was ready to get up and move to another theater.(Had I had a TV remote the channel would have changed). What really irked me was the way some of the voice cast was put into the film. The lines of say Ray Liotta seem to have been lifted from other sources and then dropped into the film. Other characters seem to have been recorded alone (which they probably were) and then spliced badly with the other voices so that everyone seems to be speaking all alone. There are odd gaps between lines of dialog as if robots with no sense of how conversations go together put it together.Its not bad but I paid 11 bucks and spent 90 minutes seeing this? Wait for cable"
61,Bee Movie,2,3 November 2007,pass on this one,"Okay, I'll start out by saying that I'm in my 20s, but I love watching kids movies. This one, however, sucked. I don't get it because I think Jerry Seinfeld is funny and there are a ton of talented people behind this movie, but there was literally only one line in the movie that made me smile (the Chris Rock line towards the end). I knew it was going to be political when I walked into it, and that didn't bother me at all, but it just wasn't funny. Most of the theater was fully of kids, including my 10-year-old cousins, and they didn't laugh either. It seems like they cut out a lot of stuff to make it a shorter movie, which just made it miss the mark.Bottom line: save your money and skip this one."
62,Bee Movie,5,1 November 2007,Bee Movie Movie Review,"Jerry Seinfeld has been away from the spotlight for some time now and 2007 marks the year of his return - but only as a voice in a computer animated film. While the premise is unique, the approach is generic, and the excellently animated, poorly executed family film will have difficulty avoiding the already popular classification that Bee Movie is indeed a B-movie.Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) is an average bee approaching adulthood, who must decide upon a job in the hive. The catch is that once he chooses his job, he must keep it for the rest of his life. Unsatisfied with the monotony of working in the hive, he ventures outside where he meets a human woman, Vanessa (Renée Zellweger), who saves his life. Indebted, he breaks the Cardinal bee rule: never talk to humans. At first Vanessa has difficulty accepting the talking bee, but the two soon spend quite a bit of time together and Barry gets overly comfortable as she reveals that she is a florist. Enamored with Vanessa, despite the interspecies barrier, Barry learns that humans have been stealing honey from bees and selling and eating it. Infuriated, he sets out to sue the honey company, with the help of Vanessa and his bee pals.Apparently bees drive cars, they are all cousins, and they can use their antennas as cell phones. The comical world the creators have devised for the bees is perhaps the most creative aspect of the film. Many parallels reside with Barry's rebellious teen years and human childhood, as specifically referenced by a sensationally hysterical homage to The Graduate. From voting the queen bee into monarchy, to pollination, to insects on windshields and their attraction to lights, many of the typical insect behaviors are addressed and translated into humorous gags - supposedly their thinking is shockingly similar to humans.The animation (from Dreamworks, the studio that brought us Shrek) as always continues to excel in its realism, from the cartoon movements and facial expressions of the characters, to the nearly flawless reflections and refractions of the inanimate objects and background environments. Barry gets stuck to a tennis ball and batted around in slow motion, and sucked into the engine of a car: both scenes and many more are executed with amazing editing and stunning camera movement that can only be achieved in computer animation.Hysterical character designs and voice acting also add to the fun, with jocose performances by John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, Chris Rock and even voice cameos by Michael Richards (who many joked would play the role of an Africanized bee) and Larry King as Bee Larry King. What doesn't work as well is the execution of the story. The film often contradicts itself with the reactions of the humans to talking bees, and with what Barry is capable of realistically doing as nothing more than a heavily personified insect. Some of the jokes elicit laughter, but most are on an unexpectedly low intelligence level, and ultimately the many entertaining bits are specifically aimed at younger audiences. As is often with computer animated films, visual perfection oftentimes overshadows the time spent trying to devise an enticing story, and Bee Movie falls in with the too-kid-friendly films that are quickly forgotten.Mike Massie"
63,Bee Movie,3,12 November 2007,What a disappointment!,"Oh for the days when animated movies could be enjoyed by the whole family. Not only was this movie boring, it didn't even follow the science of bees! It had it's moments. The bee stuff was almost reasonable. As soon as the humans came into it the story completely derailed. A courtroom scene in a kids' movie? Come on! No chemistry, no story, little humor, and a completely ignorant and inaccurate portrayal of the bees' place in the world means I will not be taking my nieces and nephews to see this film. They had a great opportunity to subtly explain the importance of pollination, the way all life is intertwined, even the workings of capitalism, but instead they decided to take the oh-so-popular stand that humans are bad for the planet. It rates a three because I did laugh a few times and I didn't walk out in disgust."
64,Bee Movie,3,12 March 2008,"As of yet, the worst 3-D animated film I have ever seen. Awful.","I came into this film completely open-minded. I was ready for anything. What I received was an incredibly unfunny, lazy movie that really does fail on almost every level. I am a huge fan of Jerry Seinfeld, his antics amuse me very much, but it's hard to contemplate that that stand-up genius was even involved with this trash.I won't bore you (or myself) with the plot details, I'll just say that a group of homeless people could write a better script. Even I could. This film is insulting to whatever it's target audience is, and the sudden crazy plot turns, as well as jokes that just fall flat on their face definitely contribute. Even the animation is a huge letdown.Am I exaggerating? Well, I guess you'll have to judge for yourself, but in the meantime, ask the 80 or so people who didn't bother to come watch it in the cinemas. Honestly, you could almost hear crickets; which I must say, would be a lot more interesting to hear than a stupid independent bee and his stupid movie. I usually avoid bad films, and I was shocked to find out that this is pretty much the worst film I have ever seen in a cinema. Honestly, don't watch it.3/10."
65,Bee Movie,3,11 November 2007,This movie ate my brain,"It had tiny moments of brilliance, both in the writing and the animation (The homage to ""The Graduate"" swimming pool scene was genius) but overall the movie as a whole was disjointed and sloppy. It started well, but really felt like they made up the final 2/3rds as they went along. Never paying off good story and comedic seeds planted earlier. It is all over the road, swerving from life choices, to human interaction adventure, to courtroom drama, to love story, to chase movie, to disaster flick, to environmental moral story. Pick something and stick with it!My kid & I enjoyed the occasional jokes and gags, but compared to a well-written animation feature such as Ratatouille, Bee Movie just doesn't stack up. I'f I ever meet Mr. Seinfeld, I'm asking for my money back."
66,Bee Movie,4,3 November 2007,Disappointing,"As an avid and faithful Seinfeld fan I could not miss this film...but I must say my wife and I were the only adults in the theater not accompanied by children under the age of 7. I soon learned why! This animation turned out to be cute for kids but the jokes were totally over their heads and rarely funny. The concept of mean adults exploiting bees was probably a shock to the kiddies and some may never eat honey again. And what's with shooting Pooh with a tranquilizer dart? Does he recover? Come on Jerry, you can do better!!! Adults, save your money. I give the animation a 5, the comedy a 3! This kind of reminds me of the last few TV episodes which lost their steam and relied on replays of the old routines to conjure up laughs."
67,Bee Movie,2,9 February 2008,Someone's been sniffing the A-grade pollen!,"Whatever it was that they were taking when they came up with Bee Movie, I suggest you have some before watching; it'll make the experience less painful.I've seen some weird films in my time, from the surreal output of Lynch, Miike and Jodorowsky, to the visual excesses of Argento and Gilliam, but I've never seen a film quite as strange as this effort from Dreamworks (whose standards have really been slipping as of late).A kids movie that features talking bees and cows, hints at interspecies sex, mentions suicide pacts, features lengthy courtroom scenes and a freaky dream sequence in which the heroine dies, and ends with thousands of bees helping a jumbo jet to land (!!!), Bee Movie is an unbelievable stinker of monumental proportions, albeit (or should that be 'all-bee-it?') one that keeps you watching purely to see what the hell they'll come up with next.The story starts off with a bee questioning his role in society, turns into a bizarre (or should that be 'buzz-arre'?) love story, becomes (or should that be....alright, I'll stop now) a quest for truth, warps into a courtroom drama, and ends up as a race against time with the fate of the Earth at stake.With barely a laugh to be had (not including those nervous giggling noises that I made as I felt my sanity sliding slowly away from me), I left this film questioning what kind of idiot green-lighted this train-wreck of a project.Bee Movie narrowly escapes getting a 1 out of 10 thanks to its dazzlingly colourful CGI, the very occasional genuinely inspired joke (the bee repeatedly hitting the window, the bugs on the windshield), and the smokin' hot female character, Vanessa (only pixels, I know... but WHAT pixels!!!)."
68,Bee Movie,3,13 December 2007,It had to happen eventually,"I've enjoyed every major computer animated Pixar and Dreamworks film that I've seen since, well, Toy Story. However, the honeymoon (no pun intended) is over.This tripe is lacking in almost every regard. The story is completely inane. It's moralistic bullshit from the get-go. Of all food industries to criticise, honey is probably one of the least deserving.The jokes are all at best old, more often just not fun. The only thing this movie has going for it is pretty colours and a few visual gags that are quite funny. Perhaps this is the beginning of when computer animated movies will suffer all the bad points of regular (children's) comedies. I sure hope not."
69,Bee Movie,3,8 November 2007,"Expected more, received even less","I went to this movie with my family last week. I was told by a friend that it was great, and I have always been a fan of movies like Toy Story, Bugs Life, etc.I am also a fan of Jerry Seinfeld, so I really had some expectations good expectations for this movie.This move was funny in a few places and started out stronger than it ended. In fact the last 30 minutes are painful to sit through.The sad part is that they took a great idea, and a strong opening and lost it in silly court room scenes that weren't funny, a Rose Bowl heist that was made no sense, and ended with nothing more than a political message on living green.It is evident that this is not an ""A"" movie, or even a ""B"" movie. I would say that it is like a ""C-"" to ""D+"" movie at best.Save your money and rent it, watch the first 45 minutes, then call it a day."
70,Bee Movie,1,26 May 2008,Inter-species breeding propaganda,"I'm fortunately filter all what my children are watching (you should do the same) and I enjoy very much the animated movies of all sort.The BEE MOVIE is an horror movie, after the GMO food and the new law in Britain which allow research with mixing human and animals cells , we have this : the story is truly boring and lame but we have for the first time a love story between a woman and a male bee (with explicit comments) , what is the point of this ..., I could not watch it to the end.Totally not for our children, boycott this crap, avoid it at all cost , but no, watch it to see this disgusting Inter-species breeding propaganda , but save your poor children from it."
71,Bee Movie,1,14 December 2007,Dreamworks wanna be Disney!,"Logically... that stupid movie try to defeat the Marvelous Disney Stories, in fact...that movie can be counted at the rest of the stupid Dreamworks movies that i ever seen...Logically... that movie STEALED the Pixar Style... when i saw the girl... i thought that was from Disney... but is what they want that we think.The only movie that was just good... was Shrek... but i still think that is a stupid movie... as a result.... we now have 4, 5 shrek movies!...Just go to the Movie Theater and only Watch Disney Staff!... don't waste your money with Bee Movie"
72,Bee Movie,3,11 November 2007,Huh?,"I can not believe this was made into a movie. The concept I guess is good enough but the story. ugh. it reminded me of when we were kids and each kid will add a new line to the story. that's how this film is. it was slapped on together to make a movie that is so corny and has no sense whatsoever. first barry graduates and doesn't want to work in the the hive doing boring work. so he goes out to be a bum and found himself a project to sue humans for taking honey. and unbelievably they won. so all honey is returned to them. now all bees don't want to work. all flowers die. so barry goes to retrieve the last remaining flowers to revive the dead flowers. he does this through a plane which is carried by bees! so that's successful now the bees are back collecting honey. and all flowers live. now barry's job is to be a pollen/honey collector. which is what he wanted to be in the first place! so all the drama was for nothing. i mean if he wanted to be this pollen/honey collector, the story could have evolved to something more meaningful instead of this. this is a waste of time and money."
73,Bee Movie,9,4 November 2007,Bee Movie - Be Happy!,"""It's gold, Jerry, gold!"" We looked forward to seeing Bee Movie for months, and we were not disappointed. I expected a 'different' kind of story-line from Seinfeld, and, sure enough, the plot included an interesting twist involving bees, a courtroom, and nefarious humans. It seemed to me that the writers took pain to explain (in a comical manner) the intricacies of the bee world, which might enlighten the kiddies somewhat. You don't get that in 'Shrek' or 'Cars', even if those flicks offer a few more belly laughs. I'll trade that off any old time for a film that stimulates the interest of the young ones.I found the movie more 'witty' than hilarious. Seinfeld has surprised me in the past by turning out a show that I didn't 'get' completely the first time - but later I did. There are also a lot of little things going on that only occur to you after a few viewings.Bee movie benefited from some speedy pacing, nifty animation & special effects, fine delivery by Seinfeld, and a great 'performance' by Renée Zellweger. More and more very talented 'acting' is being displayed in animated films these days (wonder, then, if we'll ever see Matthew McConaughey try his hand in this genre?)..All in our Sunday matinée audience had a great time. By the way - 'Bee Movie' and 'Game Plan' were the only 'family' movies at our theater - but there were three 18A gory, violent, obscenity-filled flicks. No PG-13 at all. Thank you, Jerry Seinfeld. Critics: haven't you got a more important job to do?"
74,Bee Movie,8,2 January 2008,Buzzingly brilliant!,"Yes, you read right, this is buzzingly brilliant! You may prefer this to just about every film you've seen released by Dreamworks in CGI!! :-) That's how good it is! Sure, it may be protesting against honey and poses a message that you don't have to follow, but haven't we had enough of that (on the other hand you may never think of honey in the say way again!)!? All these animated and children's films with good messages - YAAWWN!! We needed something more like this and guess what - we received it!! Anyway, this is the story about a bee named Barry who, instead of choosing a job, goes out into the outside world to see if he would like to be a pollen collector. In the mix-up he gets caught up in a game of tennis and buzzes into lots of scrapes before he reaches the house of an insect lover, who saves his life. Barry is determined to break the bee law of never talking to humans and thanks the woman for saving his life! They become very good friends and more adventures follow...Good for bee lovers of all ages and people who don't mind honey cut out of their lives, enjoy this funny, entertaining, well-done film, ""Bee Movie""! :-)"
75,Bee Movie,8,4 November 2007,What's the deal with bees not flying in the rain? Jever notice?,"Back in olden times, a B movie was one that was filmed largely on the backlot of a particular studio - that is, the kind of movie that had few, if any, known actors and that received little, if any, real promotion or hype. These were low budget, low-impact movies.But the similarity between those B movies and Bee Movie is purely nominal. Look! Big stars! Lots of hype? Is it worth the 90 minutes of your time to put up with a theater full of squealing youngsters, even if you yourself have no children and in fact are quite conspicuous? Short answer - yes! Jerry Seinfeld (who also co-wrote) is Barry B. Benson, a worker bee who just wants to fly away from the hive and see what's out there in the great big world; he doesn't want to be tied down to the same ol' monotonous job with Honex, making honey. Which is what bees do. No, he wants to fly, explore, live! His best pal Adam (Matthew Broderick), is a bit more conservative and openly embraces the long, dull office job that awaits him, and he tries in vain to dissuade Barry from acting on his dreams. Ah, but to no avail; once Barry flies out with the Pollen Jocks, bees who, well, collect the pollen the bees use to make honey, he sees those dreams fulfilled. But such a journey isn't a cakewalk, nosir, it's fraught with danger, as Barry gets caught in a car's engine, along with other mishaps, eventually finding his way to a windowsill outside the apartment of one Vanessa Bloome (Rene Zellweger), who saves him from being splattered by her friends.So it's your typical bee-meets-girl movie. Oh yes, I went there for that silly pun.Now, things are tough enough for Barry as he tries to win over Vanessa while jousting (verbally and physically) with her beau, Ken (Patrick Warburton, who's terrific as always) and dealing with his overprotective and not-completely understanding parents (Kathy Bates and Barry Levinson) when he learns that - gasp! - humans EAT honey. Honey that the bees make! After a little investigating, Barry sees with his own eyes how honey is harvested by humans from manmade hives populated by drugged-out bees - and he decides to sue the human race for stealing the bees' honey! And what had been a quirky love story (look! interspecies romance!) now becomes a little-man-versus-the-big-conglomerate plot line, and to tell the truth I felt a little guilty siding with the little guy. Barry takes the major corporations to court, and they're represented by the oleaginous Layton T. Montomgery (John Goodman), who lays on the good-ol-boy thicker than, well, you can guess. Can Barry and the bees stand up to Monty and the humans? With Oprah Winfrey as the judge, how can he go wrong? But wrong he does go, and that's as far as I'll take this plot summary.Bee Movie is everything you want to see in an animated movie. It's inventive and creative (check out how detailed the hive operations are, or even Vanessa's apartment, or the courtroom), it's believable, and it's utterly charming. An animated movie HAS to be charming, too, because otherwise we adults would see it as just some dopey kids movie, wouldn't we? Seinfeld is winning and sincere as the bee with a cause, even when - especially when - things don't work out the way he expects them to. Bee Movie has a lot of heart, with a perfect, cheery ending."
76,Bee Movie,5,1 October 2008,"Decent for the first half, then goes thud","Bee Movie starts out pretty cute. Lots of cute little bee-related jokes (like the accelerated living caused by their short life span) and a nice looking honey factory. It's got a standard story in which the odd-bee-out searches for meaning in the universe and explores the outside world.Unfortunately the movie is dumber than your typical cartoon, something that becomes apparent when the protagonist starts conversing with humans. This is silly in itself, but the movie becomes increasingly absurd.Now, cartoon's are usually absurd, but unfortunately this one fails to work. It's a very stupid story, and the rule is, the stupider the story, the funnier the movie needs to be to justify sitting through that stupidity. But the reverse happens with Bee Movie; the dumber it gets, the less funny it gets.It feels as though they came up with a poor premise and instead of scrapping it decided they would just struggle along and make the movie anyway.I enjoyed this movie to just about the halfway point. And then it started really annoying me. After another ten minutes, I couldn't take it anymore and started fast forwarding through looking for something funny. I got the gist of the story, but when I'd look in it was still stupid and still not funny.If the writers had realized they only had a decent first half and re-envisioned the whole thing, they could have come up with something enjoyable. But that didn't happen."
77,Bee Movie,,15 September 2008,"Funny here and there but otherwise the plot is flawed and gets weaker as it goes, while some of the ""adult material"" is perhaps misjudged","After several days of education, Barry B. Benson is one of millions of bees being given their job of the rest of their life. Thing is, he doesn't particularly want to be worked till he dies without at least living a little bit first. Slipping in with the crew heading out to collect pollen, Barry discovers the world outside of the hive  never normally seen by worker bees. However he is separated from the pack and finds himself trapped in a flat but he is spared from being squashed by the kindness of Vanessa, a human female. Such is his affection for her that he decides to talk to her and, once she is over the initial shock, they start getting on and hanging out. Barry loves his time in the wider world until he discovers that humans harvest honey in bee ""camps"" and decides that it is time to take a stand.On the face of it Bee Movie looks like a lot of fun  all the quality that we have come to expect from animated features such as Toy Story and Shrek with the acerbic wit of Seinfeld to appeal to the adults in the way that these films always have references and one-liners for us. And for the first third it is pretty much on that course as we are on familiar territory  a world of the characters but twisted to be like our world, we have seen it in Cars, Antz, all of them in fact. It is witty and clever but then the writers decide that bees can talk to humans and vice versa and from here it is all downhill through a court case and the near destruction of life on earth (plants being kinda important in the whole food chain & oxygen-generation things). With all this the story never really works and, as an adult it seemed a massive story-line to use within such a small film and it never engaged me, meanwhile kids will not be affected that much but the plotting does detract from the humour accessible to them.That is a secondary problem all round actually  that it is just not as quick-fire or smart as one has come to expect from the genre. There are still some funny things in there of course as well as the usual references (the War Games one being my favourite) but they are not consistent enough or funny enough to carry the entire film. Quite surprisingly some of the stuff aimed at adults and used within the plot is in quite poor taste. I'm sure I'll be accused of reaching by those who love the film but it is in no way a leap to say this film does use slavery, race and the Holocaust as plot reference points. Additionally there are gags in there about suicide pacts, Jewish comment etc that even for the adult audience are not that funny or in that good taste. For kids you have to wonder why they would include Pooh Bear being shot down for loving his honey (although to be honest that was one of the funniest bits).The voice cast is heavy with stars of course. Seinfeld is the star and is essentially himself but the makers forget that he was best in ""a show about nothing"" not a plot heavy animated feature  so chances for his style of humour are limited from the get-go. Zellweger offers her name but not much else., while Broderick is at least quite a distinctive voice. Goodman is good value as ever, Bates and Levinson are amusing and Warburton is a nice add for Seinfeld fans. King does his usual stuff again and is outshone by a wonderful Liotta sending himself up  not sure about Sting though. If anything the volume of stars is unnecessary as Winfrey, Torn, Miller and Rock have little to do. Actually Chris Rock's character is a bit misjudged so although I like him it is probably better for him to have been moved out since his character is entirely based on the fact that black people call one another ""blood"" (or it is a gang reference, either way my point about the judgement stands).Bee Movie had potential and for the first half we are in familiar and amusing territory. However the remainder of the film goes steadily off the rails plot-wise which doesn't help counter the fact that it isn't funny enough for either demographic and that some of the material is misjudged and a bit in poor taste (and not just because it is also for kids). Has laughs and is short enough to distract and amuse but by no means does it compare to Toy Story or even Shrek as a total film."
78,Bee Movie,4,18 March 2008,Not up to Pixar's standards,"Unfortunately for Jerry Seinfeld, this movie did not live up to the standards we have come to see with pixar movies. To Pixar's credit their movies are always very entertaining no matter what age you are while keeping the jokes there for the kids. Bee movie lacked in the humor department. Maybe it is my age but the bee jokes were just lame and got old after the first five hundred times jerry Seinfeld made them. Jerry Seinfeld didn't need to make this movie because he has plenty of money from his show and thankfully he got this out of his system.NOTE: The scene with (a certain goodfellas actor) was the best part of the movie."
79,Bee Movie,2,18 November 2007,No Fun at All,"The movie made me laugh (only about 4 times), but none of the jokes had anything to do with the story. Everything about the movie was flat and lifeless.I followed it fine. I got the point of the story. I just didn't care, and the presentation was so bland I didn't want to after the first ten minutes.Voice acting was terrible, and even unsynchronized in some places - you could see lips flapping and expression happening, but they subtly didn't go with the dialogue. The 'Ken' character especially was horrible in this regard. I mean, he was supposed to be annoying, but funny-annoying - not 'ugh. yes we get it please get him off the screen' kind of annoying.Chris Rock was pretty much unused in this story, except for his voice. The other cameos (Sting, Ray Liotta, Larry King) again, just were not funny in any regard, and had no link to the story to make it at least seem like there was a point to including them.2/10. If things like Cat in the Hat didn't exist, this would get a 1."
80,Bee Movie,5,17 November 2007,They shoot Winnie the Pooh!  Not for Kids!,"""Well, the BEE MOVIE was pretty good, but that Winnie the Pooh part was stupid and I wish I could make that part go away.....""Jaden, Age FiveI totally agree Jaden! Jerry Jerry Jerry, what were you thinking? Shooting Winnie the Pooh? That's traumatic for a kid -- and it's a kid movie!!!! Good grief!Aside from this, the movie started good ( a bee wanting to take the road less traveled ), and some of the Jewish jokes were funny ( don't marry a WASP! ).... but overall it kind of went south once it turned into a court room thing....the Incredibles it ain't!"
81,Bee Movie,2,16 November 2007,"boring film, with barely any storyline.","You would think that with this star studded cast, Disney animation, and many commercials on TV, that this movie that would be actually be at least half decent, but unfortunately, it was not.Thanks to the boring storyline, this movie was painfully boring. The storyline is so cheesy and unrealistic. I almost fell asleep watching this movie. This is definitely a children's movie.Here's the weird part. You would think that with, Jerry Seinfield and Chris Rock that this movie would be at least somewhat funny. But it was not, i didn't crack a laugh all movie long except for end of a movie where they did a lawyer joke. I feel sorry for Seinfeld, he tried to make bee jokes, but it wasn't funny at all.If your an adult don't watch this movie, its way too boring. I only went cause my niece wanted to see this movie, and yes... she loved it..."
82,Bee Movie,2,13 November 2007,"Don't Waste Your Money, Honey!","I was surprised at how utterly boring this movie is. No memorable characters, voices, or music, and almost totally bereft of humor. It has an idiotic premise that is unappealing to adults and, I would guess, boring and incomprehensible to children. The killer is that the picture has surprisingly second rate animation.It discusses abstruse concepts such as job satisfaction and life fulfillment in a phonily cute bee context, and makes lurid attempts at humor in a bee-human romance and bee-ish (read Jewish) jokes. A large portion of the movie takes place in court - a venue that must be mystifying to small kids. The only scene worth the second star was parking a jetliner on ""bee power"".Seeing this was a waste of time and money."
83,Bee Movie,5,10 November 2007,Did they have to shoot our beloved Winnie the Pooh?,"Cute movie, very Seinfeld, it was nice to hear familiar voices from the show. There was a lot of hack comedy, but I liked its message. I think it gives people a new view of bees, which is a good thing. I think they got confused about who the movie was intended for though. My five year old son was very sad that they shot Winnie the Pooh. And there were a couple of other moments that were obviously not for kids. He cried when we got home because he couldn't understand why they would show some of those things. It irritated me that this could have been an appropriate movie to take him to, but they took it just a tad too far to be funny to adults."
84,Bee Movie,,13 April 2008,Simple Folktales,"Why is it that any film marginally close to being marketed for kids needs to be tightly wound around a moral? Its annoying because what they serve up  with few exceptions  are so narrow and silly they damage anything they touch. This is one of the worst offenders I have experienced. The assumption I suppose is that since this is for kids, and people who want to be kids for a while, it has to be ""easy to read."" So instead of starting with a narrative that has strength and color and weaving lessons and drawing cases, they start with the pill. Then everything is there to prop it up and make it pretend to be a story. Some of this scaffolding consists of jokes of various kinds, the chief engineering of the narrative being what kind of jokes to use.So a snake of a lesson surrounded by a fog of petty jokes. What a disaster.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
85,Bee Movie,5,13 January 2008,"Not quite a 'B' movie, but...","Not being a huge fan of Seinfeld, (I'm British, we scheduled it at midnight on BBC 2, that's how popular it was) and not really familiar with the comedy styling of Mr Jerry, I approached the film with trepidation. Lately, computer animated films have been pretty lacklustre (Barnyard, Ant Bully, Madagascar etc) and since the golden age of Pixar you get the feeling that other studios are churning out average productions to make some easy money. Alas my expectations were realised, while Bee Movie is by no means as painful as a nasty sting, you certainly won't get too much of a buzz out of it. You see what I did there?! Tee-hee...I shan't bore you with too much of the plot: You can watch the trailers here or read the plot summary on IMDb, you lazy git. Basically, A neurotic bee called Benny leaves the hive, discovers that bees are being exploited by the humans for honey and then decides to sue them in court for lost earnings. Along the way, he falls in love with a lady called Vanessa who happens to be a florist, and learns valuable lessons about the way nature works. Yawn.Anyway, lets get down to it... the jokes simply aren't funny enough. Most of the humour seems to revolve around Benny's witty little observations on the differences between the human world and his. None of this though, is as hysterical as Z's similar comments in Antz (a much better film), and he just comes across as a bit of a smug twit most of the time. Another problem is the gaping holes in the plot. The cardinal rule of bee society is apparently: Bees can't talk to people. This has been going on for more than 27 million years. As soon as Benny breaks it by thanking Vanessa for saving his life, what consequences are there? Well, he gets into a bit of an argument with his parents but... THAT'S IT. Some big 'rule' if nobody even cares after the event. Also, how does Benny know about man made stuff like straws and box kites before he goes out into the real world, but he hasn't heard of windows and cars? Yes, I know this is just a movie, and as such you shouldn't ask these questions. But COME ON, it doesn't even work from it's own limited sense of logic.My favourite parts were the amusing celebrity cameos, seeing Sting in courtroom asking how he got his name is great fun, as is Ray Liotta's close up of his Emmy award (For a guest spot in ER, I'll have you know). Plus, look out for an appearance from a very special bear, who gets a tranquiliser dart in the butt in one of the funniest scenes. The animation is great, you can pick up each individual hair on the bee's body and the flying sequences are spectacular. What a shame then, that the characterisation is so underwritten there is barely anyone to root for, with hardly a two dimensional person (or insect) in the entire film. The climax, which was obviously meant to have the audience cheering to the rafters, just felt tacked on with little or no excitement evident at all. I can't tell you if there was any funny ending credits, as I just got up and left afterwards because I was so unmoved.Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad flick by any means. It's just the term by-the-numbers was invented for movies like this, and studios had better start pulling their finger out and putting more effort into their CGI films before Joe Public realises they're just going through the motions without putting their heart into their work. Oh I forgot, we got Shrek 4 coming out soon. YAY, bless Dreamworks for their originality. Now, in honour of the title I have devised a special new never-been-seen-before rating system. Here goes: B Movie gets a C. Phew, that was worth the wait wasn't it fellas?! Note: That's 5/10 on the alternate scale, dude."
86,Bee Movie,8,16 December 2007,i thought it was a great funny film! (remember it is a kids film),"I think people are forgetting that this is a child's movie and are being way too critical, the writer was nice enough to include quite a few funny jokes that would make an adult laugh, so quit your belly-aching and enjoy this funny animation.Even though its not in the league as toy story or finding nemo its really up close in the top. But it has the traditional storyline of breaking from for what your supposed to 'bee' (:D) and becoming something of an individual, which i think is good for children to know.I found myself laughing out loud from this kids film even if I'm 17. The story gets going quite quickly but its done gently enough to feel attached to the characters.I think the voices were a great choice and the comedic timing was really good. I'm rubbish at remembering names but the key bee's voice was brilliant and really hilarious and some of the things he said were memorable.I would definitely recommend watching this animation as there are too many out today which is a bit annoying, this one should be remembered."
87,Bee Movie,8,5 December 2007,Entertaining and enjoyable,"Bee movie is a good movie although nothing spectacular. It has a very complex humor not everyone would understand, the kind of comedy Jerry Seinfeld does, very sarcastic. The story about a recent graduated bee called Barry B. Benson, who wants more of life than just working in the hive for the rest of his life is quite original and interesting. It is brilliantly written by Seinfeld. The animation isn't something out of this world but still very well made. The music selection is quite interesting. The cast of voices is excellent. Jerry Seinfeld is great as Barry its like watching him in the shape of a bee, Chris Rock is wonderful as the mosquito, so hilarious, Renee Zellweger's performance as Vanessa wasn't great but it was good enough, Patrick Warburton as Vanessa's misunderstood boyfriend is great, Matthew Broderick as Barry's friend was good and a brief but funny appearance from John Goodman as the mean lawyer. Definitely this is a movie worthy to watch, enjoyable and entertaining, recommendable for all the family."
88,Bee Movie,7,21 November 2007,"3 things you can't avoid, death, taxes and Bee Movie","If only our poor politicians could muster the money to create the incredible advertising monster that was Bee Movie. If you have kids it is pretty much a guarantee that you'll be asked to go see this movie or buy it when the DVD is released. Do not fear, this film actually lives up to the hype. For the infants, bright shiny colors and movement, for the kids, good animation, a fun story and some fun set pieces. For the adults pretty much all of the above and a plot that will keep you entertained if not enthralled and some laughs. The storyline goes through responsibility, duty, family, consequences for actions and Ray Liotta. The cast is a great ensemble, including, the aforementioned Liotta who parodies both himself and his career, Rene Zegweller, Matthew Broderick and of course Jerry Seinfeld who also co-wrote this. It also has Rip Torn who I cannot watch now without hearing ""if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball."" Forget logic, this is a kids movie and it's not about you, just be thankful Jerry Seinfeld put some stuff in this to keep you happy too, not all kids movies are so considerate. If only all kids movies were this good."
89,Bee Movie,6,7 November 2007,A Nutshell Review: Bee Movie,"Let's see, we have A Bug's Life, then Antz, then the insect animated films gave way to a host of animal talkies, including dancing penguins, cows with confused genetic makeup, and zoo animals thinking they're better off in the wild, chef rats, amongst an array of hits and misses, recycling the same old tactics and game plan to snare the movie going audience.Wise-cracking animals, check. Pop culture references, check. CG animation that resembles the real world, check. Celebrity voices, let's see, we have Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Larry King, Ray Liotta, Sting, Barry Levinson, Kathy Bates, and even Oprah Winfrey. But we all know by now that you can throw in the craziest antics, stuff the movie with recognizable voices, but Pixar has taught the lesson that it always boils down to the strength of the story. And this is what Bee Movie is severely lacking.Not that it didn't try, but it went tangential to what it probably had intended, and it spawned into a big bag unmanageable hydra. Jerry Seinfeld is Barry Benson, a bee who refuses to conform to the laws of nature to having become stuck in a one-role job for the rest of his life. Before committing himself to menial tasks in the honey making process, he decides to venture out with the cool pollen collectors and see the outside world. And in the process, comes into direct contact with Vanessa Bloome the florist (voiced by Zellweger). Oh, did I also mention that bees speak English? It's just that they adhere to Commandment Number One that they shut their traps so that we won't know they understand us. Yeah right.So if you'd believe that, you'd believe anything that the movie throws at you. It becomes a courtroom drama with the usual lawyer jokes thrown in. It becomes an anti-worker exploitation movie, to stand up for the little ones, with reminders that small things matter in the whole scheme of things. It becomes a documentary on the laws of nature and the environmental / ecological equilibrium that has to be maintained. And the ultimate out of place scene involves a bloody jumbo jet in the sky in homage to the Airplane spoofs. Yes, while I know Bee Movie pays its homage to B-movies, you'd probably still wonder what the scriptwriters had in the coffee.But given its multiple personality and indecision to focus on something that it can chew, the graphics here are still no less than stunning. The bees in flight, with the mashing of the black and yellow, is pure poetry in motion, blending well with various backgrounds, be it the city skyline, or the green lungs with colourful flowers dotting the landscape. It's extremely fluid with attention paid to the details, and would be worth every penny should there be an IMAX version of this portion of the movie. Such scenes warrant the price of an admission ticket, but alas, more could have probably been done to save the movie.Bee Movie is again targeted at kids, although chances are they'll miss the many adult jokes and references so come fast and furious (some of which just fall flat unfortunately). And having a lack of ""cute"" characters, might dent its appeal, and narrow merchandising opportunities. Better luck next time Jerry!"
90,Bee Movie,7,24 December 2016,Do you like jazz?,"Wow, what is there to say? I'm completely blown away by what is essentially a masterpiece. A movie that was heavily watched over by the vultures that are the critics. Waiting to have something bad to say; something that would hinder this film's integrity. Despite of that, despite of the pressures ensued while making this delicacy, the directors Steve Hickner & Simon Smith, they nailed it. A film that tugs at your heart strings and brings a tear to the manliest man's eye. An artistic piece that reminds you of who you are and what you stand for. What it is, is essentially a nostalgia act, reminding us all of when we were at our very most happy state of mind.I can't lie, I was a little upset at the lack of Oscar nominations and awards generally. John Goodman's voice acting is sensational and all out gripping. I was almost routing for the guy! (He's the bad guy). Surely he should have had at very least an Oscar nomination? Not to mention that Barry B. Benson was coming out with the most inspirational quotes since Martin Luther King. Where's the awards for that?! You know to sum it all up, there's been a lot of good animated films in this generation. There's 'Finding Nemo', 'Chicken Little', 'Monster House' etc.. But this, this is a level above; it's raised the bar. I can honestly end this review saying, this is animated equivalent of The Shawshank Redemption.Thanks for your time, and keep on pollinating."
91,Bee Movie,10,1 December 2016,Comedy Masterpiece,"Bee Movie is utterly amazing. It's like a sequel to a movie no one has ever seen, but maybe someday we can get the prequel it deserves in ""A-Movie."" Why is it so great though?Jerry Seinfeld, first of all. When you have a comedic genius like that working on your film, how can it not be a true work of art? On top of that, he lends his iconic voice to the main character, Barry B. Benson.Secondly, the puns. You could argue this is a result of Seinfeld, but I say it's because of the subject matter. Either way, the puns just keep rolling throughout the film. My personal favorite has to be the quip Barry makes about getting a perfect report card; straight B's.Finally, the plot. I was not expecting such a deep plot from a movie about bees, but it actually turns into a case of civil rights as the bees discover that humans use them for their products, and the humans discover that the bees are actually sentient. Leave it to Seinfeld to take what should be the mundane and warp it into something far more interesting and introspective. I would recommend this movie to most anyone, except the staunchest of pun-haters."
92,Bee Movie,2,5 February 2011,Simply Awful!,"I wonder how many people were paid to write good reviews of this trash. Seinfeld is obnoxious, loud, and can't hold a script with another actor to save his life ... no wonder he never made it in movies and only had the one sitcom. The premise of this movie is beyond asinine! Only those under 4 might find there anything to enjoy. Bees in a high tech society one minute, talking, going from grade school to college in 9 days, yadda yadda yadda... Just stupid.Only redeeming facet of this movie was the voice of Reene Zelweger, and that only because I in particular like her. I rated this a two as I've seen worse, but not much. Moreover, I rated it a two to offset those morons that gave it a 10! PLEASE, just shoot me now.Save your money, save your time, and most of all save your mind and avoid this tripe."
93,Bee Movie,3,29 November 2009,"""B"" movie is putting it optimistically","I recently saw this movie while sitting with my little brother (who finds pretty much everything funny one way or another) on the couch. Although I may be a little older than the target audience I consider myself to be a huge fan of animated movies (particularly Pixar, but any kind will do) and have seen just about as many of them as any movie fanatic ever has. So, I know what I'm talking about when I say that this film is just plain awful. The trademark of movies like this is lots of visual fun to make the kids giggle, and some funny cross references to real life or other movies for the adults. Although I'm pretty sure this movie did have these elements, I was probably checking the back of the DVD case for the run time and missed it. Remember my brother who laughs at everything? For a greater portion of the movie, his face bore the half asleep, half disinterested, all bored look of someone watching a Nat-Geo episode on some animal you don't recognize that's been extinct for ten thousand years, in a country whose name you can't pronounce.It was literally that bad. For a movie written by a comic, I expected something more than a prolonged, generic, boring story about some lovable animal whose fellow critters are being harassed by the big, bad humans. For the first hour or so of the movie I figured it would get better or something, then finally we reached the climax of film. A courtroom scene? Really? Is that what they're doing now? Throwing courtroom scenes in children's movies? I couldn't believe it. From there the movie devolved into the customary happy ending, where the little bees win their freedom from the evil, tyrannical, corporate owners of big business. All in all, if you shut the sound off and maybe play the soundtrack to Rambo in the background while watching ""Bee Movie"", it might possibly be interesting. Otherwise, it's just another boring flick that not so subtly tries to work in some environmentalist propaganda along the way."
94,Bee Movie,3,19 February 2009,A complete travesty,"I'm a big fan of Jerry Seinfeld and I love how he can make a joke out of anything. I gave a point for him trying to expand himself.However, this movie was a very small handful of chuckle moments wrapped in a disaster of a film. I guess my initial reaction to a lot of what I had seen was a complete inability to accept the reality of it.Now, I'm not one at all for wanting reality in the movies I see. In fact, I go for the unreal normally. I don't go to the movies to see what I see every day. Perhaps I was steered the wrong way by the plot, but I found myself watching a movie that was trying to teach me that bees were the only reason that plant life can survive. Group that up with insects trying to romance humans, as well as an overlaying storyline that will set back Jewish people another 65 years on the stereotype curve, and I just can't possibly be excited about anything this movie has to offer.Dragging your kids to see this movie is an attempt at a cheap way to keep them quiet for 90 minutes."
95,Bee Movie,5,1 October 2008,"Buzzes around chaotically, but OK for a single viewing","AntZ, Bugs etc. have all done it before, and better than this: the whole deal about members of an insect colony dystopia being relegated to hum-drum pre-assigned roles for their entire lives (metaphors for humans trapped in self-imposed drudgery), and one is a rebel who breaks out of the mold to somehow save the day and change things.That premise is getting stale, and isn't really interesting any more. Along the way, there's usually some topical cultural jokes, and with Jerry Seinfeld as the lead character's voice, you can count on this formulaic approach here. Seinfeld isn't very funny in this outing, however, and what funny lines the movie does have are lost to kids as the film focuses too much on adult humor.A bee and a human make friends (you never really know why), setting up a series of adventures for both. Humans are mostly stereotypes, and many of the bee characters are too, for that matter. There are a few gags that are actually pretty good: the lawyer bit comes to mind (although even this sequence is ripped off from other movies).The plot, although weakly contrived, is easy to follow, and the outcome is cleverly done. Entertaining enough when you haven't got anything better to do."
96,Bee Movie,3,23 August 2008,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of the old SEINFELD show, and it was hard for me to imagine Jerry trying something TV- or movie-wise that didn't work. But that's what happened here.You might think that he's more accustomed to doing adult humor, but a lot of his comedy routines show great (and humorous) insight into the world of kids. Some of those routines were even boiled down to a really good kids' book (HALLOWEEN).But he's just out of his element here. The result feels like someone has unsuccessfully attempted to copy the work of better animated-movie makers. The bee jokes feel forced, as in a really bad attempt at channeling A BUG'S LIFE. The overall plot is pretty good, but in many ways it's just not carried out well. It especially bothered me the way some things were just kind of left hanging, in that subtle way that bad writers often do. This is probably the only movie I've ever seen where a character was treated like a total villain (the fat lawyer) yet turned out to be the one who was right (not that this point was in any way dealt with, or even made clear, like a good writer would have done).I expected better from Jerry. Guess this just wasn't his thing. Skip this and watch something from Pixar and/or Disney instead."
97,Bee Movie,4,10 August 2008,Where's the science teacher?,"Why is it that a film, no matter how fun or cute, can't be bothered to take science seriously? I'm referring to the main character in ""Bee Movie,"" Barry. If the producers had taken the time to do a bit of homework, they would have realized that bee hive workers are ALL female; the only purpose of the males is to reproduce with the queen. Having Barry wanting to be a ""pollen jock"" is nothing more than pure fantasy, and, for me, it destroyed any credibility the film might otherwise have.That said, the animation was certainly up to standards, and there were a number of amusing events sprinkled throughout the movie. However, when a producer can't be bothered to get the details right, it's hard to go away feeling anything less than cheated."
98,Bee Movie,5,8 July 2008,Definitely not one of the stronger animated features to come out in recent years,"It's common for famous stars to voice main characters in these computer animated films, and in this case, it's Jerry Seinfeld, well-known for his stand-up comedy, and especially for his starring role as himself in the long-running, smash hit sitcom of the '90s, ""Seinfeld"". Here, in 2007's ""Bee Movie"", he provided the voice for the main character, an anthropomorphic bee, and was also heavily involved in the writing. With a comedian like him having a big part of the movie, it may have had a lot of potential, but unfortunately, it certainly didn't turn out the highest point in Seinfeld's career.Barry B. Benson is a bee who manages to graduate from college with his best friend, Adam Flayman, and both of them intend to start working at Honex Industries, the honey making industry in their hive. However, Barry learns that whatever job he chooses, he will be stuck with it for the rest of his life! While Adam has no problem working in the honey factory until he dies, Barry has different ambitions, and leaves the hive with the pollen jocks one day. At first, it feels great to finally see the outside world, but after some encounters with humans where his life is in danger, he is convinced they are crazy! Fortunately, after one human named Vanessa Bloome surprises the young bee when she rescues him from being killed, he is grateful, as it appears not all humans are dangerous, so he comes back to thank her, even though talking to humans is against the bee law! Barry soon begins to bond with Vanessa, and one day, while at the grocery store with her, he discovers honey on the shelves! He learns that humans steal honey from bees, and is very upset, so he decides to sue the human race! I'm no die-hard Jerry Seinfeld fan, but am relatively familiar with his work, and some memorable moments of ""Seinfeld"". With ""Bee Movie"", I didn't have super high expectations, knowing it wasn't one of the most popular animated features from recent years, but was hoping for some good laughs, which I didn't get much of. I laughed a bit here and there, including the part where Barry talks to Vanessa for the first time, and she think she's dreaming, but overall, the humour was disappointing, and I found that it was sometimes too simple, and likely more for kids. Also, for the most part, I found the story pretty boring, though maybe intriguing at times, including around the end, with a moral. Lastly, of all the computer animated efforts I've seen, this one doesn't exactly have the most memorable bunch of characters.If you ask me, this DreamWorks Animation production is probably not one that can appeal to kids and adults alike. I would say this one is more for kids (including the humour, like I mentioned before), just keep in mind the PG rating, since there are some mild sexual references. Personally, at my age (nearly 22), the only benefits I got from ""Bee Movie"" were just an occasional laugh, I guess some rare MILDLY exciting or touching moments (notice the emphasis on mildly), and Vanessa Bloome. Yes, some people seem to think that no sane person could ever be attracted to a cartoon character, but I say nonsense! I find Helen Parr/Elastigirl from Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" (a movie which blew me away) attractive, and Vanessa Bloome reminded me a lot of her. Anyway, the few highlights I found in the movie were not enough, and overall, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down and say it's one of the weaker efforts from DreamWorks Animation."
99,Bee Movie,5,5 June 2008,Decent but not really for small children,"This movie is decent and has some funny parts, but I think there were some areas that were lacking. The animation, for one, just doesn't compare with other animation films, such as Cars, Ratatouille, etc. I was especially disappointed with Ken's character. His facial expressions did not convey what he was supposedly feeling in the movie. My 7 year old son liked it because it was animated but he missed most of the jokes. I had to explain to him that they really didn't kill Winnie the Pooh. Jokes about ""making out"" and ""drag queens"" were not really suitable either. I thought all the celebrity jokes were a bit overdone. Celebrity references in animated films are just not funny anymore. I really wish Dreamworks would not create a film with adult jokes and then target small children. If you have older children, this may be a decent rental (not purchase). I gave this a 5/10."
100,Bee Movie,10,26 July 2017,My collar stay popping',"Spoiler: You like Jazz? The movie itself was dank as flick and i would tell my meme dealer to watch it 6 times. I need 5 lines so here i goas a man man of breeding and delicacy, could not but feel some jazz send nudes Y O U L I K E J A Z Z too much to have been upset by him in Fathers cell, and so to have forgotten himself. ""T monks were not to blame, get in your cell"
101,Bee Movie,2,8 January 2017,Bee For Bad.,"In Short-PASSAs you saw in my summary, it wasn't a good film. Had a few decent parts I enjoyed. I gave it a 2/10 because I did think a part or two was funny due to Jerry Seinfeld's jokes. And it did have a really important message I will go into. For now, the bad!! It started off okay. How bees work and what they do. But then just got beezarre(Ha! Get it?) And by bizarre I mean the fact that Jerry Seinfeld's character, the bee, Barry B. Benson seems to have some weird relationship with Renee Zellweger's character Vanessa Bloome. Why you ask? Because she is a human and him a bee. Not sure why they included that element in there. For parents to watch it's painful. And to explain to the kids that bees aren't really a friendly insect to play with had me question the movie for what they were trying to teach kids.To go on from there, a bee and a florist sue the honey business for bees to get their honey back. And that whole part was dreadful. John Goodman's lawyer character was really frustrating to watch. Again I wasn't sure how this got approved to become a movie. The jokes and storyline so far at this point had me asking myself why am I still watching this. And the only reason I ended up watching this film was because of the jokes on the internet I've seen ridiculing the film. I can see why. Towards the end of the movie the only reason why I gave it a 2 was because of the message towards people about how important bees actually are to the world. And that is true. We need bees, they give us food and plants! So it was grand that they included that message. But the message itself wasn't a reason to get kids or parents to watch this film. I rather say choose a documentary about bees instead. Then comes the actually ending where the bee becomes a lawyer. Which threw me off so much. Because here I was thinking Barry was going to get a job working with the bees. Nope he becomes a lawyer. I was surprised how much of a cringeworthy movie this was. Animation was okay but with how the story and plot were heading I was just dumbfounded how this became a movie. ""A Bug's Life"" (1998) and ""Antz"" (1998) turned out decent. This movie however did not. The message was brilliant. But the way they played it off was bad. Either should have changed it up with how they interacted with humans and didn't make it so ridiculous. I think that is the problem with the film. The only good I can say about the film is it had jokes or puns that made me chuckle a bit. (Don't get me wrong, they had bad jokes and puns too!) And the message about bees. Chris Rock had a few parts that made me laugh. I can understand the movie being one of which kids will just want to watch it because it's animation. So even if you're an adult or teen I wouldn't recommend this movie nonetheless. Unless you want to watch a bad movie. But in truth this movie isn't worth the time. Pick a better children's movie or rather pick a bee documentary if you want to watch about bees.In conclusion the film is a PASS for me. Like I mention in my review, that is basically the movie. You can read it and move on and won't miss a thing. Save your time and pick a better educating film for the kids."
102,Bee Movie,3,20 May 2013,Curious to a point.,"This movie was OK but I honestly had some issues with it. For one bees in reality have no emotions whatsoever and are run by natural genetic programming. When they detect a threat they attack but in turn do not feel pain. Falling in love is totally out of the question. The big part of the movie I have a problem with is making the bee keeper seem evil. In truth smoking the bees does nothing to harm them the reason this is done is to pacify them by making them feel a threat of a forest fire they then will engorge themselves on honey aka food for a flight to safety to wait out the fire. When a bee gets engorged it will get lazy or fly off. Beekeepers are one of the only things keeping bees alive and propagating these days. There have been a 65% in bee loss in the last 10 years due to a mysterious circumstance bee keepers call CCD or Colony Collapse Disorder. They are not sure what causes it but if it wasn't for the bee keeper caring for the bees and providing shelter and observation the remainder is highly prone to fungus pesticides mites and predators. They are thinning and the bee keeper is the last line of defense. So giving them emotions and stating the bee keeper is evil and ""mistreating"" non feeling bees for profit is foolish and falsely educating children who watch the movie to real facts. Bees are important the keepers are vital we can't see protesters against them in 20 years started from an uneducated movie. So it gets a 3 for entertainment but either than that I don't agree to it's message"
103,Bee Movie,4,7 April 2010,"honestly, I did NOT like this film much at all","This film was supposed to be for all ages, however, this film put me and everyone I know to sleep. Its dull, over-the-top silly and just plain boring after a while.The CGI is nice, but the plot had me scratching my head and going ""What the hell?"" most of the time. The implied romantic story between a Bee and a Human made me feel uncomfortable, if I wanted Beastiality, I'd play Sonic 06.That being said, the characters very much annoyed me. Whenever the main character speaks, I feel annoyed, hes just uninteresting, which is to say, ALL of the characters if you ask me are uninteresting. Only one part of this movie made me laugh and thats the ""Hi Bee, Hi! AAAAAA"" part.That being said, its not the worst film I have ever seen, but I still don't like it at all."
104,Bee Movie,4,23 February 2009,"Pretty Lame. Cute, but Lame","Seinfeld, let's face it, was the ONLY redeeming factor, herein and I found even his ""performance"" lacking. This work features a story with no heart whatsoever, gives it flaccid execution, and doesn't do a thing to further its own end, leaving the audience feeling a loss when it's all said and done. It poses a dilemma and then does little in the way of offering creative or innovative solutions and instead resorts to the worst kind of popular tripe to esoterically drivel itself into a lackluster and ineffectual ending. The dilemma itself is a ""could-be"" but the solution provided is a ""no way"" solution, leaving us scratching our heads as to what in THE world we just watched. I like Seinfeld, and so had hopes for this work, but I think Seinfeld's Larry King interview wasn't the only indication that Seinfeld's glory days are over, and he's just left with fonder memories. Adios, Jerry.It rates a 3.6/10 from...the Fiend :."
105,Bee Movie,9,19 November 2007,Fun for the Whole Family!,"I'm starting to get to that age when you start disliking many animated kid's movies. So when I first saw Bee Movie advertised, I thought, ""That movie looks so bad- I never want to see it."" However, I started talking to people I know who had seen it, and they said it was really good. When my parents (finally )took me and my two sisters to see Bee Movie, I was totally excited. In fact, I even wore black and yellow for the occasion! During the movie, I totally cracked up at the jokes, luckily none of them really disgusting. Also, the animation was awesome. The inside of the hive looked very realistic. The film was packed with excitement to. Overall, the entire 90 minutes of the movie (trust me- it will seem like a lot less when you go see it), I was either on the edge of my seat, laughing my head off, gawking at the great animation, or simply sitting back and enjoying the show. Animation- 8/10 Action- 9/10 Humor- 10/10 Overall- 9/10."
106,Bee Movie,7,4 November 2007,"NOT so great, but beautiful visuals in the beginning of movie","this is NOT a great film, not even close. but the visuals in the first thirty minutes alone are worth the price of admission, just stunning and beautiful. and the sheryl crow song at the end in cute and uplifting, but beyond that, not much here. TOO MUCH SEINFELD< hes in EVERY SCENE< and he is NOT funny.... pretty poor story, very bad court scenes, and just so so everywhere else. I would have only given this film s FIVE out of ten, but bumped it up to seven just cause of the stunning visuals of the hive in the first half hour. thats about as good as this one gets ! You would expect jerry Seinfeld to bee funny, i am nuts about the series SEINFELD< its the funniest thing ever on TV, and he had FOUR YEARS to make this one funny, its JUST NOT FUNNY....!! pretty disappointing... renee zelwegger does a great job, her voice is fantastic, she puts her all into this one... if you have little kids, they will probably be mesmerized by the look of the first thirty minutes of the show, beyond that, they will be fast ASLEEP by the end of the movie, bored out of their skulls."
107,Bee Movie,10,22 January 2008,Best 3d Movie to Hit Theaters,"I've seen many 3d movies by Pixar and Dreamworks, but I think that this movie tops anything I have ever seen by them. They bring the humor of children and adults together to create this hilarious story.Not everybody eats honey, but a lot of humans eat honey. You may not even know it. Well, Barry has just found out that, and he and his new human friend decides to sue Humans. This causes a lot of trouble with flowers and many flowers die. This is now Barry's fault and now he is going to fix it all once and for all.This movie is clever. It's hard to believe that no one has come up with a movie idea as crazy as this. I do recommend this movie for all of you Pixar and DreamWorks fans. This movie is not only for children, so don't be fooled."
108,Bee Movie,8,25 November 2007,Awesome movie!,"Like most other movies involving small creatures, this movie makes you laugh as well as inspires you to make a difference! I loved every little piece of it!!The story holds your attention throughout, the plot is really well thought of, and the dialog - really funny.Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld) is the hero of the movie. I really liked the animation and the humor all throughout the movie.If you are looking to have a good one and half hour, the bee movie is for you!The final song in the movie fittingly ends it."
109,Bee Movie,7,16 November 2007,"Good, but I'm disappointed","After all the hype we've been getting for Bee Movie, I was so looking forward to seeing this film. It looked like it was a guaranteed hit; I decided to check this movie out this afternoon and even though I still liked Bee Movie. It seemed just like this was more meant for the adults than the kids, some of the references I'm certain children wouldn't get or even shouldn't get. I'm glad that they are making these movies for also the adults to enjoy, but I think these film makers are forgetting the audience this movie is supposed to be aimed at. Like I did laugh at the Ray Liotta and Sting references, but what kids would get that? The story was good despite some minor flaws, which I'll explain later, but it was clever.Barry is a bee who is living in the typical bee world where you live, you work, and you die. He's getting sick of it too, he wants something different, so he goes out into the human world. He meets a nice lady named Venessa and decides to break the Bee law and talk to her, they develop a friendship. He discovers in the human world that they sell honey and he's working his butt off for it, so he decides to go ahead and sue the human race for all the honey they sell. But he realizes soon that bee's mean more than just making honey.Bee Movie is cute and has a few good laughs I will always admit, but I'm just disappointed with the humor as well as the script, it seemed just too bland at moments and very predictable. But I had a problem with how the humans handled finding out that bee's can talk, they just accepted it very easily. Like I said I think the humor also was just too aimed at adults than the kids, so I'm not sure if this could qualify for family film of the year. Bee Movie is definitely worth a watch, but don't expect too much.7/10"
110,Bee Movie,9,3 November 2007,Great for kids and adults,"This is a very good animated movie. The kind Pixar used to make until they made Cars. Dreamworks has proved they can do more than just Shrek. The movie never got really preachy, probably because Jerry Seinfeld was involved. There was enough for kids and adults to enjoy. I liked all of the bee type humor like the style of hairdos all the female bees wore. And the way this movie treats lawyers is awesome.spoiler alert: I just love the 'message' of this movie. It teaches kids that lawyers, stupid judges and an all encompassing police state are bad for the environment. The Chris Rock line at the end about lawyers is awesome."
111,Bee Movie,8,22 December 2016,It's a great meme...and a pretty good movie too!,"After Bee Movie became my favorite meme, I decided I ought to see for myself how the movie fared. It seems this movie has been stereotyped as a ""bad movie"", or at least mediocre, but I have to admit, even just from reading the entire script, watching the movie sped up to fit in the span of a few minutes, hearing a reading of the entire script, and watching countless variations of the trailer in which the word ""bee"" triggers instances of video editing brilliance that would make YouTube Poop proud, I actually saw quite a few glimmers of potential that made me genuinely interested in the film for its own sake. Its semi-bad reputation caused me to worry that it might turn out to be a waste of ninety minutes after all, but these fears turned out to be completely unjustified. And as long as you don't set your expectations super-high or anything, I have high hopes that your experience will be similar.In many ways, the storyline is absurd and silly and doesn't try to be logical or actually make sense, but this is nowhere near as big a problem as you might assume. To be honest, I actually like the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously or try to analyze the implications of the world it's set up. It just is what it is, and it's just trying to be fun and humorous. Not every animated cartoon needs a super well-designed story as long as it's funny and creative, and this movie is both.This movie's approach to depicting bee life was equal parts whimsical and absurd, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Everything about their clever take on anthropomorphism of bees and bee society is easy to love. The aesthetics of the bee world are really fantastic, and I dug the character designs a lot too. As someone who's passionate about anthropomorphic cartoon animals in general, there's few things that please me more than a clever and effective blending of human traits and animal ones, and this movie had that in spades. Imbuing a beehive and bees and a society that's very much inspired by bee society (even if it's not exactly accurate) with so many familiar human traits serves as a really great backdrop for a comedic film.The comedy of this movie is really pretty solid too, with a fair number of great laughs and a subtle sense of humor throughout that made it very pleasing and fun overall. A lot of the humor appeals to adults and would completely fly past the heads of kiddos, at times even creating a strangely incredibly enjoyable sense of awkwardness due to the jokes being so unfitting for a kid's film (apparently, a major cause of the ironic fandom over on Tumblr). As an over-the-age-of-18 individual myself, this was mostly a good thing for me, but I did wonder whether or not kids would find the film as amusing. I guess maybe the occasional bee puns are for the kiddos. Of course, the over-the-top-ness and absurdity of the situations was also a really major source of humor, and I think that would appeal to everyone.The characters were a lot more lovable than I expected. Barry just seemed like such a likable and genuine guy, and I really appreciated the fact that they neither tried to make him uber-talented or cool, nor a lame loser. I particularly loved how they handled his failure to quite line up with bee society: they didn't try too hard to make him look like a total hero for being a non-conformist or make the bee society around him look extra evil. They used a much more even-handed light, showing how he could both be someone interested in the outside world and not content to fit in the confining guidelines of society, but also how others might consider him crazy for doing so. Vanessa similarly came across as a very genuine character, which is pretty remarkable considering her feelings about bees! And her boyfriend, Ken, was a great source of humor.Something special about this movie is that, as absurd as it was, it also wasn't too loud, frenetic, or fast-paced. It was relatively subdued for the most part, not relying on constant slapstick or musical numbers or other things that try too hard to keep kids' attention. Personally, I really like this tone, especially since the more down-to-earth feel creates a nice and very extreme contrast to the ridiculousness of what's actually going on.Overall, if you're looking for an animated movie that can be genuinely funny even for adults and don't mind (or even enjoy!) absurdity, I recommend you give Bee Movie a chance. If you're like me, you'll find yourself surprisingly satisfied."
112,Bee Movie,8,3 July 2008,A movie Buzz,To Bee or not to Bee ..........that is the Movie.A sweet little animation movie for all honey bunch types. It is about Barry B. Benson ( Jerry Seinfeld) who goes through a typical Bee upbringing and Bar Mitzvah type ceremony of becoming and adult Bee which is three days of Bee University and the goes into the human world where he must suck nectar and propagate pollen.Barry has an unusual encounter with a Human who saves him Vanessa Bloome ( Renee Zellwegar) who saves his life. He then subsequently discovers how Humans exploit Bees for their Honey and actually manages to serve a class action against the Human race on behalf of Bees.Beautiful bee film with a bit of humour attached in the Seinfeld style.Being a bee fan I believe it was worth the buzz.
113,Bee Movie,9,1 July 2008,I'm Impressed!,"Bee Movie was an excellent movie! It was about a bee named Barry .B. Benson, a bee that had just graduated from college. When he finds out that he can only have one job for his entire life, he decides to go outside the hive so that he can see what the real world is like before he is set to work for the rest of his life. When he gets lost from the bees he had been traveling with, he shelters himself on the balcony of someone in New York city's apartment. He accidentally goes inside the apartment and all of the people inside it try to kill him except for one. He is saved by Vanessa Bloom, a florist in New York. Barry and Vanessa become friends. One day Barry finds out that humans have been selling bee's hard worked for honey, and he decides to sue humans. He has many hilarious adventures along the way to winning his trial in court. Barry .B. Benson is voiced by famous comedian Jerry Seinfeld. Seinfeld also produces and writes the hilarious movie. Bee Movie is filled with many pop culture jokes, such as a ""Bee Larry king"" and a ""Hive at Five"" news station.I'm sure that children as well as adults will enjoy this movie. My rating: 9/10"
114,Bee Movie,10,27 May 2008,Bee Movie: One of PDI's best,"Produced by Pacific Data Images, ""Bee Movie"" is one of the most funniest movies ever released in 2007. At the start of the movie, right after the Dreamworks Animation logo, the PDI logo from ""Antz"" shows up (you know, it's the PDI logo we all know with a picture of a figure with his hands in the air whilst holding a movie camera), followed by the main titles for this movie.We are introduced to the main hero of this movie's story, a bee named Barry B. Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld), who had experiences with his mom (voiced by Kathy Bates) and dad (voiced by Barry Levinson), and he recently graduated from college with his best friend, Adam Flayman (voiced by Matthew Broderick of Disney's ""The Lion King""), a bee with a toy sword sticking out of his butt.One day, while making honey with the Pollen Jocks, Barry ran into a nice young woman named Vanessa Bloome (voiced by Renee Zellweger of PDI's ""Shark Tale""), who is that much of a florist. Barry and Vanessa became good friends. Barry soon found out that humans stole the honey from the bees ever since many years ago.Along the way, Barry had several run-ins with various characters, such as Vanessa's partner at tennis, Ken (voiced by Patrick Warburton of Disney's ""The Emperor's New Groove""), Mooseblood the Mosquito (voiced by Chris Rock of PDI's ""Madagascar""), and a main defense lawyer named Layton T. Montgomery (voiced by John Goodman of Pixar's ""Monsters, Inc."") when Barry and Vanessa are in a local Court House.Afterwards, New York City became desolated. To undo this chaos, Barry and Vanessa must go to Pasadena, California to find a last batch of flowers somewhere in a local parade. Finally, Barry and all of the Pollen Jocks pollinate New York City back to the way it was before whilst the song ""Here Comes The Sun"" (performed by The Beatles) plays in the background. At one point, a kid shouts, ""Mom! The bees are back!"" Towards the end of the movie, Vanessa's floral shop, ""Vanessa's Flowers"", has changed the sign's name to ""Vanessa and Barry: Flowers; Honey; Legal Advice"".Vanessa sells and pays her customers not only bouquets of flowers (and some flowers in flowerpots), but also several jars of honey, as Barry runs a law firm inside the same building, and behind Barry's office door marked ""Insects at Law"", Mooseblood works alongside with Barry in his office when Barry interviews a giraffe (voiced by Wayne Knight of Disney's ""Tarzan""). I laughed at the funny lines involving some Toys-R-Us in-jokes and some ""Sesame Street"" in-jokes that the giraffe is saying to Barry like, ""Action figures, dolls, video games. It's all me. And they put my picture on every toy store!"" (Barry says ""Uh-huh. Uh-huh."") ""Everybody thinks my kind are plant eaters, but I'd rather live on ants!"" (Barry says ""I have no idea."")There was clearly a hint that being a client that Barry is interviewing him, even when he brought along toys with him, the giraffe was clearly a relative of Melman the Giraffe from PDI's ""Madagascar"". Now, where was I? Oh, yes! During the end credits, there is a catchy song called ""Thinkin' Bee"" performed by Jerry Seinfeld and Matthew Broderick. And after the end credits, the Paramount Pictures logo flashes on and off, followed by the PDI logo that flashes on and off with the help of the animated end credit bee.The scenes in ""Bee Movie"" are very funny (Adam stinging Layton in the butt for example), as well as the exquisite cameo appearances by Larry King as a Larry King caricatured bee and such, and not to mention the superb dialog as well (Giraffe: You're not another lawyer too, are you? Mooseblood: Sir, I was already a bloodsucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.). Also, attached in front of ""Bee Movie"" in theaters, and as a bonus feature on the ""Bee Movie"" 2-Disc DVD was the PDI short ""Sleepy Guy"". For those of you PDI fans out everywhere, be sure to love several PDI cartoons much like ""Bee Movie"" again and again everyday."
115,Bee Movie,6,26 March 2008,Only for Seinfeld Fans,"I just want to give a shout out to all insect lovers that I HATE bees! They buzz all day and sting where if you don't pay attention to the types of bees, you can die! In 1998 we had two movies involving the lives of insects with Antz (The Woody Allen cartoon) depicting the lives of none other than ants while Disney's A Bug's Life showed all the insects living in a world.Now in Bee Movie, audiences get to see the funnier side of bees along with a strange story line of how bees get their honey. Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) lives in a beehive where its paradise from a home to a swimming pool of honey to hanging out with his buddy Adam (Matthew Broderick) in a colony where they work together until after graduation when both bees see that they have to work in the same place for the rest of their life as Barry wants to explore the world of humans. Barry meets a human woman name Vanessa (Renee Zellweger) who runs a flower shop where both the human and insect start talking. It may be animation and all rules can bend, but in the real world no insects can talk to a human after they sting them. The subplot in the movie involves Barry wanting to fight off the humans after seeing that the honey they use to live is being marketed for profit without the bees getting anything.""Bee Movie"" has it's hits and misses, but mainly misses where it feels like a movie for Jerry Seinfeld fans to a point where its like watching a animated rerun of Seinfeld in which you have to watch the show and live in Jerry's world to get the jokes."
116,Bee Movie,9,2 March 2008,An Awesome Movie that has a Lot of Buzzzzz,"Yes this movie is about bee's not that they are shown just buzzing about.But here they are actually shown as the hard workers that they really are. The viewers are treated to an insight into the actual lives of bee's and how if the bee's also were as technologically advanced as the humans would collect and make honey..The movie is extremely entertaining, it would be a special treat for kids as the movie has a lot of messages within...There are a few quirky scenes that u wouldn't find anywhere else on this planet.. But that is what animation is all about making the impossible possible..The voice over by jerry and Renee are extremely well done and also the plot line of the story has Barry(jerry) go through various emotions and thoughts..All in all a very enjoyable movie a must watch for all the kids and honey lovers out there P.S Sting and Winnie the pooh make an appearance in the movie so do a lot of other famous people.. Watch n find out Vatsal .... A.K.A.... DeAtHkNiGHt"
117,Bee Movie,4,25 January 2008,Honey Makes Money (Screen),"This animation movie offers, for one time, more to a mature audience than to kids. I can demonstrate it because I saw it with my family of adoption: the kids were disappointed (""not funny"") while us, adults were pleased.If the beginning is boring with the discovering of bee human-like society, the story evolves in a cute love-story and a original maturity tale: the disorientation for building a life, the feeling of exploitation, the class struggle, Well, it is a activism and political movie, so Dysney is out of field! I like this and his ""honey""!"
118,Bee Movie,7,13 January 2008,Kids loved it,"My kids loved this movie and so did my niece. It entertained them the whole time. And, I didn't mind it either. They liked it so much that I took them back to watch it again another time and they got the bee figurines from the shop. And now, they are very interested in bees. My kids are 2 & 4 years old and my niece is 7.This is a nice little movie that will entertain the kids & you fine. Like most animated kid's movies it's bright and visually entertaining, takes you to another world, there's a main character with plenty of heart, it's funny and there's a few messages in there too that go something along the lines of ""give everyone a chance even if they are different to you"", ""careful of what you wish for"" and ""take responsibility and do something about it when you realise that you've made a mistake"". It also has some standout cameos by Ray Liotta and Chris Rock. There's plenty of Jerry Seinfeld humour and he does a good job in his lead role. Actually, all the main characters are all likable and the actors behind them do a good job. This movie has something for the kids and something for the adults.Don't listen to the critics. The movie does what it's designed to do. It may not do it better than all the rest and it may at times seem unoriginal (to adults). But, if you take it on it's own merits and don't take it too seriously when you watch it then you won't be disappointed. My kids found it fascinating and I found it easy to watch. When it comes out on DVD I will be buying it. And, I'm sure it will come in handy on more than one occasion."
119,Bee Movie,8,26 December 2007,Polarized Opinion,"Wow, a whole lot of nattering nabobs of negativity seem to hate this movie - unrealistic depiction of male bees! confusing story! court-TV! talking bees! it's not Pixar-quality schmaltz! Seinfeld's not funny! Poor ""acting"", bad ""b-puns"". I guess some folks had a preconceived notion of the film and when it didn't meet them it was time to break out the slings and arrows. Our family, no preschoolers, enjoyed this movie and we all chuckled our way through it, it works well for what it is. Seinfeld was Seinfeld, some other actors poked fun at themselves or hammed it up, some silly, imaginative bee-world technology and the usual CGI soaring and swooping (now that's something that's getting CGI-tired in all movies). A good ball game doesn't have to be all home runs. Fresher, and certainly no worse than the mailed-in Shrek3."
120,Bee Movie,8,6 November 2007,"Mostly fun, at times hilarious, good for kids","I think some people are being too harsh on this movie. I think it deserves a 7, but I gave it an 8 to cancel out a 6. :)It's really fun most of the time. The characters are likable, there are no really scary parts to scar little kids like bambi's parents getting killed or the dragon in sleeping beauty or anything like that. It's got a lot of adult jokes hidden in there, but not sexually oriented like Shrek, and unlike Ratatouille (which I loved), I think little kids might enjoy Bee Movie more because it's faster and more colorful. And no matter how much you like the bees, when you see a bug bite the dust, it's just not that traumatizing... :)Sure, Bee Movie relies a little too much on puns sometimes (mostly at the beginning), but they get over it and you really start to like Jerry's little bee character, and Rene's florist too. And the bee really seems like all he wants to do is make a difference. The writers (Jerry, Spike, et. al) also know that the Shrek style of copying everything pop culture to create laughs is kind of cheap and old, and call it out during the Bee Larry King segment. They basically mock the entire foundation of shrek 1,2,3 which I suppose is fair because Shrek did the same to the Disney films. And many of the pop references in Bee Movie are far more timeless (like aping the Graduate swimming pool seen, for example). But the humor progresses more to observational/situational (which makes sense as the writers are standup/sitcom writers), of the ""you ever notice"" variety, and some of the observations are just hysterical.While some might call the story meandering, and it is a little bit, it's that structure that allows the result to sneak up on you. You don't expect it to lead to where it leads, and when was the last time there was an animated film that is not predictable?I think some people are confused by is the message of the movie. One thing this movie tries to demonstrate is that the path to ""heck"" is often paved with good intentions. I hear a lot about the so called environmental message here and how people won't eat honey ever again, but people seem to ignore the not so thinly veiled slavery/native American/holocaust reparations message, which is actually what the story is about. (heavy, right?) It's interesting that they show that if you take any of that too far (environmentalism or self flagellation if historical transgressions), you can hurt the people/cause you are trying to help in the first place, and damage yourself in the process.There are three themes that make it a solid fable: every action has a consequence, swift/ violent reactions are usually the wrong ones, and a everyone needs a purpose to their life.Those are really good messages people can talk to their kids about afterward. Or just take to heart as an adult if you have no kids. And best of all, they aren't politically motivated or shoved down your throat like everything else coming out of Hollywood these days."
121,Bee Movie,7,20 December 2017,Good Storyline and Casting,"You would think that a movie about bees would be very boring. But somehow, this story line makes it somewhat interesting in the fact that a bee is trying to sue the humans. And then after the bee successfully sues the human race for stealing the bees(all bees) honey, everything goes wrong.It just goes to show how important this movie really is and sheds some light on the importance of bees, which most of us hate because we think they are so useless. Another thing I like about the movie is the casting of it and the people that are in it. Jerry Seinfeld especially plays this part perfectly and his voice is the best. Any other voice would be inferior to his in really voicing the part."
122,Bee Movie,10,30 November 2017,saved my life,"Before watching the Bee Movie, I had clinical depression. My therapist recommended this movie to help through tough times. I said ""Yeah right, how will a movie about bees help me?"" Oh, I was sooo wrong. Ever since watching this movie, it has made me appreciate living more. I have spent more time with friends and family. I now am so confident in my life that I have a job. Thank you Jerry Seinfeld."
123,Bee Movie,10,12 November 2017,11/10,Great movie I love this romance it's emotional. It has such deep thoughts. the saddest part was when ken lost his girlfriend to the bee. he was very sad he got depressed he asked when will this nightmare end. the movie shortly ended afterwards ya like jazz he asked that was a first showing of barrys love for vanessa they eventually fall in love and start a business
124,Bee Movie,10,3 November 2017,beeutiful,"The Bee Movie recently came on Netflix, and me and my family decided to watch it for the meme. I largely enjoyed, but as the movie went on I noticed something sinister. The Bee Movie is fascist propaganda. My family thought I was insane but it's true. Let's look at the story here. Barry B. Benson, faced with the soul-sucking repetitiveness of proletarian life working for Honex, decides to try to free himself and goes outside of the hive. After doing outside stuff, he figures out that bees are being exploited by humans, because humans are expropriating their honey/surplus value. Barry, having achieved class consciousness, starts a lawsuit/proletarian revolution. Barry, with the help of the bee proletariat, wins. Post- scarcity is reached, and fully automated luxury bee communism is achieved. It should be paradise. However, this is not where the movie ends. Because of some bullshit mismanagement, bees just stop doing anything, including pollination. The world's vegetation begins to die, and Barry has to deal with the guilt of closing his class- traitor girlfriend's flower shop and spelling the end of life on earth as we know it. To solve the issue, the bees work with the humans to solve the crisis, and afterwards, bees continue to make honey and allow humans to use it. In other words, they solve their problems by ending fully automated luxury bee communism and promoting HECKING CLASS COLLABORATION. How dare Jerry Seinfeld imply that fully automated luxury bee communism would doom us? How dare he try to tell us that fascist class collaboration is the answer? Who knew that by watching and sharing increasingly accelerating apian cinematic memes we were helping the enemy? I don't beelieve it."
125,Bee Movie,10,19 September 2017,Bloody Brilliant,"An exceptional movie highlighting how a person's fate is not decided by society. Bee Movie was a emotionally captivating film that revolved around Barry, who tries to fend off society's plans for him and forges his own destiny. With the use of well placed humor and remarkable voice acting, Bee Movie left me hysterical and wanting to watch it again and again."
126,Bee Movie,,8 September 2017,As cringe as can bee,"Another poor entry from Dreamworks. 2007 is in my opinion is Dreamwork's worst year. After Shrek the Third earlier that year I didn't think it could get worse, but it did. This was so bad and unfunny. Everything was so mediocre in this movie. So forgettable. So boring. The animation is fine but the story and characters were lame. I bet the only reason this movie is full of memes is because it's so bad. I don't think anyone is celebrating it's 10th year anniversary."
127,Bee Movie,,1 September 2017,"So, a smart guy can make an idiotic script","It has probably started as an attempt to be Woody Allen Plus. Ten years later Seinfeld tries to do Antz. And fails miserably. There are a lot of silly jokes. Which are silly. And which are forced. And the end result is idiotic, worse than one of those End of the World movies that come out every Summer. Wait! This is one of those idiotic End of the World movies. Because the World is about to end, and we have a huge cast to save the day. Only this is ugly drawn and rudimentary animated. And they have to face it: they are at least a decade behind Disney.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"

Clever puns and subtle jokes for older minds.Now I'm not scared of bees Deapite horrible allergies.Dark humour and clever nihilism,Barry is my spirit animal. Film is good for laughs and passing aviation courses."
129,Bee Movie,10,18 August 2017,I'm so confused,"I honestly don't know how to rate this film. It is the most ludicrous, terrible, disastrously written, chaotic tornado of insanity I have ever seen, but at the same time I found myself laughing and enjoying myself out of sheer bemusement. No other film has so thoroughly thrown me. 10/10, simply because I have lost all power of rational thought."
130,Bee Movie,10,12 June 2017,Mixed thoughts,"Bee movie is a classic after all the attention it has gained online. However, the movie itself isn't that great. It has some great funny lines but the movie itself doesn't leave you in a feeling that will make you want to watch it again. However, I still do feel people should watch this."
131,Bee Movie,7,31 May 2017,"Cute, but unremarkable","What's there to bee said about the Bee Movie? I can't deny that it was pretty decent, but I can't say that it was great. It's a highly forgettable romp into the life of a single bee that changes the world. Who would be curious about the life of a bee? Maybe scientists, or interested specialists, but not the average person. But here we are.I really enjoyed the visuals. The inside of the hive and Manhattan on the sunny days were very impressive. It was bright and colorful. And I like bright and colorful. The voice acting was also very convincing. The actors did a very nice job at their roles, and they sounded pretty good. But with all these positives, there is a negative to go with it. To begin, the logic is very flawed. Bees aren't the only animals that can pollinate flowers. And although plant production would definitely be given a very large dent, surely all the flowers wouldn't die instantaneously over a couple of days. And there are billions upon billions upon BILLIONS of different bees out there, and you're only using, oh, I dunno... Only the bees that are in the state of New York, in contrast to claiming that you're using ""Every bee there is"". I may be nitpicking, but stating things like this, and correcting them, is very important. The ending didn't make me feel satisfied. It felt really rushed, honestly. So many plot elements were just rushing by and I couldn't keep on track for a good chunk of the film. All in all, the Bee Movie is not a bad movie at all! But it is incredibly flawed in several aspects, and I wouldn't call it great. However, I'd still recommend it and give it a 7/10."
132,Bee Movie,8,31 May 2017,Very hilarious movie,"This movie is a great family movie. It combines the aspect of silliness and creativity of a child's mind with the humor of an adult. although talking and living out a life style is not relatable, you feel as though you could fit right in with the animated characters everyday lives. the plot of the story is nice and the funniness of the movie plays right into it. It's nice to have that one movie that brings out your inner kid every time you watch it."
133,Bee Movie,8,1 May 2017,I need my niece,"Help I haven't been able to find my niece ever since I saw this movie. All that I found in her room was a note written with what appears to be honey that states ""If you want to see your niece again, give me the bee's knees."" I don't understand what this means but I need your guys' help I've linked my youtube page where you can contact please I need your guys' help ASAP. I need to find her, she was my favorite in more ways than one. My YouTube page is located here; redtube.com Thank you for caring about me and my personal problems. This movie was pretty good too i guess."

135,Bee Movie,3,9 November 2007,More B movie than Bee Movie,"For our money this is very weak movie making.Not really funny, or really clever, or really wonderful to look at it is instantly forgettable.There are more puns than quips and it lacks even a really good message - we found it all too silly, except me, who found it all rather irritating.There were a couple of good scenes - and we all liked Chris Rock, but talking about this afterwards it was really hard to remember lines that made us laugh, and it all felt forced. The animation is nothing new, the flying scenes are fun - but really it is all a bit old hat.Sorry, but when compared to say, Ratatouille, this is very much a B movie...Lacks sting and it too one dimensional - the court room idea is too boring for kids and not complex enough for adults - all in all no surprise. A real disappointment.If you think 5 year old would love Seinfeld (and this isn't even close to being as clever funny as that, but it is grown-up humor) then go ahead...Just don't say you weren't warned..."
136,Bee Movie,7,2 November 2007,"Funny and cute cartoon, that gets a little tiring by the end.","You can't go wrong by making a movie about a wise cracking bee who talks to people....well you probably can, but they didn't. ""Bee Movie"" is a clever and cute cartoon, with some great lively animation, and a plot that holds through until fairly close to the end.Jerry Seinfeld voices Barry Benson, a bee fresh out of school and onto a new career, but if you choose one, you have to stick with it until death. When he is given the opportunity to leave the hive, he does, and sees the real world. He is appalled by the way bees are treated, having humans take their honey, so he, along with the help of his new human friend Vanessa, sues the human race.It's actually quite a funny, if not corny (at times) movie. The voice acting is great and brought me back to the days when Seinfeld was on. Many actors make cameo voices, including Larry King, Oprah, Michael ""Kramer"" Richards, Sting, Ray Liotta, John Goodman and many others. Ray Liotta's cameo appearance is almost worth the admission alone. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, until about the last 20 minutes when the plot took a stupid turn, but picked itself up again for a fun ending. The movie also has many references that are fun to pick out, including ones of the Graduate and the Godfather.Bee Movie is great for kids, adults will enjoy some inside jokes, and fans of Jerry Seinfeld won't be disappointed.My rating: *** out of ****. 85 mins. PG for some mildly racial comments, and some mild violence."
137,Bee Movie,7,31 October 2007,Philosophical and comical,"It is a very nice movie. At first I was skeptical of watching this movie. But it turned out to be an hour and 20 minutes well spent. The movie has a good underlying message. It is funny and hilarious. I love the last scene with the mosquito and the cow. Movie was fast paced. It was not a drag. The animation is good too. A total family package movie. But as with other cartoon movies not watchable a second time. I loved the addition of Ray Liotta and Sting. Though not as comical as Monsters Inc or Ice Age Part I, it does make you laugh. It is colorful and philosophical in a lot of ways. It surely makes us feel that it is just not another Bug or Rodent movie. Very much comparable to the bug and ratoutille."

139,Bee Movie,,9 February 2008,Heart warming and fun,"This film is about a bee breaking the traditions by not following the footsteps of all the other bees in the past 27 million years. He sets out to sue humans for stealing honey, with disastrous results.I was very entertained by ""Bee Movie"", and I was surprised by all the negativity in the comments. I thought the animation was fantastic. The bees are cute and lovely, and the way Barry got ready to go out in the beginning is a joy to watch. I particularly liked the introduction around the hive. The colours were uplifting, and the mechanical machines in the hive. I felt as if I was really flying from a bee' perspective. And to look at the world with a bee's perspective is interesting. I also liked the morals of the story, especially Vanessa's line about all lives are equal. The subtle message about working hard (for 27 million years) to kids is not very attractive, but it is so subtle that I can live with it.I find ""Bee Movie"" heart warming and fun. Some lines are really funny, such as the final line about lawyers. The mobile phone with antennae is a great idea as well. I think ""Bee Movie"" is a great escape back to the child inside you."
140,Bee Movie,9,10 January 2008,Visuals so vivid it's almost extra-sensory; a must-see!,"A must-see! One of the most delightful animated flicks ever! Just like the efficient worker bees in Bee Movie, this is what happens when everyone does their role right: the cast, the director, the writers, editors, the animators, etc. Everything just hums along smoothly with nary a glitch.Bee Movie works even if it is heavily reliant on the incredible comic timing of lead bee voice-over Jerry Seinfeld, who delivers the laughs as his whiny but likable stand-up comic personality is retained even in cartoon bee form. He plays Barry Benson, a fresh grad who goes against the drones of bees who are satisfied working one job for the rest of their lives in the comfort of their hive. He ventures out into the dangerous world and meets florist Vanessa Bloome (Renee Zellweger), who saves his life and helps him sue the human race for illegally taking bee honey for their own profit. Matthew Broderick plays his best friend and sympathetic foil Adam.The impressive graphics of Bee Movie draw you in, making you feel like you're part of it. The visuals are so vivid it's almost extra-sensory; it would be great to see this in 4D where you can even smell the flowers, feel the rain, wind and sunshine, and taste the honey! It's hard not to tear up and feel emotional in several parts of the movie, no matter how incredulous the plot is, unlike in other recent animated disappointments such as Enchanted and Shrek the Third. The dialogue, animation and story all appeal to adults and children alike; all that help make Bee Movie immensely enjoyable!"
141,Bee Movie,10,3 December 2007,"Great, critics are trying to create a negative BUZZ because it's anti establishment","There is one simple fact. This movie is being smeared by the media because it is extremely anti-establishment (in its humor). This movie is fantastic.. you have to listen carefully for the small shots it takes at the establishment.For those who believed the negative buzz... did you think Seinfeld would release a piece of crap??? Seinfeld is only putting his time, effort and money into gold!I really recommend watching this movie. It is great and you'll enjoy it. Have I written 10 lines yet??I haven't. I tried to submit this but it is requesting more user comments. What else can I say? See it and judge for yourself!"
142,Bee Movie,6,27 November 2007,"Interesting, if slightly awkward animated romp...","Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):The idea of anthropomorphism is certainly nothing new in animated cinema, but in Bee Movie, written by comedy giant Jerry Seinfeld, one is driven to ask  is this one step too far? Bee Movie is essentially an allegory of human existence. Our protagonist, Barry Benson (Jerry Seinfeld), a bee, has recently graduated and become disenfranchised with the idea of making honey for the rest of his life. Through a series of events, Benson comes to learn that humans eat honey, and as such, endeavours to sue the human race. How such subject matter meanders into a children's film is a curiosity, and I find myself thinking that adults may better identify with the film's themes than the ankle-biting target audience.Bee Movie also employs a rather strange means of character modelling  the bee characters resemble human beings more than in any other film such as this, with even their skin tones closely resembling the white cross-section of society. When you combine this with the fact that the bees drive cars to work, it would at times become easy to forget that this is even a film about insects.As questionable as the film's content can be, the visual effects are undeniably impressive, although will be starkly overshadowed by the visual feast that is Beowulf. There are numerous scenes of distinct chaos, all of which are appropriately bombastic and colourful, and as such are easy to simply sit back and absorb.Whilst one doesn't expect moral complexity from a film such as this, the characters are incredibly black and white  the human who interacts with Benson, Vanessa (Renée Zellweger), is an exponent of animal rights, rather preposterously attesting that the life of a bee is as important as that of a human. Meanwhile, her boyfriend, Ken (voiced by Family Guy's excellent Patrick Warburton) is very much the opposite, and quite rightly, I found myself agreeing with his sentiments.Some of the inherent mechanics of Bee Movie's premise are materially strange  the fact that a bee alone can talk to a human is preposterous enough, but the fact that she can hear the minute sound that a bee is able to project is insane. Still, I see this not as an overt complaint  as a mechanic it is slightly clumsy and awkward-looking, but one soon gets used to it, and for whom this film ultimately concerns, they're unlikely to be bothered by it. However, there is one sigh-inducing instance, in which Benson is able to overpower a human in a mock ""sword fight""  whilst I don't necessarily expect a scientifically plausible film, this came close to destroying the barrier entirely. That said, without most of these divergences, we wouldn't have much of a film, would we now? As strange a choice as the premise is for a children's film, there are also a number of adult jibes that will undoubtedly zoom far over the heads of the target audience. There was a rather surprising blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference to sexually transmitted diseases (which left me unsure whether to laugh or fold my arms), and numerous cinematic references in Ray Liotta's brief appearance.The real gems of Bee Movie are the numerous cameo appearances, including Chris Rock (as a blood-hungry mosquito), John Goodman (a slimy, morbidly obese and melodramatic lawyer), as well as the aforementioned Ray Liotta, and Sting as themselves. There's even a bee version of Larry King, inventively named ""Bee Larry King"", an overly anthropomorphic character (in that he almost entirely resembles King to a tee), but Seinfeld makes light of this fact and its deliberation, so it hardly irritates.The idea of a bee taking legal action against the human race is about as preposterous a premise as one could excavate, and I largely expect that had Jerry Seinfeld or a similarly talented individual not appeared at the helm, then this project would have been thrown headlong into development Hell, or been given the red light from the outset. More to the point, the film's finale barely befits the tone of the proceeding hour, with a high-octane finale placing human lives at stake. Naturally, we know that there's never any real danger, and nobody will die in this film, yet it still feels like a cheesy, inane throwback to films such as Turbulence or about fifty direct-to-video action films, and worse still, the laws of physics are torn up, shredded, and shredded once more.As one can expect, everything returns to the status quo, the equilibrium is re-introduced, everyone gets their just desserts and the credits roll rather swiftly. Bee Movie is a feel good film by its end, but there's a decent amount of adult content so very tactfully slotted in between the bright colours and pretty rendered faces. Given the film's tone at times, with jokes about suicide pacts, I was half expecting the film to end with our sympathetic human protagonist turning out to be insane, having invented her conversations with the bee in her head, but alas, it wasn't so, which is a shame, as it would have made for a considerably more entertaining film.Bee Movie is one of the more intriguing animated films to surface in a long time  it's not that the film is outstanding in any aspect, but Seinfeld's brand of humour transposed onto and disguised as a children's film is either quite disconcerting, or incredibly smart on his part. The film is full of awkward action scenes, but each instance it falls down, it still manages to dazzle with slick, frenetic animation. Zellweger is appropriately irritating as the overexcited human protagonist, and the supporting cast, cameos and all, form most of what is enjoyable about Bee Movie. Seinfeld may need to reconsider who his target audience is, but this is an interesting and daring attempt at something a little different in the animated world."
143,Bee Movie,6,18 November 2007,"ends up working better than it should, thanks to Seinfeld and some irreverent puns and jokes","My expectations weren't very high for Bee Movie, but it somehow fulfilled what little hope I had that the star power would come through. Unlike Sharktale, where an equally admirable couple of talents combined voice-work (Scorsese and De Niro), Jerry Seinfeld, who co-wrote and co-produced the picture as well, has the right kind of attitude to change up the typical animated movie while not ever reinventing it. It's a tricky enterprise to recommend, because for kids it might have some wit to it that they might not really get, despite the color palette being almost as fresh as Pixar's Cars, and for adults there isn't the plethora of instantly quotable lines and unforgettable innuendo and eccentricities from the great 'show about nothing'. But considering that it's coming from a man who's never done a starring role in a movie, let alone an animated one, or that it's his first time attempting to write one, it's successful in a sense.That sense, really, is that a sort of sensibility from his stand-up comedy has carried over. All the little observations on the topic of bees and honey and what have you are covered, head to stinger, and a lot of the best moments are when the actors feel like they're riffing like on a stand-up stage. Although the actual storyline itself is kind of clunky and a little like a so-so children's book (save for the elements of the lawsuit and its outcome, which if one pay's attention to the news lately has even environmental relevance with bees and their connection to pollination), the filmmakers are able to straddle the line to make it worthwhile as a 'family' film, with equal bits of fun for young and old. Old, in the sense that the jokes about Ray Liotta, Sting, southern lawyers named ""Ali-Buy"", possible ethnically stereotyped bees (Barry's family, wee bit like his folks on Seinfeld), will get them more than the kiddies. Even when interest in the actual outcome of the situation grows a little weary, and a climax at an airport and up in the air doesn't completely work, little things just stick out very well.It's a vibrant, fast-paced CGI-feature, lacking the power and gravitas of a PIXAR film, but at the same time not stooping to the sophomoric levels that many another CGI movie (including the Shrek films) go for. Not exactly a very good movie, but very far from a bad one: it's like a Jerry Seinfeld concert special about bees, nothing but, and somehow, however unlikely, with a fairly charming performance as an actor- as opposed to the sitcom, where he was, more or less, playing himself in an equally crazy world. Other cool voice-work, by the way, from Patrick Warburton, Chris Rock, John Goodman, and Michael Richards."
144,Bee Movie,7,18 November 2007,Not About Nothing!  Bee Movie is Something Sweet,"Okay, so ""Bee Movie"" is not up to the animated magnitude of ""Ratatouille,"" the other animated movie about creatures we hate and fear the most, but are made in benign form thanks to these movies, but it is entertaining and will leave a smile on your face.Welcome back, Jerry Seinfeld. We missed you after 9 years of your legendary sitcom bearing your last name as the title. We still catch up with you on reruns and buy your DVD sets and never stop laughing. Jerry, your character, Barry B. Benson, I'd say, is a filmlike version of your TV persona. Both Barry and Jerry from TV are neurotics trying to figure out how to make it in society aided and abetted by friends and relatives.In Bee Movie Jerry has his cast working well with him. They are Matthew Broderick as his best pal Adam, Renee Zellweger as a human florist named Vanessa Bloome who realizes that bees have a purpose in life and are not out to hurt others, Seinfeld guest regular Patrick Warburton as Vanessa's bee-allergic boyfriend who wants to kill Barry, Kathy Bates and Barry Levinson as Barry's worrywart parents (and both sport glasses), and Chris Rock as a mosquito named Mooseblood. Throw in cameos by Oprah Winfrey as the no-nonsense Judge Bumbleton, John Goodman as the opinionated lawyer Layton Montgomery, and Sting, Larry King and Ray Liotta as themselves. Of course, there is the unforgettable Barry B. Benson, a graduate of the hive who becomes a lawyer and wants to rid the human race of stealing their honey, but after a courtroom trial, he would learn the hard way the true meaning of life of a bee.As in so many animated movies, all the actors are recognizable playing characters that best match their TV and screen personas, so you will have no trouble identifying them. It is best for Jerry to play a neurotic bee so the character would be convincing. See that? Now some of the jokes may go over the kids' heads, like why would Ray Liotta want to wipe out the bee race by stealing honey and putting his name on it as the brand, in a reference to Ray Liotta's movie roles as heavies. Otherwise, kids would enjoy the sweet nature of it and adults would pick up on in-jokes."
145,Bee Movie,,18 November 2007,"Buzzing Bee, Anyone?","Animation flicks these days have managed to pull in their fair share of adults what with their more sophisticated storyline and filming techniques.But this movie sadly takes a step back, both in terms of its production and plot. One will end up wondering how such plain fare could make it to the big screen.The laughs are few and far between and some of the subject matter is not really suitable for young children.I can't help feeling that this movie really doesn't know who the target audience is.The story centers on a young and restless bee named Barry Banson (voiceover by Jerry Seinfeld), who has just graduated from college. He is not too happy following in his footsteps as a stirrer and finds that bee are being forced to work too darn hard for their honey.In a trip outside the hive, he nearly gets swat but is saved by Vanessa, a florist. They soon become friends.Then Barry finds out that humans actually eat the honey which they 'steal' from the bees. So he decides to take the human race to court to force them to stop using honey. He wins the case but the consequences are far bigger than he realizes.A good splash of colors throughout the film, but nothing extraordinaire in terms of storyline."
146,Bee Movie,6,17 November 2007,I would have expected for more,"With such great actors in the cast, you might have thought Bee Movie would be so much different from other animation movies. Instead, the same old story - a single bee from the beechive has the revelation of their well planed but still boring life, so it tries to have a different one. It goes in the city, talks to a young woman, and eventually it even sues humanity for stealing their honey. If Antz or A Bug's Life are about animal societies without changing much of the way the little bugs really live, Bee Movie presents bees driving cars, bees able to talk to humans. You might find it funny, take your children with you if you want to go see it."
147,Bee Movie,7,10 November 2007,"A treat to watch, Seinfeld fan or not","Jerry Seinfeld is a bit of an interesting case to me. I used to hate his insanely popular TV series, but over time, have slowly become quite fond of it. And when I heard that he was prepping his own animated film to basically follow it up with, I was a little worried. But rather intriguingly, Seinfeld has pulled off quite the animated picture, albeit one that is distinctively Seinfeldian.In Bee Movie, Seinfeld voices Barry B. Benson, a young bee who just graduated from school (which seems to only take less than two weeks to complete). Disenfranchised from the whole idea of working the same job for the rest of his life within the hive at the Honex Corporation, Barry journeys outside the hive and what he discovers just may change bee/human relations forever.Even at its most ridiculous moments, Bee Movie packs a lot of fun into ninety minutes. Comical moments fly at every waking instance, and in some instances, are just absolutely riotous. I was not expecting a whole lot by way of genuine adult humour (disguised nicely like anything from Pixar, or just shoved in rather blatantly like in the recent Shrek the Third), but Seinfeld manages to land just enough jokes to impress even the most avid haters of his TV show. A lot of the humour is clearly Seinfeldian in its conception, but it manages to feel a lot fresher than one would imagine, especially from a stand-up comedian. It just has that pure comic zest that many writers search for, and can never quite nail down. Here, Seinfeld and company do it rather easily, and still have plenty of room left to continue on.But there are some downer moments joke wise, and a few that just seem like Seinfeld is trying to hit the young audience by bashing them over the head with his ideas. I realize the man is not subtle, but clearly children are either going to get the joke, or just laugh at some of the words the character ends up using because they sound remotely amusing. Seinfeld just does not grasp this at all time, and unfortunately, makes some scenes feel a little forced. Likewise, and not so much a criticism, but there is a bit too much dark humour for a children's film. A lot of the moments are clever and not too obvious, but some just stick out as being bad form for a children's flick. I appreciated it, and I know the people around me did, but when we are the only ones laughing in a room full of screaming five-year-olds, I think there may be an issue content-wise.But even with its off and on dialogue, the story still manages to be effective and rather clever and creative. Barry journeying outside of the hive is not all that original an idea, but some of the hijinx that ensue are. In a time where everything seems to be a ripoff of everything else (and a few scenes here are no different), it was nice to see some element of a film feel unique and original.The voice-work on the other hand, is a very mixed bag. On one hand, Seinfeld just does wonders embodying Barry. Even when the character ends up clearly being him, he manages to use his voice to project a certain finesse and gravitas that not a lot of big name actors can do when they do voice-work. If I had no idea who Seinfeld was, I might even have been inclined to think he was a voice actor all along (albeit one with a rather whiney Jewish sensibility about himself). He is not perfect by any means, but he does a really great job of providing his distinctive voice to a character I doubt could sound any other way.On the other hand, Seinfeld manages to outshine the entirety of the cast voice wise. His enthusiasm is unparalleled, and as a result, no one sounds as good as he does, and nobody even seems to be attempting to even try and match his level of intensity. In fact, the likes of Matthew Broderick do not seem to even care about how they sound. They just voice the part like any other, and seem to not really want to have any fun with it. Even veteran voice actor Patrick Warburton (who appeared on Seinfeld) does not seem to be having a whole lot of fun with his role, and usually his characters are some of the most memorable because of his voice work. I will say though, it was nice to hear Michael Richards voicing a character, bit part or not (although not so nice to not hear Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus or Larry David at all). Some of the wacky celebrity cameo voices like Chris Rock, Larry King, Sting and Ray Liotta were amusing to hear as well.The animation, as wonderful and vibrant as it is, is still not up to the par Pixar is setting. Yes, Barry is immaculately detailed. A lot of the bees look great too. But the humans he encounters just do not seem to have that jive about them. They look good, but when it comes down to precise and meticulous details (such as in the brilliantly detailed Ratatouille), they just do not have them. The cars driven by the bees (yes, bees drive cars within the hive) and the humans fare even worse, basically looking like small blobs on wheels. What happened to even attempting to compete in the animation market? Did Dreamworks concede defeat and not bother telling anyone? Because it sure looks like it. It still looks great, but it just does not attempt to overcome any barriers.Bee Movie, even with its problems, is still a treat to watch. I laughed harder and enjoyed the movie so much more than I could have imagined. I just wish they went a little further.7.5/10."
148,Bee Movie,10,5 November 2007,The Best of The Bees,I saw this movie today and it was one of the best movies that the people could of seen. The part that shows Bee Larry King is pretty cool and it was Larry King the voice himself. The voice of Mooseblood is pretty funny. Matthew Broderick voice of Adam Flayman is perfect. This story is about a bee named Barry B Benson. He found out that there where honey in the supermarket in New York. So just then Barry tells the people that they need their honey back. Just then the people free the bees and steal the honey from people like a costume of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet and many people. Just then the pollen was all gone no flowers and tree. So just then they went to a different state to go get flowers from the peoples car parade so they steal the Prince and the pea. Then there was storm in New York so the bees help the people on the airplane. So thats the story of a bee named Barry. This is an excellent movie you will like this movie and there are some funny parts.
149,Bee Movie,2,12 December 2007,Worst animated film of 2007,"Bee Movie is not only the worst animated film 2007.It is also one of the worst animated films from last years.First if all,this movie is a rip-off of Antz(a very mediocre movie,by the way).This crappy film tries to be funny but it fatally fails on that intention.It tries to be smart but it's very stupid.Bee Movie is extremely tedious and unfunny.The only reason I did not leave the cinema before it finished was because of my stupid optimism.But,I have to say that I looked to my watch very frequently and that I was considering in leaving the cinema.Also,there were moments in which I wanted to take my eyes out because this is painful to watch.The only reason I do not give this movie a 1 because of the effort hundred of technical artists made on the animation aspect.Bee Movie is a pathetic film and the worst thing the animation has given in 2007.If you wanna see a great animation movie,which is totally fun for kids and for adults,I totally recommend you Ratatouille."
150,Bee Movie,4,12 November 2007,Wait for the DVD release.,"I took my child to see this last night and I think it was a little over his head.There were a great deal of references to characters, people, and situations that are not currently relevant to my six-year-old.I also didn't enjoy the brief discussion about suicide and the pseudo-implied bestiality. These are not subjects that belong in a children's' movie.I definitely wouldn't recommend it for families with younger children.There were a couple moments that were funny, but once again, I laughed and my son didn't get it.Did enjoy Patrick Wharburton and John Goodman... they always do great character voicing."
151,Bee Movie,8,18 December 2016,A hilarious bee movie,"Released in 2007, ""Bee Movie"" is an animated movie about a bee, Barry B. Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld), a fresh college graduate who becomes disillusioned by his limited career choices in the hive. Upon taking a special trip to the outside world his life is saved by Vanessa (Renée Zellweger), a beautiful florist in New York City. As their relationship develops, he discovers humans actually harvest honey by enslaving bees; and understandably decides to sue humanity, but this has repercussions.I'm not big on animated flicks, but this one has frequent laugh-out-loud moments, particularly the first half. But you have to pay attention to the rapid fire dialogue and the details in the frame or you'll miss out on half the laughs. Consider for, for example, the ATFH officer (What's the 'H'stand for?). The second half remains compelling, but is more low-key in amusement. Bottom line: ""Bee Movie"" is one of my all-time favorite comedies. By the way, I know Vanessa's animated, but she's actually HOT.ADDITIONAL VOICES are supplied by the likes of Matthew Broderick, Patrick Warburton, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Kathy Bates, Barry Levinson, Larry King, Ray Liotta, Sting, Oprah Winfrey and Rip Torn.The film runs 91 minutes.GRADE: A-"
152,Bee Movie,10,27 October 2016,Good movie.,"This is the biggest piece of good I have ever seen the bee's performance as Jerry Seinfeld was better than something bad. You should watch it, it is good. This movie has John Goodman as one of the characters he is arguably a good actor.This movie's puns are better than the puns in bee movie the game and that's saying something bee movie the game is the single best game ever filmed, it is almost as good as the bee movie the movie which is of course one of the best movies ever written it questions the very existence of bees. Bee movie more like good movie that is better than any other movie ever made. Citizen Kane is really boring where as this movie is the best movie ever made I think Seinfeld should be making all the marvel movies."
153,Bee Movie,6,21 October 2016,Things Things this completely not sarcastically educational movie learned me,"Things this completely not sarcastically educational movie learned me: 1. Bees are so helpful they even build the title of the movie on a road, so a car is most likely gonna crash into it. 2. Bees have glasses and shoes. Where do they get glass and leather when apparently everybody works at Honex? 3. They have to watch birds and bats and bears, but they can't just communicate with the other animals. 4. They fly above a pond, but a fish doesn't eat them. And even if they could communicate with the fish, fishes are stupid as mud. 5. They fly by a bunch of kites, but they fly ABOVE THE BUILDINGS. They must have a LONG piece of rope. 6. Apparently bees are super intelligent, but why don't make a movie about monkeys or dolphins, species that actually ARE intelligent. 7. Bees are racist against other insects, because Barry reveals that he has a girlfriend to which his mother says ""I just hope she's a bee"". 8. Bees have houses inside their hive, but isn't the hive supposed to be their house? 9. Barry doesn't realize that stopping with making honey is gonna kill all plants. 10. Apparently trees will die to without bees"
154,Bee Movie,10,6 June 2016,A cult classic,"The plot contains zero holes and is utterly flawless and an instant cult classic the will bee studied for generations to come. I don't know what will beecome to this films legacy as it get older but it'll probably just get stronger and stronger. the movie follows Jerry Seinfeld and a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being ""a movie about nothing"".I rate this 10/10 and would watch and rate again."
155,Bee Movie,6,1 January 2011,"Colourful, with some sassy and smart moments, but it peters out in the last half","This is far from the worst movie ever(Disaster Movie) or the worst animated animated movie ever(Titanic:The Animated Movie), but despite its neat concept Bee Movie doesn't completely hold together consequently it is one of Dreamworks' weaker movies, Shark Tale being their worst.Granted, there are things to like. The animation is gorgeous. The character designs are good enough, but the colours and backgrounds are the real revelations, as well as some of the visual gags. The music is a nice touch as well, the orchestral music is bright and breezy and the song in the end scene was lovely. I also loved the concept, and in the first half the film did work really well with it. It was original and well-written up to a certain point. The script in general is sassy and smart with the odd amusing pun, the pace to start with is brisk and the voice acting is solid with Jerry Seinfeld energetic, Renee Zellwegger warm and endearing and an assortment of effective cameos especially Ray Liotta's.However, the film's problems come in the second half, and the start of those problems are with the courtroom scene which came across as forced and only slightly funny. Storywise, the last half hour feels like a different movie, first it is all warm, smart and infectious then it is close to serious and heavy-handed, and it also seemed as though the writers had run out of ideas. While there are some good jokes, others aren't so funny as it is the sort of humour that goes over the audience's heads, and the pace sags quite badly towards the end.All in all, it isn't bad but it could have been better with a tighter second half and a more consistent set of ideas. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
156,Bee Movie,,22 February 2009,"Watchable but nearly plot less, only mildly amusing","Bee Movie is mildly amusing. The opening fifteen minutes while we are in the bee hive work well. However, once Barry Bee (Seinfeld) leaves the hive and talks to Renee Zellweger, the laughs become surprisingly sporadic. The long courtroom trial isn't particularly interesting. This film seems to be a high concept film that was started without a script. There is no character development and the weak plot exists merely as an excuse for some mildly diverting jokes. Seinfeld is alright and so is Zellweger, but they don't really have much to do. The animation quality is decent but could have been better.Overall 5/10"
157,Bee Movie,6,7 November 2008,It doesn't cut it with a lot of recent films of this type but that's no real reason to despise it.,"Bee Movie has that typical set up that we've see in many other computer animated films of recent years. A small hero (usually male) inhabits a world in which all is perfect in its systematic working and setting; a resemblance of a world in which everything within the boundaries of home is 'good' and works to an efficient degree whereas most things outside of it are strange, unknown and to be left alone. Monster's Inc. had its factory fuelled by 'screams'; Finding Nemo had its patch at the bottom of the sea of which Nemo's father inhabited with Nemo following a prior tragedy involving family death and now Bee Movie has its hive in which pollen is brought in and honey is produced through an array of different machines and methods.The film is a strange beast, combining those enjoyable and surreal aspects CGI animated films brings to the genre of animation revolving around fish or monsters or toys living side by side with humans in the real world. It's fun to think monsters use kid's closets to capture screaming so that they can survive and it's equally fun to assume bees are producing masses of honey under factory like conditions with advanced machinery. But Bee Movie's audaciousness is its own downfall; blurring the boundaries between what's real; surreal; fun and just plain stupid. Eventuallu, the film will have the species that is 'the bee' take human beings to court in a gross misjudgement of narrative as well as humanise one of its characters enough to kick up a potential love story.The film begins with that usually enjoyable and comic point of attack films like Monster's Inc. and Finding Nemo et al present. Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld) is a bee living in the hive complete with family and friends. He graduates and his career decision is left up to a lottery of sorts in which he has to decide over an ever changing timetable what his job will be for life  there is no going back. If Bee Movie were not a fun, family friendly Dreamworks production then it might well be a horror film about insects that have become too self aware of what's going on outside of their realm  think 1954's 'Them!' but with bees and more of a grudge.So this point of attack that usually consists of jokes and visual gags to do with the universe these creatures (fish, closet monsters, bees) inhabit actually works quite well in Bee Movie. Bees have invented television and can predict the weather, if you can get your head around that, and have a perfectly planned out system of producing and texturing honey. Then the character ventures outside of its realm, similarly to Nemo being fish-knapped or the human venturing into the monster's world and threatening to undo all the good that is the safe haven. Here, Barry ventures out after a lacklustre and rather obvious motivation to do with a confrontation with pollen collectors. The pollen collectors are physically bigger than everyone else and have big booming voices; they are the military of the establishment, the brave few who risk life and wing in the real world of which it is vastly unsafe compared to life in the hive.The film sees Barry leave the hive in an attempt to prove himself but the film does not go down that route of self discovery, nor does it seem too bothered about failing to set up a clear cut goal such as finding nemo the fish or getting rid of the kid human. Instead, Barry ends up meeting Vanessa Bloome (Zellweger) and begins to love her. It's here that the wheels threaten to fall off because while I'm fine with inter-species fondness in animated films; since the child human and John Goodman's monster in Monster's Inc. took on father/daughter ideas, here in Bee Movie it just doesn't quite work.But this is before the discovery that honey is being sold in supermarkets and this is where the bolts on the wheel twitch a little. The courtroom scenes basically pit ""us versus them"" as one of Barry's friends put it earlier on; humans vs. bees and I know whose side I'm on. But it's not the alienation the audience will get with the film's protagonist that's the problem here, it's the daft cameos from Sting and Ray Liotta who I'm sure were paid lashings of money just to be mocked. It's also the bumbling and physically tumbling character of lawyer Layton T. Montgomery (Goodman) whose rear end fills the screen in a pathetic attempt to evoke some sort of laugh from the kids watching on. The scene is also a disappointing set up for Barry's friend Adam (Broderick) to try and resist stinging him; something that will pump the story into its final third and give its hero Barry a further drive for success.So following all that's said and done, Bee Movie transgresses into a chase movie of sorts right towards the end. The outcome of the court case sees the hive stop production and descend into farce, perhaps a message along the lines of: without strict law, order and routine in a ruling utopia there can only ever be chaos. The mock political imagery of a Saddam Hussein statue being pulled down and the bees resembling F-16 fighter jets as they aid a jumbo jet airliner in distress is a little clumsy in the sense it is content the makers are consciously including for means of entertainment. Bee Movie may end badly and get progressively clumsier in the middle but it ends when it should, not outstaying its welcome, and acts as an average animated film that may well evoke a few chuckles anyway."
158,Bee Movie,7,20 September 2008,"Good, NOT great film","I did like this movie. Kind of disappointed, thought it would be funnier.It was a good effort by Jerry. Took him all the years between the show going off the air in May 1998 to this films release in November 2007 to have a major release of anything. I am NOT a fan of Re'nee Zellweger?s. At least you did not have to see her & that horrible hair cut she has had the past couple of years.Jerry working again with Patrick Warburton (David Puddy). He has be doing a lot of voice work this decade, notably on ""Family Guy"".Matthew Broderick not quite up to the standards of your big animated voice work, the great 1994 ""The Lion King"". That was a part to be remembered. Animation is great to look at, colorful."
159,Bee Movie,6,1 September 2008,"""That's a drag queen!""","PLOT: Barry B. Bensen (voice of Jerry Seinfeld) is a young bee who has just graduated from bee college and now has to pick a job that he will work for the rest of his life, in the tradition of bee culture. However, Barry does not like the idea of having only one job for the rest of his life and isn't sure what job to go for. Before choosing a job, Barry decides that he wants to see the world outside the hive so he manages to hitch a ride, or flight, with the Pollen Jocks, big burly bees who go out and gather the pollen and what not for the hive to make its honey. While out there, Barry gets separated from his fellow bees and finds himself in the home of a human florist named Vanessa (voice of Rene Zellwegger). Vanessa saves Barry from being squashed by her neurotic, ego-maniacal boyfriend Ken (voice of TV SEINFELD alumni Patrick Warburton), and he decides to break bee law by talking her so as to thank her for her good deed. Barry then decides to pursue a friendship with her, which leads to him discovering that humans have been exploiting bees for sometime so as to get the honey that bees make for their own purposes. Barry does not like this and decides to sue the human race so as to get back the honey & avenge the mistreatment of bees everywhere. Surprisingly, Barry wins, but only to have his well intentioned deed come back to bite him in the ass (or stinger) when the bees, who now have more honey than they know what to do with, stop doing their jobs, thus throwing the entire ecosystem into chaos. Without the bees, trees/plants/etc start to die off, which in turn endangers Vanessa's job and the world in general. Can Barry reverse things in time? For the most part, an amusing, good natured little farce, but a lot of it will probably depend on whether or not you like Jerry Seinfeld and his style of humor. As far as the voice acting goes, Seinfeld himself brings a lot of energy & enthusiasm to his role as the easily excitable yet witty Barry B. Benson, but his nasally voice doesn't really lend itself to voice acting an animated character. The other actors play their parts well enough.Not a classic, not a bad effort overall, but definitely not on par with something like the Incredibles."
160,Bee Movie,6,26 June 2008,Look! It's Bee Jerry Seinfeld!,"He made one of the most memorable sitcoms of all time and is of course one of the top stand-up comedians of the 80s and 90s. Is it worth to see him doing an animated movie? Well, you can't say that the idea of doing a cartoon about bees is terribly original (Disney certainly did it once and twice before) and because Seinfeld is in it the bee talks. How could you make a movie with Seinfeld and not have him talk, although that would have been interesting.Seinfeld is no dummy, though. He made sure that there were plenty of acting talent to back him up, like Matthew Broderick (I couldn't even tell it was his voice at the start) and Renee Zellweger and especially the hilarious Matt Warburton. There is no way for Warburton to not be funny and his character is the funniest in the movie.I was a little surprised that Seinfeld didn't include much of his stand up persona into Barry Benson. Barry naiveté is very un-Seinfeld like. But it was probably a wise choice. Who wants to see more of Seinfeld, the sitcom character for the millionth time? The animation is the best Dreamworks has done so far. All the images have a lush, spectacular look to them. They come very close to a Pixar movie. The human characters are a bit dodgy with their huge heads and eyes as big as a Simpsons character. But those are minor things that you can quickly gloss over because of the tremendous voice work by Zellweger and Warburton. I think this is Zellwegers best performance and she won an Oscar for chrissakes.So, I wasn't completely going: ""This is magnificent!"" but it was a nice experience. The problem is maybe that computer animated movies are more common than 10 years ago, so it is tough to top what has done before."
161,Bee Movie,6,16 April 2008,A decent animation with not much impression,"Bee Movie tell us the story of an young bee who stands in front of the crossroad of his life when he graduates and has to choose his career. To make his decision, he flies outside, sees the world, meets human, has accidents and eventually decides to sue human for using bee honey illegally. The story is good, enriched by some humour & intelligent dialogues. The visual meets current standard of digital movie, with some gorgeous scenes. The audio is also nice although the voice cast should be better. It seems there is a lot of positive aspects, but the movie itself as a whole leaves me no impression. It's predictable and routine. It is nice, but far from great. I can only recommend Bee movie for some free time when there is no other animation to watch. If you try to watch the movie for the second time, you'll find yourself pushing ""fast forward"" more often than you usually do, not because it's a bad movie, but because we can hardly find something in the movie that can stay in our memory for long.Bee Movie is a well-made animation, but sadly, a passable one."
162,Bee Movie,5,4 April 2008,Bad second half and plot with very little depth,"I was originally not an animation fan, but Finding Nemo changed my perspective of animation movies. So there I was, sitting in front of the BeeMovie, hoping that it would be just like one of those Pixar quality animation with a deep storyline and great humour.Sadly, BeeMovie lack the former. The overall plot had a main theme, but it lack depth. The story for the first third of the movie was good, but then it all started to fell apart. The part where our main hero, Barry discovered honey are sold in supermarkets at large quantity was the tipping point, in my opinion. After that, the plot was a bit rough and disjointed, with light jokes filling up the rest of the two third of the movie. It feels as if the production has been rushed and many rough edges unpolished.The only consolation from this movie was a good ending song, with a decent first third of the movie. The details of a bee hive given in the movie was great, for that I have to give them credit.For animated films, I think the plot and sound effects of the movie are the main defining point of the movie. Without those, animations would just be not worth watching. BeeMovie did fine with the sound effects, but the plot was a rushed one.Overall, I think this movie is watchable, but it is nowhere near Pixar quality animation. If you have time to kill, go ahead and watch it, otherwise, skipping this movie really does no harm."
163,Bee Movie,6,31 March 2008,Man am I Bee-gining to hate these bee jokes,"The movie itself was very good and fascinating for the first forty minutes or so. The movie was fasted-paced which kept the movie short and sweet ( Man thats annoying). But then the movie blasts like weeks into the future when Berry is suing the humans. Right when this happened is when I stopped liking the movie and it turned into something that made me want to shut off the movie and watch something else. I'll admit the court part was funny ,like with Sting. But the movie really failed when the bees held up the plane. It's fine when other animals or insects and other things does something amazing but Jerry didn't know how to work out this part. Now Diseny has mastered that technique long ago. Kudos to the ending, it was fine but it was deceiving when the honey was bee-approved it made you wonder if all honey was still illegal. The part that I thought was funny was the part where the mosquito made that lawyer comment to the cow."
164,Bee Movie,7,10 November 2007,"Think Less, Enjoy More","Perhaps because I don't watch TV, I didn't have any expectations. Aside from seeing the ""human"" Larry King interview, I had no hints of what to expect with this movie.My 4 and 7 year olds were silent through this entire movie. That's enormously significant. Regardless of how an adult might rate this movie, it was apparently engaging enough to keep my kids busy, and therefore my rating is fairly high :) As an adult, I enjoyed it. There was nothing that annoyed me, and the humor was mostly funny.Take this as a light-hearted, fun movie and run with it. If you like details, appreciate the enormous energy put into it by the graphics programmers and artistic designers."
165,Bee Movie,6,2 November 2007,It was fine,"I'm not a fan of Jerry Seinfeld, by any means. Sure, his show had some funny moments, but it wasn't 'gold' in my opinion. Also, Renee Zellweger bugs (no pun intended) me beyond belief. That being said, I bit the bullet and took my 2-year-old to see Bee Movie. The last film we saw in the theater was Ratatouille (which she wasn't interested in AT ALL). Naturally, DreamWorks pictures don't hold a candle to Pixar, I know where my loyalties lay...BUT Bee Movie wasn't bad. I appreciate a film w/ humor for the adults so we're not bored. This movie was entertaining...I enjoyed the Larry King cameo a great deal! Also, Sting and Ray Liotta poking fun @ themselves was classic. The film is FULL of color which was something (I feel) Ratatouille lacked. Jerry Seinfeld was his 'typical' self, which if you're not a Seinfeld fan, will annoy you. Zellweger, however, has a FANTASTIC voice. She's far less annoying when you can't see the weird faces she makes! She was really good in the film. Of course, Patrick Warburten is amazing, as always, and even Matthew Broderick's sniveling Adam was fun to have around. All in all, I found this movie to be pretty good!"
166,Bee Movie,1,3 December 2016,Meh.,"the animation is pretty good. i guess. but honestly it makes no sense and also MALE BEES Don't HAVE STINGERS i know thats a very small detail but it really bugs me so im mentioning itnow i also should mention things i really hate about this movie: -bees don't have yellow heads -bees wearing black and yellow clothing is like me wearing all pale clothing -the bee puns -everything is prefixed with ""bee"". its not like we have ""human laws"" and we don't call the way we live ""the human way"" -bees don't have hair -jerry seinfeld -there is no way bees would win that case. all their arguments were so petty -their facts are outdatedthank you for reading"

168,Bee Movie,3,21 November 2016,Would not recommend,"I can't believe I subjected my children to this horrible excuse for a movie. For a start I personally thought the choice of voice actors was atrocious for such a high end 'children's' movie, but that didn't bother my children of course (only me). What did bother my children was the very short duration of the movie and the ridiculously fast pace of speech that was impossible to follow. How are my 3 year old and 6 year old meant to understand this? The beginning was comprehensible but as the movie progressed it became harder and harder to know what the f**k was going on. However on the plus side, there was some very nice colours and visuals and the first 30 seconds were enjoyable. At least the link was high quality.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6iN6VTL7v8 :)"

170,Bee Movie,5,31 October 2016,Meh.... right down the middle,"OK reviewing the bee movie is a difficult one for me because I hate it... lol the movie has so many contradictions and non believably it's pretty ridiculous, yes I know it's a cartoon but it's really cringy - but above all I cannot stand the voice of the main bee, especially when he's getting all dramatic in court fighting for the bee rights! I'm not sure how you cast a voice for a bee but I am pretty sure they gave the part to the wrong person! The part where the bee lands the plane I find incredibly cringe worthy! It really is an annoying movie. However it is a children's movie and what I will say is that they succeeded in making it work for children - mine at least. The bee movie is one of the very few movies I can put on and my 2 year old will sit and watch from start to finish, it was a god send when he was poorly because it was one of the few things that cheered him up. So right down the middle for us, I can't stand it but my son loves it - it's a movie for parents that own ear plugs! Lol"
171,Bee Movie,9,6 January 2009,It was totally Fun and Superb,"The movie was totally fun and superb. Amongst the bees, Barry was totally cute and funny. The factory and the city inside the hive, was totally beautiful and cool. When, the pollen jocks are taking nectar from the flowers, that scene is totally cool and awesome. Even, the last scene was totally awesome, cool and funny. Even, the other bees were also cute but not like Barry. Even, the town outside the hive was also beautiful and colorful. Whenever, Barry is flying outside that scenes are totally thrilling because we think Barry will be dead and the flying of the bees are very beautiful and they are cool. When, Barry is fighting with a man by using his sting and the man uses a pin, that scene is totally awesome and cool. When, Ken wants to kill Barry, that time he uses flames and books to kill Barry, that scene was cool. When, Barry is talking to Vanessa for the fast time in the kitchen, that scene was funny. When, Barry becomes a big man and a lawyer that scenes are very funny and he becomes a pollen jock that is cool and superb. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Bee Movie""."
172,Bee Movie,9,21 November 2008,"Get a grip, it's a cute movie","My whole family loves this movie! My three-year-old would watch it over and over again all day if I allowed him to do so. Why get so hung up on realism?? Enjoy the story, enjoy the multiple movie references, and allow yourself to suspend disbelief! It's just a silly, fun movie for kids.The lesson, by the way, is one of the symbiotic relationships which surround us on this Earth. Barry thinks it's an outrage that humans are taking honey for their own consumption, but after he wins the lawsuit he discovers that it's in everyone's best interests that humans continue to help themselves to the honey. Children learn to appreciate nature's plan for each species and realize that whether or not it makes immediate sense to us, it is God's way of keeping us all going.Take a deep breath and just enjoy the movie!"
173,Bee Movie,6,7 April 2008,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Bee Movie (2007),"A good kids movie with great animation that takes an unexpected turn about half way into the film.The film was a light and funny children's film with great visuals and good voice acting. That is until our main character Barry B Benson(Seinfeld)sues the humans for eating there honey. From there its a law themed kids film. For a movie that is meant to be for kids this unexpected turn makes Bee Movie feel sour. But luckily it takes an unexpected turn back to its light and funny side in the ending.Just a word of advice. If you are one of those film lovers that are expecting this to be a throw back to Seinfeld days then i would go somewhere else.One thing i found to be irritating is the way the humans react when the bee talks. If you saw a bee talking would you just say ""ohhhhh"". It is quite silly.I didn't expect this have the content it did. There are references to sex. I did not expect it.Apart from its cons this is a good kids film. I do recommend it.6/10"
174,Bee Movie,7,7 April 2008,Answers Many Bee Questions,"When first looking at the trailer, I did not have much high hopes for this film. I was thinking maybe a cross between Antz and try to be cute bugs life. However, the second I popped in the DVD, I realized that this movie was different. The story tells of a bee named Barry who questions what he wants to do as a job. As the pressure increases, he decides to leave the hive and meets Renee zelwegger's (sorry for the spelling) character, who actually shows him true friendship. Despite some little boring moments in the film, I found that it was humorous and a nice ride as you join Barry and his fellow bees soar into the sky. So don't take negative reviews to seriously, this movie is actually worth the watch, maybe even with your kids or little brothers, sisters, and or even relatives. Its fun, interesting and even provides a positive message that some people underestimate. If your still thinking of watching it, think like a bee."
175,Bee Movie,8,13 December 2007,Bee movie more like B+ movie,"My next M/G review after: ""Happy Feet"" Bee Movie is Basically familiar. Right? Yes. It's kinda like it but with different Chracthers. But the this one's is better and nothing beats it. It's also from Dreamworks Originally. I really have nothing much to say, but I'm gonna keep the review short today. This cartoon I'll give is a B-. Here the results: Voice-acting: A 9.0/10.0 Great and Funny.Animation: A++ 10.0/10.0 Wonderful, Colorful, Clean, and Technically Perfect! Graphics: A++ 10.0/10.0 Same as the Animation! Sound: B 8.0/10.0 Impressive.Dialouge: C+ 6.5/10.0 Some parts are funny, but otherwise Boring.Lasting Appeal: B+ 5.0/10.0 it grows on you.Overall: B- 7.0/10.0 As If Dreamworks can Possibly make more movies like this one, because they did it with This one and Shrek the Third, It would be Perfect. That's the end of my review. Good day Everyone."
176,Bee Movie,7,5 December 2007,Don't know really for whom this movie was made,"Jerry Seinfeld isn't really known for being anything BUT Jerry Seinfeld,so when I first became aware of this movie(sometime in early summer of 2005,and they were doing preview trailers BACK THEN!)I was quite intrigued to see this,since this was a project that was going to be a combination of two elements that interest me:animation and Seinfeld(both the show and his stand-up). I wasn't going to be deterred,as this show neared,then opened,by the criticisms of the show,steeling myself to think that I would catch this show out of curiosity and moderately low expectations.That was probably the right move.Don't get me wrong:for the most part,I thought this movie was an entertaining diversion. Seinfeld is BArry B.Benson,a seemingly average young bee who graduates schooling and is readying to go into the hive workforce when it occurs to him that he might want more out of his life than being an average worker bee. When he travels into the world outside the hive,he is awed by the larger,mostly human-dominated world,but later comes to realize that the very product he and his fellow bees make(take a wild guess what that is)is being exploited by humans for large profit. With the help of a charming,friendly(and reasonably sexy for a ""family""film)florist named VAnessa(voice of Renee Zellweger),he endeavors to sue humanity for abuse and misuse of his kind and the honey they make. With enough biological inaccuracies to cause buzzing(sorry for the pun)among a number of viewers and non-viewers,and perhaps a little TOO ambitious in scope for its own good(though not as off-the-tracks in that regard as,say,HAppy Feet),this show's strength really IS in Seinfeld,his gift of gab,smart,fast humor and his interplay with other bees(notably his parents and his brother<?> Adam,voiced by MAtthew Broderick)and the human element he encounters(most of it being with Vanessa),I'm afraid that the main strength of this film is the exact thing that could be identified as its weakness:namely,that this film is going to be too over-the-heads of kids in verbal humor,too simplistic and cutesy(thought that's forgivable for animation,I suppose)for many,if not most,adults. THerein lies my summary line. Co-written by Seinfeld and ""Seinfeld""co-producer and scribe Spike Feresten,this movie seems to have a little too much adult sensibility to be considered easy family fare,but just enough eye candy animation to keep it in that park. The animation is technically sound and the colors are brilliant,but the entirely computerized(by HP,which is even noted in the credits)images seem to lack some warmth. Directors Steve Hickman and Simon J.Smith have great eyes for visual chase and proportion,but I don't think they gave much thought to how much plausibility would be divined out of this show. I suppose one,going into or(eventually)renting this film has to approach this as a hybrid curiosity of a film:a film for the whole family that is going to be understood and appreciated at different levels for each member(assuming its appreciated at all). I hope Jerry tries more endeavors,maybe even like this one,but hopefully with a better idea of what level it can settle at."
177,Bee Movie,3,24 November 2007,Most boring animation I've seen so far,"This movie has got to be the most boring animation I've ever seen yet. I think the only group that may find it interesting may be the kids group but as an adult I found this to be the least entertaining animation I've ever seen it. It tries to be funny but the jokes are far from hilarious, in fact in lots of parts I found it to be trying way to hard to get a laugh... I also found Jerry Seinfeld's voice to be a terrible choice as his voice just does not suit a bee's voice.. if a bee could speak it definitely would not sound like jerry seinfeld.. all in all this was one of the most boring animations i've ever seen... i wouldn't even recommend it to be rented on DVD.. just download it on bittorrent or something"
178,Bee Movie,5,20 November 2007,"could have done better, Jerry","I felt the lack of consistency in the story. I realized at some point that the whole idea was just to leave it up to Seinfeld and the animation; on the amusing little stuff that animals/insects/monsters do or say in cartoons and just make us feel like they're just like human. The script was just bad, the story was not something you would tend to believe in a movie/cartoon, the idea behind the story was improvable.... I must admit, I never thought that Jerry S would resurrect and when I heard about this one, I knew that it's gonna be big and smart and funnier than ever. But I'm sure it was not just my high expectations.Can't say a kind word, can I?:)"
179,Bee Movie,8,12 November 2007,Surprisingly enjoyable,"Hollywood has to start making better previews. Stop telling me the whole story, and please do not show only the dull, uninspired moments. There have several films that died a quick death because the advertising campaigns were truly uninspired, and ""The Bee Movie"" was almost one of those films. Last year's ""Flushed Away"", a much better movie had way more original moments, much better acting and story, and it suffered a terrible fate, as it now collects dust in the back of video stores. Whoever designed ""The Bee Movie"" preview must have been totally enamoured of the main actor in the film, as that was all we saw. None of the clever and cute work that is obvious in the final product was there, but just a dried and listless collection of bits that have little connection to the heart of a sweet film.In ""The Bee Movie"" there is much to admire from the good vocal work by Seinfield who leaves his dry and boring funny man behind to create a character with hopes, dreams, and well, fears. There is a good story that takes us from the monotonous and perfect world of the hive into a world that is both terrifying and wonderful to our little hero. There are some classic moments as we follow his journey and thankfully see how the gags that have sunk other animated movies are in the proper supporting place.This film might not rank as one of the best examples of the golden age of animation, an honour that this year goes to the beautiful execution and writing of ""Ratatouille"", but ""Bee"" is enjoyable, funny, sweet, and ready to find an audience, a much better audience that the studio people who produced those previews seemed to have in mind.""Bee"" happy."
180,Bee Movie,5,12 November 2007,Nothing Special,"Jerry Seinfeld makes an attempt to jump back into the limelight since ending his tenure on the hit sitcom Seinfeld in 1998, this time in the always marketable world of children's computer animated films. Since Jerry was aware how he could easily cash in on this genre and obviously thinks he needs more money than he already has, it seems he also realized that he could easily influence children on his views and intentions since he's responsible for orchestrating this film. It may have not been the best decision for Jerry Seinfeld to return back to the limelight after almost a decade by trying to cash in on the Computer Animated industry though most people don't seem to mind that and America has welcomed back the former Sitcom giant with open arms. While critics have bashed this film, the majority of people that disagree with critics are parents looking for a family-friendly film to please their kids and are obviously the ones writing the positive reviews on this website.From my vantage point the film is a very inane idea that is obviously a part of the recent children's computer animation craze taking place in the film market. Here's what the plot line comes down to: The story involves an ambitious protagonist Barry Bee Benson (An unoriginal randomly chosen name that producers thought would be appealing to children and sure enough is) who isn't sitting too comfortably with the fact that after graduating from college he has to choose one job in the honey hive for the rest of his life. His ambitions take him outside of the mundane career fields of other bees and into that of an occupation of Pollen Jock. The Pollen Jocks mock his attempts in becoming one of them because he's not built up physically to look the part. He seems so resistant to getting a job in the hive that he winds up traveling with the Pollen Jocks to leave the Hive for the first time and explore the marvelously beautiful world of New York City. There he meets up with the generous female lead Vanessa played by Renee Zellweger (Who uses a strangely slurred pitch voice to play her character). Saves Berry's life from Patrick Warburton's abusive and obnoxiously irreverent character Ken who seems to be one of many antagonists throughout the film. Berry and Vanessa build up a relationship. Then Berry reveals to his family and close friend Adam played by Matthew Broderick about his adventures of communicating with humans outside of the hive even though its against bee rules to do so. While continuing to see Vanessa the most bizarre subplot emerges where Berry sues Honey Farms, a bee plantation, for exploiting bees and using the honey that the bees worked for. This is where the second antagonist emerges, Layton T. Montgomery a southern lawyer (With deep classic Southern drawl) has many tricks up his sleeve to reassure his client, owner of the Honey Farms that they have the case in the bag. During the case there are stupid inside jokes such as blaming celebrities in part for the lack of respect humans have for bees. After all of this takes place Berry emerges victorious and wins the case, because he relates bears and smoking machines to the atrocities humans have caused for bees. Though Berry's plan to sue and overthrow the Honey companies backfires when the bee's have enough surplus of honey to never work again causing a climate shift resulting in a skeletal dried up environment. To prevent this disaster from going any further, Berry with the help of Vanessa go to the Tournament of Roses to retrieve the last remaining flowers on the planet thereby re-pollinating the world's flower supplies and bringing the world back to its former self, a beautiful lush environment of trees plants and prosperous bees. This is basically an indirect message of how not to pollute the environment and a reference to the recent collapse in the bee colony population. This may be the reason why this film came to be and why Jerry Seinfeld chose this kind subject matter for this children's film. Jerry seems to be in with a clique of Hollywood liberals that have this whole save the environment cause that is quite common with celebrities now a days so the point he made may or may not be legitimate. That is if he's not one of those hypocritical Hollywood celebrities that is doing more harm than good to the environment which would cause certain incidents like indirectly effecting the bee's. The most inane part of all this is how irrelevant this all is concerning the lawsuit and all its subplots and how bizarre and fictitious they all are. Another problem is Chris Rock who is supposedly playing a prominent role in the film who only winds up appearing in two scenes with very few lines. Even though overall this is an innocent children's movie that shouldn't be taken seriously. It is taken to a critical view point because there are enough critics in the world that find a problem with every film. However this film is no exception as it contains many flaws in comparison to many other films in this genre with how many dry jokes and god-awful subplots are in this film. However on a positive note it doesn't matter what I'm saying as long as it satisfies your family and children as the movie is exclusively aimed to people in that group and no one else.It's a family friendly film that should be left alone without any public criticism or scrutiny no matter how stupid the film is. However that's what our society is like, critical on some of the most innocent films. Overall this film remains entertaining to a certain group of people that being a family audience and that's all I can think of who would be attracted to this movie."
181,Bee Movie,7,10 November 2007,"Bradley Lily Say's it's "" Family Action Packed""","this movie is a great for the family. It Has Good Humor, great storyline, It is a fantastic kids movie.

182,Bee Movie,5,9 November 2007,Stung A Little...,"Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld), a bee fresh out of college, becomes increasingly unsure about a future enveloped wholly in making honey. He embraces a chance to examine life outside the hive and, once he seizes the chance, runs headlong into the shocking discovery that bees are being exploited, en masse, for their full-time honey creation. With help from college buddy Adam Flayman (Matthew Broderick) and human florist Vanessa Bloome (Renee Zellweger), he takes the human race to court in an attempt to win back what belongs to the bees.A fun notion, one someone would expect from Seinfeld in truth, proves not to be quite enough, coming across as rather a children's book splashed with clever celebrity cameos. This is the sort of formula that I had hoped Dreamworks would stray from. The placement of plot points seems somewhat out of order as well, with not quite enough time spent on Vanessa's jealous boyfriend Ken (hilarious Patrick Warburton), and too much time on rushing toward a difficult-to-accept resolution. The film really asks you to entertain many stretches of logic and physics, a few more than the typical animated movie would, while attempting to be cerebral at the same time. That's a tricky order to say the least, and I'm led to think it was a little too much for this particular crew.It's not a total downer, though. The aforementioned cameos are fun and appropriate, and the voice acting is top-notch, with a cast wisely stocked with veterans in the voice-over game. The actual court case is probably the best part of the film. The stunning visuals that come with Barry and company's flights around the city and through traffic are a sight to behold, and design and rendering are nice and tight. Even the honey itself is golden and gorgeous, although you may cut down your intake of it after seeing this one.A fun diversion, it is, but perhaps not worth a first-run viewing."
183,Bee Movie,7,7 November 2007,"Very clever, entertaining for kids and adults","The animated feature genre has been so overdone and the reviews were generally poor for this movie, so I went into this with low expectations. My significant other has young children so I have been subjected to virtually every animated feature released over the last 2 years. This was a refreshing change because Seinfeld did not take the movie or the message too seriously. It is, after all, a cartoon! The movie is peppered with sly humor suggesting a bee existence that parallels the human world. The story is far-fetched as some here have lamented - again folks - it is a CARTOON! If you like Seinfeld's ""observation of human (bee) behavior"" humor, you will enjoy this movie. Like most classic cartoons (i.e. Bugs Bunny) there are multiple references that will go right over your kid's head but will be humorous to you - but the kids won't mind because the basic story is juvenile enough to appeal to them.While this is not on par with Toy Story, I will watch this any day over some of the predictable, repetitious garbage praised elsewhere at this site (""Over the Hedge"" was barely tolerable). Very solid effort."
184,Bee Movie,8,21 March 2008,Bee realistic and you'll Bee entertained!,"This is enjoyable light entertainment without pretense. It has nice characterizations, plenty of humor and typical Seinfeldian insight for those that remain alert. It never takes itself too seriously and - it could be safely assumed - never seeks to have anyone else take it too seriously. It appears that some of the negative comments miss this critical point.Bee Movie has broad appeal for movie-goers with realistic expectations. Accept it for what it is and you won't be disappointed. A survey of this household indicates that diverse audiences including University Professors, Chinese Scientists, Peasant farmers and cute little girls will all enjoy The Bee Movie."
185,Bee Movie,5,11 March 2008,Kinda boring,"Life in the bee hive is highly structured. Bees are born, put into school and upon graduation they can pick a job in the honey-making business. They can then do that job until they keel over and are replaced by other bees. A young bee, fresh out of college, doesn't like this idea at all and flies out of the hive together with the nectar searcher/collectors and gets to see the world outside. He also gets to see honey being sold from human to human and is a witness to more bee-exploitation than he wants to. With this knowledge he is not able to accept his job any more at all and decides to sue humankind for their misbehavior toward bees.So far, the story. The tale is quite fun and rolls well enough through the length of the film. The implications are played out fun enough and believable within the confines of the film. Animation is done very nicely - wild color schemes with fast moving action scenes and life-like faces on bees and humans alike.Still.. It fails. It just moves on too slow and sticks at some places. All taken together there's a few spots where it is fast and fun but too many where it is slow and boring and that makes the end result a negative one. Too slow, too boring.5 out of 10 burned out bees"
186,Bee Movie,10,10 March 2008,Sweet Movie! Totally cool! Welcome Back Jerry Seinfeld!,"This kids movie was totally awesome and had lot's of adult humor. Welcome back Jerry Seinfeld who hasn't really done anything since Seinfeld. Renne Zellewigger was awesome as usual. Tons of big actors. I hate to say Matthew Brodderick grows on me when I see him in good movies. My favourite character was Chris Rock the Mosquito ""I was a blood sucking parasite before... I just needed a briefcase. Animated movies are just mind blowing how smooth the animation is and how realistic. Actors get way more into the voice roles I find. This movie has catchy music and lot's of laughs. Very inventive script. Jerry Seinfeld is a great whiny bee who challenges bee ethics and human nature. This movie is totally cool and I already know I will be buying this on video this week. Sweet..."
187,Bee Movie,7,16 February 2008,Bee-autiful animation enhances an imaginative but overly sophisticated story,"Barry the Bee (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld) has just graduated from a college in the hive. Now it is time for him to decide what job he wants for the rest of his life. As all of the bees work in the production of honey, does Barry want to be a stirrer, like his father, or get a job in transport or clean-up? Or, could he aspire to be a member of the team which goes ""out"" of the hive to gather the ingredients to make the honey, out in the big, big world called New York City? Needing time to think things over, Barry is soon invited to travel with the pollen gatherers. But, in short order, he gets separated from the group and ends up in the residence of a lovely florist named Vanessa (Renee Zellweger). Vanessa saves Barry from elimination, as her visiting, obnoxious boyfriend wants to squash the little bee flat. From that moment on, Vanessa and Barry develop a friendship. Amid numerous problems, such as Barry discovering that some bees are being forced to make honey for the human population, they work together to bring their two species into agreement. Can it last? This is, first, a bee-autiful film to watch. The animation is brimming with color and imagination, creating a world that is a joy to behold. The script, written in part by Seinfeld, is also very clever but a mite sophisticated for the younger set, making the film work better for older kids and their families. All of the actors providing the voices for the characters are great, including Seinfeld, Zellweger, Chris Rock, and, especially, John Goodman. My advice? Make a beeline to the cinema or store to get this film for your children, all you caring fathers and moms. This flick is a feast for the eyes and, indeed, for the heart as well."
188,Bee Movie,3,23 December 2007,"""Well, this sucks""","I was invited to see this movie with my grandparents, my three cousins and aunt then out to dinner at Wendy's. I didn't eat the Wendy's I get a stomach ache just looking at it. Anyway, I didn't know what to do. At ten a.m. the next morning, I was woken up by a phone call, it was my grandpa. I choked out that I would go see it. I saw the previews on TV, they all said ""oh, it's great you'll love it!"" I went because it was my two year old cousin's first time seeing a movie in theatres, I wanted to be polite. I was lucky enough to see a preview to see Enchanted, one of my favourite movies now. That was the best part. I prefer violence in movies like LOTR. Which are my all time favourite movies. (I never read the books though. I get all my info from my cousin) I walked out of the theatre. I had to say I liked it in front of my two year old cousin and my four year old cousin. I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed the Shrek films and Finding Nemo, well, Finding Nemo was worse, much, much worse. I don't like animated films, except the Simpsons movie. As I said earlier, people who like violence and love the Lord of the Rings as their favourite movies, like me, you may not like it like me. Anyway, that's my opinion."
189,Bee Movie,7,20 December 2007,Nothing wrong with some good simple entertainment!,"This is a real pleasant animated movie, that doesn't really stand out, but surely will give you a good time while watching it.Because Jerry Seinfeld is foremost a stand-up comedian, a lot of jokes in this movie are also verbal ones, rather than visual ones. It makes this movie a little different from the usual animated one, of which so many get released these days. Not of course that there are not any visual jokes, there are still also plenty of those and as well some typical cartoonish slapstick like moments.Some plot lines are introduced but they are not wrapped up properly or just abandoned after a while. It makes the movie its story, especially in the second halve, a bit of a disjointed one. As if they were just still chronologically coming up with the story during the animation process. Same goes for some of the characters. As the movie progresses some of them are being introduced as new 'big' characters but then suddenly disappear again out of the story completely without making a relevant enough addition to the movie as a whole.Just like the previous Dreamworks animated movie ""Madagascar"", the movie it's animations aren't among their finest in the field. It's at times a pretty simplistic looking movie, without too much details or complicated shots. It's as if Dreamworks only wants to spend some real money and their expertise on the Shrek-serials.Still pretty amazing how many well known people lend their voice to this movie. Also some people you wouldn't expect it from such as Barry Levinson, Sting, Oprah Winfrey and Ray Liotta in an hilarious cameo as himself. But above all, it of course still is a Jerry Seinfeld movie. Also John Goodman and Patrick Warburton plays some fun parts. My only wish would be that Patrick Warburton's role was just a bit bigger.Not the sort of movie you'll still talk about 10 years from now but I simply had a good time while I was watching it.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
190,Bee Movie,4,28 November 2007,Beebylon,"Bee Movie idea is stolen from the Swedish guys Henrik Wallgren and Per Ulmaeus. Check out www.digital-mysteries.com The guys behind the year 2002 idea called ""Beebylon"" showed it to Dreamworks in order to get some backup finishing the project and this was Dreamworks way of showing appreciation I suppose...I used to like Seinfeld but all this shady business of taking credit of other peoples work makes me think of what he and Mr Spielberg does to other peoples ideas. Seinfeld laughs at the accusations and says that bees often are drawn in yellow and black. Obviously he tries to turn the critique into a distasteful joke.I really hope that the Swedish guys gets some sort of credit for their work. Sad but true."
191,Bee Movie,,24 November 2007,Grade? What Else? B.,"Comedian/former television superstar Jerry Seinfeld's crack at the big-time cinematic ranks via the computer-generated animated route at DreamWorks ends up being an uneven and only slightly impressive venture for all involved. Basically ""A Bug's Life"" without the energy, creativity, or vivid characters, as ""Bee Movie"" starts off strongly enough and then falls into a ""The Verdict""-styled piece with would-be courtroom drama and surprise witnesses as our hero attempts to sue the human race for using bees' honey. It is as weird as it sounds. The long-reaching effects of the court's decision will end up having ramifications which go way beyond New York City and simple beehives. Seinfeld's observations were landmark on his television sitcom about nothing, but here it seems like he is almost out of his element completely. Probably a good idea to go the animated route here because there are issues with the script and character development. If you have to have a genre where you can succeed with those absent, it is the in the animated feature film---where often not everything has to be taken quite as seriously. 4 stars out of 5."
192,Bee Movie,4,16 November 2007,Jerry Seinfeld's Bee Movie is somewhat entertaining and that's it,"Despite reading some dreadful reviews, I decided to take in Bee Movie since I love both animation and Jerry Seinfeld. While the former was mostly impressive, the latter as both leading player and head writer left a lot to be desired. The story-about one worker bee who ventures in the outside world, makes friends with a human from there (Renee Zellweger), and sues for a million dollars-could have been executed perfectly but with Jerry and his former ""Seinfeld"" writing staff being the contributors, all we got was a mishmash of jokes that suited whatever they felt was funny and some punchlines of Famous Celebrities who conveniently seemed available (Ray Liotta, Sting, and Larry King). Nice to also hear voices of Matthew Broderick, Chris Rock, Oprah Winfrey, and former ""Seinfeld"" co-star Patrick Warburton. But this is a very uneven movie that neither succeeds as adult parody or children's classic. Bee Movie is worth a look at least once and that's it."
193,Bee Movie,4,8 November 2007,For the little ones really,"Bee Movie looks pretty but is incredibly low on plot and storyline.Take the idea that a bee whose just graduated (with a very weak joke about the shortness of the bee lifestyle) and is about to choose his job and place in life but decides he's unhappy with his life.But hang on! He HASN'T even GOT a life yet! So how can he be unhappy with it? Nope, he's unhappy at the prospect of his life. So big deal, so are over 90% of the working population! Live with it! So Barry goes out with the fliers, sees the outside would and meets and is saved by a human who he talks to breaking 25 million years of tradition. Hmmm, with all that length of tradition you'd think it'd been done before but just never spoken about again, no? Anyway, his life of leisure finally leads him to discover how humans eat and take honey from bees and he's annoyed and decides to sue. A ridiculous concept, no court on the planet would accept such a case. So the plots derailed there.Of course the bees win (after playing the slavery card) and all farmed bees are freed and all honey is returned to the bees who promptly stop making honey and pollinating.Which destroys the Eco-system (a completely nonsensical notion. wasps, mites & butterflies and the wind also cause pollination) and puts Barry florist friend out of a job as there are no More flowers left apart from a parade.So they crash the parade, steal a float and take the flowers back on the plane. the pilot & co-pilot get incapacitated and Barry and his friend have to land the plane.Another stupid notion that bees could carry a plane (it'd take billions & they'd be blown away even if they ever could fly fast enough to catch a jet in the 1st place).Anyway, the bees re-pollinate and the flowers are saved. End of awful movie with REALLY AWFUL science."
194,Bee Movie,9,9 April 2008,a blast,"i'm' really glad i decided to pick up this movie.i didn't expect much,but i got a lot.this is one entertaining movie.it's funny,fast paced,and touching.it's definitely action packed and exciting.also the humour is such that adults will enjoy it as much as children.the look of the film is also fantastic.i also thought the the voice actors fit their characters perfectly.Chris Rock's mosquito character is very funny,as is Patrick Warburton's human being who hates bees.i think this movie is suitable for the whole family.it's good clean fun.it's 90 minute running time seems a lot less,due to it's fast pace.i highly recommend it.i give Bee movie a 9/10"
195,Bee Movie,1,24 May 2017,Don't watch this with your kids,"I attended this film with my granddaughter and was incredibly disappointed at its vision--and horrified that Seinfeld's ideas would affect my innocent, intelligent, egalitarian-minded granddaughter's thinking. Since when are honey worker bees male--and militant? Since when has the nuclear family existed in bee ""culture""? A coming-of-age story about female bees would have made sense. Seinfeld has blatantly disregarded facts of nature, and has missed an opportunity to appreciate female insect ""culture"" and knowledge. Male coming-of-age stories are still the ones our culture thinks it wants to hear, even, apparently, if these are perversions of natural truth. Children's thinking, already influenced by a culture and world that definitely does not appreciate human women (and things ""female"") anywhere near as much as it privileges human men (and things ""male""), will be further indoctrinated into patriarchal, nuclear family, militarist thinking by this new sort of Disneyfication of nature. Seinfeld's indifference in his rendering of bee life has missed the mark in so many ways."
196,Bee Movie,2,1 May 2017,"Meandering, Unfunny and Pointless - Why Did This Happen?","Jerry Seinfeld plays a litigious bumblebee, out to reclaim honey profits from the humans, in this animated entry from Dreamworks. It's odd that this was so deep into the studio's career (fifteenth in their catalog, just after Shrek the Third) because the CGI is terribly dated, a major handicap. It's often downright difficult to look at (particularly in scenes with human characters) and there's nothing in the plot to make up that slack. No stinger, no sizzle, no emotional hook and shockingly few laughs, considering Seinfeld is one of the co-writers. An early teaser trailer might have tread too close to home in ribbing ""this is what he picks to follow the TV series?"" Watery and hollow, it's a boring story that constantly stretches to cram in weird, vacuous bee and honey references. Like the segment with ""Bee Larry King."" That's literally the entire joke; a bee with big glasses, suspenders, hunched shoulders and a map of lights behind him. Is there another level to this that I'm just not getting? Pointless, helpless and pitiful, it was a struggle to finish."
197,Bee Movie,4,27 April 2017,Can it Bee That This Film is Unimpressive?,"Bee Movie has become an internet meme thanks to Seinfeld, We Are Number One and the '____ But Every Time ______ it ____' videos on YouTube. Now, getting back to the movie: it's pretty pedestrian stuff. Easily DreamWorks Animation's most forgettable movie by far. The only thing going for it is the fact it became an memorable internet meme. Besides that though, there's next to nothing going for the film. Its writing is average, the voice-acting well cast but misused, and the direction is sub-par for such a high-profile animated film of its kind.Bee Movie: great internet entertainment but as a film it's a shell purely made to amuse kids in the meantime."

199,Bee Movie,8,17 January 2017,"Strange, but still great!","Bee Movie is awesome. It has great CGI, great voice cast, a pretty decent story, and many funny moments. This film is perfect for those who have a fascination for bees. Some people who don't might also enjoy it, too. However, this movie can be a little strange. One reason is the fact that it's pretty much about Barry B. Benson, whom is a bee, suing the human race over their honey consumption, which is weird on its own, but what's weirder is that Barry is dating Vanessa Bloome, whom is a human. Uhh, okay?.. But other than that, this film is entertaining and a joy to watch. It may not attract everyone, but I believe it is enough for me to recommend. Though it isn't the best Dreamworks film, it's still good enough to be remembered as a pretty big staple in the list of Dreamworks films"
200,Bee Movie,7,15 January 2017,"Liked it as a 9-year-old, still like it as an 18-year-old","I'm just here to put in my 5 cents; it's really not bad. I enjoyed it thoroughly the first time, and I enjoyed it even more 9 years later. I found myself laughing at a lot of their jokes and replaying certain moments while watching. It's a lot more fast-paced than I remembered, however. The characters were strangely lovable to me, but the thing that really made it stick out was the dialog. It strangely mixed well into the fast-paced plot, and it delivered jokes in a way that got me laughing, not to mention the expressions that went along with them. I know most people look to this movie as bad and as dank memes, but I think of it as a good-natured movie I'd watch again on a sunny day. It's not the best, but I find it just good enough to like its charm."
201,Bee Movie,5,14 August 2016,Boo Movie...,"The idea of a honeybee dating a florist is as ludicrous as a rat using a kitchen worker as a puppet to make his own dishes, but it's all in the treatment. Pixar knew how to handle it by clearly marking the line between humans and rats and making a bridge out of the tender relationship between Rémi and the Linguini, and this is why ""Ratatouille"" won the Oscar for Best Animated Film and was one of the highest-grossing movie of the year and why DreamWorks' movie of the same year, ""Bee Movie"" didn't succeed as well despite its potential. It even had a better pun than 'Ratatouille'.The film opens in a hive that feels like a bee-ish Metropolis, juxtaposing a huge monopolistic corporation in charge of honey productions (what else?) with perhaps the most perfectly functioning society ever seen in film: bees. Imagine a place where everyone's got a job, a house, a social status, and is given what needed to live and work according to his resources or physical abilities, even Marx wouldn't have dreamed of it. But would you call it Utopian? In fact, bees have been buzzing around for about 27 millions years, about 15 times longer than men, so there's a little hope that if we wise up a little and don't end up destroying ourselves in the next Nuclear war, we might have a society like in ""Bee Movie"".So, Bees form a solid community and a perfectly oiled (or honeyed) organization: if someone dies, another one takes his place and the circle of life goes and on without anyone trying to break the cycle. They all live for and by honey, and the process in the making is so complex that everyone finds a proper job, there's no small job. But of course, the main protagonist, named Barry (which is normal for an American bee) is the nonconformist type, the perspective of working his life out on the same job with no day off frightens him, so he needs escapism, or at least, discovering the world before settling out. Which leads him to the only available option: joining the like the elite bees' squad teams in charge of collecting the pollen and pollinating the other flowers. And this is when ""Top Gun"" meets ""A Bug's Life"" in a dazzling animated sequence where Barry escapes from the hive and discovers the real world.Naturally, we expect human beings to be part of the setting and the story since they're the greatest part of the outside world. So it was expectable to have Barry getting lost during the raid. This is how, after being stuck to a tennis ball, he had to go through a car when naturally, you hear the typical wise-ass ""you've got to freeze"", but at that part, I was having my first concerns. Would the film be about a bee being lost? Would he meet other insects then helping him to get back to his hive? ""Finding Barry""? ""A Bee's Life""? No, Barry finds himself in a house, which happens to be the same where the former tennis players live, and there he meets Vanessa, and for some strange reason, the animators decided that bees and humans could talk together. Why, of course, it's a cartoon, why would we accept talking bees living in a futuristic hive and not accept that they would talk with humans? Well, maybe like bees, we forged an instinct on animation watching, and understand that just because you have an imaginary world, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist outside rational standards, there is the world of bees and the world of humans, and there's no reason for these two worlds to interact with the same languages, signs or signals. Of course, I understand that without this plot device, there would be no story. All right, but would we have really missed something out of the platonic relationship with Vanessa, the court trial against humans for stealing honey (a waste of John Goodman's voice) and the random plane climax? The most disappointing ideas came from the fact that the bees could talk with humans, they could interact in any way, not that one.I had the greatest expectations when I saw Barry flying with the jocks to conquer some flowers but I couldn't believe ten minutes later, I'd see him sharing a coffee with a florist or going on trial... by computer animation program' standards, it's boring. It's certainly intelligent, written by wisecracking SNL alumni New Yorker Jerry Seinfeld yadda yadda yadda but how about the screen intelligence? the faculty to understand that just because something sounds funny on the paper, it won't provoke the same hilarity in a theater. How about making something adult but allowing the children to enjoy the film? ""Shrek"" could, even ""Shark Tale"" did, but from the way they treated Winnie the Pooh, it's obvious children weren't the prime target, well, so much for the Box Office Top 10.In the end, Bee Movie is never as fun as when you see Barry acting like a bee and never as painful to watch as when he acts like a human.I'm sure the writers could pull off something more exciting, that mosquito voiced by Chris Rock stole the show in less than one minute and should have been part of the team, but what we got instead, Barry's intellectual and no-nonsense buddy, playing the lawyer and voiced by Matthew Broderick ugh. I'm surprised the movie didn't include an argument with Vanessa or a jail sequence, just the obligatory pun jokes and more-or-less inspired references to existing people (Sting, good, Larry King: déjà vu) and guest celebrity voices that steal their characters' thunder, but that's not saying much.In French, to say ""what's got into them?"" , you say what fly stung them? It seems appropriate to end this review by paraphrasing this expression and ask which twisted bee had stung the animators?,"
202,Bee Movie,8,4 August 2016,Very underrated...,"Okay so lets talk about this movie.I will talk about the story,the animation and the characters.Lets begin: THE STORY:8/10.The story is very creative and cool,but i did not like that there were a lot of things going on and it was kinda hard to follow at some points. THE ANIMATION:7/10.When the movie begins you will probably see that the animation quality is kinda bad even for 2007 because of the human designs and even the bees design does not look very cool ass you expected,but there are some good things that we got out from the animation.1.the backgrounds are beautiful 2.the flying scenes are very cool and 3.the idea of the honey production is very very creative and very well animated too. THE CHARACTERS:8/10. The thing i like the most about this movie are the characters because i really love Vanessa's character and i like Barry too.There are some characters that i do not care about like:Ken,Montgomery,Moose blood and others because they are not very important to me. Overall this movie is okay and i think anyone can like it in some way. TOTAL:8/10"
203,Bee Movie,5,18 July 2016,"Even for a kids movie, it's a train-wreck","I firmly believe that kids movies don't necessarily have to make sense or be realistic to be good, but I also believe that there's a very thin line that you have to base your writing on just so the movie isn't a bunch of random, unrelated occurrences. This line is called common sense. I don't want to bore you with a wall of text so I'll just list what bothered me the most: 1. When Barry (the bee protagonist) talks, Vanessa (the human co-protagonist) has a completely believable shock reaction - soon afterwards, other humans (and in great quantity) hear the bees talking and aren't shocked at all 2. We see Barry getting into a car by accident and the family inside is panicked, but soon afterwards, an entire court is filled with bees and nobody bats an eye 3. Barry wants to sue the human race for stealing honey from bees. This story ark is all developed in NYC, but for some reason it affects flowers and bees from the ENTIRE world, despite 90% of the movie developing in NYC. According to this movie, the world is one small place where NYC and California are the only places in the world 4. It's full of American culture references, so many of the jokes will fall flat unless you're American 5. Bees have an unbreakable ""don't talk to humans"" code. Barry breaks it and without blinking an eye, every single bee in the hive breaks it as well just because of the honey 6. You can learn how to fly a plane in minutes with a couple of instructions from a bee And now for the blatant scientific inaccuracies that will bother us adults: - Bees are able to seamlessly fly at extremely high heights - A ton of dying flowers will come back to life in less than a second with just a pinch of pollen I could go on but I think you get the point. I like when movies are crazy and fantastic, but Bee felt like a train-wreck with a dash of potential. Wouldn't recommend it."
204,Bee Movie,5,27 December 2015,Bee a Good Movie.,"Bee Movie (2007): Dir: Steve Hickner, Simon J. Smith / Voices: Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, Patrick Warburton, Chris Rock: Title pokes fun of the term ""B movie"" while providing a simplistic and predictable animation about adventure and the life of a bee. Jerry Seinfeld voices Barry B who graduates to become a working class bee for the hive. He longs to venture outside the hive with the pollen jocks and once he does he embarks on a lawsuit where bees demand ownership of their honey. Some clever themes but story is thin. Directors Steve Hickner and Simon J. Smith have fun with the lawsuit aspect of the story where mankind possesses ownership of animal production. Seinfeld voices Barry who anticipates adventure but discovers danger along with friendship. Renee Zellweger is wonderful voicing an understanding florist who embarks upon this lawsuit in support of the bees. Other characters are not quite as interesting. Matthew Broderick is given the thankless task of voicing Barry's friend Adam who prefers hive life. Patrick Warburton voices the florist's boyfriend Ken in a variation of his other animated roles. Chris Rock voices a mosquito who joins the buzz fest despite the fact that the human race hates mosquitoes. Interesting theme regarding talents combine with glorious animated images keep the stinger sharp, while a lackluster screenplay dulls it. Score: 5 / 10"

206,Bee Movie,5,19 October 2014,I don't know what it's trying to spoof but it's trying to spoof something.,"Bee Movie is one of those films that you know is trying to spoof something. Seeing as how it's been a long time since I've seen it, I don't remember everything, but I know that if Jerry Sienfield plays the protagonist, and Larry King, Ray Liotta, Sting, and Carl Kasell are doing cameos, you know it's obviously trying to satirize something. Well let's look at the plot. Barry B Benson (Sienfield) is a bee who just graduated from bee college in a bee hive. He one day inadvertently goes into our world and meets a human woman named Vanessa Bloom (Renee Zellweger) and starts this strange bee-human friendship. Everything is going fine until Barry finds out that humans eat honey and decides to sue them. The problems with this movie seem pretty obvious. The story seems to go every which way and it's easy to get lost if you're not paying attention. The other problem is that the dialog consists mostly of jokes, references, and puns. Even the protagonist's name is a pun. Even the title is a pun. And on top of that with the cameos that I mentioned above it's easy to see that this is just trying to spoof popular culture. So in other words I don't really recommend it a whole lot."
207,Bee Movie,6,24 August 2014,Jerry Seinfeld as a bee is a cute idea but not funny,"Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) is a bee who just graduated from college. He is dismayed that he has to pick one job for the rest of his life without a day off. Instead of working in the hive, he joins the pollen jockeys who fly outside. Talking to humans is strictly forbidden but that's exactly what Barry does when florist Vanessa Bloome (Renée Zellweger) saves his life. He can't settle on a job for 3 whole days. He is shocked to find that humans are stealing honey from bees. So he decides to sue the human race. Then nature is destroyed in an apocalypse. How fun!Jerry Seinfeld is being Jerry Seinfeld except he's a bee. Talking to humans diminishes the magic of the bee world. It's not that the bee world is that magical or fascinating. It's bright and yellow. But it's very workaday. The marrying of bee world with references to the real world is cute for a little while but it gets tiresome. Then the whole trial thing gets to be just stupid and not actually funny. It's an OK movie that is essentially a 90 minute take of a Seinfeld standup of what if he's a bee."
208,Bee Movie,8,16 July 2014,What's the deal with honey? Jerry & Renee make a sweet animated couple,"BEE MOVIE (2007) *** (Voices of: Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, Patrick Warburton, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Kathy Bates, Barry Levinson, Larry King, Oprah Winfrey, Larry Miller, Megan Mullally, Rip Torn, Michael Richards, Mario Joyner, Jim Cummings, Tom Papa, Carol Leifer, Jeff Altman, David Herman; as themselves: Sting & Ray Liotta) Funny animated fluff about a honey bee named Barry B. Benson (voiced winningly by Seinfeld  who co-scripted - and mined from his comic sensibilities) who wonders if his life has more meaning by thinking  literally  outside the hive when he decides to check out the big world and its human inhabitants, namely a lovely florist (Zellweger doing a lovely bit of acting too), and discovers that their precious honey is being exploited. While the paper-thin premise and punny sense of humor with a few knowing pop culture riffing is the standard, the film is a wonderful explosion of cinematic eye candy thanks to the animating team @ DreamWorks and the fluid direction by Steve Hickner and Simon J. Smith make up for the hit-and-miss production."
209,Bee Movie,5,4 January 2014,B Movie is an apt title.,"I'm not sure why it is that I feel the impulsive need to leave a review that no one will ever read on a 6 year old animated movie... unfortunately when I see a 747 piloted by bees I can't help but feel the need to rant and rave a little.It was obvious what was going to happen pretty quickly in this scene and I'm afraid 'It's just a cartoon!' can only go so far as an explanation. Throughout the film there was a tendency to aim the plot and script towards adults. It had some serious plot lines with obvious metaphorical links to real world human society. Choosing one job straight out of school and then having to stick with it is a problem a lot of people face and something which resonates well. Feeling lost amongst a crowd and unimportant and etc etc...It had the same kind of cold, depressing vibe which Antz did compared to A Bug's Life. Therefore it felt far more aimed at an older audience to me. The first half of the film seemed to be fairly strongly written with a sensible backbone offset by physical comedy and not bad writing.So why exactly did they feel the need to have a million bees piloting an airliner? The film started on the notion that science says bees shouldn't be able to fly (although how they do has since been discovered using high speed photography) but I didn't get the impression we were supposed to suspend disbelief based on this statement. We weren't meant to believe them to be magic. The film says that bees should not fly in rain and to avoid this that and the other...Yet bees are apparently capable of flying to 30,000 foot without freezing or asphyxiating or just plain running out of energy on the journey up there? The journey up there which supposedly took about thirty seconds? Assuming a bee could actually reach that kind of altitude without adverse side effects and assuming they could reach their top speed of 15-20mph vertically then the ascent would still take twenty minutes... by which point the plane would have crashed.Honestly that is just insanely petty nitpicking though. I'd be willing to stake a rather large sum of money that the surface area of an airliner is not capable of hosting enough bees to bear the weight of the thing. The power to weight ratio of a bee may be high and they might be able to carry a lot of weight for their size (googling figures on such things is fairly fruitless)... but I doubt if there would be enough bees in the country to move such an aircraft. Again nitpicking.I guess my two main complaints lie in the fact that a bee cannot travel at five hundred bloody miles per hour and hence physically could not latch onto the aircraft. Also when they do fly it the main bee protagonist's impossible love interest is still somehow controlling the direction of the aircraft using the sticks even though the bees are the ones flying it.The bees suing the human race side of the story felt pretty stupid to me even though the actual set up to it - the bee work camps, was good. The world dying was fairly pretentious and preposterous too. Plants do not die if they are not pollinated... rather the next generation just does not come to replace them. Rose pollen cannot cross pollinate every species on the planet and there are pollinators besides bees. Some flowers have intimate relationships with specific species of insect or bird and some still use wind distribution. Bees not pollinating would have a large effect but not to this end. The real world issue of bee colonies collapsing is a serious point and they could have tackled it... but they just went for the stupid option instead. Still all that served some kind of purpose in the film and did echo some real world points... loosely.The plane bit though... it just felt like they wanted some huge closing dramatic scene to make people forget that half the film was spent in a court room. All in all a film of two halves - one which is reasonably good and one which is just ridiculous and serves only to make the whole worse.B Movie is an apt title."
210,Bee Movie,8,7 June 2013,Not a bad jump to animation at all,"Bee Movie was Jerry Seinfeld's first foray into comedy and it was met with disappointment. I might be in the minority but I don't think it was such a bad start for Seinfeld's foray into animation. The bee-on-human sexual undertones made me a little uncomfortable, but I thought the jokes were sharp with as was the overall comic plot. It hearkened to the days of Pixar's first films like Monster's Inc. and Toy Story that were permeated by an adventurous attitude of fully exploring the comic possibilities of a familiar-yet-foreign world. The film also had that double layer of comedy all successful animated films need where kids laugh but adults pick up on extra jokes and laugh more. Rene Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, Ray Liotta, and even Oprah Winfrey are game here as they venture into Seinfeld's universe."
211,Bee Movie,6,14 May 2012,"Not exactly a masterpiece to me, but a decent enough film nonetheless","When I was 13 years old at the time, other films like ""The Simpsons Movie"", ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", and ""Transformers"" were released at the time and became box office hits. Then, at in late of 2007, I stumbled upon this film in theaters after it reminded me of the trailers that I saw and thought, ""Hey, this might not be a bad movie after all."" Then, I went inside the theater and watched the whole thing all the way through, thinking that whether or not it would be a really good family animated film.However, in my opinion, I think that this is a decent animated feature from Dreamworks Animation (after their atrocious disappointment ""Shark Tale""). Not great, but good. So, what do I like about it? Well, let's just say that there are some really good stuff. The animation on the whole is brilliant with some realistic character movements, the perfect detail of the honey, the visual look of the city and the hive and some very decent character animation. The soundtrack from Rupert Gregson Williams was pretty good, if not over-dramatic at times.The characters weren't exactly my favorites, but were actually pretty decent. Barry B. Benson wasn't that bad since he was determined to do what's right for his people at the hive. Vanessa, a florist who understands that a bee can talk, is pretty good as the second main character. The other bees including Barry's parents and Adam were pretty decent. The human characters are kind of a mixed bag. Dr. Montgomery wasn't my favorite human character, but at least he was a bit entertaining. Ken is sometimes funny, but can sometimes be childish and annoying.What do I hate about this movie? Well, there's bit few negatives to go around. The story had a decent enough premise (a bee trying to restore all of the honey back to the hive) in the first half, but the second half was too obvious was made me felt like I went to a totally different animated movie. There are some moments that were quite forced and rushed (including the court scene) and some drug moments (with the adults smoking) that would disturb younger kids. Some of the jokes are decent, but some of them feel flat and lacked some wit and depth to it.Overall, Bee Movie isn't a masterpiece to me, but like I said, it's pretty decent. It has some great animation, some smart and clever Dialogue, and excellent voice work from Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, and Patrick Warburton, but with a much better compelling story, much better pacing, and much better characters (still, the characters here are still decent), this would have been so much better. I'm sure kids will like, but for others, I'd stick to Kung Fu Panda and How To Train Your Dragon.Rating: 6.3/10"
212,Bee Movie,7,8 May 2012,Decent animation from Dreamworks,"Reviews I'd read of this film suggested it was average at best but I thought I'd watch it anyway and while it is hardly a classic I'm glad that I watched it as it had a decent number of laughs and an entertaining if fairly light story. The film follows the life of Barry B. Benson, a newly qualified honey bee who is getting ready to pick the job he will do for the rest of his life. He is destined to work making honey in the hive but after a run in with the 'pollen jocks' he joins them for a flight out of the hive. When he gets caught in the rain he takes shelter in an apartment; here he is almost squashed by a man wielding a boot but Vanessa, the man's girlfriend, saves him. Being polite he decides to thank her even though talking to humans is against B law. After her initial shock the two of them become friends while his parents start to worry about why he hasn't decided on what job to do in the hive. One day he learns that people eat honey; he follows a supply lorry back to the farm and is horrified to see rows of hives where bees slave away to make honey that people take. Deciding to make a stand he takes humanity to caught; demanding that they stop taking honey and return what they have taken already. Inevitably he wins but there are consequences he didn't anticipate; without the need to make honey the bees stop pollinating flowers and soon they all start to die something that will put florist Vanessa out of work and ultimately endanger much of the life on Earth! This film was quite a bit better than I expected despite some obvious flaws and many jokes that will go right over the heads of younger viewers. I don't think the creators had much interest in making the bees anything like real bees; I can understand some changes such as giving them more human faces after all they are talking animated bees not real ones, however I'm not sure why they don't have six legs as that is both anatomically correct and could provide some humour! The characters were entertaining enough although it was very much a one man I mean one bee show; Barry is clearly the star of the film and unfortunately he wasn't that funny; he seemed to play the straight man while those he interacted with provided the jokes. The voice actors performed well however I could have done without the celebrities who appeared as themselves; they were all people who would probably not be recognised by younger viewers and the jokes required you to know who they were. I was impressed with most of the animation; the flying scenes look particularly good; giving the viewer the sensation of flying along side the bees. Overall it was better than I expected and worth watching if it is on television."
213,Bee Movie,6,13 March 2012,Enjoyable.....,"This is a silly movie. It's goal is to make you laugh, and little beyond that. Indeed I laughed for most of the movie. It is hard for me to find much fault when I am laughing that much. That the last act had fewer jokes was a minor misstep. The characters were cute and the story didn't get in the way of the humor. And I kind of enjoyed the story, it was a little odd and funny.It is unusual among animated movies in that its focus is jokes, kind of like a stand-up act. There are a lot of these jokes and they are quite funny! Does anything feel better than laughing? (OK, well very few things.) The story is mainly there as a vehicle for the jokes. So perhaps slightly different expectations will serve you well with this movie.Don't go to this for a serious story! It is light humor, and at that game a great success. If you recognize that that is what the filmmakers are going for, then you will enjoy it. If you are expecting an incredible story or thrilling action or amazing animated beauty, then you might be disappointed.As lighthearted humor with playful animation, and a great ending song, the film is a success."
214,Bee Movie,7,16 March 2011,It's Cute!,"This film is a lot better than I thought it'd be. It's cute. I trust Jerry Seinfeld. He knows how to create laughs. It's got a lot of suggestive humor in it, but a lot of it is relatively funny -- even just the kid-type jokes.I think Patrick Warburton steals the movie from Jerry. Although, Barry is a great character, Patrick plays Ken with just great delivery and timing. Patrick is one of my all time favourite actors and I remember him on Seinfeld as Elaine's on-and-off again boyfriend. He was funny in that show, he was funny in every thing I have seen from him. Even in Scream 3, he got me to laugh.Jerry's script is not just full of laughs, though. It's full of a good storyline and a good amount of romance too. I know, it's about bees. Well, be prepared for the love to appear in the movie. I think the great amount of big names is great. I especially liked the fact that two comedians (Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld) were in this movie. I think I'd prefer watching one movie each 5-10 years from Jerry written by him, than a movie unwritten by him every year. He's just more knowing of how to please an audience when it comes to comedy.It's a cute movie for kids and it's quite satisfying for adults too. I'm 22 and I saw this and I loved it. I mean, it's not the greatest movie but it's fun. That's what it's supposed to be. It can give you a few laughs, serious laugh out loud moments, awwstruck moments and it will give you a good time, overall. It's a great movie, I think."
215,Bee Movie,7,8 January 2011,Bee Movie,"It had been almost a decade since the competing Antz and A Bug's Life were released, and there haven't been many insect based films that have been a hit, especially not computer animated, but then came this one. Basically in a bee hive in Sheep's Meadow, Central Park, New York City, ordinary bee Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld, also writing and producing) has just graduated with his friend Adam Flayman (Matthew Broderick) from college, and they are ready to enter the honey making industry, Honex. They find out however that whatever job they choose will be the job will be working in for the rest of their lives, and Barry doesn't like the sound of that, so he plans to leave the hive, and he does this by pretending to be part of the pollen collecting team who get to go outside. He enjoys his newfound freedom, but he has to find shade when it starts raining, he rests on the apartment windowsill of female florist human Vanessa Bloome (Renée Zellweger), and he breaks the biggest bee rule of talking to her. They spend a lot of time together, but one day while shopping for groceries Barry spots hundreds of jars on honey, humans have been stealing it for centuries. He spots the Honey Farms company truck, and joins mosquito Mooseblood (Chris Rock) on the windscreen going to the place where humans make the honey, artificially, and he decides that this is a case that needs to be taken to court for a lawsuit. With the help of Vanessa proving that he and all bees can talk, and bee and honey related celebrities Sting and Ray Liotta questioned, they win the case, meaning all honey in the world is confiscated. Defence lawyer Layton T. Montgomery (John Goodman) has a point however when he says that they will disrupt nature's balance as honey has been made for over 27 million years, so all bees are out of a job, and all the flowers needing pollen will die out. In the end, Barry and Vanessa realise the big error made to the world, so honey making by bees is restored, the law is dropped, and they change ""Vanessa's Flowers"" to ""Vanessa and Barry: Flowers; Honey; Legal Advice"". Also starring Patrick Warburton as Ken, Megan Mullally as Trudy, Kathy Bates as Janet Benson, Rip Torn as Lou Lo Duca, Rain Man director Barry Levinson as Martin Benson, Larry King as Bee Larry King, Oprah Winfrey as Judge Bumbleton and The Nutty Professor's Larry Miller as Buzzwell. The voice casting is very good, the animation from the same studio as Shrek is of course perfect, the obviously honey and bee jokes are very funny, there just aren't any complaints to be made, a great fun computer animated comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Very good!"
216,Bee Movie,5,5 October 2010,I've Tasted Better Honey,"Plot: A male Bee that is bored with the over the top organized life he lives, flies out of his hive, realizes that honey has become a product by Humans and decides to sue humanity!You'll love Bee Movie if: You want an easy-going, clever animated movie. Bee Movie isn't your typical good VS evil animated movie, even the things that threaten our little insectoid hero are portrayed in such a way that are more cute than evil. Violence, sadness and other bad things are kept to a minimum since most of the movie is filled with harmless and funny situations. The humor involved isn't your typical kiddy humor either, but it is more subtle and clever. Finally while its not the most beautiful animated movie it looks quite good, (I loved the facial animation of the female lead).You'll hate Bee Movie if: You want something less politically correct or you are a kid! The humor of the movie is the main reason why some like this movie and why some don't. The movie is full of clever wordplay, funny quotes and subtle parody than extremely crazy gags, slapstick humor, or insanely hilarious characters The problem is that even if you do like the humor of the film Bee Movie lacks character. The characters are pretty flat your typical heroic protagonist and caring\cute female lead and the jealous cretin as the comic relief. Also some people may not like the futuristic portrayal of the bees' hive, with cars, hi-tech machinery and stuff like that.FINAL VERDICT: A Bit Dry (5.5/10)[+] Funny & easy going. No violence\sadness etc. Looks quite good.[-] Too politically correct. Its humor may not appeal to everyone. Forgettable characters.Also Check: A Bugs Life (1998)  Antz (1998)  Toy Story (1995)  Monsters Inc. (2001)P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say ""I like\don't like this movie"" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO..."
217,Bee Movie,,9 July 2010,Colorful Ridiculousness !,"Did I have a nice time ? Yes. But did I feel ""how silly"" many times ? Well, yes too ! A bee that learns the fact of life while discovering its own. Good. However, there is foolishness everywhere. The whole movie is built on a kind of idiot idea, where the leniency is extremely given from the sane people all the time in the movie (and out of it !) to a degree pushes you to think : Come' on ! It gets real silly with the forced climax. The plane's situation is flashy but can't be taken seriously or lightly either. I believe they aimed for the kids only this time. The very ""little"" ones! And as for the way how all the matters got solved at the finale; it is one of the most naive endings in the history of cinema !The stars are so many yet for no good reason. You can sense plainly that what DreamWorks can't reach by cleverness, to catch up with Pixar, it compensates by the presence of a long list of famous people. At the first trailer of it, (Jerry Seinfeld) was trying hard to make it as a live action movie, so Steven Spielberg asked him ""Why don't you just make it a cartoon?"". In fact, it's obvious that it isn't a cartoon. It's rather a cartoonish 3D.Although the level of the 3D is cool, but it ain't Pixar. Don't wait for details because they aren't fascinating. The visual characterization of (Vanessa Bloome)'s character is the lowest bottom this movie could hit. While (Renée Zellweger) is non-stop festive season, the design was the shooting star on it! I didn't like the main character's form too. It's a case where the evaluation would go like this, the script : funny, the characters' look : dummy !On the other hand, I loved it. The dialog is all along pleasant, even laughable at times (can't forget the mosquito/lawyer's line!). The image is delightful. Maybe my mind wasn't satisfied, but sure it was amused. It seemed like a very lighthearted feel-good comedy from the 1960s meeting the sarcastic showy nature of a Simpson episode. And the outcome of that must be lovely at worst. (Jerry Seinfeld) IS entertaining, I don't know why this guy that lazy?! Why he doesn't make more movies? In any case, he can be interesting. Eventually I'll till you; unlike many Pixar movies, I'll watch (Bee Movie) again. This is the best thing can be said about it, and the highest result it achieves as well.Not a great art. Just good entertainment."
218,Bee Movie,6,4 November 2009,About what I expected,"I distinctly remember my negative reaction to the trailers. This was never something I was that interested in watching, however, a friend of mine lent it to me, so I gave it a shot. I usually don't go for fully-animated films, especially these 3D ones, and this helps confirm my reasoning for that stance; too much focus is put upon the visuals, and the audience does so much ""ooh"" and ""ahh""-ing that they forget the actual quality. Now, it's been a while since I last watched his show, though I don't recall Seinfeld(also, about him, he should not yell again... or talk in a ""ghetto"" fashion... or make another full-length movie, at least without practice or something) spelling out his punchlines like this, nor using so many cringe-inducing, physically painful puns. I can't see anyone other than children laughing at this, and that does not have to be true for a family flick. You'd be hard pressed to find more than a handful of actually good jokes in this. That's a big failure for a comedy, and if the plot was compelling and the moral excellent. I wish I could claim that it was so, in either case. The story is weird, and the concept continually contradicts itself, and simply does not hold up. Also, this seems like it's speaking to those who feel like their job is small, repetitive and meaningless, and merely trying to keep them docile? And for that, they screw around with how nature actually works? For *this*? Design is OK, very bright, cheery and colorful. The acting is intentionally overdone. There is little that censors would find offensive in this. The DVD holds featurettes, a reasonably entertaining and informative commentary track with Jerry and crew, a Dreamworks video jukebox, trailers and a music video. I recommend this to those into these kind of pictures. 6/10"
219,Bee Movie,8,1 August 2009,I want more Seinfeld! Now!,"Ever since Seinfeld ended, Jerry Seinfeld never starred in anything. Besides his stand up ""I'm telling you for the last time"". It took nine years after Seinfeld's end for him to come up with new material. I hate to say it, I know you'll disagree, it doesn't disappoint. Bee movie is the story of Barry B. Benson(Jerry Seinfeld, they could've named him Jerry but it wouldn't keep the B pun going), a bee who's just graduated from the b school. The best grade was a B. When he learns that in the hive, he'll be worked to death, he leaves the hive and goes out into the real world. While there, he is almost killed by Ken(Patrick Warburton from Seinfeld). Until Vanessa Blume(Renee Zellweger) saves his life. Him and Vanessa get very close. Vanessa is actually a florist. When Barry finds out that people are taking their honey and putting it up for sale, he decides to do something. Something that will shock the world and destroy the world. THe plot seems unfeasible. But Bee Movie is funny, fun, and the b pun doesn't disappoint. There are tons of voice talents in this film including Chris Rock as a mosquito, who makes a funny joke about lawyers in the end of the film. The world needs humor like Jerry Seinfeld's and I hope he comes back soon."
220,Bee Movie,,7 June 2009,"Only caters to ""Sienfeld"" audience","In terms of like-for-likes it seems ""Bee movie"" was perhaps Dreamworks intended answer to ""Finding Nemo"". Parallels can be drawn with the extensive research, rich usage of colours and execution of the motion sequences. Sadly, while former relied on simplicity the latter comes with excess baggage of stardom and the sight of the plot is lost. Fans acquainted with Sienfeld would love it but I am afraid the same cannot be said to whom the name fails to ring a bell.With motion picture hardly contributing to her income/ career, Renée seems to be finding solace in animated ventures. Her animated character, Vanessa deserves a special mention. The other ""famous"" characters seem a very bad parody of the actual actors themselves. The plot seems long winded with sub-plots far and between. The clarity of intent is sadly missing and while the finale attempts to tie-in the loose ends, the bee has already hit the iceberg.Finally, the young audience which supposedly animation movies predominantly caters to - sadly, their viewpoint is ignored big time. Except for the bees-and-flowers, there is hardly anything appealing and enhancement to their learning curve."
221,Bee Movie,8,2 June 2009,Fun for the whole family.,"Everyone knows who Jerry Seinfeld is.He is the comical person who was mostly famous for his show 'Seinfeld.'Although I don't watch the show,I did see his movie,and I loved it.What's not to like about 'Bee Movie?'It's sweet,charming,funny,and for an animated film,it's absolutely brilliant.Well,maybe not brilliant,but it's smart and entertaining enough to please kids as much as teens,parents,and grandparents.There's also a really good cast.The movie consists of Jerry Seinfeld,Renne Zellwegger,Matthew Broderick,John Goodman,Patrick Warburton,Chris Rock,Larry King,Ray Liota,Rip Torn,and even Oprah Winfery.Jerry Seinfeld plays Barry Benson,a bee who goes out of his bee hive and into the real world.Soon enough,he meets a woman named Vanessa Bloome(Renee Zellweeger).Then they become friends,how original.One day,he discovers that humans have been stealing honey from the bees and he plans to sue the human race.Pretty good plot,for an animated movie.Anyway,this is a fun and funny movie that the whole family will love.Trust me,it's 91 minutes that you'll never regret."
222,Bee Movie,,3 April 2009,When Bees And Humans Collaborate,"Hickner and Smith come up with a bee adventure written by Seinfeld, Ferestein, Marder and Robin. 'Bee Movie' is a colourful, feel good fun movie. The whole inner world of bees and flowers are very refreshing to watch. They are stunning to look at.With the combined comedic talents of names like Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, Chris Rock, John Goodman, Megan Mulally, Patrick Warburton and Rip Torn, one is bound to have plenty of dozes of laugh out loud moments. It's ironic as the other day I was watching 'Election' where Matthew Broderick's character gets stung by a bee and here he's playing one.The only thing is that there have been too many similar stories that have already been told in the not-so-distant past. Names like 'Ant Bully', 'Shark Tale', 'Antz' and even 'Happy Feet' pop up in mind. Yet, 'Bee Movie' isn't without its charm and has loads of energy and hilarious sequences to keep one entertained. So the story's no original concept but how many films are? And if there's enough of a time gap between watching 'Bee Movie' and those names I mentioned then one can have a good time. In an odd way, after the end credits have closed, I felt like tasting some honey and thanking the bees (I'm among the minority, I suppose, who's not afraid of bees)."
223,Bee Movie,6,14 March 2009,"Enjoyable, but that is all.","The latest of DreamWorks' wild computer-generated films is an interesting and insightful fun ride. It is another lighthearted comedy that explores a small and rather disliked species' way of life and their perspective on the narrow-minded human lifestyle.The big-thinking dreamer Barry Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld) receives a sarcastic invitation to leave the bee hive and explore the outer world, which he grasps instantly. While exploring a dangerous tennis match, a non-bug-friendly car and a crazed human bee-killer lead to him meeting a kind and caring florist (voiced by Renee Zellweger.) Eventually love, friendship, greed, injustice and fury causes him to sue the human race and gain every single drop of honey in existence. That was a terrible mistake as it resulted in an unimaginably colossal environmental problem that he must act quickly to solve...This is no award winning classic but it's well worth taking a look at."
224,Bee Movie,7,4 January 2009,Good movie. Do watch it.,"This animated movie from Dreamworks is visually stunning and at the same time hilarious. The graphics of the movie are really top notch and path breaking. The imagination of the bee life is really cool. Imagine a bee having bath, applying some hair gel, deodorant and eating breakfast all of which is nothing but honey.The movie is about a bee (Barry) who has just graduated! Yes graduated and will now be doing some work at the honey comb. But he just can't decide what work to do. So he ventures out of the honey comb and make friends with a human. One day he finds out that humans like honey and they trap a lot of bee to make it. Now he decides to sue the human race for illegally taking the honey made by bees. This single point could be the most hilarious point in the history of movies. Surely no prizes for guessing who wins the case, it's a ""BEE MOVIE"".One should give a pat on the back to the writers and the screen players of the movies for writing such a hilarious movie and a beautiful movie. Even the quality of the animation is great. Don't forget to watch the fun with the Dreamworks logo at the start of the movie.http://moviesopinion.blogspot.com/"
225,Bee Movie,7,16 November 2008,Intre-sting-ly different,"Plot- I mean looking at a title of a movie, one thinks you know another bug movie with a kiddish story and a happy ending. But, this movie came as a surprise, with its plot as bees of the world suing the human race, for stealing their honey.Characters- All were great especially Renee Zellweger as Vanessa and Chris Rock as Mooseblood.Lookwise- It was well, more yellow and black, but I like the way they thought about the interior of the hive, where they are producing and processing and all that honey in big machines.Overall feeling- I love honey but this movie makes me think should I really consume honey that bees work so hard to produce. Like the movie chicken run makes one feel when one eats chicken, you know to think not to consume chicken. Conclusion- All in all, a must watch, a light watch, a watch for children and adult."
226,Bee Movie,7,28 June 2008,A movie about nothing (except honey),"So we hired ""Bee Movie"" Friday night (and it wasn't for Isaac). It seems to be getting harder and harder to find a movie these days that both wifey and i will like, so I went for an animation movie aimed at small children. The movie probably wouldn't have gotten a look in if not for Jerry Seinfeld's involvement as writer, producer and main character (well his voice at least).""Bee Movie"" is about Barry Benson (Seinfeld), a bee who's ready to join the workforce but is questioning the whole mundane bee existence. He wanders out the hive one day for a look into the real world and is amazed at all the new things, most notably humans and especially Vanessa Bloom (Zelwegger, who is still annoying even as a ""voice""), whom he forms some sort of weird crush. Barry is blown away when he discovers humans eat honey and are making millions out of it, so he decides to sue humans and get the honey back to the bees. This forms an environmental catastrophe and Barry has to decide what he'll do.Pretty good for what it is, with a few decent jokes in there and some great action sequences. Seinfeld is pretty good as Barry, but every time he talked I had Jerry's face in my head, which was a bit weird. Kids should like it, although some of the storyline and humour is probably a bit above most pre-teens."
227,Bee Movie,6,12 June 2008,Some Very Funny Moments but Comes Off a Little Awkward,"Barry B. Benson, a bee who has just graduated from college, is disillusioned at his lone career choice: making honey. On a special trip outside the hive, Barry's life is saved by Vanessa, a florist in New York City. As their relationship blossoms, he discovers humans actually eat honey, and subsequently decides to sue us.There's a certain aspect about this film that would make people happy: It's the lively colors with popping eye candy throughout the film! There's even this 5 minutes action sequence where we see the point of view of the bees and the large world around them! Well, it's done before in many other animated movies but none like this.However, the plot is a bit, well, ridiculous and it's not just one of those plots we can ""go along for the ride."" In the one hour mark, the movie has a different tone and view and I like the idea because it raises questions what we are doing to the bees because it's actually happening in our world right now.What I like in this movie are some risky and sometimes flat out hilarious jokes. I'm sure this movie would fair better with the kids than the adults. I found it tolerable and it's a decent film with some funny jokes but the story is just outlandish and awkward, but who knows, it's an animated movie, right?"
228,Bee Movie,,19 April 2008,"Jerry Seinfeld animated movie, and entertaining story about nothing.","Jerry Seinfeld had a long-running series about ""nothing"", just funny situations. This animated movie is much like that. It requires you to accept that bees can think and talk, just like we humans, but in a smaller voice. My wife and I saw it on DVD and it is a very entertaining 85 minutes. And it does have a subtle message, that when you change something, it can likely have a far-reaching effect that you can't anticipate.Seinfeld is the voice of Barry B. Benson, the bee that just finished his training in the big, highly-automated honey factory, and has to choose his job. ""For the rest of my life"" surprises him, so he does something daring, he joins the bees who fly out each day to gather nectar.Barry does well, but he encounters some unexpected difficulties, including rain. Bees can't fly in the rain. So he ends up in the NY apartment of Renée Zellweger voicing Vanessa Bloome. She protects him from being swatted, and they become friends of sorts. Barry makes a big decision, against all bee rules, he spoke to a human!! The cast is full of experienced actors, including Matthew Broderick, Patrick Warburton, John Goodman (my favorite as an old southern lawyer),Chris Rock, Kathy Bates, Barry Levinson, Larry King, Ray Liotta, and musician Sting. Even Oprah Winfrey takes a turn as Judge Bumbleton.A nicely entertaining animated bee movie.SPOILERS: The bees succeed in convincing the judge that humans are unfairly stealing all their honey, so all the honey on store shelves and in warehouses is collected and given back to the bees. But since the bees actually consume so little of it, they had to shut down operations. Bees used to working now had a life of leisure. But a much bigger problem arose, without bees spreading pollen flowers no longer bloomed, vegetables couldn't grow, and the world started turning brown. So the bees had to salvage a bad situation, got the last flowers on Earth, in California at the Rose parade, flew them to NY in a jet plane, and began re-pollinating the world."
229,Bee Movie,7,27 March 2008,More Kiddie than for whole family,"I enjoyed Bee Movie, don't get me wrong, but the humor was lacking the ""for the whole family"" quality it claims to have. Yeah my parents laughed at the pop culture jokes, and my five year old sister laughed at jokes about gas and other bodily functions, but there was little in it for me, I can't completely rag on bee movie though, I loved Chris Rock's cameo as the moose blood loving mosquito, and Jerry Seinfeld was great. Some specific complaints I have other than the humor are that the bee movie universe was a little bit to cartoony, with the leaves shades of purple and pink, if your going to make the movies style like that why do it in CG, why not just go with old fashioned hand drawn? Another thing I held against flick was some of the kiddie jokes, I mean do we really need an old southern lawyer running around in a baby walker in a movie with Jerry Seinfeld? Even with the problems Bee Movie never ceased to entertain, but I still have to say I walked out of the theater a tad bit disappointed."
230,Bee Movie,6,19 January 2008,Okay,Not the best movie I saw of 2007 (that would go to P.S. I Love You) but it was pretty good. My favorite part was probably when they were in the airplane coming back from the Parade of Roses and he knocks out the captain and first officer. Being a flight attendant there have been times I wish that would happen on one of my flights. There were some funny parts and great lines. But it to be a little long and the honest the story didn't flow that great. Personally I didn't understand that Bary didn't know what not having bees did. Oh well. Nothing in life is perfect. It was a fun movie and enjoyed it. I think that you will too if you haven't already seen it.
231,Bee Movie,,27 November 2007,is it good?,"Is this movie good? Well I've heard it is, but I don't know... my friends went to see it, and by the next day they were saying how ""cool"" that movie was. I asked them what was it about, but they answered me with 3 words: ""i'ts about bees."" LOL. That sounded ""cool"", (I guess). Well I think ""Bee Movie"" is or could be like Shrek; I have the feeling it is a good movie just like Shrek was. I also think that ""Bee Movie"" will have a second part because ""if Shrek had it, why not Bee Movie?"". So, I hope I have the chance to see it and then write a better comment, because this comment was for an assignment... LOL. Ms. Nuval, I hope you read this comment...."
232,Bee Movie,3,19 November 2007,Disappointed,"Don't waste your time going to this movie. I ended up leaving the theater and sneaking into American Gangster(which is a great movie). I think they spent more money on the advertising than the actual movie itself. Just a money grabber no real quality intended. Don't even bother bringing your kids to this one, unless they like bee's and horrible story lines. There were a lot of big name actors but only to suck you into buying a ticket to see this crap. The whole movie consisted of a bee trying to get rights, and for humans to stop stealing their honey. The animation was very poor and had no real realism to it. Don't get me wrong, the previews fooled me. I was expecting a marginally funny and good show from the Bee movie. Sadly I was just in awe how awful this movie really was. I did get a laugh out of it though with my friends. Don't spend another dime to go to this movie."
233,Bee Movie,7,11 November 2007,boe_dye's review of a b-Movie!!!,"First off, before i begin i would like to say that by the time i was done watching this film with my wife and my friend, i felt that someone had removed my brain, put it in a smoothie machine, pushed puree, poured it out into a brain shaped tray, froze it and did it all over again.To say the least it made my head spin in how many times the direction of the movie changed...So, aside from the blatant caste system theme of the film, i will say that it was enjoyable. as it was we were looking for something light hearted where we didn't have to think to much about what was going on and enjoy a Sunday evening out.(our other choices at the time were American gangster, dan in real life, and martian child. so that is what i mean by heady...) Quite honestly, it did have a lot of chuckles and laughs. not so much of the cynical seinfeld that we have grown used to over the year, but just simple and fun humour.Kid's probably will love it as they loved shrek, flushed away, and the rest of the suite of movie that follow the same style.I know that we all certainly enjoyed it...Now the flip side...While i do believe that children of all ages will enjoy the film, one of the things that kinda annoys me about it were the blatant philosophies of a caste system. the entire message of the film was essentially be happy where you are and quite messing with the status quo cause if you do, then the world will be a disaster.Essentially telling young minds that you should choose one job and no matter what it is you should stick with it forever and ever without ever having any hope or ambition to become anything more then your allotment.Bee's in particular are the perfect example of that philosophy.Now i know that someone out there is reading this thinking that children wont come away with that message and that i am reading into it too much, and so on and so forth..........Anyway, so as i was saying the movie without a doubt goes from a movie of curiosity, to rebellion, to a love story, to a political diatribe, and then finally brings it back to saying that, again, we should all just bee, just be, just be....Oh and the anti-smoking sentiment was so coyly placed in there that i almost missed it...So boys and girls, in retrospect it is a funny and entertaining movie, and you to can learn to just be, just be, just be whatever the ""queen"" gives you a choice to be, a, b, or c. it's not totalitarianism because the ""queen"" in her benevolence has given you a choice to pick which job you want to do in order to better the society."
234,Bee Movie,5,10 November 2007,Mildly amusing,"A lot of dry jokes and comments basically describes this movie. They have a lot of double meanings going on but the most you get out of it is a smile. I thought that I would be laughing throughout this movie but it turns out that the only lines that I laughed at, was Chris Rocks' lines- they were funny! (Which is pretty sad, since he only has about 10 lines in the whole movie) The whole story itself is also a little bit too much- I wont write what makes it like this, no spoilers, but let's just say it like this. A weak story line.SOOOOOOO, Basically what it all boils down to is this- Fairly amusing, but not HAHA funny, and absolutely has no chance of measuring up to Ratatouille or Nemo etc."
235,Bee Movie,6,11 November 2007,BEEn there Done that!,"It's a bug's life for the hive of busy little bees in BEE MOVIE. One little fellow in particular, Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld) is a little disillusioned. After graduating from his class, he and fellow worker bees need to choose their chosen vocation.With working options limited, and a job that lasts a lifetime, good old Barry B. Benson is a little confused. He wants a life outside of the hive  a life with the tough pollen jocks. So, the intrepid little yellow and black adventurer goes in search of his true calling.What he finds turns his world and the bee world upside down: humans are exploiting bee labor for commercial purposes. More importantly he finds a special love with a human being in the form of Vanessa (Zellwegger).So begins a massive court-case to bring bee justice to the hives of the world.This is nothing more than a cute little bug film. There are plenty of heavyweight celebrities lending their voices to this caper, so listen up and enjoy some light-hearted cartoon entertainment."
236,Bee Movie,6,10 November 2007,Just My Opinion,"Warning some spoilers.I went to see this movie with my seven year old, to which this movie is vaguely geared towards. However, I did notice many adult undertones.Such as a bee having a relationship with a human. Don't get me wrong it wasn't sexual, but her current boyfriend did become (semi)violently jealous & attempted to kill Berry. Also there was some talk of incest, yes all bees in a hive are related, but I thinking joking about it isn't something geared towards children. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie. There were some LOL moments. Such as when Berry has a dream sequence where he & Vanessa where flying, Vanessa was in a glider. She crashed into the mountain side & I almost spit my soda on the person in front of me while laughing. And, some of Jerry Seinfield's jokes were funny, but his supporting cast really helped the movie along. Vanessa stabbed her hand with a fork & poured coffee in the floor after Berry first spoke to her, & Adam Flayman stinging the opposing council in front of an entire courtroom. Also Berry's uncle & Mooseblood talking about interspecies dating. All of those scenes really helped the movie along, as they were meant to.There was an environmental & a political points made in this movie. The political point was that using the court systems to get what you want can sometimes come back bite you. Berry sues the human race on behalf of all honey bees because of humans consuming honey. The bees win & the honey surplus is returned to the honey bees, which leads to the environmental point. If bees stop making honey, & pollinating flowers, then nothing blooms & all plant life ceases. Ultimately the bees, helped by Vanessa, save the last of the flowers, & save the plant life. Which in turn, saves the planet.This is decent movie, but I wouldn't waste my money on it at the theaters. This is a rent me, possibly a buy if you like bee's or Jerry Seinfield."
237,Bee Movie,7,10 November 2007,Come on guys. Lighten up,"This movie has been getting bad reception. It's got a 51% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and only a 6.6 out of 10 here on IMDb. I think this movie is very underrated. It's not that bad! Really.It's a nice film. It made my nieces laugh and we all had a good time. I don't know why it's criticized so much. I guess people just don't ""get"" the movie's message, or maybe they didn't like the somewhat silly and light hearted tone of the movie.The voices of the characters were a nice match. Jerry Seinfeld did a good job bringing the voice of the lead character, Barry out, Renee Zellweger was a good choice for the part of Vanessa, and Patrick Warburton was funny as Ken. The plot was imaginative and clever, and with a cast of colorful and likable characters, it truly was a pretty good film.Is it a great movie? Well, no. But its not bad either. It's definitely not the best animated film ever made, but it was a fun time and it achieved it's goal in making me laugh. I definitely won't be watching it again, but it was a fun little movie.My Final Verdict: A fun but forgettable look into the life of a bee named Barry."
238,Bee Movie,,10 November 2007,Well done,"I thought this is a well done movie more fore all ages.As time goes by I felt cozy and laughed more.Not a stupid comedy but true laughter.Also Renee Zellweger's surprising voice change is just lovely.The ending which is Bees' reconcile with human seems a little cheesy but not too bad for children so I can bare that.Even the most animation hate friend of mine laughed a lot which I think is a good sign.I think this movie will have more audience as time goes by.By the way, I am 30 something and my friend is 40 something."
239,Bee Movie,7,5 November 2007,really enjoyed it and so did my kids......,"i went into this movie thinking... ""ok, let's see what dreamworks has got themselves into this time... hope it's funny."" i was pleasantly surprised. this movie was very entertaining for me, my 20 yr-old sis, my 12-yr-old, AND my 4-yr-old.my 4-yr-old is ""addicted"" to honey and really wanted to see this movie, b/c it's the process of ""how honey is made"" and the bees that do it. after watching this movie, my pre-schooler still loves honey and wants to see it again. it DOES have a message- no matter how small your job is in this world... you make a difference. it educated the kids on what it is that bees do, pollination and not just making honey. it was educational, funny, cute, warm and actually made me want to go back also.i recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and see a ""feel good movie"". i'm proud to say that this movie is up in my list of ""the only movies that dreamworks made that were good"" (chicken run, wallace & gromit-curse of the were rabbit, over the hedge and flushed away are on that list). i'm adding bee movie. and i give it a solid 7 of 10.bee seeing ya'"
240,Bee Movie,7,2 November 2007,A Good Family Film,Hey well lets get to it!!!! Me and my g/f went and saw this movie 2night bc rly we had no other choice since she can't ride with me and this was playing in are small town at the local theater lol which only plays one movie but anyway there are several things about this movie that are good and a few that are bad lets start with the good shall we. Its a pretty funny movie it made me crack up through most of it.The plot to the movie is a little dumb but i'm 18 years old so i guess thats why since this movie is for little kids.There's absolutely no language in the movie and as far as i can tell there's nothing bad in it a good movie for parents to take there children to see.So in conclusion i have to say i enjoyed most of this movie.
