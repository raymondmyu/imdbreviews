0,Open Season,10,1 October 2006,"Great movie, quit bashing it!!!","I can't understand what everyone is fussing about this film for. I saw it on the IMAX 3D and I honestly thought it was hilarious. I caught myself laughing out loud on many occasions. Seriously, this film is not ""violent"" by any means. To me, I really felt relieved to see some humor and scenes similar to the old Looney Tunes cartoons that used to be considered great, but are now considered evil and horrible.I took my 4 year old daughter to see this movie as well, and she absolutely loved it. I have no reservations about any of the content in this movie, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with children. Any of the ""adult"" humor was tastefully done and, honestly how many small kids are gonna pick up it? The animation was well done, the cast was great, and there were some very creative action scenes in this movie. I wish all of these politically correct hypocrites would stop trying to psychoanalyze every damn film that comes out and bash it into the ground! Bottom line: This movie is outstanding, and it is incredibly funny!!!! GO SEE IT!"
1,Open Season,7,9 October 2006,See It In IMAX 3D,"The kids loved it, and I was not bored, and that is more than what you usually end up with these days. The 3D IMAX is truly amazing, if you are already paying the theater admission then IMAX is definitely the way to go. The story is not original, to say the least, but they know it and keep it short. I liked the voice talent, although this ""the wiener dog has a German accent"" thing gets old fast. A lot of people seem to hate this one with a vengeance (look at the distribution of the votes with all those people giving 1), but it still gets a 5.5 average, so that gives you a pretty good idea. This is no Incredibles by any means, but the two little girls I took enjoyed it a heck of a lot more than Cars. Mostly harmless family fun with a few bathroom jokes thrown in: enjoy!"
2,Open Season,10,5 October 2006,Are you kidding me?! 5.5?! I had so much fun watching Open Season!,"I was very much looking forward to seeing Open Season on it's first weekend, but I was a bit worried when I saw only a 5.5 on IMDb, because normally, most of the users are right about these movies. But my friends and I still wanted to see this fun looking picture, so we saw it tonight and may I say that I am surprised by you IMDb users who didn't like this film, everyone is entitled to an opinion, I agree. But seriously, how could you not like this film? It has amazing animation, fun characters, and hilarious jokes for kids as well as adults! After a bear, Boog, saves a deer, Elliot, from becoming another trophy for an evil hunter, Shaw, they become instant friends. But since Boog is a pampered bear, Elliot wants in on the room service, but ends up getting Boog in some trouble and back into the woods, together they decide to get back to civilization, trying their best to avoid open season from other hunters as well as getting away from Shaw. My favorite character is the porcupine, he was just so cute, ""Buddy!"". Especially, the scene where the dame explodes causing a huge wave of water to splash over the woods destroying everything and moving all the animals away from their safe place and the porcupine sees Boog and Elliot and just smiles and happily screams ""Buddy!"" while getting swooped up into the wave as well! It was so funny! Seriously, people, learn to have some fun, I know this was a kid's movie, but my friends and I had a great time watching this movie. This is one of the best movies I have seen of 2006, hopefully, the rating will go up. To those who loved this movie, thank you for having a good sense of humor, to those who didn't like the movie, just give it another shot, please! :D 10/10"
3,Open Season,6,12 October 2006,Knock-off of every CGI animated movie previously released.,"I'd have to agree with the critics on this one. When you release so many CGI movies with talking animals, there is a point at which mediocrity becomes common place. Open Season is no exception.It seems to me that a lot of these movies released this past year revolve around this basic formula. 1) A plot involving talking animals. 2) Hire celebrities to do the voice acting (need at least one comedian). 3) Have a main character and an annoying obnoxious sidekick. 4) Have some simple plot in which the main characters are on a journey and have to reach from point A to point B.When watching Open Season, I couldn't help but notice the parallels to Shrek. Boog (the bear) = Shrek, and Elliot (the deer) = Donkey. Need voice actors? Easy, let's hire two comedians (Mike Myers & Eddie Murphy vs Martin Lawrence & Ashton Kutcher). Plot? Well, let's just make them stranded somewhere and they have to reach from point A to point B. In this case, from the forest to Boog's old home. Of course, I could make the same case with Finding Nemo (comedians Albert Brooks & Ellen DeGeneres, main character and sidekick, travel from point A to point B plot).Now don't get me wrong, I love Shrek and Finding Nemo. The problem is that when you have two great movies like these released previously, you can't help but notice how much Open Season recycles from previous movies. Open Season lacks any emotional charm or comedic originality. Another problem I had is that a lot of the jokes are based on clich√©s and stereotypes (Scottish squirrels? Male deers = high school jocks? Ducks = French resistance? Female skunks = black women?).If there's any redeeming value in this film, it would be the fact that I watched it in IMAX 3D. It looks amazing. Wearing the 3D glasses, I could see each individual patch of fur on Boog's back and the characters literally came out from the screen.Is this movie good for the kids? Yes. It had some laughs in it and it does bring about a moral message about the preservation of wildlife. It's a good way to kill and hour and a half. But don't expect to see anything new or original in this film."
4,Open Season,9,3 October 2006,Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher strike again.,"I laughed so much through this movie I know I will have to see it twice because I had to have missed some of the funny parts. Very clean, which was surprising since Lawrence was in it, but so worth the time I spent watching it. It breaks your heart when Beth has to leave Boog in the woods but to see him overcome all the obstacles thrown in his path, is very amusing from the eyes of an animal. Aston Kutcher was hilarious as Eliot. I didn't realize he could be so funny and amusing. This movie I highly recommend to anyone with children regardless of their ages, if you want to spend time with your children in a clean environment. I intend to go back and take my neighbors children to see it also."
5,Open Season,6,2 October 2006,Who'd have thunk?,"Matin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher rock as the big bear ""Boog"" and the comic sidekick deer ""Elliot"". Unfortunately, the story was bland and the jokes were only mildly funny, so it will not be one of the best kids movies you're going to see this year. The ""Laugh out loud"" index was maybe a 5-10 (laughs per movie). ""Over the Hedge"" was closer to 20-30 for comparative purposes. ""Boog"" and ""Elliot"" were well played. The Scottish squirrels, Beavers and Rabbits were funny, but the rest of the characters didn't make much of an impression. Although somewhat entertaining, it was quickly forgotten after we left the theater (with the exception of the Austin Powers like shadow scene behind the curtain). If you need to take the kids out to a movie, this is funny enough to make it worthwhile, but don't get your expectations up to high."
6,Open Season,5,2 December 2006,A Nutshell Review: Open Season,"OK, this year alone probably saw a record number of talking animal animations, with countless of punchlines filled with pop culture references, and big name stars attached to the projects, that it's about time we give the genre a good break, rather than churning them out continuously with more misses than hits.And Open Season, probably the last one on offer this year from a Hollywood studio, suffers from this glut, unfortunately. Heck, with so much similarities between the movies, you can even spot a familiarity or two from the story lines, taking a a leaf from one of the earlier flop - The Wild, in having one of its stars here, part of a popular animal attraction, and another part from Over The Hedge, where a group of animals must band together for survival and a fight against adversity.The leads for Open Season are a domesticated grizzly bear who has its own teddy bear soft toy (don't ask), and a mule-deer with one half of its horn sawn off. An unlikely pairing, a ""loser and a loserer"", voiced by Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher respectively. It's strange that there's a reversal of voice roles here, as Lawrence's Boog the Bear is uptight, while Kutcher's Elliot the deer is built in the same old wise cracking mould as Eddie Murphy's Mushu in Mulan, or Donkey in Shrek. In other words, Boog frequently gets punk'd by Elliot.It's one of those recycled plots about loneliness, and having two misfits finding themselves in each other, relying on strengths from the other party in order to survive in new environments. A misadventure sees Boog go back to the wild, with Elliot in tow, and the two have to find a way to get back to civilization where Boog belongs. Along the way they encounter other critters in the woods of course, paving the way for some comedy and more recycled themes of bullies and the likes. Don't believe the trailers though, as the war between animals and humans, doesn't take up much screen time.The sad part though, is that there aren't many funny moments to distract you from the rehashed story lines and subplots, but then again, it's a made for children movie. As always, there are some of the weaker characters which get used as punching bags, and here, this role belonged to the mindless rabbits, which some might find irritatingly adorable. My vote however goes to the nasty Irish-accented squirrels, defenders of their pine trees with their nuts, and in second place, those insane beavers.At least the animals don't break out singing songs every now and then, though there are some nice musical numbers that went along with the movie. But all in all, this movie isn't as entertaining as, say, Over The Hedge, and neither is it as bad as The Wild. But don't say I didn't warn you if you find this a tad too boring.Wait for the DVD, and rent it. Oei!"
7,Open Season,6,1 October 2006,Somewhat Funny,"It was a cute kid movie. It made me laugh. I really liked it. My mom and sister really liked it also. But I was sort of upset at the way they treated the poor rabbits. I mean come on, who can't like those big eyes??? I feel so sad for them. The hunter guy was sort of scary in away. I felt sorry for Elliot with the way both of his horns got cutoff. Now that part was sort of sad. What was also sad was that Boog didn't go home with Beth. I like the movie altogether I guess. I thought it was aimed for kids from the ages of six-eight or nine. The propane tank was a nice touch. I loved how many animals wanted to come to the ""safe"" place with Boog."
8,Open Season,5,24 December 2009,Bear Hunt,"Predictable kiddie fare with okay animation and some good throwaway moments here and there.Nothing we haven't seen before, but mildly entertaining and not without its charms. But the overall air of second hand fodder remains intact all through its running time. There's no real heart to all the cartoonish goings-on.The character work is lackadaisical and the bland songs should've been omitted.Some of the sidekick critters are funny, though.5 out of 10 paranoid hunters"
9,Open Season,8,29 September 2006,Fun for the whole family! A great start for Sony Pictures Animation!,"What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.Martin voices the lovable Boog in the film; he's the main attraction of a show at the zoo with his best friend, Beth (Debra Messing). Boog also lives with Beth, equipped with his stuffed animal, Dunkleman. On a completely side note, what would a Sony film be without a reference to one of their own. Before Boog settles in for his comfy night sleep, he checks out Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune.They have a great life together doing shows for the fans, even exchanging powerful roars. But that's before Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) shows up, the hapless one-antlered deer who's been captured by the evil Shaw (Gary Sinise). Boog helps Elliot escape and makes Boog's and Beth's life miserable, forcing Beth to send the two animals away into the forest.On his own for the first time, Boog now has to rely on himself, or be stuck with Elliot. And that means figuring out how to go to the bathroom in the wild. That's when he first runs into McSquizzy, the squirrel (voiced by Billy Connolly) ¬ñ McSquizzy is the ruler of the forest trees, and has a great and powerful squirrel Army to back him up, equipped with thousand of acorns. Without a doubt, McSquizzy is one of the highlights of Open Season! He's got wit, humor, and a ton of Scottish charm.Boog realizes having Elliot around is the only way he'll get back to Beth. So they become 'partners,' much to the dismay of Boog ¬ñ but the delight of Elliot, who just needs a friend. With hunting season right around the corner, the two must work together to sneak around the hunters.But when Shaw breaks the hunting season date, the animals switch their thinking ¬ñ instead of running away, they're going to fight back! And fight back they do! Trying to run away, Boog crosses a dam; unfortunately, his 900 pound body crumbles the wood.That's when Open Season turns into Hill Street Blues! There is one of the most amazing chase scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Boog, Elliot, and their porcupine friend try and escape the gun shots of Shaw ¬ñ but on water. Bobbing and weaving through the water, under water, above water, around rocks ¬ñ great scene! There's even a waterfall at the end to top it off! I have somewhat of a test for animated movies I've been giving myself over the past few years ¬ñ ever since seeing the water scenes in The Incredibles, and noticing how real it looked, I've started to take an eye to the screen. If water doesn't look real, than it doesn't pass the test. Let's just say, Open Season aced my test. This water chase scene goes on for about 5 minutes, maybe a little more; but it's so exciting and amazing to watch! It's not just the water of Open Season, it's the entire field of animation; the animals really come alive on the screen. I'm a huge fan of animation; I think it has to do with the fact that anything done with computer fascinates me. The detailed description of each character, from their eyes, nose, mouth, walk, and hair ¬ñ and in this movie, fur; it's just so amazing! But back to the story - after meeting back up with the group of beavers, led by Reilly (voiced by Jon Favreau), some of Elliot's former deer mates (Patrick Warburton and Jane Krakowski), and a few other animals, Boog and Elliot team up and go on the attack against the hunters. Bras, plungers, grills, forks, knives, spoons, and basically, anything they can get their hands on ¬ñ sorry, whatever they can get their paws on ¬ñ they use to charge the hunters with.Open Season is directed by Jill Culton, Roger Allers, and Tony Stacchi; each has a number of major credits to their name. Both Tony and Jill make their feature directorial debut on this film; however, Jill has worked at Pixar on the character development for Monsters Inc. and Toy Story. Tony worked on a number of films for ILM including Hook and Ghost. Roger Allers co-directed The Lion King, and has just recently completed The Little Match Girl ¬ñ a short attached to The Little Mermaid.Open Season is a fun and very enjoyable film for kids and families. It's definitely a film you'll be talking about for a long time. And don't forget, you can also check out the film in IMAX 3D, opening at major theaters across the country."
10,Open Season,9,2 October 2006,Great animal welfare message!,"Way beyond Elmer Fudd vs. Bugs Bunny (I keep reading reviews saying ""been there, done that"")! Not only was it a very cute, entertaining flick, but what a wonderful message regarding animals - anti-hunting, respect their territory and don't try to domesticate what is not meant to be domesticated, even a plug for spay/neuter when they point out Mr. Weenie is ""fixed"". The animation was good - aside from one or two odd looking creatures (the little doe), I thought they were cute. And the campiness of the scenes added a little something different. All the actors who did voices did a terrific job. I am not a Martin Lawrence fan, but he rocked as Boog. And Ashton as Elliot was hysterical. It's no ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Toy Story"" but for a cute flick one afternoon, it's better than expected. Enjoy!"
11,Open Season,10,20 September 2006,"Wild, wild life!","I saw an advance screening of ""Open Season"" earlier this evening (the only advance screening I've ever been to that started at 6pm, which must've been done so kids could see it and still get home at a decent hour).I laughed out loud and heartily during the hour and half watching this movie than I have during all the comedies I seen in the past year. The animation is so good it's distracting during some of the close ups (check out the fur on Boog the bear and the main star). And all the forest animals were fully fleshed out character wise and very funny (especially the ""take no nonsense"" pair of female skunks). They were cute without being precious. And the script was Oscar worthy. If you don't love this film a part of you is dead inside. It's just that good.Summary: There's this bear (Boog) who does a circus type act in a National park who lives with a park ranger. He later frees a young deer (Elliot) from the hood of a hunters car (the guy hit him and knocked him out before tying him to the hood) who follows him home, tempts him with a candy bar, which lead to a little b & e in a convenience store where they pig out on junk food. Through a series of events they both wind up in the forest just as hunting season begins. The animal bond, give the hunters hell and all ends well (especially for one of the skunks).Remember how good you thought The Incredibles was?, this movie makes that look like so much ho hum it's not even funny.And if you don't like it, go out and make your own film rather than tear this one apart."
12,Open Season,4,22 March 2010,"For the whole family, if the family has low standards.","The idea for the film must have sprung to the mind of the writers while watching a certain toilet advert. A bear on the toilet? That is hilarious, isn't it...? Well, no, it isn't.What you get here is a bland 3D flick. The characters, the story, the animations, the jokes.... Pretty much everything is awfully stereotypical of the genre. You can point on the various sources the writers lend their ideas from. The whole thing lacks heart and atmosphere. And the jokes don't even reach average sitcom level. Nothing in this whole thing elevates over the absolute bare minimum the genre asks for. It's not really bad, it's just bland and boring.Rather watch any Pixar movie, even if you have seen it a dozen times. ""Open Season"" even then is less entertaining in comparison."
13,Open Season,6,4 February 2007,"Cute, a few laughs, nothing original","I saw this movie today and I have to disagree with those who compare it to ""The Incredibles"" or ""Cars."" It's only slightly above average and not in any way original. There are a couple of laugh-out-loud scenes: When Boog and Elliot are fighting behind stage curtains and to the audience who can see only their shadows on the curtain, it looks as if Boog is gutting Elliot and splashing blood everywhere (actually the ""guts"" are ropes Elliot is tangled up in, and the ""blood"" is paint); and the scene where Elliot is explaining to Boog how to go to the bathroom in the woods, and suddenly just lets go with a stream of deer nuggets (thank heavens they don't show the grizzly dropping his droppings, though).Silly, harmless fun (except for the bunny abuse ... what was up with that?), but again, nothing at a ""Cars"" or ""Incredibles"" level."
14,Open Season,8,15 October 2006,It's cute... plain and simple!,"OK... I'm a hunter and I usually roll my eyes at animators with their anti-hunting stance. The ones that make the hunters look like jerks and the animals are much smarter and more in tune with nature... blah, blah, blah! So, this movie does all of that, but I laughed throughout the movie! No one should take themselves so seriously that they can't laugh at what's going on around them! Silly fun, good popcorn movie and entertaining to boot! I've got to admit, I'd never imagine Martin Lawrence as a Grizzly Bear, nor see Ashton Kucher as a one antlered deer, but someone had insight and imagination! Go and enjoy this silly movie... it has a couple of bathroom jokes, but what doesn't these days!"
15,Open Season,2,1 October 2006,Looks like a compilation from other 3D movies,"If somebody decided to make a TV series based on Shrek, but because of copyright issues replaced main heroes with a bear and a deer - that would be Open Season. Oh, add a little bit of a plot from other animation features, few standard jokes and gags and 3D for IMAX and ""disney""-style music and what else? ""Crowd goes wild""? I do not know, but frankly there is nothing else... No, your kid may love it, if he or she has not been spoiled already by seeing the same plot, same heroes and same jokes over and over again. May be this movie is just another example, that technology alone - and here I mean not only computer animation, but also marketing and audience targeting and all this corporate style product building efforts - is never a replacement for real talent. I wish Sony Animation Pictures to be more revolutionary and less corporate in the future and not opt out for low budget TV style production."
16,Open Season,1,16 January 2007,Worst movie I have ever seen! Stay Away!,"I'm not one to totally bash something, but nothing in this movie was slightly entertaining. If I could, I would rate this a zero.My cousin (11) had wanted to see this movie so I agreed to go because I was baby-sitting her. We walked in a few moments late and had to sit in the front seat. About 20 minutes into watching it, I started counting how many times I said this was the worst movie ever. I haven't done that since I saw Legally Blonde with my sister.The humor was non-existent, the characters were one-dimensional and I haven't seen such a boring plot-line since Napoleon Dynamite. The most entertaining part of the whole experience was watching the kid next to me react to the movie.To put it short, run away from this movie as fast as you can. If you want to see something that kids and adults will enjoy, go see Night At The Museum or rent a tried-and-true movie from Blockbuster."
17,Open Season,2,27 January 2009,boring movie,"It may take a whole but this movie was really boring and lacked a great plot and setting. The animation was decent and the characters look very odd and funny. Boogg the bear was weird and acted so dumb most if the time while Eliott the deer was just annoying and wasn't funny. The connection between the two was odd at first but eventually picked up. The hunter was also annoying and was just somehow always there at the right time and place hunting Boogg and Eliott. Beth the owner of Boogg was pretty normal but still lacked a lot. The movie seemed very boring from the start to finish. Although it gets better towards the ending, its still quite boring. And it wasn't funny in the least bit, all of the ""jokes"" were clich√©d and didn't flow together. I didn't laugh once while watching Open season. I don't recommend anyone to watch this garbage, hopefully the second film is better but i wouldn't count on it."
18,Open Season,7,2 October 2006,"A funny, sweet film!","I saw this over the weekend with five 9-year-old boys, three 40ish adults and my 72-year-old mom. We ALL enjoyed it and thought it was cute and funny! It's too bad that it had to be released at the tail end of a year with so many other animated movies, but I think this one holds up against any of them for entertainment value. I thought the voice casting was great, and I LOVED the music. It was a simple story that you know is all going to work out in the end, but that's just fine with me. If I want complexity and angst and dark endings, I'll go see something else. And I've GOT to learn all the words to Elliot's version of ""Teddy Bear Picnic""..."
19,Open Season,3,25 March 2007,Even Wathcing With Open Minded I Still Find This To Be Rather Boring.,"I'm a fan of animation and will watch absolutely anything and everything. So I'm long awaited for this film cause in the trailer it seem so cool and funny. Oh boy, this film totally let me down badly. I think I laugh one time during the movie and fell a sleep twice.Synopsis: Boog a domesticated bear was release into the wild few days before the open season. There he fined himself force to befriend with a deer and another animal if they all wish to survive the open season together.I don't think I'm too old for this and I always open minded when it comes to cartoon but this it was merely boring. I don't want to be judgmental but it feel like the movie was created just to rival another animal movie like Over the Hedge, it like just for the business part rather than well thought movie. The story is a total riff-off from various movies, the worst part is they don't even hide the fact that well. The character doesn't even have originality. And everything seems so abrupt and cut short.I don't really mind about some of the humor it has but I was wondering where was all the humor gone this is practically humorless, maybe it also because they already shown all that in the trailer. The animation was all right and nothing great compare to most high profile studio animation. And the animal was too alike that it doesn't really work well on screen, the cuteness is gone.The used of big star was a total unnecessarily cause every character has the voice change that you can't even recognize them. Overall I was very disappointed by it. It has a very shallow abrupt story, compare to Pixar cartoon this feel like an amateur work.Recommendation: If you've Seen Trailer, You Have Seen Everything. Not Worth Even Rental.Reason To Watch: Trick To Watch, Force To Watch By Your Son/Daughter.Reason Not To: The Story Is Too Abrupt and Brief. Boring.Rating: 3.5/10 (Grade: F)"
20,Open Season,5,27 September 2009,"All looks, no personality","That sums up Open Season perfectly. The film was designed to be shown in 3D, and they make sure you know it by making crap fly out at the screen every few seconds. This has been a bad habit of 3d movies from the beginning, and one that doesn't show signs of stopping if the upcoming ""A Christmas Carrol"" is any indication. But it's not all bad. The story behind Pixar's Up was so absorbing that you actually forgot it was in 3d. Coraline was even more effective with 3d, completely absorbing you into its surreal, stylized world. But I'm getting waaaay off-topic. Open Season's 3d effects are in-your-face and obnoxious. There, done. Moving on...The film's visual style is minimal. Many of the animals seem like they were designed by Pablo Picasso, as they come in all sorts of bizarre, deformed varieties. Many of the animals introduced for no reason other than to summon a cheap laugh. Boog - one of the main characters - is annoying, whiny, arrogant and unconvincing. In other words, he's easy to hate. Elliot on the other hand... I expected this Ashton Kutcher-fronted character to be terrible, but he's actually a redeeming factor of the movie. He's very funny and has all of the best lines. The two tourists and their dog are funny as well. The villain is, well... pretty light. Don't expect anything more than a gun-totin' redneck. But at the very least he does create actual tension in one scene where Boog is hiding from him. It's when this film tries to become serious and deliver life lessons that it falls flat."
21,Open Season,10,1 April 2007,One Of The Best Animated Movies Ever,"""Open Season"" uses more adult and over-the-edge-humor than any other animated movie in the last few years. The characters are great. Much better than some animated side kicks we've seen this year. Ashton Kutcher, Martin Lawrance and Billy Conelly did a great job and also the music in this picture is very well chosen. The animation is brilliant and some shots will clearly blow your mind.This movie isn't just for kids. Adults will have quite a few laughs, too.Many people say that this movie is just like every other animated movie we've seen so far and the storyline seems familiar. But you could say the same about every damn horror movie or chick flick. Even if every animated movie had the same story, you still can find differences. And Open Season is a movie of it's own. So don't bug me.All in all you GOTTA see this movie."
22,Open Season,4,23 February 2012,"A decent, but uninspired effort from Sony Pictures Animation","I've just gotta say that I'm just a little disappointed in this movie. It's not bad or anything, but it would've been so much better. The computer animation has some nice colorful backgrounds, but it seems to be suffered by it's shallow character animation. The characters are either uninteresting or annoying except McSquizzy because he gave me a few chuckles here and there. The story, while having it's moments, is just painfully predictable that uses the same old ""buddy"" clich√© from other animated features. The humor has it's funny parts, but then it gets very tiresome it would make you snooze throughout the film. The strongest aspects goes to the adequate music score from Ramin Djawadi and the voice cast in this film. Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher did great and so were a few cameos including Patrick Warburton and Billy Connolly. Open Season is far from being the worst animated feature of all time, but with a better story and better characters, it would've been better.4/10"
23,Open Season,10,20 February 2016,Best film in animation history!!!,"Funny cast includes Martin Lawrence, Ashton Kutcher, and Debra Messing. Plot includes the sugar-crush, the songs, and more!!! Patrick Warburton adds to this cast of actors, plus we get other stars. So, if you rent a movie, or just buy one, buy this one (or rent it), I don't give two lamb shakes. Hahaha. Very funny!!!! Cool beans. Rock-n-roll, man!!!!! We love cartoon flicks, and music videos!! If you don't like Open Season, then do not blame me. Blame yourself. I love rocking out to soundtracks, do you? When can I see the two sequels? Only time will tell. Boog is a funny bear. And his buddy Elliot is a great mule deer. Please be kind-- rewind. Just joking. We don't rewind DVDs, I mean we do sometimes. We only rewind if we miss a moment or two. Sweet!!!"
24,Open Season,2,26 January 2007,Absolutely horrible!,"I always thought that high-budget, 3D-animation movies, would never fall so down to be desperate efforts to make money without a story, without humor, without good actors, without anything. Heck, even Martin Lawrence playing a lead role, didn't discourage me of going to the theater. But I was wrong. This is a sad, sad film. The acting was very poor. It's hard to say this for an animated film but it's true! Martin Lawrence just cannot act. It's true! His character was unBEARable (pun intended)! Ashton Kutcher's buck was sort of OK, I guess, but the rest of the cast should consider some serious voice-acting lessons.And what was supposed to be funny in this film? The plot was so boring, I almost fell asleep! Come to think of it a brief smile for ONE moment was all it got from me. Forget about laughing. Only one scene worthy of a single smile is what it would get from you. The 3D animation was done pretty good and I feel sorry for the guys that worked on it. They didn't deserve being part of this bull*&!% of a movie.Consider staring at the wall for an hour and half, before watching this movie. Hey, at least staring at wall is free!"
25,Open Season,,23 January 2007,Ahem.,"You know, this is really getting tiring. The collective brain cell of non-Pixar animation studios needs to adapt to a few simple facts: --A buddy movie is not the required format for an animated film, and should that format be used, the concept that the buddies are in fact homosexual need not be presented to the four-year-old target audience in a ratio greater than one joke out of four.--The remaining three jokes out of four need not involve bodily functions, indeed of any kind.--Casting animals as protagonists in a story is a time-honoured tradition, although traditional animated deer spend less time making genital-related comments to squirrels, and more time weeping over their deceased parents in a doe-eyed fashion. However, the use of animals in a film does not directly necessitate animating all the human characters in a way designed to put aforementioned four-year-olds off the species for life. Politically speaking, it might be deemed disingenuous to sidestep the carnivorous habits of many of the furry friends while condemning hunters as immoral.--Female skunks are a cheap shot.That is all."
26,Open Season,5,21 October 2006,Suffers by comparison - 56%,"Ever noticed how similar some films can be to each other, almost to the point where you think they're identical? The obvious examples, and the films which spring to my mind, are the lava-themed disaster movies (in every sense of the word) ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano"". Given the current trend and insatiable audience desire for animated movies, this retreading of earlier plots is even easier to spot ¬ñ I know people who still get confused between ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Antz"". Although there is nothing technically wrong with ""Open Season"", it does suffer due to it's unfortunate release date which is extremely close to ""Hoodwinked"" and ""Barnyard"". However, it reminded me of yet another domesticated-animals-in-the-wild movie ""Madagascar"" but trust me, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.In the heart of America's natural wilderness lies the sleepy hunting town of Timberline where the star attraction, besides blasting the local wildlife, is the grizzly bear Boog (Martin Lawrence). Boog's life is pretty easy as he's waited on hand-and-foot by girly park ranger Beth (Debra Messing). After a chance encounter in town with hyperactive dear Elliot (Ashton Kutcher), Boog incurs the wrath of hunter Shaw (Gary Sinise) and is forced from his comfortable home into the wilderness beyond with Elliot for company. During his quest to return home, Boog discovers that he just isn't cut out for life in the wild, especially when Shaw and the other hunters gather for hunting's open season.Strictly by-the-numbers it may be but ""Open Season"" isn't a bad little film. It's pleasing enough for younger viewers but there's still plenty to raise a smile for adults too. However, the problem is that the more movies of this nature you see, the less enchanted you become with them. Allow me to explain: the last movie I caught at the cinema was ""Cars"" and even then, it was only because there was nothing else to watch. It just didn't appeal to me and I'm a huge fan of Pixar. I should never have doubted them as ""Cars"" was a superb film, full of colour and fun and imagination. This, by contrast, felt uninspired and very artificial ¬ñ it looked like a cartoon whereas ""Cars"" looked almost real at times, at least in terms of landscapes. Even the characters didn't really appeal, partly the fault of the voice casting which also failed to match Pixar's excellent standards. Lawrence, possibly the least appealing leading man since Doug McClure, is actually the best of the bunch but given Kutcher's annoyingly high-speed delivery and precious little support from the rest, it's perhaps not that surprising. Even Billy Connelly was wasted as the freedom-fighting leader of a bunch of acorn-hurling squirrels. They may as well have painted his face blue and called the character ""Braveheart"".All of this sounds harsh and it is because ""Open Season"" isn't a bad film, as such. It's technically accomplished, fantastic fun for the kids and worthy of consideration for a family movie night. However, with standards improving all the time, it does fall quite a way short of the spectacular heights that Pixar have taken the genre to. Time and again, they show how to make an animated film that truly is for the whole family and they make it look easy. So far, only ""Shrek"" has mustered much of a challenge to them and that was quite some time ago and only because Pixar's weakest film (""A Bug's Life"") was out at the same time. The sad truth is that this is trailing the front-runners by quite some way but despite chewing on the dust thrown up by ""Cars"", this is an adequate way to treat the kids to an hour and a half in the cinema. Still wished my nephew hadn't come along ¬ñ I wanted to see ""The Departed"""
27,Open Season,6,29 September 2006,Over the Hedge better? what did you think,"I sat with my boyfriend, the room was packed with kids, when the movie started, the theater grew quiet. Somehow I thought the movie was....violent for some reason and the humor was adult humor. Nowadays, people try so hard to make it for kids and adults. Or maybe it was my mood that time, but I laughed more in 'Over the Hedge'. The development in characters were much better in OTH than this one. It was just same old same old plot where you have a self centered character who teams up with a chatty and annoying buddy that soon will lead you to decide that believe that you have to go back for them. Sorta like Shrek in a way and Emperors new groove (but those two were a lot funnier). There were random parts like the lady and the dog, that came out from no where. Rabbits that were abused...its just...all over the place! Anyhow, its a kids movie...it just didn't seem to tickle my funny bone though. And...the movie ticket was expensive nowadays, 9.50 per person."
28,Open Season,9,17 October 2006,"underrated, not disappointed","Although the group I went to see this movie was actually trying to get into Jackass 2, we were not disappointed. I laughed out loud at quite a few parts, especially the ones with Elliot the one-antlered deer (voice of Ashton Kutcher). He brings the same zany personality to Elliot that he does to Kelso in That 70's show. Martin Lawrence was good also, but wasn't his usual slapstick comedic self. The real scene-stealer, though, was the crazy redneck hunter Shaw (voice of Gary Sinise). Although this was a kids' movie, and I suppose Shaw was supposed to be the ""bad guy,"" he actually came off as the funniest character in the movie. So, this fall, instead of wasting 10 bucks on a poor sequel like the Grudge or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, take a shot with a movie that's sure to entertain: Open Season."
29,Open Season,1,27 October 2006,Shakes head wistfully,"I've come to expect Hollywood to fill their wares with their liberal viewpoints, but anytime they take a political viewpoint and build a cute story around it with a target audience that hasn't reached puberty yet I see it more as propaganda than entertainment. I will grant you that it's clever and witty propaganda - but that just makes it worse. Quick name a few movies where the hunters are good guys. Not easy, is it? It's easy to find hunters as bad guys though. A few obvious and animated ones (just to keep the list short) are this movie, Rescuers Down Under, and Tarzan. Maybe instead of vilifying hunters we should focus on responsible game management which includes hunting as part of it. Don't start dishing crap that responsible game management is not appropriate for children to understand and then turn around and preach animal rights. The Lion King at least mentioned the 'Circle of Life' but they left man out of it. There are millions of people in the US alone that engage in safe, responsible hunting and hunting is included in science-based game management programs everywhere. Most money for conservation programs comes from hunters and hunting-related businesses. Hunting is pretty mainstream - quit demonizing it. I know that most of you will think I'm making way too much of a fuss out of a children's movie, but children grow up with half-formed opinions that are rooted in all sorts of things they were exposed to as children. Then they start voting based on those half-formed opinions. Rant over."
30,Open Season,5,30 September 2006,Definitely bargain matin√©e fare...,"Saw this movie at the local IMAX in 3D, late Saturday morning matin√©e. Nine year-old daughter and girlfriend went with me. Other than very good 3D animation and the last, all too short, ten minute or so, animal rebellion episode, this movie was BORING.Martin Lawrence (Boog) does as well as he can with what he was given. Ashton Kutcher's Elliot character became downright irritating within his first ten minutes. The one bright spot and really funny portrayal was that of Billy Connolly as McSquizzy, the chest-puffing, Scottish brogue speaking leader of the squirrel packs. Also Patrick Warburton's portrayal of Ian, leader of bucks, was pretty good also. Being a Seinfeld fan, I immediately noticed the squint-eyed, blank-stare of David Putty in Ian. Nice casting on that one.This movie just seems to drag and drag along until the final rebellion sequence. Also, the dufus buddy theme has worn all to thin in these animated movies. At times, it seemed like this was Shrek 6.Seeing this movie in IMAX/3D certainly is a plus, because it keeps you from noticing how slow this movie goes.My five rating is due to the IMAX/3D being so good. Otherwise, it would be a two."
31,Open Season,1,21 September 2007,A waste of time.,"As the standard of animation continues to rise, its a shame that the quality of the features produces spirals downwards! Open Season is a prime example of how great animation doesn't make a good film. The film is completely let down by its voice actors.Boog is obnoxious and selfish, and in no way likable. Its not Martin Lawerence playing the character, its simply him turning up and being himself. Same goes for Ashton Kutcher who voices Boogs friend.The jokes are few and far between and the entire thing is a disgrace, acting as a quick buck for Lawerence and Kutcher.The studios should give some real thought to hiring professional voice actors, rather than actors, who at best have limited talent as it is."
32,Open Season,2,21 January 2007,"any spoilers? what, there is something to spoil in this movie???","yep, i can hardly remember anything about this movie, except there was a bear and some other animals. and yep it was greatly animated! in desperate search for the beginning, end and a plot you may see all of them clich√©s summed together in a cheap manner: Austin powers, typical Disney-like plot-try, a very, very, very bad try to rip off Shrek and HIS sidekick...it generally lacks - everything, but mostly the story. as if the Sony *MARKETING* guys made ""brainstorming"" picking the ""best of laughs"" - spicing it up with ""national"" kinda bias: Irish, Austrian, etc. whatever... and gave it to cg people.wrong. terribly wrong."
33,Open Season,5,22 October 2006,An above-average (for the genre) film with good pacing and a few very impressive moments,"Obviously, Bencich's screenplay is not one of the great works of film writing, but let's take a moment to appreciate it for its virtues. The film has better pacing than almost any other film of the time in this genre, and the key scenes are well-established and strangely engrossing.True, there are flaws in the film. A few of the actors and actresses have a kind of gross/scary look that seems to somehow be the result of the decade itself, and the score is maddeningly repetitive. Still, the good elements at least measure up to the bad ones.I was a little disappointed (as I imagine many were) that Debra Messing wasn't given more to work with. Even though she is given top billing and the titular character, she doesn't have any real dramatic moments until the end of the film.I have to say that the best actress of the picture was Caitlin Cutt in her small, but pivotal role.Though I wouldn't call Open Season a masterpiece, I would recommend it to any fan of the genre."
34,Open Season,,8 January 2010,A classic example of a bad movie,"This movie is bad, not ""cult"" bad, not ""so bad it's good"", not even ""funny"" bad, just plain old boring bad. It is so stupid and tiresome that the commercial breaks (we saw it on cable) were a relief.The main premise -- a domesticated animal trying to adjust to the wild -- is unoriginal but holds the potential of decent sitcom style laughs. Unfortunately the promise is unfulfilled, as you see most of the jokes coming from a mile off and the humour is aimed at the lowest common denominator. Some are repeated so many times that you cannot help but groan.Most of the characters are one-dimensional (the rest are more accurately described as zero-dimensional), they are nothing more than walking stereotypes, afflicted by both idiocy (no thinking skills whatsoever) and schizophrenia (behaviour and motivations change wildly from one moment to the next).To summarize: there is no plot to speak of, there is no acting to speak of, no suspense, no believability, no feelings for the protagonists or the antagonists (except annoyance), nothing notable or memorable.Not for lack of ambition, mind you. Open season takes every clich√©, every situation, every lame joke that ever (dis)graced the screen, tries to cram all of them into 83 minutes and doesn't even attempt to tie them together into a coherent whole.Out of the 6 people that watched it, 5 (me, wife, father-in-law, 12yo girl, 8yo boy) found it stupid and boring while 1 (5yo boy) liked it.So if you are in the 4-5 years-old demographic, you'll probably like it. Otherwise, there are better ways to kill your time."
35,Open Season,10,23 October 2008,Perfect Movie! Perfect cast! Perfect everything!,"A lot of times, we have our point of views on movies and stuff that don't always agree with the other person or it may do depending how you see it, but I can't argue with this. On September 29 2006, Sony Pictures has brought us the first animated feature and that film is Open Season. Successful or not, I don't care what people say. I believe in movies and movies should be love with respect! The story starts out about a 900 pound grizzly bear named Boog who was raised in the small town of Timberline by a pretty park ranger named Beth. His life takes a turn when he encounters a fun-loving one single antler mule deer named Elliot who is full of energy and high spirit. The movie follows them on their adventure through the woods, but a hunter named Shaw is on their trail from preventing them to get back home.The film has a lot of adventure, humor and good heart at the end, but it never fails me to see how awesome it can be. It's nothing like you ever seen! In my own views, animals are NOT meant to be hunted! They're not some winning trophy you can get for doing a good job no, they're just like people! People with thoughts and feelings. If you love watching animated movies, you'll love Open Season! Everything they have is absolutely perfect in it!"
36,Open Season,6,13 May 2007,The Third Act Makes the Film a Notch Better,"A grizzly bear named Boog, domesticated by a park ranger, Beth, helps deer friend Elliot escape from the mullet-sporting hunter, Shaw. When the Elliot decides to return the favor to help Boog escape from Beth he finds that Boog is very happy with his domesticated home. After a misunderstanding, Beth is convinced that Boog is reverting to his wild nature and releases him in the woods just as hunting season begins. Boog has no idea how to survive outside of his garage home with his beloved Beth. Elliott and Boog develop a strong bond not only between themselves but also with the wild animals and attempt to drive the hunters out of the forest.Out of countless animation films released in 2006, I was looking up for this but it was kinda disappointing that it's much more of a kiddy flick than for teens or adult, although there were some inappropriate jokes for the children.The animation in the film was okay, not as good as Pixar's and the action sequences in the film is great but that only appears mostly at the third act of the film, which made the movie a bit better. The other part of the film is just boring but might be fun for the children.If you're somewhat older than a child, you probably won't like this film but children will like it, since, well, it's another animation flick from one million others released in 2006."
37,Open Season,7,17 February 2007,"solid,very funny animated comedy","""Open Season"" is a very entertaining animated film.i like the eclectic mix of characters.i really liked the dynamic between the 2 main characters,A domesticated bear named ""Boog""(voiced by Martin Lawrence)and Elliot(Ashton Kutcher)a displaced mule deer with no family.i also though the dialogue was very good in this movie.there are some great one liners.there is also an abundance of action,(some of it very funny) and there are also some dramatic moments.dare i say it,this movie treads very close to being hysterical in some scenes.also,the choice of actors for the voices is brilliant in this movie,especially Lawrence and Kutcher.for me,""Open Season"" gets a solid 7/10"
38,Open Season,6,10 July 2017,Open Season: The start of a new journey.,"In 2006, Sony Pictures Animation decided to make there move and make there first animated movie! Open Season. To be honest, it's actually a good start for the company. The movie is actually not that terrible! There is adult jokes in the movie. For instance, in the beginning when Ranger Beth was going to show that domesticated bear Boog was going to do, Boog see's some hunters while driving down and Boog decides to slap his butt in front of them. Extremely unnecessary, but funny too! It's a great movie for mature kids! 6 out of 10!"
39,Open Season,6,30 June 2014,"Quite a good entertainment, but not more than that","The story is nice, looking at hunting activity from the perspective of the ones being hunted. It is also being developed well with having additional complications. But the whole thing doesn't seem to hold together. The funny stuff doesn't really get funny. Martin Lawrence and Ashton's Kutcher's effort for crazy voices did just a little to help the movie to be funny. One strange thing I notice is that only Elliot, the one-antler goofed up mule deer that is the animal which stands on his rear feet beside Boog the Grizzly bear. It's quite normal to see bears and smaller critters like rabbits, squirrels and skunks portrayed standing on their rear feet because bear do that in reality. But concerning Elliot, he is the only other big animal who does that, while the other mule deer, including his love interest Giselle, stands on all four legs."
40,Open Season,1,1 October 2006,Hollywood does it again...,"Thinking this would be a creative, well-written and original story, I trudged to the theater to view this film, even though I had great skepticism. Why did I do that? This film was nothing different than Finding Nemo, The Wild, A Sharks Tale, Toy Story, etc. Same thing, over and over again. When will something new finally come out? And I am so disappointed with the message it sends. I just love how the Libs in show business like to make hunting and hunters the ""bad guys"". They depict hunters as ""Shaw"" in the film, a poaching creep who shoots just to kill, not for sport and for the true ethics of the sport. When will someone do their homework and see that hunting is the best for of conservation out there; keeping ""Boog"" and ""Elliot"" from being smashed by cars and starving to death because of over population. This film makes the younger generation fearful of hunters and I was disgusted."
41,Open Season,4,17 October 2006,Overall a stolen plot,"alright,this was an OK movie.But the idea of talking animals has been wildly overused.Also,the movie had somewhat of a ""Shrek"" theme.Its the 'im not going to be your friend' but then at the end of the movie the mood changes to 'oh ill be your friend i love you' But while it did have its funny parts (the otter using a chainsaw/right after i saw the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) (the Scottish squirills) (""well need your nuts!"" ""And your acorns too!"") Don't worry,for those of you who saw those lines don't worry,because it was probably,like many children movies,overly advertised on TV and sold cheap toys at Burger King and McDonalds.But like I mentioned before,the movie did have a Shrek kind of feel to it.*as said by myfilm83"
42,Open Season,4,16 December 2006,"OK, Shrek-like story...","1st watched 12/15/2006 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Jill Culton, Roger Allers & Anthony Stacchi): OK, Shrek-like story about a couple of animal misfits who link up with the rest of the animal kingdom in the backwoods to fight against the human hunters when it's open season. The story starts off as a pet-like grizzly bear named Boog(voiced by Martin Lawrence) has it easy living in the garage of a kind of circus-like handler of a outdoorsy show for the parks department. Ashton Kutcher is the voice of a deer who arrives mounted on the car of a hunter and Boog lets him go. Boog then gets released by his handler to the wild and the Shrek-like imitation starts with the two trying to be Shrek & Donkey on a trek to get back to Boog's original home. There are some funny scenes with Kutcher being his goofy self in a great role for him and some classic uses of normal objects as weapons in the fight scene against the hunters, but not enough to sustain the full-length movie. The music(another attempt at Shrek-imitation) is also pretty lame. This movie will definitely not last too long or be recognized as much in the annals of animation history, in my opinion."
43,Open Season,4,24 July 2009,Leave Open Season closed,"How could Roger Allers, (oscar nominated director of the Lion King) make a movie like this. Open Season is just a rehashing of Bambi, The Jungle Book, Ice Age, Madagascar and several others. Not a molecule of originality exists here, and it addition to being plot less and pointless, it's not even funny. I found myself chuckling a bit, but seriously this is a waste of time money and talent. Talking animals has become such an overused archetype that it's pretty gimmicky today. Open Season takes that to extremities, the only thing that could be worse is probably Open Season II. To all parents out there, do not choose this as a family watch, your children will hate you for it."
44,Open Season,7,12 May 2007,Doesn't compare,"This animated film is not bad, maybe even quite good but it doesn't compare to any of the many other Disney films such as Finding Nemo, The Incredibles or Shrek. The animation was quite...interesting, different from many other films. The voices were fine, the plot was reasonably thin but it still kept me entertained for the duration of the film.I suppose they did well enough not to use fish in another animated film so they were successful on choosing animals that I don't think have been used in any (or many) other animated films.My suggestion to you is that if you see this film in blockbuster then get Shrek instead but if this is all you can get then don't worry, it isn't bad."
45,Open Season,,27 March 2007,It's Snot What You Think,"Get by the left coast hatred of hunters and firearms and you're left with the mildly entertaining animated feature, Open Season. It's all blandly amusing to the wives and kiddies in the audience, and for me, a man who supports hunters' rights, yet has never hunted, there's a feeling that my time could be better used, but why bother. I'm with my family.The thing I got most out of Open Season was the feeling that the makers of this harmless scat wanted to play with the big boys at Pixar and Dreamworks. There's something about a technical breakthrough at Sony that made the characters pop out on screen more, but the story is so weak that the critters get deflated.I was wondering if I disliked Open Season because I don't care for Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher. Gary Sinise can do almost no wrong, but Debra Messing has to be seen instead of just heard. Probably the only character that made me laugh out loud was the Scottish squirrel, Billy Connelly. I kept seeing him in Mrs. Brown, flapping about in the surf, and the two images, both with nuts assaulting your senses, kept me chuckling.How's that for weird! Anyway, Open Season is a guaranteed money-maker, so grinching about it is pretty much pointless. If you do rent it, watch for the blue porcupine that keeps purring, ""Buddy?"" That's what made the wife and kid chuckle.Compare that with my Billy Connelly story and you'll have a whole new sense of the weirdness of your humble movie critic."
46,Open Season,6,26 January 2007,Fun family cartoon with a nice sense of kiddie depth,"Fun, well paced family animated film may borrow nearly everything from previous cartoon entries, but still manages to present some resemblance of freshness with it's skewed take on animal instincts. Giving these animals their sarcastic human counterpoints is hardly a new idea, yet in this country woods setting the antics do not feel as derivative as I might have guessed. Perhaps it is the left-leaning attributes of these filmmakers: the redneck-bashing, pro-environmental message guided by our sarcastic furry friends that keeps the movie somewhat engaging for the chaperones. Not without it's share of heart, Open Season will be completely predictable for adults, but sadly remains more witty, fun and vibrant then Pixar's last somewhat confused entry ""Cars"". While certainly not on the technical level of artistic competence that seems to be dominated by the Pixar clan, the visuals employed here are beautifully serviceable, never overdoing any of the poignant nature rendering so as to overwhelm the basic morality tale in glitz. Voice acting as well seems completely serviceable, with lead Martin Lawrence in particular rising above your typical cartoonish cheese to deliver many genuine moments as the title character Boog, a gigantic, domesticated bear who is having a tough time making his way in the wild after being brought up in luxury. Asides from the consistent, heartfelt humor, this gentle concept goes the extra mile with an engaging theme that again puts imaginative children into the perspectives of a different set of fun-loving, morally-abiding, trouble-bringing animals."
47,Open Season,10,14 November 2006,Loved it!,"I took my 2 year old son to see this. We live on a small post in Germany, so its rare that we get any good kids movies. So anyway, we almost missed it because my husband never set the clocks back, and we raced to the theater. Thank goodness we did! My son, who never sits still, didn't budge once. He even laughed! I thought it was great and had a good story line. Even my husband, a 27 year old red neck deer hunter, laughed so hard he was tearing. This movie was not violent like I've found other kids movies to be. And I know some people have been saying its racist, but I didn't get that at all, so I doubt a 3 or 5 year old will. I cannot wait for this movie to come out on DVD as I'm sure it will be one that will get played until the disc skips."
48,Open Season,7,23 October 2006,Decent movie - okay for my 5 year old,"It had its moments. I took my 5 year old son to see it. I was a little concerned because it was PG, but it wasn't bad. The worst swear word I heard was ""crap"", so not too bad. Scary for about 5 minutes when the bear is hiding in the hunter's cabin. Typical toilet humor, which goes great for the 5-10 year olds.Overall, it was a good movie. Some funny stuff for the parents who have to take their kids to it. I liked the Braveheart references. The rabbits were particularly funny.Although the ads make it look like the movie is about the animals fighting the humans, that is only a tiny piece of the movie. It is mostly about a fish out of water story, which makes it a bit dull because we've seen a lot of those."
49,Open Season,9,17 October 2006,Animals are taking over the world!!,"Wow...don't you just love talking animals. This movie was so cute and funny. I especially loved Boog. He was so adorable. I also loved that little porcupine who kept saying ""buddy."" This movie is definitely great for a child to see with his/her family, or even for three girl friends to go and see. I don't think anyone could be too old for the humor in this movie. Furthermore, I liked the whole idea of what it may be like if animals could take charge. Maybe then, some idiots in this world could get what they deserve. No, but seriously, I did like the whole idea. Sometimes, I wonder if our world would actually be a better place. Animals are just such loving creatures unlike many of us. lol"
50,Open Season,7,3 October 2006,Non epic cute fun,"I read the reviews on IMDb before I saw this movie, and was pleasantly surprised. Not just because my expectations were so low, but found it to be quite enjoyable altogether.It is naughty enough to entertain adults with its mild sense of black humour (if you like rabbits, prepare to be offended), and cute enough to charm the political correct. The animations themselves are absolutely on par with the best out there, and one scene where the animals race down the wild river is quite remarkable.It is, of course, totally predictable, and brings home nothing new or extraordinary. It delivers exactly what you would expect. Just shut off your brain, enjoy the colorful animations and occasional laughs. Well worth a look..."
51,Open Season,3,10 October 2006,Totally pathetic animation film,"Open season is one of the worst animation film from last years(if not the worst).This movie is a copy of Madagascar,The wild and Over the hedge.But it seems that the animated movie with animals is a new clich√© because coming soon,there are movies like Happy Feet,The barnyard and Ratatouille which are more animated movies with animals.This movie was extremely boring for me and I watched my clock all the time.I don't recommend this pathetic animated film;maybe for little children(from 1 year to 5 years old)the movie is fun.But for older children and for adults this is pathetic and totally boring.Rating:3"
52,Open Season,4,7 December 2006,below par animation and script,"We've come to expect better animation these days. Cinema released animation had better be A grade in story and jokes if it doesn't deliver in art. Almost all the good jokes in this film were shown in the trailers, which wisely avoided showing much of the humans, which is where the art really failed. Hoodwinked was way better than this, and hoodwinked was only average. Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher don't make a good double act, and Debra Winger must have done this with a bad hangover. Billy Connolly was fun, and Patrick Warburton has one of the best comic voices in cinema. These two lift the film if not out of the script's hole then at least to the rim of it."
53,Open Season,6,10 November 2013,Certainly not Pixar,"Wild deer Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) leads domesticated Grizzly bear Boog (Martin Lawrence) to the outside in search of candy. They ransack a convenient store and then the next day, they disrupt a park show. Boog's trainer park ranger Beth (Debra Messing) has no choice but to release Boog into the wilds right before Open Season. The two has to lead the other animals in the forest to fight against the hunters.Sony Animation is still unable to catch up to Pixar in terms of technical quality or story writing. It's a good enough movie but in no way in the same league as Cars which opened at around the same time. The characters lack the cool or interesting look. The story is functional but isn't inventive enough. Animals and hunters in the wild seems like scratching the surface of the imagination process."
54,Open Season,,18 July 2013,Maybe it's a moonburn. Check it out,"'Open Season' is an adequate family entertainer. The colourful and lively visuals make it pleasing to the eyes. The characters are likable too. However, the film has nothing new to offer. It certainly doesn't stand out among other recent animated features. The story itself has been told and repeated numerous times. It's your typical 'coming of age' back to the wild plot. The comedy at times feels overdone and some of the characters are clich√©d. The voice acting, especially by the supporting voices, is very good. Billy Connelly's voicing of the squirrel was terrific. In the end, while 'Open Season' is no classic, it's not a bad film and it has more than its moments and is cute enough to be a decent popcorn entertainer."
55,Open Season,8,22 April 2013,Most spoiled bear you will ever know !,"Two comedians give life in this animated film to a bear named Boog and Elliot a very naughty deer. Beth is Boog's mistress she takes care of him, gives food a shelter in a garage where it is treated exactly as a pet and he in turn provides some entertainment for the locals. Everything changes when he meets Elliot. He is intentionally hit by a car and placed on the hood by a hunter. Boog helps him escape but Elliot can not forget and goes at Boog's home to thank him and plans to stick with him. He can not accept that and get's rids of him. Then he make his appearance at one of his shows and behind the scenes gives the audience a frightening scene but of course is not what it seems but even so people get scared and run. Then Beth decides it's time for him to go in the wild but as he is accustomed to city life can not live in the forest and how it is with Elliot make a pact with him, that shows the way to the city on condition they become partners. It turns out that Elliot was lying and does not know the way, it goes on random through the woods where Boog meets the other animals who make fun of him but when they hear that there are a few days and start hunting season everyone allies to ban the hunting. Beth find out what is happening and decide it's time to bring Boog home but he realizes that he can not leave his friends and decides to stay with them in the woods. A funny movie overall. I liked it when the two stormed into the candy store and ate everything they found but hilarious is Elliot who is more agile than the big bear Boog and offers several humorous scenes. And Ashton's voice fits perfectly."
56,Open Season,8,14 December 2012,"Cute, Funny, Great Message","This film is very cute, it makes me laugh, and has a great message. Boog (Martin Lawrence), a grizzly bear, is unwillingly taken out of the comfort and warmth of his garage. He is far away from his owner Beth (Debra Messing) and is stuck in the forest with a very annoying mule, Elliot (Ashton Kutcher.) Boog is trying to find a way to get back to his garage and owner, but hunting season is just starting. Will he be able to make it back to the safety and comfort of his home in one piece? Well, you must tune in to see. I like this film because of the comedy, the background music and the plot is very easy to understand. I think the talent does a really great job with the voice-overs and fit the part well. I love animated films and think the animation in Open Season is really good. My favorite part is when Boog is trying to catch some fish because he is hungry. So when he goes to the river to do his fishing, the fish slap him right in the face. Boog is left standing there extremely humiliated. My favorite character is Elliot, because he has a free spirit, funny and he keeps me laughing. Here are few of the people that make this film possible and do a good job. The directors are Roger Allers, Jill Culton and Anthony Stacchi (co-director). Some additional voice-overs in this animated film are, Gary Sinise (Shaw), Billy Connolly (McSquizzy), and Georgia Engel (Bobbie). A message I found in this film is that you can't always depend on someone else to take care of you. One day they might not be there to protect you, so you have to look out for yourself. Boog is used to Beth taking care of him, but once he enters the forest he has no idea what to do. I recommend Open Season for ages 6 to 13; they will definitely get it a kick out of it. It's good film for the family to sit down and enjoy it too. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It has a good message, the animation is great and it is an enjoyable film. Make sure you get a glimpse of the forest in Open Season. Brianna Hope Beaton, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
57,Open Season,7,18 April 2012,They should have stopped here,"My first review on this site as a registered user was Open season 2. I had, of course, previously seen Open Season 1 and then just a few weeks ago saw Open Season 3. Seeing all of them now (and the 1st for the second time) I can now exclaim that they should have stopped at this movie.I was okay with it for the most part. The things that bugged me most was just the bear giving in and becoming friends with the annoying animal that almost ruined his life multiple times. I do understand the message, however I found it kind of odd and didn't make the movie as good as it could have been.Anyway, it's still better than the second movie and definitely better than the third movie. Thus, I rate it 7/10."
58,Open Season,5,19 April 2008,"Blurry not Furry, not Funny:  Don't bring small children","This movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be, a ""feel good"" Disney-type movie, an NRA bashing social commentary, an adult-oriented humor piece, a cartoon, a photo-realistic animation...and so if fails on all levels.It's supposedly pro-animal rights. But the animals themselves are bashing each other. It's supposed to be anti-violence (anti gun-toters) but shows animals blowing up trucks into fireballs and glorying in it, as well as enjoying inflicting pain on a human who is literally already down. Too violent for small children and the animation is off-putting because, as I mentioned, while one of the characters (the Eskimo policeman) and the scenery are realistic (sometimes breathtakingly so), the other characters are cartoony, so the violence doesn't have the innocent ""cartoon violence"" quality of old-time Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd flicks.Hunt elsewhere for quality entertainment, especially for children."
59,Open Season,6,23 May 2007,"Good, but I feel there are lots of problems indeed...","This could be MUCH better - this film is good, but it is well and truly annoying. 1. Parts of the plot are unoriginal (two characters make a promise and another one breaks the promise for just about no reason). 2. Boog is irritatingly stubborn. 3. The deer apart from Elliot and Giselle could easily not appear (they are INCREDIBLY cruel to poor Elliot). 4. Billy Connolly could be funnier. 5. This film gets slightly boring after a while. I like Elliot and Boog's owner. Oh and the baddie is very annoying as well, for one thing I constantly think he needs a shower when I see him up on screen. Oh and there are too many dirty loo jokes which could have SO easily been replaced by different ones.Boog is a bear living the life of human luxury. His future changes when he meets Elliot, a one- antlered deer..."
60,Open Season,6,2 May 2007,"Buddy, It Wasn't That Bad (SPOILERS)","SPOILERSI really did not want to see Open Season, and had no interest in it. I saw it anyway, and it was way better than I thought, especially with the 5.9 rating. The reason I am giving this a six is that some scenes were too annoying and crude. Some scenes also had me laughing for ages. Who can forget the porcupine and his ""Buddy?"" That was probably my favorite character. I mean, ""buddy"" never gets old, despite the fact that it was used fifteen times throughout the film.Here is the plot of this film. Boog is a pampered house bear who lives with a ranger named Beth when he saves the life of a mule deer named Elliot from a hunter named Shaw. They become friends. Elliot wants to save Boog from his home, despite the fact that he happily lives with Beth. Then, during a nature show, a riot occurs, thus putting Boog and Elliot in a National Forest three days before Open Season, or hunting season. Elliot and Boog try to find Beth, but they learn how rowdy the forests are, with Scottish squirrels, ninja fish, and porcupines. Then, Open Season comes. Shaw with other hunters hunt down the animals, but not without a fight. The animals gather supplies and attack the hunters. Beth then comes in a helicopter. Boog then decides to stay in the forest with everyone else.Overall, this is a fun movie, but it was actually a lot like Over the Hedge. Besides that, this has great computer animation, a solid cast, some fun scenes, a porcupine who meets a ""Buddy,"" and a bittersweet ending, like a lot of these movies have. This also, of course like a lot of these movies have, a soundtrack. Not a score, but a soundtrack, like Shrek has. Anyway, this is one of those films that is not for everyone, but have fun with it and have a good time.6/10 Recommended Films: Over the Hedge, Shrek, and Shrek 2."
61,Open Season,6,7 April 2007,"Ironic, isn't it?","The movie wasn't making fun of hunters so much as fools and conspiracy nuts. Like people who see ""libs"" behind every movie they don't like, say. LOL! Okay, it's not Ice Age or Shrek but it's still very funny. And does anyone think that hunters *wouldn't* be villains from the perspective of of your basic talking deer or bear? Elmer Fudd ring any bells for anyone? This theme is venerable in American animation.Open Season is definitely worth checking out if you like modern animated satire at all. It's different enough from others of the genre. Where else have you seen a duck put the bite on a hunter with his own dentures? Some of the cgi is quite impressive, too.But what is it with the darned rabbits?"
62,Open Season,9,12 December 2008,It was totally Fun and Awesome,"The movie was totally fun and awesome. Amongst the animals, Boog is Very funny and cute. Shaw looks like a pucca villain. When, Boog and Elliot were destroying the shop, that scene is totally funny. Even, Elliot is very funny. The last scene was totally awesome and cool. When, Boog is hiding in Shaw's house, that scene is totally thrilling and funny. When, Boog is going for toilet near the bushes, that scene is Totally Funny. When, Boog is seeing the forest and that time he worries that he lost everything, that scene is totally funny. When, Boog breaks the dam And the water releases, that scene is totally funny and awesome. When, Elliot is tied in a rope, that time he talk to Boog with fear, that Scene is totally funny. When, Gordy drops Boog into his house that Time Beth and Gordy will be talking and Boog disturbs their talking, that time Boog is very funny. When, the animals are fighting in the last scene, that time they were awesome and cool. When, Beth is travelling the helicopter with Boog and Elliot that time the background music is cool and the nature which comes in the scene is very beautiful. When, Boog asks Elliot that where is Timberline, that scene is very funny. Even, the nicknames of Boog and Elliot are very funny. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Open Season""."
63,Open Season,10,12 February 2007,Elliot!,"He's a deer , he's my favorite. He's the one played by Ashton Kutcher. Did They choose a name for a deer? I have the game , I rented the DVD. Who would Elliot end up in a dump? Elliot is so silly , I like to print him on the internet! Elliot is inverted for the down antler for my logo. He's so silly , I feel in deer! Elliot is just a deer with comedy and crazy. Let's Go Crazy! Elliot. You silly deer. Ashton Kutcher is the best actor to play Elliot , he would even say ""Dude , Where's My Antler?"" and then Elliot is so cool , he will even say ""Deerabunga!"" , It is a 3D character since Marty the Zebra and Franklin Fizzlybear. Ashton Kutcher was so having fun at the premiere and what happened? His Remaining antler fell off. He would have to shed and grow his antler back. Elliot will say ""Call Me The Incredible Mister E!"". He has a favorite quote , ""I get it , you're like a pet."" , Elliot sings the sing in tune of the Teddy Bear Pincic Song. Uh-Oh-Uh-Oh , I Wanna Lose Control! Take Me Out , I said you need to know Elliot got crashed into the door since Punimart was closed. Elliot is a deer , my mom would laugh even louder."
64,Open Season,10,10 February 2007,Great family feel good film,"This film is Great, no other word for it it will have the whole family cheering and laughing there is not as many adult jokes as Shrek but the jokes that do happen are so funny and silly it doesn't even matter! i went to see this film after it had come out for a bit and thought oh god there is nothing else on but was highly surprised. and ended putting this down as one of my favourite films of all time now. i normally go for a intelligent film such as the wind that shakes the barley but this light hearted animation was a great change. on a personal scale i give this film 10 stars and perfect for half term to keep the rug-rats busy and maybe the older rats to :-) thank you and i hope you found my review useful."
65,Open Season,9,5 February 2007,Wasn't another one of those corny animation things,"I was expecting another hoodwinked because in hoodwinked they showed seriously EVERY funny part in the trailer, and then since you watch the trailer ten thousand times because you want to see the movie so bad that the actually movie isn't funny at all because you saw it all in the trailer. And I thought that maybe this was another one like that but it was hilarious and very clean except for I think about 4 or 5 ""dangs"" which was more than I wanted but less than I was expecting. I love the entire thing although it was too short, but if it was longer we'd probably think it was dragged out so maybe it's better off short. but it kept us laughing during the entire thing. Ashton Kutcher was great for the part of Elliot and I love Billy Connolly. Everyone was great though I didn't really ""know"" any of the others actors/actresses. Grab a friend, get some goodies and have a BLAST!!!"
66,Open Season,8,28 January 2007,A very enjoyable kid's movie!,"I'm very surprised at all the negative reviews of this movie. I took my 4-year old grandson to see it, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it! The negative reviewers must not have kids--or else are judging this movie by adult standards. I recommend this movie highly to anyone with young children. On the way out of the theater my grandson had two questions: 1) Can we buy the movie now?, and 2)Can we see it again? The DVD comes out tomorrow, and I'll certainly buy it for him. The animal characters--particularly the bear that lived in the garage, and the one-antlered deer that convinced the bear to return to the wild--were likable and funny! My grandson laughed (and almost cried) at different parts of the movie. And thank goodness it had a happy ending!"
67,Open Season,9,4 November 2006,"Great fun, and best animation I have seen","I saw the movie today with my kids (8 year old twin boys), although I saw the Norwegian version (not my native tongue) so I cannot comment on the voices of the originals. Which seems to be the biggest gripe on the message boards.I thoroughly enjoyed it, in fact for me it is the best animation I have ever seen in my life. The plot is pretty much the same variation that we have seen from Madagascar through The Wild to... well you know what I mean. The ol triumph over adversity including obligatory journey.Where this differs for me is the quality of animation, the scenes involving water were just mindblowing, the movement of the coat of the bear, and for me the motion of the helicopter blades was out of this world.I know that sounds a bit anal, but visually it truly is spectacular.The gags were good quality and the interplay between the two main characters starts full of energy and progresses nicely enough.The obligatory 'crew' of supporting characters worked well and provides good comic relief.Oh yeah and the kids loved it too!"
68,Open Season,7,30 October 2006,One of the better cartoons lately,"This movie was done pretty well to be honest. I figure since Eddie is making the Shrek series, Martin Lawrence had to get on board with making a cartoon. Eddie he is not and honestly, he does not try to be. Ashton Kutcher is completely obnoxious and you can tell he wanted to stretch the bounds of good taste if he could get away with it. Anyone who creates a show called Punk'd and considers it a runaway success needs to stretch the boundaries whenever he can get away with it. He definitely can be seen as the obnoxious character he plays and Martin Lawrence has calmed so much over the years, you can see the mellowness in his character. I rather enjoyed going to this one and it was a heck of a lot better than ""The Wild""."
69,Open Season,6,22 October 2006,Open Season is amusing enough for anyone who loves animation,"Martin Lawrence voices a domesticated bear and Ashton Kutcher voices a hyperactive deer. They cause havoc at a closed convenience store in Timberline and are sent back to the woods. When open season begins, they defend themselves against hunters, especially a bloodthirsty one voiced by Gary Sinise, with the help of beavers, ducks, skunks, rabbits, a herd of other deer, and an army of squirrels led by a Scottish-tinged one voiced by Billy Connolly. What starts as fitfully amusing becomes hilarious by the time the animals vs. hunters sequence begins. Not up to Pixar standards, perhaps, but still worthy for the whole family to watch and get amused by. Additional voices by Jane Krakowski, Georgia Engel, Jon Favreau, Patrick Warburton, and as the bear's motherly ranger, Debra Messing."
70,Open Season,7,20 October 2006,Want some fun?,"This film i thin was purely made for fun, i know its a comedy and your thinking ""isn't that what all of them are made for?"". Well not in this kind of way. I mean, it obviously was never going to be a shrek or a Monsters Inc, this was just going to be a kids idea of The Godfather (which here i will count as the best film ever). This is because of the huge amount of toilet humour and slapstick, funny voices and just downright silliness.So, if i was going to rate this on greatest movie kind of meter, i would give it a 5, looking at the unfinished graphics and the unoriginal comedy. But, as i rate for enjoyment, or something along the lines of that, then i give it a 7. Not bad i say."
71,Open Season,8,16 October 2006,Thoroughly enjoyed,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Sure, there was a little raw humor but it was not over the line. And truly, without it, the movie might have been a little boring for adults. Elliot was great. Loved his one-liners. I took two little girls and their mother along and we all laughed throughout the movie. One thing I've noticed in many movies is that the trailers contain all the good stuff and the movie has nothing more to offer. Not so with ""Open Season"". I will buy this one so I can watch when I need a good laugh. I read some of the other comments - all I have to say is - don't over analyze - just enjoy!Stands out in comparison to other kids movies."
72,Open Season,9,15 October 2006,Favorite animation,"This is definitely my favorite animated comedy. When I watched it at a local movie theater, everyone was laughing, the adults as much as the kids. There was no back-door, off-color humor for the adults to snicker at and pass meaningful glances over, it was simply funny: good, clean fun across the board. My 3-year-old granddaughter made it through the entire movie, usually she can't do that. She laughed a lot, although, part of that was from getting caught up with the laughter in the the audience. It was probably the visual funniness that she was able to latch onto within the movie itself, a few times she also caught the funniness of some dialog, evidenced by things she would say. It was visually funny, the words were funny, it was a great movie that I could see again and again. I had no idea it was out in 3D, and now hope to see it at an IMAX.Most of the animals were equally funny. The ending is priceless, too. Another review mentioned Looney Tunes, and I can see a comparison, a bit. The animals make these little ""aside"" comments now and again, maybe a lot, I don't know, but one of those times is when the dachshund makes a comment to the audience about its owner that just brings the house down, so tongue in cheek it is, it takes a second to absorb the surprise, and then it is funny to remember for weeks. The dachshund's comment reminded me of something Jack Benny might have popped out with impromptu if he were alive. And if Johnny Carson were alive, he would fit into this movie REALLY well as one of the animal characters, maybe as an animal that got tickled over things, not that Carson would make the movie better, my point is that such a character could fit into this entourage delightfully. To me, it lives up to that kind of quality. Many of the reviews, though, appear not to reflect this high regard, and I find it hard to understand why everybody doesn't agree that this movie is stellar. In comparison, Over the Hedge was not so memorable. I recall it being acceptably funny, but it quickly faded into a distant memory. Open Season will be with me vividly for years, even if I don't get to see it again. I would say that a comparable regular movie would be Mr. Deeds."
73,Open Season,8,13 October 2006,"You Can Take A Bear Out of His Domesticated Home Life, But You Can't Take the Domesticated Home Life Out of the Bear!","Meet Boog. He's a tame grizzly bear living the good life. He's got a roomy garage for a home complete with food, water and toilet. He and his owner, park ranger Beth, put on a show for the young ones, who simply adore him. Everything was going great, until one day a gruff and crazed hunter named Shaw roared into town with a dead deer strapped to the hood of his truck. Open hunting season was just around the corner, but Shaw had decided to start early when he mowed down the innocent creature who now only had one antler. Boog took notice of the deer, who turned out to be alive. He introduced himself as Elliott and proved to be quite the talker. Boog decided to help free Elliott, which he might later regret. Later that night as Boog slept soundly in the garage, Elliott came by and gave him a rude awakening. He coaxed Boog into coming into town and together they ransacked the Punimart, pigging out on candy bars, squishees and junk food. Needless to say, the town sheriff wasn't too pleased about this chain of events and wanted Beth to take Boog back into the forest, but she just couldn't *bare* to let that bear go. The next day as Boog was preparing for his next show, Elliott showed up to cause more trouble, which resulted in he and Boog having a fight. From behind the curtain, it looked as if Boog were gruesomely mauling Elliott. Well, enough was enough. Beth sadly had to airlift Boog, via helicopter, into the forest in a secluded spot above the falls to avoid the hunting grounds, and left him.Boog awakened to find himself in a strange place, far from home. But what was worse, is that he ran into Elliott. It would appear the two would have to work together, because Boog wanted to go back to his home in Timberline and Elliott said he knew how to get there. And so, they trek through the forest and sure enough, after going in circles a few times, they were finally on the right track. Boog had a run-in with a few territorial squirrels while Elliott butted heads with his old herd; after a day of traveling, Boog and Elliott formed a bond and as soon as they returned to Timberline, they would be partners in Boog's show. But then they came to a familiar site: the same beaver dam they had passed the previous day. Clumsy Elliott had been leading them in a circle again. To make matters worse, Shaw drove up in his pick-up and had a loaded rifle in his hands. Boog tried to run across the beaver dam, but it just couldn't support his weight and gave way, washing the bear, the deer, the hunter, the beavers, the ducks, the skunks, the porcupine and all the woodland creatures down the waterfall and into the lower valley: hunting grounds.Boog called off his friendship with Elliott and went off on his own. By nightfall, he came upon a log cabin, so he went in, not knowing this was actually the home of Shaw. Boog helped himself to the food in the fridge and sat in Shaw's chair, glad to be domesticated again...until he saw the many mounted heads on the wall. Macabre hunting trophies. There were beavers, ducks, skunks, even a lone antler--Elliott's. Boog left Shaw's cabin and soon came across the road. Looking down the road, he saw...Timberline! He was almost home. Unfortunately he also saw pick-up trucks loaded with hunters carrying loaded guns. Open season was tomorrow. Boog had to do what his heart told him, so he raced back to the woods to warn Elliott and the others of their approaching doom. They formulate a plan to stand up and defend what was rightfully theirs. So, they acquire supplies from a camper and when dawn approached and the hunters gathered their rifles, the animals launched their attack. Spraying them with skunks, hurtling various items at them, and, blowing up their pick-ups with a propane bomb dubbed ""Mr. Happy"". The bewildered and bewitched hunters ran. The animals basked in the glow of their triumph, when suddenly a helicopter touched down and out came Beth, destined to bring Boog back home. But these few days in the woods had taught the bear a thing or two, and showed him his rightful place, so he decided to give up his previous domestic life and live in the woods with his new friends. And so, Boog and Elliott became firm friends, and the woodland animals became their allies, and they all lived happily ever after...as for Shaw, long story short: fell in mud, got covered in leaves and debris, a hippie couple took him to be Bigfoot and took him home, tied to the roof of their camper. He won't be harming any innocent critters for a while.Open Season...I found it to be very entertaining. It was funny, it was the perfect length. Not too long and not too short. Martin Lawrence (Nothing to Lose) is the voice of Boog, Ashton Kutcher (The Guardian) is Elliott, Gary Sinise (Forrest Gump) is Shaw, Debra Messing (Will & Grace) is Beth, we've also got Jane Krakowski, Jon Favreau, Billy Connolly, Patrick Warburton, and Matthew Taylor. All were very good in their parts. The story was good, it was good at developing the characters, and the CGI was done very well. If you're looking for a good animated film to take the kids to this fall, and you like this current talking animal genre, then Open Season is for you! Open Season, from 2006. I recommend it!"
74,Open Season,7,13 October 2006,Don't know what others didn't see.,"I don't know what other people are complaining about. This movie was pretty funny, much funnier than The Wild or Madagascar. It wasn't the best, but it still had some good parts. It is not 100% original. The idea of Boog and Elliot trying to find ""something"" (don't want to spoil anything for you) is like Shrek and Donkey. There were some original parts in the movie. The animation could be a little bit better. The characters were drawn nicely, but I can't say much for the environment. The voices were done pretty good. Also, I don't think the character development was enough. There seemed to be a few dead spots in the movie where it didn't really contribute to anything.All in all, go watch this movie. Although I didn't get to see the last 15-20 minutes because I was theater hopping with my friend (the movie we really went to see was about to start), I thought it was good enough for a review. Trust me, this is much better than the recent The Wild and Madacascar. I gave this movie a 7/10 because it was a fun watch."
75,Open Season,10,7 October 2006,wow,"This movie was funny...i was impressed i thought it was going to be dumb or boring, but it was not..and BTW....how the hell is this movie racist..just because they have a black man playing the role a bear does not ME ANYTHING..i think your the racist person how wrote the comment..i mean really shin color has NOTHING to do with ANYTHING..i think you'r dumb,....if you ca actually PROVE that the movie was racist then call SONY PICTURES and email them and say hey..I'm dumb your movie is racist and you know what they will say to you. well they wont say anything all they will do is LAUGH cause thats what i did after i read the comment they will tell you to F*** off cause your dumb"
76,Open Season,3,13 March 2009,The known characters,"In modern television we seem to be seeing the same characters over and over again, for comedy. That's all right with me because these characters are the only one that actually sell. Now for movies it is different. In movies the character can be as weird and unreal as the writers want him to be because that kind of character might actually be real for the script. Now, when I first saw Open Season I actually found it funny, and interesting. It was recently shown on TV, and when I saw it I felt like watching Madagascar. For those who have not seen Madagascar it is about a zebra in a zoo who dreams about living in the wild, while his best friend the lion enjoys being ""spoiled"" by the workers of the zoo. Open Season had a different setting, but the exact same ideas. Boog was being kept as a pet, and was being again ""spoiled"" by his owner and loved it. Along came Elliot, and gets him into trouble which makes him end up in the wild forest. Just about the same idea as Madagascar. Then they end up in some kind of war against the hunter or so, which is just the same idea as Over the Hedge, as well as ant bully. If the writers of Dreamworks are lacking ideas maybe they should slow down on their animations about animals.I still want to congratulate the writers on funny jokes, and say that without Ashton and Martin this movie would have been much worse than it actually is."
77,Open Season,10,9 October 2006,Oscar WORTHY,"I have seen this film. I have also seen the Godfather. This film was faaaaar better than The Godfather. I can't believe how ignorant you people are! You are ruining it's chances of being in the top 250 movies of all time. The graphics were impeccable, the voice talent was amazing, Props to Mr. Kutcher, the dialouge was some of the best and more natural dialouge that I have ever seen on the big screen. And it had plenty of well placed fart jokes. Usually, fart jokes are really over done, and can sound cheezy, but these were very naturalistic. I appreciated that. Props to Mr. Kutcher. On the other hand... The Godfather is a slow, boring, and horribly shot movie. the acting is...Meh.... and the editing is God awful. The movies only saving grace is the guns and the gun sound effects. Those were top notch. So, as I said, put ""Over the Hedge"" in the top 250 films of all time. Because whether you like it or not, it's gonna win some Oscars."
78,Open Season,7,30 September 2006,interesting,"this movie looks really interesting with its different elements in it of a group of animals. That are having a ball; I heard a lot of things about this movie being good, but you will have to go to the theatre and see this for yourself. There is bear in this movie unless I am wrong, which feeds into the plot of the film. There are a lot of other animals in it as well that have celebrity voices so take this into account when you hear the characters. Just like the voices you hear in the movie Curious George, same kind of concept. This is an excellent family film by far and something that even Lizzie Maguire and her friends can enjoy."
79,Open Season,5,24 December 2006,A clich√©d mish-mash of previous animated films,"Open Season is a clich√©d animated film about a bear named Boog, who is a pet to a female hunter. One day, an annoying deer by the name of Elliot comes into Boog's life and the two of them cause havoc in the city at night.Boog is then sent to the wilderness where he and his new sidekick have to adjust to their new life. Worst of all, Boog has no clue whatsoever of how to survive in wildlife.Sound familiar? Try Shrek and Madagascar and nearly every other talking animal flick out there.The only good thing about Open Season is the amazing CGI animation by Sony Pictures. This is their first attempt at a CGI animated film. They were successful with their animation but their script was filled with flaws.For one thing, it tried too hard to be like Shrek. The relationship between Boog and Elliot is reminiscent to the one between Shrek and Donkey.There have been way too many movies with talking animals in the past two years: Madagascar, The Wild, Ice Age 2, Over the Hedge, the Ant Bully and then we still have Barnyard, Flushed Away and Happy Feet, although Happy Feet actually looks quite entertaining.I think it is enough with the talking animal genre. Maybe animators should come up with a new idea, like aliens or more human related films as seen in Monster House.Talking animals are getting boring. But it is not going to end because from next year more animal talking movies are coming including: Ratatouille, Bee Movie, Cat Tale, Kung Fu Panda, American Dog, and Madagascar 2. And worst of all, if Open Season makes more than 85 million, another Open Season will be made! Seriously, this film was made for kids under 10. It may have its crude moments and sometimes funny lines but only children 10 and under could really appreciate this."
80,Open Season,4,2 February 2007,It's Craptastic!,"If you liked ""Shark Tale"", you'll love this abomination. Pretty much written by committee, this movie takes no chances when telling the same clich√©d ""buddy"" story... only this time, it's set in the woods during hunting season! A few chuckles, but otherwise bereft of any real humour or wit. Might keep the kids entertained, but a real snoozer for adults.Main voices are provided by Ashton Kutcher and Martin Lawrence (at least it's not Will Smith!), so this should tell you something of the mentality that produced this picture. Not quite as bad as the aforementioned ""Shark Tale"", but certainly nowhere near the quality that you've come to expect from studios such as Pixar."
81,Open Season,3,11 January 2007,"Boring, no humor found","The animation and graphics are very nice in this movie. The characters look funny, the artists dealing with the graphics did a great job. Very good soundtrack, also. And that was all. The game was more entertaining, and I usually don't like this kind of games. The story and the lines were just plain boring. I could't find any jokes in this movie. (In Barnyard I did find a joke (one).)The characters deserved a better script. This is my opinion. They tried to let all the funny part on the animation and on the situations they face, on their accent (scotish and french accent should be funny) and on music. Recommended for children under 12."
82,Open Season,3,2 December 2006,not what I was expecting..,"After getting free tickets to the premiere of 'Open Season', I was expecting to see a great animated film, like Shrek and Monster's Inc. I ended up coming out disappointed. If you're taking your 5/6 year old kids, they'll probably like it. About half way through the movie I was expecting it to have a twist or something but my friend and I were pretty much bored through the whole movie. It's definitely not a family movie, and I suggest to keep it to the under 10s. Overall, I'm pretty glad the tickets were free. Watch something a little more worthwhile, but that's just my opinion. If you're not so much into comedy, then it's OK. Not hilarious, but cute... .... ... ... ... ... ... .... ..... ."
83,Open Season,4,27 October 2006,A friendly grizzly just wants to find home.,"An interesting and funny animated comedy that really doesn't measure up to a slew of the most recent movies of this same type. A 900-pound domesticated grizzly named Boog(Martin Lawrence)(voice)is taken and let go high in the woods by his caretaker Beth(Debra Messing)(voice). It happens to be three days before the opening day of hunting season; and one hunter, Shaw(Gary Sinise)(voice), in particular wants to make a trophy of Boog. The emotional grizzly has a new partner, Elliot(Ashton Kutcher)(voice), who is hard to shake. The two have to survive open season in order to get back to Boog's garage home. Typical prepubescent potty humor; the small amount of adult humor slips by most kids. Other stars lending their voices are: Jane Krakowski, Billy Connolly, Gordon Tootoosis and Georgia Engel."
84,Open Season,6,30 November 2015,The Bear Necessity.,"Open Season (2006): Dir: Roger Allers, Jill Culton / Voices: Martin Lawrence, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Debra Messing, Billy Connolly: Although often funny, here is an example of a film that forgets its target audience. It is the dawn of new things as Boog, a bear that performs, frees mule deer Elliott from the clutches of hunter Shaw. Simple setup leads to both animals released into the wild and dealing with hunting season, which leads to a corny retaliation. Structure works because animal personalities shine. Director Roger Allers is joined by Jill Culton and both are backed by detailed animation. Boog is voiced by Martin Lawrence as a grizzly bear with a life of his own. He lived a life of luxury in Ranger Beth's garage but once free in the wild, he is unable to fend for himself. He is voiced by Martin Lawrence, with Ashton Kutcher stealing much of the film as Elliott, the one-horned mule deer. Gary Sinise voices hunter Shaw in what amounts to a cardboard character clich√© that never seems to elevate. Debra Messing as Beth is another case of lazy character placement. As an owner of Boog she had potential, but she gets reduced to an after thought. Billy Connolly voices a gray squirrel and that is amongst the several animals that appear and are better seen on Animal Planet. Theme regards friendship although certain species by nature do not collaborate regardless what season is open. Score: 6 / 10"
85,Open Season,5,14 November 2015,Nice try but no,When you think about Open Season you either love it or hate it there is no in between on it.I first watch the movie when it came to TV and looking back on it I have to say the film just has a mix of awe and disgustWhile it does offer some watchable moments most of the film just feels like it's not right to be a family movie let alone one for adults to watch.The first complain I have is the animation I mean what have I been looking at? because it sure wasn't animation because most of the character models look unrealistic and down right ugly I mean I have seen much better animationThe voice acting is pretty good which is one of the few things I say was good about this film Humor in this film often feels funny some had the gross comedy which really ruin the movie for me there are some funny bits but the gross comedy just destroy the film While it feature a creative story it just don't feel like a winnerI give Open Season an 5 out of 10
86,Open Season,2,21 January 2015,Not For Children,"This movie is really not for children, unless you want your 5 year old to ask you what a certain profane word means. I had to keep playing it over to make sure I wasn't hearing it wrong. I surely wouldn't let a child watch this. I know some of the new cartoon movies get a little raw but this is ridiculous. It is rated PG, but so is ""Shrek""and I don't recall anything that offensive. I gave it 2 stars because I don't care for movies that take the cartoon medium which was originally intended for children and inject profanity and things that parents would like to keep their children from seeing and hearing. At least I'm hoping that most parents would like to do this. It's a shame because without the profanity, I would have given it a much better score."

88,Open Season,10,29 October 2011,What's a Shaw?,Open Season is not one of the best animated films ever but it still stands out as a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and the people who were in charge knew what they were doing. The story boards all seem to fit together wonderfully like a puzzle should. Open Season is a film that goes astray and dares to be different from the rest.Boog is a cuddly Grizzly Bear raised by his owner Beth who rescued him as a cub. While Beth and Boog go into town one day they run into a nasty hunter named Shaw. Shaw has a deer on his truck that he claims to have shot but he instead ran poor Elliot over. Elliot is set free by Boog and Shaw is angered. Later on Elliot finds Boog and tells him to bust out of his home and come with him but Boog is happy in his home. Elliot lures him outside with Woo-Hoo chocolate bars and takes him out for a night on the town. Boog is unfortunately caught causing havoc at a local gas station and is brought back home. While Beth is performing her and Boog's next show Elliot shows up saying he is being threatened by Shaw and Boog is not happy with what has happened the night before and tries to get rid of Elliot. Shaw unfortunately almost ruins the show and Beth is forced to tranquilize Boog before he gets hurt. Beth is then told that she should let Boog be in the wild. She does not want to let him go but she does so unwillingly. Boog is out in the woods by himself; or is he?Open Season doesn't try to amaze with flashy animation but the story is good enough to keep it interesting.Perhaps the worst thing going for Open Season is that it seems to portray hunters as bad and that they don't follow the regulations. I am personally not a fan of hunting but not everyone who hunts is a poacher. There are some decent hunters out there who follow the rules.Open Season is enjoyable for everyone. Pace is great and doesn't slow down.
89,Open Season,6,26 November 2010,"A watchable Sony Pictures Animation feature, but also somewhat of a bland one","Sony Pictures Animation, a CGI film production company, has now produced several movies, but I never saw any of them until earlier this month, when I finally watched 2007's ""Surf's Up"". I thought that was a very good animated family feature, and decided that afterwards, I would watch ""Open Season"", another Sony Pictures Animation production which was released the year before, and has animals as the main characters, not unlike the penguin surfing movie that followed. I knew this one was less popular than its successor, so I didn't think it would be as good, but didn't think it would be too bad, either. With these expectations, I wasn't in for any big surprises, pleasant or unpleasant, as I found this 2006 release to be a mixed blessing.Boog is a grizzly bear who lives happily as a domesticated animal in the town of Timberline, living in the garage of a park ranger named Beth, who takes care of him. He also gets to entertain people at a nature show. However, hunting season is about to begin, and a fanatical hunter named Shaw is up to no good! He has a mule deer named Elliot tied to his truck and missing an antler, and this deer begs Boog to help him escape. Boog does so, but after this, Elliot won't leave him alone! After the deer disrupts one of the domesticated bear's performances and sends him into a frenzy, the two animals are both shot with a tranquilizer gun by Beth, and then taken to a place in the wild where they will be safe from hunters during open season. When Boog wakes up, he finds that the life he knows is missing, and starts to try and make his way back to Timberline with Elliot. The tame bear lacks outdoor skills, which will unfortunately be a problem on this trek, as the two of them meet various animals of the forest! When I watched ""Surf's Up"", I occasionally found that the backgrounds looked primitive for a modern-day CGI film, but in ""Open Season"", this is a far more consistent issue. The characters are animated perfectly, but the backgrounds don't tend to go so well with them. Like ""Shrek"" and ""Ice Age"", this film involves a big creature who saves a smaller creature from harm, but then the smaller creature keeps following the big one around and annoying him. Unfortunately, this certainly isn't as funny here as it is in the other two films. The humour in this 2006 anthropomorphic animal movie can be fairly funny, including even most of the occasional toilet humour I guess, but nothing gave me very hard laughs. Shaw, voiced by Gary Sinise, is a rather bland and stale antagonist, even though they got a good actor to provide his voice. Fortunately, in addition to at least mildly amusing humour in places, this film also has some excitement to prevent it from being consistently boring. However, the major flaws still show.After watching ""Surf's Up"" this month, I soon watched ""Happy Feet"", another computer-animated penguin film which came out the year before the Sony Pictures Animation one. Both of those appear to be more popular than this computer-animated forest wildlife film, released the same year as the first of the two penguin films, and produced by the same company that gave us the second. However, even though ""Open Season"" is from the same company as ""Surf's Up"", I think it's about the same in quality as ""Happy Feet"", even if many would say that the 2006 Kingdom Feature Productions production is much better than this Sony Pictures Animation effort from the same year. For CGI fans, I don't think ""Open Season"" is that bad a film to check out, but I certainly wouldn't expect it to be the most entertaining, original, or visually impressive film of its kind, or else I think you will likely end up severely disappointed."
90,Open Season,7,23 November 2010,Fun movie,"I will admit Open Season isn't outstanding, but it was likable and fun. It is too short however, there are some predictable parts in the story and it occasionally feels too rushed. That said, it looks wonderful, with some lovely backgrounds and colours and the character designs are agreeable. The soundtrack is cool, the script has its funny moments with some of the more adult humour decently done and enough wit to satisfy anybody and the characters are likable especially Grizzly. Also the voice acting is surprisingly good, I was surprised at some of the choices(ie. Billy Connolly) of those to do the voices but all breathed life more than adequately to these fun characters. Overall I liked it, it was flawed yes but it was fun, that's all that matters at the end of the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
91,Open Season,5,16 November 2010,Open Season,"I saw pictures and clips of this computer animated cartoon movie and thought it was going to be an easy to like, so when I got the opportunity I had a look. Basically 900 pound brown grizzly bear Boog (Martin Lawrence) has been domesticated by his carer, park ranger Beth (Debra Messing), and become a star attraction on stage. One day he saves the life of one-antlered mule deer Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) from the truck bonnet of hunting fanatic Shaw (Gary Sinise), and he is annoyed by his new ""friend"". It is after a trip to a supermarket and a misunderstanding during a stage show that Beth is convinced Boog has become like a wild bear again, and sees no choice but to release him into the wild, on the verge of Open Season. With his perfect world taken away from him, Boog is now determined to get back to Beth, and it seems Elliot might be the only one who can help him do that. Along the way it is obvious that Boog has no idea to be a wild bear, with problems like eating and pooing in the woods, but at least he and Elliot are developing a strong bond. Shaw meanwhile is of course getting ready to go hunting for the two animals, with a variety of weapons, and is convinced that animals are getting too close to humans. Eventually after some of the forest animals dismissing them and not being able to help them, Elliot is captured and when it looks like Boog has a way to go home, he can't help but feel the need to help his friend. In the end, all the forest animals fight off the hunters and defeat Shaw, and Boog decides with Beth's agreement that he belongs in the woods, with his friend Elliot. Also starring Billy Connolly as squirrel McSquizzy, Jon Favreau as beaver Reilly, Family Guy's Patrick Warburton as mule deer Ian and 30 Rock's Jane Krakowski as mule deer Giselle. The animation isn't quite up to the scratch of Pixar, but the good casting, the shadow part and wild animal jokes and other laughs besides are fun, it is a alright animated comedy adventure. Worth watching!"
92,Open Season,9,28 May 2010,Just a fun flick,"I got a lot of enjoyment out of watching Open Season, getting a lot of much-needed laughs. Likewise, with people all too often thinking of themselves being the most superior beings on earth, it was refreshing to see animals get the upper hand for once! There are stereotypes in this movie, from redneck hunters and Scottish accented battle-happy squirrels. While others may complain about them, I thought they made the movie all the more funnier.I would recommend this movie to just about anyone who is in need of a laugh and can appreciate visual eye candy as well. I thought The animation is cute, and the backgrounds and water were well done."
93,Open Season,8,18 January 2010,nothing i can say bad about it,"Okay i liked it. It Guns and violins but the bit that let me Carita's in had no back story with let me down i have washed number 2 but it was crap this one was the best one if the made a 3 make share there are no dogs s wattled it down okay but the rest of it is okay. This movie was one of the funnest comdeys i have every seen and the rabbits were Fuji'd have to agree with the critics on this one. When you release so many CGI movies with talking animals, there is a point at which mediocrity becomes common place. Open Season is no exception.It seems to me that a lot of these movies released this past year revolve around this basic formula. 1) A plot involving talking animals. 2) Hire celebrities to do the voice acting (need at least one comedian). 3) Have a main character and an annoying obnoxious sidekick. 4) Have some simple plot in which the main characters are on a journey and have to reach from point A to point B.When watching Open Season, I couldn't help but notice the parallels to Shrek. Boog (the bear) = Shrek, and Elliot (the deer) = Donkey. Need voice actors? Easy, let's hire two comedians (Mike Myers & Eddie Murphy vs Martin Lawrence & Ashton Kutcher). Plot? Well, let's just make them stranded somewhere and they have to reach from point A to point B. In this case, from the forest to Boog's old home. Of course, I could make the same case with Finding Nemo (comedians Albert Brooks & Ellen DeGeneres, main character and sidekick, travel from point A to point B plot).Now don't get me wrong, I love Shrek and Finding Nemo. The problem is that when you have two great movies like these released previously, you can't help but notice how much Open Season recycles from previous movies. Open Season lacks any emotional charm or comedic originality. Another problem I had is that a lot of the jokes are based on clich√©s and stereotypes (Scottish squirrels? Male deers = high school jocks? Ducks = French resistance? Female skunks = black women?).If there's any redeeming value in this film, it would be the fact that I watched it in IMAX 3D. It looks amazing. Wearing the 3D glasses, I could see each individual patch of fur on Boog's back and the characters literally came out from the screen.Is this movie good for the kids? Yes. It had some laughs in it and it does bring about a moral message about the preservation of wildlife. It's a good way to kill and hour and a half. But don't expect to see anything new or original in this film.nay"
94,Open Season,6,28 May 2008,Unoriginal and not for children,"I agree with the critics: this movie has nothing original. It feels like most ideas and characters are borrowed from other movies - even some scenes. It is not particularly funny either. I would also like to add that this is NOT a movie for children: I thought it was a rather sad story, the main character being chased, left alone, betrayed, lied to, etc. throughout the whole movie.I am giving g2 points for the movie and 10 for the main character and his teddy bear who are very touching. That brings us to an average of 6 points :)See Cars instead."
95,Open Season,9,20 September 2007,Sony's Inspired Answer to Disney's Chicken Little and Brother Bear...Better Than Both!,"First of all, Martin Lawrence, while great when carried by a good supporting cast, does not at first seem to belong in this production. His speech patterns are very off-putting - so off-putting as to render Boog the bear nigh unlovable. It takes some time before Lawrence actually ""becomes"" the bear. However, after he (or is it the audience who...) achieves some level of comfort, he really settles well into the role of Boog, allowing the viewers to form an attachment to the character. It happens somewhere near the midpoint of the film.This work bears some highly entertaining elements (I LOVE what they've done to the rabbits! Call me a sadistic thing, if you will!) through to a surprisingly satisfying ending where Boog achieves self-discovery and Elliot finally has to accept his fate - he's an animal, he lives in the woods. The things the animals do to establish their safety zone are ingeniously creative. We laughed SO HARD.All in all? We had a blast watching this, can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray, and watch it very often. It's great fun for all ages, although there are abandonment issues raised herein, of which parents should be aware.It rates a 9.3/10 from...the Fiend :."
96,Open Season,9,19 February 2007,Laughed out loud,"I watched this movie Saturday night with my 4 year old nephew. The 2 of us laughed out loud so many times during this movie. I thought it was very funny and had a good moral to the story as far as friendship and growing up go. The graphics on it were really amazing, I felt like I was actually in the forest with all the animals. And the river scene was really done well.I think this movie was much better than Chicken Little and some others I've seen in the past. Any movie that make a 4 year old and a 43 year old laugh at the same things must be doing something right.Would def. recommend it."
97,Open Season,5,18 February 2007,A Pleasant Diversion,"My initial reaction after watching Open Season was, well, it's no Finding Nemo or Lion King.But then, of course, it's not trying to be. Open Season is more like a screwball buddy comedy, and on those terms it succeeds just fine. While having nothing against them, I've never been a particular fan of either Martin Lawrence or Ashton Kutcher, but in this film they fit their roles just fine: Lawrence as the domesticated grizzly Boog and Kutcher as his wisecracking sidekick deer, Elliott. Gary Sinise is satisfactorily sinister as the hunter, Shaw, and Billy Connolly positively steals the show as the warmongering squirrel, McSquizzy.From a technical standpoint, this computer animated film is beautiful, but, of course, they all are nowadays. I've always been a sucker for the traditional hand-drawn animation, but today's CGI films are certainly impressive in their own right. Open Season certainly stands on its own in this regard, but really it all comes down to story. Open Season is fun, funny and lighthearted. It's not high art, but it's good for a few laughs--or many. Ultimately, it won't stand with the ranks of the greatest animated films of all time, but it's good fun nonetheless. Rating: 7/10."
98,Open Season,,6 February 2007,"Bought Widescreen DVD, but it's Fullscreen","I purchased the widescreen special edition from a Target store in San Jose, California. When played, the movie is shown in fullscreen format. This is not a two sided disc, so I'm not putting the movie in the wrong way. Today I took the movie back to a Target store in Fremont and exchanged it. The new movie is also playing in fullscreen format. Has anyone else had this problem? I don't want to spend a lot of time exchanging this movie only to have it be another fullscreen edition. I even asked the return desk at Target if they could play the movie before I took it home, but they didn't have a TV and DVD player in the return section. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
99,Open Season,,30 September 2006,"Entertaining, but full of clich√©s","Braved the kiddies to see 'Open Season' last night, the first completely computer-generated motion picture to be created by Sony Pictures Animation (SPA). The basic storyline is as clich√© as you can get: a typical fish out of water story. Boorg (voiced by Martin Lawrence), the loving bear who was rescued by a ranger and raised basically like a pet dog, has gotten too big and is now released into the wild during *gasp* Open Season, which is the time when the humans come into the forest to hunt the animals. Boorg must now typically adapt to his surroundings, including using the bathroom outside (which is hilarious), finding food, among other things.No fish out of water story would be complete without a side-kick helping the character adapt. This time its the lovable and funny Elliot (voiced by Ashton Kutcher), a down-on-his-luck deer who has been kicked out of his herd and is being hunted by The Big Bad Hunter. Elliot just wants some friends, and wants Boorg to be his friend. The whole time I couldn't help thinking that the character of Elliot was a direct rip-off of the Donkey from Shrek. However, Donkey and Shrek are themselves a rip-off of every buddy-film of all time.So Boorg adapts, makes some great new friends, including the cute-as-a-button porcupine (my favorite character), and generally learns to the ways of the forest. However misfortune drops Boorg and his new buddies into prime hunting ground the exact day of Open Season, and the hunters are going to get them! What is a giant grizzly going to do about this problem? I'm guessing that you can figure it out.Overall, the film was entertaining. The kiddies just loved it, however the movie basically fell prey to lots of animated clich√©s that have been done before, and better. The supporting characters are hilarious, but perhaps a tad underdeveloped. Honestly, the movies' best lines and jokes were in the previews that I've seen many times. I hate when that happens! My main complaint about the film was the pacing of the story. The story itself left something to be desired, because it was very predictable and filled with clich√©s. However, something was off in the end. The film started out pretty good, building up to a giant climax in which the animals fight back against the humans. However, in the third act, the movie sputters and ends too fast. I kept thinking that there was going to be another battle, another fight, another something, however I was wrong. For all the build-up, it was a disappointing end, almost like it was too easy. The end needed some tweaking, that's for sure.What about the animation? In general it was pretty damn impressive. Boorg the bear was done very well, especially with his fur, which looked completely realistic. When you don't notice the fur and it becomes part of the character, that is when you know that you've done a good job. Again, the supporting cast were adorably cute and well done, especially the porcupine. The color palette and general scenery fit the story well, all deliberately thought out to give the audience a Tex Avery cartoon feel. For me, the most impressive scene or sequence in the film was one in which the animals are in water (yes another animated movie that features water). I'm always impressed with water, because I've attempted it myself, and it ain't easy. However in 'Open Season' it looked just beautiful, and it was flawless. I really felt like I was white water rafting! It was amazing.Overall, while entertaining, 'Open Season' is not even close to the Pixars of the animated world. The story was weak and utilized too many predictable clich√©s. Unfortunately, 'Open Season' has fell victim to the current over-saturated animation market in which studios attempt to quickly release lower quality movies in order to maximize profits. However, studios forget the main element that guarantees a hit: THE STORY!! A movie cannot work if the story isn't developed correctly. 'Open Season' could have been a solid movie if the script was rewritten. Nevertheless, it's entertaining enough, the animation is of course stellar, and it will definitely entertain the kiddies. I just wish the story would have been more thought out.:::www.animationchick.com:::"
