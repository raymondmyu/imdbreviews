0,Oliver & Company,10,14 May 2002,I absolutely love this movie!,"Oliver and Company is probably the least appreciated Disney movie ever, and yet it is excellent. I have loved it since I was very very young. I had a giant poster from its original release, and I would sing along to ""Why Should I Worry?"" and ""Streets of Gold"" while jumping around on top of couches, pretending I was Dodger and Rita. That's how ""into"" the movie I was. And I wasn't alone. My friends memorized the soundtrack, too, and we would persistently sing the songs in school. I guess there is just something very appealing about dogs getting around the city by jumping around on top of cars! And when we ran the sprinklers, I would wash my feet in them like Dodger-singing, of course. Oliver and Company is really, really good. It has superb voice talent and animation. Yeah, Tito's ear tear does switch from left to right at one point, but I would NEVER have noticed that...anyway, the story is not weak at all. It is unusual, granted, but then it's a weird twist on Oliver Twist. Most people love this movie. A few have bashed it for petty little reasons. Overall, there's nothing not to like. The music is outstanding. The character design is great. My favorites are Rita and Georgette. They're both very different but they're both very pretty. And they can sing, too. If you look at the backgrounds, at one point you can see dogs from other movies. During ""Why Should I Worry?"" there are Peg (she found a home!), Jock, and Trusty from Lady and the Tramp, and dalmatian who resembles Pongo. There are a lot of cute dogs in this movie who only appear for a second..like the two in the convertible during the WSIW reprise that Dodger and Tito gawk at until Rita pulls Dodge away. Sykes is one of the baddest bad guy ever-- He's got a scary car and scary dogs. This movie is funny, the chase scene exciting. Recommended."
1,Oliver & Company,9,13 July 2003,A truly touching and hilarious adaptation of Oliver Twist,"We've seen a musical version of Oliver, even an animated series, but an animated musical with a cast of dogs and kitten called Oliver set in New York, you'd think it would be a disaster.  But, thanks to Disney magic, this film is a classic filled with songs that are never forgotten as well as that wonderful combination of comedy and family drama.When a homeless kitten comes across a street-wise dog with a gift for song and stealing hot dogs, little Oliver finds himself the member of an exclusive gang of thieving dogs.  But before he even executes his first crime, he is discovered by a lonely little girl in need of a friend.  Chaos soon ensues as Jenny and Oliver get caught up in a kidnapping by the classic evil villain.It's a fun filled romp to be enjoyed by one and all over and over again."
2,Oliver & Company,10,1 September 2005,I love this movie!!!,"OK, I've seen this movie for the first time when I was 6 years old... This movie was actually made in 1988, the year I was born I haven't seen it in 11 years, and now I'm 17 I love this movie even more then I did before!The songs are lovely, and the story is really heartwarming!! The dutch version of this movie is just as funny as the English is! My favorite character is Dodger, because he's the ""cool street dog"" and Oliver is just cute!!I know I'm a real Disney freak and this movie really belongs to one of my favorites!!!"

4,Oliver & Company,7,2 January 2007,"OLIVER AND COMPANY (George Scribner, 1988) ***","Curiously endearing Disney animated feature inspired by ""Oliver Twist"", transposing the Dickensian favorite fairly successfully to a modern-day New York setting - with the villainous Bill Sykes as a mobster (flanked by a couple of vicious mastiffs). Stylistically, it lies somewhere between LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) and the adult-oriented films of Ralph Bakshi (without the sex and violence, naturally); as such, it stands oddly alongside the studio's usual fare from this rather lame era - and its vitality can now be seen to have foreshadowed the renaissance in quality (and critical appraisal) which they witnessed soon after, beginning with THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989). The anthropomorphic characters (which generally swamp the humans - Fagin is very much a good guy here, if still pitiful) are quite nicely fitted to class stereotypes: hence, we get a Hispanic chihauha (with an eye for the ladies) and a posh bulldog, among others, while Dodger is basically an updated version of Tramp and Oliver himself a cute but very brave kitten. The familiar and involved plot is all but jettisoned (especially in its second half) in favor of boisterous action and character comedy, with a bouncy score and rapid pace to match. In the end, it proved surprisingly good - and, at just 74 minutes, short enough not to overstay its welcome."
5,Oliver & Company,7,19 April 2012,The rhythm of the city...,"This movie has an unmistakable 1980s vibe that gives it a certain charm. Viewers familiar with ""Oliver Twist"" will find it interesting how Dickens's story is adapted around dogs and their owners in modern-day New York City.Billy Joel impresses as the voice of Dodger, a mutt with New York attitude. He's joined in the cast by Cheech Marin, Bette Midler, and Dom DeLuise (as a derelict Fagin).The best character, in my mind, is the city itself. This is definitely a New York City movie, tapping into the city's personality and capturing many of the landmarks in the animation.The movie has a visual aesthetic that is not quite like the style of other Disney films, which is kind of cool. There's some great character animation, such as with the imposing villain Sykes (Robert Loggia). CGI framework is used effectively throughout the film to animate cars and things.OLIVER & COMPANY is definitely a product of its time: the late 1980s. The movie is dated by the clothing worn by the humans, the models of the cars, the music (smooth and synthesizery, with the main title song sung by Huey Lewis), the gritty urban look, and even the character designs (see the hot dog vendor or the hairspray-loving canine Rita).In a superficial way, OLIVER & COMPANY reminds me of THE RESCUERS. Both have a unique aesthetic ""feel"" that strays from the classic Disney style and seems to capture the sensibilities of the times. OLIVER is as quintessentially 1988 as THE RESCUERS is 1977. (Both films also portray contemporary New York City, involve animals helping a cute little girl, and explore some dark and emotional territory.) OLIVER & COMPANY is dated, but gloriously so.The next animated film released by Disney would be THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989), which launched the company's 1990s renaissance of timeless masterpieces, shaped by Alan Menken's Broadway-influenced musical direction. It's interesting to see the quaint, contemporary style of OLIVER, knowing that Disney would soon go off in a different direction.With no nostalgic ties to this film, I can say that it's a decent flick, although it wouldn't crack even my top 20 Disney movies. Love the NYC stuff. Joel's ""Why Should I Worry?"" is a musical highlight. The story has a surprising emotional impact and the climax is both dark and exciting."
6,Oliver & Company,10,9 July 2004,A childhood classic,"I just read the previous comment about this being a bad movie and that kind of indirectly hurt my feelings. It's just a nice little movie Disney made for pure entertainment and yes, it is directed toward children. It wasn't intended to be catered toward an adult audience. I also can't see how people can criticize such a nice little movie by picking on the animation and Disney's ""incapabilities."" Disney is awesome and can do whatever they want in a feature. Maybe they wanted to portray it the way they did. Besides, the focus of the movie is the story. And based on that, it's a touching tale. This will always be one of my favorite childhood movies and no criticism from other drippy movie reviewers will ever make me see it any differently."
7,Oliver & Company,10,16 April 2006,I Love this movie,"I think this is one of the greatest Disney films ever, yet it does not get much credit. I mean films like, Toy Story, Cinderella, etc, can be seen often on TV. But I've never seen Oliver and Company on TV, have you? I am 13 and originally viewed it at 6. I loved it then and love it more now! I must have watched it about 100,000,000 times!!!! And I got the soundtrack and am playing now as we speak. My fave character is Dodger, the streetwise, quick talking mutt. I used to jump about on my sofa pretending to be him jumping form car to car. Hey? What's cooler than a dog getting around by standing on a car? I always sing-a-long and I am always being told to be quiet as I am singing sooooo loud my parents can't hear the TV!!!! The songs are all stuck in my head with super-strong superglue! I especially like Why Should I worry and Streets of Gold. Dodger and Rita are so cool. I really love this movie and recommend it!!!!!!!"
8,Oliver & Company,9,16 May 2013,This movie is so underrated,"This probably one of the most underrated animated films ever made. I mean, even when it isn't at the same level than masterpieces like ""The Lion King"", in my opinion it certainly deserves much more love and recognition from the viewers.""Oliver & Company"" not only has great animation, but also has a great cast of very likable characters which are more than enough to make this movie a highly enjoyable experience from beginning to end. The songs were quite catchy too.In many ways, this had some of the best ingredients of the classic Disney formula, and yet, the audience doesn't seem to like this as much as other Disney films that came later (Like ""The Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", and, of course, ""The Lion King"") Personally, I think it had all the ingredients to be a nice and entertaining film for the whole family.8.5/10"
9,Oliver & Company,8,8 November 2006,"A fun ""twist"" on the classic Oliver story","I know it sounds weird because this movie was made when I was a child, you'd think I would've seen it at an earlier age. But I never did and my friend had the movie, I was curious and wondering why I never had the chance to see it. But I'm glad that I just got to see this movie, it was so much fun and I just missed the old time animation. It had great music by the awesome Billy Joel and the animals were just so adorable.Basically, Oliver is an orphan kitten the big city of New York and meets a smooth street smart dog, Dodger. When Oliver follows Dodger to his layer of other dogs who are led by a homeless man, Fagin, they decide to keep Oliver. But when Oliver is learning the street smarts, a little girl sees him and takes him home where he gets a nice loving place to stay, not to mention extremely wealthy. But the guys want him back and kidnap him to pay back the mean Mr. Sykes.I thought this was a great introduction of Charles Dicken's immortal classic for the kids. Not to mention that it was clever and witty, the music is memorable and there are some very funny moments that both kids and adults could get a kick out of. Believe me, this movie is good fun, but I'm still trying to find out why I didn't see it sooner.8/10"
10,Oliver & Company,10,20 July 2006,Very touching Disney classic about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart,"OLIVER & COMPANY, in my opinion, is a very touching Disney classic about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart. I really loved the things that Oliver (voice of Joey Lawrence) and Jenny (voice of Natalie Gregory) did together. If I were Jenny, I'd care for Oliver myself. I would even do the same kinds of things that they did together. I inititally wanted to cry when nobody wanted him. The music was good, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. My favorite song was ""Why Should I Worry?"" In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it."
11,Oliver & Company,6,21 April 2014,Oliver & Company,"I had seen the video trailer for this Disney cartoon movie many times, and as time went by I had found out more bits and pieces about it, such as the voice cast and premise, but it is odd I never watched it as a child, I wasn't going to miss my opportunity when it came. Basically it is the famous Charles Dickens story of Oliver Twist, with a twist, cats and dogs, and only a few humans, play the central roles, the plot is a little altered but pretty much the same, and it is set in modern day 1980's New York City. Little orphaned kitten Oliver (Joseph 'Joey' Lawrence) is the only one of a litter not to be taken by passers by, and winds up alone in the Big Apple, but after being tricked to assisting a laid back streetwise Jack Russell Terrier dog named Dodger (Billy Joel) steal a string of sausages from a hot dog stand Oliver is taken in by the dog's gang. The Dodger is part of a small gang of dog pickpockets, and their leader is human pickpocket Fagin (Dom DeLuise), the other dogs friends are Tito the Chihuahua (Richard 'Cheech' Marin), Einstein the Great Dane (Richard Mulligan), Rita the Saluki (Sheryl Lee Ralph) and Francis the Bulldog (Roscoe Lee Browne). The kitten joins the gang, they are selling shoddy good and stealing money and valuable stuff so that Fagin can pay back ruthless shipyard agent and loan shark Sykes (Robert Loggia), during one particular trip however Oliver gets caught in a limousine by it's passenger, little girl Jenny Foxworth (Natalie Gregory), and butler Winston (William Glover). Jenny's rich parents are away travelling the world, so she is allowed to adopt the lonely kitten, but his presence enrages and caused jealousy from family pompous and pampered poodle Georgette (Bette Midler), until Dodger and the gang eventually find them, and take him from the house. Oliver explains he was happy to be treated kindly and have a real home, Dodger feels disheartened and lets him leave, but Fagin hears the kitten has been taken in by someone rich, he comes up with the idea to ransom him so that his owner will pay a large amount for his return, he tells this plan to Sykes as well. Jenny finds the ransom note and follows the instructions, taking Georgette with her, Fagin realises the owner is an innocent little girl and his conscience takes over, but as he gives her kitten back freely Sykes comes out of the shadows and kidnaps the girl to ransom her, Dodger and the gang chase after the villain, until Sykes is defeated by a train collision on the Brooklyn Bridge. In the end Oliver is reunited happily with Jenny, she celebrates her birthday with the animals, Fagin and Winston, the butler tells the girl the news that her parents are returning home from Rome the following day, Oliver chooses to stay in his new home, but promises to stay in touch with Dodger and the rest of the gang. Also starring Taurean Blacque as Roscoe and Carl Weintraub as Desoto. Joel is cool as the singing dog who knows all the tricks of the trade, Midler is great singing and being the spoilt but hard to resist bitch, but for me the best wisecracks and best inimitable performance was from Cheech, his brash tones and urban dialogue made his character the most fun. As for the film itself, the story is told as well as you would expect for a revamping of a classic, and most of the songs are catchy and snappy enough, I agree compared to other Disney films it doesn't have quite the same charm, but if your looking for a cartoon romp for all the family this is a very likable animated musical comedy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Why Should I Worry?"". Good!"
12,Oliver & Company,6,31 December 2012,"Not strong Disney material, but far from being awful","Oliver & Company isn't a great Disney movie, but if you ask me, it isn't that bad of a movie either. The animation is really good, the colors are bright and cheerful, the atmosphere is upbeat, and there are many cute and pleasant moments scattered throughout the film. What knocks the movie down from being a spot-on hit is that the story is a little uneven and doesn't go into as much detail as it could've gone into; that, and a lot of the characters on the side are just sort of there. But Oliver the kitten is cute and endearing enough, Billy Joel is pretty enjoyable as Dodger, Jenny is a cute little girl, and the characters voiced by Dom DeLuise (Fagin), Cheech Marin (Tito the chihuahua), and Bette Midler (Georgette the poodle) have some funny lines here and there. The songs are also pretty good, with ""Why Should I Worry?"" by Billy Joel and ""Once Upon a Time in New York City"" by Huey Lewis being the best. Overall, Oliver & Company isn't an astounding, remarkable Disney masterpiece that will cater to every audience, but it's fine for children. If you're older, you might like the movie if you typically enjoy any Disney animation as long as it has some fun and charm to it, but if you're a little more discerning/don't have much of a stomach for cuteness, it probably wouldn't be your kind of movie."
13,Oliver & Company,7,29 September 2014,Somewhat memorable animated childhood movie,"This is a dogs and cat's retelling of a classic Charles Dicken's. It's a fun children s' movie that I thought was really heartwarming and fun when I watched it as a kid. Although I didn't get the entirety of the plot. The music isn't anything classic that will last and will be repeated over and over again by Disney fans. But it does get the job done and does fit the environment and story. The plot is about a stray orphaned Kitten that is looking for a home to belong in and fits in with other stray dogs and learns about the streets of New York and how to survive from them. I think they could have done a better job of developing in this area, which could have lead to more of the bonding elements. The animation reminded me of a more fluid animated Saturday morning cartoon show. Overall this is a good children's movie that will somewhat stand out in memories.7.4/10"
14,Oliver & Company,7,6 November 2011,Not Disney's best but what did you expect?,"I've read lots of negative reviews of Oliver and Company and, 10 years ago, I'd have agreed. I didn't like this movie when I was a kid. The story was confusing and I really didn't understand it completely. I watched it again at age 21 and, after a, well okay, kind of weak beginning I began to dread having to sit through it all. But I was surprised to find myself really interested in the story and following it completely as the movie unfolded.I don't think this movie is as good for kids as Disney's usual fare because the story is a little confusing and could go over their heads. But it's still a good and solid effort on Disney's part. I enjoy the music and the characters are very entertaining. The actors sound like they're having a really good time recording the voices too.Is this a masterpiece? Well, no. But it deserves a lot more credit. It's fun and family friendly and it is certainly entertaining enough for adults too. I'm going to give it a 7/10 because it's not perfect but it's still good."
15,Oliver & Company,6,27 September 2010,One of the least appreciated Disney cartoons. With a reason...,"The 27th animated Disney ""classic"" isn't worthy of the word ""classic"". I can see why many people don't like this. I am not particularly fond of it myself.The film takes place in the present day of its release (the year of 1988). It is one of the most simplistic Disney animated films when it comes to artwork, quality, attention to detail, drawings, plot and (in many cases) characters. The backgrounds and artwork are very poor for Disney's standards.'Oliver & Company' is one of the weakest old Disney cartoons, but still far better than most Disney's cinema of nowadays. On the other hand, when it comes to old Disney films, it's very easy to find much better. My impression on this movie is even more harmed considering it's based on Charles Dickens's acclaimed novel 'Oliver Twist'. I don't know how good or bad is the 1968 film 'Oliver!', which I never watched but I know it's based on Charles Dickens's famous novel.Back to 'Oliver & Company' (which I am reviewing), it has some good things too. For example, the music. ""Once Upon a Time in New York City"" (by Huey Lewis) is a touching song and is played in a touching part of the movie. ""Why Should I Worry?"" (by Billy Joel) is pretty cool. Jenny's song is pretty.What else is good in this film? Well, it has some likable characters, although I can't say the same on most of them. Starting with the likable characters, Dodger is super cool. He is, as he says, New York's coolest quadruped. Obviously, he is not perfect, but who is? Anyway, he is fun, carefree and charismatic. Billy Joel is the voice of Dodger (both speaking and singing) and he is awesome in both. Oliver is naturally cute, innocent and adorable. Jenny is a very nice rich little girl. She is humble and doesn't have the arrogance characteristic of many rich people. I think that Jenny was somehow inspired on Penny from 'The Rescuers'. I wouldn't be surprised. Even their names are very similar.As for the other characters. Winston isn't a character that I dislike, but he is nothing special. Fagin is a good guy, however so clown-like that he is irritating (although, at the same time, we feel bad for him). Clearly more annoying than Fagin are Tito and Georgette. Tito is so rude and obnoxious and, to make thing worse, he never shuts up - although it's hilarious when he gets electrocuted in that limousine and says the line «Yeah. Well, it's hard to watch anything when you're getting barbecued, man!». As for Georgette, I can't stand her. She is extremely rude, obnoxious, selfish, spoiled, stupid, sarcastic, unbelievably snobbish and arrogant, not to mention annoyingly vain and proud of herself. Good grief!Francis, the bulldog that strongly dislikes to be called Frank and Frankie (as Tito often does to provoke him), isn't a bad chap but he's nothing special either. Sykes is one of the most sinister Disney villains ever. He is like a mafia guy and a real nutcase. He is terrible when it comes to people he lends money but don't return his money. He threats with creepy attitudes and phrases such as «People get hurt» or «Somebody might get hurt». Plus, you can tell he is the type of guy who kills if somebody knocks on his door by mistake. For example, there is a scene which the dogs disguise themselves as a pizza boy and Sykes is ready to attack with a gun and menacingly wondering «Where are those dogs?», which makes me believe he'd do the same if a real pizza boy knocked on his door by mistake. He makes horrifying threats to Jenny such as «Don't cry, little girl. They only eat when I tell them to» (referring to his vicious Dobermans Roscoe and DeSoto). When he snaps his fingers, this is an order for his vicious Dobermans to attack and eat. There is one terrifying scene which he snaps his fingers and they viciously attack Dodger and leave him unconscious. He drives like a maniac, chases after Fagin though New York subway, wrecking his car... he does many scary things. My final note: a 6 out of 10."
16,Oliver & Company,6,16 July 2009,"Good, Standard Disney Stuff","In most respects, this is a pretty standard piece of Disney animation, enjoyable to watch with a lot of fun songs, but not quite reaching the heights of Disney's more famous animated features. Based loosely on Charles Dickens' story ""Oliver Twist"" it features the usual assortment of good and evil characters - both human and animal, with Oliver, a cute little kitten, being the requisite cuddly and adorable one of the bunch. Essentially, little Oliver needs a home, which he finds first with a bunch of vagabond dogs who are partnered with a vagabond human, and then with a little girl from a rich family who brings him into her home. Given the type of movie this is, there are perhaps a few too many twists and turns in the story for a child to be able to follow. There's a lot of lessons about the nature of friendship and family to be found here, and, unlike a lot of more recent animated tales, nothing that would serve as a caution about letting your child watch it. Oliver offers the viewer an enjoyable experience - not Disney's best, perhaps, but still fun. 6/10"
17,Oliver & Company,9,30 May 2013,Probably the most underrated Disney film of the 1980s,"I didn't hear about this film until around 1996/1997 when it was heavily publicised in the UK, which made me think it initially came out at around that time. When I found out that this film originally came out in 1988, I was surprised but wasn't disappointed since my sister and I loved this film as children and as young women (I'm 26 and my sister's 22) we still love it to this day.Although the animation is linear and quite flat (which is present in other Disney films such as 'The Jungle Book' and 'The Rescuers'), the lip-sync on the human and animal characters is detailed as well as their facial expressions, despite the absence of tears falling from Jenny's eyes when she confronts Fagin about Oliver being 'kidnapped.' The most positive aspects of this film are its swift pace (particularly during the climax where Sykes and his Dobermans chase Fagin, Jenny and the other animals down the subway track); the talented and relatively well-known voice cast including Billy Joel (Dodger), Bette Midler (Georgette) and Cheech Marin (Tito) of 'Cheech and Chong' fame; the background designs (especially the bird's-eye views of New York City and Central Park); and the songs (the ever-so-catchy 'Why Should I Worry?' and the sweet 'Good Company' are standouts). Jenny and Oliver are sweet while Georgette is beautiful and Tito is comical, although I would like to have seen Jenny reunite with her parents and show them Oliver.As well as the 1968 musical 'Oliver!' this is one of my favourite adaptations of the classic Charles Dickens novel and also one of the most underrated films I've ever seen. 9/10."
18,Oliver & Company,9,5 April 2012,Better than people think,"Oliver and Company gets a lot of unnecessary criticism as critics do not seem to like this film much. For me the story is not the best it could be but the animation and music in the film is very good, especially 'Why should I worry?' which is my favourite Disney song. Like the Hunchback of Notre Dame, I don't think this was an easy film to adapt but I think Disney did well with a vibrant film with good animation and music and characters that are all appealing and funny. If it were not for the story being slightly lacking I would give the film 10/10 but it is my regret that I must give it 9/10. Still my personal favourite Disney film though. :)"
19,Oliver & Company,10,20 March 2012,Best Movie for anyone,This is the best movie ever I know this cause when I was just a little kid I watched everyday on the week son I knew the lines at a young age and yes I loved Dodger but everyone was awesome in that movie.A kitten hanging out with dogs now that is touching real life there I have seen kittens hang out it dogs all the time when I film my versions of the movie but nothing comes close to this master piece.Not only is it great movie but it also plucks the heart strings if you can me drift real right there.It beats out Godzilla for my all time favorite movie I mean BILLY JOEL was in it the single greatest artist playing the single greatest character not even in the big name movie do u get this kind of show this movie deserved more awards like best picture of all time none can compare.
20,Oliver & Company,8,8 March 2012,A delightful and underrated Disney classic,"Truth be told, Oliver & Company isn't one of Walt Disney Studio's most compelling titles, but it's still plenty of fun. It has a wonderful soundtrack featuring great talents such as Billy Joel, Bette Midler, Huey Lewis, and Ruth Pointer. All of the musical numbers in the film are well-staged, nicely animated, and have fun tunes to carry them along. ""Why Should I Worry?"", Billy Joel's song and the film's show-stopper of sorts, is the most popular. While I like that song a lot, my personal favorites are ""Once Upon a Time in New York City"", the opening song sung by Huey Lewis, and ""Perfect Isn't Easy"", Bette Milder's song to go along with the character she voices: Georgette, a spoiled poodle.The story itself isn't quite as strong as it could've been (which is why I award the movie an eight as opposed to a nine or a ten), but it still offers a lot of sweet, charming, heart-filled, and suspenseful moments. The characters also aren't *all* the way there, but they're still good as they are, and their voice actors do their jobs well. Each character has traits that make them appealing, even if they aren't the strongest characters in the Disney canon.I'll end by saying that Oliver & Company is a very enjoyable Disney feature. Children will certainly be entertained by it, especially if they love cats, dogs, and fun musical numbers. Adults can enjoy it too if they appreciate the worlds of animation and Disney enough. Because of the film's level of fun and charm, I give it an eight. If the story and characters had been even better, I would've given it a nine or a ten."
21,Oliver & Company,10,3 February 2012,One of the best animated movies,"I remember watching this movie when i was a little girl i loved it (L) it was unique, fun, and the soundtrack was great me and my sister would always sing ""why should i worry"" every timeSo, i don't know why i wanted to start watching my childhood movies again so i started with ""oliver and company"". And i still love it Disney should make more movies like this Great soundtrack, fun, with a moral in the ending I give 10 to this movie cause it made me want to watch it over and over againPeople compare this movie with ""All dogs go to heaven"" in my opinion I liked ""Oliver and company"" better because of the soundtrack and it had more action The characters are funny, especially the little chihuahuaKids of this generation should watch this kind of movies instead I bet they will love it"
22,Oliver & Company,10,27 December 2011,The Twist Put In The Title Of Its Original Source.,"At the time, I didn't know that this film is supposed to be loosely based on Oliver Twist, but this take on it puts the twist in Oliver Twist. And I remembered that this is another Disney animated flick that didn't see the light of day on VHS (or any other home media, for that matter) for almost a decade. I didn't see the original theatrical release, but I caught the re- release. And I loved it. I love how this is one of the few movies of which the studio/company made it semi-adaptation/semi-original. One of the things I love about it is the song ""Why Should I Worry"", among others featured in this, which is one of my favorite Disney tunes. I find the set-up of this version taking place in then modern times, which made up the same era that this was made (late 1980s) interesting, possibly, simply because it was interesting that something different was done. There were even some real world ads featured on billboards that made it into this and were referenced. And the fact that the main cast are dogs and a kitten.The Oliver in this remake is a tabby kitten who is the last in a box of abandoned kittens to be eventually adopted. The first dog he meets is the streetwise Dodger, who attempts to lose him after dropping their brief partnership. Oliver follows him to an old barge, which is his home, as well as the other dogs (Francis, Einstein, Rita and Tito) and their owner (Fagin)'s home. Oliver only stays with them briefly, as Fagin is deep in debt to a loan shark dealer named Sykes, who warns him he has three days to come up with the money he owes him or else face the consequences. When Fagin and the pets head out the next day, Oliver is soon discovered by a girl named Jenny, who wants to adopt him and he's taken into her home. After the other dogs come to what they thought was his aid, Oliver misses her and his new home, and wants to go back there. Dodger bitterly lets him do as he requests but before Oliver can return, Fagin finds him and decides to use him as ransom, as a desperate attempt to make the amount of money he needs to pay off Sykes. But once he finds out that it's Jenny who's looking for the tabby with her poodle, Georgette, he decides to do the right thing and give him back to her. Suddenly, there's trouble when Sykes arrives and kidnaps Jenny after learning that she comes from a wealthy family. So it's up to the dogs to come to her salvation. How will they ever manage to succeed in the rescue and will they come through for her?Not only did I see this, but I had the Disney read-along and the book adaptation as part of the Disney Classics Series by Mouse Works Books. Again, what I love about this are the aforementioned reasons above. This is one of the Disney features that are the closest to doing something fully original (other than Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Lilo & Stitch, Brother Bear and Home On The Range). The first song included in this that I mentioned is my favorite is one reason why all who haven't seen it should check it out when they can. That's a great part of the soundtrack and the best."
23,Oliver & Company,4,30 June 2015,One of Disney's weakest animated films,"I have nostalgic memory of watching the original trailer for ""Oliver and Company"" a lot as it was on the British VHS of ""Sleeping Beauty"", one of the first videocassettes we ever had. This made me interested in the film as a child, even though I only got to see it many years later. As an adult, however, ""Oliver and Company"" seems a bit of an enigma. Made during a period when the whole Disney company was back on the up after a slump in the early to mid 80s, it's surprisingly one of Disney's weakest animated films from the main animation division, greatly paling in comparison to the likes of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""The Little Mermaid"". Reimagining the story of ""Oliver Twist"" with cats and dogs is a bit of a far-fetched idea, and taking a long, rambling Victorian epic and turning it into a fun-filled adventure with cuddly cats and dogs in New York doesn't really work. The characters are cloying, and the desperate urge to be contemporary results in a film that ends up being truly dated. Some of the songs are fine enough, while others are embarrassing (especially Bette Midler's number ""Perfect Isn't Easy"", penned by Barry Manilow). Equally, the film feels very disjointed in tone. It starts off as a comical urban romp but in the last act suddenly turns into a dark story of kidnapping child characters. There may be a happy ending, but overall, the turn of events just seems inappropriate even for a film studio renowned for specialising in mild peril for children. It might be worth a watch if you're a serious Disney aficionado and want to watch all 50 plus animated features, but for anyone else, I wouldn't recommend it."
24,Oliver & Company,2,25 February 2006,"Cute, adorable kitten. Bad film","I was left disappointed after watching this film in the cinema when I was nine/ten years of age. I had bugged my parents to see it, as I loved anything that had to do with cats. The cartoon Oliver the kitten looked adorable, orange, with soft, large eyes. The hero could not have been cuter. The sidekick dog Dodger could not have looked more cooler. Even the little girl shared my name, so he film could not appear anymore better to me until I actually saw it. The film was dull and unengaging. The story seemed pointless. Some of the characters were just too annoying, and as a nine or ten-year-old, I was actually bored. I think my mother even resented taking us to watch the film because she was bored too. This was one of the first times that I actually felt disappointed in my childhood. Cute, adorable kitten. Bad film."
25,Oliver & Company,10,29 August 2006,Jumpin' back on the bandwagon again...,"Disney began to get back on its feet in 1988 (well, theatrically) with ""Oliver and Company,"" an animated feature. It's a great movie because it's a dog movie (and a cat one, too, unfortunately), and I love dogs!!!!! Here, a bunch of cool pets go on adventures around New York City; one amazing part is near the end with the huge Olds on the subway tracks, where it got hit by an oncoming train on the Brooklyn Bridge, putting the bad guy away!!!!! And so, the pets live happily ever after. The end!I've seen the re-release in theaters in 1996, and I thought that this was a great film!!!!! The ending scene sure was my favorite scene, indeed.""Oliver and Company"" is one of those films that put Disney back on top again! I recommend this to any pet lovers!10/10"
26,Oliver & Company,,24 January 2006,My brief review of the film,"Loosely based on 'Oliver Twist', some of the elements are cleverly adapted, but overall it is a bit of a bumpy ride with the rock music soundtrack jarring at times. Although the story is a bit slow to getting work, the film nevertheless seems to find its place after the first half hour. The second half of the film has a number of amusing moments and the songs improve in appropriateness towards the end. The animation is not at all exciting throughout, and it this factor more than anything else that has caused the film to gain a bad reputation. With a degree of silliness, since the film is aimed a children's level, it is not really a great film, and it certainly does not rank among Disney's best animated works. However, I would be inclined to label it as a good film. While some of the changes to the original Dickens story are painful, others are very amusing, and ultimately the film does the job providing adequate entertainment for a little over an hour."
27,Oliver & Company,10,14 November 2005,My family likes it almost as much as I do,"We actually saw this film on the big screen as a family. Our children enjoyed it - I think because I enjoyed it so much. (We own two copies of the VHS). I liked it a lot then and still like it - One of my top ten movies. That my wife and I have seen Billy Joel in Concert in Philly had a lot to do with it. Also, we lived on the East Coast for five years and could identify with the characters. The music is corny enough to be ""cool."" I read somewhere the quote attributed to Cheech Marin something to the effect that ""now I can take my kids to one of my movies."" Dom Delouise is a great character voice (and a fine actor, of course). The casting of Bette Midler as the show dog Poodle was a stroke of genius. The gang of canines each have their own lovable personality - contrasted to the ""bad"" Dobermans who do the bidding of the evil Sykes. Who can resist the story of an orphan being rescued by a rich kid whose world-traveling parents make her a defacto orphan. The ""refined"" butler shows his crude side and befriends the ruffian Fagin. It's a fun family movie - just over an hour. It can take a downer kind of day and brighten it beyond compare."
28,Oliver & Company,,9 April 2004,The Grittiest animated Disney movie yet?,"In this late 80s/early 90s animated Disney super animal adaptation of the Oliver Twist story, Oliver (Joey Lawrence) is a kitten in need of hearth, home, family and friends. Although he is initially mocked and patronized by the jaunty dog known as Dodger (Billy Joel), he is later accepted into Dodger's ring of lovable scoundrel thief dogs, who include the typical New Yorker dogs, a Hispanic dog, an older dog, and a Shakespearean dog. Just as Oliver is about to learn the way of the pick pocket, he is snatched up by an adorable little rich girl named Jenny and she adopts him as her playmate pet while her parents are away and the only one watching her is her butler. Jenny's resident dog, Georgette, a well bred prize winner, doesn't take well to the little stray cat being in her home. Then Fagan, Dodger's master, who was already in deep trouble with the local gang lord, gets into even worse trouble and it's up to Oliver & Company to save him in what has to be one of the most intense and violent climaxes ever featured in a children's film.
Animation is very much of its time, and so is the music. That doesn't mean you won't like it, because personally I thought this film was quite a mild riot. If you happen upon it, give it a look."
29,Oliver & Company,10,16 September 2014,gasmaskproductionsbooks is insane!,"What is wrong with you man? NONE of your so-called criticisms make ANY sense whatsoever! It's NOT Fago, it's Fagin! Pronounced FAYGIN! NOT pronounced Fag-o! I mean come on already! Were you THAT DESPERATE for something to criticize? So you made up an utter lie? Or are you seriously that stupid? If you're that hard of hearing than watch the movie with captions or subtitles! And how can anyone NOT love the songs in this? The very first song is my absolute favorite song of all time! And then there's this line: ""The frightening scene with the kitten in the box, nearly getting sucked down the storm drain, then waking up on a car tire that's about to squish him. The sausage salesman with the scary face. The big mafia-looking guy chasing the hobo..."" Um, really? That's the best you can come up with? If you REALLY want a scary face why don't you watch the part in Pinocchio when The Coachman says that ""they (the boys) never come back...AS BOYS!"" Now THAT was a scary face. This is nothing. As for the rest, well I mean if the opening events had never happened then how would the plot be set in motion? Yeah he almost drowned, but that's part of the plot? Remember in Finding Nemo, Dory says to Marlin (about him saying he'd never let anything happen to Nemo), ""That's a funny thing to promise. I mean, if you never let anything happen to him, then nothing would ever happen to him."" It's so true. And the tire was the only safe place at the time to sleep under, I mean, the box already was washed down the drain, and he was chased by three rabid dogs. OK, I do have a MINOR nitpick about that part. In the scene right when Oliver sees the three dogs, if you look closely you'll notice one of the dogs only has one eye. What's up with that? Was he born that way, did he lose his other eye, or did the animators simply screw up? I'm not sure. But it's barely even noticeable. The only reason I noticed was because I WAS paying close attention when I watched the Danish with English translations version of the song. After that, I re-watched my Blu-ray copy and looked to see if they had corrected it for the 25th Anniversary but it's still there. By the way, the lyrics to the song are very deep in the European French version. They contain lyrics like ""So Oliver buck up. Go out on the street, don't be afraid. There are people like you, who laugh are who cry. We all have the right, to live and to dream sometimes. There was a time in New City."" The original version's lyrics in that part go ""So Oliver, don't be scared. Though yesterday, no one cared. They're getting your place prepared, where you wanna be. Keep your dream alive, dreamin' is still how the strong survive. Once Upon a Time in New York City."" The second to last line in the original version was also referenced in an episode of Liv and Maddie entitled Moms-a-Rooney. Maddie says at one point in the episode to Karen ""You keep this dream alive!""I'm also working on making my own version of Oliver & Company called Gordy & Company. Here's the cast: Gordy as Oliver, Adult Tod (The Fox and the Hound) as Dodger, Fern Arable (Charlotte's Web) as Jenny, Baloo (The Jungle Book) as Fagin, Dinky the Finch (The Fox and the Hound) as Tito, Trina Vega (Victorious) as Georgette, Shere Khan (The Jungle Book) as Sykes, Boomer the Woodpecker (The Fox and the Hound) as Einstein, Benson the Gumball Machine (Regular Show) as Francis, Vixey (The Fox and the Hound) as Rita, Winston as Himself, Brutus and Nero (The Rescuers) as Roscoe and De Soto, and Old Louie as Himself."
30,Oliver & Company,7,30 November 2007,a good Disney movie,"Here is a nice little Disney film that is perhaps a little bit underrated and perhaps a little bit quick. It's a short movie that is suitable for all members of a family, containing enough peril and frightening images to keep it from being a film for just the little kiddies. And yet it isn't too terrifying or unsuitable for the aforementioned children. ""Oliver & Company"" does rush through pretty quickly. The plot already becomes clear and right to the main point pretty early on in the film. However, it is not without substance or creativity and has some very delightful or in the case of the three villains, dislikable characters. The characters are loosely based off the characters from a Charles Dickens novel called ""Oliver Twist"". I'm not that familiar with it, but I do recognize Dodger as a representation of the Artful Dodger, Sykes from his novel counterpart, and so on and so forth. But based on the one film version of ""Oliver Twist"" I've seen, this film is quite different once you get past a few characters and their similar traits.The characters are all well-realized in terms of both animation and the voice talents put behind them. Oliver, the kitten, was voiced by a child about eight years of age, and is therefore the animated cat is very convincing at being both cute and youthful at the same time. Dodger is the artful, cool guy who knows the way things go and never loses his temper. And there's the rest of his gang who follow his commands and advice. They are all under ownership of a poor man named Fagin who lives in a rickety old boat. Fagin is one the most likable of the characters because of his comic relief and how things never seem to go his way. There was one animation flaw I noticed with this character. Sometimes his nose would be pink, and other times flesh-colored without any indication of it changing colors. There are three villains, a mobster-like guy called Sykes and his two dobermans, Roscoe and Desoto. The actor who voiced Sykes provided a chilling, cold, and almost purring kind of voice that made Sykes seem really sadistic. He's not the most frightening Disney villain, probably because of his limited screen time and somewhat underdevelopment. I did like the dobermans and thought they were very well-done as villainous characters because they had little dialogue. It made them less sympathetic since they mostly just growled, barked, and snarled rather than talking. And yet, they had enough lines to make them more like the rest of the characters.Since I am not the biggest fan of Disney movies, I can't really make a big long review of this, since I'm just recently beginning to start watching these old, animated shows again. But I'll just summarize this review up by saying that ""Oliver & Company"" is, for me anyway, an okay animated family movie. It's not the best I've seen, not the worst, but worthy of seven stars out of ten."
31,Oliver & Company,,1 September 2002,Written by my 5 year old daughter,"My favourite part is when Oliver & Jenny sing You & Me Together.One day in New York City a little kitten got lost.  All his brothers and sisters were sold and he was left alone.  He wandered about in the city and he saw some paws, it was Dodger the dog.  He showed some more of the city to him and then he showed him his friends.  Dodger and his friends taught the kitten how to steal money and the kitten got stuck in the car and a girl called Jenny picked the kitten up and held him all the way back  home and called him Oliver.  Dodger and his friends rescued Oliver and took him back to the place where Dodger showed him his friends.  They sent a ransom note to Jenny and she brought her piggy bank and then Fagin kidnapped Jenny.  Dodger and his friends and Oliver rescued Jenny and Oliver went to live with Jenny. Written by Bethany."
32,Oliver & Company,8,14 October 2017,"Underrated. Not a master-piece, but underrated.","I still find Oliver & Co. enjoyable and cute even though it withers when compared to what followed. To be honest, the setting of a Charles Dickens story, which showcases some literature's's most gruesome characters, in the most groovy 80's environment imaginable is a little silly. Aside from that, it has made the gang of stray dogs and their owner, Fagin, a fun and enjoyable part of the New York setting. The interplay between the poodle Georgette and Tito the Chihuahua was hilarious. That aspect of the movie is also well rounded off in the end of the movie. The songs are actually pretty good. I often catch myself humming them after watching the movie. ""Why Should I Worry"" is ridiculously catchy! If you don't hum it for hours after hearing it, something is wrong with you. The songs ""You And Me Together"" and ""Once Upon A Time In New York City"" are sweet and sincere and deserve more attention.The villain is among the weaker villains and did disappoint. Bill Sykes is known for being one of Dickens' most evil personas in his novels, and he is surprisingly forgettable in this depiction. His canine sidekicks are more memorable. But he gets an awesome chase scene at the climax of the movie. All in all, I think Oliver & Co. is a great movie mostly for kids, but deserves more attention. I think it is often overlooked like many of the 80's Disney movies."
33,Oliver & Company,10,15 March 2017,I Love this Movie,"First....I love this Movie Because his name is Oliver is my name too.The voice acting was amazing and showed us what probley goes through a dog and cat mind is and i really love that.Second...Jenny is the Sweetest Girl I have ever seen she would do any thing to find her cat and I mean it.Third....The Poodle Ilove poodles I have poodle and I just love it lol.Sincerely,Oliver Wady"
34,Oliver & Company,,15 January 2016,One  more great family movie from the masters,"Disney has always been good at providing well-made family entertainment high quality. Oliver & Company is no exception. A fun fast paced adventure which boasts a good voice cast Oliver & Company is the kind of great family entertainment we come to expect from the mouse-house. A modern day retelling of Oliver Twist with an all canine cast this is a fun and exciting movie. Being Disney it works for all ages. The animation is good , the songs are good and the characters are lovable and fun. I highly recommend that any parent show this film to their children. No one does it like Disney ! you will not regret it. It's a movie that the whole family will enjoy. Because when it comes to Disney (especially before 2000)you you can guarantee that a lot of care and skill went into the film. Like the man who started the company Disney always gives (With the exception of those dreadful Disney Channel Original Movies and series and Disney XD original series)a hundred percent !"
35,Oliver & Company,8,28 March 2015,A good movie,I don't know when I first saw this movie as kid but it made an impression. Now watching it as an adult I still like it. The songs are amazing and the story while a little short on plot is still very enjoyable.You see the love that the dogs have for each other and for their person. Dodger is a protective and loyal friend that cares for everyone. One of my favorite moments is when Dodger is settling-in for the night and Oliver comes over and curls up next to him. You get in that moment the whole center of this movie.The gang to varying degrees understand why Oliver wants to go with Jenny and not stay on the street. They all have needs and wants that are sometimes at odds with each other. Rita seems to be the most understanding. I think she wishes that she had that chance that is being given to Oliver.When Dodger looses his bandanna in the last fight you see him age and realize that this is all he will know and that he is happy. Yet somehow you feel sad for Dodger and his gang knowing that they are going back to the streets. Even though they have love they are living on the edge.Basically give this movie a chance and decide for your self.
36,Oliver & Company,7,4 March 2015,A hip and cool Disney movie!,"This is an adventurous Disney movie, his 27th full-length animated feature film, that is based on the story of Oliver Twist. Instead of humans, animals are the main characters and each are quite memorable and funny to watch. The adorable kitten Oliver wants to be adopted, but gets himself mixed in with a gang of street-smart dogs, led by the cool-acting Dodger, who try to protect their humble owner Fagin from being victimized by the debt-collecting Sykes.It's one adventurous ride from start to finish, full of energy, bright animation and popular music (I especially enjoyed the hip ""Why Should I Worry,"" sung by Billy Joel, and the serene ""Good Company,"" sung by Myhanh Tran). The colorful characters and the wild adventures will appeal to a wide audience of adults and children.I did, however, thought the movie went too fast, which left little room for the characters to establish more chemistry and bonding, like the friendship between Oliver and Dodger, and the friendship between Oliver and the girl Jenny. In addition, I thought Georgette, the vain poodle, was hilarious and should have been utilized more.But, overall, it's a fun Disney movie! Grade B-"
37,Oliver & Company,8,28 February 2015,Back to 1988,"To be a teen again back in the 1980's.VHS, Breakdance and on.Also this movie a modern New York City version of Oliver Twist.It's literary a twist with talking dogs.Some of the dogs are Dodger with the perfect voice of Billy Joel.The dogs owner are Fagin, and this time the villain drives a big black car.To mention the few merchandises way back then there was posters and read a long books.The movie got a well deserved Golden Globe nomination.An applause to the all star cast, the detailed background animation and the music by J.A.C. Redford.Don't except Pirates of Caribbean this is just some light entertainment with some nice action sequences at times.8/10"
38,Oliver & Company,6,8 June 2013,"""Why should I worry?"".","Franticly searching round for movies in my possession from 1988 that I could watch for a poll that was being held on IMDb's Classic Film board for the best films of 1988,I was thrilled to stumble upon a Disney title that I have been interested in watching since my childhood,which led to me excitingly getting ready to see Disney's very distinctive sounding take on Charles Dickens classic tale.The plot:Finding himself to be the only kitten left in a ""for sale box"" that has been left unattended,Oliver decides to break out of the box,and begin a search round the streets of New York for any crumbs of food.Feeling hopeful that his starvation is about to end when he notices a human chef cooking a pile of juicy hot dogs,Oliver's hopes are quickly dashed,when the chef kicks Oliver to the side of the road.Accepting defeat from the chef,Oliver turns his back from the hot dog's,puts his tail between his legs,and begins his long search for food again.Stooped in his tracks,Oliver is met by the unexpected sight of a dog called Dodger,who due to seeing how desperate Oliver is for food,kindly offers to team up,and use his street smarts to help Oliver steal some hot dogs from the chef.Cheeful about getting an offer of help for the first time in his life,Oliver quickly agrees to Dodger's plans.Outwitting the chef from all angles,Oliver and Dodger grab as many hot dogs as they can hold,and quickly set off to a near by dark alleyway,where they will both be able to enjoy their winnings in hiding.Feeling wonderful about finally having some food to eat,and also being part of a team,Oliver is caught completely by surprise,when Dodger tells him that he is keeping the hot dogs all for himself,and that the only reason he worked with Oliver,was to give ""the kid"" a street education.Determinded to get a piece of the hot dogs,Oliver decides to carefully follow Dodger,who Oliver soon discovers is actually a member of a back ally street gang.View on the film:Made at a key time in the studio's history,where Disney was just starting to leave its fiscal ""dark age"" behind,the 23 writer-written screenplay (not including Dickens name!) struggles on making the relationship between Oliver,Dodger's gang and the human's not feel like it has been created on a assembly line,with the trim 70 minute running time not allowing the writer's to give each of the character's their moment to shine,which would have allowed this extremely distinctive adaptation to really sparkle.Whilst the screenplay of the movie sadly fails to become that energetic,director George Scribner, (who was originally meant to co- direct the film with Peter Young,who sadly died age 37 just before filming was to begin) gives the film a stylish appearance,with the smooth character animation being contrasted by an eye catching,oil painted ""rotten apple"" New York City backdrop,and some early use of well handled CGI effects.Along with Scribner's directing,the voice cast also make sure to give the movie a loud yelp,with the brilliant Billy Joel being an absolute howl as the streetwise dodger,and Joseph Lawrence also giving the movie some much needed heart,as the cute,but never sickly sweet,fur ball Oliver,which leads to Dodger's gang being one that is deeply flawed,but still a great deal of fun to be a part of."
39,Oliver & Company,8,16 December 2011,A funny one for sure,"This was a very interesting Disney classic as it's story was the usual one with a bad guy, yet it was funny at the same time. The cat who was with a pack of dogs, trying to fit in. Ended up at a rich person's house and the little girl there loved him and he ends up having to decide which side to be with. Plus there's the evil guy who's funny and I liked how stereotypical he was. Then there's just the general comical story and jokes.I was impressed with the songs, but felt that near the end the summary and ending was a bit rushed, almost not complete as if it were missing something. We never did get to see the parents of the girl and their reaction, etc.But all in all it was a good movie. 8/10."
40,Oliver & Company,,8 June 2003,Can I say a departure for Disney animation back then?,"When I heard about this film when I was a little kid, I was too little to remember seeing it in the theater, I was only two when I first saw it. I was excpecting a sentimental, cutsie, sweet, cat/dog movie. I never even saw any of the movie until Pocahontas came out, and I rented the Disney's Sing Along Songs Colors of The Wind Volume,where ""Why Should I Worry was on it. I never saw it until I was 11, when I rented it on video. Back then I had a pretty intense interest in that movie, and it lead to a phase of me being dog crazy. now I'm cat crazy, and prefer cats. The music rocks it was like 80's rock and roll. ""Why Should I Worry"",and a lot more so, ""Streets of Gold"" has become a theme song to me, it'uplifting and gives me an optimistic attitude that I ""Make an art out of staying alive"",to make it simpler, it gives me an attitude I can survive trecharous roads, dodge semis, and escape from armed psychos, gangsters etc. when I'm down in the dumps and feel incompetent, and don't think I'll be able to get my Driver's License, and survive the real world. And it gives me a message about surviving spiritual life too.I go on long bike rides where I constantly look to make sure no big vehicles are too close to me, make moves to avoid it, and bride my bike everywhere almost like it's my car, and ""Why Should I Worry"" is like my theme song, ""I may not have a dime, but I got street saviore."" Aside from that, you know how most Disney animated Classics, are usually set during ancient times during the Middle ages or before? Well forget that, and see how the choice of music is hip 80's. The Boss, instead of some sorcerer, or witch. Is a modern day bad guy, a gangster Crime Boss. The villain seems like Robert De Niro in GoodFellas or a Bronx Tale. The film doesn't seem too kiddie-ish, when the characters are a bunch of thieves, changed from humans in Oliver Twist to Dogs, and a hobo, Fagin. Tito the Chihuahua is hilarious, along with him there's the fat bulldog, Francis, Einstein the Great Dane, and Rita the Afghan hound, and the Artful Dodger. The plot maybe somewhat alike a Bronx Tale, with a De Niro-ish figure, and gangsters, and thieves in New York City. I think it's better having a Disney movie set in the 80's New York, the weapons used today are used by the crime Boss, when he kidnaps Jenny, the little girl, after Fagin holds the cat for Ransom.Georgette is good as Jenny's narcissistic Poodle. What I found attractive and not something you'd see in a cartoon often is that a grown- man is babysitting Jenny. Winston, an old guy, while her parents are away."
41,Oliver & Company,2,14 November 2003,Always darkest before dawn,"It's quite interesting that Oliver & Company was Disney's animated feature in 1988, just one year before The Little Mermaid signalled the studio's renaissance. The difference in quality and appeal between these two movies could hardly have been greater. Oliver & Company is based on Charles Dickens' 19th century novel Oliver Twist, and Dickens' plot is actually quite cleverly translated to Manhattan in the 1980's, with the characters reinterpreted as cartoon animals. But even though you might recognize a lot of the story elements from the book, the movie lacks the magic and drama of Dickens' story - and of any truly classic Disney feature, for that matter. The kitten Oliver is a whining, two- dimensional imitation of the enchanting kitties from Aristocats. He is totally devoid of personality and, quite frankly, you don't really care what happens to him. The same could be said of all the other characters, with the possible exception of Bette Midler's poodle-diva Georgette. The songs (written and sung by Billy Joel) are alsouncharacteristically weak for a Disney feature. Oliver & Company is quite possibly Disneys least interesting animated feature to date, albeit with tough competition from Winnie The Pooh and The Fox And The Hound."
42,Oliver & Company,,5 November 2003,Excellent,Oliver and Company i think is a fantastic disney cartoon movie. I never knew that this movie was made in the 1980's this movie was made in 1988. I loved this movie and i would love to see it again. I give this movie 10 out of 10.
43,Oliver & Company,8,9 September 2013,Seriously why the low rating I found this movie to be heartwarming even though its seriously underrated.,"I first purchased this as a present back in 1997(16 years ago)on VHS and to this day I still watch this movie. From the beginning I literally shed an odd tear for the movie's main charcther Oliver(voiced by Joey Lawrence when he was a kid)who is an orphan kitten that was looking for a good home,but nobody wanted him AT ALL. So enter Dodger(voiced by singer Billy Joel)who is a streetwise dog,that looks after Oliver along with his other mutt friends including a irritating dog,a dog that wants to be an actor,a goofy dog and a female dog (who I'm really not kidding here has EYE SHADOW!!). Meanwhile later on in the movie we meet another girl called Jenny who finds Oliver tangled up in wires as Oliver was teaming up with the irritating dog who later has a thing for a poodle(voiced by another singer Bette Midler) that belongs to Jenny.But who will Oliver choose; Dodger the dog and his owner Fagin(voiced by Dom Deluise) and the other mutts or Jenny the sweet and innocent red head that you cannot help but love?Bottom line I loved this movie since I was a child and to this day I still have it on VHS all the time and it never fails to bring a tear in my eye(yes you gotta be a cynical moron not to cry over this movie).The songs were great especially Billy Joel's song Why Should I Worry and the other song In Good Company sung by the little girl Jenny.This movie was witty,cute,sad,entertaining and a feel good movie.For that I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. A 10 is too much as the movie can be a bit silly with the whole talking animals but if your an animal lover and you love 101 Dalmatians,Lady & The Tramp then check it out."
44,Oliver & Company,10,29 March 2008,Excellent Underrated Disney Movie,"Just finish re-watching this movie and I must say I don't regret it. Music is wonderful, we see some of Howard Ashman's work (that would be the seal of the next decade of successes for Disney Animated Films), It really brought me back to the Eighties. So does animation, it's incredible to see how easy is to realize when the movie was made by the techniques used.Characters are very lovely, at the point I swear a few tears in the first scene (I can't help it, I have weakness for homeless animals). Oliver is just too sweet, also liked Georgette a lot, ""Perfect isn't easy"" is really very funny and Bette did an outstanding job. Jokes and gags aren't too worked or original but they will grab a smile for sure.We see some first time, but not less quality, CG in this movie, check out the cars; they look like old ""3d"" computer games... but for the time they were great. Also the structures in the subway sequence.Story shares a lot in common with the Dickens' book with some differences to adapt story in the roles of the characters.In my opinion, the Second Golden Era of Disney should start here, because besides this movie was a success itself, the Little Mermaid (Considered the start for the golden era) wouldn't had the success it had if it wasn't for it's immediate predecessor.A Must for every Disney-liker!!"
45,Oliver & Company,10,25 February 2002,Purr-fect - An under-rated furry classic,"Oliver & Co is a story of loyalty and love. The characters are cute, funny, brave and resourceful. The songs stick in your head especially those by Dodger, Georgette & Rita. It takes the basic elements from Dickens' novel and transforms them into an original, fun filled, animated adventure. The voice talent includes Billy Joel, Dom Deluise & Bette Midler who really bring their characters to life. Oliver joins Figaro, Marie, Toulouse & Berlioz in being one of the most lovable kittens in film history. No animal lover should be without it. 10/10"
46,Oliver & Company,6,13 June 2017,"Not very well written, but it's got a vibe","""Oliver and Company"" doesn't have much in the story department. There's not a lot to these characters beyond trying to guess who's doing their voices, and the subject matter is awfully lightweight.But what it does have is a solid depiction of New York in the '80s. The skyscrapers, the billboards, the grimy feel once you get down to street level . . . throw in some sitcom sax and the city start to really live and breathe.This was a movie I was interested in (but didn't catch) as a kid, and I think I would've liked it a lot better then.6/10"
47,Oliver & Company,7,2 May 2016,"Despite the critic shaming, I enjoyed this","Oliver and Company is another obscure Disney movie, that, like The Great Mouse Detective before it, can be considered a musical. As the second film in my personal timeline's Disney Renaissance (and officially the final film in Disney's Dark Age), there is actually a lot to see here. I appreciated the characters and songs, and the story was executed well despite seeming very familiar. There are some thrilling and tragic moments (especially at the end), which is my style, but other than that, it was just good. The acting could have been a bit better (Cheech Marin could have sounded a little less stereotypical), but I took the most points off for the animation. While passable for Disney (it beats any of their direct-to-video films), it seems more like a very-well polished TV movie than something for a feature film. I don't know if Disney was trying a new style on their budget, but only a select few moments were ones where the animation effects were, in my opinion, cool. Despite its major flaws, I still enjoyed it and I can recommend it to anyone reading this."
48,Oliver & Company,7,10 December 2010,An Underrated Classic with a Captivating Contemporary Atmosphere,"After almost never seeing it my whole life, I ended up really liking it! The entrance into the film is so kindling and awakening, we get a majestic view of New York City and then it slowly pans in... at that point, I knew I was going to see a good movie!It's a like Disney version of Oliver Twist with an anthropomorphic mix. On the harsh municipal streets of New York we meet Oliver the kitten (voiced by Joey Lawrence), a very different star in Disney; Oliver soon finds himself on the streets in trouble and alone, but a much unexpected fellow comes to his aid, Dodger the street mongrel. Oliver soon meets the true parental guardian he always wished for, Penny.The characters in general are very fascinating. As I watch a film I can usually get in the movie, and Oliver is no exception. I almost feel like I have to be the surrogate big brother for Oliver, he's an irresistibly adorable orange kitten with those big captivating eyes and chuffy mouth, but has a great sense of dignity too, a kid who can survive the streets of an uncaring society (as we see when he first encounters Dodger). I really like Dodger for some reason, he has that strutting machismo of a rough skinned archetype, but we soon see that he harbors that soft- heart of a big brother for Oliver. Dodger's homeys are a very colorful team of dogs. Tito (Cheech Marin), he's a gag, with his Latino flare and peppy personality he almost gives the will-to-go-on to the other member when they are blue. Francis is the refined one, with a daunting appearance; you'll soon see that he is the gentlemen of the group. Einstein (Richard Mulligan) is the strongman with a heart of gold, but but his role is very small, however we see a hidden leadership within him. Rita (Sheryl Lee Ralph) I really like her; she's like Tina Turner in dog form! She seems to a maternal figure to Oliver and has an underlying superiority over everyone, even Dodger. She's the character you wish to be explained, and yet there is no revelation of her mysterious past. Penny is very charming, and a very determined mind, but sometimes I find her a little bit annoying, but through her hardships I really begin to understand her, no one-on-one parental interaction, and very lonely spare time. Oh yes, then there's Georgette (the one and only Bette Midler), The pampered poodle blue-ribbon winning of Penny's household, Georgette is a definite screen-hogger; she is the most aberrant of all the Oliver characters and harbors no redeeming qualities throughout. She scheming and endearing at the same time. Fagin (Dom DeLuise) is the ""keeper"" of Dodger's gang, even though he's supposed to funny, I can't help but feel sorry for this guy. I guess he represents the vagabond archetype. Sykes is one sick Disney villain; he's very realistic. The Dockyard crime lord wants every under his control and can't stand mistakes, but bestows dubious mercy dripping with poison. Not only is a physical threat to be reckoned with, those Doberman can instantly sic you with the snap of his fingers. His defeat is very unusual for a Disney villain; it makes this light-hearted film dark and interesting.Like all Disney movies, the voice cast can be respectable or astounding, and for the case of Oliver, this is a rather cool voice cast. Lawrence portrayed a very innocent and even desperate soul for Oliver. Joel did one heck of a job for the macho Dodger, with a strange sly accent. Cheech is the fiery soul of Tito, invigoratingly raspy and even overwhelming. Bette Midler did an astounding job on Georgette's song debut, but I almost felt like Midler's others vocal parts were simmered down.George Scribner directs Oliver and he did a very good job and graces Disney wonderfully, but he made the film very simple, and if you single out this film out from Disney (where is joins wonderfully) and into the world of the great movies (anyone say Shaw-shank?) it can be awfully weak and childish. The film however flows at a great place, and the sad or thought provoking scenes are put together with emotion and conciseness.I love how the animation is incredibly urban and contemporary, conveying the flashiness and grittiness of downtown NY. It's like a moving children's book almost throughout (which is a delight). The character design is brimming with soul and life, every one of the animals like a specific human trapped in dog form, the humans are works of art, but sometimes over done. Some action scenes are not to precise, like when Oliver is climbing frantically over the hot dog man, it's very cartoony there as opposed to the rest of the film's child picture-book quality.I can't expect less from Disney to make original numbers. Not only are the songs jive-provoking, but the score is good too, conveying tenseness and emotion. I absolutely love ""Why Should I Worry"" (Dodger's debut song); it fleshes the freedom of the city and freedom of an individual (Dodger namely). ""Street of Gold"" is cool, the theme is the notion of survival, and the virtue of social smartsRuth Pointer is amazing! ""Perfect isn't Easy"" is just good old entertainment, Midler does an amazing job fleshing out that show-tune vanity song. ""Once Upon a Time in New York City"" by Huey Lewis this is a beautiful song, it's like the essence of the film, the city is can be a harsh place and this is one story of one individual, an orphan and his acceptance into a strange and new society.It doesn't standout much, but I like it a lot! It is a herald of those that would come; the transcendent Disney Renaissance of 1990's and in a way deserves to be part of those majestic titles!"
49,Oliver & Company,7,25 October 2010,"Understandably not widely considered to be one of Disney's masterpieces, but still likable enough","This particular Disney animated feature, inspired by Charles Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"", was originally released when I was only two years old, and I never heard of it until around the time of its 1996 re-release. It seemed like a new film at the time, and I guess it was new to the VHS format when I saw it. I didn't know it was originally released in theatres years before then until I looked it up, which I believe was sometime in the past few years. I saw it at least once in the 1990's, when I was around ten years old, but after over a decade without seeing it, I've finally gotten around to doing so. By this time, I knew ""Oliver & Company"" wasn't one of Disney's most popular animated features, but as usual, I thought it was still a good one.A litter of orphaned kittens are purchased on a street in New York City, but sadly, one of them, an orange cat named Oliver, is left behind. This kitten wanders the streets of the city and can't seem to find anyone to interact with until he meets a dog named Dodger. Oliver helps Dodger steal from a hot dog vendor, but the dog then refuses to share the food with him, so the homeless kitten follows the dog back to where he lives. Dodger's home is a barge, where he lives with several other dogs and their poor owner, Fagin. Fagin is in trouble, as he owes a loan shark named Sykes a lot of money, and only has three days to pay it! The next day, Oliver goes with Fagin and his dogs on a mission to try and somehow get enough money for the man to pay off his debt. While they are out on the streets, the kitten is found and adopted by a friendly little girl named Jenny Foxworth, but this may lead to more trouble.This 27th Disney animated feature starts on the streets of New York, showing people buying the kittens. This is not a stunning beginning, but it does get rather moving as we see poor Oliver left behind in the rain. More major characters are introduced along the way, starting with Dodger, voiced by renowned musician Billy Joel. We soon hear him sing, ""Why Should I Worry"", a song I remember from my first viewing of the film. Of all the songs contained in ""Oliver & Company"", that one might stand out the most. After that, the film soon introduces the rest of the dogs that live on the barge and their owner, Fagin. These are generally likable characters, much like Oliver, and so is Jenny, who first appears a little later in the film. The voice acting is also very good, which helps. As one would expect from a Disney film, there's also humour here. Tito, a Chihuahua voiced by Cheech Marin, can be very funny, and he's certainly not the only one. The plot may not be the greatest ever written, but it's enough to hold one's interest. The animation is also pretty good here, with some nice city backgrounds.Unlike many of the other animated Disney movies made during the 20th Century, this one is certainly not considered one of the classics, and that's understandable. There are definitely a number of better ones from the company. However, while ""Oliver & Company"" is nothing TOO special, it's still decent family fare, maybe more for kids, but it still has enough for adult Disney fans. I'm sure quite a few Disney buffs don't like this 1988 release at all, and there are some things which might make it a little different from most of the company's other animations, most notably the songs. These aren't typical Disney musical numbers, and I don't think most of them are among the most memorable, either, but they certainly could be worse. Anyway, while I wouldn't expect this to be one of the best animated movies you've ever seen, it still has my recommendation for those who like this type of film, regardless of age."
50,Oliver & Company,,11 August 2010,"Extremely Dated and It Lacks a Great Story, But It Has Some Qualities","Not-so-spectacular animation, a rather shoddy plot and hardly any character development, ""Oliver & Company"" is a weak link in the Disney canon. It was a big thing when it hit theaters in 1988, but now, it's either a shoddy film or a nostalgic joy (If you loved it as a kid).""Oliver & Company"" takes ""Oliver Twist"" and modernizes it to be more hip for the 80s and for animation-hating teens at the time. Likewise, it was big because of the older crowd. The film is more of a training exercise for the young Disney animators, but fortunately, it is a fun film to watch.Seeing Billy Joel doing a voice in an animated film is priceless, and he sings in it too, and the song is actually good (Well, Disney films always have good songs). The rest of the cast was fine. The dialogue is very 80s-esque, but tolerable. The rest of the soundtrack is 80s pop & rock. It's not bad.Flaws include the plot, screenplay, unexciting animation and the fact that the film is dated. This is why it was a flop on its re-release and its debut on video. The animation is not bad, but it's been-there done-that when you put it next to the older Disney films and even a majority of the newer ones. The sames goes for ""The Great Mouse Detective"", which fortunately had a lot of redeeming qualities. There is one excellent moment in this film, the use of computer animation for a chaotic subway chase sequence. This is probably the best thing about the film, and it shows ambition in Disney animation. This would lead up to stunning use of computer animation in ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"".Otherwise, ""Oliver & Company"" one of Disney's weakest animated features. A 7.7 out of 10."
51,Oliver & Company,5,5 September 2013,Sometimes the movies you see as a child don't hold up so well when you experience them again as an adult,"Sometimes the movies you see as a child don't hold up so well when you experience them again as an adult. ""The Rescuers"" and ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" still carry the same magic they did when I first saw them. I've also discovered a few I didn't see the first time around which now hold a special place in my heart, with ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" immediately coming to mind. Unfortunately, there are also a couple that lose their luster when viewed again through older eyes, like ""The Sword in the Stone."" I'll be adding ""Oliver and Company"" to the last category.A wayward kitten named Oliver spends his days and nights wandering the streets of New York City. While searching for food, he runs into a dog named Dodger who spends his days scrounging up food for his misfit family of stray dogs and assisting their homeless human friend Fagin make ends meet. Just as Oliver joins the canine clan, he is adopted by a girl named Penny. Danger materializes in the form of a pack of Dobermans that Penny's parents. They take a disliking to Oliver and plan to remove the threat to their home any way they can.""Oliver and Company"" is nothing more than a water-downed version of ""Oliver Twist"" that injects the sounds of Billy Joel, Bette Midler, and Broadway musicals together into one intolerable experience. Replace the humans in Charles Dickens' classic novel with animals and you have a recipe for annoyance. It's 74 minutes of sheer pain and agony for parents to endure while their children smile and giggle at the cuteness unfolding on screen.One of the biggest problems with ""Oliver and Company"" is they dumb down the main villain of the book. The character of Fagin from Dickens' novel is a perfect example of evil and cruelty. Disney makes him a sympathetic bumbling bad guy with a good heart in this animated version."
52,Oliver & Company,5,11 September 2011,"Not the worst Disney flick, but far from memorable","Oliver and Company is a film you'll either find completely adorable or horribly bland. I'm not too taken by it, but I'd be a liar to say it wasn't entertaining or cute.The story involves a kitten named Oliver, all alone on the chaotic and ruthless streets of New York City. He meets a street smart dog named Dodger, and is eventually adopted by him and his gang of stray dogs, who live with a clumsy but good-hearted homeless man named Fagin. Fagin's in a tight spot: he owes money to Sykes, a merciless crime boss, and only has three days to rake up the debt or else. While helping Fagin and his new friends to get some money on the streets, Oliver is picked up by Jenny, a wealthy but lonely girl. They become close immediately, and all seems well until Dodger and his gang ""rescue"" him from his new companion. However, this turns out to be a blessing for Fagin, who decides to take advantage of the situation to get money out of it.The animation is so-so. There are a lot of early CG effects which haven't aged well at all, jarring with the rest of the film when they show up. The backgrounds are nice and reminiscent of a children's book illustration, and they really help give the film that necessary urban atmosphere. The music, while not classic status, is pretty good, even if you won't be humming it later.Dodger is easily the most memorable character in the movie. He's cool, has a catchy song (""Why Should I Worry""), has an awesome voice from Billy Joel though not in the ranks of characters like Jiminy Cricket or Ariel, he dominates every scene he's in. The rest of the cast is a bit of a mixed bag. Oliver is cute, but has little personality, making it hard for him to carry the film. The same applies to Jenny, whose only personality trait is her sweetness. The other dogs in Dodger's gang are pretty forgettable too (except for the obnoxious Tito, who I wanted to strangle five seconds after he opened his mouth). Fagin is a little better; you really feel sorry for him and his character animation is entertaining to watch. The villain Sykes is threatening, but, like many of the other characters, he doesn't leave much of an impression once the film ends.Despite my rather low rating, I don't consider Oliver and Company to be a horrible film. I won't deny it has its moments, but overall it's just very average.5/10"
53,Oliver & Company,8,25 February 2009,Bright and breezy animation that is enjoyable at best!,"OK, first things first. I am not sure what Charles Dickens would say if he found his best book ""Oliver Twist"" has inspired an animation. I hate to say this, but surprisingly the project worked quite nicely, if a little predictable and uneven at times. The animation isn't bad at all, actually very clean and smooth mostly, and neither is the story, both of which are the redeeming merits of an enjoyable movie like this one. The characters were also well done in general. My favourite was Georgette, what a genius the casting director was to cast Bette Midler. Jenny and Oliver- who was adorable- were appealing also, but Sikes at times was a bit frightening, and Fagin's part was quite poorly written. Now the script was the letdown, very uneven at times, and unintentionally funny, and this marred the well-told narrative. Some of the characters were uninspiredly written, and Tito was a little hard to understand. On a positive note, I loved the songs, especially ""Why Should I worry?"" which is delightfully catchy. May I also say that Billy Joel did a great job with Dodger, who was one of the better characters. And it has a wonderful contemporary atmosphere. All in all, an enjoyable and well-told film, that was let down by the script. 8/10. Bethany Cox"
54,Oliver & Company,9,8 September 2005,This film is adorable!!!!!,"I love this film its really cute Joey Lawrence was only about 12 when he did this film so he sounds so adorable. Oliver and Company is just basically a Disney adaptation of oliver Twist, but it's set in new york and the main character is a cat! Anyway!! It's still a really good film and doesn't get the recognition that it should!! It's has some really talented actors in it Like Bette Midler and Billy Joel. And there are some really good musical scenes which i always song along to! (Yes I know its a bit sad But i don't care!!) A really enjoyable film that everyone should see!!!So watch this film i am determined to turn this film into a known Disney classic up there with lion king and Aladin!!!!!!"
55,Oliver & Company,10,12 December 2004,This movie rocks because it has Billy Joel in it.,"Oliver and Company is a great modern adaptation of Liver Twist. It's got great songs, and great voice-over actors including Dom Deluise, Joey Lawrence, Cheech Marin and Billy Joel. This movie is a great family movie. he only part I didn't like was the opening. That scene still makes me cry even today, when little Oliver is left all alone. And the song, 'Why should I worry?' will always get stuck in my head. Even now I it's in my head. Honestly, how can anyone hate this movie? It's got humor, adventure, talking animals, everything Disney is famous for. Oh, and for those of you who think this is the worst movie ever, think again: No movie is worse than Mulan."
56,Oliver & Company,1,21 March 2005,Not worth the 72 minutes you'll lose and never get back.,"The people on this site are too kind. This is easily the worst movie Disney made and I am including The Emperor's New Groove in that. I suppose there could be some charm if you are a New Yorker or a big Billy Joel fan, but being neither I found the story to be dull, the songs lackluster and the animation quality reminiscent of a bad after-school special reminding kids to look both ways before crossing the street. As many problems we can lay at Eisner's feet, his turning the studio around from making cartoons like this to LIttle Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast almost makes the last ten years worth it. It's amazing that only a year later every kid was singing Under the Sea when this movie makes you want to stick your head in the sand."
57,Oliver & Company,10,26 August 2016,Absolutely Purr-fect,"This is my favourite Disney film of all time. It still holds up to my childhood enthusiasm. The characters are extra lovable, courageous and funny. The soundtrack is incredible - score and songs. You just can't help singing along. There are famous singers/actors in the voice cast, including Billy Joel and Bette Midler. They bring great energy to their roles. Oliver is the cutest, but is also feisty and is well able to fit in with his new pack. Georgette is a scene stealer with her vanity and jealousy. The gang are devoted to Fagin, Oliver and each other. They are all enjoyable to watch as they demonstrate their ""street savoir faire."" Sykes and the dobermans appear infrequently, but deliver pure menace. The 2D, hand-drawn animation is marvellous and also features some early computer work. Their decision to shut down this department in favour of full CGI is a real shame. The poster still has pride of place on my wall (and I have toys, books, the CD and an intact mug.) I regret that this film has been over-shadowed by the 90's super successes. The opening is breathtaking and heartbreaking. The whole is a delightful journey that never fails to cheer me up. Just purrfect."
58,Oliver & Company,9,12 June 2016,An underrated jewel,"I absolutely enjoy Oliver and Company. It's upsetting that Disney isn't paying it more attention. I get it's not like the book but a kitten as the hero? Jenny Foxworth adopting him? Subway chase? NYC? I'm in! I know not all Disney movies are famous but this era's had a little too much Frozen. This is from a Frozen fan and I feel it's not as hyped up as lots say. Why not revive this one? There's no Oliver and Company merchandise. I can think of several ways to revive it: -Live action remake. -Once upon a Time. -A follow up story(ideally not direct to DVD.) All, in all, I really would like this to get more appreciation! Who's with me?"
59,Oliver & Company,10,17 January 2015,One of the greatest animations,"This movie has one of the greatest animations.Because the movie came out in 1988 and the animation is really cool.It looks kinda real.The story is sad and good.The songs are awesome!so I gave graphics 10/10,story:10/10,Songs:10/10.I watched this when I was a kid and it was brilliant.I watched it recently and I still think its brilliant!I loved the graphics it looks real kinda.Would I recommend this?for under 5:yes..but there some scenes that can frighten them.5-10:yes.10-15:yes.15-20:yes.20-30:yes.30-40:yes.40-60:Yes.60 plus:Yes.If you were born in 1980s:you will absolutely love this film!If you hate it,Then why?There's no reason to hate it at all!"

61,Oliver & Company,7,22 October 2007,A very good movie,"""Oliver & Company"" is about an adorable vagrant kitten called Oliver who gets taken in by a gang of good hearted dogs and their kind hobo owner, Fagin. Oliver is soon taken in by rich girl Jenny and lives the good life, however, Fagin owes money to nasty loan shark Sykes and Jenny is kidnapped by Sykes. The dogs, Oliver and Fagin all set out to get her and it ends in a pretty dark climax. It's a good movie and that's all I can just say about this. It may appeal to boys more than girls but girls will like it nonetheless. It's also a very dark film and may frighten some kids and it deals with adult-ish situations (nothing really sexual though), but still a fun little family flick."
62,Oliver & Company,10,24 August 2004,A Cute Disney Film,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*""Oliver & Company"" is a cute Disney film.  I remember seeing it when it was re-released to theaters in 1996 when I was 9 years old.  I loved it and fell in love with Oliver, he was an adorable kitten.  I also loved the songs in this movie.  My favorite part of the movie is when Jenny sings ""You and Me Together"" to Oliver.  That part of the movie is so cute.  I also liked the part when all the dogs are singing in the city.  That part is very creative.I suggest that all Disney fans should see this movie, cause you'll love it. I give this movie 10/10 stars."
63,Oliver & Company,,26 November 2003,who couldnt love this,"This movie is great from the tear-jerking beginning to the spunky heartfelt end !!!! Its a great comedy the whole family will love over and over again!!! my favorite thing about it though is the songs including my personal favorite ""perfect isn't easy"" that Georgette (Bette Midler) sings. This movie is great fun you have to watch at least twice!this cute kitten Oliver was the outcast of a litter of kittens left on the street with a huge free sign. after no one chooses the little one, he goes off on his own running into a clever mutt named Dogger who con's Oliver into helping him get some hot dogs, then Dogger deserts Oliver not leaving him a single scrap! so angry Oliver follows the new ""friend"" to his home to find a deserted houseboat, a master with debt to a maniac, and a pack of dogs who live the hard life. the new family takes him under their battered wing but in a plot to save their master Oliver is picked up by a lonely little rich girl named Jenny, who has a butler and a stuck up prize winning poodle Georgette (played by my favorite star Bette Midler) to keep her company. his old family still loves him and think he's in danger and immediately bring him back to their humble home Oliver wants to be with jenny but still likes the street life! will Oliver chose the first family with only love to give or the warm hearted jenny and her warm cushy life and what about the maniac mobster who's about to kill the poor burdened master of Dogger and the gang. Who knows check it out!!~sonnie"
64,Oliver & Company,1,18 October 2011,Disney's 80's weakness continues,"As much as I loved Oliver and Company in my youth, and defended it to the death when I found out that it wasn't regarded that well, it breaks my heart now to realize what a lackluster movie this really is. The visuals really drew my attention, seeing as though they were completely awful looking. It is as if the Big Apple had a watercolor explosion. The story still seems more interesting than presented, a New York Oliver Twist with classic Disney animals, but the only redeeming part of it was Billy Joel's Dodger character. Being a lifelong fan of the Piano Man, it's always entertaining to see him enjoy being a dog jumping off cars and singing about the carefree life. The only points I can give for nostalgia is 1 star. 1/10 Truly a disappointment, could have been better."
65,Oliver & Company,5,14 April 2007,"Friendly enough, but a long way from Disney & Co. at their peak...","Animated take on ""Oliver Twist"" from the Disney Studios, marked by an impressive list of star-voices in the cast but hurt overall by fairly colorless songs and unmemorable characters. These adventures of an orphaned kitten and a streetwise dog are not particularly witty--and the cuteness quickly becomes wearing--but very young children should enjoy it (older kids and adults may start squirming after thirty minutes or so). Relies heavily on the panache of the celebrity performers (including Bette Midler, Billy Joel, Robert Loggia, Richard Mulligan and Cheech Marin) to give the scenario some energy, but the vocal hamming is occasionally irritating. The musical numbers, while nothing marvelous, are at least upbeat, and the finale is good, but this is a long way from even ""The Rescuers"". ** from ****"
66,Oliver & Company,1,31 July 2002,The worst animated feature ever.,"Everything about this movie is horrible.  It is too violent for small children, the songs are poorly executed, the animation is sub-par, and it is altogether disjointed throughout.  I don't know how Disney convinced any of the stars to use their voices in this one.  Every part of this movie was painful to watch."
67,Oliver & Company,10,22 December 2007,Why such a low rating like 6.3? This movie is a masterpiece!!!,"I remember when I was young I watched this movie over and over again. I still have the VHS of it and I plan on grabbing it and sticking it in my VCR and watching it. The music, the characters, the city life and basically the great action and marks of love, friendship and family are there! And the great use of CGI animation on almost every vehicle in the metropolitan city. The city is faithful and the song talking about it shows you the ways of new york city and sends its message to oliver, the little orange cat and who is the main character of this wonderful movie.What i don't get is why does the film receive an almost mediocre rating? What is wrong with the film to get such a score like that? I see nothing at all wrong with it. It is another Disney movie with something new to keep you watching and the new things i've seen are CGI and really cool music that really suits the late 80's new york. Come on, now! 10/10 and that's truth. i'd hope to see a Disney movie i like to exceed the godfather on the top 250 list. Lets say The Lion King."
68,Oliver & Company,9,28 April 2007,An old favorite,"If there's one thing I remember about this movie, it's that I really, really liked it... allow me to explain why.First of all, you gotta love the plot: a clever spin on Oliver Twist, with some excellent voice work... to be honest, I'm surprised that this movie is so underrated.Secondly, the music is rather enjoyable too. I found myself humming ""Streets of Gold"" at least two days in a row after seeing this movie again in what seems like 19 years.Most of all, just the overall execution was brilliant; in fact, the only nitpick I have about this movie is that if you've read the Dickens novel, it's a spoiler.Other than that, this is perfect! 9/10"
69,Oliver & Company,10,15 February 2007,This was such a great movie!! I just saw it...,"This was such a great movie!! I just saw it for the first time a little over a week ago and just loved it. I especially loved Oliver because he is so cute, and he reminds me of Simba, my favorite Lion King character. I also loved Tito. One of my favorite parts of this movie is the songs. I like Once Upon a Time in New York City, and Good Company, best. I am planning to learn them on the piano. The opening scene, where Once Upon a Time in New York City plays, makes me cry on the inside. The scene where Jenny sings Good Company is adorable! I am planning to watch every Disney classic possible. I have seen quite a few and loved them all!"
70,Oliver & Company,10,20 January 2007,"Children and Parents will LOVE this one....the music SOARS,","You can't lose watching this one! Purely delightful. Disney at it's BEST! Parents will also be highly entertained. Billy Joel songs and all! Witty and funny. An eyeful and an earful! Bette Midler also shines. A parents chance to ENJOY a kiddie movie. This cartoon movie even has a plot! I was thoroughly delighted, and you'll be too. Many stars contributed their talented voices... Billy Joel, Bette Midler, Robert Loggia, Dom DeLuise, Cheech Marin and Joey Lawrence as the voice of Oliver. Don't pass this one up. It was made in the classical GREAT style of Disney. If only the new Disney movies were as good as this 1988 HIT!"
71,Oliver & Company,10,2 January 2007,Heart Warming,"This movie was a wonderful rendition of how friends can take care of friends. I cried and I laughed throughout. Anyone who has a child should buy and show this movie to their kids. It truly teaches about compassion!Oliver is an adorable kitty with a fate of having been left behind on the streets of New York City. He gets taken in by a funny gang of dogs who ""rescue "" him from the home he desires. Soon, a twist of strange events brings the viewer to the realization that there is true compassion in the world even when it appears untrue.Any New Yprker would agree with the artist's rendition of the city! I will recommend it to all young kids. A true blessing!"
72,Oliver & Company,7,30 October 2006,Another Disney classic....,"Oliver and company is sure to leave you howling with delight. Its great message ,everyone needs love, is sure to get threw to your kids with these unlikely heros. A full squad of dogs and a cute lovable cat even a person or two. Its musical numbers will get children movin to the groovin. Everyone I think can appreciate this Disney classic. It is so on the move it is sure to capture and keep attention spans of all levels ,and ages. I t is a movie you will not soon forget ,and you will want to watch it over and over. You will be right there with the characters threw each ,and every turn. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
73,Oliver & Company,,23 November 1998,The beginning of the NEW Disney Classics,"This was one of the first Disney movies that I remember seeing in the theater. I believe that this movie saved the Disney Company's reputation as a ""great"" animated movie maker. It was all uphill from here!"
74,Oliver & Company,6,17 September 2000,Maltin was right this time. This IS grungy.,"This is a rather weak Disney film. While certainly not their worst(cough Tarzan cough), Oliver and Company is probably their weakest film ever. This looks kinda like the prototype for the modern formula starting with The Little Mermaid, but the result came out rather half baked. The songs are neither the big affairs of the moderns nor the charming ones of the classics. Disney tried to be touching, funny, dramatic, and hip, but in every single one of those elements the movie ended up weak. The villain is also a rather weak character. He has hardly any motive at all. While an enjoyable family film, know that this isn't one of Disney's better ones."
75,Oliver & Company,4,24 August 1999,Disney's worst animated feature.,"Disney hasn't been too successful with its cat movies, since the other one, `The Aristocats' (1970), was probably the second worst.  -No, wait.  There' s also `The Lion King'.  Okay, scratch that theory.  It's really just that `The Aristocats' was the first in a line of cut-price, uncertain, fumbling animated features from the studio - not all of them bad, but all of them damaged in some way; and all of them (`The Aristocats' itself excepted) with some animation or artwork that looks as if it belongs on TV.  `Oliver and Company' is the last, but also the least.To begin with the artwork.  The animation is good in places - Disney's stable was getting better and would continue to get better - but it's betrayed by character designs that seem to be the result of no work whatever.  Oliver is just a round kitten and he looks like every other round kitten ever drawn.  Good animation can't take him very far.  And often the animation isn't THAT good.  Georgette moves like a marionette; and when she sings it's painfully apparent that her snout movements don't match the sounds coming out.  In passing, I'd like to say that the song I'm referring to is staged with remarkable ineptitude, that blunts whatever impact a performance by Bette Midler of Barry Manilow might otherwise have had. (Yes, exactly.)  Backgrounds look unfinished, humans are poorly integrated and Disney doesn't have the resources to make New York look at all populated.As for the story ... if you forget the occasional parallel with Charles Dickens, this is the story of a girl and her kitten.  (Yes, exactly.) Whatever slanders may have been voiced about Disney films being made for children, how many of them (the animated ones, I mean) are actually ABOUT children?  Well, it's possible to think of several that probably are, in a sort of a way, but there are always mitigating circumstances.  There's always SOME reason why the child's story might appeal to adults.  There are none here.  `A book worth reading only in childhood is not worth reading even then,' writes C.S. Lewis; to which we might add, `A film that's only good for children isn't good for anyone.'Sorry - this is only good for children."
76,Oliver & Company,5,1 May 2004,Bad 80's Animation Disney Style,"Still several years from the second golden age of Disney animation of Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin  this is a movie from the transition period, from the first time before Disney animation was barely alive.Listing nine people to retell the story of Oliver Twist this is a movie in need of a clue. It's gritty and ugly and much like the New York its set in before Rudy turned it around. Accurately portraying the city in which it's set is not really a plus here since the gritty style is in contrast to the Disney sweetness that keeps popping up.The songs are merely okay late 80's pop crap from a variety of writers that makes for no unity in the score. This is a film with too many cooks on every level and it shows. Its a perfect example of movie by blender.Its not wholly awful, actually its not bad, but it can be very abrasive to the point you don't want to keep watch it.(I give it 5 out of 10)Whats worse its all sub-Disney in animation to the point it looks like half a dozen bargain animation houses of the period.Let this film be a warning to all of the perils of cartoons by committee and what happens when its done just for the money."
77,Oliver & Company,3,17 July 2017,Decent yet underwhelming Disney film,"While not one of the big name Disney animated films this is enjoyable enough fare, with some nice voice acting, and a modern (at the time) twist on 'Oliver Twist' by Charles Dickens.It doesn't hold up to modern standards of animation, and looks a little dated now. Also, many of the voice actors (Billy Joel aside) aren't that well known today, so for kids now the fact that Billy Joel is voicing a dog isn't that much of a big deal.It's a decent film, but if you were given the choice of watching this or 'The Lion King' for example, I know which one most people would go for."
78,Oliver & Company,,17 September 2015,Oh so very dated,"You know those women, and to a lesser degree men, who, even when they're in their forties or fifties, still try to dress, look and sound like they're still in their twenties. Like they're still relevant and cool and hip. Of course you do. Well, not to be mean, but Oliver & Company is a lot like that. Made in the late 80s, and probably one of the Disney films that show its age the most, it's very heavily tied to the era it was made in. And not just the era, but the city of that era. In this case New York. Now, sometimes that wouldn't be that big of a deal. It'd be like a time capsule. But Disney films are supposed to be timeless, and this is anything but. I still get it, I was born in the 80s, even if barely, but I'm not sure that kids born today will get this when they grow up. It's just so disgustingly 80s.But yeah, that's more of a pet peeve of mine than an outright flaw of the movie, but it has some other problems as well. Like the villain, who has a cool visual design, but has next to no characteristics beyond the fact that he's a loan shark and trains dogs to do his bidding. Or the fact that the main character, Oliver, contributes nothing to the plot, aside from being the MacGuffin. Or even the animation style, which is once again so disgustingly 80s. I hate the way 80s are always made to look.Nevertheless, there's a lot of good stuff as well. The dog characters are all a lot of fun, with the possible exception of Georgette, who I can't make up my mind about. All of them have fun personalities and work well off each other. The film also contains some nice song sequences and is really the first true Disney musical in a while. The Great Mouse Detective had some songs, but not to this degree. Of the songs Why Should I Worry is especially worthy of notice.And yet I can't say that Oliver & Company is a particularly good film. It's certainly not awful and I have some fond memories of it from my childhood. But unlike so many other Disney films, it doesn't hold up when seen as an adult."
79,Oliver & Company,9,2 May 2011,Fuzzy Wuzzy Disney Doggies,"ooky. if you can't at least warm up to 'oliver & Co' you're a hard nut to crack. i'm sorry but this doggie day Disney romp is absolutely irresistible in my opinion, and a perfect example of how underrated the Disney hand drawn animated features were in the 80's and how expertly they carried the ""torch"" from old school Disney artist to the new school animators.i'm ooky sorry babies, 'All Dogs Go to Heaven' is a cute film but in terms of animation, 'Oliver' knocks 'All Dogs' right out of the ring. for one thing the dogs here look more like actual dogs than the rubber-hose designs of the 'All Dogs' mutts. the animated backgrounds of New York city are also outstanding and drawn with more distinction than the backgrounds in 'All Dogs'.everything in 'Oliver' is all-around better than 'All Dogs'. the music is better and the vocal performances are much better. you can hardly go wrong with the likes of Richard Mulligan, Bette Midler and Dom Deluise doing the vocals. Billy Joel is also excellent here and very accomplished as a actor, it makes you wonder why he didn't get more acting roles after this.also fans of Joey Lawrence and the super Natalie Gregory will be pleased to find them doing the voices of little 'Oliver' and the little girl. Lawrence was only nine years old at the time.the only ""problem"" i have with this film, and it's not really a ""problem"" of quality, but i sometimes wonder if Cheech Marin is really very acceptable for a family film and a Disney film at that. i'm sure Walt Disney would have hated Cheechie and found him to be a very questionable reprobate. those concerns aside, Cheech Marin's Tito is hilarious and one of the most memorable characters in the movie. and i don't think Tito would have been as cute and funny with anyone but Marin doing the voice here. i love it when Tito is startled and runs around screaming ""gang war! gang war!"". high-larry-us.it is also very sad to note that the New York Twin Towers are featured prominently here in many scenes. a shocking reminder of how the New York city skyline has changed since the 80's.this review is dedicated to the memory of the Twin Towers and the horrible waste of human life on 9/11.-james johnston 5/2/011"
