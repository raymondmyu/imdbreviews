0,Loveless,9,3 October 2017,"Selfies, selfishness and sex: a pessimistic view on society","""Nelyubov"" (""Loveless"") starts as a psychological movie about a divorcing couple, then evolves into a thriller after their child disappears, focusing on the search. Yet overall it is a critical view on modern society, notably Russian.*** WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS ***The tone is pessimistic. The story focuses on a few individuals, however news heard on the radio or TV are depressing: the end of the world, corruption, war (Ukraine). Characters are confronted to a harsh environment: at work, bosses impose their arbitrary views to employees (no divorce, religion); the police cannot assist to find a missing child; missing children are commonplace.The main victims of society are children. They are not desired: Zhenya wishes she had aborted; none of the parents want to keep Alyosha; we understand Boris' girlfriend got pregnant ""by accident"". They are not taken care of: Zhenya did not have any milk for Alyosha when he was a baby (a revealing metaphor); Zhenya and Boris only realise after two days that their son is missing; at the end, Boris removes the crying baby instead of taking care of him.All this is a repetition of the past: Zhenya was not desired by her mother either and now has harsh contacts with her. Hence we feel that eventually children will grow up to be like their parents, forever perpetuating the lack of love within families. This perpetuation is emphasised by similar shots at the beginning and end of the movie: empty snowy landscapes with the same tense music.The ""loveless"" context spreads to all relationships: Zhenya tells Anton she loves him but he does not answer; at the restaurant, a young lady easily gives her mobile number to a complete stranger before sitting down with her date. People only care about themselves: what matter most is wealth (Zhenya's comment about Anton), appearance (the beauty parlour) and social media (various selfies). Symbolically, when the coordinator questions Alyosha's friend at school, the blackboard in the background shows cold mathematical formulas instead of words or drawings (detail emphasised afterwards when the teacher erases the board).The atmosphere is not only bleak: it deteriorates progressively, noticeably after Alyosha's disappearance. This evolution is illustrated in different ways:1. SITUATIONS. At the beginning, Zhenya and Boris are separating cruelly, but are hoping for a fresh start in new relationships. These are shown in parallel, always in the same two apartments, highlighting their similarities and hence developing a systemic view on couples. First, the vision seems positive: the two new couples each have dialogues and a long erotic scene. However, couples then slowly drift apart: dialogues are reduced, doubts about the relationship emerge, there are no erotic or tender scenes any more. Finally, couples are physically separated despite being in the same home: Anton watches TV while Zhenya practices on the balcony; Boris watches TV while his girlfriend talks to her mother in the kitchen.2. IMAGE. To start with, shots highlight the tension between Zhenya and Boris, living together unwillingly: the camera uses long focals (sharp foregrounds, blurred backgrounds); frames are saturated (Boris in the crowded elevator, Zhenya in the crowded metro, close shots on the tray at the canteen, etc.). After Alyosha disappears, characters seem lost among high buildings, deserted places and endless forests. They increasingly bump against elements: cold and wet weather, metal fences (twice), large river, gigantic radar in the middle of the forest. Noises are menacing: barking dogs, traffic, planes, etc.3. PLACES. After Alyosha disappears, cosy apartments are replaced by Zhenya's mother's neglected house, then a huge derelict building, then a dreadful mortuary. The sequence in the derelict building is pivotal: it used to be a pleasant place of gathering (room with many seats), music (standing piano) and enjoyment (beautiful art deco bar); all is now destroyed. The schoolyard, where children ran at the very beginning of the movie, is now empty, just filled with snow. At the very end, Alyosha's bedroom is torn down and completely reworked: the little that remained of the boy's soul is definitely gone.4. ALYOSHA. The boy actually is the main role: he opens the movie and is very present in the first part; after he disappears the entire plot revolves around his search. Yet we never see him again: this vacuum becomes the icon of a soulless society. The only elements that eventually remain from him are the posters with his picture, scattered in empty places, and the tape he threw into the tree at the beginning: two derisory reminders of his existence. (Side note: the tape is striped red-and-white for safety, announcing the forthcoming tragedy.)The overall message is: we could have built a convivial society, but instead brought void and selfishness. Economic conditions can only partly be blamed since characters belong to middle or upper class. At the end, Zhenya is running on a machine, outside in winter, wearing a training suit proudly showing ""RUSSIA"": this cold society seems to be moving, but it is standing still, going nowhere. Meanwhile, Anton and Boris are watching propagandist news on TV. The allegory could hardly be more explicit: it is common knowledge that Zvyagintsev is very critical towards his country in general and the present government in particular.That said, ""Nelyubov"" has a few downsides. First, it is almost too skillful: messages and codes ooze from every situation, with minutely crafted images. Also, the vision is hopeless: nobody is truly positive, except maybe Alyosha who precisely disappears and the volunteers who mostly remain anonymous (the exception being the coordinator, who is nevertheless severe). Last, characters are somewhat stereotyped: to summarise, women are hysterical and men autistic. All these elements render the movie relatively one-sided, almost cynical: everything is thrown overboard.Nonetheless, ""Nelyubov"" remains an aesthetically impressive movie, to the extent that it never feels long despite its minimal action. Zvyagintsev again demonstrates he now is one of the leading Russian directors. His mastery seems to increase with every movie."
1,Loveless,9,15 October 2017,Reflects the growing emptiness of human relationships,"Whether or not it is designed as an allegory of modern Russia, no film in recent memory has examined the growing emptiness of human relationships with such expressive force as Andrei Zvyagintsev's (""Leviathan"") Loveless, a heart wrenching drama about a couple on the brink of divorce whose emotional neglect of their son leads to devastating consequences. Though the film has been characterized as ""bleak,"" the feeling tone is more like sadness and regret that many today have lost the capacity for compassion and empathy. Accompanied by Evgeny Galperin's rich cascading piano score, the film opens as cinematographer Mikhail Krichman surrounds us with the quiet beauty of a Russian winter.Almost immediately, we are staring at an cold-looking stone building that could easily be a prison in Siberia. There is no sound or movement. Suddenly a door opens and children, released from school, swarm through its exits. Though some are laughing, it is not a happy scene. 12-year-old Aloysha (Matvey Novikov) makes his way home through a barren forest but there are no warm greetings awaiting him. The marriage between his mother, beauty-salon owner Zhenya (Maryana Spivak) and his father Boris (Alexey Rozin, ""Leviathan""), a desk-ridden management functionary, is over. Seeking status, money, and freedom, both are immersed in new relationships. Boris is with the pregnant Masha (Marina Vasilyeva, ""Name Me"") and Zhenya with the well-to-do business executive Anton (Andris Keishs, ""What Nobody Can See"").Though their apartment has been advertised for sale and their divorce is in its final stages, custody of Alyosha has not yet been agreed upon. It is clear that he is an unwanted child, the result of an unexpected pregnancy and a marriage of convenience. Like emotionless machines, the warring couple continue their repetitive spiral of mutual recrimination as Alyosha crouches behind the bathroom door. Fearful and alone he absorbs every last ounce of malice, his face becoming contorted into a mass of silent tears that well up from deep within his being. It is a shocking scene that mirrors every despair the world has ever known.Since the film takes place in the year 2012, talk radio focuses on the Mayan calendar and its apocalyptic date in December. News reports tell us about the bloody war in the Ukraine. Amidst the barely-controlled paranoia in the air, Boris tells a co-worker that he is afraid to lose his job if his boss, a fundamentalist Christian, finds out about his impending divorce. Fear of losing his job becomes secondary, however, when Zhenya tells him that Alyosha has not shown up for school for two days and is now missing. Far from coming together to patch up their differences, however, the estranged couple only double-down on their mutual acrimony.The inefficient police offer little expectation that they can find the boy and try to reassure the parents that, in most cases, a missing child is with a friend or relative or out on an adventure and will soon return home. Not satisfied with officialdom's inertia, they turn to a volunteer group who put up posters, talk to teachers and neighbors. An interview with Alyosha's only friend points them to an abandoned apartment in the middle of a forest. In a scene of eerie darkness where there is a palpable feeling of hopelessness and loss, the rescuers, wearing bright orange jackets, comb every space in the decrepit building but Alyosha is not found.A boy matching Alyosha's description is found at a nearby hospital but it is not him, and a subsequent visit to the morgue only offers more tears. Taking a risk, the two visit Alyosha's mother but the visit only succeeds in bringing hatred up to a level of ecstasy. With no explanation in sight, Zvyagintsev teases us with the sight of an unknown man walking alone into the forest, a man hidden from the camera in a fancy restaurant asking a call girl for her phone number which she provides while looking directly into the camera, a man pausing at a bus stop to read the flier about the missing boy, then turning and walking away, and a teacher cleaning her blackboard after students have left.These tantalizing scenes, however, do not bring us any closer to a solution to the mystery of Alyosha's disappearance. Loveless is a deeply disturbing film that explores the dark places of human behavior, upending our most cherished beliefs about the bond between parents and children. Making it clear about what can happen when an unwanted child is brought into the world, Anton tells Zhenya that no one can survive a life without love. If Loveless serves as any kind of warning, it may be to help us discover that the world cannot survive either unless we begin to re-envision it as sacred."
2,Loveless,8,1 October 2017,Excellent drama about unhappy people,"Parents love their children. It's one of the most fundamental and universal forces in the world.But not in this film. Zhenya openly regrets not having aborted her son, who is now 12 years old, and her husband Boris agrees that an abortion would have been better for everyone. This unhappy family is finally falling apart: Zhenya and Boris are getting a divorce and are considering a boarding school for their son. Both hope to find happiness with new partners, and clearly they don't want the boy to interfere.This situation takes an unexpected twist when the son doesn't turn up at home after school. Reluctantly, the parents inform the police about the missing child. A volunteer corps starts a search of the neighbourhood. Even after the boy's computer is inspected, his best friend has revealed their secret hideaway, and his grandmother has been visited for possible clues, the boy is not found.The search for the boy puts Boris and Zhenya in a ambivalent situation: they are supposed to be heartbroken, but in reality they consider the disappearance of their son as a rather fortunate event. On their minds are their respective new partners, more than the whereabouts of the boy.Just leave it to director Andrey Zvyagintsev to turn this situation into an excellent, but pitch black drama without even the least shimmer of hope. The hate between Boris and Zhenya is extremely intense, and the rest of the cast doesn't show much human warmth either. On countless occasions, the characters check the screen of their smartphone. When nobody exchanges a smile or a kind word, digital friendships are better than nothing. The last scenes are the most desperate: even with their new partners, Boris and Zhenya don't seem to find any happiness.Surprisingly, Zvyangintsev doesn't use any urban decay or Russian dreariness to accentuate the general negativism. On the contrary, Moscow looks modern and many scenes could just as well have been set in an American or European city.Apart from the drama of a family falling apart, the film has something to say about Russia. There are news flashes about the war with Ukraine, and a police officer complains about not having enough resources to fight all the crime that's going on. The ultimate metaphorical statement is in the very last scene: Zhenya is running on a treadmill, wearing a training jacket with 'Russia' on it - not even in Cyrillic letters. The message: Russia is wasting its energy and not making any progress."
3,Loveless,7,27 June 2017,A multi layered loveless story in a sociocultural context,"Grey day on the outskirts, silence and naked trees covered with the snow, the boy goes back home from the school playing with a red and white safety striped flagging tape that he will throw up on the tree branches and where it will stay. This gesture starts the story of Alyosha and his parents Boris and Zhenya, a family in the middle of divorce process. The latest movie of Russian director Andrei Zvyagintsev Loveless (Nelubov') is a drama film that will show us a multi layered and rich in its senses story.At the very beginning of the film we witness a verbally brutal quarrel between the spouses in which each of them try to avoid to keep the son. Both have already new partners and look forward to finally get rid of all disturbing for their future happy life circumstances. While parents assume Alyosha is sleeping or, what is more likely, they don't care at all about if he can hear them, we see the boy hiding behind the door and silently bursting out in tears. Here is one of two most emotional peaks of the film. The two traumatic and heartbreaking climaxes (the second one at the end of the film) both include the boy, and it could be supposed that his figure is not only the trigger of the story but also something more like a core of the ideas represented in the movie. Born in 2000, disappeared in 2012 (both dates are connected with elections in Russia), wearing the red jacket (the colour of love) on the search photo and leaving the blue one (the colour of devotion and honesty) as the only detail they found from him after his disappearance, the character of Alyosha frames and seems to embody the changing atmosphere in society. Significantly, red and blue colours turn at the end into the white-blue-red training suit of Zhenya while she running on treadmill at the balcony of her luxurious new flat. The caption 'Russia' decorates her sweatsuit and, without a doubt, highlights one of the most easy-to-grasp metaphors, that director wanted to present his vision with.Andrei Zvyagintsev puts an emphasis on details, often symbolic ones, and use them as a tool to transmit his personal views and comments on society. Loveless is full of tiny codes that the viewer could decipher according to his experience as well as origin. Zvyagintsev skilfully plays with stereotypes of contemporaneity such as family, success, politics and the national identity, and it would be too narrow to connect it only with Russian society. Often rough and too straightforward, the director steady prosects the world of the characters in conjunction with the atmosphere they live in, but, first of all, according to director's opinion, despite the desire of the viewer to believe without a doubt in it all is very strong. The environment of characters is supported on the background with carefully chosen bits of authentic TV and radio programs that reflect the current political and sociocultural state, the accidental small talks of other heroes in the movies work the same way.In Loveless the viewer sometimes could find him-/herself wondering that the heroes and their reality are often binary. The ordinary conflict of a man and a woman, the desire to be happy and the unhappy reality, the stagnating bureaucracy of the police and prompt response of the volunteers searching for Alyosha, almost no shades in between. The end of the movie eliminates even this scarce diversity, bringing the director's relentless conclusion about contemporary human soul to its totality. Common knowledge, that at its best could be characterised by Leo Tolstoy phrase that 'happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way' in this movie doesn't work. In their new 'happy' families Boris and Zhenya are equally lost, apathetic and even speechless. Seems that the loveless goes on and one can wonder if it was ever different."
4,Loveless,10,27 August 2017,"Everything in life is a circling, if you won't manage to fix it, karma will always follow you","The director Zvyagintsev perfectly displays how imperfect are people today. The film shows how much people can not love each other, be selfish, and how not to be happy. The message is very clear, it does not call you to not love, but opposite, shows the effect of it. Hate and loveless is in every second and shot of the film. And also music, is very cold and strongly underlines the emptiness from love in the reality.Two main protagonists, the parents  Boris and Evgenia, are both negative characters. Both filled with a heap of resentment, despair and sorrow from unfulfilled hopes and dreams. Their emotions are like a stretched string that does not make a sound. The words of Evgenia  ""I just want to be happy"" while crying shows her misery. Evgenia was saying that the only thing she dreamt about is to leave her mother, and we can understand her after watching her mother's hysterical monologue in the house. She is a woman who cares only about social media and reality shows about love on TV in the evenings, who regrets having a son, and every time she was showing that and every time it sounded terrible... Even not calling him a man in front of other people. From other perspective she is acting as a good friend and a perfect woman in front of her rich lover. Boris is a man who cares only about having a good job and a good name in the company. He is not able to be a loving husband or a father what is displayed in the end of the film. His new life did not born any new feelings in him, the only thing he is interested are the news on TV. After parents decide to divorce after 12 years of marriage and come to the point where their son Alesha has no place in their new lives, decide to give him away to children's home but they can't decide who will tell him about that as none of them really cares how he will be. After young boy hears the conversation he decides to run away from the house. Before he was a cute boy, playing, drawing, chatting with a friend about some cool places in the forest but after this conversation he even stronger realized that after school his way will be to children's house..all his hopes died. This very small scene with him is very emotional, I personally couldn't take it out of my head throughout the whole film. After that we don't see the boy in the film and I was not interested watching his parents at all. Only thing what was on my mind was a boy, but here is the most genius decision we face the reality. After the tragedy watching parent's reaction was shameful. They were trying to visually participate in looking for the son but all this was fake. Again director displays today's people's priorities. Giving away the number in the restaurant quickly and going back to the table with non- handsome but rich man, scrolling news feed non-stop, taking pictures and drinking for love and selfies. Also can't not mention the police, their words that ""statics are always right"", their indifferent approach to the situation, ""be thankful for having an information how it works"" and then we see volunteers who are looking for an unknown to them boy day and night non-stop for free, and after that we ask, who is working in the police? Where is humanity? Cast is perfect, never extra people in the film, with each shot getting only important information about the protagonists.The open ending films always make you think about the story, so what happened? But in my case I thought about a detail in morgue (which was really emotional) if the boy that was found was really him or notwho knows maybe it was him and parents decided to not to know about it? But otherwise they would have felt better if they ""got rid of him"" that way. Camera work is amazing! It was a pleasure to watch the scenes. Colours, angles and eloquent shots that were saying everything! In the first seconds when it was shown naked trees and also a broken tree at the lake, it straight away gave the atmosphere that something will go wrong Also the music was brilliant, it was fulfilling the atmosphere. The scare, fairs, hateall was felt in the music. Remarkably, I liked the film and an open ending could be interpreted in different ways, but for me it was clear that whatever happens, people don't change. Boris is cold to his new child and wife And Evgenia also became as cold as she was with Boris in the beginning.. scrolling her phone and not being as lovely as before.I would recommend it to everyone and ask to analyze for themselves, what they will find in common."
5,Loveless,10,22 October 2017,"Loveless is an unforgettable experience, a film that is recommended to everyone.","Andrey Zvyagintsev is one of the best directors nowadays and i truly regard Loveless his greatest film so far. It is a complex, deep portrait of a society in decay since it is composed of superficial people, extremely selfish and harsh. What really matters is their little world and their perfect image which is filtered through the social media. People totally empty whose attitude will have tragic consequences. Loveless is a socking experience because of its unbearable truth. This society that is described could be anywhere. Not only in Russia. So, besides the perfect screenplay, Loveless carries an absolutely powerful direction and a hauntingly beautiful cinematography. Moreover editing, music and acting are all top class. Loveless is an unforgettable experience, a film that is recommended to everyone. It will make you think and think for good. 10/10"
6,Loveless,9,24 December 2017,Might be the best and most melancholic film of the year.,"Loveless is a depressingly profound experience. It paints the world as it is, not shying away from showing the bitter emptiness, disconnect and sorrow (which we usually choose to ignore) that surrounds our society. The desperate search for happiness, the unbelievable selfishness, lack of compassion and love, as the title suggests, that seperates generations of people in our modern times of self-absorbed(""anti"")social media. 
The film manages to achive these incredible feats (without being preachy) in its fantastically written and acted multi-layered and complex characters, whom as the story goes on beautifully unravel from just simple despicable people to characters that you understand and by the end sort of empathize with and pity (though not all of them: the character of the father is kind of an exception, he's a bit underdeveloped). Though our main characters represent what is wrong with our society, Loveless manages to keep a hopeful balance showing the good side as well with its selfless side-characters, the search party. Andrey Zvyagintsev's direction is immaculate, from the beautiful cinematography, with its lingering shots of the dreary Russian winterlands and cityscapes filling you with a sense of melancholy and loneliness, to the authentic writing and the tragic story itself.Loveless is a tough watch that challenges the warped values of the 21st century, holding a mirror towards our modern society, still unable to escape the same endless cycle it's always been trapped in. A dour but realistic meditation on humanity's need for love./as schmaltzy or cheesy as this review sounds I assure you the film is the furthest thing from being those things./"
7,Loveless,9,22 November 2017,Loveless and hopeless world,"There have been numerous films about a child missing while the parents are separated. A lot of them have worked on many levels and explored the possibilities of drama out of it. Yet Zvyagintsev managed to make a compelling film about the same situation without trying anything new with the plot but by using the time and world we live in itself to give life to the film. Modern life, ambition, stability and the Russian society play the crucial part in forming the film. But even with all these familiar aspects, it's the distinct eye of Zvyagintsev that gives a spiritual visualization and elevates the film. The world here is not dark and violent but bleak and hopeless that terrifies you even more. Though at times you get a feeling that the director leans towards a more patriarchal society which is a bit of a reversion."
8,Loveless,7,24 September 2017,The end of the world is already here,"The case when the movie causes physical pain. If to characterize the film, I can say this: ""You're asking if there will be an end of the world? But it has already come!"".On the one hand, the film shows a rather trivial situation, when the family is in trouble, there is no peace. Boredom and dullness. On the other hand, Evil is clearly shown as a form of total dislove. No one loves anybody: neither the mother the son, nor the husband wife, nor the man of man... Poor, lonely people are everywhere and forever."
9,Loveless,10,30 December 2017,Soaked in pathos,"In many ways this film is so Russian that unless you are Russian or have spent a considerable time in Russia you may miss many of the subtler parts of this film - recurring motifs - but this does not detract from an absolutely intelligent and realistic film.Heavy on symbolism I remained enthralled throughout, a deeply original and emotive work that will resonate in the mind long after viewing. A Masterpiece.It deserves no less than the maximum 10/10."
10,Loveless,8,3 December 2017,The love for films in the rest of the world,"Filmmakers around the world has always recreated cinema in their own way, contrasting with the films made in Hollywood, that in a certain point become the same, that is to say, are made with the same ""mold"". The foreign cinema, specially from Europe, America and Asia has acquired his own identity, but with pass of time we can say that this films are made with the same ""mold"", but obviously, one different from Hollywood's.I think no one can deny the much contributions that Hollywood has made to cinema, since the beginning of this art they have improved the way we watch and consume movies and how these are made. This have its consequence, the over exploitation of films, especially of a specific genre; in the 50's were the musicals and now are the super-heroes movies but international filmmakers (and from Hollywood itself too) always find another way to tell a story. In 20's were the Russians and Germans, then the Italians, with artistic movements that change films forever and then in response to the repetitive stagnation of ideas in Hollywood, the Nouvelle Vague (the ""new wave"" of french cinema) made his own contribution. They were the beginning of the foreign cinema that now is still alive and for me is better than many of the Hollywood films.""Nelyubov"" represents that, the actual foreign cinema that is the son of that foreign films from the 20th century. This movie sometimes reminds me to movies from Luis Buñuel or Jean-Luc Godard, and a lot to Michael Haneke's ""Caché"", we can say are similar in some aspects, but I think they seem to be made with the same ""model"" because they represent the same: the voice that says that the cinema is not only Hollywood.This movie is incredible, is so beautifully and carefully made; is awesome how it takes his time to express and show how the characters are and what his title means, you see the two main characters and their lack of love, how that transform their lives and most important how it determines another person's life, in this case the boy. After we saw everything about both parents and how they try to find love far from the other (being his son the only link between both) a situation when they need to be together appears.The film change totally from this point and in the searching of the boy we check that the parents can not be together and we wonder what will happen at the end. I thought they were going to find the boy, it was surprising the end, letting you some questions and reflections. Andrey Zvyagintsev, the director of the films does an spectacular job, it manage very well the rhythm of the movie, that sometimes seems slow but like I said, it takes his time and in the end everything was necessary. The shots, that don't show many movement and the information that the movie gives to the audience is pretty careful.The cinematography is great, with a tone that shows the coldness and unhappy life of the characters. The music is another aspect to mention, is very good, Evgueni Galperine & Sacha Galperine does an amazing job, and the performances are also amazing, both when they cry, fight or smile (the latter the least we see).In conclusion, I think this film is one of the best of the year and I expect to see it in the award season that's coming, is well done in every aspect and is part of the current foreign cinema, that pays homage to his predecessors."
11,Loveless,8,26 November 2017,A portrait of the dark side of human relationships!,"This movie surprised me. I was expecting something different when I started watching it but in the end it left me with a horrible melancholy and a hole in my chest. I do not recommend watching this movie on a Saturday evening while it's raining outside because chances are, you're going to get even more depressed. I love the photography and the colors, it definitely adds a certain bit of despair to the story. I believe that was exactly what the director intended: to pass this feeling onto the screen and he does that with the way he plays around with the colors. If you're watching this movie in hope of getting a happy ending then don't because all about this movie is tragedy. The characters' lives are full of tragedy and so are their respective endings. I had to notice, also, that there's a political criticism during the movie. The war, the ending of the world, it's almost like this movie carries a sense of hopelessness. The film's last scene is one that I won't forget for the next days because even in the end, the characters cannot find peace and both of them return to their own lives with the people who are now their loved ones but they are still left with an emptiness and we get the feeling that they will never be truly over it. There's no happy ending here, there's no big story in the middle of this.. Just the events of an unusual family who mistreats their son and end up having to deal with the consequences of their errors. I questioned myself what the final take meant when the barricade tape is revealed. Was this ending always meant to be? Or is it just there for us to remember that things change and at the same time, they stay the same? (the father doesn't take care of the baby but instead, ignores him). I don't know the answer but this is a fascinating movie."
12,Loveless,5,20 August 2017,Loveless,"Andrei Zvyagintsev's film ""Loveless"" is about a middle class couple getting divorced because they understand that their marriage is loveless. The beginning of the film is promising  the son overhears his parents talking that they want to give him up to the orphanage after their divorce because he is an obstacle for their further happy life.However after the child disappears, the film becomes completely pointless and uninspiring. It contains a lot of meaningless conversations, not very exciting sex with plain looking people, and all this occurs against the boring background of drab and colorless Moscow apartments.Towards his characters director is clearly loveless; they are entirely uninteresting to him, but unfortunately they become uninteresting not only to the author, but also to the viewer. The director obviously skimped on the actors because he thought that for the depiction of such humdrum personalities good actors were not needed. The result is flat, lifeless, paper-thin characters. The course of events is mundane and very predictable. The sole protagonist  the son  vanishes so quickly that we do not have time to get to know or love him. It is especially important to note the mediocre camera-work. The centric composition is ordinary and inexpressive. Lighting is poorly thought out. The only beautiful shots are of the frozen lake and the rest of the footage is very banal. This is quite surprising, because cinematographer Mikhail Krichman is the same one who worked on Zvyagintsev's previous, much more visually expressive films. At the end of the film we see a television broadcast of events in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine  loveless and divorced. However, this association looks contrived. The heroine wearing a tracksuit with Russia imprinted upon it, is a prototype of Russia, tired and not loving its children. But this metaphor by Zvyagintsev seems calculated, inorganic and senseless. The film looks very inexpensive and as if done in a hurry. Andrei Zvyagintsev, who previously proved himself to be a high level master with the film ""Leviathan"", is disappointing in this picture. In ""Leviathan"" there were brilliant acting performances, amazing locations and profound thoughts. ""Loveless"" unfortunately only manages to arouse epithets with a suffix LESS.Read more at: http://indie-cinema.com/"
13,Loveless,2,11 October 2017,One dimensional characters in a one dimensional story.,"First of all I like to state that I'm a huge Andrey Zvyagintsev fan. Since his debut with Vozvrashchenie in 2003, on which he rightfully won the Golden Lion on the Venice Film Festival and with it's his followup movies The Banishment (2007), Elena (2011) and Leviathan (2014) nothing seems to be able to harm Zvyagintsev's brilliance in movie-making. Until now. Loveless is truly an overrated movie which is way to long, the story itself could have easily been told in 90 minutes instead of more then two hours. Sometimes long movies contribute with characters to develop, but in this movie the characters remains shallow, the boy that disappears has no depth in his character role what so ever so it's very hard to feel the ""pain"" of his disappearance. And also because the main two actors, husband and wives, show lack of depth in character it's pretty hard to get some kind of connection with the actors. But then you also have this tedious and most terrible aspect of this movie: quality of acting, or rather, a lack of acting quality. The only thing you see from the this wife character is anger, frustrations, as well when looking at her husband. You only see anger and frustration and fear, fear of how colloquies would react on work when he would state that he has been divorced. Literally everything in this scenario points out towards the same direction: the parents are all egocentric, self-indulgent angry people who have only interest in themselves or in the maybe consequences when divorce is imminent. The victim is without a doubt the child. It's so one sided and lacks so much nuances that the characters are becoming, for me at least, a characterization of the evil self destructing ego. A stereotype you might state of the egocentric side of humans. But life itself is anything but one dimensional and because of the one dimensional characters in this movie makes this movie hard to watch, let alone a movie to take seriously. A pity, because I'm a real fan of Andrey Zvyagintsev, I've got all of his movies but I'm not eager to add this one to my movie collection."
14,Loveless,10,25 December 2017,A masterpiece.,Loveless is a very adult themed movie. Its truly one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The story is very difficult to take and its not exactly the happiest movie. Its a breath of fresh air compared to the trash that is being produced nowadays.
15,Loveless,,3 December 2017,One of the year's most heartbreaking movies,"Russian Director Andrey Zvyagintsev's 2014 LEVIATHAN was one of the best movies of that year (it was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film). It took a relationship drama and made it into a stunning commentary on government corruption. LOVELESS is more intimately told and focused, but, it certainly isn't without larger concerns. A married couple, Zhenya (Maryana Spivak) and Boris (Aleksey Rozin) are going through a divorce yet still living together in a Moscow apartment they are jointly trying to sell. Both are having affairs. Literally lost amongst this is their son Alyosha (Matvey Novikov). Right from the start we hear the parents bickering over custody of the boy - NOT over who wants the child, but, who gets 'stuck' with him. Unsurprisingly, the boy becomes a runaway. In a normal movie, you'd think that their son's disappearance would draw them closer as they search for him. Not in Zvyagintsev's LOVELESS. Far from it. Their search seems more a social obligation than one out of genuine emotion. It's a cold detached point of view, and one matched by a stern police office on the 'case'. The only dim rays of hope are provided by a private advocacy group that looks for runaways. The movie is set in late 2012 and there are mentions of the Mayan Calendar's End of the World prediction for that year, adding to the downbeat mood.The acting is strong in a low key manner. Zvyagintsev's Direction is clean and precise with well thought out camera compositions. The minimal score is spare but effective. And, while Zvyagintsev does attack the system as directly as he did with LEVIATHAN, the image of Zhenya running on a treadmill outdoors in a freezing Moscow wearing a bright red jumpsuit emblazoned with the word ""Russia"" (in English) in large letters can't help but beg mention. It may be difficult to say one 'enjoyed' a distressing movie like LOVELESS, but, it earn your admiration."
16,Loveless,10,22 November 2017,Excellent look into modern day egoistic marriage,"To me, this film is about selfishness and inability to accept responsibility for one's actions. This is such a relevant topic not only in Russia but pretty much everywhere in Europe. People are so convinced that the only that matters in their lives is their personal happiness and nothing else. And if you have made a mistake in your past, someone else, not you is responsible for this mistake.The film starts with a very typical argument between exes that is filled with accusations from both sides. It is clear that the married couple who are in the middle of the divorce have never been happy. They have let someone else decide that they had to get married and have been quite unhappy and unfulfilled since. It is their parent's fault, their society's fault, it is their child's fault that they are unhappy. They actually believe that it was not their own doing and their own choice. And now that they are stuck in this situation they are both seeking the easiest way out, and that does not include their son. The father's attitude is extremely common among Soviet men, that it is mothers responsibility to take care of the child, and in 99% of cases that is exactly what would happen. Except, in this case, the mother is also selfish. She does not want the burden of bringing the child to her new lover. So her blame and bitterness are clear to everyone, including the child himself. I can not imagine the pain of the child and what it could do to someone's psyche. Knowing that you are not loved and not wanted, that you are in the way of your parents' happiness. So it is no wonder that he decides to run away.Even though it should be every parent's worst nightmare, this is exactly what they both wanted. To get rid of him. But of course, this does not result in happiness either. Now they have even more things to blame for their miserable lives."
