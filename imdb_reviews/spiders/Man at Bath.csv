0,Man at Bath,6,4 August 2012,film in need of a better standard of review,"The reviews here aren't yet terribly informative concerning what you will see in this film. Though thanks to stimablue above for some information on Francois Sagat.The film is typical in style of the trend in French 'cottage' gay cinema film making current today. Taking the philosophy of the 1960s 'Nouveau Vague' movement's distrust for artifice, french cinema is concerned with finding new forms which don't uphold fantasy, make believe or 'Hollywood' style pretences. The many approaches characterises much which constitute's the typical French film today.France continues to produce a steady stream of significant gay films, more so than nearly all other countries except America. Also, a recent general trend for films released in the the gay film world sees an increase in hand-held, DIY, everyday mocumentary styles and Homme au bain is no exception.So what do we have here ? The story is a novel reversal of expectations where a couple who obviously have a passion for each other are facing a split. It's not sure if the rift is intentional or simply because one partner is going away but the film portrays what happens during the period when this separation occurs. The title - 'A man takes a Bath' is a french idiomatic expression referring to the idea of a man who suffers a loss of standing.The french setting is a gay sub-community existing in a French suburban housing project environment. These landscapes are more conventionally portrayed in France as the problematic zones of racial division & social exclusion. The film draws attention to the fact that a multi racial gay life also exists in such places. It shows a 'ghettoised' portrayal of a variety of gay characters where the main impetus for existence is negation and exploration of one's sensual desires. No other clue of how these people exist in the wider world is given. So the idea of a loss of standing is expanded by the narrowness of what we see.The New York sections also focus on the same narrow selection of ideas. However, 'Cinema' itself, as a theme is self referentially added where Emmanual's (Francois Sagat) ex-partner & visitor to NYC is the one filming all the American sections from within the story and also where the purpose of his trip is in part to visit the showing a friend's (graduation ?) film. However, enactments of sensual desire dominates the action we see in NYC too. The body and love, longing and comfort remain ever present.The film has a slight narrative plot. What we see is very quotidian but the film remains loyal to it's chosen select meditation and one or two of the scenes glimpsing the intimacy and humanity of ordinary acts of desire are unexpected, startling and fresh even in their simplicity.The over-all message is reassurance through the portrayal of how key emotional moments actually take place in our daily life. For example, New York is highly accessible but seen to be a closed-in and over looked place in which to manifest private intimacy and it's not glamorous and unobtainable. It could very easily be the viewer in those scenes. Despite a somewhat grungy portrayal of desire which could be interpreted as exploitative and even anti climatic, there is in fact hope in this film, with a farewell speculation as to the lasting effect of the main couple's split and the actual strength of their love for each other."
1,Man at Bath,1,16 May 2011,the worst film i have seen in years.,"i saw this film today as part of the seattle international film festival. i've seen a lot of films in my life and this has to be one of the worst ever. i don't really think there is a plot and certainly no character development. the style of filming is very amateur. one of the few things i did like about the film was the nudity. i have no problem with that as this film has a very sexual tone and it's nice to see that the director and actors weren't shy. i had bets with a few of the other filmgoers today on how many people would walk out of this screening and i won the bet. i stopped counting at 22 (my guesstimate was ""over 20""). i really have no idea why this film was made. it will be forgotten in a few years as it has no relevance."
2,Man at Bath,2,18 December 2011,Homme au bain - is about realistic male sexuality & whatever else you read into it,"This type of film seems to be very popular in Europe. These foreign filmmakers are so lucky they get to shoot realistic/experimental films using real porn stars, popular movie actors, using convenient indoor/outdoor locations and inexpensive film cameras. It's obvious most of these films are not scripted and without a reasonable budget, so the performers in these films are usually working for free. Francois Sagat makes half a million dollars for some of the Adult films he stars in, I'm sure, and he has made many Adult films to live comfortably for the rest of his life. My guess as to why he would agree to play the part of a sex hungry guy, that also sells his body for quick cash, is probably the same reason he is a porn star. It's right up his alley (no pun intended) to do what he knows best, even if the director of this film cannot afford to pay him what he normally earns for one scene in a gay porn film. This film looks a lot like one that an aspiring filmmaker is shooting often with his buddies but will never get to release it here in America because it isn't a violent film that cost 50 to 150 million to make and it isn't a film that will make 100 million dollars in the first weekend.Movies, videos and other visual media are very influential. That has been proved especially true in the last 20 years. Europe has extremely less violence than America does because they focus most of their media on less violent issues. They have never been afraid to explore sexual issues as well, unlike America. Sexuality is still a taboo here in America, well, mostly male sexuality that is. Women have always been exploited through their bodies in the media for decades.In America, we have more violent situations occurring because everywhere we look in the media, there is something negative or violent happening. Most movies released every year in America has something to do with violence: endless car crashes, huge explosions, rapes, men fighting with other men in and out of bars Â– whether they're drunk or sober using their fists and large amounts of deadly weapons, endless serial killer movies, jealous female or male murderers and a long list of other useless/senseless movies that are made in America. The highest death rate every year has to be in America.OK, back to reviewing the film. No, there isn't much of a plot to follow or any ideal lead characters to root for or to wish any harm to. And I still enjoyed watching this film because it felt like a place away from home, a ""beautifully naked"" place or an environment I won't ever afford to experience in my lifetime because Europe is a very expensive place to live for someone like myself. I enjoy watching films that deal with sexuality freely without any ""Crazy-American"" hang-ups/issues. I like watching films that won't have me dreaming about someone stalking or killing me or vice versa. Remember, sexual films are good, violent films are bad.I have been trying to make experimental/realistic films like this for years without any luck and I admire those that make it happen in ways that look simple and possible one day for me."
3,Man at Bath,8,19 August 2014,Bathe me,"First off this is directed and written by truly a visionary talent that I absolutely love behind the camera and also his writing talent. He is able to capture his actors and also create a feel that leaves lasting impressions upon the viewer. He is it stunning in creating and building up his characters and also the scenarios those characters are going through. Christophe Honore is a brilliant talented young fresh original and brilliant director, He has directed so many very stunning films such as 2006's Dan's Paris and 2007's Love Songs and 2009's Making Plans for Lena, just to name a few.Just about every picture I see that he creates ends up leaving a lasting mark on my love affair of cinema. I was finally given the opportunity to watch this film titled, Man at Bath which was a 2010 film. What's interesting to note about this movie is this stars gay porn actor Francois Sagat. This would be his second main stream performance in a feature film. Now many die-hard gay porn lovers will know him throughout many of his pornographic films probably most notably in the many Titan Media Porn Studio film. His first main stream film was in the 2010 violent and controversy L.A. Zombie. Now he did appear in another mainstream movie but really didn't act, he was just billed as the male addict in 2009's Saw VI. He is a very muscular, beautiful, sexy handsome looking man and he is very gifted and versatile in the sexual department and also acting. Very lustful, very eye candy-ish. Very manly man in the overall persona, specifically in the gay porn world. He is of French nationality. Most recently a model. Many will know him as a pornographic God to the fans of his appearances and abilities. Ultimately it was a treat to see him acting in this movie.Your main character Emmanuel is a gay hustler who lives with his lover Omar. Both live in Paris. They fight and Emmanuel is heartbroken and has to basically strive for himself and on his own. Now Omar heads to Manhattan and the movie follows both men as they discover a new life and accepts on there challenges of breaking up and coming to terms with their current life settings. They have to ultimately find themselves again and both are having to struggle and find their ultimate stable in life.You can finish my review here: http://www.abucketofcorn.com/2014/08/man- at-bath-2010.html"
4,Man at Bath,10,26 September 2014,Erotic As Heck!,"Maybe it's just me but this film for all its moodiness and abstract story telling sure got my juices going. The lead is a former porn star and this guy sure knows how to flaunt his stuff. You never get tired of looking at his perfect body in all its shimmering glory. In one scene a woman pays him $20 just to look at his butt and since he is broke he agrees to the deal. She then strips down to show him her butt when her boyfriend walks in but as only the French can do the three end up in bed together. Ah, the French! There's no one like 'em! The story is not easy to follow and a couple of times I grumbled and groaned but my buddy kept telling me the film is very French and very New Wave so I had to quiet down and attempt to appreciate the film from my buddy's sophisticated point of view."
5,Man at Bath,5,26 May 2017,Sexually explicit but emotionally cold.,"It's impossible to know just how close to 'honesty' Christophe Honore comes in his film ""Man at Bath"" since this study of a gay relationship on the rocks gives us a set of characters that, if we relate to them at all, we do so with a fair amount of distaste. This is a very sexually explicit film but it is a film without love; the only character capable of love, you think, is Emmanuel and he's been denied it and in turn denies it to others. He's played by the gay porn star Francois Sagat with a reasonable degree of empathy; at least he's the only character on screen with whom you might identify with emotionally. Otherwise this film, which is also concerned with filmmaking as a livelihood and the process of 'acting' in general, is masturbatory in all the wrong ways. I am sure there must be a point to it as well as an audience but right now it's difficult to see either. On the plus side at least, one character has the good taste to read ""Franny and Zooey"" though he does so in the bath."
