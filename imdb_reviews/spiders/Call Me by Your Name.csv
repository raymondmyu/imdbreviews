0,Call Me by Your Name,10,23 January 2017,"""Call Me By Your Name"" perfectly adapted to film.","If you've read the book, you will not be disappointed. If you've not read the book, you must. They fit together as a beautiful work together. Companions in art. One without the other, and you just aren't as fulfilled. I cannot wait to reread the book.Timothée's performance is one for the history books. The Adele Excharpolous à la Blue is the Warmest Color of the year. His eyes are so expressive and every emotion and action is so deeply felt by this poor tortured soul that by the ending you cannot help but weep and feel at the absolute lowest you've ever been.Armie is portrayed to perfection, as well. His ""later"" and other phrases stand out so sharply in a world of prompt and prim dialect that it makes us feel engaged in a way that I've never felt by a movie. He was such an outsider and yet we were assimilating to his was as opposed to the way it should be. He, a guest, in Italy, for 6 weeks, leaves just as American as the day he arrived.Luca's obsession with men dancing and swimming pools and beautifully choreographed sex, is perfect for this story. I cannot think of a better match. Luca said in the Q&A afterward that he decided to change a few things from the book because not everything written in prose works on screen in a cinematic way, and if you've read the book, you will agree. He also said the author, who makes a small cameo in the film, thinks Luca's changes are better than the original form. So, that's affirming.Peach scene? Devastating. Sufjan's new songs? Devastating.This was a very sad movie but I loved every second. Let's hope Suspiria is even better. Luca G. might be the most exciting director working today. It was a privilege to watch this with him and the amazing cast and crew INCLUDING Sufjan. I hope Sony Pictures Classics doesn't mess up the distribution/awards campaign. This deserves praise.Also, 10/10 opening credits/font. Luca can do no wrong."
1,Call Me by Your Name,,2 February 2017,A Cinematic Classic,"How can any review rightfully describe Call Me By Your Name? I had the immense privilege of seeing it at Sundance before 99.99% of the world, so now I am one of the select few in charge of p(r)eaching the gospel that is Call Me By Your Name. This film is simply a masterpiece, possibly the best romance film of all time, and one of the best films of all time as well.The plot is basic, but it is how the story is told through the actors, the imagery, and the music where the film shines. The son of an academic (Elio, played by Timothee Chalamet) falls in love, perhaps hopelessly, with a visiting student (Oliver, played by Armie Hammer) who is staying with his family ""somewhere in northern Italy."" Almost all reviewers will describe it as a gay romance, some will say it's just about two people falling in love (and they will get criticized for trying to downplay the sexuality of the characters), but at its core it is about two people who fall in love with one another but have difficulty realizing that the other feels the same way. It is a universal film about love, sensuality, longing, and being true to oneself.While most romance films are unrealistic, melodramatic, or otherwise uninspired, Call Me By Your Name is anything but. The first hour is tension-filled with innuendo in the actions between the main characters and the other people in the story that realistically captures the delicate dance involved in flirting. The passion that develops is palpable, with some of the best love scenes to grace the cinema - complete with the awkwardness involved. The ending may be predictable, but how everything plays out is a masterclass of film-making. The final monologue between father and son towards the end will be the highlight for most people. Michael Stahlbarg gives a breathtaking performance as he calmly provides his son comfort, but most importantly, acceptance. However, the emotional peak of the film truly comes at its end, with a haunting final shot that will stay with me forever. Timothee Chalamet is a revelation and is destined to become one of modern cinema's finest actors. Armie Hammer finally has a role that allows him to shine. While many will be surprised at the casting on paper, it is a testament to the actors that you can truly feel the passion between their characters so much that the pairing feels like destiny. Call Me By Your Name is a moving film that stays with you, leaving a dark depression for days that arises not from what happens in the movie, but how it is shown. It is so beautiful, but heart-wrenching at the same time, that it reminds us how amazing life is despite that our desires are not always, if ever, truly fulfilled. The film teaches the viewer important life lessons that have already deeply impacted me as a person and how I intend to live my life. The central question it asks is best summarized through a question asked by a character in the film: ""Is it better to speak, or to die?"" After the film, one can only leave with one logical conclusion: To speak, because to die, is to die without ever knowing the answer. And for Elio, regardless of how the relationship ends up (see the film!), at least he knows the answer."
2,Call Me by Your Name,10,12 December 2017,It happens when you least expect it,"Beauty in the midst of all the ugliness we're living in, it's like a shock. I wept like I hadn't wept in a movie since I was very young. It made me think and remember summers of my own life. It made remember sounds and smells. I was transported. The smartness, candor and gentleness of this unexpected love story goes beyond anything I've ever seen. Luca Guadagnino is rapidly becoming one my favorite directors working today. Armie Hammer completely demolished my preconceptions with a performance that is total perfection and I haven't mention Timothee Chalamet yet. No I need to dedicate the lasts paragraphs to him because his performance goes beyond perfection. I didn't know him at all. Now I' a fan. It reminded me of the first time I saw Daniel Day Lewis playing a gay punk in ""My Beautiful Launderette"" An explosion of beauty when you least expected. Thank you for that."
3,Call Me by Your Name,10,14 December 2017,Timothee Chalamet,"I cried my eyes out. It was cleansing and reinvigorating. Timothee Chalamet is the living image of a friend from my childhood. He had a similar experience but a very different outcome and it made me think with a broken heart that if my friend had had a father like Elio's father he could have had a real chance at a happy, constructive life, instead of the agonizing pain that he went through. I hadn't though about him for years and Timothee brought him back to me with enormous power. What a beautiful, beautiful performance. Armie Hammer is a total revelation, the perfect foil for a first love. Michael Stuhlbarg introduces us to a character I had never seen on the screen before. He moved me no end, Then, of course, Luca Guadagnino. My hat to you sir. This is a film I will see many times."
4,Call Me by Your Name,10,27 August 2017,"Deeply moving, arousing, heartbreaking","*****This review may contain spoilers!!!!*****I have just finished reading the book. It is deeply moving. I am still in a daze. Heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. The film adaptation is erotic, cinematic, well acted, and painfully beautiful, as Luca Guadagnino's other film, I Am Love (starring the luminous Tilda Swinton). What makes the theme universal? To my eyes, it has to do with the complex issue of love and loss. The film and the book deal with love/loss not in the simple sense of losing the person we love, but in the sense of deliberately losing the person we love so we can sustain loving and desiring the person. ""I can't love you unless I give you up"" could be the line (not from the book or film) that captures the relation between Elio and Oliver. Both Elio and Oliver maintain the minimal distance between them instead of fully committing to their desire 'til the end. Which makes their love the sad kind. As Elio said, ""Time makes us sentimental."" The right time never arrives for Elio and Oliver. They relate to each other from the lenses of the past (""pluperfect"" love, to borrow Elio's wording) and the future. It is never now. The thematic is appealing because it speaks to many of us who have loved and continue to love on the basis of the fundamental loss at the heart of desire. Is there a way out of this spiral? Is there another way of approaching love? These are questions the book and the movie leave the reader/viewer to answer. The ending is unhappy yet ""satisfying"", precisely because this satisfaction involves a mix of hope and agony. It keeps the movement of desire in motion, for both Elio and Oliver, and for the reader/viewer. PS: I can't help but reflect on this great film vis-à-vis Guadagnino's another great film, I Am Love, where the two protagonists literally leave their respective worlds behind to be in a world that they both share."
5,Call Me by Your Name,10,25 August 2017,Sensual Italian summer,"This film is pure sensuality and emotion. You can see through the character's eyes, taste through their mouths but most importantly you feel, by God how you feel. Luca Guadagnino manages to extract the very best out of his actors: Armie Hammer's performance shows unprecedented depth and Timothee Chalamet is the essence of awe inspiring acting, this film will land him an Oscar nomination at the very least."
6,Call Me by Your Name,10,5 October 2017,A masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits,"Call Me By Your Name is the kind of movie that makes you sit through the credits with tears rolling down your face, staring blankly at the screen with a lump in your throat and tightness in your chest. Call Me By Your Name is not a tragic movie. It's not a sad movie. It's not a pretentious movie. It's a movie about love, and love, and love. A beautiful love that will leave you longing to find your own love and drown in it. Timothée Chalamet is an absolute force of nature. Elio will make you want to love, and hurt, and piece yourself back together with absolutely no regrets whatsoever. Elio will make you want to live your life to the fullest. Elio will make you want to break your own damn heart. It's so rare that a performance truly shows the depth of longing, and despair, and passion a character conveys through written words without the internal monologue. Timothée is truly a revelation and his last scene during the credits will have a lasting impact on everyone.Armie Hammer is absolutely brilliant in the way he humanizes Oliver who is somewhat glorified through Elio's lens in the first part of the book. In the movie, Oliver is endearing and human and sexy and caring. He cares for Elio, and his love for him is so tender and so touchingMichael Stuhlbarg's monologue delivered nearing the end of the film is a complete masterpiece, and without a doubt that monologue with be taught and quoted for many years to come. A raw and beautiful scene.Watch this movie. Watch it, and love it, and don't let it fall victim to over-hype. Watch this movie. Fall in love in two hours and twelve minutes, then question every single time you didn't allow yourself to feel just because you were afraid of getting hurt. Was avoiding a possible heartbreak that might have shattered you worth never getting a taste of the heavens? Was killing the potential pain and heartache worth it? Was it worth it?"
7,Call Me by Your Name,10,23 October 2017,"It is about compassion, trust, and wisdom","Chiron, in Barry Jenkins' Oscar-winning film ""Moonlight,"" in addition to being gay and black, has to deal with drug abuse, bullying, and the lack of a supportive home environment. In contrast, in Luca Guadagnino's (""A Bigger Splash"") achingly beautiful Call Me by Your Name, 17-year-old Elio's (Timothée Chalamet, ""Love the Coopers"") life is safe, comfortable, and surrounded by love though, like Chiron, he must come to terms with his true identity. Written by three-time Oscar nominee James Ivory and adapted from the 2007 novel by Andre Aciman, Call Me by Your Name is set in the summer of 1983 where Oliver (Armie Hammer, ""Free Fire"") is an American research assistant studying with art history Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg, ""Steve Jobs"") at Perlman's gorgeous villa in Northern Italy.Oliver arrives at this idyllic setting with its gardens, peach trees, and lakes to greet the professor, his wife Annella (Amira Casar, ""Planetarium"") a lover of German poetry, and his teenage son Elio who speaks several languages and transcribes piano scores for the guitar. Shot by Thai cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom (""Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives"") and buoyed by new songs from Sufjan Stevens, it is easy to feel yourself present in the languid summer afternoon, as Aciman expresses it, ""with the scent of rosemary, the heat, the birds, the cicadas, the sway of palm fronds, the silence that falls like a light linen shawl on an appallingly sunny day."" With Oliver's arrival, Elio now has to shift his focus from pursuing his French girlfriend Marzia (Esther Garrel, ""Daydreams"") to show the American student around town and give him bike tours of the area. Soon, however, he becomes annoyed by the American's brusque manner and his abrupt ""later"" whenever he's leaving. When Elio, who is Jewish, sees Oliver wearing a Star of David on a chain around his neck, however, he finds a common bond, jokingly telling him that his mother considers their family to be ""Jews in discretion."" Sharing the same bathroom, their friendship begins to expand when they engage in conversation and go swimming together. Although Oliver gives Elio a neck massage during a volley ball game, the boy seems unable or unwilling to process the feelings that it brings up in him.When Oliver causally tells Elio that he seems to know everything, the teenager confesses that he knows everything except ""what really matters."" Even when physical intimacy is established, there is the sense that they hold back from fully expressing their feelings and even prefer not to talk about them. Chalamet, in his first leading role, is a revelation, delivering a deeply affecting performance that shows great promise. Hammer's performance is restrained, but also fully believable, making sure that the age difference does not get in the way of the honest and genuine relationship they have established. As they strengthen their friendship, like lovers, their identities blend into each other and they express it verbally by taking each other's name. Call Me by Your Name is not an ""us versus them"" movie. There are no antagonists in the film. It is a celebration of love in all its wonder and mystery.There is gay sex in the movie but, like ""Moonlight,"" it is about more than sex. As Guadagnino says, ""it is about compassion, trust, and wisdom."" All three of these values are expressed in the conversation between Elio and his dad, an interchange that is moving and wise. Though the film is ""gay-themed,"" Guadagnino does not pigeonhole the characters into familiar categories and his refusal to deal in stereotypes or manufactured emotion gives the film the space to breathe and reach the place where tension can grow. Like ""Moonlight,"" Call Me by Your Name has a universal appeal and can touch anyone, gay or straight, who has ever felt the confused and conflicting longings of first love, or who knows from experience that, in the words of the song ""Plaisir d'amour,"" ""The joy of love is but a moment long. The pain of love endures the whole life long."""
8,Call Me by Your Name,10,5 October 2017,"An Extraordinary, Extraordinarily Unforgettable Masterwork of Filmmaking","I loved ""A Bigger Splash"" (the previous film by Luca Guadagnino,) and was in awe by the trailer and stunning reviews for this film. Needless to say, my expectations were utterly shattered by this powerful, emotional, and gorgeous drama. It's one of the best films of the decade, and clearly the best film of the year so far.While this isn't the type of film with too many spoilers, I still don't want to give too much away. It's better to go into such a sublime film like this knowing less rather than more. What I will say is that the main plot concerns an adolescent man who is spending a summer in the 1980's with family in Lombardy, Italy. He begins having a relationship with an older man invited as a guest by the family played by Armie Hammer. The film's pacing is superb and lets the viewer genuinely meet these characters, who are bonded by both friendship and physical affection. This is clearly shown throughout the movie, as the chemistry between the two leads is excellent.But what makes ""Call Me By Your Name"" such a phenomenal film is its gripping sense of feeling. Viewers truly feel that they are away from where they are viewing the film, and truly feel like they have been transported to 1980's Italy. Guadagnino is a masterpiece at eliciting senses, and the audience's sense of senses are used to full effect to simulate the true feelings of being in Italy. From luscious depictions of peaches and apricots grown in the countryside, to the streets in gorgeous Italian towns and the steamy espresso, every sight and sound in the film feels truly authentic and impactful on the viewer. I have not seen such an effective use of reflecting on audiences' senses to create a more immersive viewing experience in a film in years. The film's score is exceptional as well. It feels authentically Italian and beautifully emotional, especially when paired with the film's script in many scenes. The writing feels both authentic and intelligent at all times, and the film doesn't even manage to let its guard down in a single scene by failing to grip the viewer with its beautiful script. A late-film monologue by Michael Stuhlbarg is a particular highlight.As one can see from reading this review, this film is truly unforgettable and a brilliant trip to Italy. Its immersion in its setting and characters remind us of the focal point of cinema: to expose the viewer to unique settings and opportunities and to transport them to these opportunities through the language of film. Recommended to the highest degree. 10/10"
9,Call Me by Your Name,5,18 November 2017,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this film. I read the book when it came out; I am a gay man; I love films about love relationships between beautiful men; I love films with bits of European languages and lovely European settings; I am 'pro' art house films which are all about characters and take their time. But this didn't work. Firstly, it was really too long. But my main problem was that the relationship between Elio and Oliver just didn't ring true. OK, a few small things happened between them which could have been seen as sexual (e.g. the shoulder massage), but they were both busy doing things with women a lot. Nothing wrong with being bi! And Elio is meant to be young, finding himself etc. But one day, he suddenly says to Oliver that he needs to tell him something, and Oliver says he knows what it is - but there really hasn't been enough evidence of that building up. I do realise that reading an article about Hammer which said that he had a clause added to his contract restricting the amount of sex and nudity he would be expected to do - well that made me struggle to see sincerity in his acting. Chalumet on the other hand is a great discovery. The way he holds a close-up all through the closing titles, showing a range of emotions, is very impressive indeed. I can remember so clearly what it was like at 17 (OK yes, 50 years ago) to kind of enjoy feeling sad and then elated about love and sex, and Chalumet shows that brilliantly. But he is not enough to save this film, and nor is the man playing his father, who does such an excellent job of channelling Robin Williams."
10,Call Me by Your Name,10,31 October 2017,Perfection,"Simply put: the best film I've ever seen. This production with a stellar cast and tremendous director and producers have made, through my eyes a perfect film. The characters are engaging, the emotions are raw and palpable. However, the chemistry between all the actors, are truly magnificent. You can relate, extraordinarily to the characters and the storyline of a first love and the trepidation you feel when telling someone how you feel and not knowing whether that will be reciprocated. Timothée and Armie have done a tremendous job in depicting honest and raw emotions and feelings and love that translate with audiences of any nationality and transcend barriers like no other film before it. This is the best film I have ever seen and highly recommend you view."
11,Call Me by Your Name,10,6 November 2017,Stunning,"It is not often that films adapted from books capture the true essence, emotion and spirit of the book but for me Call Me By Your Name does just that. Superbly acted by a talented cast the film was a visual an emotional delight. Sensitively directed and beautifully shot with a great sound track what was not to like. For me it was a coming of age love story for Elio and something very special for Oliver. Simply calling it a gay movie does it a disservice. It is much, much more than that. While the whole cast were strong the two leads, Armie, and Timothee just had that magic on screen. And Timothee Chalamet's performance was stunning absolutely stunning. His closing scene will become a cinema classic. Don't be put off by the gay tag this is a beautiful love story, sensitively told that surly anybody can empathise with. Don't miss it."
12,Call Me by Your Name,10,23 September 2017,Sensual Beauty,"The most sensually immersive film you will see all year, perhaps all decade. The performances from the cast - notably Hammer, Stuhlbarg and particularly newcomer Chalamet put this film in another league from all other recent coming-of-age films and romance films. You leave this film wishing you could stay in the world it has enveloped you within."
13,Call Me by Your Name,3,4 December 2017,Call It By Its Name: 'Dead Boring',"This is the kind of film that you see in 'Coming Attractions' and you think that though it sounds interesting enough to see, it will never live up to its hype. And still you go see it. And yet, even though you knew the buzz for the film was overblown, you are even more disappointed upon leaving the theater than you were prepared to be. This is sub-mediocre cinema for the pretentious mass of moviegoers.For one thing, it was way too long, at least a half hour more than necessary. Too many wasted, extended shots that did nothing to advance the paper-thin narrative of Vulnerable Younger Man Elio falls for Manipulative Young Man Oliver, involving themselves in a six-week summer fling with full parental approval. Oliver has his peach and eats it too, then moves back to the United States to proceed with his pre-planned heterosexual lifestyle. Elio is then left to pine and yearn and mourn with a beautiful sad-face through the closing credits. Two hours and ten minutes for this? No thank you, sirs.About the performances: Armie Hammer is a truly beautiful physical specimen of a man, but in this film that is the full extent of his acting ability. Preening, with an exaggerated sense of dismissive cool, his portrayal of Oliver left the sense of an actor trying too hard to pretend that he was comfortable in the role. This sense is re-inforced in the promotional interviews for the film, where he seems to be working just a bit too hard to show how cool he was with kissing and simulating sex with another beautiful young(er) man. The utter sterility of the sex scenes or the lack of explicit nudity, however, as dictated by Hammer's contract, belie his overcompensating demeanor. Understandable, perhaps, but this kills the credibility of any emotional chemistry beyond the two men on- screen.Timothée Chalamet, on the other hand, is remarkable in the way he inhabits his role, with a kittenish physicality, all lean, wiry lines and lithe angles, that more than holds its own in the scenes with Hammer. Despite the unbelievability of any emotional connection between the two characters, Chalamet's Elio gives a palpable sense of physical attraction to the older Oliver, a man-crush that gives way to physical yearning. The depth of Chalamet's performance was what carried the film, and was by far the most interesting, successful aspect of the production. The novel could actually be interesting, but as brought to screen it was diffuse, dissolute, and disparate; like a collage attempting to depict a mosaic of a mural. This film will get praise for dealing with a sensitive subject, and I suppose that is fair enough; I only wish it had been more interestingly and convincingly executed."
14,Call Me by Your Name,10,5 November 2017,Magnificent!,"This film is magnificent in every respect. Timothee turns in an amazing and memorable performance as Elio. Armie is equally good. I hope that this amazing film garners the Oscar attention that it deserves. There are many powerful, yet quiet, scenes in this film. The last ten minutes of the film are powerful, and who knew that a great scene would unfold before your eyes as the credits roll. Watch this."
15,Call Me by Your Name,4,28 November 2017,A coy same sex puppy love during summer,"Adapted for the screen by James Ivory, Egypt-born Andre Acimen's 'Call me by your name' has already been nominated for countless awards as best picture, best actor or best supporting actor if not best screenplay or best director.The setting is summer, 1983, somewhere in Northern Italy. The camera of director Luca Guadagnino captures wonderfully the luxuriant landscape of place rich lush in greenery, water flowing with abandon in streams and pools; the air is light and bright with sunlight.Guadagnino's camera eye is on Arcadia: poetic in images as he evokes a poetic fantasy, a pastoral paradise, and at any minute, we expect the Greek god Pan to gambol and frolic with abandon.The cinematic ambiance is thus set to arouse gratification of the senses esthetically and more especially sexuallyof a highly passionate kind.The Perlman family welcomes a summer intern from America, Oliver (Arnie Hammer), to help Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) with his research in Greco-Roman culture.The Perlmans are Italian Jews who wear Judaism discreetly, no outward distinguishing them from their neighbors. There is Arnella (Amira Casar) wife and mother, an accomplished linguist from whose lips fall Italian, French, English and German. And Elio (Timothee Chalamet) a precocious boy musically gift, speaks Italian, French and English effortlessly, and to whom girls are attracted. And it is not without a sense of irony that Arnella quotes and translate Goethe who in his letters and poetry had his own love affair with Italy, as a traveler from abroad. The stage is set for the Sturm und Drang of a short love affair.And into this household Oliver enters , for Elio, like a summer storm, aroused as he sexually from quiescent desires he never knew.Oliver wears his Judaism openly, as the gold Star of David he wears around his neck, as easily as he wears his privileged self-assurance as an American. Carefree, he mingles effortlessly; flirts with no physical exertion with women and is larger than life mixing with the village men who drink and play cards, He is a graduate student preparing for medical school and in a sense, internship with the Perlmans is his last taste of youthful freedom.Elio instantly drawn to Oliver slowly discovers that Oliver casts his desires on Elio with an intensity Elio has for Oliver. And into this garden of Eden that Guadagnino that creates for a summer affair between the 24-year old American and the 17-year-old Italian.A bittersweet love that declares itself in the cool mountain springs, the verdant hills of Northern Italy and in the bed.The pursuit and enjoyment of physical pleasure is fostered by a tolerant, cosmopolitan ambiance that dwells in the Perlman family. It is further accentuated by the father's passion for Greco-Roman art, as well as the discovery in a lake of a Roman copy modeled on the muscular nude body of Hermes of the greatest 4-centurry BCE sculptor Praxiteles in all its grace and its raw masculinity.And this theme is an echo of the love physical and romantic Elio shares with Oliver.Summer's over; Oliver leaves never to return. Elio confesses to his father his affair with Oliver. And the professor admits that he and Elio's mother suspected all along the passion Elio had for Oliver, and more to the point he and Arnella tacitly approved as Elio sexually awakens.Professor Perlman confession may win Stuhlbarg a nomination for best supporting actor; he acknowledges to his son that he too knew a similar passion he himself stifled as a youth. (Does this explain his own youthful suffering in the study of Greek art that his son has lived in his love for another man?) Oliver telephones during Hannukah, the Jewish festival of lights commemorating the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem after its defilement by Persians.A small festival of renewal and Elio takes it as a fanning the embers of Oliver's love for him. It's not for Oliver will marry soon and never return.The camera catches Elio crying silently before a blazing winter fireplace, realizing the Oliver was sowing his wild oats and has in his mid-twenties has conformed to the social and sexual norms of heterosexuality, even though he calls Elio by his own name and Elio responds with Oliver.Elio feels betrayed and the lights of Hannukah cast a long shadow of a sadness and sorrow and a finality. As the camera fades, we know Elio with bear existentially a deep scar that will never heal as long as he lives.Overall, esthetically 'Call me by your name' is wonderfully cinematic. Sensuous and sensual in the way its capture nature's seductiveness and the passions that it can arouse in man or woman. And in this manner, it is profoundly romantic in nature. And may very well earn the accolade of 'new classic' and among the very best films.And yet, Hammer and Chalamet as Oliver and Elio are the least attractive and sexually appealing protagonist. The spark and fire between them is absent. Would other actors portrayed these two characters better, we cannot say. The die was cast when they were chosen, but they remain spiritually and emotionally empty."
16,Call Me by Your Name,3,13 November 2017,"Way, way too long and unengaging","Some very strange scores going on with IMDb at the moment. Four of us went to see this yesterday, two were gay and the other two very liberal lefties, so our distaste was not for reasons I can imagine other people would hate this film.Three of us found this incredibly slow, far too long and were aching for it to finish.They even managed to totally misjudge when to end the film. The one truly moving moment was a conversation with father and son that was powerful and brilliant, but they had to carry the film on even longer with yet more slow and inconsequential scenes. Very dull indeed."
17,Call Me by Your Name,2,4 January 2018,Too long and dull,This takes place in 1983 Italy. 17 year old Elio (Tinothee Chalmet) meets 24 year old Oliver (Armie Hammer) who's there to help Elio's archaeological father catalog his findings. Elio and Oliver discover they're in love but what can they do? VERY slow-moving gay romance. It moves at a snails pace and gets real boring real quick. Also Chalmet and Hammer are terrible actors. Even worse their characters are obnoxious jerks and you don't care about either one. I seriously considered walking out a few times! However the ending had two very effective moments that had me in tears. Still you have to sit through 2 hours + of boring melodrama to get to it. Not recommended.
18,Call Me by Your Name,3,13 November 2017,Gay pride agitprop or idyllic gay escapist fantasy romance? You decide!,"Luca Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name is the third in a trilogy which includes A Bigger Splash, a decent potboiler of sorts also set in Italy and starring English speaking actors. The film is based on the 2007 novel of the same name by André Aciman. James Ivory (of Merchant/Ivory fame) wrote the screenplay.The story is set in the early 80s and is superficially reminiscent of Bergman's ""Through a Glass Darkly""; both films deal with 17 year olds hunkered down with their families at summer retreats. That's basically where the comparison ends. Minus, Bergman's adolescent protagonist not only must resolve his relationship with a distant father, but also address the haunting and troubling split he feels between mind and body. On the other hand, Guadagnino's 17 year old, the Italian-American (and Jewish) Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a fledgling composer and music transcriptionist student, suffers from no Bergmanesque qualms of the psyche. Instead, it's all about issues revolving around his sexuality; specifically, his affection for Oliver (Armie Hammer), one of Elio's archaeologist father's (24 year old) research assistants, who shows up as an invited guest of Elio's parents for a six week stay at their very comfy villa in the North Italian countryside.A number of critics are so enamored with Oliver (i.e. Hammer) that they liken him to the Greco-Roman sculptures he's studying under the tutelage of Professor Perlman. There's a mildly interesting excursion that Oliver takes with the good Professor where an ancient statue is dredged up from the ocean and Oliver has some fun playing around with the statue's truncated arm. Much less interesting is seeing Elio enraptured as Oliver eats a soft-boiled egg with the yolk gushing out as this is supposed to be some kind of big sensual event. Ditto for Elio's attempt at self-gratification by slowly sucking on a peach. This is a film that is virtually devoid of conflictunless you consider Elio's inner confusion as to whether he really wants to get involved with the older guy as a mark of some kind of tension or (dare I use the word?suspense). In the end the suspense amounts to the consummation of the couple's physical relationship and how unerotic that moment is (Guadagnino cuts away to a tree, seen from the bedroom window!). Jordan Raup writing in ""The Film Stage"" somehow is impressed by the ""mutual yearning"" of Elio and Oliver. He cites the scene of their visit to the local town, with Elio informing Oliver that this is the site of one of the most deadly battles of World War I. Instead of a complex interplay between conflicting personalities, Raup settles for an idyllic image of a gay romancelikening this inconsequential dalliance to the passion of soldiers involved in a life and death struggle: ""In an unbroken shot, they walk around opposite sides of the historic site, revealing as few words as possible about their heart's desires. In between this division there's the history of thousands of lives that have been lost, each with their own burning passions."" What crap!Worse yet is how the critics ignore the fact that this is an underage boy being taken advantage by an adult. The age of consent might be lower in Italy, but it still seems highly inappropriate that a research assistant is trying to have sex with a juvenile right under the eyes of the boss's father. But Peter Dubruge writing in Variety seems to be alright with all this. He acknowledges that ""this seductive outsider correctly anticipates that anything physical that might happen between him and Elio will have a lasting impact on the young man's sexual identity."" But Debruge seems to be impressed by how ""the pair brazenly peacock for one another, parading around shirtless and leaving the doors to their shared bathroom ajar  an improvised mating ritual echoed by a low insect buzz that fills the soundtrack."" Debruge describes the relationship as a ""deliciously tentative courtship dance""instead of what it's legally referred to in the United States today: statutory rape.In a sense, Guadagnino doesn't really have to offer up a narrative replete with both multi-dimensional characters and conflict. Instead, the ""courtship dance,"" the lugubrious exchange of intimate gestures, appears to be a reaction formation to gay bashing. The idyllic picture of intimacy between gay lovers is designed to reassure the public that gay people are not only capable of great intimacy, but are entitled to it. Despite Guadagnino's denial that Call Me By Your Name is not a ""gay"" picture, it fulfills its function as a propaganda (or agitprop if you will) for the gay pride movement.This is borne out by the Elio's permissive father who goes way out on a limb with a long-winded speech to his son, approving of his sexual experimentation with the older partner. The morality is questionable given the ages of the parties involved, but the bigger offense is an aesthetic one: where is the conflict? The father approves, the ""boys"" are ""hot"" for one another, and despite the wistful, melancholy ending marked by the end of Oliver's vacation (and subsequent call to Elio with the news that he's getting married), nothing much happens between the principals at all. Unless of course a beautiful Hallmark Greeting card is your idea of compelling, realized cinema!"
19,Call Me by Your Name,3,26 December 2017,I dont understand,"I watched this movie yesterday very excited because of the previous comments.
It was boring, superficial, with only one interesting scene (the father one). Too late, after 1 and a half hour. Musicians and archaeologists moving around saying nothing fun, wise, clever.... Pufff."
20,Call Me by Your Name,2,15 November 2017,Someone needs smoking lessons,Apart from being distracted by the mother obviously having never havinvg smoked a cigarette in her life (couldn't someone have coached her?)....the acting was good. The scenery was very nice...but the story was dull. If you watch the first 10 minutes and aren't interested....bail out. It doesn't get better.I stopped watching after 1 and a half hours. The other 2 people with me agreed.I never read the book. I'm wondering if all the 10/10 reviews are for the book. not the film. I really tried to like the film but I couldn't.
21,Call Me by Your Name,3,27 December 2017,So Bad.,"No story line.
Can't help but wonder how many people would be writing ""Perfection"" if it was just a boring hetro couple?
Cinematography and scoring only redeeming features + old mans speech at the end.
Can't believe I just wasted 2.5hrs of my life."
22,Call Me by Your Name,1,22 December 2017,Too long and boring.,I found this film rather emotionally unengaging. I was very aware that the characters were acting and that I was being manipulated. This film felt smug and self-congratulatory. I thought Armie Hammer was too old for the part. I didn't like the way in which the girlfriends were reduced to bit parts and foils with no real existence of their own. Ditto the housekeeper.I loved Moonlight and one of my all time favorite films is Brokeback Mountain so gay love is no barrier at all for me. This film verged on pretentious.
23,Call Me by Your Name,2,23 December 2017,Agonisingly Boring and Pretentious.,"Ratings here for this movie are a joke. The first 20 ratings are 10 out of 10 with absurdly over the top praise. Really? Someone was paid to write them maybe? or the crew organised a ratings campaign. This movie was above all, slow and boring. I quickly lost all interest in any of the characters. One pointless scene after another. At the time Elio had sex with the peach, I googled the length of the movie and realised there was another 30 minutes of this 132 minutes of tripe to suffer through. I couldn't face it and four of us walked out. Oh and unless it was in the last 30 minutes, the morality of a much older man fooling around with the 17 year son while staying in the house of his colleague was not addressed? Was this romanticising casual sex with children? Kind of creepy. Not a patch on Brokeback Mountain. Far more interesting, way more depth and nuance, far better acting."
24,Call Me by Your Name,9,24 September 2017,"A ""special friendship"" in picturesque Italy.","This film is set in 1983, in a vacation home in northern Italy. 17- year-old Elio's father, an archaeology professor, brings in a research assistant, hunky 24-year-old Oliver. With their shared Jewish heritage and Elio's responsibility to play host, they fall in love, though for a while they miss each other's signals. The father recognizes the ""special friendship"", and arranges an excuse to keep them together a little while longer, mentioning that he had a similar relationship in his youth.This film has gorgeous photography of small-town Italy, with a well- acted plot."
25,Call Me by Your Name,1,30 December 2017,PHONY !!!,This movie tries to show beautiful people in beautiful settings experiencing beautiful emotions. Unfortunate for those of us who prefer movies depicting real people in real settings feeling real emotions.
26,Call Me by Your Name,4,26 December 2017,"It is not a pedophile movie, don't be ridiculous, but it is not a masterpiece.","I have watched this film on two different levels. First is like a sugary-water romantic coming of age film and second is like a youth-fetishistic film. I have enjoyed the first level, although it is a bit to long with many unnecessary scenes. I don't see the reason of mentioning the partizans and second WW, and lots of the scenes seem too staged. From the discussion about old german tale to the father's speech near the end. But, still if you watch this film like a light romantic movie seen through the eyes of Elio you will be OK. 
But, if you want to dig deeper, you are entering some murky waters. Oliver is not very clear character. We don't know from the beginning if he is gay, bi or straight. We assume he is straight, he is going out with the girl and doesn't show any interest for Elio. Because of that it can be interpreted that his sexual feelings are awakened intellectually, through the archaeological findings and slides of Greek sculptures of ambiguous young boys and the speech about them which Elio's father is telling to Oliver like some kind of incite for Oliver to go after Elio. This interpretation would be more interesting to me than later revelation that he was attracted to Elio from the start. Oliver is then just a character who is attracted to younger boys. I don't mean pedophile! He doesn't discover his homosexuality in the proces of friendship with Elio, but he is determined from the start. He is the type of men who are attracted only to the youth. He is not interested in men, just young boys. Later, after summer is finished he goes back to his heteronormative life with the future wife to be. For him Elio is just a summer escapade, although he behaved very well and wise towards Elio. He is not a bad guy.But author's films are not abut the characters anyway, they are about authors themselves. They choose themes which are closer to them and this movie is therefore a proclamation of fetichism towards youth. Nothing wrong with that. That is a legitimate theme. Only I didn't liked the manipulation and bypassing of it, camouflaging it with the coming of age theme. Father's monolog to Elio near the end confirms that youth fethisism assumption. 
""When you get older no one will look at you, let a lone touch you"" said father to Elio, and he also confess that he had romance with the man in his youth. Unfulfilled and therefore cemented like a fetish towards youth in his older days. This is why he envies Elio and why he is so encouraging for their affair. Not because his libertarian, educated and therefore open minded stance. 
""Does mother knows?"" asks Elio. ""No"" replies father. We are not sure if he asks about his own affair with the Oliver or father affair in the past, but judging from the mother's behaviour through the whole movie it can be assumed that this question refers to the father's past. He is not open towards his own openminded wife. He keeps his youth affair like a secret. Allowing therefore this secret to develop in to a fetish. And to conclude, I didn't like the end scene, that forced tear jerker. It is like they wanted us to feel something in this too pretentious and too staged movie. Off course you will cry if you see someone crying and suffering for 5 minutes if you have any empathy in yourself. Manipulations like that, plus too much unnecessary parts in the movie are not features of good directors. Maybe in the future Luca Guadagnino will develop his crafts better but till then I will give this film 4 stars."
27,Call Me by Your Name,,9 December 2017,Luca Guadagnino's tender film fills the senses,"Luca Guadagnino is one of our most sensual filmmakers. CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, like his previous A BIGGER SPLASH and I AM LOVE are filled with scenes touching upon all the senses. Guadagnino gorgeously captures images of beautiful objects, locations, books and, of course, the pleasures of the flesh. His soundtracks are filled with the sounds of nature as well as overflowing with music (usually classical, but, with more modern nods to the Rolling Stones and the Psychedelic Furs). His characters luxuriate with the smells of food and they caress the world around them.It is within that world that screenwriter James Ivory (adapting André Aciman's novel) places our main characters seventeen year old Elio (Timothy Chalamet) and twenty-something Oliver (Armie Hammer). Every year, Elio's parents Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Anella (Amira Casar) invite a research assistant to their idyllic villa in Northern Italy. In 1983, that person is Oliver, an American who sweeps into town with his good looks and cool persona. Oliver simultaneously attracts the attention of the ladies in town - as well as Elio. Complicating matters is that Elio is also having a summer romance with a young Parisian Marzia (Esther Garrel).While on the surface, this may seem like a simple potboiler, Ivory, Guadagnino and the cast gracefully ease the audience into the tale. The film takes full advantage of the 132 minute run-time. Nothing is hurried. No shortcuts taken. The emotions are given time to build organically. It's like a lovely concerto that plays out to its own meter. The pacing may be too languid for those who demand a more forceful drama, but, CALL ME is a film to soak in. To luxuriate within. The subtext and the atmosphere not only inform the main story, they become part of it. By the time Elio and Oliver's infatuation is consummated, you have fully invested in them.CALL ME is deliberately set in the early 80s - just as AIDS was becoming a concern, and, of course, long before coming out was accepted. And, some may find the idyllic setting a bit too perfect. Hammer's performance is a bit too flat at the beginning, but, pays off as it progresses. Chalamat (also strong in the current LADY BIRD) brings off the extremely difficult task of externalizing what is largely and internalized character - simmering until it boils. Stuhlbarg is largely a background figure for much of the story-line, but, is sterling in one of the film's key scenes. Guardagnino's choices of music is impeccable (including pieces by Bach, Revel and Satie) and Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's 35mm film lensing captures every moment exquisitely.On the surface, a collaboration between a sensualist like Guadagnino and the reserved James Ivory (as in Merchant-Ivory) may seem a bit of a mismatch, but, it works beautifully. Together (with the cast & crew), they have created one of the year's most indelible films."
28,Call Me by Your Name,10,23 October 2017,Summer loving'... had me a blast,"Luca Guadagnino made quite an impression on me as a filmmaker with A Bigger Splash, a film that combined an engaging narrative with some fantastic performances. With his latest film, Call Me by Your Name, Guadagnino certainly has the potential to repeat the trick and deliver more of the same.When Oliver (Armie Hammer), a graduate student, arrives to stay with the family of his professor in northern Italy, he meets Elio (Timothée Chalamet), his professor's son. What follows is a summer full of music, food and romance that will forever change their lives.Rather impressively, Luca Guadagnino follows A Bigger Splash with just as an engaging film however, he shows a much softer hand when dealing with the sensual nature of a film such as Call Me by Your Name. It truly is a beautiful piece of cinema, Guadagnino's direction of the intimate coming-of-age narrative being a real triumph.There's some genuinely fantastic dialogue included in the screenplay written by Guadagnino, James Ivory and Walter Fasano. The subtlety of the comedy is great but it's the poignancy of the words when relationships come into play that will stay with the audience, particularly a moment shared between Elio and his father towards the end of the film. It's silently powerful stuff.Coming to the performances, Call Me by Your Name features two leads in Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer who share such a natural and fitting chemistry. It felt much like that shared between Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara in Carol, effortless and becoming much more impactful as a result. Chalamet in particular has a very bright future ahead of himself. There's also a fine performance from Michael Stuhlbarg as Elio's father to look out for, balancing the comedy and emotion expertly.I expect people to make comparisons between Call Me by Your Name and Moonlight given the nature of their subject matter however, I'd rather not see people try and play them off against one another because they both deserve such high praise. Being in the company of such a film is a major achievement for a film like Call Me by Your Name."
29,Call Me by Your Name,10,19 November 2017,A sensual love story that inflames the heart.,"""Call Me by Your Name"" is an hypnotically beautiful coming of age drama that surpasses the cliché of the 'queer film' as overwrought naval-gazing depression fantasy full of sleazy sex, instead celebrating the intoxicating passion of youthful love with tender sensuality. Set in 1983, it details the sexual awakening of a precocious teenager named Elio, who is besotted with the arrival of a handsome older student, Oliver, who comes to stay at his family's pastoral Italian villa for the summer.As they both lounge listlessly in the sun-drenched Lombardian countryside, swimming and cycling to coffee shops, the first half of the film dances an artful choreography of stolen glances, innuendo and mixed signals as the pair try to work out where the other's feelings lie. When the two finally realize their desire for one another and become lovers, it is with the bittersweet understanding that they must part ways at summer's end, when Oliver returns to America. This is the only real source of tension in the story. Despite Oliver and Elio's discretion in their affair, there is no obvious homophobic backdrop or bullying influence around them. Indeed Elio's cultured, cosmopolitan parents are both very thoughtful and accepting people, even hinting to Elio quite early on that he can speak to them about anything. So how does a film with no major conflict keep us engaged and invested in the relationship? By making us fall in love with it. Luca Guadagnino's entrancing direction lowers the defenses with a languid pace and indulgent cinematography that soothes and seduces. The atmosphere is heady with the carefree exuberance of youth which we so long to experience again. This is the summer we wished we had. At times it seems almost absurdly idyllic; The cynic in me was ready to scoff at the hyper-sophistication of Elio's wealthy, scholarly, multi-lingual family who spend their time discussing politics, citing poetry and transcribing Bach. Elio's teenage friends seem to be comprised of a posse of French and Italian Lacoste models. You might think who could possibly relate to this? Nonetheless I was gradually swept away by the blissful escapism, almost feeling like I was there at times.The cast are all superb. Armie Hammer, while looking a bit older than his character's 24 years, is such a commanding presence as Oliver, with his statuesque good looks and resonant voice. He gives him that strong, confident worldly charm that is so instantly beguiling to young Elio. Michael Stuhlberg and Amira Casar as Elio's parents are benevolent, nurturing forces. But the true standout here is Timothee Chalamet. With his big soulful eyes he navigates all of the complexity of Elio's emergent feelings, imbuing him with a feline sensuality one minute and naive emotional fragility the next.The scenes of sex are not gratuitous, with the director choosing instead to focus on the erotic build up, the playful kissing and teasing, the tender touches. It all feels so honest and natural, two characters just completely being themselves and loving one another for it. I was completely enthralled by Oliver and Elio's relationship, and found myself sad to not have experienced one just like it. I also couldn't help but be sad as I contemplated the tender transience of youth, for which the peach is a symbol. By the time the heartbreaking final scene rolled out I was sobbing, full of nostalgia for my own teenage years, the time I wasted and chances not taken.Go see this film and allow yourself to feel."
30,Call Me by Your Name,1,1 October 2017,2 hour equivalent of an Instagram brunch story,"If you have ever stumbled upon an Insta story of a brunch table with a polo shirt lightly hanged on the brim of the chair, a visibly used Penguin edition of a Thomas Mann roman and a moleskin notebook full of pretentious calligraphy, all serving as props, welcome to Guadanino's world. The characters are moving advertisements of Polo and Lacoste who carry books they have never read as medals, cite snippets of poets they never got and surround themselves in a world of art to boost their shallow egos. Every character of this film is a poor copy of a real life personality: see the professor who is a more handsome, gay friendly version of Umberto Eco. Under all this stylization lies nothing. All the spontaneous action feels terribly staged and you can taste a fear in the air. The fear that if an actor misses one step of this mind numbing choreography, the whole world will crumble. Don't ask me to think highly of a director who dedicates a whole scene to advertise espresso."
31,Call Me by Your Name,3,12 January 2018,"Slow, Pretentious and Emotionally Disconnected","As a producer/director who specializes in gay genre movies, I was eager to see ""Call Me By Your Name"". The positive buzz about it further fueled my anticipation. What a disappointment! Handsome newcomer Timothee Chalamet turned out to be just about the only redeeming feature in an otherwise hollow and artificial waste of time.""Call Me By Your Name"" suffers from numerous fatal flaws: The main characters lack any believable ""chemistry"". Armie Hammer (Oliver) is a horrible actor with as much depth as a cardboard cutout. There is absolutely no effort to explain the attraction Elio has for aloof Oliver and visa versa - it seems to come from nowhere and for no reason. There are hints that each of the two main characters has special talents - intellectual Oliver and musical prodigy Elio - but those scenes seem out of place and contrived with no payoff in the plot. The weird request from which the movie gets it's title is spoken in a scene, but there is no explanation for it. It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. If anyone said to me, ""Call me by your name"" after we just had sex, I'd say ""Later"" (this will be more amusing to those who have seen the movie). I haven't read the book, but the screenplay lacks any kind of conflict, which makes it BORING.The highlights are the beautiful Italian locations and Timothee Chalamet. I wouldn't bother to see it for any other reason."
32,Call Me by Your Name,10,28 October 2017,No film has moved me like this in years,"I am so glad I went to see this film. The acting was superb all around but Timothee Chalamet managed to steal every scene he was in. The final scene, featuring a several minutes long shot of Chalamet was one of the films highlights.The soundtrack was incredible. It really suited the film and set the mood just right. The cinematography was beautiful.No film has moved me like this in years. I walked out of the theatre, into the toilets and cried. Beautiful, heart warming, sensual... If this doesn't win a number of Oscars, I'll scream. Go see it."
33,Call Me by Your Name,10,5 November 2017,One of the Most Beautiful Movies Ever Made,"This movie captures every feeling a teenager can possibly feel within the span of two hours and ten minutes. The music plays into the movie so perfectly to the extent that it would take away from the beauty of it all if the music was different. It's been said before but, without spoilers, the end credits are so overwhelming and emotional. If Timothée Chalamet doesn't win an Oscar for his role as Elio then people will be extremely upset for him, myself included. His work here is undoubtedly the most realistic and truthful performance I have ever seen in my life. Oliver, played flawlessly by Armie Hammer, becomes a counterpart of Elio and it is striking to see the two become so close. This movie does take its time, but it is so natural that it doesn't affect the film's impact whatsoever. Elio and Oliver's chemistry feels so palpable and unscripted. Often in romantic films the script is written so that the characters act or speak in a way that directly and forcibly pulls the heartstrings. With Call Me By Your Name, however, it's as if you are watching a beautiful and giddy relationship unfold in front of your eyes. Every emotion felt by Elio is felt by the audience. The last third will completely drain you of emotion, particularly one scene with Michael Stuhlbarg. Along with the emotion felt while viewing the film, it also manifests your thoughts afterwards and hits you harder and harder as time goes on. Rush to see this as soon as you can; it is not only the best movie this year, but one of the best movies ever made and a timeless classic."
34,Call Me by Your Name,1,28 December 2017,"Bad acting, unrealistic and slow story line","First of all, I want to start from the scene where they say to each other ""Call me by your name."" It was extremely corny and cringy and I had to pause the movie to cringe.Second of all, the story line was too slow and boring and nothing was happening. Third of all, it is a major turn off for me that the actors are straight and they go on every tv show and brag about how straight they are yet ""how good their acting was."" Sorry no. It is disrespectful. If you want to make an LGBT movie, hire actually LGBT actors. This looked like a cheap way to make money.If you want to watch good LGBt movies I highly advice Being 17 and Closet Monster. Don't waste your time with this tacky movie."
35,Call Me by Your Name,10,24 November 2017,My predictions for Call me By your Name - Full Oscar sweep for 2018 - a fantastic film!,"This is not the first movie of its type for there have been many similarly made gay themed films of this caliber. The difference is that Armie Hammer is not in them, and also most of them don't have the muscle of Sony Pictures Classic behind them to push them into recognition. This film is also visually spectacular, stirring and a slow burn into organically immersing you in the world of both Oliver and Elio. Your will want to watch this film several more times after your first time to better digest the beauty of the cinematography, perfect story and acting. It as sweeping movie that you will not soon forget. Expect many Oscar nominations and even a best actor nomination for Armie Hammer. After several days thinking about this film, I remembered another Italian film that I saw that had a very similar premise, albeit a more controversial one called ""The Flavor of Corn"" (Il sapore del grano) Starring Lorenzo Lena as a university student assigned to teach at a remote northern Italian small town. One of his students becomes obsessed with him ""puppy love"". It is controversial and extremely touching at the same time with a heartbreaking ending. A must see if you have are lucky enough to find this film. Its a VERY hard find, but certainly worth the watch."
36,Call Me by Your Name,10,7 November 2017,A Truly Beautiful Piece of Cinema,"This movie is truly beautiful. It is a work of artistic beauty in so many ways and I will enjoy watching it again many times in the future.The movie is slow in pace but this reflects the nature of time in the summer: slow, easy and free- flowing. There is nowhere to be at a specific time, no agenda to meet, just slow summer days and the beauty that comes with being this at ease. I think that is one of the beautiful elements within the film: it reflects this Italian/European lifestyle which perhaps we should all think more seriously about, as what is life when you are constantly rushing to meet this deadline or catch this certain train when you compare it to the life of living out in the rustic countryside, eating fresh fruit and swimming in the local river? I know the film is set in the 80's, but that is not to say people today still do not live like this at least part of the year. Anyway, from someone who has never seen a LGBT based movie before, I felt a bit unprepared and as if I had nothing to compare it to. Although by the end of the film I really didn't feel I needed to as the love story transcends any artificial labels to simply express a pure and innocent tale of first love that is rarely as genuinely portrayed within cinema. I think both Chamalet and Hammer did wonderful jobs in their performances, balancing the innocence and curiosity of Elio with the experience and desire of Oliver. Chamalet in particular, I believe, as a younger actor, brought a great deal of raw emotion into his performance which really enhances the whole film overall. The beautiful landscapes combined with the focus on the Italian lifestyle brings another wonderful element to the film and really helps to complete the story. The symbolism within the film, with the ripe peaches, also builds on the artistic direction of the film that is sure to make it a possible contender for the awards season next year. I certainly hope that the film wins at least for Best Foreign Film, yet I would hope that it would garner wider recognition and very much hope that Chamalet is considered for Best Actor. The speech by Elio's father at the end of the film, played by the talented Mr Micheal Stuhlbarg, is very moving and really has a wonderful message in the end I think that challenges us all to think about how we live our lives and how we judge others."
37,Call Me by Your Name,10,1 November 2017,"Fresh like a fruit, sensual like an Italian summer","Call me by your name is, in my opinion, one of the few, rare films that have the power to deeply move and affect their viewers as if they were watching scenes of real life or perhaps even of their own experiences. This film is so special that it has been stuck in my mind and imagination for many days after the first viewing. I could not resist but watch it a second time, which was in many ways revelatory on the quality of the movie. It is directed by Luca Guadagnino, an incredibly gifted Italian film-maker who has worked on the critically acclaimed 'I am love' and 'A bigger splash'. The artistry and the sense of taste of Guadagnino's cinema are immediately evident in this movie. The screenplay, by James Ivory, is based on the 2007 book by Andre Aciman. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer are incredibly believable and delightfully genuine in their portrayals of Elio and Oliver. Elio is a young man who lives in a gorgeous small town of Northern Italy with his cosmopolitan family during the summer of 1983. Oliver is a handsome American academic who has come to stay at their villa for the summer as a student of Elio's father. Michael Stuhlbarg also offers an incredible performance during the film, playing Elio's sensitive and intellectual father, who faces the reality of his son's sexuality and reaches out to him in one of the most touching and most virtuously written scenes of the past few years. Everything falls smoothly into place and looks astonishingly beautiful, from the luxuriant Italian setting in the town of Crema and around Lake Garda, the carefully picked and elegant costume design, to the crisp and vintage looking photography. Some moments in this movie will probably become cult scenes, like Elio's self sexual discovery through a peach and the conversation taking place between Elio and Oliver in front of a war memorial, where they begin to reveal the feelings they have for each other. This scene is particularly interesting (and is followed by shots of the two cycling through the sun- lit countryside) as the camera moves around the square with no interruptions and observes the discussion without ever getting too close to the characters. It seems like Guadagnino has the talent to reveal his characters' emotions without necessarily having to indulge in close-up shots. Still, when he does, I guarantee it feels pretty magic. The soundtrack also plays a big part in creating the special mood of this film, with two songs performed by Sufjan Stevens. I believe this movie deserves a 10 as it represents all I love about cinema and it casts a magical spell that makes it a little cinema miracle. Everyone should watch it and fall in love with Oliver and Elio!"
38,Call Me by Your Name,1,2 January 2018,Cheap gay fantasy,"There is too many things wrong with the film, too long too boring..."
39,Call Me by Your Name,1,31 December 2017,This is what passes for art?,"Line up a tortoise, a snail, a sloth and this movie for slowest moving thing in Earth and this movie would win hands down. After an hour into it, you'll wonder when it's going to be over.Here's the plotline. A pedophile comes to live with a family in Italy (I think) and befriends the 17-year old son of his employer (who also has latent homosexual tendencies we later find out). But, rather than acting as an adult and telling the child he cannot act upon his advances because IT'S AGAINST THE LAW, he acquiesces and they become lovers (even though the boy seems to be having a randy time with a female interest of his). All this goes on under the roof of his watchful Dad who apparently approves of his vulnerable son being molested by this adult (could he be acting on his own latent desires). Apparently, we learn later that the mother of the boy is clueless and encourages them to take a trip together because they've become such close ""friends."" Um, Dad, now's you're time to step up and throw this NAMBLA member out of your house...oh wait, you're actually going to encourage it?You people that are calling this a classic or a brilliant coming of age story should have your heads examined. Are you jumping on the chic bandwagon because all your bohemian friends are and you want to look cool too? Let's call it like it is. If I could give zero stars for this movie, I would, but at least the music deserves one star. This was a disgusting movie that played out over a torturous two hours. It has zero redeeming qualities."
40,Call Me by Your Name,,26 November 2017,Near masterful,"It's hard to put into words exactly the way I felt watching this film. Hours later it's hard to even begin to write my opinion on it. To put as simply as I can, the film perfectly captures its setting and atmosphere in a way few films do. The biggest credit needs to be given to director Luca Guadagnino, who is able to capture the smallest of details. Technically, the film is a marvel and I struggle to think of one flaw. It's beautiful, sensual, luscious in its execution, with absolutely marvelous pacing. In terms of pure directorial achievements, it's definitely one of the best of the year. The performance of Timothée Chalamet is also a pretty perfect portrayal of the character in the novel, and a completely internal performance that is reminiscent of Rooney Mara's wonderful work in Carol. Armie Hammer is also quite strong in the role, although it's a tricky character to get completely right. The novel is told completely through Elio's eyes and so we only imagine and see Oliver from a distance. He's more of an enigmatic figure in the novel than a real, tangible person. So much of that is due to the writing and the way Elio sees him as, so in terms of difficulty, I can imagine how Hammer had quite a task on his hands. Due to the literal nature of film, it's a type of character that always had to lose some of its mystery to its translation from the page, and it's as good one as can be. I have so much I want to say about this but still can't find the right words, but the one thing I will say is that while the story here is pretty simple, the film really does capture, more than any other in recent memory, the feeling of that fleeting force of love and passion that can come to define one's life. It does so in a melancholic, beautiful way that makes it stand out from others of its kind. I can see why some people wouldn't take to it (and in fact the almost-unanimous positive reviews surprise me) because at the end of the day, the technical aspects work to create a film that can only be defined by a feeling that some people will experience watching the film and that others won't. All that sounds incredibly enigmatic, but it's a difficult feeling to pinpoint and considering the film, I think it's fitting."

42,Call Me by Your Name,9,9 November 2017,An Atmospherc and Beautiful Summer Romance,"A sensual romance about a boy who finds himself through the discovery of another.Luca Guadagnino's third chapter in his desire trilogy, following I am Love (2009) and A Bigger Splash (2015) is Call Me By Your Name, a novel arbitrary love tale between two young men in the shimmering summer of 80s Italy. A romantic drama pealing back the layers of its Romeo and ""Juliet"" in a elementary yet bewildering fashion.In the 80s suburban Italy, 17 year old Elio ( Timothée Chalamet) and his parents unwind for their summer lounge, when Oliver (Armie Hammer) a 24 year old academic arrives at the families home to work along side Elio's father Lyle (Michael Stuhlbarg). While Elio's first impressions of the strapping American are sower, Elio's enchantment with Oliver blossoms a beautiful friendship between the two and then as the drama proceeds a romantic one.Guadiagnio's vision of a summer love affair is one to truly be admired by the way Call Me By Your Name eases you into a conceivable relationship. Instead of your traditional love at first sight films. Call Me By Your Name has the confidence to take its time with the characters to produce a remarkable layered character journey. From this we are given the perspective of Elio's world and his flourishing growth as young man, before his world is truly altered by his contact with Oliver. The film is more a coming age of story of Elio as well as a romance.Obviously the coursing heartbeat of the film is the central characters relationship as it blossoms from the very start to finish, an amazing master work in romantic story telling to say the least. As Elio and Oliver converse over music, philosophy and archaeology, the two's connection is thickened in the company of each other, and of us the audience as well. This is wonderfully transcribed in James Ivory's script beautifully adapted from André Aciman's book. Although Elio is our main window into this romance, both characters are as equal as each other, as the title implies.Real masters giving life to this tale is the cast themselves. A fabulous ensemble performance by all participants in a warm welcoming environment, usually found unfamiliar in this narrative context. From Michael Stuhlbarg's wise Lyle passionate about his love of archaeology that he shares with Oliver, while also being a passionate father to Elio guiding him in his journey as a youth. Armie Hammer's Oliver is scene stealing charming puzzle which along side Elio we are trying to unravel. Hammer brings forth an exceptional performance which is already ringing potential Oscar bells. Although those bells better be ringing louder for the true standout performance of Timothée Chalamet. Chalamet brings a marvellous collection of young but also mature character in Elio trying to decipher his own identity which becomes all the more clear when he meets Oliver. A major break out performance hopefully to set Chalamet on the path of even greater work.What moulds Call Me By Your Name is its glistening flavour is its exotic summer presence in honourable landscape beauty of Italy, tenderly caught by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's cinematography. A strong throwback to the hot summer just gone, as we now enter the cold winter. A lavish film in its own right, seriously a film to really immerse in with its exotic atmosphere while, pouring its heart out in the characters.Call Me By Your Name is the most remarkable drama of the year, if you believe in any love story this year let it be this one, as your swept in a fantastic voyage of discovering love for the first time. Truly a masterpiece in romantic story-telling."
43,Call Me by Your Name,8,1 November 2017,Summer of gay love,"After years of famine this is feast year for gay picture-goers: two gay love stories in two months. Scripted by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME has all the rich texture and subtlety of a 'classic' Merchant-Ivory production. It's 1983 and 17-year-old Elio Perlman (Timothee Chalamet) is spending the summer at his parents' house in Northern Italy. A hunky American graduate (Arnie Hammer) arrives to help his professor father with archaeological research. Elio develops a crush on the charismatic Oliver who, reluctantly at first, reciprocates. A summer of intense passion is bound to have a short lease as Oliver has to go back to the States.The two leads give deeply felt performances and the spirit of the 1980s  musically and morally  is delicately evoked. Elio's dad (Michael Stuhlbarg, a near double for Robin Williams), supportive and non-judgmental, is the dad any gay teenager would yearn to have.Cinematography and the music score are superb. At two and a quarter hours the movie is a tad too long and slow to take off, but the intensity of this love story exceeds GOD'S OWN COUNTRY and is very much the equal of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The mood reminded me very much of Joseph Losey's THE GO-BETWEEN (1971). A movie not to be missed."
44,Call Me by Your Name,9,30 December 2017,Hauntingly beautiful....,"I seen this movie last night to a sold out audience who were also mesmerized. I don't even know where to begin. The lead actor was so wonderful he deserves the Oscar for this achingly wonderful, sad and every emotional we have had as a 17 year old boy. I came out in the early eighties and was very young and this movie reminded me of a love I had and lost and the pain never totally goes away. All of the emotions I had were on the screen. I could smell the grass, the water, the flowers, the fruit. This director WOW you are great ! I heard there will be a sequel. I cant wait to see these characters again. Armie you give your best performance yet I have been following you since the show Reaper. You are beautiful and gave a Oscar winning performance but lastly the father talking to his son about acceptance had the audience and I in tears. He should also be recognized. What a Dad! This is not just a Gay movie. It is a beautiful real love story with characters that will haunt you in wonderful ways.Bravo!"
45,Call Me by Your Name,9,4 January 2018,"A slow, cautious beginning, which leads to a monumental ending.","The beginning and the middle of the movie, ""Call Me by Your Name"", seemed slow, and as if the movie had no purpose except for two guys falling in love -- which we have seen before in plenty of independent films; however, the ending made the movie come together in a monumental way. In particular, the ending was made up of some of the most profound dialogues -- for example, the dialogue between the main character and his father -- I've seen on film, which would not have made sense without the slow, realised progression of the main characters' love. Similarly, the main character wasn't very expressive of his inner emotions throughout the beginning and the middle of the film; however, the very last scene showed the acting chops of Timothée Chalamet - he, without any words, only in his eyes, reflected on the events of the entire film, which gave the audience an opportunity to connect the cautious beginning and middle of the movie to this profound ending. Masterful."
46,Call Me by Your Name,10,4 January 2018,Exquisite and Fascinating,"I do not think I have ever enjoyed a film so much! Being a 17 year old myself, the character of Elio really inspired me; he inspired me that it very well is better to speak than to die. This film beautifully portrayed the slow burning of a love between teenager Elio, and graduate student Oliver. I love that it was slow at first, it really went into depth of their lives in Northern Italy, it made me feel like I was right there, living with them. The film was shot so nicely, it focused on the small details of everything, nothing was just left in the background; everything added to the atmosphere of the story. I now feel like I have been to Italy, and I now want to visit again, but for real this time.The way everything happens in the film, I just adore so much. I love their relationship, they care so much for one another, as to why when they part at the train station, it is so utterly heart-wrenching. The cracking of Elio's voice while he is on the phone with his mother gets me every time- I have watched the film three times now, and I do not plan on stopping there. Overall, I have to say, the book was perfectly adapted into this film. There may have been some things not included from the novel, but some of those things are just hard to include in a movie, which I understand. One of the things I loved most, as did everyone else I am sure, was Mr. Perlman's speech towards the ending, to Elio. It really opened my eyes up, so wide, that I started crying because everything that he was saying was so beautifully said and it inspired me to already start living my life differently. I have never felt this much emotion from a film, ever, and that is what I love most about it."
47,Call Me by Your Name,10,28 October 2017,"Breaking New Ground, FINALLY some Nuance","It is absolutely refreshing to see someone trying something NEW, INNOVATIVE, and BOLD in independent and homosexual-themed cinema. I'd argue this movie is not ""gay"" it is a love story. The nuance is layered, and articulate - and for the educated (or those seeking deeper understanding of classics). That said, it relates directly on a very human level. It is the best character study of a teen-aged male I've seen to date. This film pushes aside all the tired, cliché ""McGay"" films that have littered the landscape for far too long. It is also groundbreaking in finally pushing back against the current culture of leftist PC one-size-fits-all nonsense. The characters aren't role models, or carrying flags on their backs (Thankfully) they're human beings. What?? A film about people being people and not ""saving the world"" or ""fighting"" some ridiculous political battle?? Again, thank you.(Spoiler - you've been warned). My only quibble structurally is the filmmaker needed another edit, and seemed at times to get in his own way. 10 minutes at least could have been spared.We don't learn who Oliver 'is' enough. The story line that he was lying in wait for Elio to 'come around' doesn't necessarily add up in the narrative as presented. The stop-off for a glass of water - just to make the point that Right WIng fascism is alive ad well (image of Il Duce/Mussolini) doesn't really do anything - especially when they arrive 2 minutes later at a fresh Spring. I also found some of the repetitive biking scenes monotonous - we get it - you got a great location and you're serving us so much beauty - however too much sugar can make your stomach hurt. The end scene with the father will play well with the common audience I believe, but it seems a bit long & forced. HOWEVER, none of this negates the 10-star brilliance of the film, and its definitive place in a new canon.I just hope the PC keyboard warriors don't ruin it and make other innovators shy away. It's time to keep pushing that envelope. Well done! (The understatement of the century)."
48,Call Me by Your Name,4,12 January 2018,"Utterly boring, with the exception of Chalamet's excellent performance","This is what happens when (at least my personal) expectations are set too high. Reading many from the other reviews I even wonder whether we all watched the same film. I strongly feel that the stars are mainly given due to the ""delicacy"" of the subject (which, however, is not even really addressed in the movie), or its being non-main stream.I was eager to watch a film, in which James Ivory was involved, since the name is sort of a guarantee. Unfortunately it was quite disappointing. I do not know Ivory's personal involvement in the subject of coming out (neither do I consider it relevant), but compared to Maurice, this one has no real reason to exist whatsoever. The storyline is easily told within half a line: Oliver comes as an assistant to spend some time with the family of an art professor, the son of which, Elio, falls for him. And that's it. Besides the super long aimlessly hanging around there is nothing really happening to justify the film. No internal struggle due to homosexuality, due to age difference, due to Oliver getting engaged, due to Oliver being the assistant to Elio's father. None. Just some half naked bodies hanging around and a series of Elio's tries to approach a much older guy, who is simply indifferent (I do not know whether because the script wanted it or simply bad acting). Oliver kisses the much younger Elio in one moment, rejects him the next without any obvious or implied explanation, only to show him his bruises in his abdomen a few seconds later. The father tries very hard to look like Robin Williams, but fails miserably at tacitly communicating any inner feelings to the audience (provided he is supposed to) like Williams would. He ends up being a father who is absent with the exception, when he consoles his son in the most understanding way thinkable. There is also a mother whose presence is not even noticed, and a girlfriend (Elio's) who is equally understanding and magnanimous, so that no one actually brings any real significance to the plot. Boring as hell, it offers nothing but superb landscapes (thanks to the Italian province, but then again there are much better documentaries for this).IMHO any film must present some action, be it real hero-like action, inner emotional/social development action (which can be twice as captivating, as we are so much used to from other films of Ivory's), or personality analysis/discovery. This one doesn't.Notwithstanding the overall mediocrity, I must certainly praise Chalamet's performance, who excels as a teenager battling with boiling emotions, and surely saves the day, although his last scene should be cut in half. I give the film four stars, three exclusively for Chalamet, and one for Italy.I suggest you watch the film only if you like mediterranean landscapes and in order to appreciate a young actor's talent."
49,Call Me by Your Name,9,7 November 2017,A Moving And Poetic Drama,"Not to single out this particular premise, but films revolving around gay couples have been terrific over the last decade or so. There was a spark when 2005's Brokeback Mountain was released, which eventually brought us to foreign films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour being nominated for a Golden Globe or Moonlight winning best picture at the Oscars. Call Me by Your Name is the latest film to probably receive many nominations in the coming months, and believe me, the praise is not false. Being a fan of 2015's A Bigger Splash, I was looking forward to Luca Guadagnino's follow-up feature film, and I believe this to be an improvement in the best ways. Exploring the hardships of life and what it means to just kick back and relax every now and then, Call Me by Your Name is a film that's been sticking with me since my viewing of it. While it admittedly won't be able to draw in everyone to the theatres, here is why I believe this to be a fantastic, award-worthy picture.Written by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, Call Me by Your Name follows a family that lets Oliver, an older graduate student, live in their home for the summer. While this is a common thing, what's not too common is that Elio, their son, will eventually grow romantic feelings toward this man, convincing him to become his lover for the summer. From the age gap between them and having to hide it from the family, their situation isn't an easy one, nor will it be for some audience members, but it really is a wonderful story. This is easily a story that could've stirred up controversy if it hadn't been done with taste, and because of how it was made, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This was made entirely possible by the incredibly devoted performances by Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer.Hammer has had his ups and downs through the years, appearing in Oscar-winning films as well as some of the worst films of the year, so his performance here was the most shocking to me. Yes, he's been talent in nearly everything he's been in, but he really gave his all in this performance and I honestly don't think he'll ever be better than he was in Call Me by Your Name. On the other hand, young Chalamet has a very bright future ahead of him. Being a relatively new actor, his chemistry with Hammer was impeccably astounding. Their relationship took a while to grow on me, but once it completely won me over, I found myself wondering if there was anything to really complain about.If I had to complain about anything, it would be in its extreme pressure to try your patience. There are very long sequences of silence, making you relax and take in either a romantic moment or the scenery around them, which I also found poetic at the same time, so I actually have trouble coming up with issues, but I have to admit that I did find the movie slow at times. Yes, it's meant to be slow, which is why that complaint isn't exactly valid, but I just have to be honest.In the end, this is a truly remarkable piece of dramatic filmmaking and there are some very memorable scenes that keep replaying themselves in my head. One scene in particular that involves Elio and his father Mr. Perlman (played magnificently by Michael Stuhlbarg) toward the end had me in tears. From the brilliantly written screenplay, to the poetic cinematography, to the terrifically calm direction, Call Me by Your Name isn't a movie that I would send the average moviegoer out to see, but if you're a hardcore film fan, I think you'll end up loving this movie."
50,Call Me by Your Name,10,27 October 2017,Happiness,"The opening phrase ""somewhere in the north of Italy"" is a prologue to the fascinating story of fairy-tale happiness, which is the meeting of a highly educated intellectual and a young creative personality, separated at the age of a couple of decades, and then suddenly converging, revealing a commonality of mutual feelings.The fantastic nature of the story is that they find each other and nobody hinders them. Their lyrical romance does not harm anyone, despite the fact that there is always an extra in love, who will, alas, not be at work. But this love has neither an enemy nor contradictions - that happy event, when everything is perfectly understood, accepted, forgiven and supported.Born in the beginning, the feeling of happiness, not leaving for a single moment, accompanies every moment of this picture, filled with capacious frames from intimate short and voluminous, spatial general plans expressing the thrill and deep breath of lovers, who, as the father of young Elio, very very fortunate.How lucky and all of us with the discovery of a rare gift of Timothy Shalame, who has the ability to control himself and manage his emotions, becoming a completely different person, while leaving the slightest reason to doubt the change of face, which determines the credibility of the whole story, consisting of tender appeals and responses, verbally and tactfully exchanged the main characters of this picture, happy with each meeting alone.Italian Luca Guadagnino represents a radiant light and breathing passion, not devoid of sadness and humor, a sparkling ribbon of happiness, as sincere as the characters of this story, doomed to the inevitable parting, the consequences of which enrich with new paints the psychological portraits of parents, son and his lover , and Shalame performs a creative feat, hanging on the credits in a tremendous pause, which will never be forgotten."
51,Call Me by Your Name,1,31 December 2017,"Lewd, disgraceful trash!","This movie was made strictly for the furtherance of Hollywood (non) values. Starting with glorification of pedophilia, adding another down-your-throat gay theme, and bombarding the audience with graphic and gratuitous sex scenes, this movie further exposes the degeneracy made apparent by Harvey Weinstein and the rest of those bums, AND OF ALL THOSE WHO KNEW AND PROTECTED THEM! The real shame is that the critics are still too afraid to tell it like it is! Whatever happened to imagination, to subtlety, to art? Whether it's sex between two men or two women or a man and a woman, is the audience considered too stupid to know what's going on without the aid of all those graphic scenes? The net effect is that I am now less sympathetic to the gay agenda, less likely to go to the movies, and I will never attend another movie based upon the reviews of the biased and cowed critics."
52,Call Me by Your Name,1,7 January 2018,A Celebration of All that is Wrong with Hollywood,"After reading some of the recent reviews and getting the screener for SAG considerations I was looking forward to watching this ""Cinematic Classic"". Now, after having watched it, I honestly say, I couldn't fast forward through this ""Classic"" fast enough.Sure, it contained some beautiful scenery but that was the only thing I found compelling at all and the only reason it gets 1 star from me. Regardless of how well the book was adapted, the ""celebration"" of youthful romance and finding who a person really is totally lost when you understand what takes place on the screen is a celebration of condoned pedophilia and statutory rape. Sex with a minor is ILLEGAL, immoral and if approved by parents is most sickening. It was overtly paying homage to a culture in the Entertainment industry that is, as I write this, being decimated by scandal after scandal of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Even cinematically it was poorly executed. There were multiple continuity errors, dialogue that was hard to hear, subtitles that were difficult to read due to the color of the background and jumpy editing. Please save your time and watch something else."
53,Call Me by Your Name,9,31 October 2017,A Beautiful Life Lesson,"The old-fashioned love story may appear to be lost in antiquity, but that's only because so many movies and TV series have attempted to rehash it over and over again without anything new and profound to say. What makes Call Me By Your Name an exception is its perspective of a passionate love affair that may externally be labelled as taboo, but is actually an opportunity for a young person to express their emotions explicitly and without shame. This movie captures an important life lesson about respecting time, before it disappears. This human construct imprisons a lot of people in a stupor of routine and depression, because they keep looking back and trying to relive past memories. Whilst remembering is important, and brings out the nostalgia in all of us, this movie tells us to continue living beyond that. The general story of the movie is simple. Not many words are spoken, but the actions speak louder, and what unfolds is a complex relationship between a 17 year-old boy and an American visitor with whom he becomes infatuated. This is a gradual process, but Luca Guadagnino makes it so subtle that it can be a matter of looking for the signs. There's a lot of references to the possessions of people, the bikes, the books, the shirts and the necklaces. Symbolism plays a key part in how we see Elio's sexual development. As his parents appreciate, he is new to the world of intimacy, but his naivety also brings forth a chance for him to learn about his feelings. That is one of the key themes to take from the film - his seesaw journey through the definition of his sexuality is a common factor in most people's lives, but this film addresses that as something natural and something normal.My favourite scene is towards the end, after Elio has been struggling to deal with his lover's absence by suffering in silence. His father consoles him, knowing full well what his time with Oliver has meant. The fact that his father accepts Elio's relationship and feelings to begin with is a great moment, giving Elio the freedom he needs to ask for his father's support. Secondly, it's his father's words that mean the most in the movie; about making the most of these short, yet ecstatic escapades before the chances wither and fade away. Finally, I'd like to commend rising star Timothee Chalamet for his unprecedented and tender performance of Elio. Throughout, you are captured by his innocent nature, and empathise with his internal struggle. The final shot of Elio relentlessly giving in to his emotions is guaranteed to move you at the end of cinema, so much so that you will be struggling to hold in your own tears as you exit the theatre. Needless to say, 2017 has been triumphant in its host of emotional movies, what with Dunkirk, The Circle and Wind River, but Call Me By Your Name stands above them all, with its simple, yet honest, interpretation of love and the emotional consequences that inevitably follow."
54,Call Me by Your Name,1,4 January 2018,Another Gay Agenda Movie this time in a different settling,Fuck you Hollywood force feeding this homosexual garbage every fucking year! What happen to good old fashion love stories between a man and a woman?!?! That's why all the kids today think they are gay! Because you are forcing this bullshit down our throats!
55,Call Me by Your Name,,25 December 2017,awful,"I've never seen a worse movie. Boring, slow, bad caracters, bad acting, i supose it is for adolescent in crises??! Unwatchable!"
56,Call Me by Your Name,8,22 December 2017,Beautiful,"Although Armie Hammer may have given one of his career-best performance, that dwarfs in front of Timothee Chalamet's incredible performance. One of the best things about this film has to be that even being a coming of age story it never assumes a life-changing experience turns you into an all wise human who becomes ready for any kind of challenge ahead. Also, no one is antagonized here either. In spite of all of this, the amount of praise this got was not justified for me."
57,Call Me by Your Name,1,8 January 2018,Worse than Moonlight..,"In Northern Italy in 1983, seventeen year-old Elio begins a relationship with visiting Oliver, his father's research assistant, with whom he bonds over his emerging sexuality, their Jewish heritage, and the beguiling Italian landscape. With a force agenda on it's sleeves Call Me by Your Name is a boring, bland and long film about 2 gay people that fall in love and one of them is a teen and the other is a grown man and if that's called art or a great film? I don't know how a bad one looks like. The movie was awful both in terms or plot wise and character and acting wise. (0/10)"
58,Call Me by Your Name,2,21 December 2017,All Dressed Up,Beautiful music in the background and bicycles rides through the Italian countryside cannot turn a movie about a pedophile seducing a kid half his age into a romantic flick. It's disgusting. This isn't about a boy working through his sexual identity in any kind of age-appropriate manner. It's about an adult pedophile exploiting a boy's vulnerability. You can't have this kind of imbalance in age and experience and try to make it normal. It's not. It's criminal.
59,Call Me by Your Name,8,3 January 2018,one of the favorites at oscar 2018.,"Call Me by Your Name directed by Luca Guadagnino is nominated by many one of the great favorites in the Oscar of 2018, is a very good movie, and really deserves the bets, is a sensitive film, beautiful and with great performances, with a good story Armie Hammer does the best acting in the career, he is very well, but it is not a performance to win Oscar in my opinion, but if he wins, it will not be unfair, but I think that this year we had better performances in the category of best supporting actor, and Timothée Chalamet is even better, does a great performance, his character is full of doubts, and makes really difficult decisions in the film, the film is beautiful and with moments well calm with a beautiful photograph and color palette, the movie has some problems, there are characters that do not add anything, and I found that the relationship of the characters was a bit rushed, I think it was worth the film to have had about 20 mi Call me by Your Name is a sensitive, beautiful film with great moments and great performances. Note 8.7"
60,Call Me by Your Name,10,16 January 2018,Absolute Masterpiece,"If this is even close to how good the book was, I envy the people who have read it. I just finished watching it and I will be buying it shortly for download because I can't wait for bookstores to open. Who cares that the main characters were gay! The love story was so pure, so sublime, so ethereal it felt like a lazy summer afternoon. The pace was so masterful that at the end of the movie I felt like I didn't want to wake up from a great dream. I liked how the movie is romantic, beautiful, insightful, has the best ""I love you"" I have heard in years (""Elio... Oliver..."") and one of the best monologues I've been lucky enough to watch in film and at the same time it's not a fairy tale, it's life with ups and downs, happiness and sadness."
61,Call Me by Your Name,10,15 January 2018,CMBYN,A masterpiece. Work of a genius. Giant cast. Classic.
62,Call Me by Your Name,,15 January 2018,Tedious,"We've seen this story before in different situations and with different characters. But some of those other stories added some humor and moved the story along a bit quicker. This is way too long, and drags in some scenes.As a gay man I can tell you I was touched by some of it but I'm quite sure not everyone is going to enjoy this. It's actually a bit of a downer.It's sad that people, gay people especially, have had to shut off their feelings in the past or in some areas of the world. When you think of how powerful those feelings of love are it's painful to watch this.But do you really want to see that in a film? I don't."
63,Call Me by Your Name,5,15 January 2018,I have mixed feelings,"Call me by your name wasn't as enjoyable as I hoped. The cinematography was interesting and kept me entertained. The colours and the aesthetic were very pleasing and uplifting. The sets were absolutely enchanting. The characters were kind of boring, and didn't really have any specific traits that I could tell you about. There was lots of unnecessary scenes which dragged on and made me uninterested. 
The relationship between Elio and Oliver, while heartwarming, the age gap set me a little on edge, especially because Elio is only 17. 
Overall this movie was alright, I can't compare it to the book because I haven't read it. It was visually appealing but the story was kind of uninteresting and drawn out."
64,Call Me by Your Name,10,14 January 2018,Beautifully heartbreaking,"When you know there's a very close end to the story, will you even start the story? I will. Elio will. Oliver will. Because the love and beauty is always worth it. If I watch this movie 2 years ago, I wouldn't fully understand the pain of loving someone but having to leave it as an eternal memory. In the end when Elio was sitting by the fire, eyes filled with tears, with seconds of smile and then pain, he was going through the whole summer again. And throughout his whole life, he will go through the summer again and again for countless times. It's so heartbreaking when Oliver said ""I'm like you, I remember everything."" But love is all we do. 'To feel nothing so as not to feel anything, what a shame!' Let the beautiful boy remain in the beautiful summer. Let that cute smile remain in that pretty place."
65,Call Me by Your Name,,13 January 2018,Best Coming of Age Story in The History of Motion Picture!,"I won't give spoilers, but I will say that Elio and Oliver's relationship very closely resembles the first same sex experience I had as a boy. The plot line is solid, the actors really become their characters - and while not sexual, the close frienship has followed them into real life. If you haven't seen it, I highly encourage you to watch the trailer and go see it."
66,Call Me by Your Name,9,13 January 2018,"The utmost form of love, and the pain that allows us to grow","Call me by your name takes place in Rome one summer when a 17 year old adolescent played by Timothée Chalamet is transfigured by a bond with a college-grad played by Armie Hammer in a somewhat forbidden but beautiful relationship. Call me by your name is about the tenderness of first love, the depth and long lasting marks that love leaves you with and the utmost form of desire and ownership to be one with another. This was a brilliant film that takes its time to slowly burn through the summer in Rome but to harshly cut to the departure and ending, as out of nowhere as the beginning. A transcending dream like state as viewers follow Elio through his summer. Indeed, As an audience you often don't appreciate as much until it is gone towards the very end. This film captures that state and creates an euphoric and erotic journey about identity and love. Call me by your name was wonderfully embodied and captured by the two leads, Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet. First of all, Armie Hammer portrays his character of Oliver to a level of brilliance and perfection, smoothly and mesmerizingly slipping from the firm, boisterous character in public to the tender, thoughtful character in his privacy. Whereas Timothée Chalamet perfectly blends shy and defenceless with a sense of taking charge and trying to seem more 'grown up' or more 'mature'. Both of these performances were definitely what makes the film such a great watch, adhering to the cinematic trope of 'show don't tell' as a matter of fact, the acting work was transpired ever so brilliantly with the simple dilation of the eye and slightly awkward movements. Call me by your name at its core is about conflict and confusion, specifically those in one's tender age of adolescent. The lack of identity is a great theme that call me by your name wonderfully discusses. This can be seen through out by the deliberate contrast made in the artistic choices, from larger symbolic contrasts like Elio's logic sensibility in contrast to the irrational, sensual and illogical love and relationship that he forms with Oliver; and the seemingly logical, wise and systematic parents of Elio to the relationship of the leads. Down to details such as the pattern of Elio's shirt, with faces representing the many identities, and therefore lack f identity in the character.But, also at the center of this film is the love between Elio and Oliver most symbolically represented by the title of the film: Call my by your name, an action referred to in several points of the movie. A quote seemingly the utter opposite of self identification is the core of the film, the idea of which the largest extent of love is the complete segregation from 'I' and the transition to 'us' an almost ironically tragic idea to present to Elio considering his own lack of identity.In fact, as the film does illustrate to the very end this sense of confusion and pain and tragedy that befalls him is in fact the utmost importance in his journey to maturity. An overall message so wonderfully delivered directly through Michael Stuhlbarg riveting monologue in the final act of the film. He says: ""We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything - what a waste!"" A chilling and riveting message to the audience, of the value in hurt and the importance of pain. So, call me by your name can certainly be considered a sad, tragic, heartbreaking film. But in fact, the message that comes through is that the pain is what allows us to grow."
67,Call Me by Your Name,6,12 January 2018,The insidious Sony MegaCorporation reimagines . . .,". . . JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH with a totally sinister spin in its latest Trojan Horse sneak attack upon America, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME. Said to be the favorite 2017 flick of THE USUAL SUSPECTS star, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME plays like a two-hour promo for the once-outlawed Man-Boy Love Association. Set during the onset of the AIDS Crisis in the mid-1980s, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME features a set of so-called parents who bring a swinging stranger dude into their household to seduce their sickly young son with cigarettes, booze, and sex. Dad tells sonny boy ""Elio"" that he himself ""never had what you two had"" (which he just as easily might have said to his child had they been a victim of Geoffrey Dahmer's or John Wayne Gacy's reindeer games). Among the treats Elio's dad regrets missing out upon is sex with plants, as when Elio rapes a defenseless peach between 1:36:57 and 1:37:31. CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is one of the strongest proofs yet that Sony is the official propaganda arm of what passes for the government of Japan, a failed nation still Hell-bent upon wreaking havoc upon America in revenge for us triumphing over them during the atrocious World War Two parade of horrors they set in motion during the 1900s. Hopefully Leader Trump will nuke them again once and for all, before Sony's filthy film perversions cut the U.S. fertility rate to zero."
68,Call Me by Your Name,7,22 September 2017,Two tough and demanding roles for Armie and a newcomer Timothée,"Timothée, btw, starred in three films I saw this year at 2017 Tiff.He is in demand and taking on difficult roles is the way to get larger ones.It has an interesting premise, I imagine that all of the rave reviews about this film are in regards to its homosexual content, which quite frankly doesn't really excite me, that being said, certain elements were particularly well done.Specifically the acceptance of this by the characters parents in the story.Particularly noteworthy are the words of fatherly advice given to Timothée's character at the end of the film.While pushing towards universal acceptance the director did include some content that could 'gross people out' it also had some problems with pace.This is based on a novel written by Andre Aciman and the words I mentioned before come directly from his book and looks at Americans from a European point of view.Thanks to the leads and filmmakers who came to the Q&As."
69,Call Me by Your Name,10,2 November 2017,Saw this in Sofia at a festival and it was a packed house!,"'Call Me By Your Name', a film about first love and heartbreak. The cinema where it was showing was packed for a festival that this was a part of. This film is tipped for the Oscars and I can well see why. It is a mature film set in 1983 in Italy and perfectly captures a boy's first love and heartbreak in losing that love. It does it without mushy sentimentality, just truth. The final scene were the credits role and the camera concentrates on the boy's face for 6 minutes as you see the heartbreak set into his features will surely go down as one of the great cinematic moments ever captured on film. In many ways this film is challenging, in that it portrays a love affair between an older man (mid to late 20s) and a teenage boy of 17. But the emotion expressed in such an honest way could apply to anyone gay or straight and audiences are flocking to see it. Both of their lives are messy and it's not straight forward, the older man is quite unlikable and arrogant and it's only as their affair starts that you see the real person blossom. The boy has his first sexual encounter with a girl from his town. But the empathy of his father and acceptance of his son's great love, a love that the father says he never had nor never will, pushes this film beyond mere stereotypes and cliché. The final sequence will leave you emotional, if you have ever had your heart broken at a young age you will see the truth in the boy's face and be grateful that the boy takes his father's message of 'feel the pain, don't bury it, treasure it'. If it wins an Oscar it is well deserved."
70,Call Me by Your Name,,24 December 2017,A boring and overlong erotic film,"""Call me by your name"" should the most overrated and undeserved movie in the year 2017. It is so boring that you just keep wondering when it could end. Besides, there are plenty of sex scenes which essentially make the film an erotic one."
71,Call Me by Your Name,7,20 September 2017,Beautiful story about gay love under the Italian sun,"This movie has gotten very good reviews, and I was excited when I saw it during a film festival in Oslo, even opening film. The story takes place in Italy in 1983. A wealthy Italian family receives an American male researcher who will live with them for 6 weeks. The meeting between him and the family's teenage son is the foundation of the story in this film. The film depicts the tension between the two, which eventually evolve into a close friendship. A friendship that evolves into a sexual relationship. The film is beautifully portrayed. The two men unfold in a beautiful landscape. But film is slow and briefly depicts how the contact between the two evolves. In my opinion, the film could be have shorter, and would have benefited on that. It's a too slow and somewhat tedious. The film's content is also not very new, but it's beautifully filmed. It also reflects on a theme that shows that we are not going back so many years back before gay relationships were taboo and that such love had to be hidden. In addition, this is also about an adult man initiating a relationship with a teenage boy. There is solid craftsmanship in both filming, acting and role- playing. But the direction could have been tighter, in my opinion, and the film is too long. But I still enjoyed seeing it."
72,Call Me by Your Name,9,19 December 2017,A new gay classic,"""Call Me By Your Name"" is a marvelous meditation on first true love on a gay theme. The director, Luca Guadagnino, has created a film that simply refuses to force anything upon the viewer. The film is a masterful study of direction as observation-of letting things be as they are. Timotheé Chalamet is a joy to behold on screen as a coming of age youth in the throws of self-identification and self-legitimization. His late-pubescent struggles with societal constraints and self-inflicted moral dilemmas permeate his nascent feelings for a mid-20s scholar who has come to assist his father at the family's Northern Italy summer retreat. It is an Oscar worthy performance-at once charming, evocative and tender. Armie Hammer's brusque and intelligent performance as the American scholar is also noteworthy. HIs scenes take us by ambush. As hawt as he is to look at, one can't help but be reminded of a rhinoceros charging out of underbrush when his character enters a room. And just like that, a rare new experience unfolds for these tentative lovers who find themselves in an era (the 80s) of overall non-acceptance. One gets the feeling, too, that this experience as it develops will never again be repeated. Interestingly, the AIDS epidemic does not touch this film. In my opinion, a wise decision by the director who transports us to a place of transcendent beauty, as first love ought to be. Love here is remote, fragile, un-worldly, and yet all-knowing, brave, undeniable. It is difficult to create a film so clear and direct in its depiction of life's ambiguities. I didn't want the film to end. A pleasure through and through."
73,Call Me by Your Name,,24 November 2017,One of the most perfect movies I've seen since The Shawshank Redemption,"Brilliant. There are no other words to describe it. Just brilliant. The way the film expresses Elio's emerging sexuality is just so beautiful. The film perfectly captures what it's like. What I loved most about this film is how much I could relate to it. Just a beautiful, heartfelt, masterpiece."
74,Call Me by Your Name,8,14 November 2017,Haunting,"Timothée Chalamet sets the bar very high. He is entirely natural, you never feel he's acting, yet he communicates every skipped heartbeat of his character's love. Armie Hammer, meanwhile, impresses in a completely different way as Oliver, an American arrived in Italy to work as an academic assistant for six weeks . Initially presenting himself as an old head on young shoulders, Mr Hammer seems to shed years as the story progresses, his spirit freed by his encounter with Chalamet's Elio.The first hour of this remarkable film winds up the sexual tension to an almost unendurable pitch, as misunderstandings give rise to missed opportunities and missteps. The course of true love never did run smooth....The film is not without flaws. Only an actor as good as Michael Stuhlbarg, as Elio's father (who is Oliver's employer) could convert a self-conscious, set-piece speech into the moving, compassionate declaration that we get. And although on occasion Luca Guadagnino's direction borders on genius -- including the astonishing final scene -- it occasionally resorts to unsubtle symbolism that would turn into something comic if it weren't for the commitment of the actors. All that aside, I find many images, lines of dialogue, and Mr Chalamet's incredible intensity, haunting me. I expect this will continue for quite a while yet."
75,Call Me by Your Name,1,30 August 2017,A crap soulless movie for pedophills,"This crap movie does not have a soul in the first place. Its a dumb celluloid piece! There is no sensible story or acting but welded celluloid pieces about some disoriented people wandering not knowing who lead their own lives. There are worst scenes such as Elio's intimate scene with a peach - so disgusting, yuck! What does the movie director expect us to do with that miserable scene?? PC gone mad if you criticized this cacophony. Total waste of time and money!"
76,Call Me by Your Name,4,31 August 2017,An escapist fantasy,"Of course all gay men have been there. You spend your summer holiday on your father's estate, meets gorgeous young man, fall in love... Call Me By Your Name is a well executed movie which is actually nothing more than an escapist gay fantasy. Long before gay-themed movies and books became mainstream, stories like this one were abundant in LGBT periodicals. Of course this story (like practically any other story) has already been told. The very first example which comes to my mind is Brokeback Mountain. The recently released BBC produced mini-series Man In An Orange Shirt is also worth mentioning. Elio is handsome and young, his father is rich and owns a luxurious villa in Europe. When spending his summer holidays on his father's estate Elio meets Oliver who is also handsome and young and just happens to be gay. The guys spend a lot of time together, swimming, bicycling and visiting neighboring cities. Eventually they have sex. But wait! The story is set in the early 1980-s. So, they can not be together. And their lives take them in different directions. The end. I have no idea if gay man who will watch this movie (and they definitely will watch it because Armie Hammer playing Oliver is very hot even from my straight point of view) will be able to relate to these characters and their story. After all as I said it is a well executed escapist gay themed fantasy. Watchable but not memorable."
77,Call Me by Your Name,9,27 November 2017,"Spellbinding, transporting, beautiful","Guadagnino's sensual trilogy comes to a climax with this incredible adaptation of Andre Aciman's novel of the same name. The cinematography, performances, settings, and music (Sufjan Stevens you angel) coalesce into one of the greatest films of the decade. The layers of romance are deftly explored, and Michael Stuhlbarg's monologue will leave you speechless."
78,Call Me by Your Name,1,8 January 2018,Totally Overrated!,"I had great expectation when I purchased to book. Couldn't finish it. So boring and too much monologue that didn't reveal any of the depth of the character. No drama at all. The whole book is dull and boring. 
Then I was hoping the movie would have more drama and be more interesting. Yes, indeed. But not by much. For one thing, I found the two characters flat and not engaging at all. I didn't get it why they would connect. They didn't even show lust in their eyes, despite their serious ACTing of lust. 
Well, I attribute half of the dullness to the book/story (there is not much to develop for the movie) and half of the dullness to the director/acting. 
And it is rated 8.4/10, while Brokeback Mountain is 7.7/10. Go figure. Something is seriously wrong here. A lot of robot reviewers here on IMDB maybe? Or something is seriously wrong with this world."
79,Call Me by Your Name,8,1 January 2018,"'Call Me by Your Name' is an airy, meditative look at a summer of sexual discovery.","'Call Me by Your Name' is an airy, meditative look at a summer of sexual discovery. Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet--who was recently introduced to audiences in 'Ladybird' and is destined for an even bigger spotlight--bask in the Northern Italian countryside, soaking in each other's company as the camera drifts like a zephyr through the idyllic scenery.The acting and cinematography particularly stand out, so much so that one must pity those (or themselves) who have to trudge back to their cars through crusty snow and single digit temperatures after watching these two lovebirds lounging in the sun for an entire summer.Given the subject matter and release date, I suspect that various film executives hoped this film would replicate last year's success of 'Moonlight'--which, let's not forget, won the Oscar for Best Picture--yet 'Call Me by Your Name' is simply far less compelling. And while it served as a pleasant respite from the harsh winter, it felt more like a June release both in feel and overall impact."
80,Call Me by Your Name,10,1 January 2018,Actors and their Faces,"I want to describe how perfect this film is. From its story (a perfect adaptation) to its cinematography, to its soundtrack, to its beautiful setting. You can practically breathe and feel the warm summer Italian breeze, but I don't think i'm qualified to do soBut to anyone who wants to see this film. You have to look at the actors' faces especially Timothee's and Armie's. Observe how they look, and the movements in their faces and how they can display so much different unique emotions in such a small amount of time. You can practically see joy and melancholy and frustration personified in their facesI've read the book and its like their thoughts can be seen by looking at their faces, it's crazy. I've rewatched this film like 10 times already, and it reminds me perfectly on how I fell in love. This is certainly the greatest film i've seen in 2017, and one of the greatest i've seen in my whole life"
81,Call Me by Your Name,8,1 January 2018,Good chemistry and great acting.,"After falling in love with the novel, I was looking forward to the movie. The fact that it was getting great reviews made me hopeful that it was going to retain the soul of Elio and Oliver's love story. And it did. However, it's not because it's a good movie. It's because of its stars, Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet. Theirs was a casting decision made in heaven.
The movie is alright. You can't go wrong setting your story in northern Italy, the art direction is gorgeous, the rest of the cast is very good, and the soundtrack is spectacular. I wasn't very impressed by the direction and the script fell short in building Elio and Oliver's relationship. There were a few inconsistencies in the editing that threw me off, and the fly on Elio's shirt when he is breaking down in front of the fire, ruined the final scene for me.
The film itself doesn't give us enough elements to believe Elio and Oliver have fallen in love. Based only in the director and writer's work, it's just a summer fling, kind of intense, but in the same way Sandy and Danny had a thing in Grease. 
Enter Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet. It is their interpretation what makes this movie one of the most beautiful and honest romantic film of this decade. Every word, every breath, every move, every glance, every heart palpitation take us through the journey of what it is to fall in love and be broken hearted when it all ends. I wish the movie had expanded more on their trip to Bergamo (Rome in the novel.) In the three days away, Elio gets a glance of what his life could be with Oliver as his partner."
82,Call Me by Your Name,8,30 December 2017,A touching story,"I once saw the film's trailer on Youtube. Since then, I really expected to watch the full movie. Honestly speaking, it is out of my expectation because the storyline is both touching and sensible. That is not to say, the actors' performace are perfect.The film has many good point on its plus side. It contains many emotional conflicts when Elio, the main guy, begins recongising his love to Oliver, her father's student. The most fanstatic thing is the analysing Elio's emotion.It is so sensitive and the young actor successfully performed it. I would vote him a star and a star for Oliver too.I love the film for it is performed in sensitive scenes, beautiful and tranquil lanscape. Another is the script is abstract and thought-provoking. the camera angle at the Palvie( or sth) circular war monument when two guys talk is good at digging into a analysing character's feelings. Finally, the Elio eyes are tearful, which makes me remember the film well after it ends.I would recommend this for those who have sensitive souls and those who have an open-minded view."
83,Call Me by Your Name,,25 December 2017,All the respect for Chalamet,"This film is a brilliant exploration of the sadness surrounding the discovery of one's first love to someone of the same sex. The story's pace and the timing of any important revelations is perfect, the sensitive and effortless direction captures the beauty of Italian landscape and the mood and spirit of the '80s. A lot have changed still then regarding the treatment of LGBTQ issues, but given the location of the film is in Italy, I'm guessing the male machismmo is still very much pervasive there at this day and age. It almost feels like were watching a contest going on between Elio, Oliver or Mr. Perlman, Elio's father, as to who is the most miserable.Chalemet gave a very heart-breaking performance for a straight guy as a teenager trying to discover his sexuality with his father's research assistant in his mid-20s. Too effective and credible a performance that I believe he should not gain a reputation for brilliance entirely just because of this film. It's an acting talent that should not be wasted, more doors should open up for the audience to show off his acting chops.With Hammer, he exudes the melancholic aura that he desperately tries mask. Whatever it is that looms at the back of his head, it is best for the viewer to figure this on their own make theoir own opinion. It is this ambiguity that makes his performance an interesting one to watch as the story unfold.Mr. Stuhlbarg, on the other hand, is just an important character in the film and just as pivotal as the two male lovers because as the title suggest, he could have said that line himself to Elio or Oliver.. 
My rating: A-minus"
84,Call Me by Your Name,8,28 October 2017,it's a good story,"I watched this movie tonight. It may difficult to say it is a totally good movie, but the director really tells us a good story...in a right way. The director changed the end of the story, although they are still separated. But I really like this new ending, at least Eliot still has his father and the family. I feel empty after the movie. Fortunately, it is not for my ex-boyfriend anymore. I feel extremely bad for Eliot and myself who have passed that heartbreaking path by himself. In Chinese, we called 'You Qing Ren Zhong Cheng Juan Shu', which means wish all well, jack shall have Jill.Best wishes, to all of us!!"
85,Call Me by Your Name,9,30 November 2017,"Forbidden love, heartbreak and strong family values filled this terrific film","Relative unknown Director Luca Guadagnino (""A Bigger Splash"" 2015) has hit the movie jackpot with this at times painstakingly slow moving storyline that ultimately proves a backdrop for forbidden love, heartbreak and strong family values. While Awards talk is high across the board for actors Armie Hammer (""The Social Network"") and Timothy Chalamet (""Lady Bird"") - especially his final scene in the film, the breakout performance (in my book) here is Michael Stuhlbarg (TV's ""Fargo"") who embodies the soul of a thoughtful and honest father, and who delivers one of this years best end of film monologues - kudos to writer James Ivory for these final words of self revelation and wisdom. Also standing out in this film is French actress Esther Garrel (""17 Girls""), who graciously walks the line of the young women on the outside. As beautiful as the film develops into, the heart of film really doesn't get started until the proverbial fruit is pulled from the tree. Yes, cinematography (Sayombhu Mukdeeprom) sets the carefree warm summer Italian villa mood, and Ivory's story about this educationally astute family is appealing, but I wanted more of everything at a faster pace. Not to be missed here is the films score, written by Giorgio Moroder and Keith Forsey, featuring amazing songs by Sufjan Stevens. There is a lot of great emotion within this terrific film, especially towards the end, so stick with it."
86,Call Me by Your Name,8,4 November 2017,Call Me by Your Name: A Special 'Friendship' Blossoms.,"Homosexual, coming of age, erotic drama. A film about sexual awakening and sexual discovery.Set in Italy, in the summer of 1983. The father figure is a history professor who always takes an annual summer-time intern.The son, Elio, played by Tim Chalamet is the 17 year old son, who spends his days playing classical music and reading. The intern, Oliver, played by Armie Hammer is the charming 20 something, intellectual intern who lives with the family to help with the professor's research.Elio and Oliver have truly great chemistry and slowly grow closer, frustration turns into infatuation which turns into love. Elio and Oliver have several very emotional, romantic scenes until Oliver inevitably returns home and emotions boil over. Look out for the very best scene in the film towards the end where the father discussed the prior few week's emotional events with Elio during an extended dialogue scene (a master-class in parenting). If Moonlight can win the 'Best Picture' Oscar then this film has more reasons to do the same! A 'Best Actor' Oscar for Armie also looks possible.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
87,Call Me by Your Name,10,18 December 2017,A flat-out masterpiece.,"This film tells you by compelling you to experience Elio's world, embodied so beautifully by Timothee Chalamet and under Luca Guadagnino's careful direction, which lends this masterpiece its timeless quality. This film sneaks up on you, as you feel that you are walking with Elio in his journey of self-discovery and are implicated in every juncture in his path. Let this film-- this experience-- engulf you and activate all of your senses. It will, and when it does, don't resist it. Like Elio, I went through a cinematic journey that left me feeling never quite the same. A must-see."
88,Call Me by Your Name,7,11 December 2017,A Strong Film About Love & Being Who You Are!,"'Call Me by Your Name' is a film about LOVE. Its also a film about being who you are. And Writer James Ivory & Director Luca Guadagnino bring us a tale on young romance & living life, with honesty & the emotional impact akin to a sledgehammer. And Timothée Chalamet is the find of the year.'Call Me by Your Name' Synopsis: In Northern Italy in 1983, seventeen year-old Elio (Timothée Chalamet), begins a relationship with visiting Oliver (Armie Hammer) , his father's research assistant, with whom he bonds over his emerging sexuality, their Jewish heritage, and the beguiling Italian landscape.We've seen love-stories before on Gay people, but not all leave the impact like 'Call Me by Your Name' does. This is an honest love-story about a boy and a man, who can't help but fall in love with each other, despite never coming to the world of their sexuality. And the way Director Luca Guadagnino has shot its leading lovers, is something to watch. There is genuine heartache in its characters & also undeniable love. This is a love-story, that's sad but also heartfelt at times. James Ivory's Screenplay is expertly written, offering a story on love & longing, without ever indulging into melodrama. Luca Guadagnino's Direction is simplistic, but extremely effective. Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's Cinematography captures the passion of its leading lovers, with gusto. Walter Fasano's Editing is mostly crisp. Art & Costume Design merit a special mention. Sufjan Stevens's Score is superb.Performance-Wise: Timothée Chalamet is truly the find of the year. The youngster delivers a searingly beautiful performance of a young man who comes to realize his sexuality to a much older man. Chalamet brings nuance & innocence to the part & stands out from start to finish. He's truly one actor who deserves strong Oscar buzz for his excellent work here. Armie Hammer also does his best work here. He and Chalamet share a infectious on- screen chemistry, that appears real & affecting. The Wonderful Michael Stuhlbarg is masterful as Chalamet's dad, who understands his son beyond his silences. Watch him in the penultimate moments & you'll know his caliber as a performer. Amira Casar as Chalamet's mom, also is lovely. Esther Garrel as Chalamet's girl, with whom he experiences sexual episodes, is fantastic.On the whole, 'Call Me by Your Name' leaves a strong impression. Make time for it."
89,Call Me by Your Name,10,10 December 2017,"Perfect, sensual, simmering summer romance.","'Call Me by Your Name' is directed by Luca Guadagnino and written by James Ivory based on a novel of the same name by Andre Aciman. It is the story of a sophisticated and cultured seventeen year old named Elio (Timothee Chalamet) whom over the course of a gorgeous northern Italian summer experiences first love, romance and what it feels like to truly find oneself. He is on vacation with his parents at their beautiful 17th century villa spending his time writing and playing music and flirting with his girlfriend. His father Mr. Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) is an archaeologist who specializes in Greco-Roman culture and his mother Annella (Amira Casar) is a translator. Every summer Mr. Perlman hires an assistant to help him with his work and this particular summer he brings in and American college graduate student Oliver (Armie Hammer) which completely throws off Elio's easy going behavior. Elio is immediately taken aback by the new arrival. Oliver is a tall, handsome, smart and good-natured young man and Elio's admiration for him begins as soon as they are introduced by Mr. Perlman. He spends as time with him as possible, wherever Oliver goes he goes and he attempts to court with unbeknownst to Oliver until he a certain scene when he subtly reveals his intentions. Eventaully they bond over such things as their friendship, their shared Jewish heritage and of course their summer romance. Subtle is actually one of the many words that describe this film very appropriately. Things are often said without words but simply through the performances of the amazing cast. Particularly Chalamet and Hammer who both give career best performances. Stuhlbarg as also shines in a few standout scenes especially towards the end of the movie.One of the things I like the most about this film is how the writer and director treats a gay romance. There have been countless movies about the victimization of gays and struggles they face which are also important when done correctly. However it is remarkably refreshing to watch a gay romance depicted just like any other. Elio is not persecuted in this movie for his sexuality, which is technically bi-sexual as he does have girlfriend at some points in the movie but nevertheless, he simply learns to deal with his emotions and how to express himself in an honest way. Another major strong achievement of 'Call Me by Your Name' is its ability to create a sense of mood thanks in large part to the cinematography, musical soundtrack and on- location production design. It enjoys a number of original songs which are very much complimentary to the themes present in the movie. They are topped off by 'Mystery of Love' by Sufjan Stevens. The movie moves along with a wonderful simmering pace, not too fast, not too sluggish. Thanks to this you legitimately feel like you are spending a whole summer with these characters and are just a fly on the wall observing their experiences. I honestly do not think that there is a single flaw with this movie and if there is I couldn't find it. It is immaculate from the first scene to the last. 'Call Me by Your Name' might not be the best movie of the year but it may just be the most perfect. It is a knockout and deserves every bit of praise and recognition it gets this awards season. I couldn't recommend it enough."
90,Call Me by Your Name,9,2 December 2017,"Summer love discovered, explored and never forgotten","I am usually quick to start focusing on the next film as soon as I've finished one, but here is a rare exception that I prefer to let linger on for a while even at the risk of my memory of it becoming unremarkable. That's because it's one of the most subtly affecting and beautiful love stories that I've seen in years. A low-key pace and a sumptuous musical score build the film to a conclusion that is truly flawless.The story is of a young American graduate student who stays with a professor in his country house in Italy in the summer of 1983 and slowly develops an intimate relationship with the professor's precocious 17-year-old son. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer are both brilliant in this film as the two who find companionship in an unexpected place, and Michael Stuhlbarg is wonderful as the professor. The young man and the teenage boy do not interact much at first, mostly because the young man appears detached and unresponsive. But I would be loath to reveal too much after that. Let's just say it's a film that one should absorb slowly and let its quiet power take hold. It's a film that truly captures some wonderful truths about the human condition, about the emotional toll of relationships and about how much one's secrets shape one's dynamic with others.In terms of cinematography, there is much of the Italian countryside to marvel at. It makes that country seem like one of the most blissful and sublime places in the world to visit. History buffs and linguists will find some welcome material in the professor's dialogues with his graduate student to enjoy. As quiet and austere as the film may be at times, it contains a deeper passion that gradually gets tapped into and colors the mindset despite the taboo nature of the material. Never long or protracted, it will keep you guessing until the end and just leave a haunting feeling after it's over. Gladly recommended to anyone in search of true cinema."

Meaningless conversations, complete lack of logic and overall in general ABSOLUTE BOREDOM, that may be the worst screenplay ever written. CAMERA WORK: Focusing the camera on completely unnecessary things like closing the fridge or TAKING A PISS? I MEAN???????? You know what i don't even have the energy to describe how disgusted and shocked i am so imma stop right here GOODBYE"
92,Call Me by Your Name,9,30 December 2017,almost perfect,"Actually, I regret to read the book before watching this. I can't stopping compare it to the book involuntary. When I watching this film, I thought it's newness and agreeable sometimes, but it could disillusion me sometimes. I'm totally a fan of the book, and I think it's perfect and rated it full score. The scene that most surprised me is their flirting by playing piano. I don't really know classic music, so I can't imagine that scene when I read it. And another scene I loved is the final scene: Elio stared at the fire and wept. And I also love the scene that Elio expressed his love to Oliver. Anyway, Timothée has really good acting skill, and I truly wish he can win the Oscar. I think the directing is pretty good, but what dissatisfied me is the screenplay. Actually, my favorite scene is gone, the scene that Elio gave Oliver a book as a gift. For you in silence. But I really enjoyed the soundtrack, although it didn't be nominated for the Golden Globe."
93,Call Me by Your Name,9,29 December 2017,Stunning,"It is a very well directed film. The movie is just so real, Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer have an unequaled chemistry. They build a relationship in a wonderful way, and I think it's also due to the script... It's amazing! They do not rush to present you the beautiful connection between Elio and Oliver, there's definitely a very interesting development. The Italy of 1980 certainly gives a romantic atmosphere to the movie. There are certain things that I didn't like, the cinematography for example. I feel it is very simple, it could have been better. But in general I think it's an amazing coming-of-age film."
94,Call Me by Your Name,10,28 December 2017,"A quiet, yet soulful and sensual summer ...","Film Review: ""Call Me By Your Name"" is possibly the name of the best film of 2017. I will likely remember this movie more than any other film I saw this year. Set in the summer of 1983 in a countryside villa in Italy, filmmaker James Ivory (""Maurice;"" ""A Room with a View;"" ""The Remains of the Day;"" ""Howard's End"") penned a screenplay, adapted from Andre Acimen's novel, that is truly breathtaking. Intermixing American English, French and Italian, Mr. Ivory carefully crafts a human story.The main characters are Elio, played by Timothee Chalamet (""Interstellar;"" ""Lady Bird""), and Oliver, portrayed by Armie Hammer (""The Social Network;"" ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."") Elio's father is an eminent professor of archaeology who brings in Oliver, a doctoral student, for the summer to work on his thesis. Bathed in golden sunlight and the ravishing Italian countryside, Elio slowly develops feelings for Oliver.Director Luca Guadagnino (""I am Love;"" ""Bertolucci on Bertolucci"") triumphs. With only one read through with the actors and shooting most of the film in sequence, Mr. Guadagnino achieves an honesty that is rare on film. Never forced and full of doubt, insecurity, hormones, and missed opportunities, everything about Elio's first love feels like what I remember when I fell in love for the first time. It's a heady experience to be transported back to what it felt like to be in love at 17 or 18 or to remember what it felt like to have a romance that begins in the long afternoons of June and ends when the sun begins to set too early in August. Mr. Chalamet's performance is without a doubt one of the best of the year. He navigates a quiet, yet soulful and sensual summer with disarming ease. He leads the screen with a confidence equal to Armie Archer's bold American bravado. The gentle, yet fiercely emotional, relationship revealed over the course of the movie is stunning.I must also note that this is one of those films that makes you feel like you've been on vacation. The cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom and attention to detail construct a vivid experience. The charming cobblestone streets, beautiful rocky trails through pine-filled forests, leading to lazy rivers and watering holes are experiential. This film is pretty perfect. ""Call Me By Your Name"" is a film where you meet real characters and visit a very distinct place in a very specific year. Winner of the American Film Institute's Best Films of 2017, nominated for 3 Golden Globes, including Best Picture - Drama, and nominated for 6 Independent Spirit Awards. I understand that at the New York Film Festival ""Call Me By Your Name"" received the longest standing ovation in the festival's history. I hope the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences likes this film as much as I did, because it deserves an Oscar Best Picture nomination."
95,Call Me by Your Name,9,25 December 2017,A summer of youth,"This movie reminded me firstly of my summers spent in France at my grandparents house. The lazy summers of childhood and sun. It reminded me secondly of the summers spent in Italy during my teenage years, the warm nights where the sweat clings to your skin, spending most of your days in swimwear. This movie was nostalgic for me, I closed my eyes and I could feel the summer. The splendid camera work heightens the feel of the movie, it brings you in and doesn't let you go. The love story between Elio and Oliver was full of sensuality and emotion, like a beautiful piece of piano music or the first bite of a delicious peach. Hammer and Chalamet portray a astonishing relationship that is interwined with growing up, sexuality and the finallity of summer."
96,Call Me by Your Name,9,11 January 2018,Immersive,"Call Me by Your Name stars Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg and Amira Casar, and is directed by Luca Guadagnino, who brought us 2015's A Bigger Splash, which is in many ways a bit uneven in terms of tone and pacing, but certainly not inadequate. He also directed I Am Love, which I haven't seen, but hear great things.
Set in 1983, it tells the story of 17-year-old Italian-American-intellectual Elio, (Chalamet), whose family regularly visits their 17th century villa during the summer in Northern Italy for his father's (Stuhlbarg) archaeological research, involving the salvation of ancient sculpturing. Along comes mid- twenty-year-old grad student Oliver (Hammer), who comes to spend the summer to assist with Elio's father's research. Though Elio at first slightly despises Oliver's ""over-confidence"", the two grow closer and closer, and Elio's cultured, sophisticated, yet naive and hormonal nature coupled with Oliver's higher maturity and life experience creates some of the most emotionally charged and truly charming chemistry that I have seen on film in a long time.
I think what makes Call Me by Your Name so special is that it's one of the most immersive movies ever put to cinema. Watching it feels authentically like you're on a holiday in the summer of Northern Italy in a way that trashier American romance films in which the central characters travel abroad on holidays cannot capture. 
This is a movie that isn't afraid to just meander and lull about, and just generally chillax. It doesn't concern itself so much on plot, but more on atmosphere, environment and performance. By golly, it would be fundamentally unfair for both Timethee Chalamet and Armie Hammer to not both win best lead actor simultaneously for this one film, but alas, also impossible. I would also be surprised if Stuhlbarg doesn't get a nom here for supporting. But the lack of traditional storytelling beats, such as conflicts and turning points etc etc only work in the film's favour to further emphasise the sense of environment and love and passion, and the sense of it feeling so very much like real life, which unlike a screenplay, isn't all structured accordingly and specifically. Real life is messy and spontaneous and instinctive, just like this movie.
The immense level of confidence brought to the screen by Guadagnino in collaboration with his actors make this one of the most beautiful films of the year, maybe even of all time. This is also quite a long film, and in many ways it feels long and meandering, also a bit like real life, which is not a bad thing at all, and it works for what the film is going for.
This will draw a lot of comparison's with 2016's Moonlight, mainly due to it being an auteur piece of awards-caliber filmmaking that happens to be about being gay. However, I will say I think Moonlight has the slight edge, possibly due to it having distinct conflict within, but also because I found it connected with me on a slightly deeper more personal and relatable level, despite me being a straight dude. Other teensy flaws are that even though the movie feels wonderfully real, there is some dialogue which isn't as realistic as the film in which it's contained, where it doesn't quite feel like how people talk in real life, which is the complete opposite case with Moonlight.
But Call Me by Your Name is an absolute master work, there's still several 2017 Oscar contenders I'm yet to see, but right now it stands as my favourite film of the year, it's a film that you need to just sit back, relax, get comfortable and just go with it, become involved with it, let it literally wash over you, take it in, and it will hit anyone and everyone who's ever been through, or happens to be going through either hormonal stages or finding first love. On many occasions throughout, some quite early on, I was having to fight breaking down into fits of sobbing and heaving, and when the power of cinema can do that on a genuine level, it's two thumbs up and no less than a 9.5/10"
97,Call Me by Your Name,9,10 January 2018,"Elio, Elio. Elio, Oliver, Oliver, Oliver...","While I was watching ""Call Me By Your Name,"" I was reminded a few times of the sentiment between Beah Richards and Spencer Tracy in the speech about not being able to remember what it's like to love someone, the way her son loves his daughter, in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."" Nothing seems forced in this film. It's love with all of that goes with it. The obsession, the crazy joy, the hurt, the first kiss, the last kiss, the sweet touch of a hand on a shoulder, the other people who intrude, or give respite, and all else that goes with it. Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet are the key as to why this film is able to reach its beautiful, emotional, highs and lows. Both are so natural, it almost seems like the viewer is a voyeur, watching their relationship evolve from irritation to irresistible . Some scenes say a great deal without any dialog, like Oliver standing across the room listening Elio playing the piano."
98,Call Me by Your Name,10,10 January 2018,A MASTERPIECE,"I went in with high hopes for this film, and it surpassed every expectation.It is a visually stunning film, there's simply no other way to describe it. From the colours, to the music, to the costumes, to the locations, to the shots. But most of all the story and the performances. If you've read the book, you already know how beautiful and heartwarming/heartbreaking this story is. A story about how two young men fall in love with each other during the summer. The actors cast as Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer) do an absolute fantastic job. Their performances are as natural and pure as they come.This film is a must watch. It's full of love, heartache, culture, music, love, love and love. Full of gorgeous shots, incredible scenes and lessons to learn. It'll be referenced and quoted to for many, many years to come.It's simply a masterpiece."
99,Call Me by Your Name,10,26 December 2017,"A film that is fully rounded, conceived and executed.","Call Me by Your Name is a brilliant and as complete of a film that i have scene in a long time. It is fully rounded, conceived and executed. Screenplay, directing, cinematography, music, and of course the acting by an ensemble cast that is all hands on deck, with Timothée Chalamet & Armie Hammer leading the way. I came to this film through the book first (audiobook; read by Armie Hammer). Books of course are a different media than film, so knowing this you understand it's not going to be an apple to apple comparison. The adaptation to film however was beautiful done and satisfying. At its core this movie is about first love, and how as a young adult experiencing this un-explainable emotion to which you have no past experience or tools to manage. Is heartbreakingly captured by everyone involved in this film.Timothée Chalamet is truly amazing in this film. I won't go into specific scenes. In general however, he so deftly conveys the anguish, confusion, helplessness, happiness, and connection his character Elio is having for another person. Elio is so overwhelmed by his love, and how to express it, that placing his face into the chest of Oliver is at times the best he can do. It's so real and heartbreaking. I know more about Armie Hammer and his body of work. Oliver is a great role for him and he takes it on, makes Oliver his own and provides the lift and backdrop that Timothée Chalamet (Elio) needed. I'm excited to see more from Armie with this role as a spring board. I enjoy his work. Again, I think Call Me by Your Name at its core is a film about first love; orientation is irrelevant. For me the pace of the film is exactly what it needed to be. It takes it time...just like first love does."
100,Call Me by Your Name,9,25 December 2017,A Raw Depiction of Romance,"This gorgeous film will cut anyone who sees it to the core. It was carefully crafted with the softest of brushstrokes from director Luca Guadagnino. The striking visuals and setting are seamlessly presented to the audience and go hand in hand with the love story we are witnessing. The story, and the way it plays out, is hauntingly effective. This feat is achieved with such an intimate, soft tone that feels painfully real. The production takes a step back and allows the story and the characters to just be, and the end result is overwhelmingly moving. The performances by everyone, but of course by the two leads, are entirely credible with their naturalistic delivery of dialogue and internal emotional resonance. This movie is beautiful in the most natural way, depicting a bittersweet romance in a manner rarely seen in film today. It is pure beauty and will go down among the most effective and memorable romances in film history."
101,Call Me by Your Name,9,22 December 2017,Stunning....,"Wow guys, what a movie!!! Acting, scenario, directing. Masterwork really, masterwork. The story is way more than just 'another' gay movie, its about adventure, experience, friendship and off course love. Emotion bound between Elio and Oliver is epic, that bound touch heart off everyone who whatching movie!
As i said, not just gay movie, this is story about to bisexual gays. But with this great scenario and directing, what ever sexual orientation is in story, it would be still be great!
LOVED IT!"
102,Call Me by Your Name,3,1 January 2018,"""Intelligent""","Some types of people are saying: ""Oh my god, the Kingsman is such a boring movie"", than they watching this, and they say it's ""Brilliant"". Some people say:"" This is an Intelligent movie"" because they switching language between: English, France, Italy, German etc. It's so much boring. I watched one hour from this film, and after 58 minutes. I put my arms up on the air and screamed: ""Mi a F#sz???"" which is totally not a compliment. If you want to watch good or 'cute' romance film, go watch ""The Big Sick"", not because I'm homofobic (I'm not homofobic), because it's a good movie, with good characthers, and good(and real) story."
103,Call Me by Your Name,10,18 December 2017,An unforgettable summer romance and a sense of belonging,"Rarely movies succeed in creating such a sensual and at the same time realistic sense of place and make us feel like we are living with the characters and experiencing emotions and desires with them... Beautifully shot and acted, well paced and incredibly warm - a must see. This is why I go to the movies."
104,Call Me by Your Name,8,10 January 2018,"Well made, but extremely slow-paced.","'CALL ME BY YOUR NAME': Four Stars (Out of Five)A coming-of-age romantic drama from director Luca Guadagnino (who also helmed 2009's 'I AM LOVE' and 2015's 'A BIGGER SPLASH'). It's about a 17-year-old living in Italy, who begins a romantic relationship with his father's American assistant. It's based on the 2007 novel (of the same name) by Andre Aciman, and it was scripted by James Ivory. The film stars Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar and Esther Garrel. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards (including Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Actor-Drama, and Best Supporting Actor). I found it to be well made, but extremely slow-paced. Elio (Chalamet) is a 17-year-old Jewish American boy, who lives in Italy with his parents (Stuhlbarg and Casar). During the summer of 1983, his father, an archaeology professor, invites a Jewish American graduate student, named Oliver (Hammer), to come stay with the family in order to help with paperwork. Elio initially doesn't like the presence of Oliver, but he slowly becomes attracted to him. A romantic relationship between the two soon develops. 
 
I've enjoyed Guadagnino's other films, especially 'I AM LOVE', but this one I had a hard time sitting through. I appreciate that it's a coming-of-age gay love story, I think Hollywood needs more of those, but it's just so slow-paced in my opinion, and long. The acting is all good in it though, the cinematography is beautiful, and the climax is involving. It's definitely not a bad film by any measure, but you have to have a lot of patience to sit through it (I did at least)."
105,Call Me by Your Name,10,10 January 2018,A unique film,"My English is not strong enough to describe this film. I put it simple, this is what i call the real art, when the plot transcend the screen and comes to life. I love every scene, dialogue and performance of this movie. Extraordinary actors, beautiful soundtrack, gorgeous scenery, life-changing story, and brilliantly filmed."
106,Call Me by Your Name,10,9 January 2018,Worth Flying 785.6 Miles For...,"This review is merely a thank you note for Timothée Chalamet for blessing us with a breathtaking performance. Dearest Timothée,I don't know how I could ever recover from the experience of witnessing your impeccable portrayal of Elio. Timothée you are something else; your every gaze, pout, smirk, step, and tear translate literally every single narrative Andre Aciman wrote for Elio (this is coming from someone who's read the book twice!). And for that I am forever grateful, indebted even, for your stirring something in me, for the gut-wrenching end credits, and for making me lying in bed at 2.30 am wide awake contemplating life and romanticizing pain. Later!
KiaraPs. I did fly 785.6 miles just to see the film. So yeah..."
107,Call Me by Your Name,10,9 January 2018,Wow...Speechless at beautiful this movie was,"Like Elio in the end, I just sat there in stunned silence at the end of the movie.Timothée Chalamet made this movie in his portrayal of the young Elio smitten by Hammer's character Oliver. Timothée Chalamet at his age is already an accomplished acotr. I hope he continues to play roles such as Elio and take us to another place with his depth of character shown so matter of fact by Timothée Chalamet. This young man was brilliant in the role of Elio, brilliant.So true for the times in 1983. It was a beautiful story, very European in that things are not blowing up in the first 5 minutes to capture your attention. I may as well shut up and say to anyone that loves an even pace, believable emtions having to remain hidden for the times but revealed at the end...then you will love this movie as I did."
108,Call Me by Your Name,8,8 January 2018,The World Is Still Not Ready For This But See It Anyway,"A great film with strong acting, directing, writing. Everything a movie needs to be great. One of the better LGBTQ-themed movies I've seen that can easily become more mainstream and less arthouse if more people were a little more open-minded.Other reviewers here are using strong words like ""Masterpiece"" ""Classic"" and ""Moving"". I'd certainly agree with all of them, but this movie isn't for everybody. Film lovers will adore it, others should pass."
109,Call Me by Your Name,6,8 January 2018,Pederasty Glorified,"Allow me to start with a quote from Wikipedia: ""Pederasty in ancient Greece was a socially acknowledged erotic relationship between an adult male (the erastes) and a younger male (the eromenos) usually in his teens. The influence of pederasty on Greek culture was so pervasive that it has been called ""the principal cultural model for free relationships between citizens.""In the film the erastes is an accomplished American scholar (""I am almost a doctor"") while the eromenos is a bright and ultra-cultured 17-year old boy. The social acknowledgement mentioned above comes in the form of a father/son frank conversation at the very end of the film, in which the father of the teenager praises and gives his blessing to the relationship just consummated by his son. In a tedious monologue of platitudes you are given to ""understand"" the entire message of the film. And just in case you were not quite clear, the father is an archaeologist/professor of ancient art, who digs up a Greek statue from the waters of a lake and at one point remarks that those ancient sculptures were so ""curvy and beautiful"", as if ""designed to entice you"". So...if you go for that sort of enticement, or if you are about 14 years of age and wondering what to make of certain troubling urges you will find the film revealing. I, for one, found it to be overlong, boring and irrelevant: the action takes place in the plush summer villa of a family who among themselves converse in Italian, French and English, and for entertainment read German poetry or listen to their son play the piano....just the typical home of an average film-goer, then. I see that the film has somehow garnered a number of award nominations, but other than the quite convincing acting of the two male leads I would struggle to agree."
110,Call Me by Your Name,,7 January 2018,A beautiful film,"This film tells the story of a 17 year old man in a small town in Italy, who is the son of an archeologist. One day, an American research assistant arrives to assist with research, and the young man's life is not the same again.It is refreshing to see that a coming of age film that is not overly dramatic. In this film, all characters appear very real, and they connect with each other and with the viewers. I like the fact that the story is delivered in a understated, or even muted manner. The pacing is slow, which gives time for feelings to develop and sink in with the viewers. The final scene is just super effective, it makes me hold my breath to listen intently on what the father has to say. The message is not just applicable to the characters in the film, but to every human being on Earth. It is a profound message about the heart and the body. This film is such a beauty."
111,Call Me by Your Name,8,7 January 2018,Most definitely worth seeing,"This was a very sweet film. Timothée Chalamet was nothing short of amazing. His performance alone--against the backdrop of rural Italy--would make this worth seeing. I guess it's open to intepretation what the movie is about. Seems to me that Elio is gay but doesn't know it, and Oliver is gay and can't accept it--or at least he can't when he's at home. So the two come together at an opportune time for a brief period and end up with broken hearts when they have to part.As a gay man, I find the criticism of the ""gay sex"" aspect amusing as this was about as mild as can be. Seriously, a gay guy having his first gay experience with a closeted gay guy finally able to taste the forbidden fruit should result in far more explosive sex. Another subtle thing that I didn't see mentioned anywhere. It was clear that this was a European film and not an American one. All the Europeans spoke like 50 languages and spent their time listening to, writing, or transposing music, or reciting poetry, or engaging in other cerebral activities. I get it: Americans are loud, unsophisiticated monoglots lol. I don't necessarily disagree, but the point was made, however subtly.I'm not one to cry at movies but the last few minutes put me to the test for sure. Again, this actor is amazing.Very good film, highly recommended. I look forward to seeing Timothée Chalamet in other movies."
112,Call Me by Your Name,8,6 January 2018,"Emotionally and Cinematically Beautiful, Yet Heartbreaking",Http://nickkaminskysblogspot.blogspot.com/2018/01/review-call-me-by-your-name.html
113,Call Me by Your Name,10,6 January 2018,A Piece of Art,"This film was the most wonderful piece of art I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It was perfection.The emotion is so raw and tangible, it is as if you could reach through the screen and grab it. I was entirely captivated for the whole film and I have never felt so connected to a film in such a natural and real way that doesn't feel manufactured. The cast, director, writers... everyone who took part in this film did a phenomenal job. Emotions and raw love and sensuality and sexual tension are so strong and powerful and conveyed in such a playful, humorous, delicate way that it took my breath away.There is nothing I can say about this film other than the fact that everyone should watch this. Absolutely everyone. You will never see anything like this again."
114,Call Me by Your Name,8,31 December 2017,A Daring Love Story,"It would be easy to dismiss how daring ""Call Me by Your Name"" actually is, yes even in 2017 when gay relationships are more accepted than they probably ever have been. There are still plenty of people in the world who would not give a film about the budding sexual and emotional relationship of two young men a chance. This film has some serious balls for treating the subject so delicately and yet so erotically.Make that two sets of balls, one owned by Timothee Chalamet and the other by Armie Hammer, who play the lovers. Chalamet gives one of the most understated but impressive performances of the year as the younger of the two who is experiencing an infatuation comprised of equal parts love and lust for what we suspect is the first time. Hammer is the object of his obsession, a studly, bronzed student who is staying in Italy for the summer and working for Chalamet's professor father (Michael Stuhlbarg). The film is languid and sun drenched, creating visually what a summer spent lounging in the Italian countryside must feel like. Both of the principal actors have a great deal of screen time, but the film easily belongs to Chalamet, who in the course of one summer experiences more reciprocal love and inevitable heartbreak than many people experience over the course of their entire lives. The best scene in the film comes late into its running time, and it's comprised of a soliloquy delivered by Stuhlbarg in which he attempts to help his son deal with the pain he is feeling over an ended romance and also hints that romantic relationships between men, even men who identify as primarily straight, are possibly more common than anyone realizes, or would be if men felt that they were allowed to have them. It's one of the best scenes I saw in a movie this year.Grade: A"
115,Call Me by Your Name,4,4 January 2018,A Disappointing Slog,"I was so disappointed, I had hopes that this critically acclaimed film would actually be good. I was hoping for another Brokeback Mountain, instead I sat through I film so dull it felt like it was six hours long. I don't know how old Oliver was supposed to be, every indication seemed to be that he was in his late 20s judging by his apparent education and physical appearance. That just makes him pretty much a sexual predator preying on a confused, naive seventeen year old boy. That is not the basis of a great love story. If the story was about a heterosexual relationship and Elio was a girl, then Oliver would come across as a predator and people might notice that nothing actually happens in the entire film.There was no conflict at any point in the film, Brokeback Mountain or Moonlight had the societal pressures against their relationships weighing on them, feeding into their confusion and struggle. That is not present here, no one has any problem with homosexuality, and while there is certainly nothing wrong with that, storytelling thrives on conflict, and that was certainly missing. It was essentially a summer love rom-com without any comedy. There was no reason to care about the characters, as someone who is not homosexual, there was no way for me to connect to any of the characters, because they really weren't given any other traits. This led to me really not caring what happened to any of them in their pampered carefree lives.The entire film is building towards a speech at the end that was well done and served as the culmination of the entire film. Then, at a perfect moment to roll credits and leave on a high note, it then proceeds for 5 more minutes to no effect besides destroying any lasting impact of the speech."
116,Call Me by Your Name,,3 January 2018,"stylish, sensual","Call Me by Your Name directed by Luca Guadagnino is a beautiful movie based on instant admiration, attraction and body worship. Timothee Chalamet as teenager Elio is awesome. Elio lives with his mom Annella and dad Mr Perlman( Michael Stuhlbarg: The Shape of water, Arrival..) in Northern Italy . Oliver (Arnie Hammer :The social network), an American student ,stays with the family for 6 weeks to study under tutelage of professor Perlman. Elio is drawn instantly towards Oliver's good looks and American ways of relating to others. Passion is beautifully captured between two humans. When it is time for Oliver to leave, Elio is filled with gloominess. Elio learns about life and life's opportunities from his dad. Oscar nomination for style and Oscar worthy acting by Timothee Chalamet. In some ways, the movie had some similarities to movies Beginners with Christopher Plummer and Breathe in with Felicity Jones. What makes Call me by your Name special is the quiet understanding of the situation by Elio's mom who sees the need for Elio and Oliver to spend some alone time. enjoyed the beautiful locations and Stylish Direction of sensual scenes. superb title. Oscar worthy."
117,Call Me by Your Name,8,3 January 2018,Powerfully Poignant Romance,"Have you ever seen a movie that you liked but then once you see the ending you really really liked the movie? Well, that was Call Me By Your Name for me. What is undoubtedly a good movie for 115 minutes, becomes a great one after the full 132 minutes. Luca Guadagnino directs this film in such a calming but yet provocative manner. When the film needs to heat up, it does, and when it needs to slow down and provide a more methodical and thoughtful approach to romance, it most certainly does that as well.I guess with every big film there's always a section of the audience that comes out with serious backlash to some sort of aspect to the story. With Call Me By Your Name, it was that the romance between a 24-year old male (Oliver, played by Armie Hammer) and a 17-year old male (Ellio, played by Timothee Chalamet) is unethical and highly controversial. While I can't speak for how that particular group of people felt watching the film, I can tell you that I never once felt like this was a relationship that wasn't consensual. In fact, it's not even so much that it was definitely portrayed as consensual by the two males (and the parents of the younger male for that matter), but it's that the film never makes an outright statement saying that a relationship with this age gap is ""right"". It's a fictional story with fictional people. No one is telling you this relationship is right or glorifying what is considered to be a forbidden relationship.Personally, I took it more as a young male figuring out love for the first time and the person who helps him discover that love is an older (albeit only 7 years) male with more experience. I won't tell anyone who feels differently that they are wrong, that's simply the way I saw the story play out. And if I'm being honest, I thought the relationship between Ellio and Oliver was beautifully told and portrayed. Chalamet is magnetic and relatable (no matter what your sexual preference is) and Hammer nicely balanced the ""hard to get"" and effortlessly desirable part of the romance. I'm a straight man in my mid-20's but I found there to be things very relatable in both of their characters.The film also does a good job of presenting a world that feels foreign but also approachable. Taking place in Italy and in 1983, Call Me By Your Name is great escapist cinema, while also being something timeless in storytelling. Something only few films can capture, a few being Richard Linklater's Before Trilogy, which was clearly an inspiration. My only gripe would probably be the pacing, which is purposefully slower in nature. For me, I just would have liked something that gets to the punch a little quicker. Speaking of ""the punch"", the clear winner of this picture is Michael Stuhlbarg's ending speech about love to Ellio. I never thought a short monologue from one man to another could be so powerfully poignant, but that was this speech.8.6/10"
118,Call Me by Your Name,10,3 January 2018,A rare piece of cinematic perfection,"After seeing dozens of films all year, I was pleasantly surprised by this incredible work of cinema. ""Call Me By Your Name"" is paced well, with dynamic and complementing roles that are simple to understand but complex in their nuances. Every actor delivers an incredible driving performance, shaping a compelling and all too familiar tale of coming of age and romance and heartbreak. The films features great original music by Sufjan Stevens and stunning landscapes of the Italian countryside. It is powerful and driving and simple. A must see."
119,Call Me by Your Name,6,2 January 2018,Solid Film but Far From Great!,"Unsure what I am missing considering the passionate following for the film. CMBYN is a solid romantic drama but far from the masterpiece people want you to believe.Pros:
* Charming performance by the lead Timothee Chamalet. 
* Solid supporting cast. 
* The script is well-intended and honest. Refreshing to have a film like this not succumb to cliché Gay script plotlines. 
* Lush production and cinematography.Cons
* Armie Hammer is wooden, in genuine and miscast as far as I am concerned. He shares uncomfortable chemistry with Chamalet and is by far the weak link to the film.
* Film comes close to the cusp of being too pretentious.
* At times the film is boring and really struggles when nothing happens. Having seen nearly every Gay film out there, this one ranks right in the middle of the heap. Good to see some massive recognition for a film like this, but the hype isn't really deserved. It's a not-bad film but this isn't ""Brokeback Mountain"". There were far better films of it's type over the last couple years."
120,Call Me by Your Name,6,28 December 2017,Brokeback mountain in Northern Italy in 1983,"It's just a solidly acted romance flick with nice settings, good direction and acting. I score it a solid six regardless of the sexuality of the characters, because I find romance movies a bit boring and contrived. Why people seem to give reasonable romance flicks a ten out of ten because of some sexuality bias, I don't get it. I didn't think Moonlight was anything special either.I wish people would stop giving unwarranted praise, just base a movie on its own merits."
121,Call Me by Your Name,8,28 December 2017,Lovely ...,"I enjoyed this very much. The cinematography was excellent. The acting is exceptional and artfully emotional. However, there were a few quibbles that I wished had been addressed a little more clearly. The age gap seemed larger than it actually was given the actor's appearances. I was a little uncomfortable with how ""young"" Elio looked (and sometimes acted) compared to a much more ""mature"" looking Oliver. I was a little concerned about some rather unsettling pedo-vibes that may have unintentionally resulted from this. I think this may have been exacerbated by Elio's obvious infatuation with Oliver and a much less defined attraction on Oliver's part.And I was a little dismayed that the girls in this film were treated and used with such disdained -- basically experiments and/or beards as the two gay characters came to terms with their own sexuality. It impacted how much I liked the main characters -- particularly towards the end of the movie when Oliver had that smug scene on the bus leaving town. I cannot help but feel for all these heartbroken women who get run over by the sad/terrible forces in this movie and who are victims in their own right. All are collateral damage (including Oliver's future wife) and that makes me even more sad for the characters in this movie. I wished that aspect was addressed a little more thoroughly and less flippantly. Still, I loved this movie ... found it incredibly moving, poignantly beautiful and just lovely (despite its flaws). Well done ..."
122,Call Me by Your Name,9,27 December 2017,A breathe of,"To me, this film was pretty much perfection.It's a beautiful film, set in a beautiful rural Italian setting with a stunning cast. I walked out of this film feeling a lot of emotions, both sadness and happiness. Thanks to both the actors and its production, its remains authentic in nature and never goes off into unrealistic tangents. Its production is minimal, allowing for the emotional portrayals of the characters to speak loud and in great depth. Armie and Timothee were both brilliant, so good that you can feel that strong lust between them and the utter anguish when that is taken away. It is really captivating to watch for its lengthy runtime.However my favourite scene was when Elio's father speaks to him on the couch, sharing a poignant lesson he'd learnt from his own life after baring witness to his own son's 'close friendship' with Oliver. This echoes into Elio's phone call to Oliver at the film's conclusion. Theres a real sense of desire and heartache. It speaks in a lot of truths, the great loss of innocence and realisations at the hands of a man with such maturity and brilliant-knowingness, and the strength to lust through restricted circumstances.Beautiful film!"
123,Call Me by Your Name,7,26 December 2017,Awards bait..........probably deserved!,"I am not the target demographic when it comes to this film and others of this ilk, so take that for what its worth. Personally only bothered to watch this film because of the good reviews and the fact that it will probably be mention around awards season.Due to the fact that I'm not the best person when it comes to romantic films, this film sort of didn't work that much however I did find myself enjoying some elements quite a lot that surprised me. Straight of the bat, the directing and acting in the film is top class, even if you hated the film you have to expect that the people in front and behind the camera have done a great job. Having a great setting obviously helps because it would actually take a miracle to make the shots in the film look horrible or disgusting. The Story for the most part just goes straight over my head but again thats because I'm not into this sort of stuff usually, but I think that audiences that like this type of film will really appreciate this film. The character dynamics in the film are interesting from the two main leads to the family as a whole, there is a intriguing laid back atmosphere throughout. This can be a positive and a negative at the same time, this is because the film does drag quite a lot, it could just be me because I'm not that invested in the film that much. Saying that I was surprised with how much comedy there was in the film which actually worked for me!There are some character choices throughout the film that don't make much sense to me but again that just me be. Another that kept me.......i don't know.....erm thinking why.... was the change in languages that would happen throughout the film. One minute its Italian and then the next minute i swear its French, I could be wrong but to me it just made the location almost feel like a fantasy. I expect the fact that on the border of two countries there will probably be a language cross over, but to me I didn't work, if anything it was quite distracting. Either you stick to Italian or French why both??After all of this I'm surprised to say that the directing and the character moments throughout the film for me a really strong and quite good even though I'm having to drag myself through it at times. Give me another 10-12 years until I'm in my mid 30's and then I'll probably appreciate this film more. I still think its good but its not that memorable and I'll probably never watch it again, however I do understand people for loving this film and it deserves the awards mentions it gets. 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10 its good but not really my thing, each to your own!"
124,Call Me by Your Name,7,25 December 2017,Left me emotional but did not live up to the hype,"Following the enormous praise this film has received I went and saw it with high expectations. And I have a lot to say about it.First - and I'll get right to it - it did not live up to expectations. Unfortunately. My main issues are purely from an entertainment perspective; it's not a super slow film, but it's certainly not packed either. It's not a Hollywood drama, and while it shouldn't be and certainly doesn't try to be, it was slow at times. For personal taste, I could have done with a few more eventful scenes.Second, also regarding living up to expectations, I wasn't left feeling as devastated as many reviews had led me to believe I would. Without saying too much about the plot, that's related to my first point.Third, the hype about the acting and chemistry is real. Boy is it real! The two main actors are simply brilliant together. In fact all the actors delivered.And finally - and this is a big one as it's what led me to write this review - I experienced something I have never experienced before. When the credits started rolling, on top of a very long closeup scene of one of the main characters face, the movie theater was silent. DEAD SILENT! No one got up. No one spoke a word. Everyone was emotionally taken. We all stayed until the very end, not because of some overly dramatic event, but because of the pure realness of the entire film. GREAT job!Call Me By Your Name is beautifully shot and has great actors, and make no mistake, that's where the emotions comes from. Not from a dramatic plot. It's very much down to earth. If you go in knowing this, you will simply love this beautiful film. If you don't, yo might be disappointed the way I was."
125,Call Me by Your Name,6,31 December 2017,Unanswered Questions,"A very Aryan-appearing male shows up at this B&B for visiting scholars with a Star of David around his neck. Virtually the first question the Jew asks his host is, Where is the bank? Banking has nothing to do with the central theme of this movie (an attraction between two males, one older, one quite young). Why are the characters Jewish? The only subsequent reference to Jewishness occurs many months later, when we see a menorah (incorrectly rendered) during Hanukkah and someone grabbing a gold-covered chocolate coin. End of Jewish references. None of the reviews I read comment on these occurrences in the movie that I found really quite peculiar, the banking question especially. That said, no one will agree with me, but the director/writer has no concept of ""scene."" Scenes should be mini-stories, mini-dramas, if you will, that cohere and have a punch, but the ones in the movie are mostly pastiches and rarely end in a satisfying manner. The film is pretty, I'll give it that, but I'm astounded that it's gotten overwhelmingly wonderful reviews."
126,Call Me by Your Name,10,23 December 2017,An overwhelming summer love,"I had never written a review before, but after watching this movie i just felt the necessity, so i am sorry for my not so good english. I don´t know where to start, but i should say that is one of the best romantic stories i have ever seen. I don´t know what adjectives should i use to describe this, it is so sensual, erotic and beatiful. The cinematography is gorgeous, with some beatiful landscapes of Italy (and also a lot of culture!). The sondtrack is really great and worth listening more than once, including the Sufjan Steven´s songs. What can i say about the acting? Timothee Chalamet was just perfect as Elio, he is outstanding and is probably getting many awards; i can´t wait to see him in other movies. Armie Hammer as Oliver was great too! They both have excellent chemistry and the dialogues between them are perfect. I haven´t read the book yet but Luca Guadagnino made an excellent job, and i am sure that is greatly adapted. What i liked the most about this film is that it doesn´t bring up the typical homophobia or AIDS plot, is just the romantic story we deserved, and every single minute is worth the watch. It will probably become a classic in the future. I won´t spoil the ending, but i gotta say that is just so overwhelming and heartbreaking at the same time. You definitely have to watch this movie as soon as possible. Oh, by the way, there is a scene involving a peach that you probably heard about before, it is as perfect as you can expect and it could get the entire film the awards it deserves."
127,Call Me by Your Name,9,22 December 2017,"distinguishing, pure and gentle","""Call me be your name"" is a vision of love and truth. Love comes at the first place in the movie. The feeling of desire of the main characters is so pure and gentle which made me pretty satisfied to watch it. It comes naturally, step by step. By exploring the area they live in and spending time for talking about art and life they start getting to know each other. It works like a binder, but they're not sure what every and each of them really wants. There's a time when they did and that's what really matter about their relationship. It had better to be remembered about times the plot takes place - it's 80s and it's a hard period for an unconventional love. The end of the movie is sorrowful and tough for, I think, both of them. Oliver is older and seems to get used to reality of the world he lives in, but he still has a hope. On the other hand, Elio is much younger and inexperienced. He's full of hope as well, but his hope is related with naiveness what turns out exacatly at the end. ""Call me by your name"" is an one of these movies which deeply moved by its form and gentleness. The history of those men urge me to think straight, but also remember who we really are. I couldn't forget about the soundtrack which fits as a glove to the movie. The film director - Luca Guadagnino - has done a great job and so have the actors. Thank you for such a poignant piece of art!"
128,Call Me by Your Name,10,22 December 2017,"Magical, deep and mature","How can a movie be so magical but at the same time so mature and realistic?
This movie HAS to win The Oscar of The Best Picture. Every single idea that I had about it was wrong, I thought it was going to be good, but not that good. Call Me By Your Name is so surprising, you can never tell what is happening next because of its maturity, it is nothing like those romantic comedies that people are used to.
 The actors makes the most amazing job, they have the most beautiful conection I have seen since Before Sunrise.
This is much more than a LGBTQ movie, it is a movie about love, freedom, pride, and the most importante lesson: Feeling what you have to feel, and not just ignore, independently if it is love, hapiness or sadness."
129,Call Me by Your Name,10,22 December 2017,This film epitomizes why film is a type of art,"This film will take the viewer on a journey of self-discovery. While some closed-minded individuals will write the subject matter off because it is a story of first love between two male characters, it is much more than that. This is a story that every human being can identify with, the story of first love and sexual awakening. The film evokes every possible emotion in the viewer and is a complete treat for the senses. While it may be an independent lower-budget (by today's standards), it never falls short in any area. The cinematography is breathtaking, the locations beautiful, and the music perfection. That being said, the acting is of a caliber seldom seen in cinema. Timothee Chalamet is destined to become the next Laurence Olivier. His talent knowns no bounds and one can only surmise the potential ahead for this stunningly beautiful and multi-talented young man. Armie Hammer proves once again, his matinee idol good looks are only surpassed by his ability to own a character. He embodies this character in mind, body, and soul. The chemistry between these two actors is never forced, but completely believable and natural. This film is destined to be a classic as it is absolute perfection. The viewer becomes lost in this world of 1980's Italy and in the pure emotions of these beautifully written, directed, and acted characters. This is the type of film that deserves to win every award at every competition and is one you certainly do not want to miss. I hope the rumors are true and that there will be a sequel as these characters have become so dear to me that I want to know more of their future."
130,Call Me by Your Name,10,22 December 2017,infinitely relatable,"I found myself being strongly reminded of my first love... and my most recent love (for radically different reasons) when watching this exquisite tale of the eternal and universal poetry that this story illuminates.Watch this with an open mind and I hope it melts over your heart like warm honey... seeping into every crack that time might've placed there... until, for even a moment, you feel whole."
131,Call Me by Your Name,10,20 December 2017,One excelent movie in years,"Sensible, inspiring and trully emotional.
I was sceptic at the start - but now i think there is more in this movie than you can see at the first look.
It is not exactly a movie about gay's but about true human values
There is a clue: do not miss the last 10 seconds of the movie !!!!
A must see."
132,Call Me by Your Name,9,19 December 2017,A rare gay classic,"""Call Me By Your Name"" is a marvelous meditation on first true love on a gay theme. The director, Luca Guadagnino, has created a film that simply refuses to force anything upon the viewer. The film is a masterful study of direction as observation-of letting things be as they are. Timotheé Chalamet is a joy to behold on screen as a coming of age youth in the throws of self-identification and self-legitimization. His late-pubescent struggles with societal constraints and self-inflicted moral dilemmas permeate his nascent feelings for a mid-20s scholar who has come to assist his father at the family's Northern Italy summer retreat. It is an Oscar worthy performance-at once charming, evocative and tender. Armie Hammer's brusque and intelligent performance as the American scholar is also noteworthy. HIs scenes take us by ambush. As hawt as he is to look at, one can't help but be reminded of a rhinoceros charging out of underbrush when his character enters a room. A rare new experience unfolds for these tentative lovers who find themselves in an era (the 80s) of overall non-acceptance. One gets the feeling, too, that this experience as it develops will never again be repeated. Interestingly, the AIDS epidemic does not touch this film. In my opinion, a wise decision by the director who transports us to a place of transcendent beauty, as first love ought to be. Love here is remote, fragile, un-worldly, and yet all-knowing, brave, undeniable. It is difficult to create a film so clear and direct in its depiction of life's ambiguities. I didn't want the film to end. A pleasure through and through."
133,Call Me by Your Name,10,28 December 2017,Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.,"This is the movie of the year, the movie of 5 years, the movie of the decade. This movie is the one and only movie I would rate a perfect 10. After reading the book and seeing the movie. I would say it's perfect. The book and movie go perfectly together. You see the movie and you want more, then read the book. You read the book and need more, you must see the movie. It's the perfect emotional ride. Just the right amount of smart humor. It makes your heart race, tears flow and emotions soar. Incredible."
134,Call Me by Your Name,10,28 December 2017,Visual Poetry of the Emotions,"Watching the movie in its entirety from beginning to end (and yes, even till the end credits rolled to black) felt like having an arrow shot right through to your heart and it got yanked out with a sudden force that it hurt so much.And the pain from that bleeding heart was the emotional pain I feel when you lose someone.As melodramatic as it sounds, that's how heartbreaking the movie felt.Yes, we've seen plenty of other love stories been told on films. Let alone one that is of LGBT-themed. But the thing is unlike many other LGBT-themed films that usually independently-made this one got mainstream attention.And I'm glad it did, especially having read the book years ago. So knowing that it's getting a screen adaptation I was naturally ecstatic.And it could very well be the best LGBT film I'd seen so far.As genre-centric as it is, the pair of lovers could simply be interchangeable with hetero couples or anyone with a heart.In essence, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME is a human story that is multi-layered. As for the tempo of the film, no doubt it was a slow burn but the emotional payoff at the end of the movie was worth it. In a sense that, we feel the heartbreak that Elio felt. Not to mention, those scenes served the story in the bigger aspect of the movie.As strange as it sounds, it weirdly felt good to be torn apart emotionally in such a way. Perhaps, as human beings, we yearn for some affection some way or another. And thus, deep in our hearts we can relate to the emotions of the characters whether we choose to be opened or discreetly be quiet about it.And granted that, both Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer (even Michael Stuhlbarg) were playing their respective roles, yet the impacts from the characters they played left a deep impression on myself having seen how they evolved through the film.To quote a reviewer, he described the film as a visual poetry. I couldn't agree with him more. This is one piece of art for the ages."
135,Call Me by Your Name,10,28 December 2017,Be prepared for a film longer than Hollywood kids expect but it is well worth it,"Diane and I saw this gorgeous film in Fremantle this afternoon, and we both thought highly of the movie: I think my highly out vaulted her highly.Be prepared: the film is quite long; the various pieces of the script take time to fall into place meaning that the completed movie is like one of those one thousand piece jigsaw puzzles that seem too complicated at the beginning but are hugely compelling when finished.Please don't get me wrong the film is not an Agatha Christie mystery; however, it does contain many pieces that need to be carefully joined: parents and son, girlfriend and son, lover and another girlfriend. The viewer will quickly fit them together, but they do require patience as the movie will be considered slow-moving by contemporary standards.My recommendation is to make every effort to see this film; however, don't bother if you are homophobic or do not want to see female breasts on the movie screen. Other than those caveats it is a brilliant film."
136,Call Me by Your Name,10,27 December 2017,Superb comimg of age movie,"The story, the adaptation, the Italian location and especially the acting make for a superb, emotion and drama filled movie. The chemistry between the actors is wonderful. It will be one of those movies that I know I will watch many times. Why wasn't my youth like this?"
137,Call Me by Your Name,10,25 December 2017,Best in romance and amazing actors,This movie is pretty sensual and thanks to timothee and armie's chemistry. They have made this movie a gem. My best movie so far. Loved every bit of it. After watching it you can relate any true love story with it.
138,Call Me by Your Name,10,25 December 2017,one of the best films i've seen ever (instantly a top 10),"When I saw this film, not only did I know it was going to go on my favorite films of all time list and my personal top 10 list, but I knew I had to write a review about it, it was just so good, I couldn't just give it a review and move on, I had to write about it, so here's my review. Before I saw this film I had basically seen no promotional material of it except for the interviews and the general consensus of this film being that it was great, but I didn't know much about the actual film or what happens in it, so all of it was a healthy surprise for the most part as obviously you can't avoid promotional material for a film like this successfully for three months without seeing some spoilers here and there. Nevertheless it was still a breathtaking experience I can only heavily recommend you experience for yourself. At first I wasn't sure what to expect from it, I already had incredibly high expectations and thank God I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Not only is the acting absolutely superb in this film, it also depicts such a realistic relationship between two people that you can really get drawn into and feel personally connected to. It's one of those stories that you never want to end, you can constantly sit there and experience the relationship between these two grow and develop, but it eventually comes to an end in the most heart breaking way it could have whilst also making sense and tying up the story in the best way. The most important element of the film and the most obvious positive for me (aside from the acting which already stated was fantastic) was the camera work and the editing which I found did such a huge favor to the way the story progressed and the way I understood the characters and how they were feeling as well as what was trying to be expressed in the scene, it really blew me away all the creative choices that went behind that and how well it all came together which is always something I fear when watching a film as the editing and the camera work can be a film's weakest link in terms of how it's presented as a final product. The only negative that really stood out for me (that really didn't have a great impact on the overall rating of this film) was the pacing which I felt could have been a little bit faster and more concise, but I did really appreciate some of the scenes that Luca decided to leave in to really create the atmosphere that was needed for the film to work in the way it did, it felt like I was really experiencing something real and honest between two people who are just as real. I love the characters in this film, especially Elio and Oliver obviously, and Elio's parents and that's about it, but that's enough because these characters are so interesting to follow that having very little people to care about has actually done a lot of good for the film as a whole, it also gives time to their relationship and time for me to feel for them and truly understand how they feel about each other which is the focal point of the film after all which I felt was executed so wonderfully, never did I doubt the validity of the feelings that were being portrayed in this film or the sincerity of the acting either. I really do feel like this film will be a leading example of how relationships of any orientation should be portrayed and explored, it shouldn't be rushed but should be handled with sensitivity and with absolute care. Sometimes I got mixed up with Marzia and Chiara at times, but apart from that they were good also, not as good as I hoped they would be but they were fine, they didn't ruin the film for me as most roles like this do which was a nice surprise so that's good too. The setting of the film could not have been more impactful, the city that the film was set in was really a key element to how the film felt which of course was the main idea, I also like how vague the location was in the film and didn't really give any hints as to where they were specifically, it felt more fantastical that way, making it more charming in a way and pulling it away from reality. The soundtrack for this film is beyond phenomenal, before and after I watched it I couldn't stop listening to 'Mystery of Love' and 'Visions of Gideon' which were such good songs to put into the film, it really helped build that sensual and emotional feel to it, the music in this film is definitely something that people should praise and acknowledge (thank you sufjan). It is an incredibly devastating film, I wasn't expecting so many tears when I watched it, I knew I was going to get upset but I didn't think it would make me feel that bad, I know this film is going to have a lasting effect on me, like most good films do, and I can't be thankful enough for films like this to be something I can watch and review and experience, we are so lucky to be able to watch films like this in considering the terrible climate mainstream Hollywood is in at the moment and it couldn't have been done in a better way. I also really appreciated how this film handled gay sex and how it didn't exploit it in the way most gay films do, I found it to be a very refreshing take on a story that could have easily been misdirected in the hands of a less talented and intelligent director who knew how this story should be presented. This film blew me away, the end scene was absolutely heartbreaking and I am warning you now, expect to bawl your eyes out if you are a sucker for stories like this (like me). The cinematography is excellent, the casting director for this film (Stella Savino if you didn't know) deserves an award of her own and all the praise in the world. The way it makes you feel so many emotions is incredibly impressive and I can only wonder how difficult it was to create such a fantastic film like this, it's masterful filmmaking at it's finest and it's a clear example of why I love films. I can't wait to watch it again. Words can't fully explain how I really feel about this film but they're all I can use to show how I feel, so to show my absolute love for this film, I'll give it a 9.7/10 (a.k.a 10/10), now all I have to do is read the book. also: I really hope Timothée Chalamet gets roles as good as this, I've seen him in other things and he's shown consistent promise as an actor, especially a young one which can be really difficult. I hope Armie chooses roles as good as this, he's obviously a great actor and I hope he now knows this from this film and takes that in a good direction."

I saw CALL ME BY YOUR NAME tonight with a packed auditorium at the Landmark Cinema on Clark near Diversey (in Chicago). The cold weather and snow didn't stop anyone from getting their dollop of ""summer"" lovingly presented in this film. May such memories warm us as time takes us into colder climes."

141,Call Me by Your Name,10,24 December 2017,Love & Reality,"This is one of the sweetest coming of age movies in recent years. I very much enjoyed it, much of it reminiscent of my own youthful years in the Mediterranean. The style of the movie is European clearly, and I was amazed by the fact that both director and actors were able to express this in so many levels. The hot silent days of the summer were very well expressed on the day by day. The slower pace of living life enjoying the moment enjoying the view away from the rush of communication through our modern smart phones and internet was greatly expressed and gave a sense of nostalgia. The core love story is just as sweet as it is sad. The touch and go by the main protagonists the apparent calm period and then the climactic engagement of a loving relationship which inevitably comes to an abrupt end, was just so touching and real. The movie expresses very well the reality of such relationships in the time that it is set, the 80's. Definitely a must watch, two thumbs up for me!"
142,Call Me by Your Name,9,24 December 2017,FINALLY!!,"It's rare to see such a beautiful same-sex love story without being too political about it. it really is about first love more than about gay love. i think that almost everyone have had experience this once in their life whether they are gay or not.And it has a perfect cast. Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet gave a very excelent performance, the way they move and act are so natural and very reflecting of the situation that they had experienced without losing their character. the story could be made as a cheesy hollywood romcom film, but it isn't played that way, it's a film about a growing love without being ""hollywood"". every scene that was played out felt so natural and even some scene somehow felt very poetic.Another film that would portray a state of falling in love as almost perfect as this is Leon Morin, Priest. it was about an atheist who fall in love with a priest. and both are two of my favorite films."
143,Call Me by Your Name,10,23 December 2017,A masterpiece...,"Call Me By Your Name is sure to be one of the best of 2017. The film is gorgeous not only for the script, acting, photography and directing that are great, more for the environment it creates.
 The script, of course, is the first layer of the cake (film), each scene is important to develop the characters. The performances are the second layer of the cake, as it transforms the fetishes, the feelings of the characters written in the script. The direction of Luca Guadagnino is not what most appears in the film, although it is good, so it is with the third layer of the cake. And the photograph, though not impressive, makes the film look more beautiful, livelier and more cheerful, and takes the cherry of the cake to finalize the masterpiece.
 It's a sex spell in the form of a movie. Note 9.6, but 10 in my heart."
144,Call Me by Your Name,8,22 December 2017,mixed feelings,"I was moved to tears by the last twenty minutes or so of this film. The father's speech and the final image of the youth were overwhelming. It is sadly the sort of film that attracts the sort of comment beginning, 'simply calling it a gay movie...' which is deeply patronising to LGBT people. That it is about how millennia of same sex hatred has poisoned many relationships, including this one is clear to me. Emotional abuse and loss of innocence are at the heart of this story, and the romanticism is soured. The actor who played Oliver was not a good choice. He had no ambiguity, and his heterosexual credentials were written like a badge all over him, but he will and has no doubt been praised for his courage on taking on the role. As for Elio he had more inner truth, but it was all acting and no BEING. It is yet another 'Gay' film in the pantheon of a half- hearted mainstream machine that wants to please everybody. Once Oliver was out of the way I felt something, and cried. With different male casting, and men who feel emotions from the INSIDE this could have been a masterpiece. And maybe another director. Too much Bertolucci in image and pace took up too much of the playing time. I like slow films. But too much scenery, and too much faux eroticism ( the male statues of antiquity for example ) ruined many a scene. I give it an 8 for the last part of the film. Before that I would have given it 5."
145,Call Me by Your Name,7,20 December 2017,an artistic lustful romance,"Greetings again from the darkness. Although confusing the two is understandable, there is a difference between a story of romance and a story of love. That's not to say that the two can't overlap; in fact, they often do. In movies, romance is the dish most often served because it's usually more interesting. Watching the flirtatious dance and often awkward exploratory stage of what was once called the rituals of courting offers a writer, actor and director infinitely more possibilities than what we associate with the years of deep connection labeled as love. Andre Aciman's novel is adapted by James Ivory (of Merchant-Ivory fame, and 3 times Oscar nominated for Best Director) and the script leans heavily on romance ... lustful romance, to be specific.Director Luca Guadagnino (A BIGGER SPLASH, I AM LOVE) is an expert at making movies that engage our senses. His movies delicately tease us - they slowly absorb us into the emotions and feelings of the characters. Very few filmmakers have the skill to subtly seduce the viewer, and draw us into the story so that we are no longer merely observing. It's nuanced story-telling at the highest level. Elio's (Timothee Chalamet) family spends the summer at their estate in northern Italy. You've likely never met a more cultured family. His father (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a renowned professor, his mother (Amira Casar) a recognized translator, and Elio himself is a musical prodigy who whiles away the days by transcribing classical music and reading every book he can get his hands on. Oh, he also flirts with the local girls because he is, after all, a 17 year old boy. His intelligence and corresponding wit is of a much older person, standing in stark contrast to his innocence and childlike maturity level with all other pieces of life's puzzle.Elio's world is rocked when his father's newest research assistant, Oliver (Armie Hammer), shows up. An ""Americano"" who offsets his extreme politeness with an unrefined ""Later"" when departing any encounter, Oliver explodes on the scene like a Greek God. He and Elio have an initial passive-aggressiveness towards each other as they test the boundaries for weakness, and more importantly, interest. Things move very slowly as the passion and curiosity brews during their bike rides, walks through the apricot orchards (forbidden fruit), swimming in every watering hole, and competitive banters on intellectual topics. There is a sensuality to most every scene, though those same scenes are filled with unspoken tension.The sunlit beauty as each summer day passes initially masks the emotions, and the stunning setting, people, colors, and music is accentuated by the camera work of cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom. Nature is on display in its full glory; not just through trees, sunlight, and water, but in that elusive and unexplained connection between two people so strongly drawn to one another. Director Guadagnino's film easily slides into the romantic sub-genre of such films as BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, and CAROL, and the artistic approach provides a gentleness that even the peach scene can't undo. Michael Stuhlbarg (who seems to be everywhere these days) has an extraordinary father/son scene near the end which reminds us that each one of us has a story on how life may or may not have turned out as planned. The gut-wrenching pain with sharing that story usually means it remains untold; however, the invaluable lesson is not lost on Elio. First love and first heartbreak bring both emotional ecstasy and emotional devastation, and whether you believe the film's statement ""We have less to give each new person"", you'll likely agree that the use of Psychedelic Furs ""Love My Way"" is spot on."
146,Call Me by Your Name,7,15 December 2017,Oh Man Is This Gay,"Is it really a good time to award this movie anything, considering the Kevin Spacey allegations? Do you really want the firestorm to return to entertainment, Golden Globes.
If you can set aside the homosexual nature of this movie, it is a really effective story of crushes and first love. Though plodding and a bit of a slog, the mood is what you go for. Such as the late afternoon dinners. Swimming in the lake. Listening to rain. This has that coming-of-age sense that ""Man In The Moon"" (the one with Reese Witherspoon). It's heartbreaking in terms of how life does move on even after devastating emotions (well, at that age anyway). And the beauty of simple life in Europe in the 1980's as a teen must've been this charming. Again, this is going to be trashed by Middle America, with good reason. But it is a great film about capturing a time and feel of being overwhelmed with love."
147,Call Me by Your Name,8,7 December 2017,Call Me By Your Name (2017),"As soon as I heard this film receiving some award buzz, I knew that I would have to see it. Interesting film title aside, I really went into this film blind not quite knowing what to expect. Sometimes Oscar films can be a bit baity and overbearing or not worth some of the praise it receives, that is the truth. I can say, that does not apply for this film. I don't know what my favorite film of the year is just yet but I'd except Call Me By Your Name to be in the top ten of the year.This film is about a 17 year old boy living in Italy who falls for an American assistant to his father, who comes and stays with them for a period of time. Elio (Timothée Chalamet), soon realizes that he has feelings for this older man and they begin a relationship. Elio has to come to grips with his sexual awakening and see if a relationship is possible despite being in a relationship with a local girl. There's definitely much more to the film than my horrible summary of it, that's for sure.Its a coming of age film of sorts but feels so fresh and like it makes a point to be different. New face Chalamet is now here to stay, having appeared in both Lady Bird and this film. He is fantastic in it and this happens to be the best I've seen from Armie Hammer as well. I had to just see two minutes of this film to conclude that this was a Luca Guadagnino film, the vibrant color and the gorgeous vacation setting cinematography made it feel like A Bigger Splash, and it turns out to be a spiritual successor in a trilogy to that film.The backdrop of the 80s works so nicely with the film because this was also a time where homosexuality was quite hidden but becoming public. The score and soundtrack for this film is fantastic. ""Love My Way"" hasn't sounded this good since the Grand Theft Auto Vice City days. Once you finish the film, you know that you've been treated to something special and a strong contender during awards season.8/10"
148,Call Me by Your Name,8,12 January 2018,Incredibly immersive,"This movie is really great. Some of the aspects that I like the most was the unusual way that it do somethings. Like the sound mixer, it's a little the detail, but is amazing how this tiny little point chances your whole experience into the movie. The fact that the movie has a kind of ""natural"" sound, without mix of volumes or something like that, makes you fell like if you were there. In fact, this is my favorite point of the entire movie, you fell like if you were there, at the end, it's almost like if you just visit Italy. Those little and apparently without meaning scene, where you just see the character thinking, or the to guys just staring at each other, the unusual way that the storyline is structured make this a complete immersive experience.The acting on the movie is great too, amazing. Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet are fantastic in the film, great chemistry.I have one or two flaws with the movie. Like, ""why is everyone changing the language everytime?"". Well, and the last issue, it's just more of a question. Elio has 17 years, and ignore Armie Hammer real age, the guy has what? 28 at least? Anyway, my main question is: This was probably a pedophilia case, wasn't? lol."
149,Call Me by Your Name,7,12 January 2018,Sensual and Nostalgic Romance Film,"Call Me By Your Name directed by Luca Guadagnino was a very interesting film to me. The general plot is that Oliver (Armie Hammer) goes to stay at a northern Italian villa owned by professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his wife Annella (Amira Casar) to work on his doctorate for the summer. While he is there, he meets Elio (Timothée Chalamet), the 17 year old son of Mr. & Mrs. Perlman. At the beginning, Elio isn't very fond of Oliver and finds him 'arrogant', but soon comes to find that his initial dislike for Oliver is rooted in something much more complex; something that both Elio and Oliver struggle to admit. The settings are completely gorgeous. I loved the 'feel' of their sets for northern Italy, and it has actually inspired me to potentially visit there some day. There's just something about their quiet and secluded town that I found extremely beautiful.The acting and script were decent, sometimes average. I wouldn't say the film's acting is horrible, but I wouldn't call it superb either. However, I felt the chemistry and emotion was there when it counted. I thought Timothee Chalamet as Elio was the stand-out performance, and he really made the film for me. Also, this film didn't need superb acting in order to for it to capture my attention. Once I started watching the film, I fell in love with the characters, regardless of acting. If it was BAD acting, THEN I wouldn't be able to get over it. But at the same time, there are so many things in acting, that I would say it is more of the verbal acting that was average, where as the facial expressions, body movement, pacing, etc. was all very good, and it kept me interested in the two main characters, Elio and Oliver.There wasn't much to the plot ... two men, exploring their sexuality under a shroud of secrecy. I don't think this movie is really one you watch for an intriguing and complex plotline ... it's pretty straight forward, and it's more about the development of a relationship as it pertains to its characters rather than the development of its characters in relation to its plot. I don't know if that really makes sense ... for example, instead of the movie being focused on developing characters independently, this film felt as though we were meant to focus on the growth of the relationship wherein the characters developed with one another. I felt like that direction was correct. It's not like there is NO character development, just that it's not the main focus of the film. Maybe some of you consider their relationship as the plot, which is true, so hopefully you can still understand me. Overall, I really liked the film. To the point where I shed a single tear - I hardly ever cry, and not even concerning just movies, but life in general. I felt a lot for these characters, especially for Elio. If I wanted to rate the film personally, I would give it a 9/10. But I wanted to rate it somewhat objectively. I read some of the other reviews, and a lot of people didn't really like it. I can understand that. If you don't feel a connection between Elio and Oliver, I don't think you will like the film that much. But if you can find that connection, and if you enjoy looking into the complexities of intimacy and sexuality, you will probably enjoy this film. I already plan to see it again. It reminded me of Maurice, the novel by E.M Forster, which I adore. This movie is definitely going to be one that I will re-watch over and over again."
150,Call Me by Your Name,,11 January 2018,One of the best films i've seen PERIOD!,"This is in no way a film about being gay. This teaches its audience whats its like to feel stunning love & lust. (being young) I love the integrity, reserved sexual scenery.. and still it feels so erotic. It's just filled with good people, their intentions towards one and another.... Just wonderful. 
I'm a gal and i'm not gay but i felt every emotion. I so fully understand. Both main characters are desirable, intelligent and beautiful people. 
Aside from the 'small' sensual fundament of this movie.. Pay attention to the professor and his wife.
The parents will give the audience some trust back in humanity. Wonderfully done.
I wish every person had such kind, intelligent and loving mom and dad. My parents were like this. I miss them. btw: i am buying the novel now!I love this movie so much! 
thank you"
151,Call Me by Your Name,5,10 January 2018,Not much happening,It's like watching pretentious big brother. There are some lovely moments but most of the conversation is so generic . If this movie was made 30 years ago it would be more relevant
152,Call Me by Your Name,1,10 January 2018,in a word awesome,U will never bored in this film... but one thing i hate about this film that was a homosexuality
153,Call Me by Your Name,3,10 January 2018,Student film with a budget.,"Don't believe the hype. After all the ""best film ever made/masterpiece/10 out of 10/perfection"" reviews I cannot tell you how disappointed I was. Given the 45 minute drive each way to find a cinema playing this, that's a total of 4 hours of my life I cannot get back.If you've seen more than three art house films (all of which will be better than this) you'll be bored out of your mind. The only people who would give this a 10/10 would be ""I've just seen my first art house film"" newbs, the director's parents, or the director himself, Luca Gaudagnino, who I'm sure spent every moment between takes practising his Oscar acceptance speech. Pretentious (another reviewer here nailed it - ""smug and self congratulatory""), dull, aimless, confused, no stakes, no conflict, no structure... I could go on. And I will.The director was so painfully in awe of how avant garde his film was - yet it really wasn't. All this talk of how ""sensual"" and ""sumptuous"" the film was - it's just not there. It really isn't. So the kid jizzed into a peach. Is that it? American Pie did that fifteen years ago, and it wasn't pretending to be avant garde.There is an expression in poker - don't fall in love with your cards - meaning, don't fall so in love with how amazing you think your hand is that you stop paying attention to what the other players have. And in this case the director fell so in love with his film he forgot to think of the audience, and crafting well turned story points for them.Zero chemistry between the two male leads - Armie looked nervous as hell and the kid was dull. The only person I cared about was the female love interest, played by Esther Garrel - excellent acting on her part. Another classic rookie mistake - not knowing when to end! There were three different endings. And this was after a 5 minute eulogy on heartbreak from the father, who made the same point in about 6 different ways - WE GET IT, ""feel the pain of heartbreak"". I could see Luca behind the lens at this point, mouthing out the words to his Oscar speech.Speaking of the parents - they were cool with this? ""Oh hey Armie Hammer, giant late 20s man staying in our house in a professional context... please have our tiny 17 year old son as your sexual plaything for the summer"". What?If this was indeed an Imdb campaign to hype up the score and sell tickets, please think about the people on the other end - who gave up hours of their precious life to have you take to their brain cells with a rubber mallet.If you want ""sumptuous"" and ""sensual"" go eat a mango. It'll save you fifteen bucks."
154,Call Me by Your Name,,6 January 2018,Very well made but is it that good?,"I have mixed feelings about this film. The strengths are in the performances, score, and cinematography. I felt like I wasn't watching a movie but actually watching real people being documented which is probably the intention. I haven't read the book but based on the movie alone I felt the story wasn't focused. The screenplay isn't structured and it side steps a lot of the things writers generally have rules about where to put things in a film like the inciting incident or character motivations, and this film basically doesn't aim to play by those rules, but rather make you feel like you're living with these people and experiencing their summer in Italy. Sometimes it's exciting, sometimes there's just quiet moments and it's all very real. This will either make it or break it for you, if you don't mind the slow pace and want to see a nice coming of age story with a backdrop in Italy then I'd say give it a try. You could tell this was crafted by someone with an actual European background and not by an American perspective so I appreciated that. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer definitely have chemistry and the romance is strong but honestly I felt like it played it a little too safe? I think this movie has a lot of good things and a lot of mixed things. I can see why people love it but it didn't reach that high for me I admire it for its unique direction and style but wasn't as engaged by it as I was with the Shape of Water so far. 7/10."
155,Call Me by Your Name,8,2 January 2018,'80s graduate student goes Greek on boss' teen son.,"After perusing photos of ""erotic"" Greek bronze male statuary related to a recent archeological find, a live-in summer graduate intern decides to resume his seduction of his liberal academician boss' 17 year old son at his host's lush Italian villa."
156,Call Me by Your Name,,1 January 2018,"Boring, Slow and Long","I just saw this with my wife and three of our gay friends. One of the guys who also read the book, liked the film, but didn't love it. The two other guys thought it was just ok. My wife said it was ok, but was very disappointed based on the hype surrounding it. I thought the movie absolutely sucked and I would have left the theatre if I could have. At least four of us would have switched the film to something else if we were watching it at home simply out of sheer boredom. Everyone agreed that Armie Hammer looked too old, and Timothée Chalamet too young not to be creeped out by pedophilia issues. Chalamet's character is supposed to be 17, which would make Hammer's actions illegal in some places, and just plain creepy in others. I guess that's why the story takes place in Italy. The film is a pretty picture that combines child sex/romance with very slow pacing, interminable still art shots and the very long run time. I would avoid unless you like slow moving European arthouse flicks with a Lolita like storyline. In fairness, I would give this movie a zero while my wife and friends would give it a 6, hence the 3. I have no idea how it's getting so many 10's. It's probably just because of the gay romance theme. If the child character were a girl, people would probably be giving it much lower scores."
