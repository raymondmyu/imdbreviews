0,The Florida Project,8,7 October 2017,The Florida Project (2017),"Boy, did I hear some great things about this from film festivals and from critics I follow on social media. Trailer didn't blow me away but I knew there had to be something special about this film. I haven't seen Sean Baker's previous effort, Tangerine, so I didn't really have a barometer for what to expect. I can safely say the film works so well. It's incredibly well acted, and utilizes a charming and emotional script to convey an experience you won't soon forget.The film follows a young girl named Moonee (played by a really good young Brooklynn Kimberly Prince) and her mom who live in an extended stay motel managed by Bobby (Willem Dafoe). Halley, Moone's mother, has trouble making ends meet and does whatever she can to raise her daughter but her brash personality and lifestyle makes life difficult during their stay at the motel. Bobby tries his best to watch over them but realizes how tough it is keeping them as guests.Its hard to say much more without giving away key plot points. I have to say this film is a joyous good time. The kid performers are mostly yelling loudly and running around on adventures. you know, being typical hyper kids. Its done so well though. I think Baker may have legitimately had the child actors improvise their lines because everything felt extremely natural. Newcomer Bria Vinaite, wow. She is livewire. Love or hate her character, she is loudly unapologetic and rebellious and just wonderfully portrayed. Defoe is also typically great. Bobby is such an identifiable character.Baker uses his lenses to study a part of under-represented America. We don't get a lot of films about struggling families who find it hard to get by, definitely not the typical ""Hollywood"" character story. The film is definitely going to hit a lot of viewers hard at the end. Its a rather beautiful ending that reflects the innocence of the mischievous but ultimately innocent children. This could really be an Oscar contender.8/10"
1,The Florida Project,9,20 September 2017,The Practice of Accepting a Situation as it is,"I had the privilege to catch an early viewing of this film along with a Q&A with writer/director/editor Sean Baker. Many know him from his breakout hit Tangerine (2015); I was sucked into his world since the release of Starlet (2012). Something that he never ceases to portray is the messed up realism that is hidden within our world and the Florida Project capture this in the most purest and colorful of ways.The story follows a ruthlessly mischievous 6-year old named Moonee who, along with a couple friends, explore, disrupt, criticize and takeover a simple hotel complex just on the outskirts of Disney World. She lives with her young, tattooed mother, who seems to have issues of her own, but seems content and manages to pay rent (almost) every week. Taking place over the summer, these kids are free to do as they please, that is, since there parents are not too strict. And being around tourists who can't afford the Disney Resort, they can make a lot of fun out of it. From panhandling money for ice cream to turning off the electricity in the hotel, these badmouthed hoodlums do it all. One thing this film captures well is the freedom children have and how far they go to test the waters of life. It was very easy to get lost in this film, making it completely enjoyable. I was worried about the kids being a bit over exaggerating, but they really weren't and every thing they did seemed natural and true to their character. I especially want to point out Halley, Moonee's mother, and her performance. I have never seen a character like her played so superbly and so factual. You will see as the story unfolds that she is a very complex person who, like a child, struggles to maintain complacency with the people around her.Another element I would like to touch up on is the camera work. By far one of the best storytelling methods for a film such as this that is mostly from a child's point of view. The colours being so vibrant and wide angles that show how big the world really is. The gorilla-style as well really depicts how on-the-go they are and trivial most disruptions are.One last thing I want to touch up on is that there is a number of great shots with a helicopter zooming away. I am unsure if it was intentional or if there was a popular helipad near by, but this was a great part of the film that was subtly used. To me it represented freedom, and escape from the world, referring to how fast it can get away. It is not everyday you come across a film like The Florida Project and I definitely intend on seeing it again, as it is simply rewatchable. Getting a taste of authentic realism in art nowadays is one of the most beautiful gifts we can receive. Enjoy!"
2,The Florida Project,8,18 October 2017,More Baker brilliance,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" has long been a Disney catchphrase. The irony for those living on the road to Disney World is the focus of the latest from ground-breaking filmmaker Sean Baker. Mr. Baker was the creative force behind the remarkable TANGERINE (shot entirely with iphones) a couple of years ago, and his most recent film solidifies his brilliance at bringing us the fringes of society  those we don't typically see on screen. Beyond that, these are the folks many of us pay little attention to in real life.The Magic Castle Motel is a lavender monstrosity that belies the daily struggles of those who live behind its purple doors. It's actually a seedy extended-stay that caters to ultra-budget guests. Included among those are 6 year old Moonee (Brooklyn Kimberly Prince) and her friend Scooty (Christopher Rivera). As we watch them spit on a car below their perch on the motel balcony, we quickly judge these as kids with a bit too much free time and a shortage of parental guidance. As the summer days roll on, we tag along as Moonee leads Scooty and their new friend Jancey (Valeria Cotto) in some boundary-pushing adventures. Their fun ranges from typical kid mischief to accidents with more serious ramifications. The brilliance here is that through the child's eye, we see joy and excitement and fun. We hear the purity of giggles and giddy screeches as the kids bound between tourist traps, ice cream parlors, and rooms forbidden as off-limits. All of this miscreant activity occurs amidst the adults who trudge on simply trying to survive another day. While we might be tempted to recall Cat Stevens' lyrics, ""while the sinners sin, the children play"", it's director Baker that refuses to pass judgment. Moonee's mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) was recently fired from her ""dancing"" job, and is now constantly on the prowl to make enough money to cover the weekly motel bill. She clearly loves her daughter, but is too proud and angry, and just has no idea of how to pull out of this vicious cycle of poverty. The artificial dreams that are prevalent in so many films have no place at the Magic Castle Motel. It's about the next meal and keeping a roof above. Don't go searching for plot here. Instead, at times it feels like a documentary on Moonee or the spirited need for fun and laughter that is in the DNA of kids. We are just following a real kid around, and that's a tribute to the marvel that is Brooklyn Kimberly Prince. She steals every scene and most of the movie  and that's in spite of the terrific performances from Ms. Vinaite and screen vet Willem Dafoe. It's a rare ""normal"" role for Mr. Dafoe, and he makes the most of it as Bobby, the motel's manager. He is also a father figure, mediator of disputes, bill collector, and protector of damaged souls. With no hint of saccharine or Hollywood mush, Bobby is unable to detach emotionally from those who live at the hotel, not because he is soft, but rather because he is human. We see his demeanor change drastically when the owner of the hotel arrives for inspection. Bobby understands the fragility of his own situation due to what he witnesses each day.Director Baker is a master of color use and the blending of abrupt framed images with the handhelds in close proximity within motel rooms and personal interactions. His story (co-written with his TANGERINE and STARLET collaborator Chris Bergoch) never feels condescending, preachy or romanticized. There is no blatant political statement being made. These are folks living their lives as best they are able within the confines of their situation. The police and Child Protective Services are always hovering as a reminder that the next mistake could significantly alter lives. Somehow, the film is both hilarious and heart-breaking. The obvious comparison is to last year's MOONLIGHT, and it could even be viewed as a prequel to American HONEY. Mostly it's a slice of rarely seen life and further proof that Sean Baker is already an important filmmaker, and one that likely has more to say. As for the debate around the final scene, does it really matter? There is no better place for a child to escape reality  even if it might only be in their mind. Sometimes that's the only escape we get."
3,The Florida Project,9,23 October 2017,nope,"Beautifully humane film that at times recalls Italian Neo-Realism, at other times the child-based films that are so popular in Iran. That it was made in the USA, with a real if humble budget, seems surprising and is a testament to the commitment of the filmmakers. Subtly going back and forth between the perspectives of the child and adult characters, the film has, at times, an almost magical realist vibe, though nothing remotely supernatural or surreal transpires. Indeed, this is a film steeped in harsh reality, but also one that captures the almost mystical sense of discovering life on the part of the children and sometimes, momentarily at least, even the adults. On the other hand, the film also offers a very visceral sense of the stress of trying to survive amidst the scarcity of the margins of American capitalism. The acting is incredible, all the more so given that, with the very notable exception of Willem Dafoe, the performers are all either non- actors or unknowns."
4,The Florida Project,,20 October 2017,Over rated,"his got great reviews, Oscar Buzz...... I just didn't get what was great about it.OMFG that movie was terrible! The life of sub white trash who live in a motel on the outskirts of Floridas Disneyworld. A hundred or so unrelated boring scenes of a scuzzy trailer trash hooker / stripper her dirty 6 year old brat and other dirt bags that float around the edges of this toilet. NO plot until the very end..... could have maybe made an OK short film.The symbolism of the millionaires helicopters buzzing past the poor people... OK we get it. We got it the first 3 times.Little to no character development, endless redundant scenes of 3 brats getting into increasingly cringe worthy trouble... It could have / should have been cut down to a 20 or 30 minute short film."
5,The Florida Project,2,27 November 2017,Depressing,"It's a well-made movie, but featuring despicable characters with no redeeming qualities. Except for Bobby (Willem Dafoe). I wish he was the main character, but nope, instead the film focuses on an unfit mother and her obnoxious daughter and their friends making life more difficult for themselves and others. None of them learn a thing, and the mother's defiance to any kind of advice or authority is not admirable at all. She just keeps on making things worse for herself and her daughter, with a ridiculous smile on her face and while throwing up her middle finger the whole time, and getting even angrier whenever she has to face the consequences. She isn't a rebel, she is just an awful parent and clueless human being. Then the movie just ends at its lowest point, and it's obvious that things will only get worse for her daughter, once she is caught by Disney security. As far as the filmmaking goes, it's nicely shot and edited and whatnot. But there isn't much of a story, it's mostly a series of increasingly depressing vignettes. I haven't seen a film with such unlikable characters in a long time (again, except for Bobby). Even Moonee became very annoying, especially when the camera was left on her to improvise (at least that's what it seemed like).The trailer for this film makes it seem like a warmhearted, almost coming-of-age story, even a little bit of a comedy. It couldn't be more misleading."
6,The Florida Project,4,11 November 2017,Hugely irritating and empty,"Let me start with a positive. I absolutely loved Tangerine, it had soul, it had heart, and above all it had emotion. By the end of the film you seriously cared for the characters.However, this film had the completely opposite effect on me. From the first minute until the last, this was an uncomfortable watch. Not because of the subject matter, but because of the cringe factor. The kids were annoying little brats, the mum was an arsehole who got worse, the friend was an arsehole. The only adult who wasn't one was William Dafoe.Using the kids ad libbed acting as a juxtaposition against the more seedy element of the film just felt like a cheap trick.I thought this was going to be one of best films of the year, its actually one of the worst."
7,The Florida Project,2,27 November 2017,Save yourselves!,"I'm only doing this in the hope I can save someone else from making the same mistake I made: Trusting the reviews and going to see this movie. It's sort of like signing up to Yelp to warn others about the rotten tomatoes you were served at a bad restaurant. I fail to see the basis for numerous glowing reviews either for cinematography, story line, or performances. There are no characters whom one can develop any sentiment for, neither the youthfully immoral little girl, the struggling and scamming but infantile trash mouthed mother, nor the paternalistic hotel manager, or other tangential cast members. OK, back to the professional reviews, the review rating in at one out of ten, mentioned a high volume of walk outs, once the audience figured out what kind of movie this was going to be. I considered doing the same, but I was in a good mood and had just shelled out the big bucks to watch this movie. There was supposed to be an ending that packed a punch to the audience's expectations. But there really wasn't, the ending seemed like it was recorded surreptitiously, meanwhile the sadness and depravity of all these characters begins to sink in, and you ask yourself, Why did I want to go see this movie? Just don't!!!!"
8,The Florida Project,9,20 October 2017,"A brilliant character study, that blends a powerful story with great humor","I really liked this film, as unorthodox as it was. The first hour was uproariously funny, before becoming a deep, and poignant study of the millions of lives of Americans who are living on the fringes of society, just barely surviving day to day. There is a shocking lack of cinema devoted to this underclass, and seeing this small film, was refreshing, enlightening, and surprising, and a refreshing contrast to the plutocracy we see all around us today. The performances were outstanding. I am not sure where Bria Vinaite has been hiding, but she was astonishing as the mom, Hailey. Her daughter and all of the other kids were great, and their interactions, behavior, dialogue and play was hysterical. Then it kind of morphed into a more serious story, that was credible, and powerful. Willem Dafoe was his usual masterful self, and played a very real, very likable guy. A tough guy with a heart of gold. I highly recommend this film. Not for everyone. Several people walked out during the film. My presumption was that they either thought the film focused too much time on the kids, or they were living in a state of denial, like so many Americans these days, pretending that this huge underclass does not exist. Regardless, it felt like a story that needed to be told. And it was told very well. Kudos to the filmmakers."
9,The Florida Project,9,9 June 2017,The little brother of Spring Breakers,"Beautiful movie which could be considered a parody of Disney's aesthetic and didactic content. The movie's parody is willingly conventional and at the same time the efforts in directing children, in the amazing cinematography and set design are truly recognizable; still it feels like there's something missing, even though the story has everything it needs to be an entertaining piece about white American trash struggling with ordinary life in a fable-like environment. Actually there is really nothing to complain about, that feel is simply produced by the decay surrounding the lovable protagonist, which is deliberately sugar-coated as only a child's mind could manage it. SPOILER (?): The very final sequence, which I kinda felt to happen few seconds before, is a very well-fitting example regarding the masterful level of Baker's self- awareness in the use of parody as a cinematic striking weapon.P.S. hands up who could ever imagine Willem Dafoe as one of the best Disney's character ever written, in a non-Disney movie."
10,The Florida Project,5,14 September 2017,DaFoe is utterly brilliant but the film leaves much to be desired.,"The Florida Project is the third feature film from writer-director Sean Baker and, while being an improvement over Tangerine and Starlet, The Florida Project is still missing the heart it needs to be an everlasting and impactful film. From his cinematic conception, Baker has had a knack for showing very dingy lifestyles bursting with a color palate that would make George Miller weep. But underneath the colorful array that he includes is a superficial mess of a film. One that thinks it is smarter and more heartfelt than it really is. Telling the story of a young girl living in a by-the-hour motel ran by a seedy motel manager (Willem DaFoe) with a heart of gold and having a drug abusing, prostitute mother doesn't exactly translate to feel good. The young girl decides to let her imagination take wind and shield her from the harsh realities of life. While this sounds like it should hit hard, it doesn't. Not even a little bit. The problem that Sean Baker has in all of his films is his characters. All of them are begging for sympathy when sympathy is the last thing they deserve. While I think the young girl, Moonee, deserves our sympathies, no one else does. Every one in this film has gotten themselves here by their own doing and Baker tries desperately to make us feel for them. It may work on some audiences but it was wasted on me.Overall, this feels like a cheap grindhouse drama that really doesn't do any favors to the actors. The cinematography in the film is top notch and definitely shows that Baker has a visual eye but, as with his previous 2 films, the story is severely lacking. While I definitely think Baker has talent, it doesn't lie within his original stories. For those of you who enjoyed Baker's Tangerine or Starlet, give this a shot. Anyone else, you might want to skip it."
11,The Florida Project,1,13 November 2017,pointless.,"You can't even see the effort to tell a story. OK, let's forget about the story, we're not talking about mainstream movie, so how about an inspiring point of view? or about building interesting characters or bonds between them? Nope. I believe this is very likely the most awful film I've ever seen. It's like someone who picks up the camera by accident and shoot a random home video clips. So boring, pointless and a completely waste of your time. (And I had never seen so many people walking out of a film like this, so I guess a lot of people feel the same way.)"
12,The Florida Project,2,24 October 2017,Disappointed,"I have read several of the high star rated reviews and still cannot understand why this film is so highly rated.Both my daughter and I went to see this film as a "" Screen Unseen "" (This is where you go to see a film at a reduced cost but don't know what film is being shown)Because of the reduced cost these showings attract a large amount of people.When the film started the cinema was around three quarters full after the first 10 mins people started to leave (this is not unusual)by the end of the film there was only around a third of the original number remaining (including my daughter and myself this is unusual)The ending was so strange it was as if someone had just cut off the film with no explanation and a big WHAT! came from the remaining audience, A total waste of 2 hours of my life see it at your peril."
13,The Florida Project,6,1 October 2017,Well-Acted but Somewhat Empty Indie Drama,"I had been looking forward to seeing this new film directed by Sean Baker ever since reading the rave reviews for it that came out of Cannes and Toronto. While I can say that this film is beautifully filmed and features strong acting, it doesn't quite hit the mark. The film is about a poor young girl, raised by a single mother, and her friends who live in a run-down motel close to Disney World near Orlando, Florida. Baker uses a simple and low-key filmmaking style to deliver excellent cinematography. The film has a strong and commanding color palette to its simple aesthetic. The performances on display in this movie are very satisfying for the most part. The child actors do a very good and convincing job, especially given their ages. Williem Dafoe is very good as the manager of the motel, although it would have been better if he had been given more of an emotional range to work with in his role throughout the movie. Unfortunately, the film does have some notable flaws. The tone of the movie is all over the place, with joyous childhood wonder juxtaposed sometimes abruptly with more edgy and mature themes. Such abrupt changes in tone and motif hold back the movie's message to some degree. Some audiences will dislike that the movie is considerably darker than its trailers make it seem, although I was fine with that. The same concern over abrupt changes in tone is also evident in the movie's writing, mixing puerile scatological 'jokes' from the kids with more sophisticated and powerful material. Finally, the film's final scene feels like a cop-out. Without giving anything away, the way it is done also makes one (unfortunately) wonder if it was filmed on impulse, or if the filmmakers ran out of budget.I really wanted to love ""The Florida Project,"" and it's certainly not a bad film, but I just wish it could have been better. 6.5/10"
14,The Florida Project,2,12 November 2017,Irritating,"When I go to a movie, I want to be entertained, inspired or enlightened. This movie did not. I gave 2 stars because the acting is good, but the plot is thin, annoying and stressful. Most of the movie is about unsupervised children acting like brats and getting into trouble. Even the sounds are irritating, either children making noises, to the helicopter pad outside the hotel that constantly had helicopters taking off and landing. Don't see this if you are looking for a feel good movie."
15,The Florida Project,8,20 October 2017,Under The Shadow Of Disney,"It's only fitting that in the shadow of the corporate mouse...a society of people who live on the fringe would exist. In Florida (specifically Orlando) the desperate existence thrives on people who go off the beaten path...and actually get lost. That is where Halley (newcomer Bria Vinaite) and her daughter Moonee (played by another newcomer Brooklynn Prince) exist. Halley...seems to be a club kid who got knocked up by a man who shortly abandoned her. In some tribal/white trash code of religion, it seems she thought having a child would make her grow up. Not quite. Because the princesses' castle is within reach, it's still a world away. And that is heartbreaking. Imagine being a person unable to grow up (like what Disney promotes). Those dreams withered and died, but the worst residual effects remained. Which is the Magic Castle. A hovel of a (what one unsuspecting tourist calls a ""gypsy project"") dump managed by Bobby, played wonderfully sympathetic character Willem Dafoe. Bobby patiently overlooks the ship of fools and sometimes, babysits, though by default. Most who live there have feral children who explore the grounds and beyond out of boredom. The residents here are...they are who you think should live there. Look, this film is about character. There is zero plot, so don't go looking for a story. The reality of the people who live here are brutal. Like...on edge scary where you're not entirely sure you want anyone to exist here. But they do. Moonee is a lovely little girl caught up in an adult world she doesn't fully comprehend, but is forced to deal with. Halley is obviously a broken toy herself. And in a very quiet effective scene, we see glimpses of Halley coming to terms with what the world requires of her as parent (""pepperoni costs money"").This is art at it's highest degree. A well paced, sometimes hilarious glimpses of life at the fray. I really hope Willem DaFoe gets nominated for an Oscar. There is a moment in the film where he becomes the knight in shining armor, unbeknownst to the complaining tenants of the complex. Essentially protecting their children from the monsters that are within grasp. And no one thanks him for it. His character Bobby just wants to make it to the end of the day like everyone else. But he is also...us watching and wanting to hug these people hard."
16,The Florida Project,2,4 November 2017,Can't Recommend,"I consider myself an avid movie-goer and I also write screenplays. I kept waiting for this movie to get better. No story, No goal. No real purpose. This movie got high ratings on several sights. Can't understand it. Basically, kids doing what kids do, abusive parents, terrible ending. The 2 out of 10 was me being generous. I can't recommend."
17,The Florida Project,10,31 December 2017,The Best Movie of 2017,"The premise is simple and the story is basic. It is the irony that a place filled with happiness, excitement and indulgence is proximal to a haven of desperation. The Florida Project has the perfect amount of drama with a dash of gaiety. Everything feels natural and emotions are at its pure realism. It exhibits genuine shallowness and naivete as well as the fragility and hysteria of a child. The exceptional acting is but a testament to what the Director can do. It is a shame if Brooklynn Prince will not get an acting award and it would be ridiculous if Sean Baker won't be the Best Director at the Academy.A non-spoilery tip: In order to appreciate the ending it is worth noting that the story is told through the eyes of a child."
18,The Florida Project,2,23 October 2017,People started walking out after 30 minutes,"I lasted 45............This was the Screen Unseen at the Odeon in the UK tonight. Sometimes you get great stuff like Hidden Figures and Baby Driver........ Sometimes you get some real boring stuff like Manchester By The Sea, Moonlight or this film.Now, I'm not saying this film is as bad as Moonlight, but it's not far off.This may do well in the USA but does not engage a UK audience.The cast seemed very genuine but that was not enough to keep people from leaving."
19,The Florida Project,8,21 October 2017,"""I love you, too!'","A.K.A. Harmony Korine's SMALL CHANGE(?) Or a slice of Italian neo-realism if nearly everyone was unsympathetic. Or maybe a continuation of what Arnold was doing with American HONEY, a look at those who are white and poor and with nothing better to do than be walking, screaming examples of, frankly, why abortion should remain not simply legal but readily available if needed. Baker never passes judgment for a nano-second on anyone here - he probably realizes his audience may do that for themselves - and it creates a disturbing and yet extremely lively cinematic experience.This wouldn't be the same as a book or a play or an album - this is something that needs an active stedi/hand-held camera that can give us bright primary colors and on people at this ""Magic Kingdom"" motel, in particular this very young mother Halley, played by Bria Vinaite in her screen debut, and her innocent-and-bratty daughter Moonee, who are for the most part non-professional actors brought on to be as natural as they want to be - and Baker knows this intuitively. His skill as a filmmaker is giving us nothing but behavior; there are events that happen and do escalate to a climax (something that, frankly, I imagine a lot of people watching this will think it has to lead up to, or is one distinct possibility for where this may lead to), but because we are simply seeing these human beings up there on the screen doing things and acting in this way or that, getting into, err, ""shenanigans"" at the least and criminal acts at worst (and that's not uncommon), it adds to the impact.A lessor filmmaker might throw on a ""lesson"" of some kind, or make the ending a little more syrupy with the acting and music and less of an uncertain beat. Here, Baker is totally confident with his players, and knows Dafoe can act with all of them like it's anything else; why should playing off of them be any different than the major stars he's been acting off of throughout his career? His character, by the way, is perfect as far as nailing this sometimes affable but also take-no-s*** blue collar guy who lives in this life as a manager, maybe against his better judgment but, hey, it's a job (I've been at jobs where I've seen this exact guy, and he and Baker totally get it).It helps too that he's there simply for the fact that everyone else - the ""adults"" who are often terribly irresponsible, but it's in their nature so, so it goes, and the children who have been raised to precisely *not* be raised to do what they do - because he's... well, not a moral center, exactly, but someone needs to be there to divert the occasional old child molester or to tell the eccentric lady to cover up her boobs when sunning by the pool. It's a massive, towering performance where, let's put it this way, he makes himself as natural and loose and playful and WHAT ARE YOU DOING! as everyone else.A part of me thinks I should see this again sometime soon, to take in all of these episodes that Baker lays out, all of these actions taking place over a hot and sticky and beautiful and dangerous summer in Florida. At the same time it is a sharp rebuke to the American dream, as sharp and poignant and dirty as one can experience in the cinema this year. I think my reasoning for wanting to see it is to think: what does Baker want his audience to take away from this tale of children running wild and parents who are at best trying to get by (one parent *does* work as a waitress) and at worst are doing everything wrong for their kids? I think back to Harmony Korine because of things like Kids or Gummo, where the intention is to throw us into a specific (yet very familiar) part of America, where it's a combination of no education and no responsibility and no respect and yet... they're human beings, so how does one go for empathy for them? It's not about connecting with them, or... is it? I know I found The Florida Project thrilling, experimental, daring in how it doesn't LIE about these people, which may be all we can ask for, and it's directed and performed with total confidence. It's a beautifully made slice of rancid life.(PS: I'm still not sure I'm totally sold on the very end, where two characters (spoiler?) finally do visit the Magic Kingdom in the corporate/dream-like sense in Orlando, Florida - I do get the point of it, I get it, but it didn't satisfy me after all of the hardcore realism of what came before, not to mention how it shifts jarringly in the technical sense from crisp 35mm to iPhones) 8.5/10"
20,The Florida Project,9,19 October 2017,MAMI Film Fest Review: The Florida Project.,"Childhood is the most important & innocent chapter in each of our lives. Its where we begin to understand what the world is all about. Its where we learn to speak & when to speak what & hope to get into a school where education makes us realize how the world functions. Now imagine, a Childhood in a purple painted, unclean Motel in Florida, which, incidentally enough, is close to Disney World, a dream of every child out there (mine too as a kid, and I did go there). But the trip to Disney World isn't possible for all & 'The Florida Project' is about such kids, who despite knowing there is magic awaiting for them, have no option but to create a world of magic without any fireworks. Writer-Director Sean Baker delivers one of the FINEST films ever on childhood & shows us a side of a America, not many us usually stumble on in cinema. And guess what, this realistic & affecting film, is among this year's very best films!'The Florida Project' Synopsis: Set over one summer, the film follows precocious 6-year-old Moonee (An Astonishing Brooklynn Kimberly Prince) as she courts mischief and adventure with her ragtag playmates and bonds with her rebellious but caring mother (A Fantastic Bria Vinaite), all while living in the shadows of Disney World.'The Florida Project' is about creating the magic in the world you've born too. Moonee, the protagonist, is foul-mouthed, brash & adventurous. She may not have a school to go to or a family to support her needs, but that doesn't stop her from being fun. She finds her joy in spending time with her mother or creating a ruckus with her ragtag playmates (who also live the same life as hers) or bullying the Motel's Manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe, In A Career-Best Performance). She also binges in ice cream & sometimes, a pizza (minus pepperoni, despite that being the topping she craves for, but its expensive). Moonee makes the most of what she has & reminds us how childhood is what we make out of them. With or Without money, with or without education or, with or without, of course, Disney World.Baker & Chris Bergoch's Screenplay touches upon the bleakness & the monotony on the lives of the poor in America, with gut-wrenching honesty & believe it or not, laugh-out-loud humor. YES, you read that right! Despite the nothingness in the surroundings, 'The Florida Project' uses humor, for the most part, to tell its story. We watch the children go through the same old routine of life, but its shown with innocent humor & a sense of immovable circumstances. Baker & Bergoch's Screenplay is simply excellent. This is an important, affecting & heartfelt film, that really makes you think about kids out there & how one should help the underprivileged. And its done with a hammering impact! Baker's Direction is outstanding. His work is among the year's most compelling efforts. I seriously hope the Academy is brave enough to honor Baker & Co., for their exceptionally fine work here. Alexis Zabe's Cinematography captures the claustrophobic setting with great results. Baker's Editing, also, is perfect. Art & Costume Design are fabulously done & add to the authenticity. Performance-Wise: Willem Dafoe steals the show. Dafoe, an actor par excellence, delivers a career-best turn as Bobby, the Motel's Manager/Father to all his residents. His empathizing connection with Moonee, is the film's emotional core. Subtle & Masterfully Restrained, Dafoe redefines the power of Acting with his stellar work here. He's Oscar-Worthy from start to end. Academy, do him proud! Brooklynn Kimberly Prince is astonishing. She brings Moonee to life with right mix of innocence & brashness. Bria Vinaite, as the mother, does a fantastic job. Her portrayal is natural to the core! Valeria Cotto, Christopher Rivera & the rest lend remarkable support.On the whole, 'The Florida Project' digs deep & takes a piece out of you. This is a brave film, that unfolds in sheer power. Two Big Thumbs Up!"
21,The Florida Project,,31 December 2017,A heartbreaking and absorbing portrayal of the lower class,"This movie, ""The Florida Project"", is one of the very rare movies that pay attention to the lower class in modern America, and it gives a truly natural, realistic, heartbreaking, depressing and absorbing portrait. The six-year-old girl Moonee and her young mother Halley do a lot of ""wrong"" things, but it is unfair for them to be blamed, because ultimately it is not their fault, and they simply lack the necessary education, training and guidance. The society, the government and the upper/middle class should really do something to help them. Besides, it is a shame that such a great movie gets very limited box office. It seems that most moviegoers just want to watch non-existent or purely imaginary stories, like superheroes, fairy tales or star wars, where good always conquer evil, and neglect the significant and pragmatic tragedy that could happen frequently in real life."
22,The Florida Project,5,7 October 2017,nothing new.,"I totally agree with reviewer amrelsherif. this is a slice of ""real"" life movie, where your heart is supposed to pour out to the little charming tyke and her life with her mother. I really don't know any parent who lets their child roam around totally without parental guidance. this is a little girl and her friends, after all. this seems like child abuse to me. nothing rings true and you don't feel compassion for the predicament these characters find themselves in. there is a lot of buzz for willem Dafoe's performance. honestly, for an actor with his ability, this could not have been much of a challenge. peace."
23,The Florida Project,2,8 November 2017,Very Good Acting and Directing but Very Bad Writing,"You can't make a good movie from a bad script. The acting and directing in ""The Florida Project"" are wonderful, but I wouldn't call it a good movie.The movie has no plot. The movie consists of scene after scene of obnoxious kids running around doing bad things, a young woman named Halley trying to earn money by engaging in various shady activities, and a motel manager named Bobby doing his job.The movie does a good job depicting the lifestyle of the characters in their environment, but that's all it does. A movie needs a goal that the characters are trying to achieve. There needs to be some conflict or problem or mystery to be solved. There needs to be a story that holds our interest and makes us want to know what happens next and how the story will end. This movie has no story.Something happens at the end of the movie that really belongs at the beginning because it creates a problem for the characters to solve. It creates a goal that the characters can strive to achieve. That would have been an interesting movie.The other thing that bothers me about the writing is the lack of backstory for the characters. At one point, Halley says something in passing that reveals a little bit of information about her life before the events depicted in the movie, and that's all the backstory we are given for her. How did Halley and Moonee end up living at the motel? Who is Moonee's father, and what happened to him? What made Halley and Bobby the people that they are? It's hard to care about characters when you don't know anything about them.""The Florida Project"" could have been a great movie if only it had a better script."
24,The Florida Project,4,12 November 2017,There's a film and a filmmaker in here somewhere....I think,"First, the good. I'm always pleased to see a movie that talks of a community less represented, and it's clear that there is a filmmakers sensibility in there somewhere, the one that shows these underdeveloped adult children living in a world not unlike the primary coloured plastic toys that the real children play with carelessly, so it deserves genuine consideration. But while there is a visual language of brightly coloured plastic toy worlds, and an endless fascination with the unhealthy fake precocity of the central child character, alongside apparently unconscious musings on the various degrees of emotional immaturity of almost all the adult characters, it doesn't add up to a story. It reads like a documentary (how fashionable) but it isn't, and as such, for my twenty bucks, I feel entitled to more care by the filmmaker.If you have nothing to say, don't make movies, if you do, have the courage to say it, if 'saying' for you means merely posing the questions and not delivering the answers then you need greater skill as a filmmaker, and more respect for the audience. The films ending is the most egregious aspect of the film, in that it isn't an ending at all, its weakness undermining the better parts of the movie and making it even less substantial than it otherwise might have appeared up until then. If we are to revere something just because it is naturalistic and as meandering as some lives, then we don't need storytellers to apply form at all, but that doesn't work for me here. It's not new to resort to a fetish for what appears to be a child/adult, especially a female child, but, others have offered more. If it's a slice of life it isn't an especially illuminating one. I see that it has garnered some real plaudits and I can on,y assume that it does so because it stands defiantly in opposition to the truly dull bland mainstream. But being the opposite of bad doesn't guarantee it's good. It may have more integrity, and be more genuine, but it's just another version of not good."
25,The Florida Project,1,17 October 2017,Saturated Colors and Screeching Children Cursing Obscenities Do Not Mix and Left Me Disappointed,"Seldom have I walked out of a preview screening. But after enduring one hour of screeching, unsupervised children, dripping obscenities as casually as they dripped ill-gotten ice cream, unsupervised by adults who were as misbehaved and irresponsible as they were, I mercifully exited the theater.This film neither amused me, nor held my attention. I kept thinking of the times I was on a flight in which the cabin had a child or two who were constantly crying, or kicking the back of my seat, only this viewing experience was worse, because I was expecting better.In the row to my right was a morbidly obese gentleman with a backpack on the seat next to him filled with chips and other snacks that he dipped into regularly, taking time between bites to laugh uncontrollable at the obscenity laden dialogue, as other members of the audience got up to leave in twos and threes.This was worse than going to a restaurant and selecting something from the menu that I was sure would give me indigestion.I go to films, not primarily to be entertained, but for the impact of drama that consists of conflicts and their eventual resolutions, that also reflect and reveal truths about myself, and the world in which I live.Maybe I left too soon to experience any resolution of conflict, but this so-called ""drama"" meandered aimlessly for a full 60 minutes, while I wished that I could look out the window at the passing clouds on that imaginary flight at 35,000 feet, and order a double Jack Daniels.I started the evening in a good mood, on a full stomach, with high hopes, and left hungry, but relieved to be out in the fresh night air.I did briefly enjoy the fantasy created and alluded to by the lush, saturated colors with references to the Magic Kingdom, but other than that, I could not find anything to like about this very painful experience.I may be in the minority, and perhaps this was too rarefied a creative effort for me to fully appreciate, but life is too short, and my instincts told me that I made the right decision to exit early."
26,The Florida Project,1,30 September 2017,A worthless mess,"I've walked out on two movies that I can remember. This was one of them. At this stage in my life I simply refuse to sit through a movie that has no worthwhile characters and doesn't even try to tell a story. I lasted 45 minutes before giving up. It's about a bunch of bratty kids who keep getting into trouble, and their parents who, not surprisingly, don't know how to set an example. Willem Dafoe is the only watchable character and he's not given enough to do to make him worth watching. Nothing original here. No heart. I suggest people skip this one."
27,The Florida Project,7,13 November 2017,"A bit ham-fisted, but Dafoe shines","I've seen the face of poverty in America, and it has the face of Willem Dafoe. Whether it's Antichrist or The Florida Project, there's a real lack of economic status to be found between the deep crevices on Willem's mug.Perfect, I suppose, for a movie about what it's like to be a poor child or poor single mother in the Greater Orlando Area. Is it ironic they live in the decrepit Magic Castle Motel, so painfully within running distance of an actually Magic Castle at Disney World?The poor kids don't know they're poor until they see what rich people eat or golf towards. They're adorable and cute, they go on adventures without iPods or iPads or Nintento Switches, they make mistakes, and they make friends. The meaning of innocence lost is lost until the final scene which inappropriately adds a robust score as we escape, too, into the world that is outside the theater doors, only to realize we haven't been to Disney World for some time, and we still have a few days of use-it-or-lose it PTO before EOY.It's hard not to think of poorer children, possibly a billion or so more, crawling around trash heaps in Brazil or India or Africa. Is the message that America has lost its way and we have our own poverty problems? Or is the message that it's actually not so bad here, because we have clean water and toilets what flush it?Or should we simply take solace that we will always have a Willem Dafoe to stare into while we wish for a less unjust economic system?"
28,The Florida Project,,7 October 2017,Not good,"Other than Willem Dafoe who lends solid credibility to this thing, it is almost unwatchable. I'm actually surprised children can work on a movie and be verbally assaulted and sworn at incessantly at the workplace. Even at the end of the movie when there could have been a moment of breakthrough to justify the rest of this random event, well, that too was missed. There is nothing redeeming about this unless you want to be assaulted without any insight. Simply offensive. Think about Ken Loach and what tremendous heart he would deliver with the same actors and setting."
29,The Florida Project,1,3 October 2017,Not worth your money,"Most annoying movie, period. Don't waste your money! I had to watch it for a class. It's about a girl and her friends continuously causing trouble for their neighbors and maintenance guy. And somehow they get a way everrry single time. No lessons are learned. But I blame the mother of the girl, who's a bad influence and can't seem to change. Yet it ends somehow in an ideal candy-wrapped fashion. Nothing gained, nothing achieved. The characters themselves have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Moreover, this movie has no heart, just a flat story line, not much plot, bad acting (except Willem Dafoe), weak dialogue, and just emptiness. A third of the audience walked out, when the movie wasn't even halfway through.The cinematography is also kinda messy: a lot of tracking shots from behind and awkward framing. (I get it's supposed to be voyeuristic look but come on, this is a visual medium, man. At least make it somewhat decent). Also, the sound design isn't that smooth. Very noisy and rocky.There was Q&A with the director, cinematographer and actors after the movie. The director apparently strove to capture the feeling of childhood (and also because -fun fact- he liked the Little Rascals). I'm sorry man, but this movie fails to deliver."
30,The Florida Project,,22 September 2017,The instruction manual to my coffee maker has more of a storyline that the Florida project,"General Public: This movie has no storyline. This movie literally made no sense. I might not be a professional movie critic but speaking from a logical perspective, this is a movie not worth wasting your time watchingThe movie's focus is on the girl and her mother. The girls role is seriously exaggerated, no kid of that age speaks or acts like that. Her style of humour is NOT funny to begin with and the movie producers made sure to milk it! She certainly know's how to act so the blame is not on her.Quality over quantity, a popular saying that certainly is not applicable here. A lot of random scenes that attribute no value to the movie. Cant emphasize that enough - what on earth was the point of the old paedophile scene? Or the random helicopters coming and going? Or the random guy who helped the Motel manager move the fridge/freezer? The mother's acting was OK, a representation of a lower class American individual. An adult making irresponsible decisions, yes, we've never seen that in a movie before.1 Good thing though is the shooting of the movie, some nice shots here and there. Very colourful, not worth watching this movie for though. Nothing out of the ordinary. My honest and genuine advice as a regular guy who enjoys good movies: this is NOT worth watching."
31,The Florida Project,5,28 November 2017,"Newcomer Vinaite is a smash as neglectful mother in this over long, uneven take on denizens of a Florida welfare motel","Sean Baker is back as director and co-screenwriter of another one of his unflinching portraits of characters living on the fringe. He covered a lonely porn star in Starlet, two trans people in Tangerine and now a 22 year old denizen of a welfare motel in Kissimmee, Florida, located a hop, skip and a jump from Disney World. Baker's protagonist is Halley played by first-time actor Bria Vinaite who Baker discovered while flipping through her Instagram page. Vinaite is a natural, wholly convincing as a 22 year old tattooed hustler who also happens to have a 6 year old child, Moonee (played by the adorable Brooklynn Prince).Baker's focus is on the rarefied world of the motel and Halley's relationships with the other occupants who are her neighbors and others who live in neighboring motels. The story is told more like a rambling docudrama then a narrative that features a suspenseful plot. Willem Dafoe plays Bobby, the motel manager, perhaps the only anchored presence in an atmosphere of confirmed seediness. It's Bobby who is constantly reminding Halley to pay the rent on time, but the irresponsible mother seems always to be short of cash.A good part of Baker's tale is taken up following the misadventures of Moonee and the other unsupervised children who are left to their own devices while their parents are nowhere to be found. As I mentioned above, Moonee is adorable as a kid who is always testing her mother to see what she can get away with. The kids are sometimes up to innocent fun by hustling tourists for change so they can buy ice cream but their activities often lead them into the realm of juvenile delinquency (this includes arsonthe setting of a fire in an abandoned building not too far away from the motel).Despite the cuteness of the kids, Baker spends too much time focused on their machinations and this distracts from his main storyHalley's lack of insight and decline into criminality. Initially, Halley appears to be guilty of misdemeanors, buying perfume wholesale and selling marked up bottles to tourists in the adjacent mall parking lots. With Moonee in tow, Halley manages to scrape up enough cash from sales of the perfume to satisfy Bobby's entreaties to pay the rent on time.But after she's chased off by a security guard in one of the parking lots, Halley resorts to prostitution to procure enough cash to stay afloat. There's a good scene where she has a falling out with her one-time friend, Ashley (the mother of one of Moonee's friend--also played quite convincingly by another newcomer, Mela Murder) who calls her out over consorting with her tricks (while Moonee can hear everything, separated only by a flimsy curtain inside their room). Halley and Ashley end up getting into a frenzied cat fight, with Halley besting Ashley, resulting in a nice shiner for the ex-friend.Baker does well in chronicling Halley's lack of insight and eventual fall from grace when the child welfare authorities come calling, following accusations of neglect concerning Moonee. The denouement is pretty predictable and one must conclude that Baker still needs to improve on how to build suspense. Ultimately The Florida Project is an exercise in episodic screen writing which might have been more effective minus some of the more drawn-out scenes (maybe 30 minutes of less footage would have done the trick!). The Florida Project is by no means standard fare as Baker is a director of considerable talent. With his impressive casting choice of a fledgling star, Ms. Vinaite, and a confirmed one in Mr. Dafoe, this indie is certainly worth a look, despite its limitations."
32,The Florida Project,9,9 January 2018,young cast and a huge Movie,"This one of the best movie this year a big year if i can say
and small young talented cast that make the movie really remarkable
big thanks to the director as well
good job."
33,The Florida Project,10,14 January 2018,Sean Baker's The Florida Project,"Sean Baker's The Florida Project is an absolutely perfect if not maybe too painfully astute look at what is currently wrong with America today and what seems to have been a problem for far too long and yet little to nothing seems to have been done about it. And no, I am not talking about President Trump, or how he is residing over the country, or giving an overall favourable, or negative opinion on his presidency because that is neither here nor there and does not effect the purpose, or intent of this review one iota. I will just say that after this weekend's faux pas over things said in a meeting that were overheard and made public and these were not exactly words, or language that depict, or show the president in the best kind of light, but all I will add here is that if he wants to remain president and seek a second term, he will really have to be careful about the words that come out of his mouth, whether they be in public, or behind closed doors and that also includes being cautious and considerate about how you use and what you write on certain forms of social media, in this case the one with the cute little bird. There enough said and done. As for The Florida Project, it addresses the long standing issue of poverty in America, and shows an unflinchingly realistic portrayal of the lives of several people, particularly in focus being a young mother named Halley and herv daughter Mooney. People watching this film can come away with many different opinions, or theories based upon what they have just watched. I am personally of the opinion that Baker here is neither glorifying these people and how they live, or personally finding fault, or blaming them either. Maybe there stems a much deeper problem and issue here than what lies on the surface. There are examples of how the motel they live and can hardly pay rent for is one thing, but also how they have no real sense of how to spend, earn, or even save money. If money is so tight do you really need to go out and buy all those cigarettes you are seen smoking, because I do not know about America, but here in Canada they are heavily taxed and if you are anything even close to a chain smoker you probably blow a large part of your monthly income on the deadly and yet very stupid things. You can also look at Halley and her friends and instantly notice that they are covered from head to toe in elaborate tattoos that encompass their entire body. There is more of their body that is covered in ink than that is not. Again tattoos depending on the size and the elaborateness to them are not inexpensive either and again you are not really investing your money here in the best way. Halley also seems to be a person who unfortunately is her own worst enemy by having an extremely rebellious attitude towards any kind of authority, or just basically people in general. While Halley tries to scrape together some kind of income to afford the small room her daughter and her call home, Mooney is meanwhile out with her friends getting into all kinds of mischief just for the sake of doing it, including such things as vandalism, arson and even begging other people for money. Halley you can tell as much as is possible for her, truly loves Mooney and yet she is setting an absolutely terrible example for her by the way she lives her life on a day to day basis and when Mooney is reprimanded by the kindly yet firm manager of the motel named Bobby, Halley just shrugs it off and then seems to forget about it until more problems ensue and what begins as just harmless pranks become more and more harmful and Halley herself also seems to be spiralling out of control with both her temper, her wild lifestyle and just having no sense of self control, or knowing when to call quits on this destructive lifestyle that is not only damaging her, but also her daughter's image of a mother and role model is in very sore and sordid shape. One can argue that perhaps if Halley had continued on with her education, or perhaps done some volunteer work, or gotten involved in some extra curricular activities she would be a lot further ahead than she is right now, but the film asks the question of who is really to blame here. Is it always a government's responsibility to play nanny to it's citizens, or should the powers that be offer more in ways of incentives and encouragement and maybe even social programs to help out, so that these kind of problems don't risk the tipping point. Maybe also the individual needs to be a bit responsible for themselves and try to put their best foot forward in life and not be afraid to try new things to better one's self. There are no easy answers to these questions and yet poverty and the type of behaviour I have mentioned is still on the rise and it is definitely something that needs to be addressed one way, or another. The Florida Project is not always the most easiest film to sit through because of the very disturbing self destructive behaviour that is on screen in front of us. And yet, I was glad the film gave us a no holes barred look at the problem and allows us to think, pray and grasp about the problem at hand. This is a powerful film that should definitely be a wake up call to any and all people in government as well as to educators and parents as well. The performances here are the best of any film this year from mostly a crowd of new faces, but they all do such a fantastic job here and Willem Dafoe as Bobby, is one of my favourite, if not absolute favourite performance I have seen him in. A tender man with a good heart who also knows how to be firm and authoritative when he needs to be and yet he knows the trouble of those around him. This is a powerful film that will hit you hard whether you want that, or not, but there is no denying it's impact and the questions that arise from it. One of 2017's best films."
34,The Florida Project,8,13 January 2018,The Movie Was Good,"Do not understand how some people rated this movie a 1 or 2. Plus, I know what I was getting into, so I see no reason to get up and leave. Maybe, people did not like this subject matter does not exist??? It is true this segment of society is over looked and people pretend like they do not exist.
Sure the mother is not the best mother but have empathy for these people. I thought the story was great and the acting was terrific. No it is not a feel good story but living in this type of cheap motel will give everyone an attitude.
Maybe with more guidance and support these people could go down a different path?
Great story on a segment of society we all choose to ignore."
35,The Florida Project,10,11 January 2018,I'm About to Cry...,"I've never been so happy and sad at the same time watching a movie before. The Florida Project is sensitive, human, real. I watched this 4 days ago and i still thinking about Moonee and her friends. I wish we had more movies like that, i wish..."
36,The Florida Project,9,9 January 2018,The Beauty of Colour and Nostalgia.,"Before I sat down and started to watch this film, i wasn't quite sure what to expect. I figured it would be some Art project that fell short in what is was trying to accomplish. BUT with that being said, this was NOT the case. From the first frame to the final sequence I fell in love with this film. If you have ever been lucky enough to visit that part of the world (Disney World) you will have a sense of nostalgia rush over you. From the moment you see the vibrant colours, the crazy knockoff trinket stores, the freshly paved parking lots you are transported to a more simple time. A time of leisure, pleasure and innocents. With the good always comes the bad and this film doesn't stray away from that. It is a simple story with believable acting and conflict. I can't remember the last time i was blown away by a child's performance. Brooklynn Prince was outstanding, furthermore the entire cast was on point and couldn't ask for a better outcome.I hope this film reaches the audience it deserves. A underrated piece of art that is a must watch for 2017."
37,The Florida Project,1,24 October 2017,Well well well...,"An insight into the life of young girl and her friends as they live day to day under the watchful eye of their young, care free struggling mother, with occasional help from the hotel manager.At least that is what I think the plot is meant to be. After watching it at an advanced preview screening, I'm still not sure what to make of this movie. My friend and I managed to last 30 minutes before walking out, however we stuck at it more than most people. You can see why it's critically acclaimed, the acting was well done, however the plot was water thin at best. However I'd rather watch it over Enders Game or Hot Tub Time Machine 2 any day of the week. Now those are two awful movies*disclaimer* I know I said there would be spoilers, but that's a lie, that implies that something happened in this movie to spoil!"
38,The Florida Project,9,16 January 2018,Very realistic,"I find this movie very difficult to evaluate. There is not too much of plot. It's more like a picture of the inner city. It just shows how life is for many people, adults and children. I can't think of another movie that depicts childhood so accurately. The dialogue between the children and their actions are very realistic. Some of it might be a bit over the top (children being a little too bratty), but most of it is fairly accurate. The scene toward the end with the child crying is amazing; I wonder if they told that kid that her dog died or something to get that reaction from her. This movie shows how people's lives can just spiral downward bit by bit. Acting by all is great. If you want an arc in a movie or some major uplifting feel-good movie, then this is not for you. If you want a few laughs and an interesting, realistic movie with good acting, then this is for you."
39,The Florida Project,10,15 January 2018,Just go see it,This film touched me like no movie has in quite a long time. Bits of the story popped into my head days after seeing it. I loved it from beginning to end.I drive past the area where The Florida Project takes place frequently. Director Sean Baker is a genius; he totally nailed the vibe of that strip of road. I cannot even begin to say how great the acting is & yes to agree with what others have said it captures the joyous magic of childhood beautifully. Do yourself a favor. Just go see it.
40,The Florida Project,7,12 January 2018,Harsh and poignant .Had potential but lacked better character development..,"I am an avid cinema/ film lover of independent , foreign and domestic films(Truffaut, Fellini, Kubrick ,Kurosawa, Hitchcock, etc...). I am also a movie fan ( Lucas, JJ Abrms, Spielberg, PIxar, etc... ) of all kinds. I feel the need to make distinction of the two to give some people context of my impression of this film."" The Florida Project "" caters to film lovers and probably not the casual movie fan. 3 films came to mind in comparison of the subject matter of this film 1) "" Central Station ""(1998) by Walter Salles 2) ""The 400 Blows"" (1959) by Francois Truffaut and 3)"" The Bicycle Thief "" (1949) by Vittorio De Sica. These 3 films are fantastic movies of seeing the world from a child's point of view. They are powerless and are exposed to harsh realities the world as is the case of Moonee in the Florida Project. I truly appreciated the style of the film and Sean Baker trying to paint an honest portrayal or view of a world less seen in film lately. Poverty story lines of late have been well told in films like "" Moonlight"", "" Slumdog Millionaire "" , "" Grand Torino"" and "" Precious"" and all of them are hard to watch at times.  The Florida Project has potential based on the setting and the subject matter. It centers on a white single mother raising her daughter in a low budget motel that is near a Disney World commercial strip where travellers stay at times to go to afford a family trip to Disney World. This is a poetic plot lineto me to show both sides of the world that we live in and creates context and setting for the film. The movie is about Mooonee's mother struggles to hold down jobs and she basically lives on welfare and any means where she can earn $$$ to support herself and her young daughter. It does get bleak and uncomfortable at times. It is honestly portrayed. Giving us a poignant story because it does show a side of life many of us never see. Living day- to- day and week to week in motels is truly frightening. For most of us this is heartbreaking in itself. Once again powerful stuff. Watching children playing together in a setting like this is very unconventional. The portrayal of all the characters is so brutally honest. It does feel like documentary at times of a harsh world. Not for everyone for sure. However where the movie starts to fail for me as it slowly unfolds slowly is by the lack of a better written script fundamentally. It doesn't shed light of a how the characters found themselves in this predicament nor does it really give the viewer a real desire to care for them. I say this unfortunately because I wanted know more. I don't necessarily need a light glossy type writing to make me like them which would downplay their situation I think. But by giving the viewer a sense of why Halley (the mother) is so hardened, vulgar, crass and with her own sense of indignation would have helped me want to me to empathize her situation. Especially since though I am not a parent but I am human and worry for the impact it has on Moonee. This is why I referred to "" Central Station ' and "" the 400 Blows "" and the other films originally. I find this type of story albeit at times uncomfortable or unsettling but extremely compelling. The saving grace for me that kept me interested in the film was William Dafoe's character as Bobby, the hotel manager and Moonee. Bobby gave the viewer a reason to want to believe there is still good in a world of utter sadness. He too is powerless as manager and not owner and therefore has limitations on his influence.. He offers a patriarchal type role but he is limited to help Halley regain any control of her life. It is sad to watch because we are so accustomed to seeing the opposite.That is a redeeming quality of the film too. I certainly did not anticipate a rosy ending for Halley/ Moonee's plight I guess I wanted to see semblance of hope. the film was uneven for me and intentionally so I think. To be bleak contrasted by the bright setting of Florida. Sort of in a Vegas kinda way. It reminded me of "" Midnight Cowboy "" and Dustin Hoffman / Ratso Rizzo fascination with Florida. This was another strength of Sean Baker's vision of this film . I just think this could have been a more rewarding and powerful film by simply giving the viewer more context or bio of each (character ( Halley / Moonee and even Bobby) reached their destination in life. I like an open ending or interpretation of a film to allow the viewer to make their own conclusions but not having understanding of one's past makes it hard. In the end the message does get lost I think for me and others. That being said If it is Sean Baker's intention to do so and not offer insight how to fix this but for us to see it and reflect on the way our society is becoming then I think he did just that. Watch and derive your own conclusions is the only suggestion I can make. Just be prepared to be not being told a singular viewpoint with resolutions."
41,The Florida Project,10,11 January 2018,Best Film of 2017,"NOTESThis is the best movie released in 2017, and I give it an A+. This statement is not one I make lightly and is a conclusion I have reached only after hours of scrutiny and the viewing of numerous films, and I am absolutely appalled it has not been more recognized by the foreign press and the Golden Globes. I hope that the Academy wakes up to what they're missing. Films like this need to be recognized because it is within a limited budget and this type of guerilla-style filmmaking that true artistic freedom is bred. Sean Baker has created a masterpiece in this film, and I hope that all those involved will continue to have doors opened to them.REVIEW""The Florida Project"" is the best film I've seen this year. Sean Baker creates an uncanny feature length peek into childhood in all its innocence, deviousness, naivete, and soul-crushing reality. As I said before, I am mortified that the foreign press have neglected to nominate and recognize this film and its many winning elements. The performances given in this film rival the most refined performances from the most well-trained actors, and the film as a package delivers much more of a punch to the hearts and the guts of its audience than any other film released this year.""The Florida Project"" most likely gets its name from Disney World, which during its construction was referred to as the Florida Project. It takes place in the seedy underbelly of Orlando where Halley (played by an absolutely committed Bria Vinaite) is a young single mother trying to raise her young daughter Moonee (played by Brooklynn Prince who brings a similarly career-making and mind-blowing introductory role as Quvenzhane Wallis did in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") the best she can. Due to unexplained circumstances, Halley and Moonee are living in a rent-by-the-hour/day/week/month hotel appropriately named the Magic Castle run by Bobby (Willem Dafoe). During their stay, they experience life as you would imagine (or fear) life to be in the Magic Castle. In the shadow of Disney World we are given a realistic view into what tourism does to a community.The story is told focused on Moonee, a precocious six year-old who leads her minigroup into all sorts of shenanigans. The children run through parking lots, cross busy streets, and con people for ice cream money. They don't get into any real danger or trouble until they do, which basically summarizes childhood, doesn't it? Moonee is living life as most adults only wish they could - one day at a time. She lives in an environment where she is exposed daily to violence, crime, prostitution, profanity, and everything else from which parents wish to protect their children. Halley is a young unemployed woman who struggles to pay Bobby rent, feed Moonee, and stay out of trouble herself. Above all she is a mother, and despite numerous incidents of what society deems to be neglect in legal terms, it is understood that she is doing her best in her given circumstances.The film floats along with ease and playfulness until something creeps into the frame that seems like it had been looming in the periphery the entire time, we just didn't want to accept that it was there. And when it does manifest itself, it slices and cuts deep until it hurts. There were times I found myself nearly looking away - not because of excessive violence or anything like that, but because I could not bear to be exposed to the pain of the situation. My heart hurt after watching this film, yet at the same time I felt a sense of freedom and longed for my childhood.Dafoe's Bobby is a hesitantly protective landlord who clearly has a soft spot for Halley and Moonee. He is no-nonsense, but isn't really cut out for throwing people into the street when they can't make the rent. Dafoe executes this role with incredible precision and I agree with critics who say it is one of the best performances of his career. However, the real standout here is Bria Vinaite as Halley. Her character carries the film, and within her we see the cruelty of the outside world seep into the innocence Moonee embodies. Within Halley, we see the hypocrisy of government agencies who think they can do a better job at caring for a child than a mother can. Her character brings to light the conflict between adulthood with responsibility and the hanging on to adolescence with a carefree attitude that many adults miss and desperately wish to retrieve. We see in Halley the immense gap in socioeconomic status between Disney World and all its capitalistic Wall Street-like titanesque worship of the bottom line, and the young single mom who didn't win in the hereditary lottery and is just trying to make it in this world. Through the perspective of this mother-daughter relationship, Sean Baker gives an unflinching look into the parts of our society many don't want to see or acknowledge. He subtly hints at the hypocrisy that is Disney - with its commercialism and manufactured childhood it tries to cram down our throats - and juxtaposes it with the true innocence of childhood. Multiple shots portray Moonee sweating and out of breath, which is authentic, instead of the pristine synthetic view of children Disney tends to generate.The film in and of itself - how it was made on a shoestring budget, the title, the commentary on American consumerism - is not a direct critique of Disney, but it does open a lot of conversations and deftly adds to the discourse of what is happening in this country. How are these massive business conglomerates changing the very fabric of our communities, and is it for the better? Baker does allow his characters to benefit from Disney in various subtle ways, but also hints that it is actually at the root of much of their strife. Above all it is a subtle, provocative film that simultaneously warms the heart and reaches deep to expose what's been swept under the rug. I highly recommend this film.See hutchnotes.com for more reviews."
42,The Florida Project,7,10 January 2018,Kind of depressing,"Just saw this movie yesterday and I'm still trying to make up my mind about it..
It reminded me a lot of Ken Loach's ""I, Daniel Blake"", which is also about poor people; a young single mother who ends up trying to prostitute herself to provide for her kids: a friendly, caring older man who helps them out, etc, But, while the adult characters in Loach's film have redeeming qualities and are easy to empathise with, the opposite is true with the parents in ""The Florida Project"".Bobby seems to be the only character with enough maturity and sense of responsibility to look after someone or something and the time and dedication he puts into the management of the motel is admirable. He also seems to be the only adult keeping an eye on the kids while they're outside wandering about, which is like most of the day.I found Haley, Monee's mother to be the most dislikable character of all. She is a terrible person and the worst possible role model for a young girl. The only redeeming quality I can think of is that she does seem to love her daughter (in her own selfish, messed up way) but even though the ending is heart-breaking while you're watching it, once the movie was over, it got me thinking that Moonee was probably better off being taken away from her and living with a more stable family.*The acting was excellent from everyone and a lot of the children's dialogues and interactions seemed so natural they must have been improvised. The cinematography was also mostly great, except for that one last scene which is so weird and unexpected and shot in a completely different way from the rest of the movie, that it ends up being too distracting to hit you emotionally. That cut from Moonee´s crying face to Jancey grabbing her hand in fast-mo to kids running into Disney with shaky, handheld camera and surprised on-lookers breaking the fourth wall just changes the tone completely.In general, I thought it was okay, but not good or great. It guess Sean Baker just isn't for me. The ending left me very unsatisfied.*Also, wtf is up with Haley going to ""apologize"" to Scooty's mum, then asking her for money and beating her up like that when she (rightfully) told her to f- off. Seeing her all bruised up in the end only made me hate Haley's character more."
43,The Florida Project,5,8 January 2018,Eye opening,"I never heard of the movie, so when it was playing at our local discount theater, my husband and I decided to see what it was about. We did not know anything about the film or the story line. Yes, the movie moves a bit slow and there is no action (so to speak of), but the underlying message is both beautiful and tragic at the same time. To see the innocence of these children who live this on a daily basis is eye opening. This is their ""normal"" and are fine with it, however, to the outsider looking in, it is a very sad situation. While it does not scream ""social causes/awareness"", it is very much there in the undertones of this movie. The acting by such a young cast was incredible. To show how the 3 main ""families"" handle the same circumstances in a different manner was done so well, it makes you think at a deeper level on each of their characters. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the film as much as I did and it made me so much more aware of different life is from my own for so many people. Regardless of why they are where they are, everyone struggles and does the best they can or at least believe they are. Having the entire move take place at a motel right next to the ""magic kingdom"" was perfect! I love the sensibility of the motel manager. He did his job, but also showed his compassion. I will be watching this movie again so that I can look deeper into the story and the possible ""take away"". I would recommend watching this movie if you want to be made more aware of some peoples and kids ""reality"". Do not expect to walk away feeling good or angry or frustrated. Expect to walk away with eyes a bit more open and hopefully with a more compassionate heart and understanding to other peoples situations. But again, that is my take on the movie, it is not going to ""entertain"" you, but I hope it does change you."
44,The Florida Project,7,7 January 2018,Good but slightly overrated,"Solid film but not the masterpiece it is praised to be for me. 
It was touching and I cared a lot of the characters and it wonderfully characterized the characters wonderfully. 
Also I loved how the two different worlds, the one of the poor at the edge of society is so close at the world of Disney World, the world of the well-beings. Two different world, that could not be more different.
The acting was great. No doubt about that. Brooklynn Prince is a great discovery and especially during her scenes in the last ten minutes she really got out everything out of her little body. Great job. Bria Vinaite is also a wonderful discovery. She really understood her role and played it very down to earth. Seeing those two it felt like watching a documentary thats how good they were. Then there is of course Willem Dafoe who gives one of his most natural and down to earth performances of his career. But I did not think it was one of the best things of the year, as he is getting universal awards attention. Don't get me wrong, a great performance nevertheless. 
Good editing and a very rough and cold look in general but that was needed for the realistic environment the film creates. Still I had loved to have more on the story side to make it even more appealing to me."
45,The Florida Project,5,7 January 2018,"An Overrated, Empty Movie about Bad Parenting","The trailer and summary of this movie are absurdly misleading. They may make you think this is a beautiful movie about childhood and upbringing, just like Little Miss Sunshine, but it's definitely not like that.Here, we have Halley, a terrible, irresponsible single mother who raises her 7-year-old daughter in the worst possible way in a motel in Florida. This woman says bad words in front of her daughter, feeds her with junk food all the time, doesn't teach anything useful or good. Besides, she prostitutes herself while her daughter takes a bath in the same room. There are no redeeming qualities about Halley. The movie fails to raise empathy for her and for her obnoxious daughter, since it fails to accurately and efficiently develop its characters. I understand this movie tried to show child abuse from a different perspective, but it ended up being empty and shallow. All we see is hyperactive children being obnoxious to everybody and running errands , while their mothers and parents are absent and irresponsible. No background of any character whatsoever. No psychological profile. Only a mother who throws fits when things don't go her way and her daughter who behaves the same way. When you're recording a movie about child abuse and negligence, you have to make sure you'll either make the audience feel some kind of empathy for the child or for the mother. In here, we don't have any. The movie focused too much action on WHAT the characters do, and not WHY the characters do it. Willem Dafoe was basically wasted in this movie. Such a marvelous, talented actor should never be hired just to have a supporting role as a motel manager while the rest of the cast with their mediocre performances have much more screen time. I honestly don't see anything special about Brooklynn Price's performance. She behaved like a kid, nothing groundbreaking about that. And Bria Vinaite as Halley only threw fits and gave the middle finger to people - I won't judge too harshly her performance though, because the main flaw her is the screen script, not her performance - she had to work with what she was given. Cinematography is fine, and so is photography. Beautiful color palette that makes us remind of the Disney World parks. But that just it. What could be a dark yet beautiful movie about child abuse and upbringing became an empty portrait of an irresponsible mother and her obnoxious child. We'll never care about them because the movie didn't care to give us some of their background. It's hard to make a beautiful movie when you don't properly develop your characters."
46,The Florida Project,1,7 January 2018,Too Much Noise!,"Screaming noisy children (Brats,Delinquints). This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I It was irritating all the way through. I cannot understand the good reviews, Award Nominations and Wins. Willem Dafoe is a great Actor but not worthy of Award noms for this movie. It makes me never want to go to Disney World or Florida."
47,The Florida Project,9,6 January 2018,Heartbreaking and Affecting and Real,Http://nickkaminskysblogspot.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-florida-project.html
48,The Florida Project,7,5 January 2018,a montage of moments in the pitiful ordinariness of living in poverty.,"How you see The Florida Project (2017) depends entirely on the lens you use. There are several options: it could be seen as a drama about a precocious free-range six-year old living on the edge of squalor; a reality-mockumentary about the gritty texture of life in the shadows of Disneyworld; or a post-GFC critique film that examines what inequality and hopelessness looks like in what is now Trump's America. Of course, it can be all of these at the same time but the one thing it is not, is pleasant to watch.There is no plotline in the traditional sense, rather a montage of moments in the pitiful ordinariness of living in poverty. Instead of a beginning there is an entry point; the middle has no discernible narrative arc; and the final chapter is inconclusive. Six-year old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) lives with her unemployable stoner mum Halley (Bria Vinaite) in the run-down Magic Castle Motel adjacent to Disneyworld. It is temporary accommodation but most of the residents cannot afford to live anywhere else. The manager Bobby Hicks (Willem Dafoe) is a salt-of-the-earth humanitarian, dealing out tough love and genuinely caring for the residents. Moonee makes mischief just to watch grown-ups react: she is bright, funny, adventurous and likes junk food. The constantly slurred Halley struggles to provide food and shelter while Bobby tries to protect his wards from themselves. The trio are the human anchor points around a series of everyday happenings that are trivial, except that Halley's inability to pay the rent inevitably leads her to renting her body and stealing, and state child welfare authorities intervene.In many ways, the characters and events are not the point of this film. While the three actors excel in their roles, their performances feel like cameo roles or avatars for an underclass of people denied a fair share of their nation's wealth. 'The Florida Project' was the name given to the massive commercial development that became Disneyworld, and using it for the film title is a metaphor for unfinished work. These Disney neighbours have no hope of paying for a ticket inside. The helicopters landing and taking off all day bring the incessant flow of wealthy tourists dropping in for fun but never seeing what lies just outside the lavish gates of this capitalist paradise. Viewers see it all through Moonee's eyes, with camera angles at her height looking up at a world that offers her so little, expecting her to remain dispossessed.Hardly entertainment, this is a deliberately disturbing film. Some commentators describe it as beautiful. It may be so only in the sense that an as yet uncrushed daffodil on a battlefield can provide aesthetic relief from what is ugly. Despite its joyless offering, young Brooklynn Prince shines a warm light into a dark place and Willem Defoe gives a quiet portrayal of unacknowledged heroism. Several viewers walked out of my cinema and it is obvious why. I'm glad I stayed, but the memory is far from sweet."
49,The Florida Project,9,3 January 2018,A Slow-Paced Image Of Life,"It can be very hard to get invested in a film when the sole purpose is to display a setting and have you feel for characters in certain situations, especially when it's not really building to much of a climax. The Florida Project is the epitome of this type of storytelling, but I find these risky ventures extremely interesting. Although very different movies, I've always loved Richard Linklater's style of storytelling, having a group of characters evolve throughout the film, being the only true through-line of the film. The Florida Project does exactly that and I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this film, simply because it felt so real. If you're a true fan of the film medium, then here's why I believe The Florida Project is one of the better films of 2017.Many people go to the movies to get immersed in a world outside of their own, but forget that a generic story isn't always the best story. Sure, movies like Star Wars or Harry Potter are huge events and deserve to be seen by everyone, but when a film like The Florida Project can transport you to a real place and either have you relate to the characters or feel the need to praise your own life in comparison with the ones presented on-screen, I feel like that is just as enjoyable sometimes.Following young Moone (the most central character) as she travels around the grounds of her apartment complex, she must cope with being poorly influenced by a terrible mother, while still enjoying the trouble she causes everyone with her friends. At its core, this is a film about moving on from a life you don't need, plain and simple. If a film like this can't interest you, then I can't recommend it. Personally, I found this film very hard to dislike, mainly due to how it was all put together as a finished product.The grungy look to the movie (almost as if it was a homemade feature) really sucked me into this film. I found myself feeling for each of the characters and loving to hate others. Although Brooklynn Prince and Bria Vinaite are the true standouts for carrying this film, I was blown away by the performance that Willem Dafoe gives as the hotel owner. His interaction with each of his guests felt real. Dafoe has never been better, embodying a man that most viewers can relate to in terms of trying to understand the good and bad in everyone, as well as protecting the vulnerable and trying to be a stand-up guy. The movie isn't without a few minor issues, however.This complaint will seem more like a nitpick, but I feel the need to mention it. It's very hard to make a perfect movie and when you're entire film revolves around characters hanging out at a hotel, it can become tiresome at nearly two hours. I did feel the length of the movie when watching, but upon reflection, I feel that was needed. I found this movie to be draining upon first viewing, but I now feel that's necessary to the film itself.In the end, The Florida Project probably won't go down as an independent 2017 classic as I feel it may deserve, but it's a damn good movie that I feel film lovers should wrap themselves up in. The unique editing styles and committed performances combine themselves together to create a loveable little film. The Florida Project is a fantastic little film that I believe needs more attention. Movies like this don't gain enough mainstream attention, which I have always found to be upsetting."
50,The Florida Project,10,2 January 2018,A hollowed out America - The Future Today,"Quite an extraordinary movie in the now. A hollowed out contemporary America which refuses to acknowledge (actually shuts its eye) those on the fringes and systemic failure to provide strong social programs & safety nets. Its not prophetic; it is.The garish artificial food outlets, bad food, poor mans food, closed medical centres, abandoned derelict candy-coloured houses, half-way motels full of people who've fallen through the cracks or never had the opportunity of good education, good health or a solid roof over their heads let alone a job which pays a liveable wage.Its particularly poignant today as the rich get richer bursting with wealth and the poor become more desperate, scrambling around trying to survive and so few care.The juxtaposition of the cheap bleached motels against the nearby golf course & Disneyland? (fantasyland) over which helicopters came & went as the feral children gave them the middle finger was spot on. Disneylands always been an American mirage and this movie brings people right back to earth with a deliberate thud.Congratulations to Sean Baker, all the actors and those prepared to present an American truth."
51,The Florida Project,9,2 January 2018,The Anti Disney Movie,"MischievousMischievousI like Disney films, yes they paint a pretty picture of life in many films but in others its not all roses. This film is set quite close to Disney world in the cheap motels around the area and it certainly doesn't contain any princesses. This film was brilliantly shot and acted, the characters seemed real and the kids just seemed to do their thing with no forced dialogue. William Defoe was excellent as the motel manager trying to keep it all together, there was no pompous performance or grand opus of dramatic output. This was a subtle yet effective character performance. The kids were brilliant, mischevious yet adorable. Most of the time it felt as if the cameras just followed them around doing their thing. Near the end however I saw one of the best child performances that literally brought me to tears. The film is basically a summer in the life of a mother and daughter who have no money, husband, father, or much support from anyone. I guess if your not interested in watching poor people struggle then this film may not be for you but at the same time there is something more within the confines of this existence on screen. I found it harsh, mesmerising, trying, disturbing, sad and fun all within the 90 or so minutes run time. Its the first film I've seen from this director but I think I will be checking out more. A definite 9 out of 10, its rare to see films like this done in an honest and natural way. Bravo"
52,The Florida Project,7,1 January 2018,A bold and touching film,"The residents of a low-rent motel, near Walt Disney World in the Orlando area, include Moonee (Brooklynn Prince), a trouble-making six-year-old who enrolls other kids to do bad things with her; her single mother Halley (Bria Vinaite), an adult trouble-maker; and Bobby (Willem Dafoe), the hotel manager.Like the French classic ""Forbidden Games"" (1952), much of ""The Florida Project"" is seen through children's eyes. The children of both films seem oblivious to their difficult circumstances and find fun (mischief and trouble) with whatever is available to them.The narrative for ""The Florida Project"" is a series of many small scenes - each telling their own little story while building up to a very powerful dramatic conclusion. While a few scenes could have been cut, the film succeeds in its overall purpose.""The Florida Project"" can also be praised for its fine acting. Dafoe plays against type as he is the most stabilizing force among a community of misfits and troublemakers. In subtle ways, he shows his inner conflict: he is rightly annoyed by the worst behaviours of the residents but he can't help but have a soft spot for them. He even occasionally falls into the role of surrogate father to the various children especially in a gripping scene when a stranger approaches the kids when they're playing.Prince is superb as Moonee, deliberately the total opposite of 'sugar and spice and everything nice'. Her strong work easily recalls other great recent child performances including those of Millicent Simmonds in ""Wonderstruck"", Sunny Pawar in ""Lion"", and Jacob Tremblay in ""Room"".Vinaite gives the film's standout performance as she easily gives the viewer conflicting feelings about Halley. It's really easy to hate Halley for the terrible ways she treats people especially a neighbour who is also a single mother. But there are scenes that show her trying as much as possible to give her daughter as good a life as she can despite very limiting circumstances. Credit for this full characterization can also be given to co-writers Chris Bergoch and Sean Baker (the movie's director).This fine film can also be credited for putting a spotlight on an ignored but growing population: the poor."
53,The Florida Project,7,31 December 2017,Baker's Disney convulsions,"S. Baker's ferocious and dummy Disney Resort life features documentary style and outstanding colouring which is the best thing to experience it on big screen. All different worlds: the joy of childhood, the mud of Florida's middle class and people living at social disjuncture come together is this isolated space with their own vicious circles. And the only escape is to run for another artificial Disney World (personally, I didn't like the ending).
Great show performance by young Brooklyn Prince and Willem Defoe's ""Bobby"" (sort of Disney World designer) who interlink different scenes. Unfortunately, I found Halley's character (played by Bria Vinaite) too stereotipical, but most of all too single-sided, without even making a small character arc (the whole performance is based on smoking, screaming and yelling)."
54,The Florida Project,7,30 December 2017,Great directing and one good performance but not much else!,"This film overall was a little disappointing considering the Oscar buzz that this film is getting, I was expecting a lot more than I got. That is not to say that this film is terrible, its fine erm......good in places but not very memorable. There are two areas that the film is strongest in, Firstly the directing by Sean Baker which is fantastic considering the circumstances of the location. Now I could be completely wrong here but I'm positive I watched an interview with Willem Dafoe where he said they shot the film in a real motel. He continued to say that there were people living in the motel whilst they shot the film, going about their day to day lives. That is an extremely ballsy thing to do because anything could happen whilst filming is taking place. If this is true that is amazing and shows the authenticity that Sean Baker was looking for in the motel setting because thats where all of the film takes place. Anyway his directing overall is brilliant throughout, there are some really nice wide panning shots following the kids on their ""adventures"". As well as some interesting ""hand held"" camera work that is lower to the ground to make us believe we are there on the journey with everyone. Really nicely done. Oh.....just forgot to add.......there is an interesting element to the film which is the location of the motel outside Disneyland. Its as if they are the opposite sides of the same coin in a strange way, quite interesting??Willem Dafoe is a great actor, I'm pretty sure that everyone one can agree on that, and in this film he is no different. He is brilliant in the role as the manager of the motel, going about his day to day routine and making sure that people are ok. Its a great performance that I think everyone can gravitate towards because of his generosity and care for the motel. Unfortunately thats about it for all the good elements in the film, yeah following the kids around the motel is funny at times especially when they set an abandoned house on fire. Apart from that the rest of the film is just fine or a bit boring, mainly due to not being able to connect with the character of Halley. It is essential that you are able to connect with her story and situation otherwise, like me, you don't care at all. In the end your happy that they take her kid away from her because she is horrible throughout the film. There is however one piece of constructive criticism that I will give the film without just trashing it and moaning. I wish that we had more time and focus put onto Willem Dafoe's character, yes what we got was great but I was left wanting more. This is especially considering that the other characters and story lines weren't as interesting as following him around. Take out some of the kids and single mom stuff and maybe add in a bit more Willem Dafoe. That might just be me, oh well.Overall the film is ok........nah actually good 70% out of 100 the directing of the film is probably the biggest strength with Willem Dafoe's performance close behind, however I was left wanting more form his character. I'll probably never watch this again I was expecting a lot more than I got, which is unfortunate considering the amazing response to the film. Its worth a watch but don't rush out and see it!"
55,The Florida Project,6,12 November 2017,A charming and realistic low-fi drama that makes a few missteps but is ultimately a tonally rich and strangely calming experience.,"Sean Baker's realistic, low-fi slice-of-life drama is a beautifully shot and strangely calming experience - especially considering all the boisterous kids, heated debates and generally loud central characters - that's apparent lack of plot isn't so much an issue as it is essential to capturing both the specific time and place of this mother/daughter dynamic and to putting us wholly within the perspective of the central character, allowing us to perceive the events of the film only as a child could and as such be delivered the story almost second-hand; astute viewers will pick up on important cues throughout the exposition-less piece that place each person within the world and connect them to each other in wonderfully honest ways and it's this texture that combines with the background narrative to make a really tonally rich film that has an ambiance that is almost palpable and evokes an odd nostalgia even for those who find the depicted situation pretty much totally alien - the flick does suffers from a few missteps though, the most notable being its off-note and seemingly tone-deaf ending which breaks every rule laid out before it, slipping too far from reality (intentionally so) to be taken seriously, and, while it can be read a couple of ways with a rather obvious metaphor perhaps being the most appropriate, it is a rather sour note on which to end this charming yet honest piece as it seems as though the filmmakers thought we weren't quite mature enough for the true ending. 6/10"
56,The Florida Project,9,11 November 2017,Halley wasn't the worst movie mom by a long shot,"Not a review -- a discussion of the filmI really liked this film though it was hyped by ""What the Flick"" as being great and I found it to be good. I also laughed a lot. The kids stole this film and whoever wrote it knows kids. They also knew how to write about healthy parental love which this film had some of despite the inappropriate profession Moonee's mom was in. Ben Mankiewics of TYT's ""What the Flick"" panel calls her the worst mom in movie history. Here's how I answered that on You Tube: DISAGREE WITH BEN MANKIEWICS' ""WORST MOM"" COMMENT (Spoiler warning)Halley was a great mom in some ways and a so-so mom in others. She swears and breaks rules in front of Moonee-- giving a bad role model but her worst sin is her hooking partly because it's illegal and causes her to be taken away which is devastating to Moonee. When it comes to loving her kid (and by that I mean enjoying being with her, Halley is near the top: games in the rain,, burping contests, taking bikini selfies, taking her with her on her sales endeavors). . . (some of which are fairly harmless). Compare Halley as a mom to the mom in the movie Moonlight. Chirone's mom is a drugged out hooker that doesn't give one s*** about her kid. And Chirone hates her. If he were removed it would be a godsend. Also, I, too, had trouble with the abrupt ending. It was sort of like the Thelma and Louise ending but they didn't get killed (probably just arrested). But it opened up more questions and then just left you there.Basically, Moonie is a happy kid who likes herself . . . likes living. Life is fun. Maybe we should legalize the world's oldest profession like they did in Nevada."
57,The Florida Project,8,8 November 2017,"Seamy underbelly of ""The Happiest Place on Earth""","Very often, to experience the best in cinematic art you have to go small and The Florida Project is the newest, shining example of that.It's a movie that contains only one recognizable star, Willem Dafoe, and was location-filmed in a couple of run-down hotels within a short jaunt of the Magic Kingdom and Disney World. The story is told through the eyes of a trio of small children and centers around their misadventures during a typical, steamy Central Florida summer.Only a mile or so away thousands of children their age get escorted through a wondrous make-believe world filled with Mickey and Minnie, the Frozen characters, and other fantasy archetypes like Cinderella and Snow White, yet little Moonie and Tancy must make their own fun out of what their circumstances afford them, whether that is invading a shuttered condo complex or panhandling tourists for enough change for an ice cream cone.At night Moonie takes long baths while playing with her dolls in the water and shows twinges of bewilderment as she might be wondering about the rustling and odd moans coming from beyond the closed bathroom door. Other reviewers have remarked that The Florida Project is plot-less and episodic, but at the same time it manages to show the colorful big- ness of the world through the children's exuberant spirit while the harshness of the adult world around them spirals through sweeping changes. There is tumult and ambiguity at the end, but at the same time the story ends perfectly and beautifully. The Florida Project is proof that sometimes all you need for a wonderful movie is a camera exploring the layers of the onion of a complex situation."
58,The Florida Project,10,22 October 2017,"pure fun , love and joy of childhood","The Florida Project directed by Sean Baker is about a young, white, single mom Halley ( superb acting by Bria Vinaite), her beautiful, energetic, smart daughter Moonee (superb acting by Brooklyn Prince who live in a Hotel run by manager Bobby (excellent acting by William Dafoe). The love between Halley and Moonee is depicted very well in all scenes. I particularly liked the scenes when mom and daughter run around in rain, drenched , drinking drops of rain water. Bobby is extremely sympathetic towards all his guests and looks out for all the kids who live in the hotel. Bobby is a kind man and helps Halley to maintain residence in Hotel. Moonee and her friends Scooty (well acted by Christopher Rivera) and Jancey ( acting by Valeria Cotto)are excellent and their simple, innocent, childish pranks are very well directed by Sean Baker. The movie shows poor kids having simple fun and running around and doing childish stuff very well. All the actors did a great job. Mela Murder as Ashley who is Halley's only friend did extremely well as her friend and also as Scooty's mom. Ashley after getting punched in the face and hurting has no hesitation in accepting Moonee's genuinely caring and sympathetic ""feel better soon"" with a hug. Florida Project is all above love not costing anything and all about caring for each other. When love is questioned by DCF, Moonee seeks refuge in land of wonder. The movie is great. I enjoyed the script, the entire cast and excellent Direction. Childhood is all about love , happiness, joy and simple fun."
59,The Florida Project,9,16 November 2017,A Touching Look at Childhood and the Complications of Life,"From acclaimed indie director Sean Baker comes this beautifully crafted tale of a little girl, Moonee (Brooklyn Prince), living with her deadbeat mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite) in a Florida motel, the Magic Castle, run by the kindhearted yet grumpy Bobby (Willem Dafoe) and her adventures with her young friends throughout the Floridian backdrop.Many viewers will complain that the film has no real plot, but that's the point of the narrative as the film details the day to day life of the residents of the motel. Right away director Sean Baker throws us into the daily mischief that Moonee and her friends, Dickie (Caleb Landry Jones) and Scooty (Christopher Rivera), get into like spitting on cars, begging for food at a local diner that Scooty's mother, Ashley, works at in order to help Moonee and Halley eat each day, enjoying ice cream and running about pestering the motel residents; especially Bobby and any tourists that happen to stop by. We also get to watch Moonee and her mother perform illegal sales of perfumes (procured legally from a resale shop) at local country clubs and the allusion to Halley performing other illegal activities to support herself and her little daughter which are revealed at the film's end. Baker's film is a harsh look into the poverty of everyday people particularly when the film focuses on Moonee and Halley's exploits.Baker chooses his cast extremely well particularly with Brooklyn Prince as little Moonee. The unknown child star at the heart of the narrative is just like any normal six year old except for her vulgar mouth (learned from her mother) and bad behavior like the aforementioned illegal perfume sales. Moonee is still a sympathetic child as we see how desperate her living situation is and how neglectful her mother, Halley, is which allows the little girl to engage in her disruptive behavior. Little Prince has a wonderful chemistry with all the other child actors and even the relationships with the adults are believable particularly in Moonee's tenuous interactions with Willem Dafoe's Bobby who is the only adult willing to protect her when her mother doesn't bother to correct Moonee's antics. The most heartbreaking moment from Miss Prince comes during the heartbreaking climax when Moonee is faced with being taken away from her mother and decides to run away with her naïve young friend, Jancey (Valeria Cotto), to nearby Disney; the moment Moonee begins to cry makes you want to just hug the poor little girl and help confront her reality.The film's other standout performance is of course from the wonderful Willem Dafoe as Bobby, the Magic Castle's overwhelmed manager. Still one of the most respected character actors since breaking out in the 1980s, Dafoe provides one of his best performances of the recent decade. Portraying a man who obviously has his own troubles, Dafoe imbues Bobby with a kindhearted personality who looks out for the young children (Moonee, Jancey, Dickie and Scooty) despite all the trouble the kids cause and he even cares for Moonee's mother, Halley, though she is vulgar and rude to him; the script alludes to Bobby being divorced as his son helps him out with repairs round the Magic Castle. Bobby is even an unlikely hero demonstrated in him scaring off a local vagrant who has a history of inappropriate contact with minors and though his everyday tasks of keeping life as normal as can be for the residents of the motel.The cinematography is breathtaking from the blue skies and sunshine to the famous Florida rainstorms, gorgeous sunsets, fireworks in pitch dark night to the colors of pink (the prominent color of the nearby Futureland Inn)and purple (the Magic Castle's primary color) and the overall local landmarks of Florida. The camera-work is a bit dizzying as director Sean Baker shot his breakout film 'Tangerine' on his iPhone and that is also true of this film where several shots are hand-held, but there is enough Steadicam to keep your head still.This indie gem will definitely become a classic in its own right."
60,The Florida Project,,8 October 2017,"A magic castle, but, not the one in Florida you're thinking of","This takes place at the Magic Castle in Orlando Florida. But, it's not THAT Magic Castle and this ain't Disneyworld! It's a seedy motel with that name (an amusing scene concerns tourists who think they have booked an official Disney property). Like his endearing TANGERINE, Director Sean Baker is focused on the 'invisibles' who live on the edge of society (the former movie was in shadow of tourist Hollywood, CA). Baker makes great use of the local stores that trade on their closeness to Mickey Mouse world. Cinematographer Alexis Zabe captures the images and the color scheme with some eye-catching compositions. Also, not like the Mickey Mouse club are the kids who populate the motel (and the adjourning dump, Future World - an ironic vestige of the space age 60s).These kids are the focus of the first half of the movie and are quite the camera-family group (even if they sometimes evince 'play acting' from time to time). This is a transient living space and folks come and go, sometimes without consent. The manager of the place is Bobby (Willem Dafoe), who is just as much guidance counselor and animal wrangler as he is the steward of the place (the latter, literally at one point). And, for the first half or so, the rambunctious children take center stage.But, then the focus shifts more and more towards one of the girls Moonee (Brooklyn Prince) and her mom Halley (Bria Vinaite). It progresses naturally enough, but, it's frankly a less interesting story than that of the kids' POV. Another wreck-less loser single mom just isn't that fresh. It's played out well enough and there was a need to portray consequences to the out-of-balance lives we see, but, it doesn't gel with the first half. A last second ditch effort to re-focus on Moonee and one of her friends feels forced. THE Florida PROJECT is still a worthy follow-up to TANGERINE, but it isn't as satisfying in the end."
61,The Florida Project,1,7 December 2017,How awful can a movie be...this defines it.,"The worst movie I have ever seen in a theater - period. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie. None. Even the attempt to portray life in a cheap, slummy motel fails. The children were too happy, too clean, and never afraid. The adults were too articulate. I've seen places like this - and the film did not depict them accurately. Horrible."
62,The Florida Project,10,19 December 2017,"Beautiful, effervescent and touching...One of the year's best.","'The Florida Project' is co-written and directed by Sean Baker and stars child actress Brooklyn Prince as Moonee, a wide-eyed and adventurous 6 year old girl who lives in a budget motel outside Disney World in Orlando, Florida with her mother Halley (Bria Vinaite). These motels are supposed to be temporary residences for tourists but the motel manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe) makes an exception for people like Halley and Moonee because otherwise they would have nowhere else to go. The movie takes place over a summer period as we follow Moonee and her friends on their magical adventures of childhood whilst their parents deal with difficult times. Baker manages to achieve once again what others fail at- Telling a story about people dealing with hardship in this case poverty without it feeling exploitative or overdone. In fact most of the time the audience doesn't even feel like they are watching someone else's version of events, you just feel like a fly on the wall experiencing the children's childhood wonder and the parents struggles. This is helped all the more by the authentic and raw performances across the board. Brookyln Prince is a major discovery here as her portrayal of Moonee and her chemistry with the rest of the cast is off the charts. Bria Vinaite is also impressive especially considering this is her acting debut and that she was discovered on Instagram by Baker. Dafoe has said in interviews that he lived in one of the motels for a week and shadowed a real-life motel manager to ensure that he picked up on the nuances of the people who actually do it. It is very telling in the film as his performance is wonderful and one of the best of his illustrious career. He is the heart and soul of the film as the kind, considerate and caring Bobby.Another thing I really appreciated is the cinematography and the use of vibrant color in the movie which brilliantly reflects the innocence and optimism of Moonee and her friends. It also offers a nice poignant juxtaposition between the characters harsh circumstances and the fact that they live on the doorstep of every child's dream place, Disney World. Initially I did have one reservation about 'The Florida Project' and that concerned the ending. When I first saw it I thought it felt out of place and a bit of a cop out. However, when I thought about it for a little while, just after the movie, in the context of what happens beforehand I came to the conclusion that it makes perfect sense. So to wrap up, 'The Florida Project' is a beautiful, poignant and triumphant portrait of childhood and of the best films of the year."
63,The Florida Project,5,13 December 2017,The novelty wore off,"This is one of those movies where you either really like it or really hate it. The acting and cinematography was great, and the lack of a soundtrack really worked. I had high hopes for this film due to all the positive criticism from critics. However, halfway through the movie I realized there was really no plot, just kids running around Kissimmee Florida doing kids stuff, while the dead beat mother gets railed in a motel room for some money to help pay the rent. The movie had HUGE potential for some deeply moving moments, but it was just all superficial- You can't really care about these characters b/c you don't know why they came to stay at the motel, where's the father. Also, hearing f*** ever other word got nerve-racking after a while. I know there are bad parents but this movie that the opportunity be inspring and heartwarming, to turn dead beat mom in to a better person- what would have been awesome is if the couple that had accidentally booked a stay at the motel had fostered a relationship with mom Halley and Mooney, and had made Halley do a 180 and made her a character you can sympathize with. However, the movie just glides along at a glacial pace, never escaping the shallow clutches of superficiality."
64,The Florida Project,7,4 December 2017,It's not that good,"The Florida Project is good for a while, but then it continues on a path of nothingness. The kids are cute and fun for a little while, but the movie doesn't execute its plot for a good chunk of its runtime. It was fun to watch Brooklynn Prince and her friends go on adventures and get into trouble.Willem Dafoe stole the spotlight every time he was on screen.Bria Vinaite's scenes were good, but I wanted to know more about her character, her story should've been brought more to the forefront.Nothing much happens here except some kids running around and getting into trouble for a majority of the film. The adults have a propose here too, but their stories aren't engaging enough to save this wannabe documentary that tries to discuss innocence and homelessness with no real depth to any of its characters.

65,The Florida Project,10,26 November 2017,Hilarious and heartwarming dramedy indie with career best for Dafoe and amazing debuts by rookies Vinaite and Oscar-worthy Prince,"THE Florida PROJECT (2017) **** Willem Dafoe, Brooklynn Prince, Valeria Cotto, Bria Vinaite, Christopher Rivera, Caleb Landry Jones, Josie Olivo. Wonderful indie dramedy about a Florida motel manager (Dafoe in one of his best and surprisingly low-key, poignant turns) who attempts the daily rigors of his demanding job include keeping an eye on single mother Vinaite (a newcomer worth watching) whose downward spiral lifestyle brings some serious concerns for her free-spirited and hilarious precious daughter Moonee (an amazing natural debut the likes unseen since the heyday of Jodie Foster and Tatum O'Neal and if there was any justice an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress; That Scary Good) causes daily jeopardy for the trio. Filmmaker Sean Baker (who collaborated on the well conceived script by Chris Bergoch) has the air of improvised documentary about his storyline eliciting some truly remarkable acting and a heartbreaking soul running thru it. One of the year's best films."
66,The Florida Project,10,20 November 2017,A genuine slice of life...,"The Florida Project is a simple story with realistic characters exploring the innocence of childhood and misfortunes of the American lower class. Very off-beat and moving. Excellent acting from the child cast and from Willem Dafoe. Definitely pay attention to the narrative because the ending is a mind-boggler, but once its understood the pay- off is authentically raw. One of 2017's best films and one of the most unique films I've ever watched."
67,The Florida Project,8,13 November 2017,"This kingdom has enough magic to make one want to visit, if not quite stay","Having seen Sean Baker's previous films 'Starlet' (2012) and 'Tangerine' (2015) in preparation for seeing 'The Florida Project', there were high expectations seeing as both of those films, while not quite perfect, were very good indeed.The same also goes for 'The Florida Project', after seeing it and not being let down, being more or less what was expected. Not quite one of my very favourite films of 2017 (although actually it very nearly was), but as far as a wildly inconsistent year for film goes to me it's in the better half. It is hard to say which is my favourite or least favourite of 'Starlet', 'Tangerine' and 'The Florida Project', because they are as good as each other and are very good films in their own way. They have the same strengths pretty much and have very little wrong, at the same time it is very easy to see why they haven't connected with everybody.Perfect 'The Florida Project' isn't. Some of the tonal shifts feel a bit forced and abrupt and, although the final act in general is emotionally intense, count me in as another person who was underwhelmed by the ending, which for my liking felt tacked on, tonally jarring and strains credulity too much.On the other hand, 'The Florida Project' has a lot to like. While not as visually unique as 'Tangerine', it's a good-looking film that manages to make a less than attractive setting actually visually appealing somehow. Like with 'Starlet', while it may take some getting used to for some, the sunny and slightly bleached colours and slightly (but deliberately so) off-kilter but very naturalistic filming (that's very evocative and not amateurish like it can be easily mistaken as) was very striking. Appreciated the subtlety of the music, instead of having constant bombast which would have been wrong here.Like 'Starlet' and 'Tangerine', the writing shines once again. Standouts include the ominous tension between the child and adult worlds and the emotional intensity of the final act, that would have resonated even more if having the very ending scene in keeping with the rest of the film. There is a healthy balance of amusing humour, joyous wonder, charming warmth, understated sweetness and touching drama. The story likewise, it really made me feel warm inside, it made me laugh, it surprised me, it charmed me and it moved me.Baker continues to grow as a director, building even more upon the rich texture and intimate detail seen in particularly 'Tangerine' (both there in 'Starlet', but felt deeper with each succeeding film).Acting is uniformly good. Not just from the most well-known name Willem Dafoe giving perhaps his best performance in years, but also from Bria Vinaite giving a performance of searing intensity and especially an astoundingly mature beyond her years Brooklynn Prince who deserves to become a star after this. There is an improvisatory feel at points but this came over very naturally which is pretty incredible really because not everybody is comfortable with improvisation.In summary, a very good film but, despite the positive critical reception, like Baker's previous films it will divide audiences (already has). 8/10 Bethany Cox"
68,The Florida Project,6,10 November 2017,This is a well done film with good acting that doesn't go deep enough to be truly great.,"The Florida Project: It would have been better as a documentary. The Florida Project is compelling, wondrous and bleak. I don't mind bleak. I loved ""Moon"", ""Moonlight"" and ""Monster,"" among other bleak cinema. And like those films, The Florida Project is full of great performances. But to what end? It goes nowhere. The film is a series of concentric plot circles leading to the same conclusion over and over. It plays as a fantasy in many ways. The problem? The situation presented in the film is all too real, and it would have been better as a documentary. The filmmakers find a way to make the dismal landscape of low-end hotels neighboring Disney World visually interesting. Not once did the angles or edits disrupt the excellent performances of the actors. The children were particularly excellent in the film, but the adults also shine. The film wasn't expensive to shoot, but it was inventive. Let that be a lesson to all directors and cinematographers: cranes, planes and helicopters are not needed to produce compelling visuals. The music was pleasant and subtle. Finally, a drama that finds the story compelling enough to not flood the audience with insipid music just in case they didn't get that a war is DRAMATIC! Feel, damn it, feel! I'm talking to you John Williams, and now you, Hans Zimmer (see my Dunkirk review). And guess what? It's less expensive to have simple orchestration and sound. The conflicts in the story reflect the real struggles of real people who have no reason or chance to invest in politics or community, people who never know if they will have a place to sleep or food to eat the next day. In other words, they are people the politicians in D.C., state capitals, the media and most citizens ignore. They are the precariat. I assume the writers (Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch) and director (Sean Baker) made this film fictional so more people would see it. However, if the point was to criticize our capitalist system that leaves too many behind and suffering, then it misses the mark. It's a nice film that audiences will forget tomorrow and nothing will change for the actual people living precarious lives like the characters in this film. The ending to the The Florida Project works, and doesn't. It trivializes the situation of the characters and detracts from a touching moment between two of the outstanding child stars. However, the ending fits with the film's themes of escapism and survival. Go see it and decide for yourself. Rating: Matinée. The film is well done but too long. Perhaps the tedium of events in the film was used to show the tedium of the lives of the characters. But film needs to go beyond a presentation. If it addresses serious issues, it need to blend elements of character, plot and setting to imply a third meaning. In the film's efforts to create dramatic realism, The Florida Project misses a real opportunity to show the problems with our economy and inequality in the world in general. The film skirts above the surface of the issues and lacks the depth and grit to be truly impactful. In the end, its subjects become mere objects for us to wonder over like displays at Disney World. Peace, Tex Shelters"
69,The Florida Project,9,25 October 2017,Magic Kingdom,"Somewhere in the shadows of tourist traps and Walt Disney World is a story waiting to be told. An unconventional, unsettling story about childhood memories within a purple motel filled with the disaffected, forgotten members of American society. It is no place for a child to be raised, but that doesn't destroy the imagination that every child has. Even in the most desolate of areas, happiness can be found.The Florida Project is a profound film. The appropriate spiritual successor to Sean Baker's last film, Tangerine. It's another side of an overlooked portion of our population. Instead of the lives transgender sex workers roaming the streets of L.A. we are introduced to a community of downtrodden, unemployed, poor folks trapped in the heart of American family tourism. They are more commonly known by wealthy Americans as ""white trash"". The breakout star of the film is Brooklyn Prince as Moonee, a really bad little girl of sorts who lives an average childhood in a not so average world, of which she only knows. Her mother is a thief and prostitute who has no business raising children of her own and by the end, the authorities let her know this. Willem Dafoe, in an outstanding turn, plays the manager of the motel. Almost akin to a father figure to all of these people, he keeps order with a stern grip. Dafoe is usually known for playing villains and sickos, so it's especially refreshing to see him play a genuinely decent guy.Sean Baker has matured as a director, for sure. He explores this world with stunning cinematography. He even goes back to his smart-phone roots towards the end of the picture, in what is an incredible montage of the girls running into the Magic Kingdom to escape. This all came without the permission of the park. Now, we know why nothing is ever filmed at the ""happiest place on earth"". I hope Baker is met with celebration, not litigation."
70,The Florida Project,10,18 November 2017,One of 2017s best and most affecting,"An marvellous vision into the working class struggles of the residents at the Magic Castle Motel in Florida, just outside of tropical Disneyworld.Sean Baker' triumphant drama takes us into the poverty of young parents and their adventurous children. Creating a wonderful performance of joy and sadness through this adult story but fantastically illuminated through the eyes of the young.Moonie (Brooklynn Prince) an ecstatic six year old girl lives with her labouring mother Haley (Bria Vinaite) in the purple Magic Castle motel in Kissimmee, Florida, where she and her friends gallivant the colourful Disney established community. Making the world their own playground the modern group of little rascals cause their own array of mischief which brings much irritation to the assertive manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe) and the local tourists.From the maker Tangerine (2015), The Florida Project is a masterpiece of childhood and humane realism, Sean Baker brings the melancholy story down into young level bringing us into the universe of these joyous children. While in the backdrop of the play time, we also see the despairing truth of the poor well-being that these children are living in.The visual marvel of the film is exceptional, the vibrant Florida community full of standout colour schemes in beautiful design of the wonderland from the motel purple to the orange land bright yellow and red. As the kids course around the community it is a tender excursion of these intrepid children's fantasy. This originates from the pragmatic cinematography from Alexis Zabe. A fantastic low level framing bringing us down to the height of these children, entering their playground of a world in delightful perspective . The fluid movement of the camera gives life into the sublime setting and explicit lighting to the Florida ""paradise"".The Florida Project visibly strives in one of the best ensemble performances of the year. Brooklynn Prince along with the rest of her friends gives the best realist child performance since Tremblay in Room, being that innocent and energetic lead at the centre of the films heart. This is also shared by her crass but exuberant mother, as Bria Vinaite phenomenally portrays the straining Haley, we may loose respect for her as the film progresses but Vinaite's performs it brilliantly that still tugs our hearts for the mother daughter relationship. Willem Dafoe's supporting role is another standout aspect to take away, as the defensive landlord, who although may find the small rascals a pain, shadows a caring love for them, which Dafoe provides astonishingly on screen.The Florida Project is one of the years best and most moving films, an instant classic construction of childhood life and poverty. A must see experience with an awe-inspiring range of break-out performances."
71,The Florida Project,,15 October 2017,Genuine and real,"There are a lot of great things to be said about The Florida Project. You have some idea of what it will be about going into it, but the most admirable thing about it is its willingness to explore live through the yes of children in a very episodic manner. Some thins happen that stand out to the children that aren't followed through with, and although it can be a bit jarring at first, it is completely true to the same timeline and process through which real-life events happen. There are a few flaws of the film (and I wish some of the editing would let the breathe film a bit more at times), but overall this is a fantastic film, full of genuine heart and a unique ability to transport you to a very common, very realistic world where you understand everything that it's about instantly."
72,The Florida Project,8,26 October 2017,"Obviously financed by Flaming California, Soggy Texas, and Shot-up Las Vegas . . .",". . . THE FLOR!DA PROJECT is a commendable effort to expose the so-called ""Sunshine State"" in general and ""Disney World"" in particular for the Hell Holes that they are. THE FLOR!DA PROJECT is filmed entirely just inside Disney World, or just outside the misnamed ""Magic Kingdom"" in the purple-painted ""Magic Castle,"" one of its overflow motels. THE FLOR!DA PROJECT reveals that most of the local ""hospitality workers"" are bra-less single moms with tattoos covering half their bodies, who split their time between flipping pancakes for the deluded tourist dudes and turning tricks for them to stretch their paychecks enough to cover the rent for the squalid motel rooms in which they live. The Pre-School Tykes of these deplorable chicks are grossly neglected, as likely to torch the abandoned condo project next door as not. As the flames soar skyward, the moms commend the Young Arsonists with shouts of ""Aren't you excited?! This is better than TV!"" These Lip-Pierced Skanks wear pads instead of tampons, so that they can reach into their hot shorts and whip them out to plaster on the nearest window in public view whenever they get upset at a tourist, boss, or authority figure. THE FLOR!DA PROJECT depicts wide-spread sleaze, sexual perversion, and bed bugs, but it's the single moms misguided visitors need to watch out for the most."
73,The Florida Project,8,16 October 2017,Munchkin Magik,"I wanted to see this film at TIFF this year, but it was all sold out. I am glad it opened recently in Toronto. I was quite moved by the acting and the situations that are depicted. The children are amazing, they live in their own little world that has its own order and meaning. While the adults cope with all their problems and societal conflicts, the kids explore the world that they find themselves in, and try to make the best of it. Bobby as the motel manager, is a tough bloke, but totally fair in his dealings with his clients. Just his facial expressions are enough to give you a massive subtext to the various encounters that arise.We have a magical world in Florida's Disney Land, where peoples fantasies come true. But just kiddy-corner to this, real life with real people is taking place, not all of it pretty. Children need someone to take care of them, but most of all to see them and love them. This can happen in all sorts of environments, not all of them clinically correct by societal standards. The film is a wonderful mirror."
74,The Florida Project,6,11 January 2018,Overrated,"The story takes place just outside of Disneyworld with a group of low life, tattooed people who barely survive at a $38 a day purple painted motel. The one positive note is the brooding motel manager, the great William Defoe. Halley is a chain smoking, vulgar mouthed mother of a little girl named Moonee. She sells cookies to tourists visiting the kingdom of Mickey Mouse. Her daughter gets into some trouble with a couple of adventurous playmates. The screaming is non-stop, and as someone without children, I was worn out by all the noise. I am mystified by all the Oscar buzz for best picture. The movie looks like a documentary about the underclass of America. Unfortunately, the characters deserve little sympathy from the suffering audience. The only heartbreaking aspect is the innocent little children. We cannot choose our parents, and some kids just are born to mothers who should have had the sense to remain childless. You may cry for Moonee in the finale; but at the same time you will curse out Halley."
75,The Florida Project,2,10 January 2018,What a dog!,"I, like a lot of reviewers I""ve read here, found blazingly good remarks about this film. Well acted by Dafoe, yes. By the child actors, definitely. A story of desperate survival, yes, Depressing, but nothing wrong with that. But this movie started at point A and never went anywhere. Nowhere! And then about a minute before the very end of the film - SPOILER ALERT - suddenly blaring ""happy"" music. I immediately was struck with the thought that ""This film is going to end badly."" Not a sad ending, but bad filmmaking. Yep, that's what we got. I mean really - the way to end this film was to have the kids dance off down Main Street in Disney World? Better they had been run over by a car or eaten by an alligator. Jeez."
76,The Florida Project,1,8 January 2018,Bad Parenting: The Movie,"Set over one summer, the film follows precocious six-year-old Moonee as she courts mischief and adventure with her ragtag playmates and bonds with her rebellious but caring mother, all while living in the shadows of Disney World. I knew that this film was trouble from just the first 5 minutes where the kids started spit on a car and yelling on a woman and her child. All the characters are uninteresting and loud human beings that shouldn't even have kids in the first place to begin with. (0/10)"
77,The Florida Project,,4 January 2018,Not sure what is good about it,"This film tells the story of a young girl and her mother, who is living in a motel near a theme park. The residents in the motel are mostly socially deprived people, and the film concentrates on the lives in the motel.The story may be raw and realistic, but it is not very interesting. In fact, I feel rather strongly and negatively about the mother who is quite clearly not fulfilling her duties of care towards her daughter. The mother's repeated acting out makes me dislike her a lot. The only scene that seem really deep from the heart is the final few seconds, but it s already too late to establish a connection with my heart."
78,The Florida Project,4,3 January 2018,please make them stop!,This and lady bird are the last two movies i had to turn off because the characters were so obnoxious. that one lady should have just gotten custody of all of them and whipped their bratty butts into shape. Willem Dafoe had the patience of a saint dealing with them. i just couldn't deal.
79,The Florida Project,5,2 January 2018,Films abrupt ending says it all...,"Director Sean Baker, known for his gritty look at society and/or the down and out, brings yet another such film to the big screen. This time, the characters live in a gaudy purple motel just blocks for the glamour of Disneyland. Moone (Brooklyn Prince - ""Robot-Dog, Airborne"") is a tough, foul-mouthed kid who is as carefree, careless and as rebellious as her mother (Bria Vinaite - ""The Beach Bum"" - 2018). When the cats away, the mice will play, and both continually push the limits of respectable human beings and the guardian/child relationship when not in each others presence. Keeping the motel a float is Manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe). While Dafoe is currently up for a Golden Global as Best Actor, with little to do in this role, it's probable safe to say he won't win this time around. The kids (including Prince, Aiden Malik - ""Secrets and Lies,"" Valeria Cotto and Christopher Rivera) carry this weak and wondering story line, and the abrupt ending to the film is proof this film really didn't know what it wanted to be and/or say. Mela Murder and Josie Oliva successful play follow equally stuck motel mom's. Baker has captured the distraught surroundings and lifestyle of his characters, but I needed more to truly care. The only legitimate reason this film is garnering attention is because Dafoe is attached and little Prince, whom I'm guessing was probably improving most of her scenes, pushes the film along. Even if Dafoe wins a Global, I'd recommend waiting for the film to come to DVD or streaming."
80,The Florida Project,,1 January 2018,WOW....What a great miraculous achievement!,"Absolutely enjoyed! This is another very best film that we are so lucky to have it in end of 2017. I just can't understand how it possible the director could direct a bunch of kids to follow with a almost seemingly non-exist but so subtly crafted screenplay to act so naturally just like a realistic daily happenstance. I just felt sorry for the kids who had to deal with the tough lowlife style with their adults. These kids are so unlucky, they are just like those dogs adopted by the homeless, what a tough luck, man. The great acting of the little young female actor, WOW, what a talented natural born actor, so talented that her performance in this film simply blew us away. What an amazing kid!Salute to the director who made such film just looked so real. The directing is just so seamlessly subtle.What a great script, man. You guys crafted up such a great screenplay that seemed to be actually looked like non-exist. The cinematographic effect through a Big-Brother like camera lens, so technically yet so faithfully caught all the lowlife low class in the Florida Panhandle. I could never imagine there are so many low low class people live and struggle there 24/7/365, trying to get by with whatever means they could have assembled to deal with the dreary hopelessness and, from worse to the worst, lowlife adults in low livelihood only created more lowlives of the kids. It's like a fatal karma, the direction is plunging downward and could never get rid of, a human bondage that could never get out. Lowlife parents only beget more future low lives. Great America is nothing but a mirage.This amazing movie just impressed me so greatly. What a great achievement to all of the participants!!!"
81,The Florida Project,5,31 December 2017,"A typical boring indie film with missed opportunities, nothing new or special","Honestly, they could have done so much more with the characters and situations, there was a lot of missed opportunity in this.It has a funny concept of small children acting older than they really are, but that got old after the first half hour and the lack of plot or any motivation for any of the character's actions really starts to show. It had some mildly entertaining points, but not enough to make up for the boring points. It was also way too long, and would have been so much more bearable if the runtime was cut down a half hour, especially in the middle. I did enjoy the great child actors, especially the lead, and the use of colors in the cinematography to make it seem like this film is seen through the eyes of a child.Also, why was there so much emphasis on the helicopters? That could've lead to something, instead of simply being 'it makes the movie realistic since there's so many helicopter tours around Disney'. They could've pulled back on showing them every 10 minutes, it got pretty distracting."
82,The Florida Project,7,31 December 2017,Cool movie with flaws,"Absolutely LOVED the kids in the film, especially Moonee. Willem was great too. The newcomer Bria over did everything and wasn't very likable and I think majority of the stuff she said and did wasn't believable. I just don't buy anyone would behave that way, i.e. always making things worse when she is trying to survive. She would have been more flirty and manipulative to get by, not fight, argue and curse everyone out that could help her, or worse, could hurt her. That just made no sense and took away from what could have been a much better film. If you are basically on the verge of homelessness you don't fight and curse out the people that could potentially help you. And not just once, but over and over again. I hate characters that just have ZERO self-preservation, like when CPS shows up, she behaves like THE WORST mother ever. Made no sense. One thing that didn't make much sense either was Willem not liking them in the beginning and really wanted to evict them, but then all of a sudden (without a specific event) started to stick up for them.I think the problem with people thinking we should just improv to make it more ""realistic"" don't realize that improv can be as bad as bad acting. This is prominent in the scene where Bria gives Dafoe her late rent and then spat over it. The script (you should read it btw) is short, but then they just added improv and it can be seen as they almost break the line when they start to laugh, but keep going. There are other points where you can tell it wasn't ""real.""It's like the fake pranks online that are so badly acted it takes away form the realism. Or Curb Your Enthusiasm, where a lot of the actors over acts the improv.It really doesn't matter if you are doing scripted or improv work. At the end of the day, it is either believable or not believable. For the most part it was believable, except Bria and the other girl Mela playing Ashley (although better than Bria). The failure is part of the director not to do a better job of getting better (more believable) performances.I did enjoy it and loved the 80-90% realism. Best scenes were with the kids doing their daily adventures.I think the film could have been better by cutting about 30 minutes out, especially a lot of the repeated stuff. Over all very good film, but could have been great if some of the things had been fixed.Like others have pointed out nothing much happens for about 1:40 minutes, and then the predicted ending, totally resulting from Bria's actions over and over and over again. It would have been more sympathetic if she would have acted with the NORMAL mother behavior throughout the film and in spite of that someone called the CPS. The prostitution was fine. It was her interactions with others that drove me nuts. No one would do that to themselves or their daughter.So yes the ending was SAD but I only felt for Moonee, not Bria, as she totally unnecessarily created that situation. And how on Earth did Moonee just run away form the CPS worker?So yes it was emotional (espcially the end), but I wish it didn't have some of the issues I pointed out. But for those who didn't get the ending, it was all in Moonee's imagination, the same way she went on a ""safari"" with Jancey and imagined her own place at the abandoned buildings.In summary, read the actual script and the intentions in there, and you'll see a lot of it never came across in the film, like Dafoe on the verge of losing his job.But despite all the issues, I still fell in love with the kids and their lives so I would highly recommend it."
83,The Florida Project,1,31 December 2017,1 Terrible boring movie - Should be a Documentary instead of a film.,"This film is not something i would recommend except as a Documentary about A Day in the Life of Florida poor trailer trash living near Disneyworld. Sure poverty exist in America but do i want to pay money for a film and watch this as supposed entertainment. Maybe on Youtube or Docu channel.The shocking part is that so many reviews are claiming this as a movie worth a 8 rating which is tantalizing and disrepectful to other real film makers. There is no art to the directing which feels more like someone with a video hd cam walking behind children or long shots that are exhausting, and there is no story plot or any real journey you feel is worthwhile except to show poverty and a group of people that truthfully you prefer to not know about. End of story. Save your money and wait for this on netflixs as most of the people in the theatre walked out. Yes. Walked out because they were bored and not interested. Myself included. 1 star because i liked William Defoe and the little girl. Directing was terrible. Better luck next time esp for 2 million dollar budget."
84,The Florida Project,,30 December 2017,Outstanding Film,"Florida Project is not only a masterful film, it is an experience."
85,The Florida Project,,30 December 2017,Astounding & Captivating,I was not sure what to expect when I began viewing this..but was quickly drawn into the world of children living close to poverty a stones throw away from the 'magic' of Disneyland. Struggling single mothers..who at times are hard to like. But simply put this film tackled the social decay of modern life. However the main focus of this film is the incredible acting by the children..one is easily sucked into their world and at times I forgot this was a movie. It was easy to think I was watching a documentary. This film moved me and reminded me of my chaotic yet dreamy childhood. Many people will not like it..others will be blown away like I was. Once more I must say the children acted so naturally that they were outstanding. I cannot remember ever seeing a film like this before. I hope you enjoy it.
86,The Florida Project,8,30 December 2017,Bizarre First Review of this film....,"Screw will ""WILLEM DAFOE"" - the stereotype ; The man couldn't act badly if he tried - his appearance in a movie is an automatic '3' stars on ANY scale . His usual style (directed and required) is usually some OTP (Over The Top) - ya know, some psycho, off-his-meds-cliche - macho-BS man, but this movie shows, yet again the true depth of his acting abilities.What we have in this movie, is a man who cares, who goes way beyond his job description in order to keep desperate people and kids from demeaning themselves further.I say to you, other critics, that before ya look at this movie and believe it to be either/and/or fantasy or exaggeration - pop down to Florida, have a real look beneath the glitz and the glamour and then have the guts to write a bad review. Tell us all where YOU stayed. Tell me about YOUR neighbours."
87,The Florida Project,10,29 December 2017,The Kids Are Not Gonna Be Alright,"""The Florida Project"" is a social realist drama in the disguise of a lighthearted comedy. It certainly starts out on a high note, with the soundtrack lyrics telling us to ""Celebrate good times, come on!"", as we the audience tags along with a group of kids being the adorable little monsters that kids their age can be.The ""Florida Project"", of course, was a code name for what would eventually become the Walt Disney World Resort, and ""Celebration"" is not just a Kool & the Gang song, but also the name of the Disney-developed community outside the resort. The movie, though, takes places in the real world, just outside Disney's walled garden.It is a testament to the talent of the filmmakers that the movie manages to affect a joyous tone throughout, even as it depict the stark socioeconomic reality of making a living, one day at a time, at the bottom rungs of the social ladder.The kids are having (quite literally) the time of their life, while the movie leaves no doubt about what the future has in store for them. Scooty's mother is working a minimum-wage job, yet tasked with acting as the provider for both Scooty and Moonee. Jancey is living with her grandmother, because her mother is gone (to alcohol, drugs or worse, the movie doesn't say). Moonee's mother Halley earns a living through street peddling, stripping, theft. Later in the film, Moonee sits quietly in the bathtub while her mom prostitutes herself in the next room.The kids are left to their own devices without a smidgen of adult supervision. The resulting mischief ranges in severity from spitting on cars to burning down a building. But throughout this, the movie maintains a comedic slant, and (at least in the cinema where I watched it), the audience was roaring with laughter. It was not until Halley beats Scooty's mom black and blue, and police and social workers show up to drag the screaming Moonee from her mother, that the audience finally went quiet, as the reality of the situation could no longer be denied.The heartbreaking scene continues for several agonizing minutes before the movie finally lets up and dons its comedic disguise again. Out of nowhere, Kool & the Gang soars once again on the soundtrack, as the kids run for their life - all the way into the Disney World Resort, where they will, presumably, live happily ever after. In this final moment, the movie grants us a respite and allows us to forget that Disney World is not the real world."
88,The Florida Project,,29 December 2017,A heartbreaking masterpiece,"As picturesque Disneyworld looms just out of reach over a Florida welfare assisted motel, so too does the prospect of any normal upbringing for some of it's pint sized residents. Sean Baker's The Florida Project exists in a world of pristine pastel promises and lacquered, castle shaped buildings, a colourful, cotton candy paradise that is as tragic as it is eye catching. For six year old Mooney (Brooklyn Prince instills joy and heartbreak in every mannerism) and her friends, this is a kingdom where they run wild, oblivious to the squalor around them and perceiving their surroundings through the idyllic, abstract lens of childhood. Mooney's mother Haley (Bria Vinaite in a scarily realistic depiction of unabashed ratchetness) is a wayward, self destructive girl whose slack, near non existent parenting leaves the girl mostly up to her own devices. Haley loves her, that much is clear, she just isn't built to take care of herself, let alone a daughter. None of this strife matters to the children though, and that's where Baker's film gets its light from, amongst such troubling themes. All of it is seen through their eyes, youngsters who are still half connected to the subconscious and therefore are affected differently by everything. Peter Travers has called this 'the best film about childhood ever', and he may just be right. Much of what we see shows them simply playing, running about and being kids in a naturalistic, unforced way that is enchanting and makes me endlessly fascinated about Baker's methods of direction, as I imagine children are harder to control on set than animals. To say that music is used sparingly here would be an understatement; ninety percent of the film is soundtrack free except an ironic opening credit sequence set to 'Celebrate Good Times', and one jarring musical cue near the end that I won't spoil except to say it's so effective I let out an audible exhale of surprise. The film is episodic too, and although contains visible arcs, is told in a hazy, spare and hypnotic 'fade in, fade out' fashion, drummed into us until we feel the day to day rhythm of this curious and beguiling part of America. Now let's talk acting, which, as you all know is the centrepiece of my cinematic musings. Willem Dafoe is a tower of power as stern but compassionate Bobby, motel manager and guardian angel to this group of lost souls. Dafoe is a seasoned pro and knows never to overplay it, and when things get rough for him to bear witness, his moments of quiet devastation are incredible. He's also the comic relief in bits and the steward of a very irregular township, it's a delicious role for any actor to get, and he's about long overdue for an Oscar, so... hint, hint. Prince is an unbelievable find, showing uncanny control and focus on camera for someone her age, and when it's time for the third act emotional beat-down, she hits every note pitch perfect. Vinaite seems to have no acting experience before this, a choice which Baker also went with in his fiery debut Tangerine from a couple years back. She's great too, turning a role that could have been one note into something way more complicated and sad, like a tragic fallen angel. I'd also toss cinematographer Alexis Zabe's name into the Oscar race, as she beautifully captures this really strange looking area in surreal, eye popping colour and always from angles the seem like a child's POV a la Terry Gilliam. Between his debut and now this, Baker is gathering momentum in leaps and bounds, and he's quietly released the best film of the year so far, no easy task in the same year as a certain SciFi masterpiece. Florida Project is intimate, focused, loosely spun yet gravely affecting, important, playful, both cinematic and anti cinematic, and something of a small miracle. Seek it out in theatres, even if you have to drive out to the local art house venue."
89,The Florida Project,8,28 December 2017,Through the eyes of the children...,"Children see the world that surrounds them better than the ""grown ups"". They tend to create with their unique talent, a world of joy, a constant game, that makes everything look beautiful and joyfull; their own trip in making ends meet in daily life. They love more and make friends much easier. They are ""fearless"" in a unique way, but they still get scared, since they see the injustice of the wrongfull world they live in, and make no mistake, they also understand how that affects everyone.We see these children live in a place, not so beautiful, not so friendly as it should have been, a trashy place that lacks of the basics. But what an irony, just next to their residence, lays the largest playground of the world, a place they have never visited. Yet it seems to be far away and somehow unecessary...they have their own ""creations"" to play with.You can see deep inside the eyes of the mother, not an indifferent person, not a ""bad mother"" as many may characterise her, but an individual that tries everything to survive, not for her own self, but for her little angel who she loves unconditionaly. She struggles alone, she has no one to support her directly.This is a wonderful film. It calls to us, as viewers, to keep our eyes wide open and see what is going on. To understand the chaos of being without support, the gap that exists, forshadowed by a false progress and prosperity. Is there truly a salvation for all these?At least a temporary ""shelter"" may be found by a child's innocent yet truly mature heart. A shelter of colour and castles, noise and music. Not for having fun but to hide among the many, among ""the masses"", disguised, became unrecognisable in that ephimeral fairytale of well being."
90,The Florida Project,10,22 December 2017,"Under a darker shadow of Disney World, sits The Florida Project, about a poor child at a colorful motel","For tourist cities like Orlando, Florida and Anaheim, California (both are homes to Disney theme parks), everyone assumes that since both places have large businesses that generate profit, then everyone living there is well. Well...that's like assuming because there are a lot of wealthy celebrities living in Hollywood, then everyone must be just as well off. The honest truth is that, like any high population centers, there are wealthy and poorer areas. What they have in common is that both are filled with people chasing the American dream. What exactly draws them in is up to them, but for those living in Orlando or Anaheim, they are probably hoping to catch a bit of that Disney magic, hoping it can inspire them.Both places are also filled with several motels, restaurants, gift shops, and anything that can take some advantage of the tourists. A lot of people work in those places and some even work at the parks. And of course there are those that only live under the shadow of the Disney castles, accepting it as a part of life as they go on with their own goals. In the case of The Florida Project, we get a viewpoint from the lowest end of the economic spectrum.In Orlando, there are sets of low-end motels that also act as housing. For those places that don't have the budget of a Marriot or a Hilton, they try to lure in people by replicating the Disney experience by adding bright colors or themed names like Futureland or the Large Orange. The majority of the story takes place at the purple-colored hotel called the Magic Castle. Among living there is young mother Halley (played by Bria Vinaite) and six-year-old daughter Moonee (played by Brooklynn Prince)It's established from the start that Moonee is mischievous and badly behaved, constantly cursing at adults, mooching off of tourists, and just causing trouble. It doesn't help that her mother does nothing to nurture her and even encouraging her. The closest thing to a father figure is the building's manager Bobby (played by Willem Dafoe) whose only doing so reluctantly to ensure that rent is paid. What's worse is that her mother doesn't want to work and uses Moonee to help for extra cash. Over the course of one summer, Moonee goes trough trials and hardships of gaining and losing friends, dealing with her mother, and trying to make any situation fun.We've seen a lot of movies about childhood and even of bad children, but we rarely get one like The Florida Project that examines that at such a young age. But what's scarier is that there are families with kids that are like that. The Florida Project feels like an honest look at that kind of situation. Putting it within the background of the gate of Disney World adds a lot more style that's visually interesting (both ironic and a relic of another time). But let's talk about the three big stars.First on Willem Dafoe, who does well, playing a man who you can tell really wants to help those in his motel, but also knows that there's a line between a landlord and a friend and often can't cross it. I can tell that people watching this will have mixed emotions towards him, but I'll let the audience decide. Next, Bria Vinaite as the young mom, is a lot like many parents we've come across; the ones that have already given up and are just trying to get to the next day, regardless if anyone's hurt. Even the one thing she cares for, her child, is not even safe from her toxic lifestyle.Finally, little Brooklynn Prince as Moonee does more then a great job; she takes the material, a lot that a child shouldn't even have to deal with, and emotes in every fashion that's natural. I'd love to see just how director Sean Baker coached this little girl into understanding the dark material without spoiling the innocent side of her that's present. It would have been easy to simply make her a bad seed and nothing more, but see's like a well built mess that only her environment could have made her. Though your mad at her in some parts, your more likely to be mad at just how she got there.I'll give this ten motel tourist traps out of ten. It may not be the easiest sit through, but The Florida Project presents the opposite effect of successful towns in an engaging way that most filmmaker would have been afraid to tackle. Check it out and get a better understanding about mischievous children...and their innocence."
91,The Florida Project,1,19 December 2017,Most walked out,"This is the story of a bratty six year-old Moonee (Brooklyn Prince) living at a crummy motel with her appalling mother Halley (Bria Vinaite- cast from her outlandish presence on instagram), and motel manager/father-figure Bobby (Willem Dafoe). These motel dwellers are a new kind of welfare recipient / working poor demographic. Some are what in the US are commonly known as ""Trailer trash"", others are battlers on struggle street. While this situation should be fertile ground for look at modern USA, the film is a slapdash and unengaging portrait of life on the fringe. A very low 'production values' condescension to the range of real people caught in this precarious position.Casting involved asking folks from the community if they were interested in becoming involved at the local Target Store (like Snowtown- but a far inferior result). It looks to be highly exploitative of the young actors, with the film makers obviously egging them on to behave badly.Willem Dafoe who has always impressed me is ok but he's not given much to do. One suspects he lent his name to the project for a large fee and a very short shooting time, probably a day or two. Apart from that, there's lots of cigarettes, foul language, tattoos and naughty kids to enjoy, but no real plot or character development. The many rapturous professional reviews for this film are unfathomable to me and many others. Reading the IMDataBase audience posts, huge numbers of people walk out. Being one of that substantial number of the under-whelmed myself, I would suggest saving your time, money and compassion. A shocker."
92,The Florida Project,1,18 December 2017,Pointless Waste of Time and Money,"This movie has no plot, no message, and none of the characters have any redeeming qualities. A couple in front of me left halfway through the film, and I wish I had done the same. This film is awful."
93,The Florida Project,9,5 December 2017,"This is a magic kingdom? It's one that's filled with drama, despair, downside, and prayers for hope!","""The Florida Project"" is one film that touches your emotions as after watching you feel some pain as you see a segment of society that has pain and prayers for hope are needed to help with their dreams of life. This proves that life is rocky and no bed of roses for many as it's only thru hope and interaction that staying alive can be obtained.Set in a summer in Florida on the outskirts of Orlando it follows the life of little Moonee(Brooklynn Prince) a 6 year old who enjoys adventure of playing with others and doing mischief with other kids. As Moonee's meals are given to her by the local diner when leftovers are found. And miss mother Halley(Bria Vinaite)is no angel she's a white trash welfare cash strapped mother who's on her last legs of support for her and Moonee both, it's really sad and somewhat tragic to see this situation. As day after day and each week both live out of cheap low end rent hotels along a Florida strip highway on the outside of Disney world.The only hope is the interaction and caring comfort and tough love that hotel manager Bobby(Willem Dafoe with his best performance yet) brings to the plate on the table, as each day goes by Bobby sees the need for help and he only hopes thru guidance and looking out for little Moonee that it will bring some change to Halley as it's a struggle for Halley to pay weekly rent to Bobby even though she lives a playmate life.Overall ""The Florida Project"" is a showcase film to watch to see how the poor in society live and struggle with despair and drama, yet with interaction and love and hope from individuals like Bobby and little Moonee hope and dreams are possible as dreams come true thru luck as it's a sight of happiness and escape as one can see from the picture's end."
94,The Florida Project,8,30 November 2017,A hard cake to swallow but the icing is pretty,"For me I didn't immediately click with the story but the quality which caused this barrier early on ultimately became of one the films main assets. This film is unique in its presentation of the events and whilst I tried to catch hold of a thread of narrative I soon realised the film is less of an actual story and more of an immersive dip into a very particular world. Once you become familiar with the films tone it is much easier to appreciate the piece as an observant piece of art. The film follows a community living within a low-cost motel struggling to keep a head above water in a world where the basic needs are met in a haphazard way. More importantly, the film captures the ingenuity from both the children and the adults to create good times and how they relish the freedom within a rule-less micro-society in which they live. The story loosely follows a young mother called Halley (Bria Vinaite) trying to keep up with her weekly rent as her charmingly anarchic daughter Moonee (Brooklyn Prince) turns the run down town into a playground and chance for exploration. A lot of the films energy comes from the exceptional performance by Prince who manages to capture so many qualities of childhood so perfectly that I found her performance to be almost nostalgic. Her performance was not just child-like it also expressed an inner maturity that comes from a challenging upbringing where no hardship is hidden. Halley at one point resorts to taking bikini shots in order to sell herself online and involves Moonee in fun of the photography process. Interestingly when moments like this occur the film doesn't tonally condemn her actions. What is presented is an interesting documentary-style of conveying the extreme and unhealthy parenting methods from mother Halley but without inferring any judgement either way. The film seems to shine a sympathetic spotlight however on all the characters through Willem Defoe's Character 'Bobby' who runs the Motel. Bobby is conflicted through his duty to collect rent and maintain order but is almost a vehicle for the film to express a strong empathy towards the characters who act out against the system but are unable to change their status. I think it is a fascinating element of the film that whilst everything feels uncontrived and raw the action is surrounded by garish colour and quirky backdrops. A lot of the shots in the film where taken from down low and often you where able to take a child's perspective in the scene. The choices made with lurid building colour's and clothes effectively show the world through a child's eye, viewing everything as an opportunity for imagination and adventure whilst remaining oblivious to the hardship of the real world. The detail in this film is breath-taking there are so many small touches made with props or script which make the events feel so real to watch. If this film was a picture you could zoom in for miles and still find details that make up this richly constructed world."
95,The Florida Project,8,29 November 2017,A fascinating look at childhood and poverty,"A charming and moving depiction of poverty near one of the supposed happy places in the world. Disney World is nearby but Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) lives in a different realm. She hangs around an extended stay motel with her friend Scooty (Christopher Rivera). The Magic Castle is run by the friendly manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe) who looks out for Moonee and her troubled mother Halley (Bria Vinaite). Moonee seeks out trouble spitting on a car of a resident in a neighboring motel where she meets Jancey (Valeria Cotto) who becomes a third member of their crew. Moonee shows Jancey all the fun places to go including the ice cream shop where they beg other parents and patrons for enough change to buy an ice cream. Halley, Moonee, and Scooty eat free food from Scooty's mom Ashley (Mela Murder). Moonee is allowed to run free and cause mischief while Halley struggles to find a job. Bobby continues to cover for Halley and steer pedophiles away from the group of kids playing around the motel. Halley comes up with scams to make money to continue to pay her weekly rent. Moonee, Scooty, and Jancey sneak into an abandoned apartment complex and Scooty uses a lighter to set fire to a pillow in the fireplace. The fire gets out of control and sets the whole complex on fire. Scooty acts suspiciously when he gets home so Ashley suspects he had something to do with the fire and decides that Scooty should not be running around under the influence of Moonee.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
96,The Florida Project,9,29 November 2017,Like seeing the world through a very poor 6-year-old girl's eyes!,"'THE Florida PROJECT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An indie drama directed by Sean Baker, and written by Baker and Chris Bergoch (the same duo that also brought us the 2015 critical darling 'TANGERINE'). It tells the story of a 6-year-old girl and her friends, that live in a motel community of extended-stay guests (in Kissimme, Florida), one summer, with very little adult supervision from their parents. The movie stars Brooklynn Prince, Willem Dafoe, Bria Vinaite, Valeria Cotto, Christopher Rivera and Caleb Landry Jones. It was shot on 35mm film, with just a $2 million budget (although Baker admits one crucial scene was filmed illegally on an iPhone). It's received a limited theatrical release in indie theaters, nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics (much like 'TANGERINE' did), and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards as well. I found it to be a very moving film.The story is set during the summer, in Kissimmee, Florida, at a cheap motel with a small community of extended-stay guests. One of those regular guests is a 6-year-old girl named Moonee (Kimberly), who lives at the hotel with her single mother Halley (Prince). Moonee receives very little parental supervision from Halley, and runs around the hotel doing pretty much whatever she wants with her friends, almost completely unsupervised. With the exception of the caring hotel manager, Bobby (Dafoe), who helps Halley look after Moonee, and the other children, from time to time. The movie tells Moonee's story, that summer.The film is intentionally very slow-paced, and seemingly aimless in it's storytelling. Over the course of the whole movie we learn so much about what it's like to be a girl like Moonee though, in that kind of living situation. The film is like seeing the world through a very poor 6-year-old girl's eyes. It's seemingly very natural and realistic, at pretty much all times too. It's almost like watching a documentary, and I wonder how much of the film was improvised for that reason too. Dafoe is great (like always) as the central male character, and Kimberly is very impressive in the lead too. I definitely recommend it."
97,The Florida Project,9,28 November 2017,The kids are the pure beauty of this movie,"As someone already wrote in these reviews, the kids stole this film. Magic!!! When kids are in the story almost the main characters, it is inevitably that we will be involved emotionally in it. The movie starts with old, but still good theme ""Celebration"" by Kool & The Gang, which gives us sign that we will see something what is worth seeing. When speaking about the music, it ends also with that theme, but in the other version, orchestral, made by Lorne Balfe. Not to write about all what I've seen, but it is enough to say that there are many good people outside and everyone can come into some bad situation and it is good to help if you can and if you are in that position that you can give some help. Such behavior is shown through Willem Dafoe's character, motel caretaker Bobby. Not to forget to mention that he is good as in every role he's played. After playing Jopling in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", where he is unrecognizable and incredible good as a bad guy, here is very recognizable as we know him visually, but this time as a good guy who has a big heart. As I wrote in the title of summary, this film shows us the pure beauty of life through every child shown in it."
98,The Florida Project,8,26 November 2017,Taking The Mickey,For once I seem to have watched the same film as the majority of those who have expressed an opinion here. I knew nothing about the film or indeed anyone associated with it either behind or in front of the camera with the exception of William Dafoe but when it opened in London I checked IMDb to attempt to ascertain whatever I could about it. What I read was mostly positive but I was disappointed when neither the National Daily paper I take nor the London Evening Standard deigned to mention it but chose to devote space to inferior - albeit 'commercial' titles. I found a strong documentary 'feel' though it was clearly scripted and acted brilliantly by largely non professionals. It belongs squarely in the 'indie' camp and very near the top. Well worth a second viewing but though more than worthy of Oscars it will probably have a tough time getting ignored.
99,The Florida Project,9,20 November 2017,Well Done,Willem Dafoe delivers a fantastic performance and Brooklynn Prince Valeria Cotto and Bria Vinaite do as well. The story line is quality and the chemistry of the characters is solid. Lots of smiles.The movie is thought provoking and pulls the heart strings. A worthwhile movie and perhaps one to have on the shelf at home.
100,The Florida Project,8,18 November 2017,Birth of a Con Artist,"The Florida Projects follows the adventures of a six year old girl, Moonee, over a summer living in a motel with her deadbeat mom. We are able to view the world through her eyes and see it with the excitement that she does. Moonee is perhaps the most profane six year old you'll ever see, yet she is incredibly endearing. The scary part is that you can see what she is becoming without ever being aware of it. She manipulates people without really trying or realizing that she shouldn't. It is because her only role model is her mother, who is perhaps the worst role model a young impressionable girl could have. Moonie is being taught how to behave by watching how her lazy deadbeat mom treats others and herself.Willem Dafoe excels as the motel's manager, Bobby. He is a good person who tries to do what is best. He represents perhaps the only good influence on Moonee, though she is unaware of it. Dafoe should get an Oscar nomination for his excellent work.The most tragic aspect of The Florida Project is that Moonee's mom really loves her. She wants the best for her, but she doesn't realize that she is hurting Moonee by shaping her in her own image. The best thing she could do for Moonee is to get out of her life, but she loves her and can't face that fact.There isn't an abundance of plot throughout the film as it operates more as a series of connected stories, but those stories are impactful and emotionally gripping throughout."
101,The Florida Project,8,17 November 2017,The Florida Project: social awareness documentary about the the poor community that lives just outside Disney World,"Produced by B.F.I. a documentary drama that paints a perfect picture of life from the outside but dig a little to reveal a slice of disadvantaged lives and the damaged environment from the inside. This is an authentic social awareness documentary about the the poor community that lives just outside Disney World, the focus is the rundown motel being used as low income housing. Willem Defoe is the very likable motel manager struggling to keep control and order but has affection for the tenants, he maintains great chemistry with all the tenants but particularly the latchkey child character 'Moonie' played by unknown actor Brooklyn Prince, who has little adventures and is always getting into trouble and her mother character 'Hayley' played by unknown actor Bria Vinaite, who represents the under life in Florida  single mum, young, poor, heavily tattooed. She takes odd jobs, including sex work to pay bills from week to week. Hayley is a real disgrace and clearly not ready for motherhood.At the end we see Moonie being collected to be taken into care but she escapes and runs away to Disney World. The ending is an abrupt black screen, leaving the audience to decide what happens next. I enjoyed this look at the world mainly from a child's point of view, but not in an entertaining way, very much in the same way as 'I Daniel Blake' did for me. It's a tough watch where 5 audience members walked out at various times during my screening (I can't say whether it was too tough for them, or whether it just wasn't their cup of tea due to lack of exploding cars)"
102,The Florida Project,9,15 November 2017,A pure and honest film with some amazing performances,"Ironically, I saw this film because my first choice sold out at the theater. I had seen the trailer but wasn't excited to see the film because it focused on poverty, something I'd prefer not to think about. But I'm really glad I saw this beautifully honest film. The film is set at a motel near Orlando, but there are many motels like this one all across America (including a couple very close to where I live).The film tells the story of Mooney, a six-year-old girl living with Hailey, her single unemployed mother, in a motel that rents week to week to families that cannot afford an apartment of their own. The story is told from Mooney's point of view to the point where you feel like you are a child again. No other film has made me recall the summers of my own childhood quite like this one. Despite the many harsh struggles depicted in this film, it captures the freedom and joy of childhood in a touching way. The most surprising aspect of this film is the three powerhouse acting performances. Two come from complete newcomers to acting, Brooklynn and Bria, as daughter Mooney and mother Hailey. And the third is from Willem Dafoe as Bobby, the motel manager who is also a part-time mediator, guardian angel, enforcer, and comedian. These three performances are just so pure, honest, and amazing - they really carry the film and its message.Hailey is one of three mothers in the film, and Bria brilliantly conveys Hailey's character flaws and chaotic emotions. The other moms are the moms of Mooney's close friends Scooty and Jancey. The various experiences of the three mother characters compare and contrast the sacrifices and mistakes of single mothers faced with poverty. It will be interesting to see what the future brings for Brooklynn and Bria, given this great debut."
103,The Florida Project,8,13 November 2017,"""To all who come to this happy place: Disneyland is (not) your land""","A cynic would contemptuously advise you to never bet against the 'Slumdog effect': audiences and Academy members exposing themselves to a film foregrounding the difficult living conditions of impoverished communities around the world (provided the telling is joyful enough to not make us wallow in it TOO much), and subsequently showering them in awards as a form of social penance. This doesn't have to diminish the truth of the stories being told, or the quality of the telling. Still, it can be difficult for the discrepancy between lavish gala celebrations of films about extreme poverty not to rankle. Still, if there were ever an (almost assured) awards darling poised to embrace the irony head-on, it's Sean Baker's The Florida Project, and its parable of families broken and defeated by the 'American Dream' slumped at the foot of its biggest fantasy icon, Walt Disney World (oops  sorry; can't say the 'D-word').This sardonic streak of dramatic irony gives the film teeth, and a rough-and-tumble authenticity that helps it stand out amidst more saccharine or pedantic 'social issues' indie film contemporaries. Instead, Baker's film, conventional subject matter notwithstanding, is as mischievously playful as it is devastating, and achingly sincere in its gaudiness, packing enough of a punch to ensure (gasp!) a shelf-life beyond the inevitable awards circuit. The dreamy, lackadaisical editing, popping colours, and cheerfully jittery cinematography may conjure an ambiance of the lazy, carefree days of a perennial summer, but Baker is adamant to differentiate his film from an archetypal indie account of cute, quirky kids learning life lessons from adversity. For one, protagonist Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) and her cronies are purposefully a lot crueler and more manic than the typical indie childhood cherub, and their harder-edged hijinks romping around their welfare motel (playing with fire, circuit breakers, and some particularly gross vandalism) take some acclimatizing to, with a fair helping of sharing in the condescending wincing of the fellow adults on screen. It's acting out in every sense of the word, as the children's 'play' reaches Tasmanian devil levels of wanton disturbance, partially due to a lack of proper supervision (poignantly, many of their un- or under-employed parents are scarcely more than teenagers themselves), and partially an existential cry of destructive defiance in the face of a world with frighteningly little to offer them past the protective cushion of youth. Their antics, and the shambling, largely improvised banter accompanying them, are at once cacophonous, hugely funny, deeply sad, and often without immediate narrative point  in short, the quintessence of childhood. Still, it's this aimless exuberance of youth that Baker acutely taps into. His film floats with a freeform breeziness, even as the perennial threat of real world consequences looms like an ominous haze of firework smoke over the silhouette of the elusive Cinderella castle. Here, potential catastrophes like a house fire and visit from a (hastily evicted) pedophile become an afternoon's entertainment, while the perennial threat of eviction, arrest, and social services are transmuted into a giddy game of heists and cons (while Moonee's comically recurring baths serve as a sordid punchline, and a terribly clever flourish of Baker forcing the audience to share in blissful childhood ignorance). The feverishly Sisyphean editing conveys the sticky, sweaty ambiance of the motel and the dispiriting claustrophobia of having no escape from it with unsettling authenticity. Still, Baker finds a perverse, surreal beauty in the phantasmagorical gaudiness of the Disney-knockoff souvenir shops flanking the motel (one tracking shot shot of the kids running down the strip is a beautiful albeit horrifying kaleidoscope of tacky excess). And if his shambling pacing proves somewhat too indulgently free-form and a touch too sleepy at times, particularly in a less focused first act, it settles into an entrancing haze that allows the noxious weight of artificiality and poor circumstances and choices to practically sink into the audience's pores. And that ending  a flight of fantastic fantasy all the more infectiously soaring in its incongruity and cathartic, anarchically unauthorized ballsiness  just may stand the test of time to be one of the most jubilantly hopeless finales in recent cinematic history. Baker's cast of non-actors bring a ragged authenticity to their performances so compelling that it adequately compensates for their occasional rougher patches when the dialogue leans more on script than the flexibility of improvisation. This year's Jacob Tremblay-calibre discovery, Prince is exceptional beyond her years, brimming with fiery, combative charisma and snappy 'take-no-sh*t' repartee, and Baker is content to her her play, and celebrate the sheer mischievous joie-de-vivre she stirs up. She's so disarmingly fun that you practically ache to protect her from the encroaching horrors of reality she whimsically skips between, and to let her just be a child. Similarly, former Instagram model Bria Vinaite is remarkably powerful as Moonee's hazy mother. Vinaite flaunts acerbic airs of belligerent trashiness, acting out as destructively and alarmingly as her daughter (including a hilariously disgusting gag with a sanitary pad), only to allow them to crumple inwardly with beats of genuine jubilance and fleeting self-loathing that are masterfully affecting. Finally, Willem Dafoe is as affecting as he is subtle as the softly parental guardian angel trying to hold together a building full of broken people, and watching hints of silent pride or cavernous disappointment colour his face is impressively moving. His standoff with a flock of cantankerous herons also stands out as one of the year's heartiest laughs. Whiffs of the devastating innocence of Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves and a sweet- but-sour helping of dramatic irony lend Baker's film legs beyond indie Oscar bait du-jour, into something consummately more moving and memorable. So, next trip to the magic kingdom (or to one of its multi-million dollar cinematic releases flanking Baker's), spare a thought for The Florida Project, and its real-life denizens. It's a small world, after all. -8/10"
104,The Florida Project,9,13 November 2017,The sadness that heals,"""The Florida Project"" is funny, poignant, and ultimately sad. Astonishing Brooklynn Prince is 6 year-old Moonee, who lives with her Mom Halley, amazing newcomer Bria Vinaite, in the rundown Magic Kingdom motel near Disney World. Moonee is the innocent free spirit playing with her friends Scooty and Jancey, played by good Christopher Rivera and Valeria Cotto. Halley is the singularly unfit mother, who peddles wholesale perfume to hotel guests, and casual prostitute to make rent. Willem Dafoe is the generous motel manager constantly giving Halley a break. Dafoe is at his most humane and vulnerable. His performance grounds ""The Florida Project"".As the child Moonee is both unaware and accustomed to her circumstance in Writer and Director Sean Baker's cautionary narrative. After Halley's unforgivable cruelty, she and Moonee joyously play in the rain. This is beautiful and resoundingly sad. In Baker and Chris Bergoch's story, character is destiny. Moonee survives with free breakfasts from Ashley, kind Mela Mupher, and begging for ice cream money. Life is the inherent paradox. Baker brilliantly exposes the ugly and joyous in Moonee's innocence. There is subtle heartbreak as Moonee plays with her toys in the bathtub while Halley has sex for money. The authentic sadness in ""The Florida Project"" is not the healing sadness, rather the reminder of what had likely gone before in younger Halley. Director Baker's power lies in this self-consciousness. It's one thing that drunken fiery Halley does her very best, but she is no Mother. That missing costs Moonee her very being. Prince amazes as little Moonee. Her Moonee loves her Mom with all her heart, perhaps choosing to turn a blind eye. We eventually glimpse through Baker's lens that Moonee deep down knows something is just not right. Prince is touching in her shining resilience and her keen awareness. She tells Scooty, ""I can tell when grownups are going to cry."" But when does Moonee get to cry? Prince and Vinaite have authentic screen chemistry. We pull for Moonee and Halley out their love for each other, but that is not enough to save the day. Dafoe's Bobby is well aware. He really can't know what's going on inside Moonee and Halley, all he can do is have compassion. The world at times can seem unfair, and love alone may not save the day. Yet, Baker says even in this, perhaps something greater is possible. Maybe the sadness does heal in the end."
105,The Florida Project,9,11 November 2017,"One of the year's best movies, period","""The Florida Project"" (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of 6 yr. old Moonee and her young mother Hallee (in her early 20s or so), living in a trashy motel and barely getting by financially. As the movie opens, Moonee and a couple of her friends, all on summer break, are mulling about the large motel complex ""Magic Kingdom Inn"", not far from the real Magic Kingdom. It's not long before the young kids case (minor) trouble, bringing out Bobby, the motel's manager. Meanwhile Hallee needs to come up with money to pay the weekly rent. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from up-and-coming director Sean Baker, who previously gave us the equally excellent ""Tangerine"" a couple of years ago. Here he takes a look at a neglected underbelly of American society: the barely scraping by folks who literally live week-to-week, or even day-to-day, to the (almost) complete ignorance of their young children, who in turn live their daily lives as any young children would, rich or poor. The movie is blessed with a thorough humanitarian touch from Baker. William Dafoe (as Bobby the manager) is the sole ""big name"" attached to this movie, and he is wonderful. But the true star of this movie is young Brooklynn Prince, who is nothing short of sensational. Bottom line: this movie brings a real slice of life as seldom seen. No, there aren't any ""action scenes"", but instead we get to know ""real"" characters, living their life as best as they can. Simply outstanding.""The Florida Project"" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim. The movie finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but two screens, a rarity. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was not attended very well (about 10 people), I'm sorry to report. Regardless, I see a lot of movie, and this one is easily one of the very best I've seen this year, and I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray and draw your own conclusion. ""The Florida Project"" is a WINNER."
106,The Florida Project,9,9 November 2017,Sean Baker is the Maxim Gorky of Our Time,"Much like the feral children of the Magic Castle  the tacky, rundown Orlando motel where we lay our scene not the Disney Cinderella castle - my early childhood was one of constant flux. Part of that was built into the whimsy of being a kid. A new neighbor would become your best friend with a simple invitation to play outside then become a perfect stranger by the week's end. But to me there was also the added complication of living the semi-nomadic lifestyle. Every few years my parents would move and after a day or two of travel I'd be ricocheting off the walls of a brand new place, ready and willing to meet my new potential besties.It was on that level that I deeply felt for and connected with Moonee (Prince), the troublemaking Floridian youngster that breathes life into the neons, pastels and verdant greens of The Florida Project. She, along with her friends Jancey (Cotto), Scooty (Rivera) and Dicky (Malik) playfully terrorize the denizens of Orlando's crusty motel rooms and gravelly parking lots to stave off the boredom and the heat. Courting mischief at every turn, the rag-tag group of friends runs wild; finding excitement in everything from pasture fields to abandoned housing projects to the greens just outside the Disney World theme park where on a clear night, you can see the nightly fireworks.Yet as the children have their delirious fun, the complex, dangerous and cruel world of adulthood lays always at the periphery, threatening their unending summertime fun. Moonee's mom Halley (Vinaite), hardly more mature than her six-year-old, takes the brunt of every consequence of systemic, individual and moral poverty. The lack of education, lack of mobility, lack of future prospects braces uneasily against Halley's worse instincts. She keeps the authorities at bay with flagrantly desperate hustles yet without really trying, she only makes her situation and thus Moonnee's situation much worse.The Florida Project was once the name of Walt Disney's top secret land development initiative that would eventually become Disney World, Orlando. One can't help but feel the title is a slight on the part of director Sean Baker whose previous films have found beauty in unexpected places. And here there is a lot of beauty but there's also a lot of ugliness in what many would call the closest thing to paradise on earth. Gross neglect and heartrending degradation takes place just outside the manufactured fun and fairy-tale street signs of the infamous park. Those in need of vacation come and go as they please, with little knowledge of their complicity in what is captured for the screen.Yet despite all this, what makes The Florida Project truly special is its light touch. It stops short of judging its characters - or worse still moralizing what could have amounted to poverty porn and giving its characters socio-political halos to wear. Much like Bobby (Dafoe), the unappreciated manager of the Magic Castle, we observe them through lenses of world-weary empathy. A beaten down but still ticking humanism that has learned to accept some things as they are yet still on a happy search of that innate goodness from within. A quiet grace, a foul-mouthed optimism, the remnants of arrested development grinded down by the realities of life; in short we see in this movie, real, actual people.All in all, The Florida Project is incontrovertible proof that Sean Baker is the Maxim Gorky of our time - an exemplary writer and gifted visual director with an eye and soul for great human dramas. Additionally the movie provides an unforgettable showcase for debut actresses Brooklynn Prince and Bria Vinaite and a career highlight for the indelible Willem Dafoe who stops just short of being a thankless bargain bin Gabriel and somehow pulls it off gracefully. Finally, while some may perish the thought of watching a movie like this in general and may not be as receptive to the overall message as myself, the accuracy with which The Florida Project portrays the innocence of childhood is powerful enough for everyone to watch at least once."
107,The Florida Project,9,9 November 2017,"""I can always tell when adults are about to cry""","Six year old Moonee proclaims when seeing frustrated tourists realize they are booked in a decadent motel just outside of Disney World. Not that this scene is monumental in moving the plot, but that instance of perception by the child is indicative of her wisdom, well beyond her years.The Florida Project follows the intertwining lives of Moonee, her unbalanced mother, Halley, played by Bria Vinaite, and Willem Dafoe's character, Bobby Hicks, the manager of an extended-living motel. Shot in 35mm film, director, Sean Baker, puts strong emphasis on the human condition of these ultimately deprived individuals. Moonee and her pals find entertainment in petty trouble making, spitting on cars, tricking passerby into buying them ice cream, to serious a more serious offense in arson. The unfortunate circumstance stems from her mother involving her in the multiple means of solicitation to keep up with rent, put food on the table, and enjoy life's simple pleasures.Bobby Hicks, though constantly frustrated with the behavior of both Moonee and Halley, takes on a father-like role, a situation he is reluctant to be in, but serves as redemption, as it is briefly alluded to that his relationship is strained with his own son. His passion is evident in many instances trying to protect the girls. Overall, the acting is superb on all fronts, creating a very real look into this hole of despair outside of the ""happiest place on earth."" Brooklynn Prince's portrayal of Moonee highlights the juxtaposition of skewed sense of innocence and alternative maturity that emanates from her upbringing and surroundings. The culmination of this, which I won't spoil, captures the spirit of Moonee and the collocation of the world she lives in."
108,The Florida Project,8,8 November 2017,Roofs Require More Than Money,"A motel cul-de-sac has swallowed stacked rows of squatters. The pastel exteriors and novelty signs paint a twinkling sheen that covers welfare moans. Reservations are made in carefully segmented intervals, and the guests are never described as permanent. A purgatory for those with child ankle weights.Bobby is the benevolent duke of the castle, a man residing beside his subjects, more of a servant than a ruler. His neck is always exposed, and his gracious disposition steamrolls his body into a doormat. Bobby's highest loyalty is to the children, unschooled, unchaperoned, and undisciplined. The little Moonee is the three-foot terror that attempts to usurp the throne with prohibited ice cream and science experiments. She has recruited a rag tag team of mini hustlers. Stealing cues from her mother, Halley, she works the streets in significantly more innocent ways, yet retains the same sinister motive.Stuck protecting doomed fragments of families, Bobby builds a secret charity under the nose of regional management. An alternative lodging option for families not fortunate enough to stay within the Kingdom, his operation melds Floridian and out-of-state sensibilities in often vicious ways.Scams and unsanctioned transactions of service comprise the income of drowning mothers. Abandon crack houses and hurricane remnants provide jungle gym sanctuaries for foulmouthed but imaginative rug rats. The safaris and mystery hunts culminate in vibrant childhoods undervalued by the state.A war of financial attrition rages as Moonee becomes a giant prune in a bathtub play prison. Bobby trusts Halley at an unreasonable level, but he is trying to rewrite a history that has pushed his last ""Halley"" beyond communication. Parenthood becomes rather arbitrary when predators are loose. A motel manager can even be a father in a pinch, but the kids are bound for a custody cyclone."
109,The Florida Project,10,30 October 2017,Six-year-old truants enjoy last liberty,"The title ""Florida Project"" refers to (i) the projects type of crammed, seedy community these working and unemployed denizens are crammed into, and (ii) writer/director Sean Baker's undertaking to record the life children and their single moms live in the American underbelly. This Florida digs beyond the fantasy of Disneyworld to the seediness of the cheap old motel where the transient can afford to take temporary root. This is the world that the liberals disdain, Hillary's ""deplorables,"" the people who see no other hope than voting for Trump. In an early scene a honeymooning couple find they've booked into the cheap motel Magic Castle, not the Disney luxurious fantasy. At the end little Moonee and Jansey run toward that Disney dreamworld, in futile attempt to escape their unaccommodating reality.Tom Sawyer meets Thelma and Louise. The bulk of the film is the amazing spectacle of Moonee and her friends bouncing through a life of simple adventures. Fueled on sugar the kids are constantly running, dancing, jumping, doing everything especially the forbidden. ""We're not supposed to go into that room. Let's go in anyway."" The blackout they cause the whole motel brightens their day, their unharnessed mustang spirit. When they burn down the vacated condo complex the blaze excites the kids and adults alike. But it forces a rift between the two kids' mothers, Moonee's Halley and the girlfriend who has been giving them free food from her diner. The motel women provide a spectrum of responsibility. At one end is the African American grandmother raising her daughter's child. She knows discipline should not be fun. Then there's Scooty's hard-working waitress mom who is close and generous towards Halley until she feels her son endangered by Halley's example. At the other, Halley is more immature than her six-year-old daughter. To earn money Halley lives on the fly, hawking cheap perfume, feeding off friends and fraud, finally turning to prostitution, which loses first her best friend then Moonee. Apparently Moonee has not been going to school. She has to be told what ""recess"" is, because her life has been one long recess. So has Halley's, which makes her eventual loss of her daughter inevitable. Tragic, but inevitable. The film's themes and emotions are propelled by the children's amazing performances, especially Brooklynn Prince as Moonee. In the concluding wallop Moonee runs to Jansey not to seek refuge from the social agency  which we first expect  but to say goodbye. She knows she has lost her freedom, her mother, her particular childhood. When the once goodie-goodie Jansey takes her hand and runs away with her, the kids make one last grab at the life they want to live. Like their mothers, they'll have to lapse into the life to which their social and economic status restricts them. In the opening shot, the motel wall provides an abstract composition of pink and grey. The two squirming kids seated in front of it inject life into that abstraction, as the characters do to terms like ""the projects"" or ""the deplorables."" Indeed the range of settings frustrates any attempt at generalization. The motel embodies the life Florida tourists ignore. The commercial landscapes are a surreal eruption of crazy buildings and garishness. Against those two forms of denaturedness, two scenes find Moonee freeing her imagination in escapes to nature. In one she sits in what she declares her ""favourite tree"": it fell over but still carries on. That prefigures her own conclusion. Then she takes Jansey on ""safari""  to a field of cows. The games and adventures Moonee keeps inventing are her spontaneous attempt to imagine a richer life than her situation provides. It's a livelier alternative to her mother's armour of tattoos. Presiding over this world is motel manager Bobby. Willem Dafoe is more familiar as an edgy, crazy character, which lends weight to the moral and character centre he plays here. His responsibility continually pitches him against Moonie's mischief and Halley's truancy. But he cares for them both. He achieves a modest heroism when he spots and assails a child molester, then when he drives off Halley's threatening john. But when the social agency and police get involved, Bobby can only stand aside, sympathetic but helpless. Bobby tries to keep up the motel's image. He repaints the walls and plans to fix the washers. He tries to enforce the laws. The owner instructs Bobby to have the tenants move their bikes off the front balcony. Clearly he wants to upscale the place  like the other motel Bobby tries to get Halley into. The wheels of the economy grind on. Soon even this Magic Castle will go upscale, casting out its desperate tenants and challenging them even more. These are the characters America has left behind."
110,The Florida Project,7,30 October 2017,Compelling film about innocence and poverty,"Sean Baker's film about a small group of children who live in a seedy hotel with their impoverished single young mothers near Disneyland doesn't always live up to the hype. It's a solid, but curiously flawed work. It has opening credits that feel like closing credits and the editing is awkward almost from the start. The pacing of the film is not its strong suit; it can seem lackadaisical and sometimes downright aimless, although admittedly that barren backdrop might be in keeping with a film that depicts children growing up with little or no structure. At occasional moments, one might wonder where the film is even going.With all of this being said, however, the film does go on to finish strong. We find out that these are not well-behaved kids early on and their near absolute freedom is derived from the young women who raise them and who have a ways to go in terms of adult responsibility themselves. There is a frequent sense of angst for the children's safety as they reap the benefits of minimal adult supervision and haphazard discipline. Baker's film is about growing up on the fringes of society where fathers have virtually no presence.Performances here are nothing but exceptional. Willem Dafoe is excellent here as the kind but hardened hotel manager who has to balance his sympathy for one of the mothers with his steadfast refusal to tolerate criminal behavior in his establishment. He looks out for the children vigilantly even as they test his patience. Newcomer Bria Vinaite makes an impression as a troubled young woman who will do anything, including engage in prostitution, to provide for her daughter. Although the film ends on a very uncertain note, it is in keeping with a compelling portrait of innocence toddling through a squalid adult world of poverty, crime and despair. Almost anyone one who watches this attentively will compare it to his or her own childhood, no matter how dissimilar. Recommended."
111,The Florida Project,7,24 October 2017,American Honey 2.0,"Willem Dafoe plays a housing complex manager who is trying to maintain order while out of control kids run wild and their parents run wilder. This film is beautifully shot around the Florida area with many backdrops using the local stores which have oversized and frankly bizarre looking designs which incorporate vivid colours and huge cartoon like figures mixed with neon lights which makes the town look like a brought to life cartoon landscape. This has the effect of making the children look like they are in a wonderland and at the same time making the adults who are themselves trapped into childlike behaviour patterns seem unable to break into adulthood proper. There is a strong sense of community within the housing complex however the fragility of some friendships when adults are acting like out of control teens is no surprise. This movie focuses on poor white America, struggling to make ends meet and parents who think nothing of playing explicit rap music on their phones while they bathe their young kids. The effect of this style of parenting is plain to see in how the kids antagonise the adults around them.While we are in no doubt that the main female protagonist loves her daughter who is obviously loving the freedom afforded to her by her mother,but just how long can the kids be allowed to run wild without consequences? I'd say that if you enjoyed American Honey this film is for you. At just under two hours it certainly seems much shorter. Recommended."
