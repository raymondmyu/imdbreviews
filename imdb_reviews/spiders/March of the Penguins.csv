0,March of the Penguins,10,13 June 2005,Amazing,"I recently saw this film at the Waterfront Film Festival in Michigan and I can say it's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.Narrated by Morgan Freeman, it follows the annual journey that penguins and their mates endure to bring a newborn penguin into the world. This film has some of the most amazing footage I've ever see in a documentary ... including underwater footage beneath the ice of penguins feeding and being fed on. Footage so amazing that I heard one viewer saying how it must have been CGI as he left the venue.If you have any interest in nature, penguins, or just want to see a touching story of the amazing journey that penguins make simply to perpetuate their breed, definitely check this film out in theatres. It's a masterpiece."
1,March of the Penguins,8,29 June 2005,The Emperor's  mating waltz in Antarctica,"""The March of the Penguins"" has to be one of the most beautiful documentaries in recent memory. Luc Jacquet, its director, takes us on trip to Antarctica where we are introduced to the majestic Emperor penguins. Mr. Jacquet and his cinematographers, Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison, have done the impossible task to capture these penguins in their own habitat under conditions that seem almost humanly impossible to live, let alone take this team to register it for us, the viewers in all its splendor and bleakness.The Emperor penguins have to be the most elegant birds on this planet. They have such a noble way of standing and shuffling in almost perfect lines from the sea to the area where they will mate, hatch their eggs, and then have the females leave for the sea to feed themselves and bring back food for the new chicks. After that is accomplished, it's the males turn to do their march back to the sea to feed and fortify themselves, returning to the hatching and mating area. What makes these penguins so unique is the sense of family they project at all times. Mr. Jacquet makes it clear for us to understand the behavior of the Emperors in their hostile environment. The English version has the clear narration by Morgan Freeman who expands on the way these birds live and how they are able to survive under extreme conditions. From what I have read about the documentary, the English version, which we are seeing in this country, has a musical score by Alex Wurman, that enhances the movie in unexpected ways.Antarctica, that icy white vastness at the end of the world, has never looked more majestic than in this documentary. Thanks to Luc Jacquet we are enlightened by all what we learn about the Emperors as they endure and survive under the worst possible circumstances and remain the graceful figures they are. Watching ""The March of the Penguins"" feels, at times, like being at the ballet watching a magical dance performed by these flightless birds that manage to look so dignified all the time while doing for us their amazing dance of survival."
2,March of the Penguins,9,8 July 2005,Luc Jacquet has done the impossible.,"Toss that anthropomorphic expectation and embrace your inner animal because documentarian Luc Jacquet has done the impossible: March of the Penguins respects, even adores, these indomitable cuties, not because, as Morgan Freeman says in his voice-over narration, they may be just like us, but rather because they are not like us. Although we may want to see ourselves in them, we end up seeing in this incomparably intimate journey through the entire breeding cycle in Antarctica is a unique organism totally devoted to the survival of its family, brooking no selfish activity and no vacation from the harsh climate and relentless demands of nature.This film's strength is a lack of sentimentality that allows us to focus on the strategies of survival: Thousands of penguins closely huddle with their backs to the sometimes 100 mile an hour winds; fathers and mothers equally share responsibilities such as trudging 70 miles each way to store up food for the babies; fathers protect eggs while mothers make that journey; mates separate after the season from each other and their babies forever. Their lovemaking is dignified and the essence of minimalism. These are just a few of the rituals that characterize an evolutionary process guaranteeing the survival of the species.Jacquet occasionally courts repetition, anathema to a hyperactive audience, but if the audience gives itself over to the rhythms of penguins breeding to live, it will not be bored. Winged Migration seems strangely detached by comparison, formations mostly seen from afar. Jacquet gets up close and personal (The parents exchanging an egg to be stored under their coats is memorable) to make the audience collaborator rather than voyeur. Lamentably, the director includes no scenes of raw predator activity, just a large scavenger scooping up a baby. A documentary should allow the audience of experiencing the good and the bad.A few years ago I hid in a trench in New Zealand to see Penguins rise out of the sea at the same time each day marching by us to their camps. I was deeply moved by their dignity and calm, punctuated with a resolve to keep their rituals intact for millennia. That unflagging constancy is devoutly to be wished in humanity.For once, the trailer hype may be accurate: ""In the harshest place on earth, love finds a way."" Love of species would be more accurate. No matter, you'll love the film."
3,March of the Penguins,8,14 June 2005,"Amazing, beautiful looking film","I was lucky enough to see this film at the Waterfront Film Festival in Saugatuck, Michigan. This was a wonderful documentary directed by Luc Jacquet which follows penguins traveling to their breeding ground in Antarctica.Narrated by Morgan Freeman, it's beautiful and I loved the way it didn't just point a camera at penguins and say how they live, this one actually told a story. If it wasn't narrated, you would still be able to follow the basic idea of the film. The countless penguins travel a very long distance to breed. It's very interesting to watch these penguins, they go through so many ordeals just to have kids.It's in the style of Winged Migration, the scenery is a character. If you get the chance to see this film I recommend it, it's wonderful to look at and it's impossible not to love the penguins."
4,March of the Penguins,10,15 June 2005,A Story of Survival,"The March of the Penguins is a powerful film. It is sad, funny, and simply amazing at the same time. It teaches us that life is a miracle. For the emperor penguins life is an everyday struggle to survive against predators, storms, and raging winds in the harshest weather conditions on earth. The documentary, filmed on location in Antarctica, shows the birds' struggle to eat, live, and reproduce. Each year the birds walk over seventy miles across ice and snow to their breeding ground. There the penguins mate, then conceal their eggs from the cold under a fold of their skin and balancing the precious new life to be born on their claws. Fathers take turns in caring for the eggs until they hatch, while mothers walk long miles again to bring home food for the chicks. Once the chicks are born, the parents work together to feed, shelter, and raise them. French director Luc Jacquet was a scientist before he became a filmmaker. He succeeded in making the story dramatic, compelling, and comprehensible to younger viewers. The film is skillfully narrated by Morgan Freeman. It is a definite MUST SEE."
5,March of the Penguins,8,17 July 2005,Beautiful film-making. A real crowd pleaser.,"If you make the effort to catch March of the Penguins, you'll be predictably pleased for the simple fact that if it's penguins you want to see it's penguins you're going to get. Beaucoups de penguins. And you will learn plenty about these noble survivors of the coldest place on earth. If it's Danny DeVito or Burgess Meredith you came to see, you are quite off the mark. The Emperor Penguins of Antarctica survive and perpetuate their species in a frozen and surreal environment driven by instincts developed over centuries. They have mostly monogamous relationships and in the midst of this can recognize one another's 'voices'. These relationships help to organize survival. We get seemingly impossible and privileged views of their long marches across barren landscapes, complex rituals of protecting of fragile eggs in 160 mph winds, huddled in huge packs against the cold, males and females sharing food foraging duties, and chubby birds diving to great depths for fish. It's a remarkable system of survival. The French filmmakers shot on super 16mm film for one year (with 120 hours of images), which is a whole winter cycle for the emperor. They saw none of the images as they progressed. Nobody left until it was done and director as LUC JACQUET SAYS; ""It took a year to recover. Re-entry is a long process."" The result is, no doubt, some the most remarkable footage ever filmed on the subject. What they do, of course, to reel in their audience is to anthropomorphize these creatures. Like the recent ""Parrots of Telegraph Hill"" we see the penguins take on the attributes of 'love' and 'caring'. The baby penguins toddle along just like little people, except that they do so braving extreme minus degree temperatures. Miles of these cute birds march across landscapes like little wind up toys in a John Ford snow desert. The story is assisted by cloying music and narration, and the dulcet tones of the ubiquitous Morgan Freeman. But any criticism of the manipulative aspects of the film would be irrelevant in the face of the achievement. These are stunning images beautifully assembled to serve a remarkable story. If your going to get the paying public into a nature flick, this is the way to do it."
6,March of the Penguins,9,28 June 2005,Marvelous!,"If this comes to your town, do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen. I never realized how difficult life is for these amazing creatures. The fact that they continue to exist at all is something of a miracle. The movie doesn't anthropomorphize the penguins and yet there are times when the audience I attended with identified with them almost on a human level. The audience I saw it with giggled and said ""Awww"" many times with varying degrees of audibility. There are even some times when the audience fell dead silent in quiet reflection such as when, for one or two penguins, the long march was in vain.Also, bring the family to this one! I saw it with my mother, sister, and grandfather and we all came out talking about our favorite parts and how amazing penguins are. My mom said she liked Winged Migration more, but I actually liked this one more.P.S. I noticed in the credits that there were digital effects artists who worked on March of the Penguins. I'm not sure what digital effects were done. If anyone has any information on this, please send me a private message."
7,March of the Penguins,10,12 July 2005,Remarkable,"This is perhaps the most amazing animal documentary ever. The footage was gathered in what truly must be ""the harshest place on earth"". It is barren, cold beyond cold and then there is the endless night of winter. The underwater footage was my favorite, but every single frame is magnificent. I can't wait for the DVD, so I can see how the filmmakers did this.The narration is less objective than it is romantic - making it less a true documentary than a story, but that is fine in this case, and Morgan Freeman does a great job. You really should make the effort to see this on the big screen - it is absolutely stunning!"
8,March of the Penguins,,28 November 2005,The real man behind March of the Penguins,"Despite Luc Jaquet 's brilliant idea of making a documentary on the penguins, people should know that only LAURENT CHALET Director of Photography and assistant JEROME MAISON spent one year shooting the film completely alone and almost died there.Luc Jaquet, quoted as the Director, was in fact never behind the camera. Laurent CHALET shot almost 100% of the entire film while Luc Jaquet stayed in France, waiting one year for the return of CHALET and MAISON to start editing the footage that he discovered at the same time.Laurent CHALET, is the real man behind the Penguins."
9,March of the Penguins,7,9 July 2007,Cute and visually spectacular,"La Marche de l'Empereur (2005) is a french documentary that features the habits of penguins during the course of one year: their mating rituals, their migrations, laying of the eggs, searching for food, etc. It also shows them facing a danger or two, and (what for me was the highlight of the movie) the moment when the baby penguins break out of their shells! The movie is visually astounding. The cinematographer has managed to capture extreme close-ups where you can see the pattern of their feathers, as well as breath-taking longshots of hundreds of penguins marching on the beautiful icy backdrop. There is also a suspenseful underwater sequence.The movie is accompanied with poetic voice-overs that tell the story from the penguins' point of view, and gentle ambiance music. There are also a few laughs here and there, as penguins bump into each other or slip on the ice.The movie could have been handled better from a dramatic storytelling stand-point, but it seemed the director was aiming to create a sort of poetic new age nature movie, and as such, it works perfectly. Admittedly, there are points where the style starts to wear on you, and some parts seem to be repeating themselves, but at 80 minutes long the movie doesn't overstay its welcome.All in all, the movie is a memorable experience, and manages to be informative and entertaining at the same time, and even manages to be moving on occasion. And penguins are simply the cutest animals!"
10,March of the Penguins,9,10 July 2005,A story of a reality. A story where happy ending isn't found. Just lots and lots of amazing feats in between.,"This movie can be read as too achingly cute, too pushily touching and too mundanely poignant, but hey, those birds damn well deserve them. They walk (more like waddle) for hundreds of miles in total, starve themselves for months, and oh yeah, have to endure extreme subzero temperature and a few more with 100-mile-speed wind, all that with unbelievable grace, not too mention poise (that's why they wear tuxes) and all that for the sake of procreation.The movie starts with stunning helicopter shots of antarctic glaciers (some the shots are worthy of an exhibition at a Chelsea gallery) and in the sun-lurked distance 'tis seen dark figures strutting across the white ice, and lo they are emperor penguins shooting from an ice-hole, from that on we are taken for a journey of endurance and survival, with moments of humor and joy here and there, but one thing this movie doesn't lack is elegance.Just like a tradition of complex animal behavior, this one is bound to be inspiring for us humans and so much so, I was kind of embarrassed for our species because of their superior adaptation and continued existence. I was moved when the penguin march leader decided that he was no longer apt to be a leader, he just stopped and another penguin replace his position. It was unnervingly stirring when the group huddle during a freak snow storm, that and more.The movie is restrained right before it starts to develop tyrptophan (unlike the turkeys in ""winged migration"") and for some scenes, to protect the G rating. But this sublime retreat from logical narrative of men offer even more enlightened and transcendent view that life, no matter how harsh the situation might be, is never just about humdrum struggle for survival or just to fulfill purpose, but for these penguins, a passionate, selfless caring, reliant, and an understanding struggle. Even knowing that they're going to face the same cruel fate over and over and over again. The kingdom of these emperors will be standing for some time, I bet."
11,March of the Penguins,8,26 August 2005,What a delightful film,"I was going to let this movie pass me by, but friends told me how nice this little film was. So I decided to go see it and I am certainly glad that I did. This is a delightful movie that tracks a year in the life of a flock of penguins. I never realized the harsh conditions that these brave birds have to go through to breed and exist. The cinematography is wonderful making you part of this brave march for existence. In this day of so much junk being called movies, it is refreshing to see a well made documentary that will inform you. My hat is off to the crew that made this outstanding movie. Go see it, you certainly will enjoy it."
12,March of the Penguins,8,18 September 2005,excellent but flawed,"March of the Penguins features stunning photography. The scenery is bleak and gorgeous, and the penguins are a marvel to watch. It was obviously done under dangerous and very difficult conditions. It gently teaches the basics of the mating cycle of the Emperor penguin. For these alone, it's well worth watching -- in fact, it's well worth paying to see it in a theater, since you won't get nearly as good a picture on DVD.But.The penguins are jarringly anthropomorphized in places. (And this is the American version. Talking penguins would have kicked my rating down two or three points.) The director is particularly enamored of the penguins' head-bent-down pose. This appears to be because it looks so touching when interpreted in human terms. But there's no reason to believe that it has the same meaning as the same pose in a human, and so it contributes to the anthropomorphism.The music, while pleasant and mostly unobtrusive, is still jarringly romantic, and it's totally unnecessary. Why couldn't we have just heard the birds and the wind? That would have done wonders to set the stage in all its bleak beauty. As it was, I found it hard to get involved, and the music was part of what got in the way.A few people have objected to the natural violence shown. But in fact, the problem for me was that the violence of nature was passed over so lightly. One egg freezes early, another egg freezes late, one or two chicks die, one mama gets offed by a seal and one chick taken by a petrel, all very gently. The penguins marching across the ice appeared stoic (more anthropomorphism) but we get little sense of the difficulty of the trek. And the storms, described accurately as ferocious and deadly, look on camera like a moderate March day in Iowa. Despite the setting, nature is seriously prettified here.Although the basics of the mating cycle are clearly laid out, I left wishing the movie had told a lot more of the story. They had time. They could have mentioned the explorers who discovered the mating site (fascinating story from the little I know), survival rates (they give numbers for the weight loss -- is the mortality rate too frightening?), why the bird lays so large an egg, dynamics of the ice ridges, aspects of penguin anatomy which enable them to survive the cold and the long fast, how can the penguins slide on their bellies so much without losing their insulation. Could have included a lot more. All in all, some of my favorite part was the credits, where they show a little of the equipment and the setup and the people making the film, and how the penguins interacted with the filmmakers.Finally several things didn't fit. They said that the penguins mated over thick ice because it was less likely to melt through before they left, but some shots of the location showed rock outcrops, implying land, and so were actually shot elsewhere. They show the females sloshing through a meltwater creek in late winter, when there would be no melting. The narration gets to September and talks about ""several months"" of back-and-forth treks for feeding, and then suddenly it's only November. The parents leave the chicks on shore ""never to see them again"", and then the chicks stand around for a month with nothing to eat but gaining weight and strength -- huh? I don't mind that they used some footage out of place for dramatic effect, but they didn't always keep it consistent with the dramatized locale.I like MotP and recommend it, but with these reservations. It's a good film that could have been a great film.Edward"
13,March of the Penguins,8,27 July 2005,A Beautiful Film.......,"It is becoming increasingly rare to find nature documentaries shown on the big screens of corporate-owned American theaters. And judging by the scant few people in attendance at a Saturday night showing of THE MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, I can see why. With the draw of so many garish productions offering the viewer an escape from the real world, films that actually do show the complexities and beauty of that world are marginalized. It would seem to me that the decision to release a US version of the french film LA MARCHE DE L'EMPEREUR (with different narration, performed here by Morgan Freeman, and a new musical score by Alex Wurman) was based on the success of the animated film MADAGASCAR, which features plucky talking penguins. I'm sure that this was not the sole reason, but I would guess it played a part in the minds of the distributors who were looking for a return on their investment. What MARCH OF THE PENGUINS shows, however, is that even without the power of speech, the emperor penguins in this film are intelligent and complex. It should also help reinforce the truism that animals do not have to talk or sing to be interesting.THE MARCH OF THE PENGUINS follows the intricate and grueling migration rituals of emperor penguins as they cross the vast extent of the polar ice sheet to mate. Literally thousands make the miles long trip in a single-file formation. Having completed the voyage, we then see the busy process of choosing a partner and how the fertilized egg is exchanged to the males so that the females can make the return trek to feed. They will not return to the starved male penguins for about four months. In that time the eggs have hatched and the chicks take their first look out at the Arctic landscape. This frigid environment is unforgiving and not all the young penguins survive. The film handles these scenes gently. There is an inherent sadness in the idea that the world is hardest on those that can bear it the least, but it is, and the filmmakers do not sidestep the reality of the situation. The babies that do survive, frolic and prance about as the camera lovingly follows them in their antics. They grow strong, amidst peril, and ultimately return to the ocean to begin the cycle anew. This material will be familiar to avid readers of National Geographic magazine (the motion picture arm of which helped produce this film), or those who watch nature films on a regular basis. Actually, THE MARCH OF THE PENGUINS doesn't really offer any fresh or groundbreaking insight into the study of these animals. It is, however, one of the few films that captures, in such a stunningly picturesque way, the full scope of their journey.In what must have been a harrowing ordeal in itself, the film crew coexists with the penguins in the harshest conditions (with temperatures falling to seventy degrees below zero and exacerbated by viscously high winds). The director, Luc Jacque, who also acts as cinematographer along with Jerome Maison, seems to have a deep respect and fascination for these animals. These feelings come through as his camera lingers on the birds, at times in close-up, capturing only colors and graceful movement. These delicate moments are well accented by Wurman's lovely music. The aerial shots of a huddled black mass of male penguins against the stark white landscape are striking and relay the enormity of the adaptive gathering. One detraction is that the narration often tries too hard to graft the equivalent human emotions onto the actions of the penguins. They may feel emotion, but it is different from the way that we do; there are parallels in the behavior that can be drawn, but Jordan Robert's script (reportedly a vast improvement over the surreal french version), which is mostly informative, does becomes heavy-handed at times. That aside, THE MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is a wonderful alternative to the daily grind of hyperactive theatrical outings which ignore the unique characteristics of the creatures that we share this planet with. 8/10"
14,March of the Penguins,10,6 July 2005,Everything You Could Want from a Movie,"This film is visually stunning, tightly plotted, and emotionally moving. I laughed uncontrollably and cried uncontrollably as the action held mt attention tight all 90 minutes. I identified with and sympathized with the films protagonists. Images and scenes from the movie have stayed with me in the week since I saw it - dipping in and out of my mind repeatedly. This film provides everything you could possibly want from a trip to the cinema.Of course, I am describing a documentary about penguins. The important action linking the above paragraph to a documentary is the film's opening. The first shots show the penguins walking along the horizon. Slightly out of focus, they resemble people - are described as nomads enacting an ancient ritual. In these opening shots, a bond is forged between the audience and the penguins. The penguins - who throughout are portrayed as a sort of single organism in themselves (though there is constant focus on the individuals involved and their personal dramas set against the backdrop of the group as a whole) - are established as human.Soon after this humanizing opening, the film establishes (through visuals, not scientific explanation) that these impressive nomads are emotional beings who, as individuals, form a society. These individual penguins show personality and desire separate from, yet subservient to, those of the group as a whole. Their dilemma - the plot of the movie - is laid out simply - they must reproduce. Their motivations are to survive as a group, to reproduce, to love, and to survive as individuals.The visual simplicity of black and white objects moving against endless expanses of ice, sky, and later water matches the simplicity of the story.These simplicities allow for brilliance of the visual landscape and the basic, endearing, and relevant story to come forward. There are many obstacles for the penguins. Gut-wrenching pain, strife, sacrifice and loss are juxtaposed with inspiring moments of humor, redemption, love, beauty, and accomplishment.The universals of the story allow the viewer to lose himself inside the shot-by-shot movement of the story; to switch from one penguin to another, long-shots to close-ups, desperation to hope; to bask in the beauty of the film and the landscapes and the sheer amazement that this happens on the same Earth as the movie theater, and also to care about how an individual experiences this extremely unlikely adventure of life.This is less a nature documentary than a feature film. Watch it as such. The science is there for the viewer to see and accept. Scientific explanation is not the focus of the narration; it is the backdrop for the stunning look that carries a deep and rewarding story.This all adds up not just a feature film, but to the best feature film of the summer."
15,March of the Penguins,10,29 October 2006,Awesome! Stunning!  Amazing! I Do Not Have Enough Adjectives to Describe My Feelings With This Wonderful Documentary,"The cycle of life the Emperor's penguins is disclosed in this wonderful documentary. Every autumn, these animal leave the safety of the ocean and march along twenty days to a place called ""Oamack"". Once there, they select their mates, they procreate, protect and feed their offspring and after months they return to the sea. Later, their progeny go to the ocean, where they stay for four years, and when they reach their adult life, they follow the same pattern of their parents.I was really impressed with the shoots of this film. How could this team make such awesome footages of this species, following then along months? I was mesmerized with the images and cinematography, and I do not have enough adjectives in English to describe my feelings with this wonderful documentary. I started seeing on DVD alone, then my daughter joined me and I began the movie and at last my wife joined us and we began again the DVD, loving each awesome scene. When I saw a couple of weeks ago ""Die Geschichte Vom Weinenden Kamel"", I thought it would be hard to believe a better candidate to the Oscar of Best Documentary. But now I agree with the choice of the Academy. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Marcha dos Pingüins"" (""The March of the Penguins"")"
16,March of the Penguins,9,2 July 2005,I Just Loved It,"There's really nothing not to like about this movie. It is interesting being shown how the penguins behave and simultaneously told what they are thinking. Obviously the imagery is rather objective but the subjective ""story"" told makes this a movie rather than an Animal Planet TV show. The Story is amazing. Fact is truly stranger than fiction. The characters are well developed; the hero more beautifully photogenic than Brad Pitt and A. Jolie combined; the plot is compelling; and though the ending can never be in doubt its story is both riveting and the resolution impactful. I took my date and my 7 year old and we all loved it."
17,March of the Penguins,7,10 May 2006,Heartwarming/Heartbreaking,"And oh so cute! Emporer Penguins achieve many miracles every year in their quest for reproduction. How exactly they know how to do all this is incredible.First they all leap out of the ocean and begin to march, single file, for over 70 miles, to their preferred breeding ground. They look really cute as they do this.Then, when they are at their breeding ground, they look for a partner. There are loads more boys than girls, so the competition is stiff. But, eventually, they find a partner and the magic happens. Do penguins fall in love? It seems they do and they all have strange rituals of hugging and talking gibberish. I have no doubts that they are actually talking to each other.As winter comes, they all huddle together in a group. Eggs are laid and passed onto the male as the female go off to search for food. Some eggs are misplaced and the unhatched baby penguin dies. It's really sad.As the girls are away, the boys have to suffer intense blizzards and snow storms. Some of the older ones die, or as Morgan Freeman says, simply go to sleep. A close-up of a penguin closing his eyes for the final time is truly a deeply affecting moment. Since this is the part where it's the males fighting for themselves, this is probably the reason there are less of them.When the girls return, the eggs hatch and adorable little babies poke their heads out and see the world for the first time. But since they are so small, they need to stay sheltered. The males are still sheltering and when the female wants it back they have to move very quickly since the fragile little penguin cannot be out of warmth for more than a few moments.Some die. And a scene where a mother pokes at her dead chick is utterly heartbreaking. However, the majority survives. As they have done for thousands of years. And as summer arrives they grown-ups depart, leaving the babies on their own. And when one of the plucks up enough courage to dive in the ocean, the rest follow. And soon, they'll be back to take part in the same ritual, the same survival quest.It's a purity and innocence that humans have long, long, LONG lost. Every creature on earth exists simply to multiply and be the dominant species. But surely Emperor Penguins do it in the toughest of conditions. Nature may be cruel, but it's pure. You might even end up a little jealous and insist on living as a hermit or wildman in a vain attempt at getting back to nature. But, inevitable, you'll probably miss your playstation and porn too much.Morgan Freeman's narration is brilliant. But since he has the second coolest voice in the world (after Lance Henrikson) I could probably listen to him for hours even if he was just reading the dictionary. The score by Alex Wurman is also great and when coupled with the beautiful cinematography it makes for huge escapism. It reminds me a lot of the Landscape Channel, which I used to watch as a kid.I totally recommend the film. And it's cool that for once a family film can be a documentary and NOT some total crap with Eddie Murphy or Steve Martin selling themselves out."
18,March of the Penguins,8,1 October 2005,Fine Documentary about an Animal Family Doesn't Flinch at Life,"Few animals and fewer people ever venture to the foreboding conditions of Antarctica, but one pair of determined documentary makers made the journey. Director  cinematographer, Laurent Chalet and co-cinematographer Jérôme Maison braved wild winds and far-below-freezing temperatures to film the annual mating ritual of an even heartier group: penguins. The result is a brief, but complete, look into the world of one of the strangest and most determined creatures to have evolved in nature.The trailer gives away anything that might be considered plot. After all, it is a documentary about the very direct need to survive. The story is really in the viewing. It is the visuals of the icy expanse and watching the huge the number of penguins in their parade. Once at their destination, their behavior is moving and intricately social. They provide the amusing antics everyone associates with the flightless birds: they slide around on their bellies and proceed upright in their dignified waddle. However, their survival is maintained as a flock as they huddle for warmth, share food, share responsibilities and police one another's occasionally antisocial tendencies. Director Chalet does not flinch away at the moments when misfortune does strike. There are a couple of villains along the way, but they take their place center stage one at a time. A seal and a seagull come forward to take their meals from the flock. Even one of the group's own attempts a kidnapping. Most of the danger comes from the starkly beautiful landscape. Members, young, old and the unborn, fall to the harsh conditions. There are shots of the lost and the frozen that might bring tears or sadness from a younger movie-goer, but these incidents do not overcome the overall positive themes of love and successful survival. It is odd that birds that act like fish can do so much to remind us of cartoon versions of ourselves. Although that anthropomorphized perspective is overstated in ""March of the Penguins"", it offers a glimpse of a rarely viewed part of world with crisp and beautiful photography and shares a genuine sense of wonder with us. 8 out of 10"
19,March of the Penguins,8,29 August 2005,I thought this was highly enjoyable,"I was fortunate to miss the European version with the extra pop music and dubbed voices.From the American version, it was solely Morgan Freeman's voice on the commentary and some relaxing music in the background.I saw this with my mom, and I think this can be viewed by anyone over 4 (I think anyone who has a kid who's under 4, let's not take them to the a movie theatre, as a whole, we'd rather not want to hear your kid fuss, cry, or get restless and crawl over their chair while we watch a movie), thinking this would be a movie I want to show people who get tired of the constant big-budget wanna-be buddy movie that needs to be based off a 70's/80's television show with local ""hot"" actors with big explosions and constant barrage of mass media to cover swelled movie costs.This is a very subtle, very intelligent film that Freeman's voice is soothing and you get lost in the harsh climate the Emperor Penguins brave in order to continue the species on. I highly recommend this film to those who want something to not just entertain them mindlessly, but give them a better view of the world around them. People fuss and fight over air conditioning while living outside when its 90 degrees Fahrenheit, imagine Penguins trying to just continue their species at 60 degrees below zero in howling winds? I recommend it and invite others to comment and share their opinions."
20,March of the Penguins,8,15 August 2005,"""March Of The Penguins"" is worth the trip.","At a time when documentaries are gaining progressive interest and are seeing wider exposure and release into mainstream multiplexes, it has been an opportune strategy to unveil this latest informative excursion into theaters, where it has surprisingly surpassed even some of the summer's bigger, albeit, stale ambitions which have ended up failing to impress.Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman narrates this natural wonder as seen throughout the frigid exploits of French director, Luc Jacquet.The film chronicles the incredible annual journey of the Emperor penguins as they leave their habitat and travel across endless miles in order to assemble at their designated breeding ground.From there, we see them attempting to locate a mate, and going through the process of ""consummating"" their union.Amazingly, their courtship methods are not so unlike our own, and in many respects, they are reminiscent of humans, often resembling a wealthy society gathering at a formal event.Once the conception has been completed, the penguins must cooperate together in sharing responsibilities and protecting each other from both the unforgiving elements of the endless winter season and from wild predators alike.In awaiting the birth of their offspring, the penguins must overcome starvation, separation, and harsh climactic conditions, and unfortunately, many of them don't survive long enough to greet their young ones into the world.Once the eggs are completely formed and begin to hatch, it becomes a whole new method of survival as the proud and doting parents must oversee the protection and well-being of their newborn chicks.The display of community and family bonds is incredible, as are the expressions of attachment, grief, determination, and altogether sense of instinct.The cinematography is flawless in the way it presents the sprawling, lifeless, white landscape of winter as a background to the black masses of striving and vital creatures. It is a stark contrast between nature's unavoidable tragedies and its welcomed miracles. The accompanying musical score also underlines the atmosphere quite nicely.In our civilization of greed and emphasis on material luxuries, we could really learn a lesson about selflessness, sacrifice and placing priority on more fundamental aspects of living, through this inspirational film."
21,March of the Penguins,8,31 July 2005,The real star is Antarctica,"Incredibly beautiful cinematography, musical score, and narration by Morgan Freeman made this much more than a nature film about almost unbelievable penguin migrations in Antarctica. Yes, the birds were pretty and very admirable for what they accomplished and the chicks were as cute as any babies of any kind anywhere. They got the requisite ooohs and ahhhs from the audience they should have gotten, but the filmmakers did a great job of not overkilling viewers with the cutesy approach that ruins so many other nature films. This was a serious look at one of the more marvelous events in nature that the tattooed and pierced MTV generation knows nothing about, never will, and doesn't care. More's the pity.I liked very much that the French filmmaker tastefully didn't show all the bloody gore of a seal killing an adult and a jaeger killing a chick that lesser nature filmmakers seem to love to do. We got the message loud and clear without all the blood and body parts splashed everywhere. It did not harm the truth of the story at all that graphic scenes were limited.Very classy film all around and anyone with an artistic soul will love the great camera and sound work, and all parents and nature lovers should rave at the penguins' parental dedication and sacrifice shown in the last wilderness on earth, thankfully mostly unharmed by human interference so we could see the real story just as it has been played out for centuries. Wonderfully well done film; don't miss it."
22,March of the Penguins,8,31 July 2005,Incredible cinematography; good story,"It is amazing that any animal can survive the months of unfathomably harsh weather depicted in this movie. As told in Morgan Freeman's excellent narration (the English version), emperor penguins have been doing so for thousands of years. At least they are built for it, with oblate spheroidal bodies that maximize volume to surface area and a thick layers of fat and fur to help them survive the tremendous winds and unimaginable cold. As the movie shows, they are also uniquely built to protect the eggs and newborn chicks from the drastic conditions that can even kill the adults.What is perhaps even more incomprehensible is that this was filmed by humans surviving those same conditions. Certainly they had the advantage of technology, but it is hard to imagine living for days, or weeks or months in the Antarctic winter, much less carrying equipment and patiently waiting for the subjects to get used to your presence.The only flaw in the movie is what will also endear it to many of those that see it: it is edited in a way that seems to give these animals too many human qualities. Throughout all the hardships of survival, from the courtship ritual through the caring for the eggs and newborn chicks to the ultimate return to the preferred environment of the sea, the penguins seem to show happiness, sadness, love, satisfaction, grief and a range of other emotions in very human ways. These are not after all short people in tuxedos, they are animals acting instinctively. Granted, they do it in an extreme environment, but they are animals nonetheless."
23,March of the Penguins,10,21 June 2006,Too Amazing To Describe,"This documentary showing what a group of penguins goes through on a yearly basis in Antarctica is almost too unbelievable to express in words. To use the cliché, you have to see this to believe it.When I saw it, I remember almost being stunned afterward at what I had just seen, and then thinking about it for a few days afterward, which is not something I usually do. It was just a haunting, unbelievable story....and 100 percent true, not one of these ""based"" on a true story fiascoes. The hardships that these flightless birds endure to keep their species going is almost impossible to believe. No sense in me detailing it: just check it out. I have yet to hear a friend say anything less about this than I just said: all of them were amazed."
24,March of the Penguins,9,6 January 2006,Such a touching film,"Here in Finland there are two versions of this movie played in cinemas. The original, French spoken version with Finnish subtitles, and the second version which is dubbed in Finnish. I went to see the first one mentioned. When I went to the cinema I was expecting something like a beautiful nature film with magnificent landscapes and talking penguins. I was wrong. It's much more than that! The fact that the global environmental conservation organization WWF was in the project, it was crystal clear that there is also a lot of extra dramatization. This is seen very clearly in the film. The film is trying to make the whole audience to feel pity for the penguins with some sad and some funny scenes. The music is also very touching and effective in many scenes, but I didn't realized why it had to be English sung music (why not French) with that synthetic background beat. OK, the singing was beautiful and touching, but I think the music had been better without that background beat in some scenes! Even so, because of all the beauty and the emotion, the film was about to make me cry (probably the first time in my whole life in cinema).One thing that separated this from an ordinary nature film was the style of commentary: the voice of the narrator wasn't actually meant to be just a voice of a man and a woman behind the scenes, but the voice of penguin's thought. In my opinion this was a great idea: it works well and makes the idea more entertaining.Everyone knows that the life of an animal isn't easy at all. This is shown in the movie, but thanks to fine editing, the scenes ""not-for-small-children"" (including raw and mating scenes) are cut off and edited wisely. These scenes have been made to be much more sensitive than for example in nature films and that is why they fit much better also for small children, I think.After all I think this is one of the most touching movie I've ever seen. It is very well made, and if you like nature films you got to see this. It's a great entertainment for the whole family. Just have to hope there will be made more films like this one in future."
25,March of the Penguins,9,15 July 2005,Creates an Amazing Sense of Kinship Between You and the Emperor Penguins,"This movie is extraordinary in that there are no human actors, it is a documentary, there are no special effects, and yet it manages to enchant, enthrall, excite, and bring an audience to the brink of tears. Though ""March of the Penguins"" has a feel-good quality to it, rest assured it is not Disney-fied and will not nauseate you with Hollywood's mawkish sentimentality. The joys of two penguins falling in love (do birds fall in love? I don't know but it sure looks like it) and successfully raising a chick is neither subdued nor overdone. When a penguin couple loves, you can feel it, when a penguin suffers -100° snowstorms for the sake of its egg, you can feel it, when a penguin grieves over the loss of a chick, you grieve as well.Perhaps a little guilty of anthropomorphizing these creatures, Jacquet nonetheless demonstrates that penguins and humans are a great deal alike. There were moments when I wondered if the birds' behaviors could be interpreted as humanly as Jacquet leads you to believe, but by the end of the film he fully convinces that penguins and people are a lot more alike than we could have imagined.A film like this can make you start wondering if we are genetically more related to penguins than chimps! ""March of the Penguins"" creates an amazing sense of kinship between the viewer and these tough, admirable, imperfect, and courageous birds."
26,March of the Penguins,10,29 July 2005,March of the Penguins,"March of the Penguins is a beautifully made movie that gives you a rare glimpse into the life of an Emperor Penguin. Details were shown about penguins that I had never realized before. Most fascinating to me was the father's role in keeping the baby chick safe while mom returned to the water for sustenance. It was heart-breaking to realize that an unhatched egg exposed to the harsh winter air would die in seconds. You could feel the pain that the parents felt when they realized that their chick had not survived. The intricate ballet the parents performed when transferring first the egg, and then later on the chick was amazing to watch - it was an almost perfectly choreographed dance.Their lives are extremely hard, much more than I realized but they seem to have an indomitable spirit to live in a land where many do not survive. Humans believe they have it so hard, but the life of the Emperor Penguin gives us a lesson in the determination and will to live when and where many others would have given up. With their backs against the frigid and unrelenting wind the group stands together as a unit to nurture their children and to protect each other from outside forces.Another factor in the movie is the scenery; the sunrises, the brilliant blue skies, they are stunning and absolutely breath-taking and revealed that Antartica, although an inhospitable place for humans to live, is a beautiful land with stunning vistas. March of the Penguins is that rare movie experience, inspiring and eye-opening without being preachy. I thought I was knowledgeable in what I knew about penguins, but I quickly discovered I was not. Highest recommendation!"
27,March of the Penguins,10,30 July 2005,U.S. narration NOT the same as what was shown elsewhere!,"Morgan Freeman's U.S. script was wonderfully written. There were no voice overs for the babies. He did not talk too much or too little. This was a different kind of documentary. It wasn't meant to give us a science lesson on ""The Life of Penguins"". It was meant to show us what they endure to follow their instincts, travel across the SOUTH POLE, not the North Pole, to the place where they were born, mate, survive the harsh winter, how they share parenting duties and how cute the young are before they go off on their own. There were things in this film that I didn't know about penguins. I was thoroughly entertained, moved and pleased. If you are an animal lover you will enjoy it. If you saw Duma and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this one. Don't let the negative comments influence you. Hey, one movie ticket is worth two Grand Latte's. Splurge!"
28,March of the Penguins,7,4 September 2005,"Love, maybe - but I have to wonder","This was certainly a visually stunning movie, but I was left with questions that weren't answered. There seemed to be a lot of males wandering around without eggs, and females, later, without chicks. Do they actually stick around if they aren't raising their own, instead of returning to the ocean? Do they adopt orphans, those mothers who return to find their mate dead or their chick frozen because it hatched too early or those fathers who return to albatross-eaten chicks: do they adopt the chicks whose mother/father never came back from the seal-haunted ocean? Or do those just die? I also wonder why, if losing a chick is so ""unbearable"", the females just stand around watching as the albatross attacks the chicks. Their ""love"" for their chicks certainly seems narrow, if deep. But unanswered questions are okay... Oh, yes - I also wonder what kind of lens they were shooting that leopard seal with: generally they aren't but twice as long as emperor penguins (up to 10 feet, with the birds nearly 4), and that one looked immense. (And speaking of the seals - they have babies, too!) My real quibble was with the relentless personification of the environment. Winter isn't really trying to kill off the penguins, I mean, come on. It's just weather - it's not some malevolent spirit. Still, the movie is good - stunningly shot - and the penguins are pretty amazing creatures. Do yourself a favor and watch this."
29,March of the Penguins,9,22 August 2005,An outstanding nature documentary,"It was a real treat to go to the theater for once and not a watch guns, explosions and over the top drama. Instead, this film is about the drama of life in the Antactic. Other comments will give you ample information about what the film is about, so I won't waste time and space writing about that. Instead, I will write about what I liked. The wide shots were cinematic in scope, and breath-takingly beautiful. There were plenty of close-ups of the penguins. Watching these noble creatures waddle about and occasionally slip and fall was good clean fun, and elicited laughter in the sparse crowd of the theater. The film and narrative is not overly sentimental; in fact, at times it is brutally honest about the harshness of life in that stark and cold environment. Finally, contrary to other opinions, I found the voice-over excellent and well-written. Morgan Freeman has an outstanding voice for this type of work. And I will say that I actually liked the music, and felt that it worked well with the action on-screen."
30,March of the Penguins,7,18 August 2005,a tribute to nature's spirit of endurance,"As informative as it is entertaining, the phenomenally popular documentary ""March of the Penguins"" demonstrates that life can flourish even in the remotest corners and harshest environments on our planet.Director Luc Jacquet and his valiant crew of seasoned filmmakers spent a grueling winter in Antarctica getting up-close-and-personal with a group of penguins who turned out to be anything but shy when the cameras started rolling. The team recorded the complex mating and child-rearing ritual the penguins have been acting out on their own private little continent, far from the prying eyes of the outside world - until now, that is - for thousands upon thousands of years. After the penguins have marched seventy miles to their breeding ground, the males and females pair off into monogamous couples to do their thing (fear not, worried parents, the film stays within the pristine parameters of a ""G""-rated, family-friendly feature here). Then, after the egg has been laid, the male and female trade off responsibility for protecting their progeny against the brutal cold in a fashion that can only make many exhausted mothers in the audience green with envy. Then we watch as the eggs hatch and the pint-sized young'uns finally get a taste of the challenging life they've been brought into this literally cold, cruel world to lead.Although the photography doesn't have the sparkling clarity one would find in an IMAX film on the same subject, ""March of the Penguins"" still does an amazing job placing us right in the center of the action, be it on the ice as the penguins huddle for warmth against a raging blizzard or under water as the exhausted mothers search for food to bring back to their hungry babies. The movie is both funny and touching, keeping the inevitable anthropomorphic silliness to a decent minimum. The narration (voiced by Morgan Freedman) occasionally veers towards the sappy, but, for the most part, it stays levelheaded and informative, while the music ranges from the moving to the soupy.""March of the Penguins"" may be no more than a Discovery Channel feature blown up to big screen proportions, but it's still more fun to watch than most of the fiction films in theaters these days."
31,March of the Penguins,8,16 August 2005,"Great documentary, with great filming techniques, and good voice over by Morgan Freeman","I just went to see this today, and I'm glad I did. It is a good story that is shown through natural situations, and is told by Morgan Freeman. His voice over work really added a lot to the movie. At times, some of the things he said were funny, and some times the things that happen are sad. Some humor is present, such as how the penguins are compared to humans. March of the Penguins follows the penguins in Antarctica from the moment they jump up from the water, to the moment the baby chicks grow up, and swim off to live in the ocean on their own. It shows the ancient ritual of the penguins, their march across Antarctica. Along the way they endure harsh conditions, mating, birth, loss, responsibility, gathering food, avoiding predators, and raising their young. This movie is good at making you feel delighted, and at the same time, it shows how many of the penguins, and the baby chicks die through natural occurrences, and some die because they are taken by predators. This is a great movie for kids to see, because they will learn something, and will probably be delighted by the penguins antics. Adults will also like this movie. It has elements of a nature special, but it is taken to a new level, it tells a story like a movie. At this day and age, most movies rely on special effects and sound effects to entertain audiences. This movie doesn't rely on special effects, but on story and quality.Another great thing in this movie is the camera work and cinematography. The shots are very well done, and the underwater shots are incredible. In the underwater shots, they certainly made the predators look intimidating.I highly recommend this. It is great for kids, because it will teach them something, and adults will also enjoy it. It is very well made and very watchable. Special thanks to Morgan Freeman for the excellent voice over."
32,March of the Penguins,7,14 August 2005,"Fantastic cinematography, but...","Going into this movie, I had no idea of the premise, other than it was tagged with National Geographic and that Morgan Freeman was the narrator. The first encouraged me, the second did not. Upon reading the credits, I saw that Luc Jaquet was director  a Frenchman. Having watched many French movies over the years, and a long time follower of Le Tour de France, I was expecting excellent cinematography, and I was not disappointed.From the opening narration, I knew that this would follow penguins (Emperor as it is) through courtship and birthing period. Of this I am used to, having watched Discovery Channel for years. The various nature shows I have seen about the struggles of life, death, birth, and a variety of other parts of life, engaged my curiosity and set my standard. Perhaps, that set my standard too high.I was also put off having recently watched (finally!) ""Million Dollar Baby."" To me, having Mr. Freeman narrate ""March of the Penguins"" was too similar, and almost too popular, to give this movie a feeling of completeness to match my intellectual curiosity.And I was right. The four of us who watched ""March of the Penguins"" walked away from this it with more questions than should be allowed, all about the life of the Emperor Penguin, and very little about the movie itself.But don't take that I didn't like the movie  I enjoyed it tremendously. I just would have been satisfied watching it muted. Perhaps I will rent the movie and do just that.And watch the closing credits, they are fun!"
33,March of the Penguins,9,30 July 2005,Review on US Version,"The US version contains a beautiful score with only Morgan Freeman's voice portraying the events on screen in delicate detail. The landscape is breathtaking and the film will engage both child and adult audiences.This film follows the trek of the Emperor Penguin during their migration to breeding grounds in the interior of Antartica. The director portrays all aspects of their harsh surroundings as well as the realities of life, death, and birth with a deft hand.I plan to purchase the soundtrack which added another layer of expression to the backdrop of the Antartic. The flute and bassoon duets were outstanding and the music seems to stand on its own."
34,March of the Penguins,10,27 July 2005,"Heartwarming, heartbreaking, beautiful achievement of film","I would generally not have gone to a film like this. However, the word of mouth and advertisements for it convinced me otherwise.'March of the Penguins' is an inspiring tale of the beauties of life: birth, death, and most importantly love, life, and family. If not for this movie, I would never have known the plight penguins go through for family and love. Who would have ever thought that penguins instinctively experience what we as humans strive for within our own lives. There were moments when I could sense the 'human feeling' within the penguins, especially in moments of loss.In watching this film, I found myself laughing, almost crying, and generally having a warm feeling within me.I applaud the filmmakers, for showing the world one of the most wondrous tales I've ever seen."
35,March of the Penguins,9,24 July 2005,"Truly Amazing Penguins, but lacking depth in explanation of them...","I loved this movie. The visuals are amazing and I never knew what the Emporer Penguins went through to find a mate and become parents. It makes me realize how truly amazing these penguins are and how disappointing we are. The G rating does miss the real point of them. There was so much left unexplained due to the harshness of Mother Nature. I feel a certain anger knowing how much pain can be caused to these little creatures, so innocent and so pure. I must say, if the director would of focused in more on this, I don't think many people would have been able to sit through the movie. I know I would of probably cried my eyes out. It's funny, I can sit through any horror movie and have seen real human death, but this, like the baby harp seals, is very hard on the soul. The difference being the penguins are not hunted by humans, some of them in this movie suffer such pain that's almost sadistic and makes me want to scream at some higher power for letting this happen. We humans can learn a lot from these Penguins, I know I have....................."
36,March of the Penguins,10,27 July 2005,Wonderful family film,"I am not much of a documentary film fan. But I'd heard only good things about March of the Penguins and was intrigued by the idea of a film that documents nature in the harshest place on earth. The movie did not disappoint and the opening shot of the icebergs was worth the price of admission. The shots of all of the baby penguins was just an added bonus.It's a National Geographic film and does not pull any punches covering the circle of life; but nor does it over-dramatize it. There were pre-school and elementary school kids in the theater who did not appear to be disturbed at the death scenes. The movie is short enough (an hour and 24 mins) that young kids, or adults with short attention spans, will not get bored.Who knew the penguin dating scene mirrored the human one so much? Anyway, I laughed a great deal and was inspired. Hey if penguins can march 70+ miles in -80 degree weather to get food, then I can't complain about walking 20 feet to the mailbox."
37,March of the Penguins,10,21 January 2007,The best documentary ever.,"I thought this film was one of the best I've ever seen. I love penguins, when i go to London Zoo they're all i look at. This film has made me love them even more.As much as i love penguins, i knew little about them before seeing this film. It was educational, without making me feel like i was back at school. It really captured the journey that emperor penguins go through. Morgan Freeman was an inspired choice as the narrator, only Steven Fry rivals him as a voice over artist. I would like to see more nature documentaries released in the cinemas, they'd be much better than films with bad acting and poor story lines."
38,March of the Penguins,9,2 January 2006,An incredible documentary,"I have seen this film knowing what to expect, and it fully met my expectations.It makes me wonder when I read reviews from people expecting this to be some sort of an action/fantasy film where they can take their kids to and expecting them to be entertained. This is a documentary, if that means anything to them, but perhaps they are just too bored with their lives to appreciate this kind of work.. It's not enough that you have here a crew of truly motivated documentary makers travelling for a good long year to the harshest place on earth to make this happen. They film in horrifying conditions one of the most unknown species of birds in our planet at times risking their own lives to accomplish this, I suppose they were expected to make the penguins talk or have them sword-fighting against their predators so that these people could be ""entertained"". Jesus, if they found this boring, how would they rate any BBC, Discovery top notch documentary? Or there are people that actually prefer to slag the penguins off for not being intelligent enough or not caring enough for their chicks. Yes they are just birds, they don't have feelings, rather they act on instinct or on species preservation. Isn't this beautiful enough? no, I suppose penguin mothers really should take their own lives when their chicks die. But then I guess these people would rather prefer there was no fauna or flora in the planet or that is certainly not worth knowing about.This is an incredible documentary, I could still enjoy this with no sound on the TV at all, no offence to the script or to Morgan Freeman's vocal and drama/operatic skills or to the score, it just looks awesome. Life truly is a gift and watching this reminds me of how lucky I am to be breathing into this world.A must see."
39,March of the Penguins,9,12 August 2005,It is not easy to be a penguin...,"Penguins might look all cuddly and laid-back, but they are in fact really tough. They have to be tough since they need to survive some of the harshest conditions on earth. Without seeing this documentary, it is just impossible to imagine the endurance they are capable of for completing the task of procreation.This is NOT Madagascar played in real settings. This is a true story about the basic drive for continuing the species against all odds, about animals that stubbornly and faithfully stick to the necessary rituals they've performed for centuries to breed and raise their young, no matter how hard and even fatal they are. The theme of survival makes this film not only a picture of wonders, but also of a lot of heart.At the same time, of course, tens of thousands of identical empire penguins marching before gigantic icebergs under an auroral sky is nothing less than visually stunning. One could only wonder at the amount of likewise unrelenting field works involved in shooting this amazing documentary. We salute those who have captured such intriguing spirit of life for all to enjoy and marvel."
40,March of the Penguins,,3 August 2005,March Madness.,"Emperor penguins in Antarctica struggle with the harsh elements and flying predators as they attempt to breed and get food to survive. Director/co-writer Luc Jacquet's National Geographic documentary feature has loads of heart and personality. In this day and age of rotten and unremarkable characters in movies, Jacquet's little tuxedo birds share their trials, triumphs, tragedies and tribulations with no strings attached. Harrowing narration by Morgan Freeman (for the American version) tells the heartwarming and often heartrending treks that these magnificent animals must take each year for their very survival. A haunting score (one of the better of recent memory) and top-notch cinematography are more than enough reason to give this picture a try. Likely will be more of a curiosity than a classic, ""March of the Penguins"" is nevertheless a fascinating and endearing experience that has that special unspeakable quality that few movies have. 4 stars out of 5."
41,March of the Penguins,8,30 July 2005,Very Good,"This movie was very good, and even though it was pretty much a documentary, it was entertaining and fun to watch the antics of the Penguins and also enlightening to watch the struggle for life that lasted the entire breeding season and, in truth, their entire existence. All that raw footage had a sobering effect on me and for penguins, they have expressive features. I can't imagine anyone other than Morgan Freeman to be narrator. His voice was perfect. On the whole, this was a movie that I would recommend to anyone who has an interest in wildlife, and I hope that it comes to DVD. I was a little surprised to discover a documentary in Theaters, but it was a refreshing change of pace to some of the movies that have been released lately."
42,March of the Penguins,7,23 July 2005,All that for a Chick?,"Greetings again from the darkness. This documentary had two effects on me. First, the photography and scenery is stunning. Second, penguins seem to have survived despite their lack of evolution. The magic of Antarctica is captured beautifully. The stark ice desert is amazing in its isolation and brutal environment. For whatever reason, for thousands of years emperor penguins have made this same trek at exactly the same time of year to exactly the same place for the sole purpose of procreation. This isolated spot provides relief from most predators but causes incredible hardships on mother, father and chick penguins. I am no scientist, but it is a real head scratcher as to why this creature does something so difficult for them and has made no strides towards a simpler or more effective method after all this time. As a movie watcher, I definitely enjoyed the amazing photography as the rituals of marching, mating and surviving are captured on film - including some terrific close ups of these flightless birds. The photography overcomes what is a horrible score and less than exciting narration from the normally outstanding Morgan Freeman. Still worth seeing, although kids under age 8 will undoubtedly be bored. This one will keep you from ever feeling sorry for zoo-kept penguins again!"
43,March of the Penguins,9,22 July 2005,it wonderfully brings me back to my childhood...,"In my childhood years, I loved watching documentaries on tape from National Geographic, especially on wildlife. I was always fascinated in how those in the wild (and the endangered as well) go through life, how they eat, how they struggle and persevere, how they mate, etc, and the craft behind the documentaries was equally fascinating. March of the Penguins, which is the first documentary in this vein that I've seen in many a moon, is no exception. While for many who aren't (or weren't) big on those documentaries or the Discovery channel or other may wonder what's the point in a film about penguins, for a particular audience it's like candy that doesn't really rot your mouth. It's simple storytelling, and it creates a kind of spell on those who find animals interesting. I'm sure those who love penguins will make this a must-see event of the summer.There isn't a ""plot"" really, but as the narrator takes us through the story (here being the instantly recognizable Morgan Freeman), we learn how the Emperor Penguins deal with life on the surface of Antarctica. They come up to breed, and then lay their eggs and bring up their young, but their struggles are many- the deathly, way below-zero cold, the arduous walk across the tundra to feed, and the care that must be taken with the chicks when they're hatched. All of this is done in almost a mini-epic kind of way, and director Luc Jacquet (and his DPs Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison) does some amazing visuals. Although many who see the movie won't take it much into account (and it's sort of taken for granted), the cinematography is crucial for a film like this, and on that level the film works on levels that match up and even surpass the documentaries I watched as a child. After a while, I almost forgot there was tough craft in this, which is also remarkable- that they were able to film these creatures in this environment, without being too obtrusive, and make it seem cinematic.For all ages, March of the Penguins is a little gem in a summer flooded with remakes and sequels, and the fact that it's becoming the sleeper hit of the season (it's reportedly made more per-screen than War of the Worlds) is equally surprising."
44,March of the Penguins,9,28 June 2005,Visually outstanding; narration text poor,"This is a visually outstanding movie, BUT I would like to have learned more about how they could have actually shot it in the Antarctic at 50 below zero. My first thought was - why didn't the cameras freeze up? I also thought the narration was not as good as it could have been. Not Morgan Freeman speaking, but the text. In some cases, they repeated facts two or three times. And they left questions unanswered - such as, if a mother penguin did not return, would another mother either with a chick or who had lost a chick, feed a motherless chick.I also would have liked a better explanation about the penguin pairings, and the ""love"" that is spoken of. Is that anthropomorphizing, or has that been actually studied and proved? It is hard to believe that between birds, more than actual instinct is involved.But all the romanticizing aside (perhaps the luckiest people in the audience were those that could not understand the audio), it is still an incredible feat of photography and an awesome look at these remarkable creatures."
45,March of the Penguins,5,28 September 2005,Not A 'True' Documentary,"What most people don't understand is that this film is not a true documentary or natural history film. It is instead a screenplay, a story if you will, that attempts to anthropomorphize penguins, while giving factual information on their yearly migration to their mating grounds in the Antarctica. Simple as that. I thought the cinematography was of excellent quality and was enhanced by the well chosen sound track. However, I found Morgan Freeman's narration skills just did not work well here. He sounded so monotone and just plain dull. I would have enjoyed the film better just by watching and listening to the soundtrack, with no narration. If you want to see what I consider the very best in natural history/documentary series and films, seek out the many fine works of Sir David Attenborough. If you've never had the privilege of viewing any of his works, and you enjoy true natural history documentaries, you just don't know what your missing."
46,March of the Penguins,6,9 September 2005,Footage is great...narration leaves much to be desired,"Your feelings about this film will, of course, depend on what you're looking for. If you want a cute movie with some beautiful footage that tells a nice story about penguins, then you won't be disappointed. But if you're of a more critical inclination, without much taste for saccharine and simplicity, then you might find yourself a little annoyed by Morgan Freeman's narration in this film. The English version of the narration, at least, serves to anthropomorphize the penguins' ordeals at every turn. This may make the ""story"" accessible to a broader audience, but to me, at least, it came off as condescending and manipulative. For example, Freeman sagely explains that the father penguin feels remorse when it has to leave its chick for the first time. How can we know what the penguins feel? This tactic of imposing human emotions onto the penguins is employed, to ill effect, throughout the film. I think it may have been better to stick to facts, and to state so explicitly when statements are speculation (like how the penguins are feeling). There were also points when the film was emotionally manipulative. (I know, pretty much every film is emotionally manipulative.) For example, the seal is presented as the ravenous villain, whereas we are used to having seals depicted as charismatic and lovable. What, seals are carnivores? I thought they were those cute little creatures always getting chased around by those big bad killer whales. My point is that things are not simple, and that it seems disingenuous, even deceptive to depict complex, mysterious things as simple in order to make them appealing.My fundamental reservations aside, the footage is great and the story is well told for what it is."
47,March of the Penguins,6,9 August 2005,"A Pretty, Irresistible Tale Told in a Too Corny Way","""March of the Penguins (La Marche de l'empereur)"" is a pretty National Geographic nature film. The visuals are lovely, but there is little science.The English-language narration by a nicely dry Morgan Freeman, adding more richness than his tone in his ""War of the Worlds"" voice-over cameo, avoids any mention of evolution and wincingly anthropomorphizes procreative instincts into romantic relationships.But the nesting habits of penguins are an incredible, irresistibly involving tale, almost Ripley's Believe It or Not, to get to see - and doubtless filming it was too, though I presume we'll only get the photographers' tale on the DVD.The harsh realities of nature are shown frankly enough, even though edited to avoid a PG rating, that a toddler in the audience yelled out at a predator bird ""Go away!"" and declaim this as a ""bad show"" when it didn't listen to her plea.The music is a bit corny.It was very ironic that this was playing in NYC in an art house theater where the adjacent screen was showing ""9 Songs"" restricted for 18 years+ tale of another male in Antarctica with sex on his mind."
48,March of the Penguins,8,9 August 2005,a jaw-dropping marvel of how a species manages to survive against all odds,"MARCH OF THE PENGUINS (2005) *** French filmmaker Luc Jacquet's amazing feat of documenting the migratory and living patterns of the Emperor penguins in the icy, foreboding no-man's land of Antarctica (sub-zero temps and bone-chilling environs) is a jaw-dropping marvel of how a species manages to survive against all odds in the elements, behavior and simply attempting to procreate will have many in awe and wonder if not for the chilly how-the-hell-could-anything-live-there locales shot to the awww-factor of how cute baby penguins truly are. Produced by The National Geographic Society and a cut-above the atypical nature documentary by the likes of PBS and its ilk.Narrated by Morgan Freeman with his usual gravitas."
49,March of the Penguins,,22 August 2005,Death of a Wombat,"There's something about melodrama that we cannot avoid. We seek it out. We impose it on politics, sexual relationships, even traffic accidents as we drive by. We seem to need it.Nowhere is this more constant than in animal stories, stories about the struggles of creatures that we equate to that of humans. In this case, they seem more human than, say, lions. They walk like people more or less. They caress and swoon. They are loyal and experience despair. The ""children"" play like ours do. All this is shown to us in a way made to emphasize the ""human"" drama of the thing. Why do we find it appealing? Because it abstracts what we know about ourselves, or so we think when we want to see the world melodramatically.About 30 years ago, this unseemly tendency was satirized by an Australian radio program called ""Death of a Wombat"" where a narrator took us through the most horrid of dramatic excess. In its day, that excess was so extreme, it was comic.Well, over the decades we have experienced melodramatic inflation so the even more ridiculous tone and script of Morgan Freeman is considered as an honest rather than a comic account.I suggest you watch this it you can with your ears closed and an eye towards the brilliance of the thing cinematically. The melodrama is bit repulsive.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
50,March of the Penguins,2,6 December 2005,Penguins are not people!,"The wonderful cinematography of this film was ruined by the moronic voice-over of Morgan Freeman, who rhapsodized about the human qualities of the Emperor penguins.How does Morgan, or anyone else, know what a non-speaking member of another species is thinking or feeling? If you could watch that film with the sound off, you would come away thinking those penguins are outstanding little animals, who have adapted and thrive under some of the harshest conditions on earth. But the director seems to think they cannot stand on their own merits; they have to be anthropomorphized. Too bad.And too wrong! The smarmy details dished out by Morgan Freeman aren't even accurate! Emperor penguins don't mate for life, unless both members of the couple arrive back at the nesting site at the same time, and nobody better (whatever that is to a penguin) happens along.See it with someone you love, and turn the sound off!"
51,March of the Penguins,3,3 September 2005,The emperor penguin's new clothes?,"Pointing out the numerable problems in a critic-proof film like *March of the Penguins* will doubtless make me come across as a real sourpuss, but I'll give it a shot, anyway, because the movie has become eminent enough, and its faults interesting enough, to merit a rebuttal.Mainly, the anthropomorphism throughout the film is nearly intolerable. Yes yes, we're all living creatures on the same planet, and most species share essential functions of biology, but director Luc Jacquet photographs -- for example -- a pair of mating emperor penguins as if they were Jean-Louis Trintignant and Anouk Aimee in *A Man and a Woman*. The slow-motion rubbing of beaks, the bowed heads as if they are whispering romantic nothings to each other, the daytime soap-opera score tinkling in the background, eventually amount to manipulative hokum of the first order. It's also unscientific as hell: scientists have yet to conclude that animals ""fall in love"" as we understand the phrase. And yet the movie announces this thesis from the get-go. After the opening credits, a penguin bursts up onto the ice from the chilly depths below, and Morgan Freeman intones that this little fellow will do a number of foolish things ""for love"". The ever-present proverbial Professor once again must brandish his Red Pen and scrawl with irritation ""PROVE???"" in the margin. These particular penguins are monogamous for the breeding period only; other species show monogamous behavior for the entire span of their lives. But monogamy and love, as any divorce lawyer knows, are not synonyms. The filmmakers take a step further down this slippery slope when they label a mother penguin's loss of her chick as ""unbearable"" for her. Unbearable for us, certainly. But do we have the empirical data supporting the notion that penguins, or any other animals, suffer grief in the same way that we do? When this mother afterward attempts to ""kidnap"" another penguin's chick, the motivation is attributed to maternal agony and desperation: mightn't it rather be a coldly calculated behavioral instinct? I'm frankly shocked that National Geographic would put their imprimatur on such unscientific nonsense. Perhaps the Society feels that movies like these are needed to instill into sociopaths like oil executives and redneck hunters the idea that all species on this planet deserve our empathy and respect, but taking the low-road to achieve that aim isn't doing anybody any favors, least of all the penguins themselves.In any case, the movie's thesis sort of falls apart at the end when the nuclear families of the penguins abruptly disintegrate: the adults beat a hasty retreat to the water for fishing and cavorting, leaving the darling chicks to fend for themselves on the ice. ""The chicks will never see their parents again,"" Freeman says sadly. No postcards, no birthday greetings on video-mail. So much for anthropomorphism. Turns out after all that people are people, and birds are birds.*March of the Penguins* is most successful doing what documentaries like these really do best: educating us on the ways of creatures different from ourselves. You WILL learn about the breeding cycle of the emperor penguin. I just wonder why acquiring this knowledge necessitated such a grim slog through speculative moralizing, accompanied by a tear-jerking score. A real documentary, including interviews with scientists, would have been more edifying. For instance, an expert maybe could have explained why the Antarctic would permit such an imperfect creature a continued existence there. One thing I wondered about was why emperor penguins don't have pouches to store their chicks. Clearly, adaptability is not the same thing as perfection. Or the paucity of natural predators necessitates a high mortality rate. Who knows? The movie successfully shows the hows, but doesn't address the whys in a scientific manner. Apparently, the penguins do it all for love. Okay.3 stars out of 10."
52,March of the Penguins,6,8 November 2011,"Brilliant, but what happened to the music?","I seem to have an older DVD-release of this documentary than the version in the trailer here on the IMDb and iTunes. The documentary itself and the voice over is absolutely brilliant, but the new ""disney-music"" they have added to the movie is disturbing. This is a harsh environment, and for me this change of music is ruining the authenticity of the documentary completely. A friend of mine saw the version that I have of the movie too - he really enjoyed it so much he bought a DVD copy himself. But was very disappointed when he realized the music had changed dramatically. If I could rate the documentary without the ""disney music"", I would definitively vote for 9. But, for now only 6."
53,March of the Penguins,,3 January 2007,"Beautiful, touching movie.","This is more than a documentary. ""March OF The Penguins"" is a lesson of life and a positive message for humanity. No kidding. If you are able to watch this movie objectively, please, try to understand the penguin's cycle of life and compare it to humans. Well, it's sad, moving, but also delivers a lesson about compassion and love.Few things can be commented about this movie because if I get into explaining how penguins live, and how they reproduce it would be like decreasing the interest for the movie. You need to watch it to feel the special vibe of it and also get interested by the events.Truly, I was very moved by this movie and made me feel sensible. It impresses me how a documentary can provoke many emotions.The score is also fantastic and the narration is perfect. I watched the sub-titled version.Well I can't praise this movie enough and I recommend it to everyone who would like to view a different movie with the style of a documentary.This is another reason for people to love penguins."
54,March of the Penguins,10,24 December 2006,March of the penguins is an excellent documentary!!,"March of the penguins is an excellent documentary of the life of penguins. I saw the English version which was Narrated by 'Morgan Freeman'. The complete life of penguin is shown to its perfection. The penguin is a bird and yet it cant fly, it can swim but it spend most of their life marching across the massive ice of Antartica. I was very much amused of this very intelligent bird, making their survival on this planet for several thousand years. This short movie runs for about 1 and half hour shows the complete dedication of the makers of this movie. There was lot of amazing frames which shows the parental love, romance, happiness, sorrow, survival, fear of this amazing creature. The capture of the birds journey and underwater capture were amazing and hats off to the whole team, they did an wonderful job!I just loved it as everyone would!"
55,March of the Penguins,8,4 December 2006,Heartwarming...,"""March of the Penguins"" is a look at the annual journey of the Emperor penguin as they march across over 70 miles of frozen Antarctica, in a single line, to their traditional breeding ground. The film is directed by Luc Jacquet, and narrated by Morgan Freeman (the English version is, at least).While I can't comment on the acting, as there was none, we are treated to some of the most amazing footage ever shot to film, including an underwater segment showing the penguins eating and being eaten. On land, we see the penguin masses huddled together to get whatever warmth they can get while braving the harsh Antarctic winter, as well as predators and other dangers. All to raise their young.In closing, ""March of the Penguins"" is an astonishing and heartwarming film for all ages that I highly recommend to anyone."
56,March of the Penguins,8,28 November 2006,"An exceptional piece of work. Well worth seeing, especially if you are interested in wildlife.","This is a fascinating and visually stunning documentary, made by the flimaker luc Jacquet. Spending more than a year chronicling the course of an emperor-penguin colony in Antarctica, in temperatures exceeding -50. It's narrated by the mellifluent Morgan Freeman, doing an excellent job of explaining what you are seeing on screen.The documentary chronicles the travails of emperor penguins in the Antarctic through a year's cycle of mating and reproduction. The courtship begins with a walk of many hundreds of miles to their breeding grounds.After which they find a mate and produce an egg, then the females leave to return to the sea and feed while the males patiently nurture and warm the egg for 2 months, and then nurture the hatchling in extreme winds and cold temperatures. They wait in hope, for the return of the mother penguin. I say hope because of the risk factors involving dangerous predators and the harshest conditions on earth in search of their food source/s. The roles of the penguins switch and the story continues....I was captivated. The filmmakers certainly deserved their Documentary Oscar award for the travails they went through to capture the penguins' odyssey, throughout the depths of Antarctic winter.It's a fascinating film for all ages, and although the film is realistic about the fates of some of the chicks and birds who don't survive the winter, it doesn't dwell on it and the few deaths shown are not overly gory or traumatic."
57,March of the Penguins,9,1 June 2006,The Emperorers of Ice,"It is the resonance and easily recognizable voice of veteran actor Morgan Freeman which narrates this cinematically acclaimed feature film. Through the enduring and certainly Hurcleanean efforts of director writer, Luc Jacquet, we view the icy rugged life of the Emperorer Penguin on the silver screen. Audiences around the world have enjoyed and praised this incredible film which depicts the awesome and forbidding life of the tuxedo wearing birds of the Artic. From it's beginning, the Emperor is seen traveling across some of the most hostile and lifeless terrain in the world. Enduring frigid temperatures well below freezing, the penguins select a life-time mate and then contracts themselves to raise a single chick in a bleak, barren and often desolate world. Somehow, through each terrible stage of it's life, the males and females of this Arctic species of bird, illustrate how they have adapted and survived for centuries. In doing so, they earn the heartfelt praise of any audience capable of understanding the importance of courage in the face of adversity. This film is highly recommended for anyone wishing to visit the Emperors of Ice. ****"
58,March of the Penguins,8,27 March 2006,Warms up your spirit,"""La marche de L'empereur"" is more than a mere documentary, since it doesn't focus or presents the facts as the most important part of the observation. It is an amazing translation on the main events of a penguin's life to human thoughts on life and love and that is exactly what you feel when you watch it. Even if you are a hardcore movie goer, it will still be hard to be interested in anything but the little details of the amazing life of very mysterious beings in severe conditions filmed with a very unique and rare human look. Makes you wonder at the natural selection process and the beauty of its final result.Watch it and chances are you'll end up with a renewed and warmed up spirit. 10/10"
59,March of the Penguins,8,24 February 2006,"A narrative documentary: engaging, beautiful, and fairy-tale-like","This is an excellent feat. The film-makers have taken a yearly biological ""march"" of penguins, added story and voice overs, and created a story! I marvelled throughout at how human the emotions were, and how captivating the story of finding,losing and re-finding a soul mate is.The film is exquisitely photographed and the setting is reflected by the colours and photography. The wideness of the landscape and the bleakness are offset by the penguin colony and the struggle for survival, almost against the odds.The music and the songs create atmosphere in a way that words can't: brilliant interpretation of the songs written for the film. The voices are brilliant, the sub-titles engaging.A fact has been taken, made into an engaging story. See this documentary. It's really refreshing."
60,March of the Penguins,7,9 February 2006,Frozen Melodrama,"The real star here is Antarctica; ice and water as nature's architecture. The opening flyover sequence is treated as a flyover of a city to establish setting. Bit by bit, the eye focuses in on the 'citizens'. Since this is a character study, we have to imbue the 'characters' with human attributes, otherwise it's reduced to wrangling. I understand that the penguins, mother, father and chick are given 'voices', in non-English versions of this. It makes Freeman's narration seem utterly harmless here...at first. Until we get to the intonings of 'unbearable loss', 'joyful reunion', 'love', and 'quality family time together', and so on...sorry, it's all melodramatic goop.But it's necessary as juvenilia...otherwise, it gets demoted to just another Discovery channel special.Definitely ignore all the auditory aspects, and instead take in the sight of a thousand huddled black bodies in a -80C blizzard, or of the cracks spreading in an egg that freezes before your eyes, or the cerulean world of water beneath the ice. The visual competence alone saves it."
61,March of the Penguins,9,9 February 2006,Fascinating documentary,"One of the most beautiful documentaries I have ever seen. The story of these penguins living in the coldest place on Earth is both beautiful and unbelievable. Also amazing to see is how they can only survive as a group by making a giant penguin. Of course it is also funny to see how limited they are walking around on the land. But once they hit the water they are amazing animals. The underwater part is fascinating, it is almost as if bullets are flying by when they swim. The most beautiful scenes are when they launch themselves out of the water onto the ice. The music in combination with the beautiful shots make this a clear Oscar winner.9 out of 10."
62,March of the Penguins,8,7 January 2006,Amazing Story of Devotion and Persistence,"Every once in a while (too seldom, actually) we are somehow reminded of how delicate life really is. Often the reminder comes with the death of a loved one. Today one such reminder came to me, but in a film. That film was ""March of the Penguins.""The documentary skillfully illustrates the instinctive mating ritual of the Emperor Penguins of Antarctica. It is truly an amazing story. It includes an annual 70 miles hike (with the penguins, that would be a 70 mile waddle) to the breeding grounds. After mating, the male incubates the egg while the female returns 70 miles to the sea to bring food back for the chicks. It takes many months for the process to unfold, including the winter months at the bottom of the earth. With temperatures at -80 F, and winds over 100 MPH, it is an environment that will kill part of the colony every year. But the ritual goes on...The birds are serial monogamists, staying with one mate for the entire year, then finding a new one the next. But during that year, the tenderness and devotion are astounding. Making such a film is test of the physical endurance of the film maker and the crew. Suffice to say that if someone suggests spending a season with the Emperor Penguins, politely decline. It's a task only for the brave, and/or foolish.If you think you had a bad day at work, or if the IRS wants to audit you, or if your new car was just totaled by an uninsured teenage driver, rent this film. Your problems will seem insignificant compared to a winter in Antarctica without food or shelter. And you will have a better understanding of how delicate life is without losing someone you love."
63,March of the Penguins,7,7 January 2006,A story of love and of penguins.,"'March of the Penguins' is a powerful documentary about the story of the journey of the penguins in the mating rituals. The documentary follows a group of penguins in their natural habitat to the place where they mate and care for their young until the young are old enough to care for themselves. It's a documentary about life in the south pole as much as it is about the penguin because life evolves around this habitat. This documentary makes the viewer appreciate nature and life a little more, especially when the first glimpse of the baby penguin shows on the screen. This shows the success that at least one pair of penguins have had in this aspect of life and the harsh conditions that they had to endure. Along with the film comes comedy and sadness and adorable baby penguins. It is shot beautifully with great observation of nature and good composition. This, combined with the soundtrack, is pretty powerful and moving. Morgan Freeman also did a good job in the commentary/narration of the script. What a nice documentary that has been educational and fun and has let me learn about this aspect of the lives of penguins, which I did not know anything about before."
64,March of the Penguins,7,4 January 2006,A struggle which is beautiful and astounding.,"""March of the Penguins"" is a documentary by French director Luc Jacquet. He shows us the annual struggle that penguins go through to preserve the life of their newborn. He brings us to Antarctica to show these penguins in their natural habitat, and captures perfectly the dangerous, seemingly impossible task of survival that these animals achieve. The bleak, icy surroundings look beautiful, still and almost tranquil at times but harsh at others, and the director captures this brilliantly. Morgan Freeman narrates the process, and adds a ""star quality"" to the film, giving simplified meanings and insightful facts. The underlying theme to this film is the struggle against adversity or nature, and in my opinion one of the most beautifully directed documentaries i have ever seen.7/10"
65,March of the Penguins,6,5 December 2005,It was PBS-tastic.,"Well, you knew there was bound to be someone out there who wasn't blown away by ""March."" No, I'm not jaded, or indifferent, or hate sickeningly cute animals; this film had a lot to like. But after reading pages and pages of reviews from bedazzled viewers, I get the impression that far too few Americans watch educational television shows on TLC, Animal Planet and PBS. I honestly feel that if more people watched less mindless programming, they may not be so easily impressed.To start with, I will agree and say that the cinematography was incredibly impressive. I envy their underwater lenses and want one. <3 Their aerial shots, underwater shows, and that the camera crew could get so incredibly close to such docile creatures was interesting indeed.I can also see why so many people were impressed with the animals' devotion, being that so often we as a species are generally lacking. But really and truly, there are more animals that are equally interesting, monogamous for their entire lifespan, and have humans and diseases to contend with, like wolves or chinchillas.Morgan Freeman is a very nice choice for narrator, but I'll disagree with comments about the amazing-ness of having him do it; Mr. Freeman isn't the first celebrity voice over for a documentary, and certainly wont be the last. PBS is good like that.It's worth a watch, and will make you diabetic if you stare at the fuzzy penguin babies too long, but maybe only for renting or babysitting entertainment purposes."
66,March of the Penguins,9,8 October 2005,A well-spent and very satisfying afternoon at the movies,"Although we know that it is only about birds, the powerful documentary March of the Penguins, directed by Luc Jacquet, allows us to see a little bit of ourselves reflected in their instinctive rituals. March of the Penguins has all the elements of classical drama: romance, tragedy, loss, and the struggle for survival against heavy odds. What it takes for a penguin family to survive is not that much different than what it takes for us humans: partnership, communication, joint risks, and shared goals.The filming crew, consisting of director Luc Jacquet, cinematographer Laurent Chalet and Jerome Mason and composer Alex Wurman spent a total of thirteen months filming in the Antarctic and has given us an experience of breathtaking beauty. The footage of the penguins swimming in 1700 feet of water looking for food is little short of amazing as they hold their breath for fifteen minutes and do everything to avoid the predator leopard seals who see them as a meal. The film, which opened in limited release on 132 screens, was seen on 1500 screens by the first week in August, having grossed $16.7 million. It is that rare film that will entertain all members of the family and even spark an interest in science.Originally shown at Sundance in a French version, it was a cutesy mixture of talking penguins and pop songs performed by Emile Simon. In the American release, however, the penguins only chirp and the only one who talks is narrator Morgan Freeman, as only Morgan Freeman can - in a tone of subdued awe. Penguins are birds that swim but cannot fly. They walk upright like man, but there the resemblance ends, though some of us have been known to waddle a bit as we get older. Although penguins have been around a long time, 40 million years to be exact, most of us know very little about their mating rituals and how they survive in the minus 80 degree Antarctic winters.The film tells us that each year they must leave their home in the ocean and march single file to their breeding ground seventy miles away, the place where each of them was born. When they are tired they simply flop on their bellies and slide along the ice. They have fortified themselves for the treacherous journey through snow and heavy winds by feeding in the ocean for the past three months. Like couples on a dance floor, when they arrive at the breeding ground that is thick with ice, they choose their partner and pair off.What qualities they look for in a mate is not known but there is no lengthy courtship and no need for dinner and a movie. They huddle together in the thousands for protection during the frigid winter as they await their egg. When the egg arrives, they perform a delicate transfer from the female to the male so that ""she"" can return to the ocean for food. Any exposure to the cold even for a split second and the embryo will freeze to death. The eggs are held on the tops of their feet protected by a flap of skin and the fathers go without food for up to four months as they huddle together for warmth until the females return.If they survive the ocean, they return to their hungry spouses who by now have lost half of their body weight but somehow have enough strength in reserve to go back to the sea for food. Unfortunately some of the older ones will die along the way. When the father returns, he finds his chick instinctively through their unique sound that only a parent could love. When the babies are strong enough, they head out on their own to experience their first dip in the ocean. It is the end of the cycle and the harbinger of a new one. Thank you Mr. Jacquet for a well-spent and very satisfying afternoon at the movies."
67,March of the Penguins,9,17 September 2005,Delightful documentary,"My woman friend and I were entranced by this excellent little documentary. The unique complexity of the mating and breeding of these Emperor penguins is amazing and moving. At the end I did have questions and longed for more information about these fascinating creatures. A friend commented to me that you could see much the same thing in a TV documentary special (and in fact, National Geographic produced this film). True enough, but this one is worth seeing on the big screen in the theater with an audience. The photography is stunning; I am rarely cold in a movie theater, but the portrait of ice and cold winds made me shiver. Stay for the closing credits and the inset of the photographers with the penguins."
68,March of the Penguins,9,17 September 2005,"I will NEVER complain about my ""hard life"" as a human again!","Wow. What an eye-opener MARCH OF THE PENGUINS was. I thought I knew everything there was to know about penguins: That they are cute and live where it's really cold. I didn't know half the story! The Emperor penguins live under the harshest conditions imaginable in the coldest place on Earth. Many years ago the weather wasn't like this but as it evolved and got terribly icy and cold and the other creatures either died or moved on the Emperor penguins chose to stay and learn how to adapt to the changes. If you think that means that the penguins are ""fine"" with the cold, think again. Try watching scenes where the penguins are huddled together in the teeming snow and wicked winds. They each take turns being the one in the ""middle"", the lucky guy who gets the most heat for a brief moment. Then it's someone else's turn and you have to stand on the outside of the circle using your body to shield the elements off your fellow penguins. That sucks! The penguins eat fish. The only way to get to the fish is to go where there are cracks or holes in the thinner ice, dive in and eat. It would make sense then to live where the ice is thin, right? Wrong. Because when it's time to lay eggs, guard them with your life, hatch them and then take care of a new chick the penguins have to find the area that has the hardest ice possible to stand on. And, yup, that just happens to be miles away from where the fish is! A lot of this ""love story"" focuses on how the penguins trek to their mating grounds, pick a mate, woo and mate, and then make an egg. The scenes of the penguins mating were trluy touching. A lot of nature shows show crazy, wild, beast sex. The penguins are a slow, romantic breed and watching them cuddle up together actually brought a tear to my eye! Penguin love: the most sensual love of all. Who knew?! Penguins keep their eggs warm by keeping them on their feet, hidden under their big bellies. The mothers and fathers actually take turns feeding, storing fat, and bringing food back for the baby. This whole ordeal actually takes months so the father holds the egg while the mother feeds and then a few months later the mother holds it when the father feeds. They have to carefully pass the egg back and forth without dropping it, using their feet. If the egg touches the icy ground the egg and baby are ""ruined"" and the whole March has been done in vain. Once the chicks hatch (and, yes, they are really , really cute!) the game of passing them back and forth on your feet continues. It is not easy to keep a new chick alive, which sadly, the movie does show. I could go on and on telling you all about penguins and all about the movie but I won't: The best advice I can give you is to go see the movie yourself. And bring lots of Kleenex! I burst into tears about four times during this movie. It's one of those films where just when you think the heroes have overcome their biggest hardship, WHAM, something else gets thrown their way. You will truly wonder why they've accepted this difficult life style and how they have the pluck and bravery to go on. What's more important, you will find YOUR life of riding the subway, going to work, raising kids and arguing with your mate a breeze after ""waddling"" in the steps of a penguin. I saw this with my 60 year old mother and my 6 year old child: We all loved it. The movie theater had small children in it and I was sure a few ""bored"" ones would raise a ruckus. They didn't. Everyone in the audience, young and old, was captivated by the charms of the adorable penguins. P.S: Is it just me or do the penguins have the most beautiful, emotion-filled eyes? Look at the way they look at their mates and their babys. (Grabs the Kleenex again!) ********* out of **********."
69,March of the Penguins,6,3 September 2005,March Of The Penguins,"March Of The Penguins, is a French film although we have the English language narration here in North America. The film shows penguins as they make their way home once a year through very cold temperatures with ice and snow. The film also shows how they feed and take care of their young and what the penguins do to survive and shows their every year journey. March Of The Penguins, is from National Geographic, so it is no wonder the film feels like a full length version of a nature show. The film is interesting, has a lot of charm, has some visually stunning scenes showing the penguins on land and when they dive under water, a beautiful looking film with good cinematography, and is a film that is educational and neat to look at and is something that older kids will like too and with the G rating it is a fine film for them to see. Some people may not like it though because it is a documentary and with any documentary you should be interested in what the film is on before you go see it otherwise you will not be entertained at all. So for those who don't like nature shows or magazines then this movie may not be for you. It may also even be too long for some people even with a short running time of 80 minutes. I liked the film well enough with it's beautiful scenery and interesting knowledge of the penguins and what it shows us about them though and the film makes a good movie for a matinée."
70,March of the Penguins,,28 August 2005,"Educational, evocative, astonishing, poignant","This movie was beautiful in its unadorned journey with these amazing birds. It was also horrifying in its harsh, otherworldly Antarctic panorama.As much as I was not looking for an anthropomorphic take on the story--and I didn't get one--there was something both ""us"" and ""not-us"" about the penguins: lovely, tender, humorous. I took them personally as the film unfolded, anxious that they succeed, anguished at those times when they didn't.I was astounded at what they endured in the endless cycle of life. I'm an animal person, fairly well informed on many species, but I had no idea whatever of the particulars of their existence, their survival within conditions that are so unutterably terrible to me, as a human being, that I could never begin to understand, or withstand, them.Seeing their instincts for survival and so many other qualities at work that every creature shares, including us, it made me profoundly sad to know that they will continue their unchanging cycles in a vastly changing world, one in which none of our conditions will be the better for the changes."
71,March of the Penguins,9,20 August 2005,A Nutshell Review: March of the Emperor,"This film is a celebration of life, love, danger and death, as seen through the eyes of Emperor Penguins in the Antarctica. Most people will come to know of this documentary from its quiet successful ascension on the American Box Office.** For those who do not want to know the story, you may skip this part ** ** SPOILERS START **We follow the penguins in their annual ritual in making life, beginning with long marches on ice to their mating ground. There, there look for their partners, and begin their ""one night stand"". The eggs are laid, and the moms go off to gather food their future chicks, while the dads stay behind to look after the eggs and shield them from the cold.When the chicks hatch, the moms will have returned, and begin their feeding, while it's dads turn to go fish. It's like an interchanging of roles between mom and dad in taking care of the little one, until such time when they've grown and can hit the ocean waters to begin their own life.** SPOILERS END **3 different narrators tell the story from different perspectives - the father, mother and child, Peppered throughout and assisting the narrative are the English songs (in a French movie, which seemed a bit odd), and the stunning cinematography will leave many speechless.You will ponder at the wonders of nature and life itself, with these penguins undergoing their rituals and knowing exactly what to do during certain times. Instinct? Probably. The theme of Danger and Death lurks at every corner, ever ready to pounce. As in the movie, you'll never know when to expect when Death strikes, though most of the violence happen off screen, and probably not as violent as what you can view on the Discovery Channel.It's a refreshing change to watch a documentary during this busy August and fall in love with the penguin chicks. I know many in the audience did."
72,March of the Penguins,9,18 August 2005,real life drama,"It may not be this summer's blockbuster but having started in only a few selected theaters it spread nationwide. I predicted this movie's success two months before it was shown in a few theaters when I saw the movie trailer. Then confirmed after watching it.... Maybe people in America are coming to their senses and getting tired of the usual Hollywood recipes - sci-fi movies like ""the Island"" suck, they are a waste of money and good actors. The penguins did not need special effects, fake icebergs or overpaid writers to keep the public interested during its 85 minutes. The movie is real drama, no science fiction added. Hollywood movies should be made ""organic"" instead of ""genetically modified""."
73,March of the Penguins,,17 August 2005,Movie every parent should watch,"This movie is about the annual journey the Emporer Penguin makes to it's breeding ground in the most hostile place on earth - Antartica. It is about how the penguins mate and care for their young in often -80 degree weather. This is a movie also about a superior being, a far better parent than most of us and an example of sacrificial love to all of us. As a parent of a 4 and 2 year old I know what love and sacrifice means, but those words were redefined after watching this movie.I recommend that every young or aspiring parent watch this movie - it has changed my perspective on parenting it will change yours !Kudos to the movie makers for not only working in such conditions but for bringing us a window into the lives of these beings and by challenging us to be better ones ourselves."
74,March of the Penguins,9,16 August 2005,Great movie in a year of stinkers,"The kids want to go to a movie and mom and dad are confronted with the standard beat 'em up action flick, the stun ray sci-fi trash or some TV remake held together by Jessica Simpson's butt. Take a look for a theater showing the March of the Emperor (as in Penguin) and mom, dad and the kids will be enchanted.Greeted by the melodious fluidity of Morgan Freeman's voice, we learn the story of the massive Emperor Peguin, and their ritualistic habits that allow them to propagate. The story is National Geographic stuff, but the photography is stunning, given the barren nature of the Antartic. Be prepared for some tough scenes, though, as the story details both the successes and failure of the parents to be."
75,March of the Penguins,9,15 August 2005,"Hypnotic, Beautiful, Funny, Thought-Provoking","I hesitated to see this movie -- don't I get enough nature documentaries from PBS? And what new can I learn about penguins, anyway? I was wrong. ""March of the Penguins"" is a great movie, one of the best I've seen in the past year, either in a theater or at home.I wasn't bored. I didn't feel like I was watching something that I could have seen on PBS.No, ""March of the Penguins"" doesn't offer the twists and turns that a narrative film starring human actors can offer.It does offer hypnotic beauty of a place and a life most of us will never see.From the first shots, I was as if hypnotized, as if floating in an altered state.The images on screen are never less than perfectly beautiful. The Antarctic terrain is blue and white; the penguins are black, white, yellow, and orange. For the most part, those are the only colors you see. The best human artist could not have created more sublime images.The film's stars, penguins, appear human-like when filmed from a distance. They look like crowds, like pedestrians, like nuns or monks or members of some secret society, like you and me.It is in this similarity to humans that the film becomes thought provoking. Would we ever sacrifice for our children the way that penguins do? Given that penguins go months without a bit of food, in order to raise their young, the answer is plainly, ""No,"" no human ever has made that sacrifice. Sobering.Too, you wonder -- to what extent are these penguins wind up toys, merely following evolution's dictates, and to what extent are they thinking individuals? Pondering that question about the penguins causes you to ponder that question about yourself.I had more questions than the voice-over narration answered. I was especially confused by the final scenes involving penguin chicks. I won't voice those questions here, because I don't want to provide any spoilers.Except for that small quibble, this is an excellent film, one I can't recommend highly enough."
76,March of the Penguins,7,9 August 2005,"Bravo to ""March of the Penguins"" - steadily climbing the top ten chart (a fantastic No. 6 for Aug. 5 weekend)","Arduous, audacious, formidable piece of documentary by Luc Jacquet and film-making team - the awe-struck ""La Marche De L'Empereur"" is an intrepid year-long 'filmic' journey. One hour twenty minutes of endurance with love and survival of the unique kind, single-mindedness undeterred, dauntless under rigorous chilly wind and snowstorm, with starving and threat of death conditions notwithstanding - to faithfully keep, preserve and protect the young to be hatched from egg, fed and be swimming in the sea eventually.Morgan Freeman's voice-over narration is simply the perfect touch for the English-listening audience. Freeman just can't go wrong having been the moral fortitude to Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood in ""Million Dollar Baby"" 2004 - his omnipresence in 2005 is indisputable. Besides lauded at the Cannes Film Festival, he's the gadget-wizard to Christian Bale in ""Batman Begins,"" the blind 'angel' to Jet Li in ""Unleashed,"" the beginning and the end voice to the Spielberg-Cruise effort of ""War of the Worlds."" I've always enjoyed his divine role to Jim Carrey in ""Bruce Almighty"" 2003. Here he's telling us about the imperial tale of the March of the Emperor Penguins in Antarctica (at the Dumont d'Urville French Station).With the support of the French Polar Institute, writer-director-scientist Luc Jacquet, initially prompted by an ad (reminiscent of Shackleton's ""Endurance"" documentary) ""looking for fearless biologist, ready to spend fourteen months at the end of the world"" - armed with dedicated fascination, undiminished enthusiasm, and shared fervor of camera work by Jerome Maison and Laurent Chalet - who had ""to remain isolated from the rest of the world for a whole year"" for the feature film project. For detail production notes, full of intriguing facts and observations from the filmmakers of this unrelenting, majestic story, check out the official site from Warner Bros. (wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins).""March of the Penguins - as told by Morgan Freeman"" is a superior production of sight and sound experience, with music by Alex Wurman. Who are we, the human society that seem to constantly complaining, unappreciative of nature and material goods available to us - lacking the patience, fortitude and warmth of the Emperor Penguins, who waste no time in dissatisfaction but concentrate in simply living (and accept death as it happens being part of life cycle). Can we learn from them? Just might be worth pondering."
77,March of the Penguins,7,28 July 2005,Glad I saw this so I don't have to go to Antarctica to get the goods,"In the United States there is a dearth of nurturing father figure role models. Whether athletes, artists, celebrities or politicians, the prominent males of our society seem to do little to change or challenge traditional gender roles. Luckily we can turn our eyes to March of the Penguins and Antarctica to the emperor penguins to find dads that are willing to share the rearing equally with moms (not that this reviewer is suggesting that American males should go a few months without eating for the sake of their offspring as emperor penguins do although given another problem of American society missing a few meals might not be that bad an idea...).Narrated by Morgan Freeman at his most grandfatherly, MOTP is not a nature film in the traditional sense. One doesn't learn what makes emperor penguins different from other penguins, how they store food, how often they molt, where they live for the non-mating season, how they play or even much about what they eat. Instead, the film parses out lessons of love, life and death using the mating season of the emperor penguin as a backdrop for ideas that often are dropped quite heavily in fictional narratives. Early on when Mr. Freeman states that this ""is a love story"" he speaks the truthThe photography is as striking as one would expect for a film taking the best 84 minutes from a year-long shoot. Capturing many shots that prompt ""oohs"", ""aahs"" and ""awws"" (with neatly timed pauses in the narration for crowd reaction), the film is well-paced and remarkably engaging for not really having a story to follow. Especially uncommon for a G- rated film are the artful depictions of the arbitrary, tragic and brutal nature of death. Done in a way that children can both stomach and understand the film could be recommended for children for that alone. Alas though, MOTP is watchable for adults too. This eyes-closed arms-around-neck sloppy wet-kiss to emperor penguins is to be recommended to folks in search of a bit of uplifting entertainment."
78,March of the Penguins,,23 July 2005,A really great film and a tribute to those who did the on location work,"A lot of good things have been said about this movie along with some negative things. Overall I was very pleased with it. As always there are things that might have been done better but if they had been done the other way people would still have complained.I had great admiration for those who went on location. Even with all of the modern survival equipment that must have been a grueling time. The slightest mistake could mean death. I've worked with people who have gone to the far north and they tell me how quickly one could freeze to death by a simple mistake.What struck me most was listening to comments as I left the theater. Various people were commenting on how Anartica was at the *north* pole. As I hope most people here know, it is at the south pole. Also the breeding grounds were not at the pole itself but were within the antarctic circle (peroid without any sun at all). Another, more understandable error I saw in published reviews was a reference to the aurora borealis. Those are the northern lights. The commenter correctly called them the southern lights which are also known as the aurora australis. BUt I really had trouble biting my tongue as I overheard one woman teaching the young children with her that the penguins lived at the North Pole.ON the positive side, I learned a lot from just watching. In the past I've mostly seen penguins in still pictures or briefly at a zoo. BUt watching them in motion and doing things, I was struck by how truly birdlike they are. We have parakeets and the was a lot of resemblance in the way they move their head and do other things between the little parakeet and the giant emperor penguin."
79,March of the Penguins,5,28 July 2005,Did not meet my expectations,"I was expecting a masterpiece, and came away unsatisfied. The film's promoters compare it to Winged Migration, but it is not anywhere near as exciting; at many points it is predictable and even tedious. The music adds sentimentality instead of anticipation. The camera work is outstanding but would have been more so in smaller doses. Why must 4 out of 5 shots repeat what was captured earlier and become so interminably lingering? This was 1.2 hrs of film that could have been cut to 30 minutes. Sure the penguins' behaviors and their habitat are fascinating, but the adoring anthropomorphism of these animals really bothered me. How can we know penguins' emotions, I ask? How can we know that the loss of a chick is devastating -- in human terms --to the adult/parents? I regret that Morgan Freeman's narration, while certainly competent, was so slow and so ponderous. It did not add to any lift to the film. In fact, there was not a shred of humor or cleverness in the script, and the only thing I smiled at was the predictable waddling, penguin chicks' slips on the ice, etc. My recommendation: see it, but wait until the DVD."
80,March of the Penguins,4,16 November 2005,If only I had watched the American Version!,"Sadly I saw it at a German cinema and had to suffer through a narration that raises the scales of cuteness and melodrama to levels rarely seen before. Visually, the movie was a feast with huge impressive vistas as well as beautiful close-ups depicting the harshness of antarctic life and leaving you impressed that even in surroundings as hostile as these nature finds ways and means to keep on trucking. There was some (melo-)dramatization going on as well - the seagull attacking the young penguins, for example - but all in all it was not to the extent as to be grating. If not for ... the voice-overs! The audio was a real chore to listen to, to an extent as to spoil the entire film! The narration by a nuclear family of father (whiny), mother (wispy) and child (syrupy cute) humanizes the animals where the film doesn't need any humanization. This isn't 'Babe', for chrissakes, it proposes to be a documentary! Projecting human emotions onto animals is false and frankly an insult to humans and penguins alike. I'm aware that the German dub emulates the original French version, but I would have preferred Morgan Freeman's narration over this any time. Oh yes - the Kate Bush-lite score, though unnecessary, worked alright. Do yourself a favour: take along your IPOD and give yourself anything to listen to but that. Might be worth an '8'-Vote then..."
81,March of the Penguins,9,3 January 2006,Narration,"I have watched both the German version - which apparently closely follows the french original - and the totally differently narrated and scored English version and it is truly like watching two different movies: The penguin point-of-view narration with different voices appeared aimed at children and young audiences in general while the English narration by Morgan Freeman just gives you some important information.It is the same as with the music: The original version seems to be designed to change your perception of the images, while the English version lets the amazing and stunning imagery speak for itself, taking everything else a step back."
82,March of the Penguins,10,30 December 2005,An incredible journey for all of us.,"The theatrical release was awesome, but the DVD is better yet. Along with the incredible photography and narration of the feature film, the DVD offers additional short features. The first is a French naturalist who has been monitoring the Penguin population in Antarctica with concerns about how global warming is effecting their habitat. The 2nd short is ""the making of"", narrated by the men who filmed the Penguins, and in it's own way is as fascinating as the feature film.The comments in IMDb report that in the various versions produced for the world audience, (Germany, France, Taiwan, Japan) there are differences in the script and the editing. If I get the chance to view the European version, I will update my remarks with details on the differences and if theirs is more artful than the one made for the US market. It is difficult to imagine how they could improve on it.The bottom line is... this is a must see movie. You will have a new respect for these wonderful creatures who have adapted to one of the harshest environments on the planet."
83,March of the Penguins,10,30 December 2005,awesome,"this is film at its very best.One will experience every emotion watching this film. A true classic.Anyone who has a heart will want to own a penguin. I hope some of the profits from the film will go to an organization to ensure the survival of the penguins.I never imagined animals could be that courageous, loving parents.From the first march to the final dive home i was mesmerized by this film.I will be watching the Oscar nominations for this film, its sure to win best documentary.I rented this film AND WHEN IT WAS OVER I HIT THE REWIND BUTTON AND WATCHed it again.For gosh sakes see this film, it will touch you in a way no other film ever will."
84,March of the Penguins,10,21 December 2005,Astonishing!,"I have long been an admirer of penguins, so when this film was released in the cinema, my friends variously and collectively rushed to inform me of the film. I went to see it, and was amazed.The plot of the film is extraordinarily simple - the film follows the Emperor Penguins of Antarctica during their annual mating and rearing cycle. It is framed from start to finish in terms of the march - the march from the sea to the mating spot, the march to return to the sea for food, the march again for rearing the young, and the march again finally to return to the sea.There is a great deal of humour and grace; penguins are gentle beings, vulnerable to predators and to the hazards of the winter - despite being fashioned for some of the coldest climates on earth, they nonetheless require warmth, particularly for their eggs and the hatchlings. In the severe cold and far-below-zero windchills, many do not make it, and the one negative side of the film for me was a somewhat constant lingering on this downside. While it is a part of nature, it still becomes a bit more tragic in the cycle of the film than it needs to be. As this is billed as a family film, I worried that some of the children viewing might be more emotionally upset at this than they needed to be.Still, the details presented are fascinating, and it is a true testament to film-making that these shots and images were captured as dramatically, humorously, gracefully and beautifully as they were.This film has 'Academy Award' written all over it, in many categories. Cinematography, musical score, directing, documentary - these are only some of the categories in which this film is likely to get a nod. Morgan Freeman never appears on camera, but gives a wonderful reading as the narrator of this visual feast, adding subtle emphasis that never detracts and often adds to the tale in the English-language version of this film.Director Luc Jacquet and cinematographers, Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison have produced a masterpiece that transcends language barriers (indeed, there is no native human language for Antarctica). A French team, they have translated this film into many languages around the world, as people everywhere will find something with which they can relate.Perhaps the most skillful part of the filming was to make Antarctica seem so varied in texture and place; on a continent covered with ice and snow, one still gets the sense of the length of the journey, the beauty inherent in the surroundings, and the dangers involved for the penguins.Through the credits, one gets to see the film crew in some light-hearted scenes with curious penguins. These are expanded upon in the DVD version, with many more scenes of penguins swimming, diving and feeding in truly remarkable filming. There is also a Warner Brothers short animation as a bonus. The audio track can be done in English or Spanish (French is also available as subtitles) - because of the nature of this film, overdubbing in different languages is in no way a detraction."
85,March of the Penguins,10,18 December 2005,I didn't realise penguins were so damn cool,"When I sat down to watch this film, I didn't realise how much I would grow to love penguins. I found myself laughing when they were having fun, and close to tears when times were hard.One of the first things you notice about this film is the beautiful cinematography. Obviously they have had a lot of help from the scenery, but the filmmakers have used it to great effect. There is an incredible panoramic scene following quite literally thousands of penguins in a line that will take your breath away.This is without doubt, the greatest documentary I have ever seen. I you come out of the cinema without a desire to obtain a penguin, you have no heart. Pure genius."
86,March of the Penguins,10,14 December 2005,"Emotionally compelling, gorgeous and epic","The penguins are exquisite. They almost look unreal they are so precisely sculptured and painted, their graceful bills sliced from the rim of the moon, their red and black lines like something from a designer of fine tuxedos, their round, dough-boy bodies with their flippers like little wings, their stoic non-expressiveness otherworldly and heroic.The desolate and forbidding Antarctic landscape with its immovable walls of blue-white ice and its black, rocky outcrops and the great blue and black sky above is awesome and awe-inspiring, beautiful and frightening, clearly another world as distant from our experience as another planet.And the story of the seventy-mile trek away from the ocean in which the penguins are so wondrously at home, where they fly through the water like something propelled, quicker than cats in their pudgy streamlined costumes, where they are expert and gluttonous fishers of fish, is nothing short of epic. At first they march together (and glide when they can over the ice like snowmen on their bellies), male and female to the place of their birth seventy miles inland, taking tiny child-like steps. And then they pair off and mate (the graceful courtship shown, the actual mating tastefully framed so that what we see is no more graphic than shared hugs), and then, as they stand huddled in a great mass against the wind and cold, the fertilized egg develops within the female and at length the egg is laid.And here the story becomes especially instructive for modern human parents. The egg is carefully, oh, so carefully and with some haste transferred from the feather-covered warmth of the mother's pouch to that of the father's. The transfer must not be careless or too slow because the fierce Antarctic cold will freeze the egg and the chick within in seconds. Then the mother leaves her mate and her egg behind and begins the trek back to the ocean so that she can eat once again, and can return with rich, oily, protein-packed food from her belly to regurgitate to the chick that will be born in her absence.Meanwhile the fathers stand together in their living mass against the cold and wind and snow, rotating in some semi-automatic manner so that each penguin spends some time on the periphery of the mass and sometime in the warm interior. And they do not eat. Months go by, and they do not eat. Finally the eggs begin to hatch and the chicks are born.And now the time for the mothers to return is nigh. And the chicks peer out of their downy pouches as though looking for their mothers, and they chirp. The fathers grow worried (I imagine) as they wait for the mothers to return and feed the hungry chicks. Each father has exactly one egg. Those who lost their eggs or never had an egg have left to return to the sea and to fish. When things get very desperate, the fathers exude from their mouths a little bit of mysterious white nourishment, enough to last the chick for a day or two, a crucial day or two.And then at long last the mothers return, one at a time in a line from over the horizon they come. And how welcome we can imagine they are! So this is a very human story, a story of monogamous parents who give everything they have to their progeny, whose struggles against the elements (and quick and hungry leopard seals in the sea) remind us of our own, except that ours seem relatively tame and not nearly as onerous.It is a gorgeous movie, best seen on a big screen of course with a beautiful score, a film that might be a little too emotionally demanding for small children, but one that will surely captivate older children and their parents. Highly recommended.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
87,March of the Penguins,10,11 December 2005,Simply incredible!,"I already knew the basic facts of the Emperor's terrible hardships -- but this film really brought it all home: The other-worldly Antarctic landscapes of stark beauty; The unbelievably dark and brutal winters. The production crew deserves congratulations for their own survival!The director could have emphasized that these majestic animals undertake to survive in the most brutal climate on Earth for the chance, just the chance -- on very long odds -- to raise a single chick. One egg. In the scenes where the chicks had graduated to the crêche, they reminded me of little Shmoos running about. Does anyone remember the Shmoo? ;o) -R."
88,March of the Penguins,10,11 December 2005,A superb love story.,"I just got the DVD of The March of the Penguins. I found it to fit right in with my theme of love today. Like The Phantom of the Opera, it also had lavish and eerie scenery. While as lavish as the latter, it was more spectacular because it was natural. Morgan Freeman's narration was superb and really set the tone for a love story that is incomparable! To see the penguins devotion for each other, their sacrifice, and their excitement was something nothing soon forgotten. And, if you are not captivated by those cute and cuddly babies, then you are just stone cold. I was so impressed that I adopted a Magellanic Penguin in the Falkland Islands so I could virtually have one of those babies for myself. What a love story!"
89,March of the Penguins,10,10 December 2005,Stunning,"This is an incredibly beautiful movie. It brought tears to my eyes numerous times. The love the male and female penguins show toward each other is stunning. What they go through to protect their baby is heartwarming and, at times, very sad.I highly recommend this movie, especially to animal lovers. Not only do you learn a lot about the way penguins live, you feel a connection with them. You can understand their determination and passion. It's amazing that these creatures live and reproduce in temperatures as low as negative 80 degrees. Also, I cannot stress enough how cute the penguin babies are."
90,March of the Penguins,6,3 December 2005,"Admirable Effort, but Rather Boring Result","I greatly admire those who filmed this movie. I can only imagine the unbearable conditions they faced to get the footage that ended up in the film. But as some have already mentioned, I have a feeling the best shots never made it to the big screen. I am a big fan of Discovery and Animal Planet, and am often enthralled by our natural world, but this film left me wanting much more. I suppose that in order to get the ""G"" rating, they couldn't highlight some of the more unpleasant aspects of the penguins' lives, but I would have liked to have seen more variety. What happens to the penguin left behind when one of the couple is killed? Does the remaining parent go searching for his/her mate at the expense of the egg? Do the chicks ever turn on one another? Do the fathers, who go months without food, ever cannibalize their young? How many of the chicks survive? What preys on them besides gulls and seals? Mostly what we see are penguins walking, and as cute as that is, it doesn't hold your attention for long. Perhaps this was meant to be more a love story than a documentary, and while there are some tender moments, those cannot sustain the film. I'm sure there is footage available that would have made this story much more interesting, for adults at least. But perhaps the intended audience was children, in which case I can't find fault for not including some of the more grim aspects of life, but I think my 10-year-old son was a bit bored by this as well. It just wasn't quite what I was expecting, given the stellar reviews."
91,March of the Penguins,,27 December 2005,"The facts and footage are impressive, the penguins are cute but as a documentary it is weak and the anthropomorphic delivery doesn't help","When this film came out in the US and did so well, it was reported in the UK as a surprise hit and a ""take that"" to the formulaic American films that generally make up the summer hits. So when it reached the UK I thought I would go and see it because I have found many documentary gems in the cinema over the last year or so. However what the American version of this film essentially is is just a typically corny Disney film full of animals and emotions  it is not a documentary. This became clear very quickly so I was able to forget about my hopes of learning anything or being overawed by the cold facts of nature.This is not to say that the film doesn't do this because it does have enough interest and amazement in it and the journeys and sacrifices of the penguins are fantastic. The conditions they endure are unbelievable and how (or why) they know to do it and the timings of it all is a total mystery that just baffled me. It also works as a sort of cuddly animal pornography which will totally win over anyone who has just come to gawp at the ""icckle wanimals"". There is nothing at all wrong with this; I myself found them cute, funny and easy to care about. Those into it will easily find much to be tied up emotionally in.So with the cute animals and the impressive facts I didn't need anything else to involve me in the film so the thing I definitely didn't appreciate was the manipulative anthropomorphic approach that the narration took. By attributing human emotions to them, this regularly turns the film into a mushy, sentimental cliché that never seems to trust the strength of the animals themselves  so when a chick dies we are not allowed to feel the loss of this cute beast ourselves, we have to endure the narrator telling us that the ""mother's pain is unbearable"" (a presentation not helped that the penguin has not the ability to express this emotion in ways we could recognise  even if it was true. Of course as humans we can feel this and, for animals this cute, we easily do  however the film didn't need to force it down my throat in the way it did. Freeman's narration is good when it is even and sparse but when he has to push emotions on his subjects I didn't like it; mostly though his gentle and warm voice worked well enough.The footage is amazing and it is more than worth coming for. The proximity they got to the penguins is amazing but the distant shots are also really well done. The end credits did include some CGI and special effects people but I'm not sure what these were for because I know the shots were real  perhaps effects used to clean up some footage to be clearer? Either way, Jacquet is a fine director of natural programmes on this basis and his footage did not deserve the overly-emotional delivery of the American version.Overall this is an OK film but it is certainly not a documentary. Many viewers will be enthralled by the impressive footage, taken by the scale and unfathomable nature of the journeys or, at very least, the wonderfully cute penguins. However even those into the emotions might the degree of anthropomorphism a bit hard to swallow at times. Not a great film then but ""cute"" and impressive enough to cover up for the massive problems that the US version has created for itself."
92,March of the Penguins,8,17 August 2005,"Great film, but voice-over avoids mentioning evolution","I loved this film. The cinematography was superb, especially when you consider the problems of filming in Antartica. My one concern was the voice over, which made a number of misleading statements. For example:Referring to the march the penguins make to the breeding grounds we hear they are ""repeating the journey they have made of thousands of years"" and that this is ""a cycle that has endured for centuries"" but penguins, as a species are millions of years old, so why would we believe that this march is a recent idea?In describing Antartica's tectonic drift from an equatorial continent to a polar one, any mention of timescale (hundreds of millions of years) is avoided, then claims that the continent ""stopped here"", which makes no sense, given all the other plates are still moving.My only conclusion is that the script was written so as not to offend creationists , but in doing so ends up misleading the audience. For me, this was a jarring effect and made me wonder how factual the rest of the information was."
93,March of the Penguins,4,10 October 2005,See Winged Migration instead,"I wonder if this is merely the product of a desperate attempt to make money off another bird documentary.This film really should have been left for PBS (or the Science or Nature cable channels given Bush/Cheney's ever increasing molding of public broadcasting into little more than political advertising).It's interesting occasionally, but it's not like they show you something you wouldn't see in a junior-high science film. In that sense, it really fails completely. The melodramatics are given far more attention, and the result is painful and boring. I love documentaries. In fact, I can't think of a documentary that caused me to nod off - until now.This seems to be the classic case of being able to put something people find cute on the screen to appeal to a mass audience. You expect that with summer and holiday flicks, not documentaries."
94,March of the Penguins,6,17 August 2005,They're freaking penguins!,"""March of the Penguins"" is the latest independent film phenomenon, garnering much attention, both critically from renowned reviewers and financially at the box office. But I still wondered how a seemingly mundane story, the Antarctic life cycle of the emperor penguin, could possibly be as good as hyped.The simple story traces a year in the life of emperor penguins dwelling near the South Pole. Most people know of penguins but do not know much about them. Thus the intrigue of the movie, learning about unknown creatures. While mildly engaging, that alone is not enough to garner interest for ninety minutes, but the quirky physical actions of the penguins do merit attention. Let's face it: penguins are weird, and their odd natural movements are what make the movie worth watching. Little things like a bird stumbling into a snowbank; bumping into a compadre; propelling itself out of the water; or the adorable youngsters doing almost anything. These things make you chuckle, as though watching a child curiously toddle around a park. That's the universal appeal; words are hardly necessarily and not always used in these scenes. The sole human voice is Morgan Freeman, who again inimitably delivers the narration, and his sympathetic grandfatherly tone nearly supersedes the script that too often oozes smarminess, although his natural gravitas may actually be a detriment as well, enhancing the words that over-anthropomorphize the penguins. They are freaking birds, clearly not equal beings, too frequently treated as as peers with similar feelings of love, hope, and pain. In the most blatant example, while speaking of the dramatic emotions that the birds feel when tragedy strikes, the over-the-top narration simultaneously generates an unusual combination of sympathy and eye-rolling. Many critics have praised the movie for its powerful emotion, but are moviegoers so starved for a decent story that simple nature is to be considered extraordinary? I think not. The effort is appreciated, but ultimately too much. The one element that could have salvaged ""March of the Penguins"" was the cinematography, which I expected more from. The icy natural beauty of Antarctica begs for spectacular scene-setting shots, something along the lines of ""Touching the Void"" or 2002's ""Insomnia"", but nothing special is present here. Maybe that was an intentional decision by the filmmakers to avoid distracting from the basic story, but contrasting the soaring surroundings with the literally down-to-earth penguins would have made the movie all the more fantastic on the big screen. Instead the filmmakers stick with unexciting shots highlighted only by the handful of close-ups that aren't too tight. Additionally several shots are less than crystal clear, perhaps hazy due to the conditions. But they are mildly distracting regardless, as are a few unusual confusing angles and some blatant cheating in the editing room, in which shots of seals were intercut with penguins to give the impression they were simultaneously sharing the same water. Things like this can be overlooked in bigger pictures, but when a movie is as simple as this one, the sometimes smaller components stand out and divert attention when they are subpar, particularly when they could have elevated the movie to greater heights.""March of the Penguins"" leaves one wondering why it was transformed to the big screen, because the movie is little more than a well done National Geographic special. Freeman's narration is a pleasant cinematic touch, but nothing else except the unctuous script distinguishes this from things seen before on television, despite the inherently amusing quirkiness of penguins.Bottom Line: Decent, but not spectacular. 6 of 10 at best, and far from a must-see."
95,March of the Penguins,8,15 December 2005,Fundraising for penguins,"I am a keen wildlife enthusiast and animal lover, having being a long term supporter of the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). I have also done voluntary work for amongst other groups, Friends of the Earth and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers (BTCV). Therefore, if possible, I would very much like to know if any of the money made from 'March of the Penguins' has gone towards nature conservation/wildlife, considering that it is the penguins after all which make the film and it has been so successful. I know the film has been a high earner because this was mentioned quite recently on either my local news in the North West of England, UK or the national news in the UK, I cannot remember which one exactly now."
96,March of the Penguins,9,12 December 2005,"Awe-Inspiring, Intimate Look at the Succession Process of Penguins","From ""Mary Poppins"" to ""Madagascar"", animated penguins have been portrayed as comical creatures with Chaplinesque walks and tuxedoed outfits. Real penguins have been spotlighted numerous times on the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet. Yet for all their familiarity to us through the years, the amazing survival instinct of the emperor penguins is still something to behold. A French film crew, headed by director Luc Jacquet, spent thirteen months in the hell-freezing cold of Antarctica where temperatures range from 58 to 80 degrees below zero.Over the course of eighty minutes, you will see hundreds of these penguins making a seventy-mile trek to a breeding ground in Terre Adélle where they find mates. Apparently they have to venture that far because they need to find a place where the ice is solid enough for laying eggs. Females naturally lay the eggs, which are all the more precious because they can only produce one per pairing, but it's up to their male partners to keep them warm against the brutal conditions. Males stay to perform this one task without food for over three months, as the females march back the seventy miles to get food through an ice break. Fending off predators, they hike back to the breeding ground to feed the little ones, at which point the males depart on the same trek to seek their food. What could have been mundane is actually quite fascinating.What sets this apart from other animal documentaries is the intimacy of Jacquet's gorgeous photography, which captures these strange creatures in a personalized yet unobtrusive manner. The stunning cinematography is credited to Laurent Chalet and Jérôme Maison. Some of the shots have to be seen to be believed, for example, the underwater shots where the penguins dart around speedily and attempt to avoid predators like the leopard seal. Jacquet used ""penguin cams"" to get their perspective when swimming, and the result is startling. The inevitable scenes of death do not seem gratuitous, even when a predatory bird swoops down on the chicks. We even see an intervention scene where a grieving mother who lost her baby unsuccessfully attempts to steal someone else's.Morgan Freeman uses his recognizable voice to provide the illuminating narration which granted, sometimes borders on the treacly to personalize the plight of the penguins. The DVD includes two good extras - a making-of featurette, """"Of Penguins and Men"", which lends Jacquet's personal perspective on the arduous filming process; and another short, ""National Geographic's Crittercam: Emperor Penguins"", which shows how the penguin cams allows us to see diving and feeding habits which would have been otherwise obscured by the ice. There is a trailer and even the classic Bugs Bunny cartoon short, ""8 Ball Bunny"", in which the rascally rabbit attempts to take a performing penguin to the South Pole even though he is from Hoboken (""Eeeeyowww...I'm dyin'!""). I always loved how the little penguin with the top hat cries ice cubes when in the bitter cold."
97,March of the Penguins,10,29 November 2005,breathtaking!!!!,"i finally watched this extremely moving documentary today and all i can say is mr. luc jacquet had better start making room for an academy award on his mantle, because this one is a sure-fire winner. what these beautiful creatures endure in order to preserve the survival of their species is nothing short of awe-inspiring. i came away with a renewed appreciation for the sheer gift of being alive. this should be required viewing for anyone, young or old, who has ever taken life for granted. this documentary, more than any other i have ever seen, captures the mesmerizing mystery of life and the herculean struggles some creatures endure just to ensure the survival of their progeny against all odds."
98,March of the Penguins,10,30 October 2005,Fascinating movie,"If you don't think adult Emperor penguins are beautiful and baby penguins are adorable, you'll be bored to tears. My husband and I both loved the movie. Morgan Freeman was great, letting some scenes stand without any narration at all. There were some children in the theater that really seemed to enjoy it, with parents answering questions after the movie. There's no sense in debating whether penguins have emotions or if it's instinct... I still felt maternal watching the trials and tribulations these birds go through to hatch and protect their young through the winter. It was -80 degrees Fahrenheit for God's sake! It's absolutely amazing that they're not extinct. This movie can be enjoyed by pro-choice and pro-life, evolutionists and intelligent design believers alike. Just enjoy the story for what it is."
99,March of the Penguins,10,5 September 2005,"VERY nice!  If you only see one documentary in a theater, make it this one!","Lemme just paraphrase what I wrote at the MST3K Review Message board...oh, and this contains a mild spoiler...if there can actually be such a thing as a spoiler about a documentary.To paraphrase Kevin Murphy, ""Documentaries are GOOD for you!"" I enjoyed this movie. I'm not a huge fan of documentaries, I'll admit. I'd rather sit through a comic book movie with lot's of explosions and bad dialogue than an informative history of Napoleon or the fight for survival undertaken by the Madagascarian Ai-Ai (a rare type of lemur, which is a rare type of monkey. Pretty rare).But I enjoyed this movie. My original thought was, ""I will pay money to support this because it's a DOCUMENTARY, not because I'll enjoy it. Maybe this'll help get intellectual films into the cinema."" But so help me, I enjoyed this movie.Now, I'll admit there were a few times that I didn't care for it. Once in a while I found myself wondering why it was moving so slowly. But the first one of those times only happened about an hour into the movie, and the other moments were few and far between.I think my biggest complaint here was when the male penguins left for food after the females returned with food. They lingered on that aspect just a bit too long for my taste...but as soon as the males returned again, the filmmakers wisely didn't show the females leave for food. They instead just said, ""the parents then swap the child back and forth as they journey for food, a journey that grows shorter with each trip as the ice between the hatching grounds and the shore melts, making the trip significantly shorter.Oh,...and Morgan Freeman did a fantastic job narrating this. I like this guy's work, although I've only seen him in a small number of movies."
100,March of the Penguins,8,29 August 2005,This is NOT a documentary,"This film is certainly poetic, inspiring, poignant. But I believe it crosses the fuzzy line separating a documentary from a fiction. Though I'm sure the story was based on penguin observation and research, the telling of it sounds far more like a ""historical drama"" which was ""based on actual events"", but took many liberties.I'm bothered by the notion that animals experience and express emotions the same way we humans do. The filmmakers chose to create this film in a manner that blatantly plays off our emotional responses, anthropomorphizing everything they pointed their cameras at.For example, the narration speaks of winter as if it were a god, ""doing everything in its power to stop the penguins."" The long winter is repeatedly referred to as a time of ""darkness"", in a very negative way. But I doubt the polar nights are very dark. There's an awful lot of stars, the moon, and those incredible auroras reflecting off an almost entirely white surface. Even to human eyes, it must be spectacularly beautiful. Imagine what penguin eyes, designed to see under water, must see?The love scene was shot in super slo-mo, edited to convey a sense of tenderness (that yes, actually brought tears to my eyes) not often seen in birds. In fact, when you see animals ""doing it"" in real time, it's rather abrupt and unromantic, by our standards. Also, in the bit where the mother penguin looses her chick, the narrator describes the loss as ""unbearable"" while you hear her moan. But how do we know what she is really feeling? Was that sound she made real, or was added to the soundtrack from another, unrelated event? Does that sound actually convey sadness to a penguin?I know I probably come across as a bit of a pill here, but I really dislike the romantification of Nature. If you're going to create a poetic, impressionistic film about nature, I much prefer the approach of Microcosmos: Leave out the narration altogether and just watch.And in an odd bit of irony, this film would seem to cater to children through its heavy use of metaphor and simplistic world-view, but it's too slow for (young) kids anyway. My daughter (4 1/2) started asking me if we could leave about half way through. She stuck it out to the end, cried once, but was rather blasé about it afterwords.You may be wondering why I gave 8 out of 10, after dissing it so much. Well, I have to give them credit for making a beautiful, somewhat informative, movie in what must've been incredibly harsh conditions. Also, I can't help but feel a profound sense of awe and respect for these birds. And relief that I am not one of them."
101,March of the Penguins,10,21 August 2005,Powerful film making and an amazing story,"This is one of the best stories I've ever seen on the screen. The scenery is fantastic, the characters are superb and the story is stunning. The hardships that these creatures endure to bring new life into the world is almost unbelievable. I'm in awe.Clearly, the team that made this were thoroughly dedicated to the project, as is illustrated at the end, during the closing credits, when they are shown hauling the large items of camera equipment over the frozen land. The underwater shots too, illustrating how graceful and fast the penguins are under water are superb.I saw this with my wife and 2 daughters, ages 7 & 9. There are some very brief moments of distress, but they didn't last long enough to upset my children."
102,March of the Penguins,10,19 August 2005,Memorable Night at the Movies!,"PENGUINS is truly one of the very best films of the year. A group of us (12) went to see this extraordinary film - 6 were children. My 8 year old nephew was most impressed, as were the others. Other words come to mind about this film: STUNNING - HEARTBREAKING - SPECTACULAR - - A MASTERPIECE! Bravo to the producers of it. And thank you, Morgan Freeman, for your wonderful and sincere narration. It was truly a memorable night at the movies for all of us. Let us hope that PENGUINS is one of the Oscar Nominees for Best Documentary - and why not Cinematography and Sound? 2005 is shaping up to be another great year for documentaries. March out to your nearest theatre and see this truly amazing film on a big screen."
103,March of the Penguins,10,18 August 2005,Awesome!  We left the theater overwhelmed by this powerful movie.,"My husband and I rarely attend commercial theaters, because we find the sound system in the movie theaters to be unpleasant and painful.Our interest in the Antarctic, and penguins, made this movie a must see. We were not disappointed in any aspect of this production. The awesome scenery, the ""Love Story"", the genius of the photographic team, and the gentle words of the narrator came together in a magnificent work of art. The sound system and background music was comforting in spite of the depictions of nature in its extreme. The narration was educational as well as entertaining. Morgan Freeman, the superb actor that he is, was a perfect choice for this project.Overwhelmed by this emotional movie, we left the theater shaking our heads over how any creature was able to adapt to the Antarctic, one of the most inhospitable places on earth. We were amazed at how these magnificent creatures were ever able to adapt such unique, specific behaviors, so critical to their survival.This movie was a powerful reminder of the fragile balance of our ecosystem. We were left with an increased awareness of the complexities of specific behaviors required for the survival of all species. It is most difficult for me to understand why the Emperor Penguin is NOT extinct."
104,March of the Penguins,10,17 August 2005,"A wonderful, childlike experience","It has been so long since I have seen a movie with children in the audience, and I have never been so glad to have them there. MARCH OF THE PENGUINS keeps both adults and children laughing, sighing, and awe inspired at the same time. The narration is amazing -- well scripted and not overbearing. The movie speaks for itself, and Morgan Freeman's voice helps accentuate and not obscure the natural beauty that plays out before the audience. Both the highs and the lows of the Emperor Penguin's journey are shown, though the lows are treated delicately so as not to alarm the younger crowd -- and the sentimental older crowd. There are points of sadness, and ample moments of laughter, including one moment that the penguins join in on. If nothing else, MARCH OF THE PENGUINS allows the audience to enjoy the complex simplicity of nature. Sound like an oxy-moron? Not for them. An outsider could never conceive of enduring what this species does to survive, and yet - for them - it's just how things are. So complex, and yet sweetly simple."
105,March of the Penguins,10,1 August 2005,Penguins marching,"Next time you complain about how cold winter is, think about how Luc Jacquet spent his summer. He and his crew went to Antarctica, the most brutally cold place on Earth, where they braved temperatures below -80* (without the wind-chill), to film the mating habits of Emperor Penguins. Every March (fall in the southern hemisphere), all of the Emperor Penguins leave their homes on the shores of the coldest landmass and march single-file to an area about 70 miles away. This is the breeding ground at which all of them were born.In some ways, they are like us. The males stand around and strut their stuff while the females choose their mate. Once the couples are decided, their lives are focused solely on procreation and keeping the egg alive. After the female lays the egg, however, she passes it to her mate--the videography is unbelievable!--and then travels 100 miles or more back to the shore to eat. The males stay at the breeding ground to care for the egg. The females then return to the breeding ground to feed their chicks, and only then do the males go to search for food.I was amazed at the sense of family. Everything they do is for the chick. Both parents quite literally risk their lives to keep their babies alive. What amazed me most is the sense of community among the Emperor Penguins. All of the females go to the ocean as a single group, while all of the males stay in one huge huddle, rotating so that each can spend some time in the warm middle, and some time shielding the group from the -80* cold and the 100+ mph wind.You don't have to be a nature lover to enjoy ""March of the Penguins."" It is a story of love of family and the importance of community. The frozen desert of Antarctica captured beautifully on film. And Morgan Freeman is regal as narrator.Note: Despite the G rating, there is some material which may scare little children."
106,March of the Penguins,1,9 February 2006,Boring,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILER* * MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* I know that a lot of people like this film. I didn't. I know that a lot of people found this film to be fascinating and interesting. I didn't. I found the film so boring that the 65 minutes of the film look like eternity for me. I had trouble keeping my eyes open(or as they say: I needed matches to hold my eye lid open). The problem lies in the fact that instead of trying to explain the whole phenomenon, they just showing it and unfortunately this is not interesting at all. The hype around this film is totally unjustified. The way this film has been used to justified moral crusading is simply making much more of a film that should be ignored.Conclusion: Avoid. A book or an ice cream would be much better."
107,March of the Penguins,10,21 December 2005,March of the Penguins,"This movie was absolutely amazing, fantastic, excellent...!!!It has insane graphics and oh my goodness it was great. At some times you will cry and at others you will laugh. I found it so amazing how these penguins would take care of these chicks with their life!!! They would literally attempt to steal another family's chick if their chick died!!! This travel (the march) must be the hardest out of all its just incredible how these animals who people usually don't remember about completely can go through months and months with nothing no food or water. I never will think of penguins as little wobbly birds who cant fly or anything, but i will think of them as smart amazing birds who can do anything possible and the most amazing birds in the world!!! This is an amazing movie and absolutely positively MUST MUST MUST...times infinity MUST be seen!!!"
108,March of the Penguins,,21 December 2005,"Narrated by Morgan Freeman, fantastic story of the Emperor Penguins of the South Pole.","The DVD is widescreen with surround sound. Super sharp picture, and for Antarctica, very colorful. It is billed as a National Geographic presentation, and was filmed by a French crew.What a remarkable story. Like the Salmon in a different part of the world, these penguins migrate back to their birth place to mate and hatch the next generation of penguins. That sounds pretty easy. But when you consider that they make the trek, across frozen nothingness, mostly in the dark, for over 70 miles, that's pretty fantastic. Then, after they mate and an egg is laid, it must be kept on its mother's feet for weeks, covered by a loose flap of skin and feathers, to keep it from freezing. Then, when the mother must walk the 70+ miles back for food, the egg must be transferred to the father's feet, quickly enough to keep it from freezing. Eventually the young chick must go from its father's feet to its mother's feet so dad can go get food, after perhaps 4 months of dieting. Then eventually the young birds are left to fend for themselves when springtime comes, they dive into the water to begin their 4+ years of living at sea, until it is time for their return to the birth place, to preserve the cycle.Any mishap along the sequence means a dead chick, and a number always fail to survive. But this fascinating documentary tells a centuries old story of how one species has adapted to perhaps the harshest climate in the world to keep itself going. Anyone interested in the world around us will enjoy this superb movie."
109,March of the Penguins,9,11 December 2005,Amazing film makes you think about the delicate balance of life,"This is an amazing film accomplished under unbelievably difficult conditions, in the winter of Antarctica. Like ""Winged Migration"", another French documentary, this movie has astounding photography. Also, like ""Winged Migration"", it gives the viewer a new appreciation for the struggle for survival in the natural world. The Emperor Penguins live under conditions that we can barely imagine. The extraordinary hardships they endure to bring the next generation into the world makes us more aware of the delicate balance of life. It made me think even more about the effect that global climate change will have on the future of life. It seems that even minor changes in the environment could destroy an entire population of the penguins. Don't pass up ""March of the Penguins"" thinking it is a boring documentary. It is an engrossing film, while also being enlightening and educational. My only problem with it is that I wonder how much the production of the film disrupted the normal routine of the penguins."
110,March of the Penguins,9,9 December 2005,a beautiful visual experience,"I'm glad that, free of any market constraints, the director and his team used the freedom they had to make a good movie. They played with the camera and with the ""settings"" and the result was a pretty impressive one. I especially liked the upside-down images in the water, how they used the water surface as a mirror, or the dramatic power of the scene with a penguin lost in a vastness of ice, far from the group.The soundtrack included some odd noises (natural or studio-made, I couldn't say) at some points, which accompanied well the strangeness of the landscape.On the other hand, providing penguins with voices and making them ""express"" themselves was, at least for me, not a very pleasant experience, when put next to the beautiful ""simplicity"" of the images. I saw the original version of the movie, in French, where the daddy, mommy and baby penguin had all voices; I notice that for the English version the only narrator is Morgan Freeman. The voices didn't anthropomorphize the penguins, but they ""telenovelized"" them, put them in a emotional frame which has nothing to do with them. The move was probably aimed at the viewers and I agree that one has to use a storyline to make the whole thing intelligible, but the things went more into the direction of a melodrama. The voices of the adult penguins fell embarrassingly silent when a big bird came and ate one of their young, the adults just watching and doing nothing, although they were bigger than the bird and could easily fight it away. It was obvious that they were clueless about what could be done, although minutes before they showed amazing skill in verbalizing their ""feelings"".Setting this aside, I think the movie is a beautiful and educational experience."
111,March of the Penguins,10,11 November 2005,Amazing!,"I was so spellbound by the beauty of the cinematography of this movie! From the first commercial I saw advertising the movie, I was excited about going, and I was not let down! I took my two children, aged 6 and 4, and they loved it as well! I laughed, I cried, I was truly blown away by the love and care that obviously went into capturing the mystery of this beloved creature. I was fortunate to see the American release, with Morgan Freeman narrating, and I thought he did a magnificent job. It was raw film-making at its best, with absolutely no ""Hollywood"" feel to it. The man who made this movie, and the crew that made this all possible are to be commended. Kudos!"
112,March of the Penguins,8,20 October 2005,Incredibly courageous documentary.,"....and I'm not talking about the penguins.Luc Jacquet beats all odds in what must have been one of the most difficult documentaries ever filmed, the journey of the penguins to the breeding grounds, a walk of some seventy miles, all done in single file and without any guideposts that we know of, just the instinct of survival, learned over millennia, that they had to go ever-inward on the tundra so that their eggs will not be lost in the great melting of the summer.Morgan Freeman does the voice-over narration, and it sometimes is a little over the top anthropomorphically speaking. No, they are not like us, Morgan, but perhaps we should become more like them. None of the penguin behaviour is selfish, rather the sacrifices made are all for the common good - the survival of the species, the only species who have made a life in the totally hostile environment that is Antartica and not made a run for it to Patagonia.The sight of all the fathers huddled together, foregoing their old conflicts with each other, keeping their eggs warm under their bellies and above their feet is an unforgettable sight. The storms they have to endure are caught rather frighteningly as one is aware at all times that the documentarians are there, with the penguins, filming the incredible.One feels one is right there as the brave march is made to the sea over and over knowing that the hunger of the penguins must be just about unbearable. But strike off again these mothers do, knowing only by instinct the chicks they have never seen (Dad hatches them) when they come back. Delicacy is preserved in any scene where the predators of the adult and baby penguins are successful. Perhaps this is for the youthful audience and the ratings. Sanitized for the children which gives it an oddly religious effect. The penguins themselves on their marches resemble nothing more than elderly monks in the manner of Friar Tuck.The word ""love"" is used a bit loosely here to describe the penguins' feelings (projection anyone?). Perhaps the human watchers of these extraordinary and selfless events can practice the principles of the penguins in their own lives, thus enhancing their own loving capabilities. 8 out of 10 from me, 9 out of 10 from the child in my life. Overall 8-1/2. Unforgettable."
113,March of the Penguins,10,15 October 2005,Highly Recommended,"We just got back from watching this movie tonight, and I must say WOW. It was fantastic.It was amazing to see our local theater full of people interested in a movie about penguins. But it is so much more than just that.Beautifully shot and touchingly told, I would recommend seeing this movie with a loved one. Your kids, your parents, siblings, friends.... we saw people of all types at the theater and at the end everyone was praising it.And I must note it was highly emotional.. yes, I cried! I had a lump in my throat most of the movie as it was just such an incredible story. Much kudos to the directors, and everyone who went through so much to share this movie with us!! Enjoy! PS; it's a short film, I would say forget the popcorn. Just sit down, cozy up and immerse yourself in the beauty of it!!"
114,March of the Penguins,10,13 October 2005,"A beautiful story, beautifully told...","I laughed. I cried. I became emotionally involved in the lives of the protagonists. The twists and turns, some expected, some not, held me on the edge of my chair. At times, I settled in, fascinated with the unfolding story. The story was of love, life and death. It is a story of survival against the greatest odds. There were significant differences between this tale and most other films. There were no actors. There was no script, other than the melodic and perfect narration by Morgan Freeman. But, there was, on the screen the most perfect honesty that a movie goer could want. When you can leave a theater and ask yourself the question ""what did I think of the movie,"" and the answer is ""wow,"" then, and only then, have you seen a marvelous film. It is truly a beautiful story, beautifully told."
115,March of the Penguins,7,3 October 2005,OK if you like this type of stuff,OK if you like this type of stuff. My wife hates the harsh parts of nature. I found the movie keeps the viewer interested. Show how nature goes through struggles for the survival of the breed. I wish they would show where the birds migrated from. Where they from South Africa or Argentina? I could not tell from the film. The photography and direction is excellent. Naration fits the movie too. The end credits show the birds interacting with the camera crew. I hate the cold portrayal in the film being from Winnipeg. I hate the wind. I just remembered from the film that the other hemispher has winter in June. A 7 out of 10. I can see 2 or 3a year of the nature PBS type of films.
116,March of the Penguins,10,27 September 2005,Brilliant,"This movie was absolutely outstanding! The filming, music and narration were all superb.As for the complaints about it being too anthropomorphic... well yes scientists can't prove penguins love each other, but can they prove people do? As for the complaints that it's too rugged for tiny tiny children. Yes life in Anarctica is tough, sorry but that fact can only be covered up so much.Morgan Feeman's voice is perfect. And you are left wondering what the film crew went through to capture the images.SEE THIS MOVIE. It deserves it's glowing reviews."
117,March of the Penguins,9,23 September 2005,Amazing film about a year in the life of a group of penguins is easily one of the years best,"A year with penguins at the South Pole. Nothing fancy, just ice, penguins and weather. Wow. This is easily one of the years best movies. It grabs you from the start and sucks you in. Amazing, hypnotic. Both breaks your heart and warms it.I saw the English or American version so I only say it with a Morgan Freeman narration. I can not imagine what this film is like in the original version with talking penguins. The thought of it boggles my mind since the film as a simple narrated documentary is beautiful and lyric. Why anyone would do anything else is beyond me. (perhaps when the DVD comes out I will get to hear what thats all about.) Amazing. See this movie. Its an incredible achievement. I look forward to the DVD so I can see it again, and so hopefully it will tell me how its done.(there are multi-disc versions in Europe and Asia so I'm hoping the US release is equally packed.)"
118,March of the Penguins,10,22 September 2005,"A beautiful, touching, yet heartbreaking and haunting film","This movie got to me. I had no idea this movie was going to pull me in so strongly on an emotional level. It provides such an intimate and compelling look at what these animals must go through for their very survival.One thing I wasn't prepared for was the element of death. There are many tragic moments where penguins die in various ways and I'm not sure if small children could handle the whole movie. Then again, maybe so. In any case, I will never, ever forget this great film. It is an instant classic and it ranks with the great nature documentaries of all time."
119,March of the Penguins,8,20 September 2005,Sacrifice,"When I first watched the penguins walked shakily on the slippery snow, I laughed a lot. As the documentary continued, I was moved deeply by their spirit. They gave up warm environment and took the risk of dying to colder place for producing their next generation. One of the impressive scenes was the following one. A penguin adjusted its position again and again in order to make sure that the egg got the biggest warmth.What the penguin did reminded me of human being. Any parent would like to sacrifice everything to guarantee that their children grow healthily. The process is hard and happy. In fact we share the same experience with the penguin.The amazing cinematography leads us into the amazing world of the penguin. The lively music makes the whole documentary more interesting.An excellent documentary you should not miss. 8/10"
120,March of the Penguins,10,10 September 2005,Unbelievable Must See!!!!!,"It is amazing to me how the intertwining connections between penguins could almost be compared to the capability of human beings. Without hesitation in a world of harsh encounters  the creation of love, devotion, sadness, sacrifices, brutality and triumph really brought on a new perspective. I have told everyone about this movie and swear if I could live among penguins  I would. :o) I have never been so moved by a concept. You find yourself almost embarrassed by an odd jealousy - for the purity and simplicity. It is wondrous, intriguing, heartwarming and overall  a great educational film. Not just for discovery but for life lessons as we know them."
121,March of the Penguins,8,9 September 2005,Must see for nature lovers or anybody who wonders about life,"A beautiful movie, comparable with 'Winged Migration"", another French production that is a delight to watch. The mannerism of the penguins is intriguing. It is hard to believe that a species exists under such dare circumstances. That they can wink an eyelid in sixty degrees below and just stand there for months doing not much else than rotating from the outside to the inside of the group to find protection against the harsh climate. When in a long line-up, they look like monks of some sort in a medieval scene. Their walking, falling, and standing up, is much like humans and very funny to watch. Until the end, when running the credits you have no idea as how big (or small) these penguins are. A bit long, too 'Disney"" like and too predictable narration. But the look into the wonderful life of these penguins is astonishing."
122,March of the Penguins,10,6 September 2005,Which is the greater achievement?,"I never would have guessed that National Geographic would have the sleeper hit of the summer, but here it is, March of the Penguins, a film that dazzles the eye and touches the heart even as it delights the mind. It is a small story that nevertheless achieves epic heights of film-making and makes stars of its subjects the way Madagascar never dreamed of.Essentially, the film focuses on the annual trek of the Emperor Penguins of Australia from the sea to their breeding grounds seventy miles inland where the ice never melts and they can safely nurture their offspring through the first treacherous months of life. While the males sit on the sole egg that their mate has entrusted to them, the exhausted females return to the sea to feed and bring nourishment back to their soon-to-hatch young.As enthralling as I found the annual trek of the Emperor Penguins, I can't help feeling guilty that I spent the bulk of the film wondering how these filmmakers got some of the incredible shots they showed us. At one point, the camera rises off the ground and soars far above a huddled mass of penguins; surely they didn't drag a crane to Antarctica, and wouldn't a helicopter have frightened their subject? I was rescued from my mental anguish by the closing credits which revealed that the filmmakers had made spectacular use of a balloon.But those penguins really are something else. Huddling together for warmth, what do the males think about for those cold, dark weeks while the females gather food for their offspring? Is protecting the egg enough for them to get by on? I suppose so. Perhaps such a thought is forcing too much human emotion on to these creatures, but the film encourages us to personify the penguins, to pick out the meaning in their calls and wails, and to sympathize with their struggles and losses.March of the Penguins smartly skirts the issues that might have made it more controversial; global warming goes unmentioned, and evolution is summed up by stating that these birds ""chose"" to remain in Antarctica when it started to get cold. Yes, but did they choose to grow a flap of skin to insulate their egg, and for their wings to become flipper-like, or did something choose that for them? To address that question would have been a tragic mistake for a film that's purpose is to enchant, enthrall, and, yes, even inform."
123,March of the Penguins,10,29 August 2005,The anthropomorphic nature of the birds allows us to connect more with the them,"There is a segment in Jean Baudrillard theory of hyper reality which talks about the state of our culture, specifically how we are degrading our society by giving way to mechanized culture, Baudrillard states that we will eventually destroy true reality and replace it with machines that simulate what was once there naturally; it should come as no surprise that Baudrillard was a major influence on the Wachowski Brothers movie The Matrix. Scott Adams ""Delbert"" put it another way ""we live in a cold mechanistic technocracy; we have to make that work"". After viewing March of the Penguins one is presented with the paradox of the film industry and scientific and technological advances in general, as we watch these birds on there amazing journey one realizes that with out or technological advances we would not be able to share this experience with the animals, whilst at the same time we should realize that it is our machines and our supposed need for expansion that are destroy the natural environment in the first place. As Ian Malcolm put it in Jurassic Park, ""Science is so concerned with weather or not the can that they never stop to think about if they should."" the state of wonderment one finds themselves in while watching the birth of a baby bird in an environment such as Antarctica makes one well aware how far removed society has come from nature, to say that I watched a baby penguin move about in such a realistic fashion that I question its reality by stating that it looks almost animatronics; it says a lot about the state of our civilization when one can view the birth of an infant penguin, watch as he is nurtured on screen and whilst amazed at of what is happening question its realism, that fact, to me, shows how far removed our civilization has become from nature.March of the Penguins has now grossed over well over its 8-million dollar budget, and to my knowledge is one of the most successful wildlife documentaries in recent years, I have a theory about why this is. As we already know penguins and there amazing journey are the centerpiece for this documentary, and penguins are, unlike many other animals such as the birds we find in Winged Migration or the insects we view in Microcosmos, are naturally easier for humans to embed with anthropomorphic qualities. Thus, when once views March of the Penguins we feel a more dramatic connection with the animals journeys because we have infused within them humanistic characteristics. This is exemplified within the film itself, which makes no effort to show humans interacting in any way with the animals, while also using camera placements which make the animals look larger and more Human size then they really are (watch the end credits to get a sense of perspective of the relative size of the animals vs. the filmmakers). The other exemplification is within the films advertising campaign, which uses the tagline ""a story about love"". The educated viewer will realize that unlike the human concept of love animals act purely on instinct and inherited traits, thus the marketing campaign is embedding within the animals natural insects the human concept of love.Like Microcosmos and Winged Migration, Mach of the Penguins follows a tradition I have noticed in French wildlife documentaries, which is one of being more poetic in the presentation of its images than overly educational. However, I did come away with more detailed information, then when viewing either of the former two films, just don't expect the same depth of knowledge one would get from a David Attenborough documentary and you will enjoy yourself"
124,March of the Penguins,8,1 September 2005,French versus American versions,"I have seen La Marche de l'Empereur in both French and American versions. They both have the same sequences, but I felt like the music from the French version made it feel more like a movie, whereas the classical music in the American version made it feel like more of a documentary. For some reason the French version felt more magical, and it gave me the tingles when I watched it. When this comes out on DVD I would strongly encourage people to watch it in the original French version with subtitles. There are so many differences between the two versions in their narrative that it almost seemed like a different movie. I enjoyed both versions, don't get me wrong, I just preferred the French one, and I would recommend it to people over the American version.Also, if my French didn't fail me when I watched it originally, then it seems like they changed the narrative in at least one part to possibly better suit American audiences, which I thought was a little disappointing."
125,March of the Penguins,10,28 August 2005,It still looked like Pittsburgh in the winter!,"March of the Penguins is an amazing movie. Right after the opening credits ran, I was immediately thinking of how the film crews survived this and who in their right mind would film this? Good thing my questions were answered at this movie's end, or I would be right here looking that kind of stuff up.Penguins are quite the hybrid bird (Aptenodytes forsteri). I can see why the Pittsburgh hockey team incorporated them as their mascot, because Emperor Penguins are tough as nails and as far as I can remember their winters are virtually identical.Puns aside, your journey begins and ends with ice, nothing but pure unadulterated ice, enough ice to make Tanqueray's Tony Sinclair choke on a lime. These harsh conditions lend to the drama, as Pluto-like winters pound this magnificent society mercilessly leaving their unborn, unknowing, or unwilling casualties to end up as simple elements of the subfreezing landscape. March of the Penguins captures the hell succinctly, and never really belabors the obvious that survival on this planet is a tremendous undertaking. You find a renewed respect for this planet through this film and I deeply appreciated the wake up call."
126,March of the Penguins,10,27 August 2005,We could learn a thing or two from penguins,"Today, the human world is strongly divided along lines of race, religion, gender, nationality and ideology. And to add to all of this, we in America also choose to divide ourselves based on some fairly arbitrary stuff: Democrat or Republican; city or suburbs; sub-compact or SUV; smoking or non-smoking; Yankees or Red Sox. In this atmosphere, it is no wonder that divorce rates are increasing and people are feeling increasingly isolated from each other.Recently, I saw ""March of the Penguins"", a wonderful documentary about the mating and child-rearing habits of emperor penguins and saw how these fascinating creatures have survived only due to love, cooperation, and a sense of community.The movie shows how once a year, the entire adult population of emperor penguins converges on a single piece of land in the most inhospitable place on earth. Once there, they choose partners and take the next eight months to mate and raise their chicks. The title refers not only to the fact that the penguins waddle single file 70 miles inland to mate, but that mating season begins in March. The only way that any species can survive in that place is if they all huddle together and there is a system in place so that the chicks will not go unprotected while the parents look for food. As a result, there are strong familial bonds between the father, mother, and chick. Also, there is an elaborate set of group behavior that helps ensure that the risk to individual penguins, eggs and chicks is minimized.Of course, the system is not perfect. Older penguins still die from the cold, inexperienced parents let their eggs die, and even with all the precautions they take, they are not immune from the seals and albatrosses that prey on them.However, the sense of love and community that these creatures show for one another is heartwarming to watch, and the camera work by Luc Jacquet and narration from Morgan Freeman (going back into his ""Electric Company"" mode) turn what could have been just another nature documentary into something uplifting and extraordinary. 10 out of 10."
127,March of the Penguins,10,21 August 2005,"Wonderful, but Sad (Spoilers!)","My sister, mother, and I went to see this movie not too long ago. My sister loves penguins and I love seeing the little babies waddle around and look cute.I loved it, even though it was very sad. The various ways that the babies died made me cry as did the lone penguin and the bereaved parents. I still loved it because I learned something new about an animal that isn't talked about a lot in a format that didn't make me want to fall asleep. The cinematography and the visuals are dazzling. I laughed, I cried, I sat stunned. No fart jokes, no sexual scenes, no hot stars. Just good, solid movie. Money well spent, IMO."
128,March of the Penguins,10,20 August 2005,"Using Penguins to Celebrate Life, and Succeeding!","Parents, if you plan on taking your kids to this film, be prepared for the possibility of a talk afterward. A talk about the ways of life, death, and nature. And incredible movies.""March of the Penguins"" is simply amazing. The movie shines not only as a documentary but also through its personification of the subject matter: Penguins! And their trek from the oceans to their breeding grounds on the frozen abyss of Antarctica.The camera-work is solid, and the choice of Morgan Freeman as narrator is wise. His voice adds an element of comfort through scenes of survival against ridiculous odds. Most importantly, this documentary does not focus solely on the narrator or the camera, but effectively balances spoken word with majestic photography to captivate the audience throughout the film. The musical score is strong as well.The footage of the penguins themselves evokes the normal responses one might expect. Many a time an audience member could be heard saying ""Awwww..."" or ""Wow, they're so cute!"" As much happiness as these images evoked, still as effective was Jacquet's attention to the survival side of the penguins' journey. All of the dangers are presented: old age, falcons (or maybe vultures, I couldn't figure out what type of bird it was), seals, even exposing the egg to the cold, all of the different ways nature acts to control penguin populations are documented. The conflicting forces give the film a strong tension, helping us root for the penguins to overcome their trials.The personification of the penguins, though, might be the most memorable parts of the movie. Scenes of female penguins fighting over male penguins, penguins bickering and remaining faithful to their mates, father and mother penguins teaching their child the sound of their call, to the penguins understanding and coping with the death of their chicks (including a scene where one female penguin attempts to steal another chick after losing her own) allow the penguins to almost become human. The concept of sacrifice for the good of the children is undeniably powerful: Both mother and father go for months without food, the father even doing most of the incubating. The lengths the parents go for the children strikes a strong chord.In the end, a wonderful film. But if your children are curious and impressionable, be ready for that talk. About life, death, nature, and why doing things in the name of love and family are some of the greatest things in the world."
129,March of the Penguins,8,19 August 2005,"Excellent, thought-provoking","This beautifully made film is one of the best I have seen in years. While movie experiences lately revolve around teen horror, urban violence, and trashy sexual situations, it's a welcome diversion to see what another species goes through just to survive, and it can make a human feel like the laziest, most spoiled life form on earth! The penguins struggle so much and each of their lives is precious to them, and they truly are a loving collective that rely on each other to endure horrid environmental conditions. The stateside version of the movie is apparently better than some, as the narration by Morgan Freeman is perfect and there are no awkward musical or vocal distractions. Most amazing is how this film makes the audience reflect on human habits of life and procreation. While some will criticize that penguins are acting more on instinct than ""love"" when it comes to their chicks, this relates exactly to humans, who only reproduce out of a biological imperative to spread their DNA, and love is a by-product of that rather than the purpose. So humans will deride that fact while unknowingly replicating it, as proved by the overwhelming preference of humans to have ""their OWN"" offspring rather than adopt a less fortunate one abandoned by someone else. This is especially embarrassing in light of how easy it is to survive as a human and what a surplus of food and resources we have, while the penguins struggle by the day just to provide enough food for a single baby, and would never think of abusing, neglecting, or abandoning it unless their own lives were at stake. It is so poignant to see how one penguin in the film reacts to the loss of her chick, and should make people reconsider their affirmations that human love is superior, or even different in the least, from what penguins experience. Overall, this was an excellent and moving experience that was enjoyed by everyone at the screening I attended. There are even some funny moments, and the baby penguins really stole the show with their fuzzy, waddling cuteness. Too, it was realistic without being traumatic, as the G-rating is strictly adhered to and there is no blood or serious brutality (it is a lot less violent than your average nature documentary on TV). This is a good thing, since the film is gritty enough due to the environmental factors, and would certainly evoke excessive tears if it were too gory or morbid.This is definitely one of the best films you'll see all year. Take the kids, and hopefully reflect a bit more on how many orphans there are in our over-stuffed, over-sexed society. The message is what a better society it would be if only people could be more like penguins..."
130,March of the Penguins,8,18 August 2005,Good Documentary,"My wife, my daughter and I went to see it. I think between the three of us, we represent how a good chunk of how people will appreciate the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but thought of ways it could have been improved. My 6 year old daughter liked it okay, asking me questions throughout the whole thing, but I could tell that she was getting bored in parts. My wife said it was okay, but made the comment, ""It's like when we're watching T.V. and you have the remote, but I can't get up and leave the room.""As a documentary, it was good. This one was more artistic, and less educational, than what I would prefer, but that's probably because this one was intended for movie theatres. I imagine that when it's finally shown on T.V., the first airing of course will show it in its entirety, but 5 years from now they'll have it trimmed down to fit into an hour-long time slot. And I don't think it will be any the worse for being half an hour shorter. Howver, if you enjoy nature and documentaries, this movie's worth seeing on the big screen, especially for some of the views and camera shots."
131,March of the Penguins,10,17 August 2005,Not a public school educational movie.,"If you think this is just a bunch of penguins walking and fishing and eating and running around while a narrator tells in a monotone voice why and what they're doing, I would say no.I actually didn't want to see this movie. But my friend saw it and liked it, and made me see it, to. I was expecting a boring discovery channel/natural geographic documentary, the kind they show in schools, but this really is something different. It may seem silly, but it made me see penguins as human beings, just miniature ones. The music wasn't so great, the story was the extremely boring, the photos were pretty, but not the greatest, and yet, Jacquet somehow managed to show the emotion in the foreign world of penguins.If you think this is just a documentary, I would say no. But this is a pretty good french documentary."
132,March of the Penguins,10,17 August 2005,Rewarding to watch,"I saw this on the plane over to London and despite the small screens it still managed to blow me away. This beautifully crafted film was engaging to watch, enticing the mind into deep thought. It's both educational and entertaining and its in-depth look into the life of the emperor penguin leaves you in awe of just how impressive and noble these creatures are. It takes us into a remote part of the world that is so abstract and foreign, and so harsh and inhospitable, that the will to exist is a constant battle.Technically the film was impressive, including the score, earning creative points for its different approach. But perhaps the vocals could have been re-worked, or subdued, or abandoned altogether. The technique of narration (French version with English subtitles)was original but not altogether completely effective. Although it made it easier to depict which was which sex, I learnt later that there is another version with Morgan Freeman narrating, which I think will probably be better for me personally, firstly because I think he's great, and secondly because I don't think there needs to be a voice over of a child to make a penguin chick cuter than it already is. Overall on a technical scale, I was most impressed by the visual imagery of sweeping landscapes of vast whiteness disappearing into eternity, never-ending expanses of glistening walls of ice, underwater shots of hungry penguins feeding on shoals of fish, and wide angle shots of masses upon masses of penguins huddled or migrating single file.The film definitely had an endearing quality and an unspoken power of being able to engage the viewer (perhaps through the use of humour). But sometimes it proved quite difficult to watch, for various reasons, but mostly through the blatant message that those who aren't strong enough, don't just die, but are forgotten. The long arduous wait for their final peril, can be a hard blow, and it can leave one with a sense of quiet sadness and mourning for something that was so honourable and deserving. But as life goes on, so does the film and we get to see that it was all worth it in the end. The film teaches us that despite all odds in this remote part of the world, with its harsh and inhospitable climate, its ever-changing face, and lack of congeniality, life can still exist."
133,March of the Penguins,10,16 August 2005,Excellent Documentary of Life and Love In The Antarctic !!!,"If you think life is tough in Suburbia try being a Penguin for a season !!!Luc Jaquet looks at a year of life in the Antarctic ,always in the negative temperatures, for whatever little of warmth there is, and finds the circle of life with the Emperor Penquins, their travels, trials, hardships and Triumphs !!!Highly complimentary music score by Alex Wurman , U.S. Version. Wonderfully documented(Luc Jacquet) and photographed (Laurent Chalet,Jerome Maison) and narrated U.S. Version(Morgan Freeman) this is a testament to life itself,(What was God thinking), as the Emperor Penguin seeks to perpetuate his life . After spending 3 months on vacation, the tribes decide it is time to meet up. Traveling long distances up to 70 miles !!!The trials of the Emperor penguin literally begin in March, as the tribes meet up , as if by Magic, in a predetermined area, where the ice is thickest, to begin their ritual of selecting , cooing, and mating !!! After mating,the female delivers her egg, and hopefully and with skill, transfer the egg to the male, where the role reversal takes place.Without the layers of body fat attained during the playful months, the species could not survive the winter without a food supply !!!The male must then endure the unrealistically harsh winter, where temperatures of 60 below with 100 mile an hour winds !!! The female then reverts to the sea, to replenish her body fat, which has decreased by up to 50%. She will return to feed her newborn. Jacquet's loving direction provides both the highs and the lows of life, without beating you with cruelty of nature, that can be viewed by both adult and child !!! There is even footage under the ice, INCREDIBLE !!! If you have never been to the Antarctic, or if you ever wanted to know what Penguins do , or for the curious of life itself, then see this quintessential look of love of life, maybe the reflection you see, will not be the one you expected ?About an hour and a half running time, maybe one of the greatest documentaries of all time !!! STAY FOR THE CREDITS !!!Truly , one of the most BEAUTIFUL and Touching Documentaries you will ever see!!!Look for the shape of a Heart, when the Penguins are bonding !!! Academy Award Worthy, sure to be Nominated !!!"
134,March of the Penguins,9,15 August 2005,not necessarily for younger children,"beautifully shot, wonderfully narrated, funny and touching. i loved this movie, but was surprised that there was no warning whatsoever that dead baby penguins were shown. be careful taking young or easily upset children to see this movie. some of the themes explored are uncomfortable and include death, child abandonment, and kidnapping. be prepared to answer uncomfortable questions. otherwise, though, this movie is a lot of fun. i, a full grown woman who attended this movie without children, laughed aloud at the silly waddling and giggled at how cute the babies were. i was touched at the loving tenderness and sensuality with which the mama and daddy penguins nuzzled each other. on the whole, this was a great movie, definitely the best thing i've seen all summer!"
135,March of the Penguins,6,14 August 2005,Outstanding view of the world of the penguin,"This movie was very well done, and did a good job of giving the viewer an insight into the world of the penguins. It is amazing how strong the drive to reproduce is in these creatures, and what they have to go through as they spend months hatching and taking care of their little ones. Anybody who is a parent will especially appreciate how much of a bond develops between the penguins as mates and also with their chicks. I realize birds probably do most of what they do by instinct, but there is that undeniable identification with the experience of being a parent which transcends species. I recommend this film, especially if you are a lover of animals. Also, stay through the closing credits, as you will see the extraordinary lengths that the filmmakers went through to capture these scenes in a very hostile environment."
136,March of the Penguins,10,14 August 2005,It is a movie that tells us about the strength of community and sacrifice,"When I got to hear about the movie I thought it was perhaps a story of how Penguins migrate from one place to another. I was moved to see it was about incredible experience of 'order', community, fidelity, and sacrifice especially for the weak. It was incredible to see a great sense of 'family' and cooperation to survive the vicissitudes of their 'world'. Could one imagine how the penguins change turns as they try to protect one another over the turbulent winter wind storms. They change turns from middle warmer positions to the outside walls they formed to protect themselves from the harshest weather. I think we, humans, will probably refuse to leave the middle warmer position as soon as we arrive there!! I could see the penguins go without meals for months just to ensure the safety of their egg and the young. I imagined so many theories we have tried to force unto our culture today - culture of death - just to have our conveniences.But penguins have also a sense of justice born out of community life - I refer to the situation where the mother penguins who have lost their young would want to take the young of the other mothers. The others (community) would not allow that, as the narrator, Morgan Freeman, tells us.I rated this film ten because I thought it had a lot to teach us about being human!!! Can we learn from the penguins?"
137,March of the Penguins,7,11 August 2005,A mix of cuddly penguins with Morgan Freeman's voice over narration just has to be good.,"*** Narration by Morgan Freeman. Directed by Luc Jacquet. A fantastic visual look at the emperor penguins journey to save them from extinction. Luc Jacquet directs this documentary about the penguins struggle in the harsh Antartic winds and the sleet of snow storms that affect the penguins in their mating season. Although the movie really can't go anywhere except for Antartica still the movie is a great documentary and a barrier breaker for penguins, showing the harsh reality instead of some cute, cuddly fantasy world in most of the penguin movies. The best documentary I've seen since Fahrenhiet 9/11. My final rating 7/10."
138,March of the Penguins,9,8 August 2005,No one will be disappointed.,"At it's core, it is a fantastically made IMAX or really nicely done National Geographic film. But it goes beyond that, with terrific film footage of a place none of us are going visit. The film does what film should, it tells an original story in a compelling, thoughtful way. It may not shatter the box office or receive the highest of praise, but no one, and I mean no one, of any normal heart and mind will walk out and feel that they didn't see a decent movie. Unlike so many of the movies that are rehashed, redone formulas and dug up old TV shows and remakes, it is fresh and original. It has a ideal pace for its format. Every kid in the audience was on the edge of their seats. I wouldn't call it a feel good movie, just a good feeling movie. Highly recommend for families, and anyone who would like to see a film without sex, cursing, violence or a car chase."
139,March of the Penguins,9,7 August 2005,A great movie,"March of the Penguins is an incredible movie covering a year in the life of emperor penguins. It begins with penguins surfacing from their home in the sea to find a mate. The movie covers this mating process from conception to when the baby penguins are left on their own. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, we see the hardships the penguins have to face for reproduction. Sometimes either the male, the female,or the new baby will die due to the weather or predators. The risk the penguins have to take is often more compelling than some other movies I have seen this year. If you want to see something different late in the summer (I know I have), then this is the movie for you. This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year."
140,March of the Penguins,9,6 August 2005,Burrrrrr!,"This is a movie to see if you want to get cold. I live in Arizona, and it was 110 the day I went to see it. I am not kidding when I say that I felt a little cold. I heard that theaters are turning the temperature down 10 degrees to add a more real effect. It worked. I had no idea that Penguins froze to death. There were many things I didn't know about PENGUINS I was amazed that they are so family oriented. Tedd should see this. It's probably too devoid of action for Jake. But I still think he should see it. He lives in Las Vegas and eats meals.I want to make it very clear that this movie does show some very horrible scenes in which mother nature's predatory thing kicks into action. I know, it's hard. OK, time for me to go to the gym."
141,March of the Penguins,10,1 August 2005,wonderful,"Best movie of the year thus far. March of the Penguins seems to be your typical documentary, with beautiful shots of landscape and the prerequisite close up shots of our waddling Antartican friends. No, this ""documentary"" tugs at your heart with the truth that is presented on screen. Watching everything that the Emperor penguin goes thru to perpetuate their species puts the whole world into perspective. I will see this movie again and again and will be the first to purchase the DVD when it comes out (whenever that will be). You owe it to yourself to give this movie a chance. It's great for all ages. you'll laugh and cry and gasp and sigh."
142,March of the Penguins,8,31 July 2005,"It's about penguins, what do you think I think?","If March of the Penguins is told in a rather conventional manner for a documentary, I'm willing to forgive it because the story behind it is so compelling. When you have a story this unusual and interesting, you can't be slowed down by things like presentation and layout. You can't make up the things that happen to these emperor penguins. As much as I hate to spread a cliché, truth is stranger than fiction in this case.The emperor penguin's sole purpose, it may seem, in life is to give birth so that their kind may live for another generation. To do this, they must travel to get to a breeding ground thick enough to support them when the ice melts in spring. Before they reach this safe ground, they will have traveled over seventy miles. Keep in mind that they do not travel this distance by air (as they are a flightless bird) or by sea- but on foot. When they have arrived, the thousands of penguins pair up and begin to mate. Sometimes it seems that something as simple as another penguin's call is enough, but it is most likely their method of selecting a suitable partner is based on a criteria we cannot possibly understand.Once the penguins have given birth, ownership of the egg is switched from the female to the male. This reversal of gender roles in the natural kingdom is not unique to penguins (if I remember correctly, the male sea horse is the one who actually gives birth), but it is interesting nonetheless. So as the male penguins brave blizzards that can be up to 150 degrees below zero while holding the egg under a flap of skin, the females walk back to the sea to collect food for themselves, and more importantly for their baby. As we are told, the penguins who do not return actually result in two casualties: the mother penguin and that of her newborn chick.Like the chicks who are eventually forced to swim without ever having seen the sea before, their journey to the breeding ground is an instinctual feeling, an evolutionary process so oft-repeated by their ancestors that it has been drilled into their head. The fact that these penguins are traveling over seventy miles on foot is extraordinary enough, but that they are doing so on an instinct, to a destination they have never known, is simply astounding. Try to put this in human. Many of us cannot even get to the pizza place without Mapquest in tow. How could we possibly navigate miles of Antartica land and find a small area on a feeling? If there's any one problem with the film, it's that Morgan Freeman's narration and even the soundtrack serve to further the film's tendency of emotionalism over logic. There's a scene in particular I'm thinking about, right after the female penguins feed for the first time since the march's start. As the music swells with sinister tones, we are reminded about a predatory sea lion scouring the sea floor in search of (and finds) a penguin to make its next meal. My problem with this scene is that it seems to almost look down on the sea lion. Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly rooting for the emperor penguin's extended survival, but isn't the sea lion just following nature's way as well? No, the idea that hundreds of these noble creatures will not make it back is not a happy one. But as anyone familiar with Darwin's idea of natural selection will tell you, it is for the best. That's the thing about Mother Nature: she can make something as awe-inspiring as this, but she can just as quickly take it away.And although the film does end with a sense of closure, in reality they will back again next year, and the year after that. I knew that emperor penguins mate every year, but I had always thought that penguins spent most of the year swimming, feasting, and generally acting like the polar bears from the Coca-Cola commercials and set aside one season of the year to mate. In other words, the total opposite. At any rate, this is a fine documentary about one of nature's most intriguing happenings."
143,March of the Penguins,9,31 July 2005,Beautiful cinematography,"Luc Jacquet impressively captures the beauty of the harsh climate of Antarctica. The main characters of this film are endearing not only for their stunning plumage, but also for their fortitude and dogged determination to survive in a world of adversity.This film shows impossible landscapes untread by humans- ridges, peaks and steep faces of massive glaciers that would be the envy of any seasoned mountaineer. What is a freezing and totally inaccessible world to us is home to the Emperor Penguin. This movie is a fascinating account documenting the cycles of life of this inimitable star. The lives of a colony of penguins is a story of survival that is moving, sad at times and always interesting.While this film is extremely educational it would have been nice to have had more information presented to the viewer such as a map and other statistics. The idea that this movie is a ""story of love"" anthropomorphizes the penguins and makes the viewer feel a connection to them. I hope that other movies like this come out so that more effort will be made to conserving the habitat of the animals of the world."
144,March of the Penguins,9,30 July 2005,See it on the big screen!,"This is an amazingly beautiful and moving documentary. The stark Antarctic landscape is beautifully photographed as are the penguins. The score is lovely, too, and Morgan Freeman's narration sets the right tone. This doc clearly moved my audience, which was primarily older but sprinkled with a few young families. One child was heard crying as s/he reacted to death of a young chick. I wiped away a tear as well. My only ""complaint"" is that some very interesting material that was more behind the scenes was only shown over the closing credits. Many people in the audience who were filing out as the credits started to role actually stopped and held up the line in order to watch this part. I'll definitely want to check out the DVD to see some more of how this film was made. This is one film that should, if possible, be seen on the large screen. The setting and photography are too spectacular for a regular-sized TV in my opinion."
145,March of the Penguins,9,30 July 2005,It really IS a love story,"This is one of those rare films that truly takes your breath away. Sure, it may be about the life cycle of penguins, but even the toughest critic will see parallels in our own lives and be touched by the eternal struggles involved in raising and protecting a family. The script provides for a thoughtful and sympathetic narration from Morgan Freeman, whose voice is perfect for the range of emotion and drama you will sense when watching what these critters must endure to survive at the South Pole. This is great family entertainment (the G rating ensures that) and a must-see on the big screen this year. You won't soon forget it."
146,March of the Penguins,9,29 July 2005,Beautifully Filmed and Educational Film,"March of the Penguins (Marche de l'empereur, La) is a beautifully filmed, narrated, and overall very educational film. March of the Penguins follows the mating rituals of Emperor Penguins. I've always been captivated by the little, bird like creatures called Penguins but I wasn't to keen on seeing this film.The film covers from before the penguins make a 70+ mile march across Antartica to there mating grounds, to the bitter cold they must endure, and all the way to the loss of young at the hands of mother nature.The film is a bit emotional when presented with the daunting task of the males facing the -40 degree wind and the loss of young. The film is accompanied by Morgan Freemans powerful yet comforting voice and a beautiful soundtrack that fits right in with the cute but powerful penguins.Above all other things the cinematography that is used is incredible. The shots of Antartica's frigid terrain and frozen mountains are stunning and beautiful. But the most beautiful pictures are those of the magnificent creatures presented in the film. The film makers are able to bring forth the struggles and the emotional sides of penguins. I was able to take everything in easily and it is presented very well and easy to understand.I thought the film was cute, it's funny, and it's very educational. Morgan Freeman is only in the US version if I understand correctly but is able to keep you into the film and understand it. I hope you enjoy this film, it's a fantastic film.March of the Penguins (Marche de l'empereur, La. Narrarated by Morgan Freeman.4 1/2 out 5 Stars."
147,March of the Penguins,10,21 July 2005,"Phenomenal, even after multiple viewings","(This is a comment on the US version.)I greatly enjoyed March of the Penguins, and not just because I'm a huge fan of the birds. I'm also a huge fan of Morgan Freeman, and his smooth (near-hypnotic) voice-over matched the pacing of the film wonderfully. I won't add a review of the movie per se (you can judge from the comments of others), but I'd like to comment on the audiences. I'm afraid that, normally, respectful audiences are in short supply in my town. However, the folks lining up to see this movie have been well-mannered and quiet, even the little ones. This must truly be a family film: I've seen three generations in some groups! Round up the whole family, you're not going to see something like this in the theaters for a long time to come."
148,March of the Penguins,9,18 July 2005,Penguins march single file  to their ancient mating grounds and raise their young.,"La Marche de l'Empereurwent to the march of the penguins recently; it was the single most enjoyable! evening in the cinema I've experienced in years!it is immensely real, natural, genuine, honest, frank, and moving; one sees the human condition mirrored in this wonderful documentary over 12 months of the trials and tribulations of the endlessly fascinating emperor penguinsI was so moved to see how they gather after they're 5 yrs old and select a mate to whom they remain loyal for 1 year; they mate (beautifully portrayed, poetical and lovely) and await the egg!it comes (or not) and those lucky enough to have a viable one, engages in a FASCINATING AND INSPIRING post coital cooperation all aimed at ensuring the safety and life of the eggthe female initially takes it after its arrival into a warm fold in her body, covered by fur, to keep it warm; she props it up on her feet to keep it from contact with the ice (in temps of -68 degrees Fahrenheit w/ 100+mph winds!)once the egg is secured, the females group together into thick groups to protect against the cold; the male then has to repeat the prior 70 MILE! trek from the ocean over the ice to find their feeding area in the ocean; they jump in and feed (and are eaten by seals) on krill, jellyfish and gorge themselves! it is revealed later that they retain a little bit of emergency food in secret pouches in their esophagi!the females by this time have been freezing, dying, eggs dropped freeze on the spot and crack, females mourning pathetically and heartbreakingly over them.they try to break up snow (rare; it's too cold for snow) for drinking water.they STAND THERE for MONTHS, huddled masses, yearning for their mates to return w/ sustenance. when the males return after the 70 mile trek (1 step at a time, in a British style disciplined queue) over months, the 2 sexes see each other and it's PARTY TIME! the penguins wax ecstatic, and it's the most sensationally enjoyable moment in the film; the audience laughs and applauds.wonderful!Then, the couple (monogamous for 1 yr only!) engage in a beautiful rehearsal/practice sequence à la a quarterback and his center in spring training learning each other's moves in getting the football from the center to the qb, knowing that the transfer to come will determine the next step in the perilous process that may insure the survival of the baby penguin; the stakes are very high, and they practice intensively.finally, when they determine it's meet, they go into the rotations and gyrations they have worked on for so long and pass the egg from the female to the male, who, if fortunate, can balance it on his feet and surround it with HIS enveloping opening covered with fur for warmth. then it becomes even more exciting!the males who have been successful in receiving the only egg group together in the familiar cold-avoidance huddle, very tightly packed, with those on the periphery allowed entrance into the warmest part of the center on a schedule determined by the penguins themselves; they rotate in and out, and the males STAND THERE FOR FOUR MONTHS OR MORE through the blizzards and harshest parts of arctic storms, without any food! they protect the egg at all costs. finally, the egg hatches, and the chick comes out; some freeze, and some survive and are protected in the male's pouch awaiting the mother's return w/ a belly full of nourishment; close to starvation, the infants cry and finally the male summons up the secret cache of nourishment in his gullet and feeds them a modicum of sustenance, just enough to keep the babies alive. this goes on for months w/ no food for dad.FINALLY, the female returns w/ a belly full of goodies; she walks around and listens for the sound of her mate; he cries out and listens for her; if all goes well, they meet up and she sees her baby for the first time! it's so beautiful, the tears stream down the cheeks of all but the most insensate movie goers; I teared up MANY times during this movie, I'm not ashamed to admit.the females who suffer a frozen chick are INCONSOLABLE IN GRIEF and wither and die! It's heartbreaking; mother nature is HARSHthe chicks are then passed on from the male to the female into the protective flesh/feather cave and it's time for the males to do the 70 mile trek for food; they are motivated by the fact that THEY HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING FOR FOUR MONTHS!they leave on the 70 mile trek again and gorge themselves; they return to grown or frozen chicks, and the feeding frenzy continues. The scene showing the overstuffed chicks, comically bloated with the feeding, leaves the audience laughing heartedly.finally, the mature males and females depart and leave the fuzzy babies alone to fend for themselves; some try to follow mom and dad, but they are rebuffed and abandoned. The relationship between male/female is now over! no recriminations, no dissolutions, no lawyers, no courtrooms; they just split and jump into the ocean in search of tomorrow! the babies watch this and ask themselves, ""what do we do now?"" This is enunciated in that rare dialect of the polar region known as penguinese emperioso. The teeny boppers decide that instead of slamming the local Arctic Mall, they will brave the waters of the ocean and, with great and wonderful irony, ""return to their home for the first time!"" In five years they will begin courting in March and march into the cycle....you know the restI can't recommend this film any more highly!It made this grown man thrill, wonder, and weep!® Norman Craig Wheaton 2005"
149,March of the Penguins,10,18 July 2005,A more than excellent film,"I know people who have been to that godforsaken place. Think of the yards (forget feet) of film that were shot to make what is a great film with great editing. I ask folks were are going to go see it, if they cried when they saw Bambi? If so, take a box of Kleenex. Very frank story that shows that some of nature's stories are simply amazing!!! I would bet a film on how the film was shot would be just as amazing! I've shot underwater in 36 degree water, but I felt warm, but -80 just goes beyond the range of expectation! I would like to know a little more statistical information (or a source for it) on the impact of the penguin's predators. I encourage everyone to get everyone they know to go watch this film!"
150,March of the Penguins,9,18 July 2005,"Imagine, a hit documentary that isn't a political polemic...","Originally shot as a french documentary titled La Marche de l'empereur (it has made over $12 million in France), the film dropped it's original narration from the penguins point of view, added the soothing narration of Morgan Freeman and a new score, and released it Stateside. For the past few weeks, with limited release, the film has been the biggest grossing film on a per screen basis in America. It is the hot documentary of the year, and it didn't have to attack the government or a major corporation to do it (it's made an estimated $3.9 million in North America thus far).Instead of political intrigue, National Geographic's film, directed by Luc Jacquet, focuses on the incredible journey undertaken by the Emperor Penguin every March in Antarctica, where they travel some 70 miles in the harsh winter to breed. It's a stunning portrayal of the brutal struggle they face in the most severe weather on earth, and a stark reminder of the adaptability of nature.The tag line for the film is ""In the harshest place on Earth, love finds a way"", and the film does an excellent job in portraying both the harshness of their trials and the startling lengths they'll go through, if not for love (which is a little anthropomorphic for my liking), then for the over-powering desire to fulfill their genetic destiny. They travel 70 miles into the continent to find a bit of cover from the brutal winds and temperatures (reaching -80 degrees at points), and solid ice that will prevent their offspring from falling into the ocean beneath them. Not all of the penguins will survive this journey, nor the subsequent journeys back to the ocean to get more food for their chicks. The male penguins go as long as four months without eating, as they protect the eggs after the mothers have laid them while the females go back to eat. While watching the amazing lengths the penguins go to procreate, I couldn't help thinking what a silly animals we humans have become. These animals risk their lives to create life, and a lot of people don't want kids, or put it off until it's biologically difficult. But, then again, it's just another thing that separates us from beasts, along with those oh-so-handy opposable thumbs.The film was stunningly beautiful with its portrayal of not only the dedication of the penguins, but also the unique, almost alien, territory that surrounds them. The shots they are able to get of the penguins, be it in their mating territory, under water, or in the middle of a blizzard, are phenomenal. The film does a great job in showing both the beauty and the horror of nature, as some of the eggs and chicks don't make it. The penguins are hunted under water and on the surface, and the climate is as punishing as it is fascinating. Also, it has Morgan Freeman narrative. What's not to like about that? I absolutely loved watching it. It was fun, touching, exciting, and interesting, and only clocks in at 80 minutes, so it manages to remain entertaining throughout. Forget Dakota Fanning, or The Bad News Bears, or anything else. You won't see anything cuter in the theatres this summer than a newborn baby penguin. You probably will never see anything cuter than baby penguins learning to walk for the first time. Conversely, you probably won't see anything sadder than dying baby penguins. The movie runs the viewer through an emotional roller coaster, and is as fun an experience I have had in a movie theatre all year.I loved it. I think the only way I could've loved it more is if it were The March of the Beagles. Or the March of the Ewoks. I highly recommend you check this out when it comes to your town. PENGUINS!!!"
151,March of the Penguins,5,20 March 2014,FYI - Emperor Penguines Are Serial Monogamists,"Hey! Don't get me wrong here. I've certainly got nothing against penguins, per se. I believe that they deserve their rightful 15-minutes-of-fame just like the rest of us.But, all the same, this here documentary, meticulously chronicling these weird, flightless birds' annual journey as they march (or slide on their fat bellies) to their traditional breeding ground, certainly could've benefited (in my opinion) by having its noticeably over-long running time of 80 minutes seriously edited down to, say, 30 minutes.And if March Of the Penguins' 80-minute running time wasn't a bit too much for my patience, having to endure listening to Morgan Freeman (one of Hollywood's most boring black actors, bar none) as this documentary's celebrity-narrator was, to me, the straw that broke the camel's back, or, more appropriately (in this case) the snowflake that snapped the penguin's spine, when it came to losing points for its overall entertainment value.Yes. Set amongst the majestic scenery that's ever-present in the frozen Antarctic, this documentary was undeniably a beautiful and breathtaking sight to behold. And, why shouldn't it be? Its budget was $18 million, which clearly set its production values in the above-average range. (I kinda wonder how much Freeman was paid out of that grand sum for flapping his lips about penguins) And, besides all of that - I found myself quite put off by the way that the penguins (who are just birds, for crying out loud) were portrayed in the sense of being ""one, big, happy family"". I found that far too much emphasis was placed on using the behaviour of these wild animals as something of an example that could be closely linked to that of human behaviour.Thank goodness that the English version of this documentary wasn't ruined further as the French version was. Can you actually believe that in the French version they had the gall to give the poor penguins speaking voices and had them uttering ridiculous dialogue? I suppose this nonsense was meant to add an extra level of cuteness to the whole ordeal of these creatures mating and becoming nice, politically-correct mommy & daddy penguins.Anyways - I certainly have nothing against anybody liking this documentary in a big way. It certainly did have its share of interesting, insightful and educational moments. But, to be honest, I've learnt almost as much about the habits of penguins by watching vintage ""Chilly Willy"" cartoons with my 2 rambunctious nephews.P.S. - It's actually kind of comical to watch March Of The Penguins in fast-forward mode (just for a change of pace)."
152,March of the Penguins,6,28 December 2010,Dutch version with Urbanus,"For all the people who want's to see The march of the Penquins with a Dutch voice over, better said a voice over from Belgium, shouldn't be discouraged by the previous entries. Urbanus is maybe not the perfect voice over for the documentary, but he knows how to entertain you in a to be honest not very entertaining film. All the little facts, that maybe just are in the Dutch version, looking at the comments for the English version with Morgan Freeman, are spoken with just the right amount of humor, so the movie isn't getting to boring. And i mean just, the pictures are great, in the Dutch version the voice over is OK and i don't mind that the crew and the equipment isn't visible throughout the movie and only in the end credits, it's just gives the movie more mystery and depth for as far possible. The real downside of the movie/documentary is just that a film about penguins isn't entertaining enough for 1,5 hours, true it is beautiful shot film with a nice Dutch voice over, but Must See, no, if you don't have anything else to do, or there's nothing else on TV, see it, something better, just see that and wait for another time for The march of the Penquins."
153,March of the Penguins,9,30 April 2010,Remarkable Photography,"This is a remarkably beautiful portrayal of the yearly activities of Emperor penguins in Antarctica. It shows the grueling existence of this flightless bird which goes through torturous marches year after year to continue the species. The whole thing is done so that one egg, cared for by both male and female, can survive. These marvelous French documentarians are able to capture the intense pain and dedication of this species. What one forgets at times is that there are people with cameras following their every move, that they are going on the same march as the penguins (granted they have tents and state of the art survival equipment). This beautifully captures the gorgeous species and their communal being and their sacrifice (if it is sacrifice or simply instinct). An excellent nature documentary)."
154,March of the Penguins,10,18 October 2006,Love finds a way...,"MARCH OF THE PENGUINS was an amazing tour de force in the icy environment of the emperor penguins. The film was an extremely comprehensive look at the eventful journey of the birds who don't fly...Unfortunately I downloaded the original French version mistakenly instead of the Morgan Freeman-narrated English version which I would have wanted.. But a feature that is just as good as Morgan Freeman's skillful rendition of narration as many have mentioned - is the beautiful location photography and the way the filmmakers portray the stunning panorama of the vistas.It seems that the French have a knack for composition, and the directors lens never misses an essential detail, be it a amazing shot of the vistas of white; or a detail of one of the penguin's activities.Although, in French I was also able to discern some co-narrators telling the story from the penguin's perspective; some of them were child or infant penguins - another wise gimmick that adds more edge of cinematic storytelling to this.This is a very skillfully constructed body of work at times you may doubt some scenes were contrived. And since they weren't, that's another reason for Kudos to the filmmakers.Looking forward to seeing this again - perhaps next time the Morgan Freeman narrated version..."
155,March of the Penguins,8,8 August 2006,Life is beautiful,"This is a saga of penguins. And their survival. Living in the harshest conditions yet with a harmony and bonding that is simply spell-binding. And so is the movie. Its amazing to see and know how far these critters go for procreation and survival. Some of the moments captured are very tender. A lot of hard work has gone into making this rare masterpiece.At the end, you may not have an applause for the movie (if you do not like documentaries), but you sure will have one for the penguins and their great march.Watch it to witness the beauty of life."
156,March of the Penguins,10,23 July 2006,Wow!!,"The second-most money making documentary (after the controversial Fahrenheit 9/11), March of the Penguins is superb story telling. The correct title of the movie should be March of the Emperors. I saw the English version - the VO narration was done in several languages in different styles and even the soundtracks were different. What I saw was perfect.The story of the life-cycle of penguins living in the Antarctic is really one of the greatest love stories. Its genuinely moving. When you have seen the whole movie, you can understand the reason for the original French title of Emperors.This documentary is very informative as any good documentary should be and gives us a breath-taking look at another world in the harshest of climates."
157,March of the Penguins,10,22 July 2006,Emperor Penguins Rock!,"Wow! What an amazing story of survival. To think of and see the story and ritual that these animals endure to survive and reproduce is testament to Darwin's evolution and survival of the fittest. Emperor Penguins have found their own way to survive. Certainly not one that was ""created"" for them. The baby penguins are so cute! The photographers that shot this documentary did a fantastic job and the narration by Morgan Freeman helps us understand the thoughts and the journey of these courageous animals. I'm so impressed how they survive despite living on the edge of life and death. The father who hasn't eaten any food in over 3 months saves a tiny bit of food in a fold within his throat so his newborn baby can survive one more day awaiting the mother to return with life giving food. Incredible!"
158,March of the Penguins,10,21 July 2006,"March little penguins, march!","This movie was not only beautiful and magical but just awe inspiring almost. I found the way they gave the penguins human attributes interesting, though you had to question if it was...well, realistic. Other than that, nothing about this film really made me question it. The photography and filming was excellent, and considering that the entire set is natural as are the actors, what other negativity can you make? I saw this film in English and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially if you're a bird lover. Morgan Freeman just has that voice over thing going right on, doesn't he? In other words, watch it, it may or may not change your life, but it will leave an impact on you, even if it is considered a documentary, though I found it to be more of a bird drama, even with all the statistics and studies."
159,March of the Penguins,10,17 June 2006,An amazing film for the family,"This is a wonderful documentary about the life of emperor penguins struggling to meet a mate in Antarctica. Don't worry, there is nothing inappropriate about penguins mating for those who don't know about nature.SPOILER: I believe 6 penguins die, many babies, so if your child is under the age of 6 or you don't wish to show your child death of animals, I recommend not see this movie.It is one of the best MOVIES I've ever seen and the best documentary by far! I think this is as good as ""Spirited Away"" or ""Shrek."" Of course, you have to care about nature, or you won't give a hoot about this movie. If you would like to see this movie, you don't know if you would, or if you would like to see wonderful images, I suggest you check this one out! If I could I would give this movie 11/10! The images amaze me and the narrating was the best I've ever heard. Beautiful, magnificent, and sometimes just hilarious!"
160,March of the Penguins,10,15 May 2006,Simply beautiful,"This film is really BEAUTIFUL.All the images of the film are real art and the movie is very fun.The movie is for all ages,but principally this is a movie to enjoy with the family.The Oscar was really deserved.I would like that art films would be like this and not so pretentious like almost all art films(for example The new world or I am Dina).The movie has got a story,something that I liked a lot.The movie shows us all the drama of the penguins in winter,that they have to walk ten kilometers to make born another penguin.This documentary is amazing.It's one of the best documentaries I have seen in years.Simply beautiful."
161,March of the Penguins,9,15 May 2006,Magnificent,They don't come much better than this. Watched with my wife and we were transfixed for the full duration of the film. We learned so much about those birds that we never knew.What a wonderful display of working together to achieve a goal. The world would be a far better place if we too knew how to truly work together.Recommended to all.I will be showing this to my two young children as I know that the messages in this film will be a great benefit to them.rohanale
162,March of the Penguins,8,21 April 2006,"Impressive documentary, but let's not forget, it's about a bird","The emperor penguin has a rough life and its survival in the harsh Antarctic climate is a virtual miracle. This, to me, is the message of this impressive documentary. However, after watching the movie a question remains: What's the point of the movie? What the emperor penguin has to do to survive is incredible, but the same can be said for numerous species of animals. The grizzly bear hibernates through an entire winter; whales dive to depths of thousands of feet in search of food; birds fly thousands of miles during migrations; termites and ants build huge nests; redwood trees survive for thousands of years; the dung beetle survives in dung, etc. Technically, this movie is superb. Its story is compelling. But let's not forget: the emperor penguin is a bird, and any resemblance to a human being is purely coincidental."
163,March of the Penguins,10,19 April 2006,An animal documentary by which all others will be judged.,"What a fabulous movie Diane and I watched yesterday: a movie that assaulted the senses, a movie that brought tears to your eyes and a movie filmed under such harsh conditions you were left in disbelief that life could exist in such an inhospitable place and that humans could record it. We were totally engrossed in the panoply of Empertor penguin life recorded over the course of a year under horrific conditions and yet displaying a tenderness and life-sustaining capacity, that the film literally took your breath away.Last night I read many of the previous comments and found the negative ones beyond understanding. Perhaps I can see why Christians would object to the anthropomorphizing a bunch of animals and I can even understand how some people would object to Jacquet's choice of soundtrack but to criticize Morgan Freeman's narration is beyond my understanding. I was so absorbed by the visuals on the screen and upon his brilliantly spoken narration, that I have no memory of the soundtrack-they could have played rap and I would not have noticed. In short, I thought the film was tremendous and richly deserves all the accolades that it has collected.The movie is astounding and I freely admit that I did not know that something so tremendous happened every year in the world's most inhospitable place. I thank the French for having the intelligence to film the event and present it for the world to see!"
164,March of the Penguins,8,9 April 2006,Greetings to those that made this film possible.,"My big vote is about the beauty and opportunity of watching images and animal behavior that otherwise i would never know in a life time. This is for the trouble that those guys had for 9 months(if i can recall it right) in freezing death white cold, the REAL Blizzard Beast! I myself love animals and love to meet more and more about each one. Adding to that i may say that Morgan Freeman does a brilliant job by giving hes awesome storyteller voice, all through this documentary, makes it all more cozy even if all we see is white frost.Loved it, great images. Its a must see (specially for nature lovers)Sorry about my English Attila"
165,March of the Penguins,8,7 April 2006,Exquisitely filmed,"A charming tale of natural survival in Antarctica, March of the Penguins is about the yearly journey of Emperor penguins from their home to their breeding grounds, over frozen ground that leaves them an easy mark for predators and the elements. The vivid photography of this documentary evokes an always-harsh climate, so dangerous that many of the birds don't survive the trek.How the penguins navigate from point A to point B is still quite the mystery, as the winds and water can alter the terrain so that it appears to be completely different than it had the previous year. The penguins march, mostly single file, and when they're too tired to walk, they propel themselves on their aerodynamic bellies. When they get to their vaunted breeding ground, the males seek out females - and trust me, you haven't lived until you've witnessed two penguins courting each other. They all look alike, even to each other, you see, so they must seek out their mates by making mating calls. The female is somehow attracted to a particular call, and she hooks up with the male. Thankfully, we're denied a visual of this last action.After mating, the penguins huddle for warmth, waiting for the female to lay an egg. Penguins don't lie down, normally; they stand. After laying the egg, the female shuffles over to the male with the egg between her feet and nudges it over to the male, taking care not to let the egg touch the cold ground or be exposed to the turbulent air.Then the female makes her second long journey - this time to feed herself and bring back food for the young'un. While she's gone, the male babysits. Neither daddy nor baby have any food at all during this time, which can span three months. The females find their food and come back to feed their offspring, while the male undertakes his own second long journey.The culmination of all of this walking and waiting is that ultimately the hatchlings are left to fend for themselves. Mama Penguin leaves first, then a bit later Papa Penguin goes another way. The babies look at each other and then go off on their own as well, heading toward the ocean, which by this point is much closer (i.e., the ice and snow has melted), and take their first plunge into the deep.March is wonderfully photographed, especially considering how close up and personal the viewer can get to the birds. My goodness, these are real penguins, not autoanimatronic creations of some wacky Imagineer! If these penguins had facial expressions, you'd have seen those, too. The intimacy works very well, especially during the egg transference, detailing the ritual quite nicely.Another major plus is the stentorian narration by Morgan Freeman, who lends plenty of gravitas to a film that didn't really need it to begin with. The result is an Oscar winner for Best Documentary feature."
166,March of the Penguins,,6 April 2006,Awesome documentary,"This documentary about Emperor penguins has the most awesome footage ever seen. I fully recommend seeing the ""Movies that POP"" version, as it offers so much inside information about the actual filming and struggles of the filmmakers to bring the Penguins' story to us. This film will make you wonder why Emperor Penguins are not extinct. It's an amazing look at the obstacles they must overcome in order to propagate their species. Sure, there are sad parts - this is LIFE after all..but don't let that stop you from seeing it. The movie is not maudlin. The beauty of the Antarctic and some of the shots of the penguins are absolutely overwhelming in their content."
167,March of the Penguins,10,27 March 2006,Picking on an astounding film,"I was dazzled by this amazing film done so professionally under conditions beyond belief. It certainly deserves the accolades and popularity it has received.What is somewhat mystifying is the load of negative comments on this site. First, it must be remembered that the film has different narration (and music, in some cases), depending on the language of the country in which it is seen. I think that the English narration by Morgan Freeman is perfectly fine, along with the music. Apparently, the French did it very differently.This film is obviously not a pure scientific documentary and is not loaded with facts, figures and other arcane data. Why is that a problem? Nor is it meant to be a ""how we did this film"" tale. It was made as an observational work with some explanation of what you are seeing. It worked.The animals were not treated as humans. Those who were disturbed by the ""cruelty"" of nature should grow up. As to ""helping those poor penguins"" by feeding or otherwise protecting them from their environment, please go back to school and learn what protecting the environment is all about. The best we can do for them is not to disturb their habitat. How about worrying about what global warming will do do the ice that is integral to their lives? Great film. Ten stars."
168,March of the Penguins,10,11 March 2006,Simply Amazing,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's an excellent documentary with breath-taking moments, amazing views and wonderful chicks. I hugely recommend it. This documentary film starts off with delightful shots and strokes your soul from the very first moment. The brilliance in shooting, filming story-telling never makes you feel bored. This film is so spectacular that makes you laugh, smile and even makes you feel sad at times. To my surprise,(I had not known) it's narrated by Morgan Freeman, which makes this documentary more watchable.Besides, now I know why the academy awarded this lovely documentary with an Oscar. It surely deserves all compliments and praises. Well done folks. Hopefully giving this film an Oscar may encourage new doc-film makers. Hope this type of documentaries will be filmed in the future.10/10"
169,March of the Penguins,10,31 January 2006,Best film I had ever seen...,"Excellent real story! Touching & unbelievable great journey.I can't imagine the distant they travel.Because the emperors walked really slow.What guide them to their destination? I read that penguin is near-sighted at land.Their courtships were romantic. Emperors practice monogamy. The emperor's chick really adorable! How they recognize each other? They look extremely similar to me.The most touching part was: when the mother lost her chick, she did something that really shock me...This film is the best movie i had seen.Although the actors are not human."
170,March of the Penguins,,18 January 2006,Emperors Rule!,"Luc Jaquet's 'March of the Penguins' is a quite adorable exercise in nature film, which shows the Emperor Penguins and the stunning Antarctic landscape in all it's glory. The mating habits of these curious beasts wouldn't seem to be an obvious crowd-puller, but it's been doing grand business  I saw an afternoon performance which was ¾ capacity. These are remarkable creatures, and the simple tale of their annual breeding cycle is genuinely affecting. Morgan Freeman's narration on the English language version is perfect. Freeman is one of those few actors who can be simultaneously folksy and authoritative. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent."
171,March of the Penguins,8,14 January 2006,beautiful,March of the Penguins is the best nature film ever and one of the better documentaries. It is stunningly beautiful in the cinematography and the editing. Just those two parts would make it worth watching. March of the Penguins also has some very important things to say about life and love. But I think most of all it just wants us to fully appreciate how easy us humans have it by showing the life of some of the creatures with the hardest lives in the world. The film is also wonderfully directed. Without the great direction it could have turned into a really boring film. And Instead it is a powerful and sometimes hilarious film. March of the Penguins is the best documentary of the year and is wonderful family entertainment.
172,March of the Penguins,,21 December 2005,Triumph of The Will.........to survive.,"Peerless cinematography (Laurent Chalet, Jerome Maison) and impeccable, sensitive editing (Sabine Emiliani) make this a shoe-in for a documentary Oscar. Every camera shot, every note of Alex Wurman's lyrical score, breathes a sense of respect for these extraordinary, impossibly endearing creatures. So it is disturbing to read that in the French version Jacquet has actors voicing-over two of the penguins to express shamelessly anthropomorphised, totally unnecessary, human endearments to one another.Thankfully we are spared that crass excess in the US version. Here only Morgan Freeman's narration is heard. Many critics have considered even this overly sentimental. In truth, one cannot watch the extraordinary story of the Emperor penguins' annual walk 70 miles over the Antarctic ice, not once but six times, to and from their breeding grounds, without using words which parallel their behaviour to many of the best qualities in human beings. Without the stupid misjudgement of actor voice-overs, I defy anyone watching the mating and parenting rituals of these comic yet irreducibly dignified creatures, not to be driven to use words like tenderness, fortitude, determination, care, even grief. And they are rightly used. Freeman's words, not tone, do occasionally err towards the sentimental but nothing can diminish the stark, hardly credible story of the penguins' against-all-odds survival in the coldest place on earth.There is a serious philosophical issue here. It is not that when we see other creatures displaying behaviour like stroking, holding, caressing, gentleness etc we falsely anthropomorphise our description. Rather, if we accept our own evolutionary roots as mammals, and reject certain philosophical misconceptions about language, we should say our language of love and affection also has its roots in strikingly similar 'given' forms of behavioural response to each other and the world around us. Especially say the naked vulnerability of the newborn. The test of anthropomorphism not always easy to apply, is whether animals are attributed with behaviour that only makes sense for self-conscious, language-users. But many of our deepest human emotions such as grief have primitive roots. To describe the female penguin in the film whose chick has died from cold and who tries to steal another penguin's chick, as a form of grief is not a misuse of language. You must simply maintain a sense of penguin grief as having many important differences from human grief, despite some very real basic behavioural forms of expression in common. We recognise it because we share it.This point of view will hardly endear itself to the large Christian Fundamentalist and Creationist market the film has attracted in the US. It is hard to imagine a less convincing creature than the penguin to support the Creationist prejudice. They look like birds designed by a committee. Literally neither fish nor fowl. Or creatures who only ever made it halfway out of the evolutionary swamp. Superbly adapted for the water, their long trek across the ice plodding upright or sliding ignominiously on their stomachs seems like an almost human perversity. Out of water their flightless wings become merely charming absurdities. And their painstaking, frustrating efforts to protect first their eggs and then chicks from the lethal cold, is a triumph of determination over genuinely effective evolutionary adaption. And if God intentionally made creatures in this form then the penguin is long overdue for product recall and re-design.Much is in the eye of the beholder here. The discreetly shot pictures of the penguins mating are either sensitive or coy depending on your starting point. Also I expect it is true that the more brutal realities of penguin life are not dwelt upon at length. The only other issue I suppose is whether Jacqet has imposed a false 'narrative' on the instinct-driven struggle for survival of these beautiful creatures. Here for me a similar philosophical point to that above applies. In the seasonal, cyclical continuity and 'connectedness' of the penguin group behaviour we are perhaps witnessing the natural history basis of the apparently universal human tendency to see our lives as a story: a narrative of connected, purposeful behaviour directed to a planned and hoped for outcome with a deeper meaning.All this intellectualising apart. MOTP is a delight. OK the oooh and aagh count is high. But nothing but nothing can still the sense of extraordinary triumph over implacable necessity of these caneless Chaplinesque waddlers who seem to be locked in a perpetual battle on land at least, with the perversity of their own bodily deficiencies. The pictures are simply mesmerising; from the long strung out single file columns stretching into the distance like refugees from Dr Zhivago to the socially organic earth-bound flock of hundreds of creatures huddling for survival warmth in mutual dependence against the worst weather on the planet. You don't have to attribute human qualities to them to regard them with the utmost respect and admiration."
173,March of the Penguins,10,21 July 2005,A Wonderful Movie for the Whole Family,"This is the beautiful story of a group of penguins living in Antarctica that make several long journeys to get to their breeding ground. It follows these penguins as they give birth to chicks and then bring them up. At the beginning this movie goes slowly, and young children may get bored, but as soon as you see the adorable penguin chicks, it will be hard to take your eyes off the screen. It is really touching to see these penguins walking 70-80 miles for the sake of their children, bearing extreme temperatures. The whole family will find this entertaining, but young children may be disturbed by the pictures of dead penguins and hawks eating penguins. Overall, this is an amazing movie with remarkable footage, something that you won't want to miss."
174,March of the Penguins,5,13 October 2005,Hard to call this film a documentary.,"I'll start with the good. The cinematography was spectacular. The subject matter and its general presentation (excluding the voice over) were compelling.Now the bad . . . in a word: ""anthropomorphism"". The film couldn't run sixty seconds without imposing some sort of human emotion on these penguins. I don't doubt that these animals ""feel"" something, but to suggest they feel the advanced emotional responses suggested by the film in the context of a documentary is irresponsible. In fact, from what I saw in the film, there was quite a bit to suggest the emotions shared by the adult penguins differed radically from most human experience.What I found most irritating, was that the story on its own merits (what these crazy birds endure to procreate) was more than compelling enough to make for a good documentary film. But instead, we had to listen to Morgan Freeman make up his own story about what was going on as he went along. I was reminded of my university days flipping channels with a few buddies, stumbling across a film in a language none of us understood, and making up our own comical dialogue for the actors.If a film maker wants to call their work a documentary, they should make every effort to be true to their subject matter. Little such effort was made here. In fact, I think the film makers truly sold out for greater commercial success."
175,March of the Penguins,5,23 September 2005,Not a documentary,"After watching this beautifully filmed piece of drivel, I looked up ""bird"" on the wikipedia. In 5 minutes I learned far more about penguins than this false-documentary explains.Please, this is the FOX News of documentaries. It has been edited to specifically draw you across a story, a story which is often made up by the editor, leaving facts behind. There is little knowledge passed, little facts discussed, but there are many tightly edited scenes with Morgan Freeman telling us what we should believe is happening. Disagree? Watch again and notice that when a female penguin slows at a crack in the ice, there is a close-up of her face, a quick edit to a seal attack, then back to her face. This edit means nothing. Nothing. But as a gimmick, it leads us to believe that she is pausing because she is afraid of being killed. Possibly she is. Who asked her though? Where is the scene where the crew asks the penguin if she is afraid? It isn't there for obvious reasons, but this lack of depth certainly won't stop the editors and Morgan Freeman from persuading us otherwise.The film is so glurgy and sweet that it can't even use the word death. Pengiuns don't freeze to death, they fall asleep forever. Chicks don't die, they are lost.This is now my favorite film to hold in contempt against the front of idiots."
176,March of the Penguins,10,22 August 2005,What would YOU do for love??,"I haven't had the luxury of seeing this movie as of yet, but can say without a doubt, that I am more respectful of such a creature who would brave some of the harshest of climates just for love. Penguins are monogamous (they chose one love and stay with that love). This is a thinkers movie....if you're not a child. For those who are children, this movie is what a movie should be, it's a movie that shows basic emotions and teaches devotion to one another. I don't have children but if I did, I wouldn't hesitate to take them to this movie. Ask yourself, would you brave some the harshest weather to find THE ONE?? Btw, I hear Antarctica can be quite cold, don't forget 160mph winds too, I wonder what the wind chill is? I think this movie can teach us all to respect nature and who knows maybe it can make us look at ourselves a little deeper."
177,March of the Penguins,,23 February 2005,"Beautiful, moving and inspiring movie set in the South Pole ;-)","I loved this movie! What I mean is I loved the penguins, their terrible fate and constant battle against the extreme cold, hunger and predators. The images are awesome, I don't know how the cameramen managed to get such close shots, but the result is magnificent. I especially recommend the movie to animal-lovers of any kind, but I'm sure it would even re-conciliate the worst ""animal-hater"" anytime! however, I do agree that the voice-over is overdone. It is supposed to give some rhythm and emotion to the film, but at some dramatic moments it was hard to keep from laughing out loud...And the music was a bit weird, I'm not a fan of the Bjorg-like girl who sings. I think classical music would have been much more adapted to the atmosphere...And by the way, it's in the South Pole, not in the North (so chance to see penguins up there, but you might bump into a polar bear or 2 ;-)"
178,March of the Penguins,,20 July 2005,"Good Photography, Dull Narration, Jarring Music","I have to admit that the March of the Penguins was a pretty big disappointment. Morgan Freeman's English-language narration is dull and uninspired. The best narrations are those that don't call attention to the personality of the narrator, but leave you waiting for the credits to find out ""who was that guy?"" In this case, though, it was impossible to do other than to recognize Freeman's voice at every turn. The tone of his narration is too low, his presentation too dull, and the lack of any sense of enthusiasm in his voice was unfortunate in such an otherwise interesting film. The penguins deserved better.Worse than that, though, was the jarring electronic music that accompanied Freeman's narration. At times the sound was so loud that Freeman's words were hard to understand. When you imagine how much better a classical score would have been the music in this film seems egregiously bad.Some of the photography in the film was marvelous, though is it really something we haven't seen before? I'm sorry to be so negative about this March of the Penguins. It's not a really bad film, just disappointing. Or maybe I'm just suffering from emperor penguin overload."
179,March of the Penguins,1,20 February 2007,Oh dear.,"What a shame, this had the potential to be a really nice movie but it turned out to be one of the most condescending and insultingly manipulative movies I have ever been subjected to. So enraged was I that I actually turned the movie off after about 30 minutes. That is the first time I have ever done so. I sat through 'Crash', I sat through 'V for Vendetta' (albeit grinding my teeth), but this was just too much...The crowning insult of this travesty is the fact that it takes about 85 minutes to do half of what David Attenborough does in a third of that time. Being a huge fan of Attenborough, and having seen countless programs of his which study penguins, 'March' had absolutely nothing to offer me. To make things worse, the penguins were presented in an achingly simplified, anthropomorphic way which made the whole experience like watching one of those straight-to-video Disney spin-off movies.I got as far as the ""love scene"" before I decided I'd had enough of being patronised. This scene was so shameless in its unabashed attempt to manipulate the viewer (super slow-mo, extreme close-ups et al) that it was like watching outtakes from a really bad Ridley Scott movie.I can kind of understand that this was as popular as it was, as it pushes all of the same lowest-common-denominator buttons as a sub-par RomCom. If that's your bag, you'll love this tripe.However, if you have a brain, are a half-way mature person (10+), hate to be patronised by movies or know anything at all about penguins, do yourself a favour and find some old BBC nature documentaries instead. This film is truly - literally - unbearable."
180,March of the Penguins,4,20 March 2006,A huge nature documentary disappointment,"This movie was one of the biggest disappointments I have had in a very long time. Compared to the typical shoot-em-up and car chase fare it was superb, but as a nature documentary it ranks at the bottom of the scale. It seems like a huge waste of an opportunity to engage the audience to spend almost an hour and a half on Emperor penguins and not discuss how big they are, what they weigh, what they eat, how they keep their feet from freezing to the ice, and any number of other relevant and interesting facts. The attempt to Anthropomorphosize the penguins and evoke emotion by talking about the love the penguin had for its dead chick seemed like nothing but a cheap stunt. If you have never watched a nature documentary before you should by all means go see it. However, you're much better off to get one of the top notch documentaries like the 4-DVD Blue Planet spectacular where you actually learn something and aren't just treated to images of hardship and ""love"" of dead chicks."
181,March of the Penguins,8,14 December 2006,Best nature movie ever made,"Of course, there isn't much action here but the movie is interesting as we follow the long involved process of making baby penguins in Antarctica. Amazing how the birds repeatedly go on marches of 70 miles to and from the sea and how the fathers go four months without eating a thing amid temperatures reaching as low as minus 80.The birds themselves are beautiful too. You probably think of penguins as silly looking creatures and in a way they are, but these are the emperor penguins and stand 3-4 feet tall. They are gorgeous with their black and white and a streak of orange fur that is so sleek and shiny it looks like it was sprayed on. And needless to say, the chicks are cute as can be."
182,March of the Penguins,10,16 January 2006,"...it is about hope, faith and love.","Are we humans better than them? Are we really ""smarter"" and ""superior""? I was touched by this movie. This movie is not about nature or about wildlife. It shows nature and wildlife, but it is about hope, faith and love.We have no right to judge the animals. They have lived on this earth for more time that we can imagine. And yet, they have kept this planet intact. Could we do the same?Could we rise our children and protect them from the elements when we cannot protect them from our own kind? They are simple beast, but maybe in their eyes lies something more that their limited condition. Lies a story about surviving in the most horrible place on this planet, for tens of thousand of years. They have adapted, and they have found ways. Incredible ways...This is superb. I like it, and I hope you will too. Life as it is with pain, sadness, sorrow, but in small, not exaggerated portions, yet with a happy end.Simply life on the southeast part of OUR planet."
183,March of the Penguins,9,9 January 2006,"A movie with a lot of penguins about, but no Danny De Vito","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A film about the march of the emporer penguins in their native Antartica, the home they refused to leave and have kept as their own. The film charts their survival during the harsh climate change and the roles of the mother and father penguins as the new eggs hatch.It seems I've gone from one extreme to another with my most recent visits to the cinema, what with seeing the gob-smackingly violent Running Scared last time and next time a film as gentle and quietly dignified as March of the Penguins.It was quite a big thing for National Geographic to fund their first big screen movie, even more so to get a big star like Morgan Freeman interested in narrating the UK version. Chavs might find it 'a bit boring' but to the more refined cinema-goer amongst us, March of the Penguins is an informative, absorbing, occasionally humorous and even touching film, unenviably now the highest grossing documentary of all time next to Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11.It's a film that teaches us how these malevolent creatures aren't that different to us and charts their everyday battle for survival. We're guided along by Morgan Freeman's gentle, easy-flowing narration. We sense the responsibility shared amongst the penguins, the sense of danger when their lives are threatened and even sadness when they suffer (the scenes where the mother penguin bows her head down and makes a sorrowful noise are similar to us crying.) If you're in the mood for learning rather than seeing, this comes highly recommended. ****"
184,March of the Penguins,9,8 January 2006,Beautiful and fascinating...,"March of the Penguins is one of those rare documentaries that shines a light on how beautiful this planet is. The ""march"" of the Emperor Penguins is an incredible story and the writers and director of this film do an excellent job highlighting every fascinating detail.Who would think that a species of animal could sacrifice so much all in the name of continuing the species? In the world that we humans live in, perhaps a lesson could be learned by the selfless actions of a species that risks death everyday of the child-rearing process. It is simply astounding to see what these creatures must go through, from their first weeks-long march, to the egg-guarding processes, to the series of walks back and forth to ensure the chicks' survival.March of the Penguins is an eye-catching, informative and emotionally charged journey and is one of the best documentaries I have seen in years. This is a film for the whole family and one that, once you've seen, you will never forget."
185,March of the Penguins,10,4 January 2006,Film is not appropriate for everyone,"My family and I watched ""March of the Penguins"" on Christmas Eve, believing the reviews that called it a ""love story for the whole family"". What we saw was a documentary, beautifully filmed and narrated, but ultimately so depressing it brought everyone down. Yes, the penguins are comical when they walk, and their devotion is touching, but nature is hardly ever benign, and this film, while not dwelling on the ""survival of the fittest"" aspect, does touch on it several times. I feel that young children will be horrified by parts of this, as I was. I was left feeling very sorry for the penguins and wondering what their purpose in life is. Which led me to wonder about my purpose in life. Which led me to the whole existential thing....and here it is, several weeks later and I'm still wondering.To sum up: Film should win all sorts of awards for photography, but in my humble opinion it's right up there with ""Das Boot"" for family fare."
186,March of the Penguins,9,1 January 2006,Beautiful and mesmerizing,"La Marche de l'empereur (aka March of the Penguins) was one of the best films of 2005. Directed by Luc Jacquet, he beautifully and realistically captures the mating and birth cycle of the Emperor Penguins that live in the South Pole over a period of 9 months. By making the journey personal with the penguins, it brings the audience to appreciate their hard labors as they have to confront winter storms, long periods of darkness, and starvation just to bring ONE life per couple into being. The cinematography by Laurent Chalet and Jérôme Maison is breathtaking to say the least and only does the film even more justice. This is truly a film everyone should see. An outstanding 9 out of 10."
187,March of the Penguins,,11 December 2005,What Penguins Do,"This documentary plays well on the big screen. You get the sense of the fast winds, maybe even the cold (-80 degrees!). An egg breaks, and one assume it is not time-lapse footage that shows it literally crystallizing in seconds. The cold of space, as it were.Thousands of penguins converge on a spot in Antarctica, partially shielded by some hills, to mate and produce the next generation of Emperor Penguins. They march in a single line, mostly, across the barren ice to this place from a shoreline, or breaks in the ice cap, this is many, many miles distant. The penguins couple for purposes of mating and rearing one, single chick.The narrator is Morgan Freeman. His voice is not intrusive. And contrary to what others have said, Freeman's is the only voice-over in the entire film. But the script he reads was written to somehow humanize or anthropomorphize these penguins. Rather than temporary couplings, meant to create and protect the young, these are described as penguin - families. But they are not families. Indeed, the initial lines of the script speak of the great Pangea and the separation of the continents by drift. One 'tribe', Freeman reads, stays with the Antarctic block, intentionally - because they thought it might warm up again, or something. The 'tribe'. In fact, with a long shot of many penguins waddling in the distance, Freeman reads, they may not that different from us. Well - they're penguins. They are different from us.This so-called, family, exists only as long as the offspring survives. If there is no egg - no family. If they drop the egg or it otherwise freezes - no family. If one of the pair doesn't return - no family. And at the end of this period of many months, even if the chick survives, both 'parents' . . split - no family. The chicks are left to fend for themselves for a few weeks as the ice breaks up a bit, in summer. And then they take to the water, and aren't heard from again for five years. And if they've survived, at year five, they start marching and do it all over again.What's stunning is a) the complexity of the penguins trading off feeding and care duty, and how effective massing their bodies for protection is against probably a wind-chill in excess of -100 degrees and winds that it is said can reach 100mph. You'd think the lot of them would be frozen or blown away. First the male guards the egg as the females all head back to the sea to feed. This is the dead of winter, the big storms, the cold and wind. The males go hungry for up to four months, and lose half their body weight. But when the females return, they take up protection/feeding of the chicks, and the males take off to feed. And they keep trading this duty back and forth, as the melting shoreline approaches much closer to the flock, until something tells them that the chicks are old enough to be on their own. And then both adult penguins walk away.B) the still shots make it look like another world. Ice walls seeming to be half a mile high just sticking up out of the ice. Weird structures that look like some modernist architects vision of the latest museum. The images are riveting.C) just the fact that they could film this in those conditions. It will be interesting to see the 'extras' on the DVD. For now, the only hint you have is some footage of the crew around the penguin flock shown in a window as the credits roll. It shows the penguins waddling up to the camera and adorably pecking the lens, and so on - tick . . tick.All in all, it's certainly a movie with 'cute' all over it. How could it not be with these penguins, and particularly the baby penguins playing in the snow? It's the only film I can recall that actually portrays a seal as a villain. The seals hunt the penguins. One was half expecting 'Jaws' music after awhile. And seagulls go after the babies. But, not a lot of people like seagulls, to begin with. Interesting film. One of the seemingly rare films, today, that actually is worth the ticket price."
188,March of the Penguins,10,8 December 2005,Why two versions?,"I don't get it why it was necessary to rework this great French film with just a single narrator and a 24/7-orchestral soundtrack. Because the penguin's point-of-view narration and the pseudo-tech Bjork-like soundtrack, as difficult as they may be for some, is just the thing - besides of course the astonishing and breath-taking cinematography - that makes this movie so unique and such a great and special work of art.I'm happy that the German distributors decided for the original French version while they were dubbing it and thus stayed as close as they could to the original character of the movie. As nice as the Morgan Freeman-version may be and as mass-appealing the orchestral soundtrack may be - that's like showing ""Dirty Dancing"" with French chansons or German polka.It should at least have been possible to get both versions on 1 DVD, wherever the US version was released. More respect for art (and different cultures), please."
189,March of the Penguins,10,1 December 2005,The Sacrifices of Procreation and the Timeless Dignity of the Emperor Penguins,"As a moment of respite and perspective in a world cluttered with tribal warfare, human responses to natural disasters, and the garish flames of politics, MARCH OF THE PENGUINS reminds us of the eternal cycle of life, life perpetuated against all manner of foes and odds, and helps us re-center our blurring focus. This eloquently beautiful film, a documentary that goes well beyond the genre limitations, is a work of art by Director Luc Jacquet and his fearless crew of photographers, and as art should, it brings a subject into focus that reminds us of the space each organism occupies with dignity on this troubled planet.The story is simple yet profound: the Antarctica Emperor penguins yearly march from the sea to the breeding grounds, mate monogamously, procreate, the females leave their egg with the fathers and return to the sea for food, returning to nourish the new chicks, relieving the fathers to make their food trek to the sea, returning to relieve the mothers who depart for food only to return and conjointly raise their newborns, then make the sacrifice of leaving the chicks to mature and plop into the sea to begin the whole cycle again. These elegant and warmly humorous birds endure the outer extremes of nature all for the sake of nurturing their progeny. The cycle is fascinating in its centuries old repetition of ritual and wonderfully pertinent to the re-evaluating the human family unit! The photography is magnificent, finding not only the intimacy of the penguins, but the rapture of the frigid sea where they dive impossible depths for foods, and also the majesty of the Antarctica complete with 'Southern lights'. This film is a work of magic and happily can be shared with all generations, each segment from the very young to the very elderly will find a special message. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp"
190,March of the Penguins,7,4 October 2005,I think the directors missed an opportunity to teach us,"I left with the impression that it was alternately sensual and ridiculous: sensual in its beautiful cinematography, particularly the slow-motion of the penguins' mating dance and ritual, and ridiculous in that at times all you could see was thousands of ovoid animals flopping about.I think the directors missed a huge opportunity here, though. They ought to have anticipated that their audience, having already self-selected to pay $9 for footage of melting glaciers, would have loved to geek out on Emperor penguin arcania. They've obviously put so much heart and soul into capturing the up-close, on-location footage that they couldn't have gotten without first learning a whole lot about these animals. Why didn't they pass on some of those amazing learnings to us?"
191,March of the Penguins,8,21 August 2005,As a nature lover I found this documentary a little disappointing,"One problem is I've seen much, though not all, of this before. Still there's no question these film-makers have completed the circle on this tale in a loving and reverent way and with little apparent regard for their personal comfort. And there were revelations including some landscape shots that I don't recall having seen before that were so clearly unique and searingly authentic that they threaten to upstage all previous attempts to capture the extreme beauty of the locations. Unfortunately it would be hard to get enough of those shots into any length documentary. Even when the subject is not the land itself but one of its hardier inhabitants. I would say if you can't conjure up clear images of Emperor penguins already then do go and see it in the theater as you are not likely to be able to put it out of your mind if you do.What further dampened my reaction to this film was what I had heard about its acquisition. As I understand it the distributors paid a pittance for it so that the French producers are being cut out of the movie's heavy profits. I can only hope I've misinterpreted what I've heard as that would truly be a travesty."
192,March of the Penguins,10,13 January 2018,Spheniscidae in all its glory,"We often hear about penguins and sometimes see them in zoos. But not until you see them in their natural habitat do you get a true sense of what their lives are. The Academy Award-winning documentary ""La marche de l'empereur"" (""March of the Penguins"" in English) shows a number of emperor penguins walking - and sometimes sliding - back to their breeding ground for the winter. And remember, this is an Antarctic winter. The documentary tugs at the heart occasionally, since not every member of the group survives. After all, there's no room for error in Antarctica's winter.I understand that in some countries, the documentary gets narrated in first person, as though the penguins are conversing with each other. Since I've only seen the English-language version, I only heard third-person narration by - who else? - Morgan Freeman. Whatever the case, this is one impressive documentary. It deserved its Oscar win (although it did have strong competition in Alex Gibney's documentary about Enron). Good one."
193,March of the Penguins,10,13 October 2017,"""There are few places hard to get to in this world. But there aren't any where it's harder to live.""","If this weren't a true nature story, I don't think you would be able to make it up and have anyone believe you. What the Emperor Penguin goes through for the sake of keeping the species alive is nothing short of extraordinary. Virtually every revelation about their habits is astounding and almost too numerous to mention. A seventy mile hike to their breeding grounds in the Antarctic is just the beginning of their amazing adventure, as narrator Morgan Freeman takes the viewer through the penguins' mating ritual, the competition between females for the male's attention, how they maintain some semblance of warmth in sub-freezing temperatures, the transference of eggs from the female to the male to keep them safe, and the eventual birth of the chicks. It's astounding that the parent birds go for months at a time without food during this ordeal, compounded by the harsh reality of retracing their long march to feed and bring food back for the baby penguins.As I'm usually curious about what negative reviewers have to say, (because there's always someone), I guess I can sympathize with those who say they found this documentary boring. It does move slow at times, but I fail to understand why anyone wouldn't find the subject matter fascinating. It's not like the eighty minute run time intrudes on one's life to such a degree that one can't pay attention. I did find a particular scene that came across as kind of comical to me. It was a specific shot of the massive penguin colony huddled together against the cold, and the way the camera caught them in the sunlight with their blue-gray backs and distinct body markings, it looked like a stadium full of Navy cadets assembled for a football game!"
194,March of the Penguins,6,2 August 2017,Picking up a penguin,"Morgan Freeman narrates the saga of Emperor penguins in the harsh Antarctica landscape to mate, breed and raise junior penguins. A ritual that has been carried on for centuries as Emperor penguins make a great march to the same place each year with solid ice and a bit of cover from ice cold temperatures and blustery wind. All to procreate and endure the hardship of their wilderness as well as seeking to avoid predators.This documentary has amazing photography which is a delight to watch but I felt I wanted to know something more about the penguins and why they carry out this savage journey of 70 miles each year.The film also makes the mistake of making penguins out to be cuddly and human-like. They are not, they are birds and behave like birds which aspects of the documentary skates around from. Some of the romantic gloss the filmmakers added was really a bit silly."
195,March of the Penguins,,17 May 2017,Tear jerker,This was the single saddest film in the history of film. The combination of the ominous godlike voice over combined with the harsh reality of the animal kingdom cakes this film a tear jerker for everyone. Although this film is a non fiction documentary it makes you feel as though you're watching a well developed story. All around a great movie.
196,March of the Penguins,6,13 November 2016,epic nature parenthood,"Morgan Freeman narrates this Luc Jacquet documentary about the emperor penguins. The monogamous couples walk to their traditional breeding grounds where they laid one egg each. The couple carefully balance the egg on one's feet to incubate it while the other goes back to the ocean to feed. They would transfer the egg as each partner goes back. It's a long dark winter as the sea freezes and the distance walked gets further and further. The mass of penguins huddle against the cold while their partners hunt for fish avoiding deadly seals. It's an epic of parenthood in nature. The story is touching although it may be too humanized. It doesn't as much eat or be eaten as most other nature film. For some reason, Freeman's narrations threw me off. It's never not Freeman and it's harder to get lost in the penguins. Overall, this is a good nature film."
197,March of the Penguins,8,4 October 2016,great documentary,"Great the way it was transmitted the emperor penguin march, there is nothing but admiration for the determination of these animals, they overcome enormous obstacles, to return to their breeding grounds and begin the mating season, becoming heroes. I think Jacquet with his history could make us feel somehow related to the rituals of penguins, because the movie gave the Penguins a series of human records: they were funny, romantic, tender, awkward, sad and playful. The film ensures stunning images full of beauty, a lot of emotion and empathy for these animals. The film is a success in terms of showing the necessary without being long and tedious, showing the crude reality but in a beautiful way focusing on the wonder of nature."
198,March of the Penguins,6,2 November 2015,Pretentious Portrayal,"This documentary has all the qualities of a good drama. It has actually dramatized the penguins' lives into those of human beings. Compassion is good. Presumption, squeezing human emotions into other species, is not. Penguins are like all creatures, big and small, in their worthiness and rights to exist in the way they want. There is no need to apply human beings' senses to them in order to gain sympathy. I admire this film's beauty and elegance in the presentation. The film's crew is most entitled to the given awards and honors. The unintentional effect, though, is a violation of nature itself. We are supposed to watch, observe, and co-exist with fellow beings in the nature if we are truly respectful of them. An early scene of the whole flock of penguins confronting a severe snow storm during the breeding is narrated as if we knew what they were and really felt. What a presumption. Old-style animal documentaries become classic works because they do not presume to know more than the eyes meet. We are freed up to develop our own understanding and, quite likely, compassion towards what we see and learn. Today's filmmakers become a man who knows too much, clotting the screen with new tools and tactics, depriving the audience their freedom and creativity. Nature ceases being nature, and a media invention is made. This is not a trend that supports the unity of living organisms. Instead, it is a forced humanization of the worst kind. We watch a documentary on Penguins to know Penguins, not knowing better of fellow human beings, which is already in abundance."
199,March of the Penguins,7,16 June 2015,Everybody's Favorite Bird,"A look at the annual journey of Emperor penguins as they march -- single file -- to their traditional breeding ground.Everybody loves penguins. They are one of the most popular exhibits at any zoo. They look cute, and make great cartoon characters. And even in real life, they are clearly very fascinating.In the English version, Morgan Freeman narrates. Of course, this always makes any film better. I cannot say if the other narrators are as good. But I will say this is a brilliant way to make the film international -- the footage has no spoken language at all, so just change the narrator and you can easily show it in another country without pesky dubbing or subtitles. Clever!"
200,March of the Penguins,8,22 May 2015,Wonderful documentary,"Wonderful documentary.The telling of how emperor penguins in the Antarctic travel a vast distance to mate and how the parents then have to endure the harshest conditions on Earth to ensure their offspring are born, survive and thrive. A story of life, survival, and regeneration. Incredible footage. Some amazing camera placements and angles. There could not have been a manned camera in some of the spots, so passive cameras were used. Very ingenious placement at times.Then, of course, there is the narration. Nobody could have done it better than Morgan Freeman. Such gravitas and feeling.A great reminder of the wonder of nature, and the struggles that some species undergo to survive and grow."
201,March of the Penguins,10,30 April 2015,March On!,"March of the Penguins (2005): Dir: Luc Jacquet / Narrator: Morgan Freeman: Extraordinary documentary about persistence and struggles symbolized within a long winter march taken every year. Penguins gather in massive quantities and trek in nearly single file to the breeding ground. There are many facts to consider such as the females going away for months to gather food while the males protect and shelter the eggs. These males go several months without food before the female returns. There are several species of penguin. Perhaps the most common is the emperor or king penguin, which is said to grow to four feet tall, making it the biggest of the species. Others include the humboldt penguin, chinstrap penguin, and rockhopper penguin. Director Luc Jacquet enlightens viewers upon the harsh conditions in which these unusual birds live but even further he creates a film that demonstrates real character. He takes what is presented on wildlife programs and presents it in narrative form and it works. Morgan Freeman 's deep knowledgeable voice narrates the film thus giving further insight. The result is a film that will appeal to young and old alike with something to offer children to learn as well as the scholars to further study. It is one of the best films of the year, and like The Passion of the Christ the previous year, it shocked the industry by marching away as a hit. Score: 10 / 10"
202,March of the Penguins,8,27 December 2014,Penguins At The South Pole,"Fascinating and beautifully made documentary narrated by actor Morgan Freeman shows the migratory journey of a colony of emperor penguins at the south pole who must make the 70-mile trek from their shores inland in order to get to the mating grounds, where they face even more hardships, as it is the mothers who must make the return journey to the water in order to find food(evading waiting predators), and the fathers who stay behind to take care of their egg by concealing them under a flap of furry skin to shield them from the blistering cold, while they face starvation themselves. Even after the eggs are hatched(not all will survive) they face threats from predators and continued freezing weather, as they live in the harshest climate on Earth... A real achievement in filmmaking will resonate most with animal lovers, but will still appeal to all in fine family entertainment."
203,March of the Penguins,8,16 September 2014,Breathtaking documentary on the ingenious breeding ways of penguins,"I recently watched director Luc Jacquet's newest movie about trees and thought it would also be time to see his Academy Award winning documentary centered on penguins. I found out that i knew nothing about these wonderful animals and their strenuous march. Those moments where they meet coincidentally and when they ""kiss"" each other were simply perfect. As great as these moments were, there are also a few sad ones: such as the unsuccessful hatching from the unexperienced penguins. And of course once gotten out of the eggs, the little penguins are just too cute. I watched the German dubbed version and thought the voice actors for father and mother penguin did an amazing job. Their voices were so soothing. I did not like the young penguin's voice initially, but it grew on me a bit. I read that for the American version, Morgan Freeman did the narration. While he is usually a great narrator, I imagine it difficult to convey the same emotions as they were done here when we had different narrators for mother and father penguin.From the visual aspect, this documentary is a must see: giant ice sheets and we here chilly, almost dreamlike music. It is just too awesome how the little penguins slide over them on their bellies while making the most amazing noises. It is truly funny to see the penguins walking right behind one another as if they were standing in an almost never-ending queue and they are making funny moves with their heads all the time. When they finally reached the place they were born themselves, they are looking for a partner to father/mother their baby penguins in the future. As there is usually more female penguins than males, there can be quite heavy physical arguments about who gets the male, but once they found each other they hold their beaks very close to one another and softly tough each other with their beaks as well to signalize they belong together for the coming months. The noise we hear in the movie from the penguins is almost robot-like. Those who are alone have not succeeded though and they may not have the slightest chance of survival (one of the saddest scenes the dark penguin shadow in the blood-red sky) as the huge quantity of mating penguins creates warmth that keeps each other alive against these icy temperatures at the South Pole.At the beginning of June, the egg is laid and it needs to be covered immediately by the amazingly fluffy belly fur of the penguins as otherwise the beating heart inside cannot survive against the cold or the shell may break and make all the struggles for nothing. That is why many eggs with broken shells can be seen, given up by the parents who are on their way back to the sea. When they manage to keep the egg intact though, the father starts keeping it warm for two months while the mother is off to the sea collecting fish. It is truly a smart way in which all the males keep rotating so that everybody gets to be inside the group at some point protected by the warmth from the penguins around him and won't have to freeze. Of course the mothers are in danger too. If they get attacked and killed by seals, the egg is lost as well without the father knowing. If the father does not get fish in time, he will have to give up the egg and go to the sea himself in order to stay alive.So lets summarize. The first march is towards the place where they were born and the mating takes place. The second march is the mother going back to the sea getting fish. And the third march is the mother returning to her penguin boyfriend and hopefully intact egg. That third march takes place during darkness, so it an amazing display of orientation. During that time, the father has not eaten for four months and lost half his weight. He is forced to give up the egg any day if the mother will not come soon.Roughly at minute 40 you can see a small beak looking out of the egg and the baby penguins begin to hatch. Cuteness galore. The father regurgitates a white substance that the baby penguin eats right out of his father's throat. The mother arrives and sees the little penguin for the first time. The penguin family is reunited finally. It is amazingly cute to watch this little fluffy gray penguin ball stumbles across the ice. But even there, it is not safe yet. Many parents lose their freshly-hatched penguins to the cold and are so devastated that they try to take other penguins from their parents simply because they cannot cope with the loss they experienced. The noises they make while mourning are pretty heartbreaking as well. And besides the cold there is another danger: skuas (big gulls) who try to catch some of the tiny penguins and eat them. The parents have to give everything to protect them. At the end, we see the young penguins, slightly grown up already leaving together, occasionally jumping on their bellies just like their parents did. They will probably never see their parents again and not much later their own endeavor of marching towards becoming parents is about to start.""La marche de l'empereur"" is a wonderful wildlife documentary and I can't recommend it enough. Unless you are an ultimate expert on penguins, you will learn so much about them. I'm happy I decided to give it a watch."
204,March of the Penguins,10,28 February 2014,Interesting documentary,"I think this movie is interesting and beautiful. Now, because this is a French film, some of you people are thinking ""Wait! Don't you hate dubs?"" To be honest, yes, I do. An awful lot. And I find them infuriating, but this movie is the exception. The difference is that this movie is a documentary, because it does not get overly concerned to be considered a foreign language film, whether animated or live action, as well the only voice-over changed is the narrator, so that change is passable. Morgan Freeman did a good job narrating this movie about emperor penguins.If you are a fan of penguins or documentaries, try this movie out."
205,March of the Penguins,6,11 January 2014,Ice-zone zealots,"Here is a simple documentary about birds living in the harshest environment on Earth, with never so much as a tree or a cave for shelter.They march 70 miles for food, risk getting eaten by sea lions, and huddle together in 80-below temperatures amid lashing winds -- all to give birth to fuzzy gray chicks that will grow up to repeat the cycle.From a distance, penguins look startlingly like people against the backdrop of this frigid no-man's land. Their movements are often endearing, and one quickly grasps the inspiration for cartoons like ""Happy Feet."" I watched this with my 11-year-old son, who particularly enjoyed the penguins' beguilingly adorable offspring. (When their tummies are full, there's nothing cuter!)Many countries have research stations way, WAY down under, but we are given no sense of where they are in relation to these throngs of loud-mouthed waddlers. A map would have been appreciated, and I'd have liked to learn a little more about these stomach sledders -- about their numbers, their varieties, and why the South Pole region is their one and only habitat. While this film can be visually dazzling, the audience's other senses are mostly neglected. On a recent trip to the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, my kids and I noticed a stench while viewing a couple of penguins in their outdoor pen. Antarctica's throngs must truly reek but nothing is said of that. We do learn a little about how bird calls help the seemingly identical penguins to tell each other apart. In addition, predators get mention but aren't really described. In one instance, an awkward seagull-like creature seems to capture a straying chick. Does it actually kill the unfortunate fuzz ball? We never know. And while we get many glimpses of dripping ice, global warming and its impact on penguin culture gain nary a mention. In all, a little more information would have improved this admirable effort considerably."
206,March of the Penguins,10,11 August 2013,"A story so beautiful, only nature could write it","I don't even know where to start with a documentary this immensely moving. In just 80 minutes, Luc Jacquet did what every director should aspire to do - create a piece of work that makes you cry, makes you smile, and uplifts your spirits and he did it all with nothing but a Super-16 Aaton XTR prod and one dedicated team; All this to capture one of the most naturally beautiful things that takes occurrence on this planet. As everyone reading this will already be aware, this documentary gives stunning insight into the breeding season of one of natures most innocuous, loving, dedicated and breathtakingly determined creatures on Earth; The Emperor Penguin. Every year, around April, when the ice is thick, thousands upon thousands of emperor Penguins begin a 70+ mile trek across one of natures most unforgiving landscapes. The Journey is brutal, and it has to be made more than once, but the results, at least to these inspirational animals, are worth it. Finding a partner, mating, travelling up to 100 miles to find food, all in the vein of creating new life and it is such a fascinating thing to watch. Antarctica often seems worlds away, so for someone like Jacquet to bring us this documentary is commendable and whilst I have reserves about saying this, I think having Morgan Freeman do the VO was a stroke of Genius - Freeman is a beloved star in the west and I honestly think him being a part of this, grabbed a lot of peoples attention who maybe otherwise wouldn't of thought twice about sitting down to watch a documentary about Penguins. To sum-up I just want to say that this is one of my all time favourite documentaries and it was truly a joyful experience to watch it. It is 80 minutes of your day you wont regret giving up and certain images from it, will never, ever leave your head - for better or worse. 10/10."
207,March of the Penguins,7,10 July 2013,Life and death.,"This nature documentary turned blockbuster is a film about life and death. The penguins march to the breeding grounds within the first 15 minutes and the following hour is the struggle to keep their young alive. The mortality of the penguins is often harrowing, giving the concepts of their bonds, loss and determination, when each step could kill their chicks. It's a cute, amusing and poignant film with moments of great jeopardy, though lots of contrived editing to force these together, but it often works as I completely forgot about the camera and can't even imagine what the crew had to go through. It tries to bypass its theme of mortality using words like ""disappear"" or ""gone,"" sticking to family values and never saying it but sometimes showing it. That naivety and briefness about the film holds it back from being as profound as it could potentially be, but it's not going to try to be that. The music dances with the image, as does Morgan Freeman's smooth narration. It's entertaining and interesting.7/10"
208,March of the Penguins,8,19 May 2013,March on over and watch this documentary!,"Amazing and touching documentary about life in one of the harshest places on Earth. March of the Penguins tells the story on a colony of Emperor Penguins after 5 years living in the sea will march nearly 70 miles on frozen tundra to their breeding ground, far inland from the oceans where they thrive. It is there, that the cycle of life continues for them, as both female and male Penguins go through trials and tribulations with multiple arduous trips between the ocean and the breeding ground to give birth to the next generation. Director Luc Jacquet and his devoted crew from National Geographic Society endured a full year of extreme conditions in Antarctica to capture the life cycle of Emperor penguins on film, and their diligence is evident in every striking frame of this 80-minute documentary. It's beautiful shot, footage. March of the Penguins is a brilliant stirring and engaging nature film. Mad props to them, as they had to challenge of making the film when the weather was with windy 125 miles per hour temperatures between -50 and -60 °C. That's crazy cold! I had to put a coat on, just thinking about it. It has all the narrative excitement with the soothing voice of Oscar Winner, Morgan Freeman. If you are watching the French version of the film, the film has a first-person narrative as if the story is being told by the penguins themselves. The narration alternates between a female (Romane Bohringer) and a male (Charles Berling) narrator speaking the alternate roles of the female and male penguin, and as the chicks are born their narration is handled by child actor Jules Sitruk. I don't dislike this Anthropomorphism version, but I think hearing Morgan Freedom's voice make the film more mature. Having penguins have human voices make it seem like a nature film. I think the International dubbing as roles for the penguins is just don't have the ring for a documentary with a third-person narrative. Plus the international version have different titles that doesn't have the feel for the film such as the Philippine's version Penguin, Penguin, How Were You Made? Or India's Penguins: A Love Story. I will take 'March of the Penguins' title over these international titles that explain the harsh voyage the Penguins go through. Also I don't like the International's version of music choice of electronic too much. Its sounds too haunting rather than epic journey. Don't get me wrong, I like Émilie Simon, but songs like 'Frozen World' would sound better in a gritty fantasy movie. The music instrumental score by Alex Wurman is amazing. The only problem with his, is that the score track loops way too much in the film. I think the movie was very educating to people who wouldn't know anything about the species. Yes, it got a few things wrong like saying penguins are monogamous when in reality penguins are serial monogamy. The movie is great for both children and adults as it is Rated G, but still there are scenes of mating, violence, and sad moments of death due to Mother Nature's cold environment, and predators. So do warning. The movie was advertised as being so adorable and fun for the entire family, but that is simply not so. There were cute moments, and a couple of hoots, but for the most part it was just gloomy and depressing! Well, it didn't stop the movie from reaching the masses. The movie became so popular, that in 2007, a direct-to-DVD parody written and directed by Bob Saget called Farce of the Penguins was released. It is narrated by Samuel L. Jackson and features other stars providing voice-overs for the penguins. I wouldn't go see that crap movie by Bob Saget. Overall: Penguins are beautiful, amazingly emotional creatures and this movie help you understand what they go through, when in order to reproduce, which is a lot of hardship and misery. Don't look at them as an anthropomorphic depiction of penguins, but as normal animals trying to survive. Give it a go, you won't regret it."
209,March of the Penguins,8,16 December 2012,"Indeed, A March Forward","what made this nature documentary so good is probably due to some help from the french narration...it added some human touch to the penguins...to make them seem like they have the ability to think and emote their feelings, that some people might wonder whether there are actually humans inside those fur. However monotonous and 'boring' it may be, to my opinion no other form of narration can create such a powerful effect (and with standard) I am glad the creators made such a clever decision. Combined with that, getting to view a detailed account of their one-year cycle really allows you can really feel for these creatures so much that at times it can be painful to watch, but it is a good feeling that shows that we are not the only ones marching on with our lives."
210,March of the Penguins,8,12 April 2012,An Excellent Documentary!,"Morgan Freeman narrates this documentary about penguins in the Antartica or South Pole region where French scientists cover a year in their lives. The photography or cinematography is first rate and the documentary looks beautiful because of the scenery and it's characters which is a penguin colony. Here, the scientists observe and learn about the penguins' lives in the Antartica part of the world during the coldest weather. It's amazing to see Antartica so beautiful, so untouched nor destroyed by mankind to be allowed such crisp, clearness, clarity, pristine beauty, etc. Antartica should always be preserved and protected by the world. Anyway, the penguins are the major inhabitants. These beautiful creatures must endure harsh storms and predators seeking food. They are a community of parents and children where mothers and fathers leave their young to search for food in the ocean. It's an amazing voyage of watching the baby penguins grow and bond with their parents."
211,March of the Penguins,7,12 June 2011,The trials and tribulations a parent overcomes for the love of their child,"The March of the Penguins is an Academy Award winning documentary that tracks the voyage of the Emperor Penguin as they make their way to and from the ocean to their breeding ground. It is a remarkable tale of the continuation of a species. A theme throughout the film is that of the awe inspiring love of a parent to a child. No matter the species, the gift of life is a marvel and a thing to be cherished. The Emperor Penguins go through great trials in order to bring about the hatching of their young. They must travel many miles in harsh conditions to reach the breeding ground where they can safely lay their single egg. The father penguins must survive months with no food, huddled together to provide warmth to each other and protection to their eggs. Each father is responsible for the egg he harbors on his feet, beneath a fold of warm skin, while the mothers must make the trek back to the ocean in order to feed themselves and bring food back for their babies. The penguins must struggle against the elements, predators, and starvation. They struggle through these things, all in the hopes of a successful hatching.Morgan Freeman is the only human voice heard throughout the duration of the film. He expertly provides the narration needed to understand the movements of the penguins, and assists the viewer in understanding the harshness of Antarctica and the trials that the penguins go through. He provides interesting facts and details about Emperor Penguins that create a bond with the penguins, such as the fact that Emperor Penguins are monogamous, but only for the season. The March of the Penguins is similar to the 2007 documentary Artic Tale. Both movies focus of the lives of animal parents and their young as they struggle to live in the coldest parts of the world. Both show the trials that the animals face to ensure their survival and the possibility of future generations.The voyage of the penguins comes alive with the capabilities of the camera crew. Much of the film is shot from a subjective, eye level height. This really lets the viewer feel like they are in with the penguins and experiencing the harshness of the weather and the joy of the eggs hatching. Often, the camera zooms in on the penguins so the viewer can appreciate the beauty of the penguins and their surroundings. The camera takes a different angle when the long journey to and from the breeding ground is shown. In this case, it's more of an objective view looking down of the penguins as they make their single file march. The view scans out to see the vastness of the icy landscape and the extreme distance they must travel, all in order to create a new generation.Sound is also a key technique in establishing the bond between parent penguins and their young chicks. Before the father penguins leave the young chicks in their mother's care to head back to the ocean to feed after a four month fast, they sing to their babies and their babies sing back to them. This is the only way that they will recognize each other upon the father's return. It is amazing upon the fathers return, that through the chaos of all the penguins singing that each father can find what he is looking for, his chick. In the coldest place on earth, life remains. The Emperor Penguins continue to struggle and survive in order to create the greatest joy in life, a new life. Everything they do is for the benefit of their young chick. A parent's love can withstand harsh weather, fierce predators, and stress to their bodies in order to create a future for their children. The cycle of life continues."
212,March of the Penguins,9,31 March 2011,"Yeah, it's a movie about penguins. And yeah! It's gorgeous!","I had heard many good comments about this movie, so I decided to give it a chance, although I was quite skeptical. But this has been a very touching experience. An extraordinary tale about the survival of a species in a frozen hell. About some amazing behaviors that make it almost impossible not to think that these ""stupid birds"" have an utter sense of purpose in all what they do: how they march together to their breeding place; how they mate; how they share the burden of keeping their offspring alive. Congratulations to all the crew that made this film possible. Yes, I really enjoyed a documentary about penguins, and even seen it several times."
213,March of the Penguins,10,23 November 2010,Astounding,"March of the Penguins is a truly remarkable film, that wasn't helped by its misleading advertising. I admit I wasn't expecting what I saw, in fact it was better than what I was expecting. I loved the documentary style it was shot in. I loved the beautiful photography and the breathtaking sceneries. I loved the poignant and haunting music. I loved the cleverly written narration and thought that Morgan Freeman narrated perfectly. Asdides from the visuals were the penguins themselves, they were so cute and immediately lovable, then again I may biased as I love penguins. The film is quite leisurely in pace, but I liked that, it gave an elegiac and thoughtful feel to the film. In conclusion, March of the Penguins really is an astounding documentary-like film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
214,March of the Penguins,9,2 October 2010,A great film that had a misleading advertising campaign at the time of its release,"I really enjoyed this high-quality film about the life cycle of the emperor penguin. However, I believe the advertising campaign at the time of its release in 2005 was somewhat intentionally misleading. The cute pictures and even cuter lullaby-like music accompanying the TV ads would lead you to believe that you would be safe taking a kindergärtner to this film. Since the film accurately and starkly portrays the deaths that befall these creatures, I can't say that viewing by extremely young children is such a good idea. Instead, the level of violence on this film, although realistic and therefore not excessive, is more along the lines of what you would see on ""When Dinosaurs Roamed the Earth"" on the Discovery Channel. Thus, probably anyone over the age of 10 can take the death of these creatures in context and enjoy the film.That being said, it is great to see Hollywood put out such a high quality film and I agree with all of the other reviewers that Morgan Freeman did a five star job of narrating the movie. I hope that the movie's success motivates the motion picture industry to produce more intelligent films like this one that depict the animal life around us and understand that audiences are capable of appreciating and understanding films that do not involve car chases, explosions, bad remakes of 60's sitcoms, and life size robots whose limbs come with machine-gun attachments."
215,March of the Penguins,,1 September 2010,to build a narrative,"The beauty of Nature is how everything fits everything to build a coherent whole. the environment and its actors are one and the same, fully interdependent: they build each other. It's symbiotic and global warming allows dramatically to understand to each extent. So, the purpose of those who observe nature is to build a narrative that allows us to understand the mechanisms of Nature. To tell a small part of the story, that will fit in the larger context. That's what precedes this film and informs it: the narrative of the penguins in the process of reproduction. The trick is to establish that narrative pushing us to the middle of it, and making us face the animals not as an observed subject, but as true almost dramatically dense characters. In other words, what they do is deliver a documentary disguised as fiction.The idea by itself is appealing enough to create the enthusiasm that this film generated. Plus, it is remarkably well executed, from the quality of the cinematography, performed under rough circumstances, extreme temperatures and human adverse environments. the way this is put together is flawless, although the off voice narrations push a little too much on the fiction sentimentality for my taste.this narrative, of the penguins, is really pleasant for us to follow because the animal has a humanoid look to him. the boundaries between documentary and fiction are more easily crossed because so are the boundaries between these animals and our reality as humans.The place where penguins gather, where the babies are born, that is a special place, with an incredible strenght. I praise this filmmakers for conveying it so strongly. This was a worthy, powerful journey.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
216,March of the Penguins,10,23 March 2010,Penguins are marching towards the Oscar,"March of the penguins is in both ways funny and sad.This a story about march for the survival of Penguins.Beautifully directed,this movie is remarkable in itself.Love between penguins will surely leave you heavy hearted.How journey of a new born penguin begins?Journey of the mother penguin?Fight for the survival from various predators?The bonding between mother & father penguin?How penguins survive from freezing cold?This documentary is a masterpiece.You will come to know after watching it that nature is beautiful.Everything about the penguins is so unique.What more adds to the beauty is a fantastic narration done by Amitabh Bachan & Morgan Freeman.Though i have heard the narration of Amitabh Bachan.Its such a gripping narration.March of the Penguins surely is an Oscar material.That's why it has won the best documentary movie.Penguins rightfully are marching towards the Oscar & setting new barriers."
217,March of the Penguins,6,20 December 2009,"Sweet at times, brutal at others; March of the Penguins is an insightful and occasionally raw look at the good, the bad and the ugly of nature in a far off place.","For what it's worth, I actually learnt a thing or two about penguins when watching March of the Penguins, or 'La Marche de l'empereur' to give it its original, French title. I guess that's enough to grade it a success, isn't it? How do you grade a piece like this, anyway? 'La Marche de l'empereur'  the title, in French, makes it sound more important and more interesting than it actually is: 'La Marche de l'empereur  un film de Luc Jacquet' actually makes it sound even grander. Hey, I liked it overall; I think it's worth a watch, if only once. The sheer scale of the effort Jacquet and co. have put into this; in terms of hauling themselves over to the Antarctic in order to capture the simple, but very dangerous, lives and processes these birds known as penguins go through is truly a remarkable feat. However, the awe one has regarding these levels of dedication the crew had, as well as the picking up of a few details on how penguins live their lives for a set period of each year, are all the piece has to offer.Unfolded amidst the snowy nether-regions of absolutely nowhere, the piece tells the journey, of which is dressed up to look and sound like some sort of narrative of epic and scope, that sees hundreds of emperor penguins make the long and hard journey to a breeding ground so that their species may continue to exist. Once there, the process of having to find a mate; protect the egg of the chick and then that long wait as the females go all the way back to gather food in the form of fish, is explored and transfered from centuries old matter-of-fact to unfolding cinematic event. The penguins' sequence of journeying, reproducing and raising sounds a simple enough process; but months without nourishment, biting temperatures and severe weather complicates the procedure, thus creating natural difficulty which has been filtered through the system and rendered a source of antagonism for the cinema screen by Jacquet.There isn't much in March of the Penguins that elevates it above a made for television documentary on the subject. Indeed, it was funded by The National Geographic Society, whom I'm sure went into the project with the presumption that the natural beauty of rural locations as rarely seen and explored as the Antarctic will automatically qualify as 'cinematic'. Indeed, I read on the Internet that other versions of the piece have actors providing voice-over talent which is supposed to be representative of what the birds on screen are saying to one another. Here we see an instance attempting to render the whole experience more cinematic, by way of having characters and dialogue. But it's not enough, is it? The version I saw had Morgan Freeman keeping us up to date on exactly what it was they were doing without any bird-on-bird interaction. An early IMDb comment states that Frenchman Jacquet has 'done the impossible'. What, told us the process of what emperor penguins do during their species' time of reproduction? Hardly. What Jacques has achieved is the easily obtainable, only told amidst conditions which were extremely difficult-come-neigh on impossible.But there's a knowing sense that March of the Penguins identifies its place in that broad area of pieces that set out to inform; be they documentaries, docu-dramas or otherwise unclassifiable. Around about the same time of March of the Penguins' release, another piece entitled Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait was unleashed amongst the world; something that was additionally a celebration of an item or was desperately in love with its subject while additionally dedicated long passages of footage to mere observations of how this 'item' went about its business as the elements and everything else unfolded around them. At least we learnt something in March of the Penguins; at least we picked up on something about the process these magnificent beings go through when reacting to that natural calling to do what it is they do. If we learnt anything from the Zidane piece, it was that a bunch of frogs burst in Germany; there was a car bomb in Iraq and English actor Sir John Mills died. More interesting things were happening off-field, it would seem. Irony of all ironies that in a piece all about the celebration of footballer Zidane - the three minute segment in which the titular footballer was off screen was the most engaging passage of play.So I give March of the Penguins its due; it doesn't completely veer off down the wrong track and give us some kind of installation. Interestingly; for all the awe and wonder of the vast, expansive locale of the Antarctic, the things that are most interesting are the small, precise and more intimate actions the penguins must partake in: the shuffling of the newborn egg from the mother to the father's warmth; the minute rearranging of those on the outside with those on the inside so as to share the burden of the cold whilst in a huddle, as well as the frightening timing the females must exact when preparing to jump back up onto the surface to evade predators when swimming for fish to catch. The piece is a tale of survival, and a pretty harrowing one at that; while it is a tale of realisation, and the taking on of certain responsibilities - again, a pretty harrowing one at that. The film's attention to nature as one long large cycle, which, no matter how absurd can get; is something that must be repeated over and over is duly got across. The notion of nature fighting nature in the weather being a factor and other kinds of animals wanting to destroy the penguins' process are explored and executed with a surprising amount of dramatic weight. It's well shot and well executed, while on a rare occasion, the 'best of'/outtake moments over the end credits should not produce a collective groan."
218,March of the Penguins,,12 November 2009,Of Penguins and Men: A DVD review,"The drip-feed of liquid saccharine begins its work on the Warner Home Video DVD even before the main menu pops up, with trailers for The Polar Express and Happy Feet, a short CGI animation of a baby penguin galumphing to Stevie Wonder's 'I Wish'. If you're not already bloated with bonhomie and aching to procreate by the time Stevie and babykin have wibbled off, Warners hope you will be by the time you're done with the extras package.First up, a 54-minute documentary from the courageous (aka lunatic) makers of March Of The Penguins called 'Of Penguins and Men'. Here, director Luc Jacquet describes how the filmmakers first came across the rambler birds during their 13 month venture into the Antarctic. ""I'm so moved that my hands are shaking"" recalls the narrator, who may also have been feeling the pinch of the sub-degree temperatures; it took the cinematographers half an hour just to put on the six layers of clothing required to stay alive every day.On their arrival, the trusting penguins march straight up to the camera and start wittering, singing, dancing and screwing like upper class twits at an Oxbridge ball. You can almost hear the adults pushing their teenage brood toward the lenses, crying ""Dance! Dance for mummy! We'll be over by that ice floe, coupling acrobatically."" It's a slightly redundant exercise given you've already seen much of this footage in the movie proper. Nevertheless, the scenery is always breathtaking, with its ice cathedrals looming over all.Ah, but nature is a feisty mistress: the lensmen (whose often blighted journey parallels their subjects) caught crippling frostbite and nearly died during a three-week snowstorm: sod the birds, get me out of here. On the less portentous side, we also see the crew messin' about with helium. ""It makes you sound like a duck!"" Next up, 'National Geographic's Crittercam: Emperor Penguins', hosted by a burbling American called Dr Mike Heithaus, a severe inflectionitis sufferer. Mike shows how a device, previously used on whales and dolphins, is attached to penguin called Rodney, by scientists monitoring the ravages of global warming. The Crittercam, says Mike, is ""worn by species on the edge!"" The results make astonishing viewing, as little Rodders plunges beneath the freezing waters, reaching those parts scientists can't (or would rather not) reach. The obligatory snuff scene comes care of a prowling leopard seal. ""Trapped in the leopard's jaw, it's checkmate for this emperor!"" Oh, Mike.Finally, an there is old cartoon bunged on the end. But this isn't any old cartoon: it's a classic Merry Melodies short from the great Chuck Jones. In '8 Ball Bunny', Bugs finds a lost top-hatted penguin (""It's a boid in a tuxedo!"") and attempts to return him to the South Pole. It's a measure of how ultimately unsatisfying the extras are that, beside the main feature, this is the highlight of the DVD - and that someone at Warners has a sense of humour."
219,March of the Penguins,10,19 April 2009,I love it!,"March of the Penguins Summary March of the Penguins was a riveting documentary on the love life, and reproductive life of the beautiful emperor penguin. This documentary led us through the nine months that it takes for two adult emperor penguins to produce and raise a penguin chick in Antarctica. The journey starts when summer is coming to a close in march, and both male and female penguins leave the sea, and make a seventy mile march to their breeding grounds. Once at the breeding grounds, all of the penguins search for their mate. No one knows what the penguins are looking for in a partner, but in a few weeks they have all found one. They will then mate with their selected mate. Over the next few months, the female penguin will lose as much as one third of her body weight producing the egg. Once she has produced the egg, she passes it off to her male partner and returns to the sea to replenish her famished belly. Throughout the entire winter, every mating male emperor penguin will huddle together for warmth, protecting their eggs. Once the winter ends, the females return and take over the care of their newly hatched chick. The males, having lost as much as half their body weight, will now make the trip back to the ocean to feed themselves. Throughout the next few months, the parents will take turns caring for the chick and returning to the see. Finally at the beginning of the summer, all of the adult penguins will leave their young and return to the sea for three months of feeding playing and relaxing. The chicks will remain on the ice for a few more weeks while they grow stronger and then they themselves will enter the sea and live there for four years before they themselves will participate in this beautiful mating cycle.Themes A main theme throughout this film was how human-like the producer made the penguins seem. The penguins showed intense emotion and intimacy that the viewer had no idea existed in the lives of an emperor penguin. These human like actions gave the viewer a strong attachment to the penguins so when the penguins felt pain and despair so did the viewer. This film did a wonderful job of capturing the viewers interest and emotions.Filmmakers other work The film maker Luc Jacquet only has one other major work, The Fox and the Child. This film also is strongly nature related and it too gives the viewer a strong connection with the characters, a girl and a fox.Subjects The subjects in this film were emperor penguins. The film focused almost solely on their beautiful love lives and mating cycles of the penguins. There was also the occasional predator of the penguins throughout the film.Editing The editing was inspiring. Almost all of the footage in March of the Penguins was actual footage of the amazing emperor penguins going about their mating cycle, and the beautiful icy landscape of Antarctica. It was edited so everything flowed smoothly from happiness to struggles to sadness and back to happiness again.Music The music in March of the Penguins was great! I loved it. The mood of the soothing music directly related with what was going on in the film. Happy, bouncy music was used for good times. Slow mysterious music was used for the struggles. Sad, slow, and smooth music was used during the times of sadness. The music and visuals were put together beautifully.My Opinion I absolutely loved this film. It is a wonderful story of an amazing adventure that takes place every year in Antarctica. This documentary is wonderful for any audience and I think that everyone should see it at least once in their lives."
220,March of the Penguins,10,1 March 2009,Dutch (and French) version has much better music and songs!,"Even though the English version has very good music, the Dutch (and French) versions have much better and UNFORGETTABLE music and songs, by Emilie Simon. ""I want to live in Paradise"" is simply unforgettable. I watched English version only couple of times, and I ended up watching only Dutch version about ten (10) times afterward because of the music art and how it relates to the movie. True Art, Emilie Simon. Even the sounds of Emilie Simon and her music truly and appropriately go along with the documentary. I only wish that I had English narration to go along with Dutch (or French) version. Also, English version is too politically correct: it does not show other aspects of Penguin's life. Dutch is not afraid to show more - only making Dutch version more unforgettable."
221,March of the Penguins,10,13 January 2009,A Great Documentary That Adjectives Can't Properly Describe,"Funny. Sad. Hopeful. Inspiring. Those are just a few of the adjectives that come to mind after watching this brilliantly produced documentary about the life cycle of the Emperor Penguins of Antarctica. The photography in the movie is absolutely beautiful, offering spectacular glimpses of the Antarctic's snow-swept landscape and giving a real feel for what life in Antarctica must be like - although I suppose sitting in the warmth of a comfortable house watching this isn't exactly like being out in the open in -80 degree temperatures! Wonderfully narrated by Morgan Freeman, the movie offers us a year of penguin life, as the males travel seventy miles from the ocean to breed, then take turns with the females marching back and forth to the ocean to feed as they in turn care for the eggs and then the young. (Watching the ""march"" I came to realize the need of cartoonists to portray these animals as little guys in tuxedos - in the distance shots that open the film they really do look like people on the march.) We see the dangers involved from hunger, the elements and predators and - while it may be based mostly on instinct - we also see a level of commitment and a sense of responsibility in these birds that one only wishes could be seen more often in human beings. A truly enjoyable movie to sit down with. 10/10"
222,March of the Penguins,,4 December 2008,March of the Penguins Film Review,"""In some ways this is a story of survival, a tale of life over death, but it's more than that really  this is a story about love."" This line in Morgan Freeman's opening narration, despite other critic's remarks of ""they're just birds"", becomes an evidently true theme throughout watching March of the Penguins. This is in fact what inspired Luc Jacques to make this film more than just a documentary. In an interview with National Geographic News, he says that he wanted to ""get out of the documentary genre"" and tell the story, not from a scientist's view, but as he felt it.Before becoming a director, Jacques was a French biologist. His interests in penguins arose when he spent 14 months at the French scientific center in Antarctica doing research. He had also spent time as a cameraman filming for the movie Congress of the Penguins. Here he fell in love with the beauty of Antarctica and realized what a great movie the story of the penguins would make. He says, ""The story as all the elements of great drama  love, life, death.""The movie reveals over a years time the breeding cycle of the emperor penguin. When they leave their natural habitat of the ocean and arrive at their breeding ground on thick sheltered ice, it is time to mate. By charming with their own unique songs, they find only one mate to be committed to for the next year, all hopefully resulting in a healthy chick. After two months, when the female lays her egg, she carefully passes it on to the father, who will take care of it for the next two months while the mother makes a long voyage back to the open water to get food for herself and her chick. It isn't an easy two months for any of them. The fathers rely on each other for warmth and protection from the fierce cold and storms that will come their way. The mothers, who are almost starving, have to walk many miles and face the dangers of exhaustion and predators, such as the leopard seal. Near the end of the two months, the young penguin chicks hatch, and the father feeds them the little food he still has deposited just for this time. If the mother doesn't return in time, the father, who has now been four months without food, will have to abandon his chick to find food for himself. However, when the mother does return, the father quickly exchanges the chick to it's mother to get food and to bond. For the next few months this becomes a routine, each parent taking turns to watch the chick while the other gets food. As the ice melts and the open water becomes closer and closer, the trips become more frequent. All this time does not go without danger and adventure. Each day is a new risk, as fierce storms and predators take the lives of parents and chicks. There is obvious despair for a mother whose chick dies; sometimes they even try to steal another's chick. Eventually the chicks will become strong enough to fend for themselves, and they will all go back to the sea. This is where the story ends until it is time to breed again.It really isn't your ordinary documentary. With the elements of the music, the photography, and the narration, you really can't look at these penguins as just as animal. Their story hits close to home because the makers weren't trying to give you just information. They intentionally gave us a true story in nature that we could relate to. The music in the film is exactly what you'd expect to hear in an epic romantic film. It's all instrumental, and it's all filled with emotion. The music editors did a great job in making sure it fit. Not every scene had music. There were scenes of storms where all you could hear was the wind howling. It really made you feel like you were there because you can hear and see the intensity of it. The cinematographers were Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison, who spent a lot of time out in the cold with the penguins; so much that they both endured some severe frostbite in the process of filming. There were a few different ways they used to film what was going on. Sometimes it was filmed from far away, from just an outsider's perspective, but other times it was so close that it really feels as if you're right there with the penguins, a part of their colony. The narration also attributed to the feel of actually being there. Instead of giving the scientific facts and reasons, they narration allowed you to imagine just what the penguins might be feeling or thinking. Obviously, the penguins can't talk and tell you what's going on in their heads, but it's a refreshing new perspective to imagine that they might actually have emotions like we do. While there are times, I'm sure, that the penguin's life can be very boring (it's probably difficult to make a whole year in an animal's life exciting), the editors made sure that the important aspects of the cycle were there, and I didn't feel like I missed very much in the 100 minutes the year had been compressed to. Overall, I enjoyed this film much more than I expected to, but it shouldn't surprise me. The film was the 2nd most successful documentary next to Fahrenheit 9/11 in America, and was nominated and received many awards. So, if you're ever in the mood for some educational drama, March of the Penguins is an excellent film."
223,March of the Penguins,9,25 August 2008,A remarkable and informative look at a remarkable creature!,"I love animals - most of us do - and penguins for me rank right up there with my cat (Mel Gibson) and giraffes.The version I just watched was narrated by Morgan Freeman - an actor I have enormous respect and affection for - filmed in perhaps the harshest place on earth to live - Antartica.What really amazed me about the titular Emperor Penguins in this documentary is how amazingly ""human"" they behave - in the good ways not the bad. They show signs of affection for each other I am not aware of in many other species - let alone a flightless bird - and their children remind me a lot of human kids.They are also - at least as adults - quite a beautiful bird. True they are seemingly ungainly on terra-firma but once they hit the H2O they are like angels of the sea.This documentary is beautifully filmed with sublime audio and music. It must have been an extremely tough shoot for the crew. The narration is expertly written and entertaining to David Attenborough degree.A remarkable film about a unique creature and highly recommended - especially if you love animals and documentaries about them. It is for animals like the Emperor Penguin we all need to more to protect the environment so the magic of these amazing birds is not forever lost."
224,March of the Penguins,8,2 July 2008,Very good.,"Firstly - do not watch this film if you do not like penguins or do not like documentaries. Otherwise you will be severely disappointed. I love both these things and that is why I love this film.Basically, this film explains the life of the emperor penguins: their 70 mile march to their breeding ground, the way the father keeps his egg warm during freezing winter and the way that the penguin chicks grow up. I have only watched the Morgan Freeman version and he narrates beautifully. The main reason to watch this is for the learning experience, the narration and the penguin chicks, who melt your heart.This film is better than Happy Feet.Enjoy ""March of the Penguins""! :-) P.S The photography is also spectacular."
225,March of the Penguins,10,24 January 2008,fascinating look at the Emperor Pengiun of Antartica,"this documentary is a great look at the life of the Emperor Penguins,who live in Antarctica,which is said to be the harshest climate on the planet.it details their march to their breeding ground,which is the same each year.sadly,not all of the penguins will survive the march.many will perish on the journey there.these creatures really have to persevere in order to survive the journey.the film also looks at what they go through to survive the harsh winter.but there are also some touching moments,including some courtship scenes,and some humorous moments,as well.there is also sadness and heartbreak for these creatures.given the conditions,it's a wonder the penguins have continued to survive all these years.i should also mention Morgan Freeman as the narrator.his voice fits perfectly with the movie.all in all,this is an informative,entertaining and touching portrayal of life continuing on in the face of almost insurmountable odds."
226,March of the Penguins,7,16 August 2007,An interesting way of doing a movie/documentary,"""La Marche de l'empereur"" is an ambitious and different kind of movie. Through a documentary shot in Antarctica, not only they made a movie about animals. Instead of dogs and cats, this time the animals are penguins.This is an original movie not just for being a documentary about penguins, but also because it is spoken in french, one of the most charming languages in the world. The narrators and artists do a wonderful voice work with this ""La Marche de l'empereur"". It was co-produced by Bonne Pioche and (guess what!) the National Geographic Society.Penguins are cute and beautiful animals, but with this movie you can also relax and admire the beauty of Antarctica, a place full of nothing but ice deserts and often considered «the end of the world».Beautiful sceneries and some magical details in the sky are also present, as well as the good soundtrack.Because this is a documentary film, it is absolutely realistic. There's nothing fictional about it. All we see is real. The journey of the penguins to survive, what they go through to protect their chicks, the way how they stand the weather and the nature's though conditions is admirable. Even so, some of them do not survive and these are the sad moments about this film. Through this, it also shows us the dark side of these animals's lives.Despite the fact that this can be classified as a film, it isn't totally a movie... well, at least in the traditional sense. Overall, this is a different kind of movie experience. And it serves both as a documentary and as a film."
227,March of the Penguins,10,1 August 2007,Magical and Magnificent,"What penguins do for their unborn is an inspiring lesson to all of us. To be able to over live an ice storm of minus 60 C out in the open polar night is nothing less of a miracle. The social mechanism of this magnificent creature is so well developed, and we humans..uh well, WW1 and 2 and Irak and......!! No wonder that this magnificent and highly sophisticated specie, walks a hundred miles on the scattered ice to lay their eggs and hatch, under extreme conditions, without food for as long as months, undergoing a 50% weight loss diet on the way. All that to be in peace and harmony (and away from civilization?).The icy unspoiled continent of Antarctica is beautiful and enchanting, a candy for the eye. A true masterpiece."
228,March of the Penguins,10,27 May 2007,Stirring Documentary,"This is one of the few documentaries that doesn't wear on viewers for many reasons, one being the narration. Since I'm from the U.S., I'm blessed with listening to the voice of Morgan Freeman while he weaves the story of the Emperor Penguin mating routine. When this first came out many thought, ""Aw, cool, Penguins!"", I thought, ""Aw, cool. Morgan Freeman!"" Beyond narration was the camera shots and angles taken in the film, every blink of the penguin looked majestic and beautiful. While most shots are at a distance, for the safety of the animals, the many close ups and horizon shots bring out the beauty of the Antarctic.This movie was made to give incite to audiences to the birth of penguins. This is a movie that should be seen in a double feature with another Warner Brothers film, Happy Feet. While both include How Emperor Penguins are born, the both have the similar, ""Save the Penguins,"" feel.Bottom Line, this is a movie all can enjoy, whether your a nature nerd, drama dork, or laughing fool, this movie has sweet moments and amazing knowledge of the mating rituals of the Emperor Penguin."
229,March of the Penguins,6,25 May 2007,Slightly Disappointing,"I am told I have a slightly odd obsession with penguins and so had been looking forward to seeing this for some time. It is good when a documentary manages to break into the mainstream and gets seen by large numbers of people.Which is where March has its appeal. It is not a heavy handed documentary with lots of detail. Which may please some but I found slightly disappointing.Morgan Freeman's narration is easy to listen to but I have to say is not the most captivating I've ever heard. And I felt that some parts were overly emotive and strayed too far from the boundaries of objectivity.I was also dismayed at the 'dumbing down' of information, which I presume is to attract a younger audience. There is a great lack of any technical information, or much information at all that the relatively well informed adult would not already know or be able to find out in 5 minutes on the internet.The epitome of this for me was the line that went something like 'the egg appeared' - come on, an egg does not 'appear'! However, visually the film is stunning and is worth watching for that alone.I would say that this is worth a watch but not one to be added to the DVD collection as I can't imagine returning for a second viewing."
230,March of the Penguins,10,29 April 2007,So Beautiful!,"Since I saw Happy Feet, penguins are animals I like a lot. And so I rented this movie. If you want my opinion, La Marche de l'empereur is one of the best documentaries that you can see. No wonder it went to the Oscars, and actually won! The reason why I gave this title to my comment is that the images were actually really beautiful. From underwater to the nice continents of Antartica, the images are beautiful. I saw the film in English and French (I live in Québec city), and the narrators are excellent (Morgan Freeman was excellent. 2 thumbs up). The baby penguins were so cute. Yet, when one of them gets eaten by one of those skuas, both me and my sister were on the edge of crying. Anyhow, if you are searching a good documentary, March of the Penguins (or La Marche de l'empereur), is a really good and beautiful documentary. Just be ready with some Kleenex boxes because some parts are so emotional that you might be crying and crying. Have a good movie!"
231,March of the Penguins,10,25 March 2007,Absolutely remarkable,"I have just watched The March of the Penguins for the fourth time in seven days, and I can honestly say that I have never been so impressed by a piece of natural history documentary film making. Morgan Freeman's narration could probably only have been better had Richard Burton still been available, and the standard of achievement by the film crew, who themselves had to endure the incredibly harsh Antarctic winter, was quite astounding.There are those who, I must say, have quite cynically slayed this film, but surely they must be in the minority. The pain, the agony, the pathos, the humour and the sheer expansiveness of this film surely merits the highest praise.10 out of 10 barely does this film justice, and I look forward to more of this standard from the same makers."
232,March of the Penguins,9,4 March 2007,a great documentary,"It was a masterpiece from start to finish. Morgan Freeman was also great. If you don't like this film, you're wrong!! March of the Penguins is the movie that people need. So you should watch the movie because you would love it. This movie certainly had marvelous cinematography and is a good experience. It's better known for the best seat in the house. Please see the film, because it's very educational and heartwarming. It shows a way a life that's very beautiful and yet includes struggle. Penguins are just so beautiful in this movie masterpiece. All I can say is to watch this film of desolate Arctic beauty."
233,March of the Penguins,10,4 March 2007,"In My opinion, THE BEST of it's kind!","Being a camera operator and editor, I just wonder how much time, patience and knowledge it would take to make something like this. It's something you don't get to see everyday. The sound mixture is another perfect achieve. The soundtrack also receives 10 stars from me, specially being made from the same person (Emilie Simon). Iv'e seen the original version, in french and the narrator it's adequate to the scenes. I Recommend this to everyone, specially the ""nature lovers"". Every scene in this documentary looks like a postcard frame! The only thing I this it's missing is some more scenes when the male penguins go on their journey after the female arrives. JUST LOVED IT! And can't think how not to like this!"
234,March of the Penguins,8,4 January 2007,Your life sucks if you're a penguin in this great exploration,"Boy, the French are good at documentaries about animals, first Winged Migration and then this look at the Emperor penguin suffering through the brutal winter in Antarctica. Having seen Happy Feet before I watched this I was amazed at how much of the story Happy Feet incorporated, several scenes were almost wholesale ripped out of the movie. The main message I got was ""I'm glad I'm not a penguin"" Did you know that the males go more than 3 months with no food and many perish from starvation on the 70 mile walk back to the water. 70 miles, with little short penguin legs and nasty wind. This was an excellent exploration of penguin life, making it much more gripping than I would have thought possible. I kept thinking, life is brutal, life is mean, and if it weren't so common it would be utterly heartrending. Poor penguins were losing their eggs, their mates, their babies and their own lives in the struggle for propagation. Some are driven to madness from the grief. All is narrated by Morgan Freeman (in the English version) as we come to know and love these odd birds.This movie is like roast penguin (I'm just kidding), it is like sushi. It is an acquired taste and not for everyone. It is delicate, raw and unembellished. The tang from the wasabi adds intensity. The thought of raw fish can be disturbing but is enjoyable when eaten. Fish is loaded in nutrients and is one of the healthiest parts of the diet. We should all eat more fish. 8/10http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"
235,March of the Penguins,10,25 October 2006,let's make this movie to IMDb 250 top movies,"I assumed this movie is the best documenter movie of all time. It should be put on the 250 top IMDb movies. This has good story for all parents and children. How great their struggle to raise the chick is very moving, sad and beautiful. I watched this movie with all my family, we laugh when they jump from cold deep ice to the surface, how they walk and searching for their couples. It also sad when we saw male and female penguins cooperate together to lay their eggs and walk many miles to search food for their stock and see them eaten by sea lion or starving to death. The director, crew (especially cinematographer) is brilliant to capture this moment and also they have to struggle with cold weather. Good narration and good story for all people to more save animal."
236,March of the Penguins,8,19 September 2006,Fascinating film but a little too long,"As interesting as this story is, it really could have been better told in an hour. It seems it was only stretched out to make it suitable for theater rather than TV presentation.Morgan Freeman was a poor choice to narrate the English version of this film. Freeman may be a fine character actor but his delivery of the narrative in this film leaves much to be desired. His diction and clarity are lacking and the film suffers somewhat from his voice over. The photography is amazing. The location production crew is to be commended for coming back with beautiful pictures under the most adverse of physical conditions. How they were able to live on the ice and track all those penguins and get the cameras to work under such extremes is a technical miracle. The underwater shots by way of ""critter cam"" were incredibly good and provide an insight to the undersea world of the penguins never before attained. The documentary included on the DVD about the making of the film is as interesting as the feature itself. Overall, a worthwhile film but not one I would choose to see again - especially with Freeman's narration."
237,March of the Penguins,9,24 August 2006,French Version of March of Penguins,"At first time I watched this movie from the air plane, I was so moved to purchase this movie for my family. I decided to buy French version. The version I watched in the airplane was specially adapted version. Because the narration of French version is much better than English one, they have three narrators pretending papa, mama, and kid.I'd like to purchase French version of this movie from amazon.ca. It is the only place French version is sold.Web site tells nothing about subtitle. I called them but they can not tell whether it comes with an English subtitle or not. They only can tell from the info from web page. Is there anybody who watched French version of regular DVD and knows whether it comes with an English subtitle ?Then I commit to buy one. I don't simply want to watch only scenes if I had no subtitle one. We want to enjoy the entirety what Luc Jacquet intended for audiences."
238,March of the Penguins,10,18 August 2006,I warmly recommend this movie,"I can find only one word to describe this movie: Marvellous! I would recommend it not only to animal lovers but to anyone who appreciates and is conscious of the significant impact of nature in our lives. The struggle of the Emperor penguins to survive is awesome! I also watched the bonus track and was particularly amazed to see the efforts made by the crew who managed to bring this project to life. I believe they are admirable. They even compared themselves to the penguins considering that, in order to shoot this film, they too had to leave their families for a whole year having to suffer from the terrible weather inclemencies of Antarctica, to the point of even risking their lives.Please do go an see this movie and don't forget to bring your family with you, particularly if you have children. It's a decision you won't regret and an experience you'll never forget."
239,March of the Penguins,10,14 August 2006,"Clarification about ""why they breed so far away"" as asked by so many users.","I saw it in English yesterday (too late to see I know).A lot of users wrote in their comments that it was never explained why Penguins breed so far away - 70 miles off the shore.The reason, as narrated by Morgan Freeman, is that in summer ice melts and almost all of that 70 miles turns into water. This can of course be very dangerous for the new born if they slip into the sea without being ready for it. As you can see towards the end of the movie, the sea shore is just some yards away from the breeding ground. This is just one of nature's intelligent things. If the penguins breed, say 10 miles of the shore, the new borns would drown! I hope that helps."
240,March of the Penguins,7,13 August 2006,it's cold out there,"This is a charming and beautifully shot documentary. You cannot help be captured by the remarkable Emperor penguins and their fight for life.The natural backdrop of the antarctic is breathtaking and the harshness of the winter heightens your admiration for these creatures. The commentary though I found distracting and a bit cute, having been brought up with ""wildlife on one"" and the master David Attenborough the script here was not as informative as it could have been. That said, I watched this on DVD and the making of which had a significant amount of the film's footage in it was much better, being narrated by the the men that made it. It is when you watch this account of the journey from both the penguins and filmmakers position that you realise how awful the conditions are. In one scene we are shown the true carnage one of the storms causes, with the ground strewn with the dead bodies of the chicks, a very moving moment.So all in all this is well worth buying on DVD, so one can sit and wonder at the world in which we live in."
241,March of the Penguins,7,31 May 2006,Stunning documentation: MARCH OF THE PENGUINS.,"Awesome and astonishing National Geographic feature narrated by Morgan Freeman. Every year, in the pitiless and inhospitable Antartic terrain, thousands of Emperor penguins march in single file to the site they were born. These flightless birds are aquatic, but they will not swim...instead they will constantly march as far as 70 miles to pick a mate and breed. The male will endure the bitter cold and blowing snows for over four months guarding their egg while the female goes to the ocean in search of food. Some of the chicks will not survive, but those that do will return five years later sustaining the cycle of life.Amazing photography chronicles this inspiring true-life tale of devotion and fortitude touched with humor and sorrow. MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is wholesome entertainment for all ages."
242,March of the Penguins,5,22 May 2006,"Good but watch ""of penguins & men""","A bewitching insight into a world within our world.The documentary follows the mating ritual of the Emperor Penguin in Antartica. It shows them finding mates, losing eggs and baby penguins and the battle against the cold.The version I watched had Morgan Freeman's narration. It was a little heavy handed and for some reason too keen to describe the loss of eggs/penguins as anything other than death.The filming is awesome, and the DVD also has a bonus WB cartoon! I would however recommend the documentary ""of penguins & men"" which follows the 2 french men who made the film. This is much more interesting and engaging but covers very much the same ground as the film."
243,March of the Penguins,6,16 April 2006,more of a crowd pleaser,"In the harshest place on earth, where no other life exists, the emperor penguin makes its way to their breeding ground. The penguins pair off to mate, then prepare for the harsh winter. Basically after the egg is laid, the courtship ends, with the female leaving for food, entrusting the male to protect the egg during the winter months. The penguins endure so much tribulations, though with the new life it brings the suffering seems justiciable.What really makes this documentary so special? All this has been on TV documentaries before, in much deeper detail than what Luc Jacquet has presented. March of the Penguins is a soggy biscuit of a documentary, lacking in a lot of depth for what a documentary should have. What you could call the 'dry' aspect; the scientific facts, are minimal, which would have added thickness and information to absorb. March of the Penguins is more of a crowd pleaser, than a brilliant documentary people are hailing it to be. Luc Jacquet relies to heavily on the awe factor, the cuteness of the baby chicks, and the beauty of the penguins. In that regard it's quite mesmerising, with broad cinematography capturing the harshness of the ice laden land.Morgan Freeman has to stop doing voice overs. His voice does have that iconic factor, it so recognisable, yet his narration really degrades the experience of this film. He sounds so bland and monotoned, there's no hint of enthusiasm. Every sentimental aspect feels exaggerated and over blown, not much subtlety is happening.By no means a great documentary, yet still a wonderful experience."
244,March of the Penguins,8,4 April 2006,"Very good, but an inferior remake of an extraordinary BBC documentary","I was very moved by ""March of the Penguins"" in 1993 when it was called ""Life in the Freezer"". I jest, of course (though not really). Alastair Fothergill's ""Life in the Freezer"" was an extraordinary David Attenborough-hosted, multi-part BBC documentary on Antarctica, and what comprised a major part of it was the annual March of the Penguins. Everything that happens in ""March"" happened first -- and with a better score by George Fenton -- in ""Life in the Freezer"". It irritates me that few reviewers have ever credited ""Life"" with inspiring ""March"" (which it surely did). Fothergill's documentary had a haunting, majestic quality to it, and painted Antarctica as an alien, sometimes hostile, sometimes Eden-like environment. It focused on the hardships of life on the continent, as does ""March"", but its voice-over was more ironic and peppered with jaw-dropping factual information. I like ""March"" very much, but it is still the offspring of a superior parent."
245,March of the Penguins,7,5 February 2006,Unbelievable footage of something so unique,"I have just sat down and taken the time to watch this film and I would recommend anyone else to do the same.It's not fast moving. It's not action packed. It can even be pretty slow during certain scenes with shots used for what feels like an inordinate amount of time, and possibly sometimes the feel that the film is relying too heavily on what is a very 'pleasant' classical soundtrack.What I would say is stick with it. It drags you in. The footage is real and is truly remarkable. Just remember that if you feel a lack of emotion at any part of the documentary.It's an educational and fascinating insight into the life of a bird I realise I knew nothing about."
246,March of the Penguins,7,4 February 2006,Original version much better !,"I am surprised of the success garnered by the documentary in the USA. Of course, the story is touching and humorous at times, the penguins cute, the landscapes amazing, but I was going to see this movie hoping to hear the voices of some great French actors, as well as the amazing soundtrack of Emilie Simon !! I purchased the soundtrack and the songs are actually in English, so I don't really understand why it was removed. Instead the music of the American version is quite dull, and the entire story is told by Morgan Freeman, so it is much more boring than it would have been with different actors speaking in the names of the penguins as in the French version :("
247,March of the Penguins,7,29 January 2006,Lovely.,"Review of US version.March of the Penguins is a documentary about Penguins. Think National Geographic: the motion picture. This is the only way to summarize the film and based on what I just wrote I doubt even half of the people reading this review will even consider watching this movie. Sure penguins are cute and cuddly but do we really want to spend money to watch an hour and a half-long film about birds? Isn't that what PBS is for? Well yes but that's no excuse not to watch March of the Penguins.The story (if you can call it that) revolves around how emperor penguins find their mates, breed and raise their children. It may sound boring (and at times it is) but the whole cycle is actually pretty interesting if not a bit too complicated. Basically they come out of the water, march in a line all the way to their sacred breeding grounds, find mates, spend weeks guarding an egg then throughout the next few months the male and female penguins take turns walking all the way back for food. I can't find it in myself to understand why they just don't ""do it"" by the water where the food is or at least a little bit closer anyway. I know they mentioned the thick ice and the cliffs to block the wind a bit but they looked pretty damn cold as it is so how much harm could a bit more wind do them? Alas I'm rambling about the reasoning power of a few thousand feathered bipeds.March of the Penguins is crammed full of many interesting facts. I think I know just about everything about penguins having seen this film. They are interesting birds and this movie shows it. I admit it lags a lot in the middle when the birds continue going back to the ocean but I really didn't expect them to glamorize a real life breeding cycle just because it's a theatrical release. Other than that I was awake the whole time and much more I wasn't bored. This may have been aided by the fact that the film is narrated by Morgan Freeman. Between this and War of the Worlds I have to say that the guy is a natural. His voice matches the monotone National Geographic feel though it almost demands you to stay awake...I sure hope I'm not over-analyzing this.If you haven't already guessed March of the Penguins is a very well put together documentary. I don't mind saying that since there's really nothing wrong with it and in some ways it's really quite amazing. The filmmakers have captured so many fantastic images. At some points I was wondering if it was real or just really good CGI. I just find it really hard to believe that none of this film was doctored even a bit. Take the underwater footage for example. We can clearly see multiple shots of penguins whizzing through the water like torpedoes and we also see a seal catch one in it's mouth. This is some truly amazing stuff.So I guess there's not a heck of a lot more to say about March of the Penguins. Sure I could go on and on about the facts I learned but knowing those would ruin your enjoyment of the film greatly. Speaking of enjoyment, I'd very much like to recommend this film to everybody but that's just not going to happen. Penguins aren't ""cool"" and neither are documentaries. There are a lot of cold people out there who can't find it in themselves to swallow their pride and watch a documentary about penguins. Nothing I say about this film will get people to watch this movie which is really quite a shame since they don't know what they're missing.My review from Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=penguins"
248,March of the Penguins,6,20 January 2006,The Film They Didn't Make Would Have Been More Interesting,"The most fascinating thing about ""March of the Penguins"" is how the film making crew shot their amazing footage of these amazing animals in one of the harshest regions of the earth. During the closing credits, we finally get a glimpse of what went in to actually making the movie, and unfortunately, we realize that the making of ""March of the Penguins"" would probably make a better documentary than the documentary itself.As for the movie Luc Jaquet DID make, whether or not you like it will depend greatly on how tickled you are by lingering shots of penguins waddling or, in some cases, just standing around. The film decides to focus on the ""family"" aspect of the penguins' mating life, how they actually mate and stay with one partner and care for their children under seemingly impossible conditions. No wonder the Christian coalition jumped all over this movie. Sadly though, in taking this approach, the film makers leave you with more questions about penguins than they answer, and the penguins themselves turn out to be not as interesting or personable as the brief clips you've seen of them here and there might suggest. And I don't know why millions of people seemed to think this movie was so heartwarming. It's depressing, actually; penguins have a crappy time of it.This is a bland, very safe documentary of the variety you might see on PBS. It's pretty to look at, but unchallenging in every other way.Grade: B-"
249,March of the Penguins,1,3 December 2005,An over sympathetic narrative glorifying the two or three things that happen in the typical penguin life.,"Simply put, very boring. Great though if you're looking for a chick flick. The narrative approach the writers took on this film is to inject all of what would be normal penguin activities with sappy human emotions. The film tries to portray Penguins as divine creatures with thoughts, feelings, emotions, and opinions. The one great thing about this movie is that you may feel an overwhelming sense of excitement and appeasement once you finally see the credits begin to roll. This is a documentary akin to the Discovery Channel, only done by Greenpeace-esquire Penguin activists. The best thing about the film is the underwater footage of the penguins searching for food. This was impressive . The worst part of the film was the constant camera angle of the Penguin eye, trying to capture the sadness, or whatever other sappy emotions the directors wish the audience to believe was going through the mind of the penguin, which has the same IQ as the temperature in which they live."
250,March of the Penguins,1,9 December 2005,Not a movie!,"Yesterday evening I went to the cinema to see a good movie at the sneak preview. Unfortunately this movie was shown. Most of the people didn't even make it through the only 65 minutes this clip lasts. I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the penguins and their habitat. The breathtaking story of the march is narrated in a funny way, but it was not annoying. Still, I went to the cinema to see a movie, and not this. It looks like a good documentary which are regularly shown on Animal Planet. I hope never to have to sit through another one of those documentaries, because at the end half the audience was sleeping I guess. To summarize the main points, it is a documentary, not a movie!The dutch narrators name is Urbanus. It is a Belgium comedian, this makes it a little hypocrite."
251,March of the Penguins,1,5 September 2005,What a waste of time!,"Anthropomorphic (I hope I'm spelling that right) to the hilt. We are told in one of the very first lines and in the very last line that this is a movie about love. ""Love"" my foot! Love is a emotion in humans and maybe primates, not birds, and certainly not shown in any of the birds in this movie. They are all out for survival. But, the filmmakers want us to believe that the penguins feel despair upon losing a chick to the cold. What do they do when this happens? Do they mourn? Do they commit feathery suicide? Nope, they just waddle to the ocean and eat and come back the next year. But the biggest affront to the audience is hidden in the closing credits (right next to scenes of cameramen cavorting with the birds): look for a listing for a foley artist (someone who sits in a booth and makes up sounds with everyday objects -- all the little penguin footsteps were probably done with crunched paper bags), look for a credit for ""additional sound recording"" (where, at the zoo? in a sound booth somewhere?), look for the listings for the special effects crew (a whole ton of them!). Clearly, this was not an authentic documentary, but a recreation of some vision of a film maker. I don't want to see someone's vision of nature sold to me as fact. This movie was not fact, and it should be labeled as such. The director and producers should be ashamed of themselves!"
252,March of the Penguins,1,10 December 2006,Scientifically illiterate sentimental claptrap,"This film is beautifully shot. We have seen the emperor penguins before, shivering in the -60C Antarctic gales, but not like this. Top marks for camera-work. But bottom marks for everything else. It is hard to know where to begin. We are given the impression that emperor penguins find their environment almost impossibly unpleasant. This cannot be true. They are perfectly adapted to their environment. If you moved them to Brazil they would die. What's with the leopard seal? In the cinema the children in the front seats booed and hissed when the mummy penguin was turned into seal lunch. But what was the seal supposed to do? Call out for a pizza? Wild animals eat other animals. That is how it is. The penguins themselves eat fish. If they had made a film called 'march of the fish' would the penguins have been the villains? But it is the 'love' stuff that had me retching. Penguins do not pair-bond for life. A year tops. Some show homosexual behaviour. Apparently the god-botherers in the US got very excited about this film. Stick with the BBC or the Discovery Channel."
253,March of the Penguins,3,26 February 2006,"Beautiful images wasted by poor music, plot and dialogs","Based on a great original idea, ""La marche de l'empereur"" intends to make us share the struggle for life of a group of penguins by adding dialogs and telling a story. But what could have been a good but unoriginal documentary turns into a bad Disney-like sentimental fiction movie. As the told story is exactly what happens in real life, the penguins act like real penguins, but the problem is that they think, and talk (!) like men. Overall the sound is awful, including bad mixing, bad dialogs, terrible music by french artist Emilie Simon, and a bad performance by young french actor Jules Sitruk. Not to mention the linear narrative which is directly inspired bu the humdrum life of a penguinYou'd better watch a BBC documentary with a pertinent voice-over or ""L'ours"" by Jean-Jacques Annaud, that you may like, no matter what you thought of this one."
254,March of the Penguins,1,4 August 2005,nature film,"it is a good film if you like nature films. this is truly just a boring film. Yes I like penguins but i do not want to be hearing about them for 90 minutes. I would rather go see the penguins in a zoo or go and see them in the wild. yes penguins probably do go on a very long journey either to find food, keep from being captured, or to change locations from time to time. However I do believe that it is fantastic to see a nature movie being done. If it were done better, perhaps more people would have enjoyed it and it might have gotten better reviews from some of the critics out there. Other people might like it but I would not waist money to go and see the film for a second time. So if you enjoy nature films this film is probably for you. other films that I can compare it to are the adventures of milo and otis, and homeward bound."
255,March of the Penguins,10,10 July 2005,Fabulous little movie,"If you are into birds or just animals in general, this film may be just for you.Dealing with the harshness that is Mother Nature, March of The Penguins is a beautifully shot documentary that explores the fascinating life of the Emperor Penguin. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer these flightless birds on as they struggle to survive in the brutal Antarctic. I have seen a number of nature programs featuring penguins on PBS and Animal Planet, but I have to say, of all of them, this one is my favorite. I have learned a lot from this movie and will see it time and time again."
256,March of the Penguins,2,15 August 2005,Penguin glop,"Take one part ""Winged Migration"" and 10 parts Disney animal shorts from the 1950s and you have ""March of the Penguins."" There's about 15 minutes of good information and an hour of damned cute penguins. A treacly (and self-contradictory) narration (containing both ""We don't know much about these penguins"" and assurance that all partings are sad and all reunions are joyful) mixed with the gloppiest of new-age background music overwhelm a good story about the animals. No opportunity for simplistic anthropomorphism is missed in a tour de force of dumbing down a genuinely fascinating story. Too bad for the penguins. Too bad for the audience."
257,March of the Penguins,8,7 January 2010,"Beautiful film, but could have done with David Attenborough to narrate it","""March of the Penguins"" is that rare thing- a documentary not made by Michael Moore which became a huge hit at the cinema box office. It is about the Emperor Penguins, the largest species of penguin in the world. Unlike all other penguin species, including the closely related King Penguin, Emperors breed during the Antarctic winter, in inland breeding grounds, which means that they must endure some of the harshest weather on Earth. The distance of the breeding grounds from the sea varies with the seasons, but by the end of the winter they are some 60 miles from open water. After the chicks are born, the parents take it in turns to care for them while the parent of the opposite sex returns to the sea to feed. Even when they reach the sea, they still face dangers in the shape of predators such as leopard seals.The film was immensely popular in France, the USA and many other countries. In Britain we perhaps wondered what all the fuss was about, but then we've been spoilt by all the wonderful nature documentaries on television, especially those produced by the BBC. (The doyen of British wildlife film makers is Sir David Attenborough, younger brother of film director Richard). At least some of the film's success in the US was due to the ""religious right"" trying to claim it for their own. There were even reports of church groups organising their own screenings of the film, in the same way as they organised screenings of Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"".Gibson's film was, of course, deliberately made as a Christian film. I have no idea what Luc Jacquet's religious beliefs are, but even if he is a devout Christian there is no explicit mention of Christianity in this film. The reason for the American churchgoer's sudden interest in the species Aptenodytes forsteri is the claim that the penguins' supposed monogamy and devotion to their chicks make them ideal symbols of conservative family values. Some have gone so far as to claim that the film supports theories of ""intelligent design"" rather than evolution, although I found nothing in either the photography nor the commentary to justify such an assertion.The ""family values"" argument also strikes me as a rather fanciful interpretation of the film, which makes it clear that the penguins are not in fact monogamous in the strict sense of that word. They only pair up for a year at a time, practising serial monogamy rather than lifelong fidelity to a single partner. Only around 15% of Emperor Penguins pair up with the same partner the following year; I doubt if the religious right would have kind words for any human society which had an 85% divorce rate from year to year. In any case, it is self-defeating to use animal behaviour in order to moralise about human sexuality, or any other aspect of human life. For every species that exhibits lifelong fidelity to its mate, one can always find another species that practises what in human terms would be seen as extreme promiscuity.I suspect that if the film had been made by the BBC Wildlife Unit and narrated by David Attenborough it would have turned out differently- in my view rather better. I have not seen the original French version, but Morgan Freeman's English-language commentary, while never as bad as those corny old Disney wildlife films from the fifties, had something of their anthropomorphic flavour, something absent from most British wildlife films. This flavour was reinforced by a rather overblown, sentimental musical score.Visually, however, the film is beautiful, with some striking photography of both the Antarctic landscapes and the birds themselves. It may be anthropomorphic to admire the penguins for their supposed endurance and determination, but I want to end my review by paying tribute to Jacquet and his crew for the endurance and determination they showed in order to bring us this fine documentary. 8/10"
258,March of the Penguins,5,15 July 2006,Blakespot Reviews: March of the Penguins,"I finally saw That Penguin Movie About Penguins . So my mom wanted to see a movie with me and there wasn't much playing. So we agreed to go see that Penguin movie. I mainly agreed to because it was narrated by Morgan Freeman and cause well... my mom was paying. It wasn't so much that the movie was bad... cause it wasn't, it's just that... it was about Penguins... the whole thing. 90 minutes is an awful lot of Penguin. That being said for a Penguin movie it was really well made. Also I'm afraid I must admit that baby penguins are unreasonabally cute. They're like puppy-dogs in little tuxes. So if you have nothing to do for about 85 minutes and someone else is willing to pay, I'd say hell yeah, go see the Penguins."
259,March of the Penguins,10,31 March 2006,What dedication.,"This movie shows the natural instinct, dedication, and devotion to their sole offspring.How sad that humans are the only creatures capable of willingly destroying their own young. Only man elevates himself and herself to a point where selfishness and heartlessness allows them to kill their own children. Slaughtered by the millions every year ... hidden in abortuaries and producing life-long guilt and torment for their mothers. Mothers never told about their options and the consequences of living with knowing you have killed your own child.These creatures willingly choose to endure unbelievable hardships and storms to protect their one egg. They die just for the chance to protect them. Humans will not even tolerate minor discomforts to protect their young. Others make money from destroying these children.Many people could learn a lot about how to be caring, dedicated, selfless, and nurturing from these wonderful creatures. Basically a definition of love. Love your child, don't kill her."
260,March of the Penguins,8,26 March 2006,Ice Ice Penguin Baby To Go!,"Who would have thought that a documentary film about some black & white birds would profit so much green? ""March of the Penguins"" is one of the most celebrated documentaries of all time. This daring doc focuses on the yearly march of the penguins for mating, chic bearing, and survival in sub-zero Antarctica. It is a wobbly winner. Director Luc Jacquet must have worn several ""jacquets"" in demonstrating the struggle of the penguin in freezing temperatures. He must be commended for his tenacious directorial effort. I am sure many major motion picture studios will be ""lucing"" for Luc to direct their future documentary projects. ""March of the Penguins"" is narrated by master auteur storyteller Morgan Freeman. I guess every thing Morgan touches or narrates for that matter turns out to be a million dollar , baby! So as you can see it's written entirely in black & white that the ""March of the Penguins"" is the emperor of all animal documentaries. **** Good"
261,March of the Penguins,9,23 March 2006,Great Documentary,"I was surprised and pleased upon finding out that this film was made by France. I just assumed it was U.S. made. But it's still a great documentary.There's no need for a spoilers warning; this is just a documentary. But I marked it just in case.Morgan Freeman narrated the U.S. version of this film, telling about how the emperor penguins go off many miles to a nesting place, and stay there for a long time, mating, taking care of their young, and feeding their young.The penguins are real, and I think this was the best Documentary last year. There's no contest.My Score: 9/10."
262,March of the Penguins,7,18 March 2006,"MARCH OF THE PENGUINS (Luc Jacquet, 2005) ***","Fascinating documentary examining the hardship Emperor penguins have to endure in order to survive in Antarctica, particularly their long annual trek en masse away from the sea so that they can mate and breed in safety. Despite the beautiful cinematography of the vast icy landscape, accompanied by an equally evocative score, the film is an intimate and frankly distressing portrait of animal life in the most extreme of conditions - alternately funny, touching and sad.I don't usually seek out feature-length documentaries but, surprisingly enough, I've already watched two this year: GRIZZLY MAN (2005), primarily due to Werner Herzog's involvement; and now this, having recently won the coveted Academy Award, which I feel is a truly remarkable achievement in every sense."
263,March of the Penguins,6,16 March 2006,I don't get it,"I watched the movie last night and enjoyed it, although I would agree with earlier poster's comments that the dialogue was overly sentimental.What I don't understand though is why the American Christian right embraced the movie with such vigour. The movie that I watched did not give any evidence towards the presence of a creator, merely that the birds were suited to their environment.I am not looking to start a debate about the existence of God or the merits of Science over faith, I have my own beliefs on such things that couldn't be swayed by a chat forum, the real question I am asking is what was it about this movie that the Christian Right embraced and what elements of the film suggested the existence of a Creator?Clearly there something that I am missing..."
264,March of the Penguins,9,24 January 2006,The march of the life.,"This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. In Mexico, this kind of movies are usually not presented, but, since other documentary works, like Bowling for Columbine or Born into Brothels, this is a genre that is taking a place in the theaters. The movie is a familiar movie, the music (french or American) is amazing, cinematography extraordinary an the penguins are HOT. Cince Madagascar they became one of the most popular animal species and with this wonderful documentary, they have a potential in theaters amazing.The message is simple, how much life is necessary to bring out new life. The only part that I can complain is that the movie doesn't mention something about the global warming, an interesting subject that deserves less manipulation."
265,March of the Penguins,10,20 January 2006,An extremely heart touching movie,"Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. March of the Penguins is a documentary that goes out to capture the struggle that a particular group of penguins goes through every time they try to reproduce. It may not sound like much boiled down to it's basics, but after watching the movie, I was completely blown away. After witnessing this ordeal, it really makes you look at yourself, and the human race as a whole. My first comments after leaving the theater were ""If humans had to go through anything close to that to reproduce, we would have died off a long time ago."" This film truly encapsulates the essence of nature, and distills a product that is palatable even to a casual documentary fan. The camera work is nothing short of amazing, and they do a marvelous job ""humanizing"" the penguins, so that you grow emotionally attached to them very early on. Morgan Freeman's narration is spot on, his voice only coming in during important moments, and not drowning out the film. Much of the movie is silent, which is perfect as it allows the viewer to breath in what is going on in front of them. If you are the type of person who just plain despises documentaries, then this movie isn't for you. Anyone else should be able to see the simple elegance of this movie. Definitely one of the best I've ever seen."
266,March of the Penguins,10,19 January 2006,Watching the Birdies,"I like natural history documentaries and I loved this one with some reservations. If the story is about ""love"" as the introduction states, the director's emotional interpretation and treatment of the biological imperative of the Emperor penguin drives to eat, mate, and ensure the survival of each generation missed the cue when emotional sentience came into the behavior of these magnificent animals. One would hope audiences are enthralled, enchanted, and entertained by the creatures which inhabit the portion of the earth where modern man has yet to irrevocably destroy its habitat. For this reason, the director injected the storyline of ""love"" as the visceral emphasis for the film to hook today's jaded audiences. If so, it works. I tear up watching the amazing story although I consider myself forthright jaded but not in this situation. Evenso, the penguin saga is the kind of film that can be easily reduced to maudlin sentimentalism were not for the stunning DP and camera-work. The crew's fortitude during the most harsh conditions of Antartica's seasons is meritorious beyond the call to duty by the film makers under blizzard conditions.The story is made all the more compelling by the narrator, Morgan Freeman, whose soft accent and comfortable delivery makes the film intriguing, and not a dry discourse in the natural science of vertebrate zoology. It's approachable and friendly as well as a beautiful example of less is more in the visual medium. However, I did want to know something more about the birds that is not part of the glorious colors, stark setting, and endearing little black and white faces of the chicks. Do they learn specific penguin behaviors from the parents? Do the chicks become socialized to their roles in the society by elder birds, or is the drive to feed so strong that the behaviors of the young is learned by group consensus. What of their ""song"" between father and chick to identify from the pack. Does it change between mother and chick and does she also bond by the vocalizing of the baby to find her offspring when returning from feeding. Some questions are just glossed over in the ""love story."" Of course, the dark side of mother nature is the reality of death and with birds of such emotional drawing power, the editing leaves alone the facts that not all survive, the old, sick, young, and unlucky just ""vanish"" from the group. It is not a gore fest, but almost graying out from the white stark environment where the only color seems to be the orange feathering around the adult's eyes.When a day in the burbs or concrete jungle becomes overwhelming, stick in this CD. It will bring home the point that everything is relative, and for humans, some tribes of black and white individuals are so much more interesting and deserving of our complete respect."
267,March of the Penguins,6,10 January 2006,"Decent documentary, but why all the love?","March of the Penguins is essentially an (over)dramatized documentary. It takes biologically-driven behavior and tries to assign human traits to the penguins' actions. The movie as a documentary was OK. One of the ""special features"" is, interestingly, a documentary about the documentary which in my opinion was actually better than March of the Penguins. It was shot chronologically and also followed the penguins, but instead of the overly dramatic narration of MOTP (which included Morgan Freeman describing a penguin which lost its chick as if the penguin was in deep anguish and ready to whip out an Uzi and wipe out the colony to erase its pain), it has the French-accented voice of the director describing more clearly and in more informative terms what the penguins are doing. I gave MOTP a 6."
268,March of the Penguins,10,10 January 2006,Testament to the power of cooperation,"Great documentary.March of the Penguins is a testament to the power of cooperation, something that is sorely missed in modern day human society. We could all use the Emperor Penguins as an example of how to work together for the common good. Unlike the penguins I feel that humans today are making many decisions that adversely affect the common good especially for the generations to come. Whether it's ecological destruction, cancer causing pollution or passing enormous debt to our grandchildren, we are leaving a terrible burden to future generations. Perhaps this documentary will make some realize that we all too need to make some sacrifices today in order to make life better for our children and their children.Strangely ""March of the Penguins"" reminded me of ""The Lord of the Rings: Two Towers"" but instead of people trying to stay alive in a fortress it's a bunch of Emperor Penguins working together to keep from freezing to death. Like ""Lord of the Rings"" it has an epic quest from the sea to the breeding grounds and not everyone makes it.Technically this documentary is also amazing in that people were able to film under these terribly inhospitable conditions. The underwater footage is absolutely amazing. I definitely recommend this movie. Great fun and education for the whole family."
269,March of the Penguins,5,6 January 2006,"MARCH OF THE PENGUINS : Pretty, Sweet, & Incredibly Slow Moving...","MARCH OF THE PENGUINS Not to say this film doesn't have beautiful moments, a touching narrative line, and an altogether incredible story to tell... but what was all of the fuss?! I'm not a big fan of documentaries and I rarely seek them out. However, the affection for this film was so overwhelming I was curious. I know it was marketed towards younger children, and families went to it for months... but how were young kids not bored or disturbed? I fell asleep twice while watching the movie.And the scenes showing the deaths of young chicks, mothers, and the depression that ensues just seemed a bit intense for a film that was so popular with youth. But then again, I've always been the kind of wuss that can't see an antelope get eaten on Animal Planet without feeling terrible.I acknowledge that this film captures a fascinating story that I was completely unaware of... and there is some unbelievably stunning imagery captured in the most desolate place on earth... and for that, the film deserves some recognition.But 80 minutes was simply too long for me. So many lingering shots that weren't progressing anything, and it just got a little tiresome to me. I also despised the score for this film. That same repeated theme over and over and over... whether things were happy, sad, boring, exciting. Score was just awful.Had this been about half it's length, I think it could have been a clear, concise, and fascinating documentary... but as it is, it seems desperately stretched out to reach a full-length running time of 80 minutes.Penguins are cute and I laughed at many of the little tumbles they take on the ice. And I thought it was adorable watching the bond these animals form. But for me, it just didn't add up to the great theatrical experience that millions of people who made into a hit.Decent, underwhelming, beautiful, and kinda boring.... C- ..."
270,March of the Penguins,10,29 December 2005,Marching towards a new feet in documentaries,"One of the most unique movies ever made. The penguins is a terrific tale of how a penguin (Emperor Penguin), survives the harsh winter through rough storms, predators, and the conditions that depend on the mates to actually live on, and the offspring develop.Morgan Freeman gives an inept performance narrating this terrific documentary of penguins. He gives it a terrific delivery, and an actual you-are-there experience, as if you were in the Artic right now, swimming with those penguins. Its a terrific experience, and sets the stage for new documentaries similar the the one that was made here. Maybe the next one will be on whales? Or the seal themselves? Whatever it is, its a new step towards success, and its new, its riveting, its wild, and its sad. Some parts will make you cry, but most parts will make you learn, and make you feel for these penguins, and what they do to stay alive, and survive the cold Artic climate, because its the winter that brings out the bitterness in us all, even in Mother Nature.And for this, the 10 stars aren't for the penguins themselves, the way National Geographic made this movie was absolutely 100% authentic. The photography was nothing short of spectacular, the filming was almost realistic as you can get to the penguins, and the score went along perfectly with those little penguins, and how they needed to live out, or die.10/10, in my book."
271,March of the Penguins,7,27 December 2005,Fabulous photography but painful soundtrack.,"March of the Penguins is a treasure of observation and knowledge.It is compelling viewing. A story of life on the edge. The parenting ritual of the Emperor Penguin appears to be just on the limit of what is possible. With the omnipresent threat of death by freezing or starvation.The stars of the film are stunningly beautiful, with elegant curves and tireless dedication.The photography follows the troop of penguins across the ice and stays with them throughout the severe winds of the arctic winter.After such dedication by the film crew it is very sad that film is almost ruined by the sound track. Firstly there's the condescending narrative - OK - there had to be some kind of informative narration - but it could have been less dramatic and insensitive. Secondly there is a rather pathetic attempt to inject human motives, tear jerking and slapstick humour.But the worst crime was the music. Noisily and competing with the photography. It is painfully overbearing, insensitive and dim, it bluntly attempts to tug at the viewers emotions - they might as well have put up big letters on screen - ""everyone laugh now"", ""weep now"", ""gasp now"" etc.Producers take note please. When you've got photography this good please please let it speak for itself."
272,March of the Penguins,9,20 December 2005,Miles to go,"Not until the closing credits did I fully realize who the stars of ""The March of the Penguins"" are. National Geographic photographers have been a part of my entire life, as I have chosen to tune in to their fascinating true tales of nature just as my father did. To view wildlife close-up, especially from inconceivable angles, fascinated father and son. ""How in hell did they get a camera located to take THAT shot?"" I remember my father exclaiming. As I watched this movie, however, I was too absorbed in the story to ponder such feats. That is, until the closing credits showed the photographic team, bundled into anonymity, going about the work that would allow them to allow us to feel like we had been there, among the penguins.Penguins are technically birds but essentially fish. Ironically, they don't fly and, at least during this film, they do little swimming. The ""march"" refers to the 70-mile trek, on talon, Emperor Penguins make annually upon maturity to reach their mating grounds. But as any parent knows, that is only the start of a great adventure. While the ladies head back for food, males stoically protect their eggs from unfathomable wintry conditions. Upon their return some 120 days later, well-fed mothers relieve the starving fathers, who yet wait for the eggs to hatch so as to establish a recognition code with their newborns. When the fathers eventually return with more food to regurgitate into the hungry mouths of growing offspring, the mothers have already taken their leaves. Their complex form of communication allows what appear to be thousands of clones to recognize each other.""The March of the Penguins"" accomplishes typical National Geographic magic, but the film does so in unusual style. Anchored by Morgan Freeman's preternatural gift for narration, we watch as ""birds"" dive 1700 feet into the icy waters off Antarctica to gather food, we cry as parents and chicks fail to survive the brutal conditions, we tremble as predators from the deep and from the sky take their toll, we laugh as marchers slip and fall on the ice, we sympathize as they squawk in apparent humiliation and we cheer when they climb back to their feet and clamber on. Freeman tells us that these magnificent creatures are not all that unlike humans, and we believe him, not only because of his undeniable voice, but because the photography depicts the enthusiasm of families being formed, suffering separations, mourning losses and exulting in reunions. Engrossed in such scenes, it is easy to forget that some truly devoted and persistent humans were necessary to bring these fascinating revelations to us.On the down side, perhaps to retain a ""G"" rating, the film does not reveal actual scenes of mating. It instead turns penguin sex into anthropomorphized scenes of romance. The footage also fails to address hints of cannibalism among the penguins. Non-experts are left to guess whether flightless birds of the Antarctic sea would devour its own kind to survive on the icy land.Nonetheless, ""March"" succeeds because of its remarkable demonstrations of similarities between humans and penguins. Our species is supposedly the only one which can adapt its environment in order to survive. That may be so, but this penguin species is the only one which has adapted itself to survive for countless generations in the least hospitable environment on Earth. Kudos to the extraordinary team of photographers who make viewers feel like participants in this fascinating march of penguins."
273,March of the Penguins,9,14 November 2005,"The true Kings of beasts, not those mangy lions!","Some years ago now my daughters and I spent a most memorable two weeks living in a tent at an Emperor Penguin breeding site in the Antarctic spring. We even went through a mighty blizzard together! I have also visited other sites at other times. By any measure this is a remarkable documentary. The French have done it before with ""The Paradox of the Emperors"", but this is even better. It is an exceptionally difficult breeding cycle to capture as the weather conditions are extreme and lighting conditions frequently almost impossible. Many reviews of this film inevitably contain inaccuracies as this is not a subject that many are familiar with. Preparing a text for the narrator is also no easy task and the French and American approaches are quite different. On balance I prefer the American approach. Emperors are not of course human but have many behavioral practices that superficially are quite similar to some of ours. This can easily make them appear cute and cuddly in the cinema. A wallop from the wing of an angry bird can quickly bring one quite literally down to earth.The photography is almost beyond criticism, bearing in mind the challenges the team faced. 10 out of 10 here. The narration is not always strictly accurate but is designed to draw the audience in. 6 out of 10 is all I would give. Too much missed out and too cloying here and there. No fault of Mr Freeman! The music was just ghastly in my opinion but that will not be everyone's judgment. The French version is said to be even worse! My biggest regret was the minimal cover given to the darker side of this most arduous of life cycles. Adult birds taken by leopard seals and killer whales, eggs and chicks, (and adult birds as well), overwhelmed by ferocious Antarctic blizzards. In some years and at some sites almost no chicks survive at all. Of course the newly born chicks are easy prey themselves when they finally go to sea in December. Human pollution is another growing threat to the Emperor's environment. It is quite a shock to find so much human garbage floating onto Antarctic shores.I hope the DVD will give prominence to the makers of this film, they are almost as great a set of heroes as the Emperors. At least penguins are designed to survive in such weather. See this film, even better buy the DVD and watch it many times. Take a pinch of salt with the narration. See also Sir David Attenborough's ""Life in the Freezer"". This is one of the best wildlife documentaries you will be likely to see. With a better score, more realistic narration and less left on the cutting room floor it undoubtedly could have been even better. The photographers and the penguins however have delivered quite brilliant performances."
274,March of the Penguins,,14 August 2005,Penguins have a horrible life,"The March of the Penguins is a National Geographic documentary. It shows the yearly march inland of 70 miles to the mating spot of the Emperor penguins. The photography is good. There are vistas of the Antarctic landscape, raging storms, the penguins themselves, and some underwater scenes. The movie does not give much scientific information. It doesn't show the people actually involved in the documentary until the end credits. But overall it is interesting. Morgan Freeman does the narration in too noble of a voice, as if he were narrating the life of Shakespeare. At times the script tends to attribute human feelings to the penguins and I thought the script was written by some pro-family evangelical ministry; it almost seems preaching. Yes, the penguins seem to be pro-family and I didn't get that they were into practicing abortion, but come one, they are just penguins after all. This probably should have been shown on TV instead of in the theater. Worth seeing for a bargain movie."
275,March of the Penguins,10,10 August 2005,A Rare Gem That Is Visually Stunning and Emotionally Stimulating.,"I had the privilege of being one of the first critics to review this exquisite work of art at the Los Angeles Film Festival. Quite simply, ""March of the Penguins"" is the MUST SEE FILM OF THE YEAR! Antarctica was not always the pristine frozen tundra that we see today. On the contrary, eons ago the land was warm and fertile, filed with a myriad of flora and fauna. But as the tides turned and the winds grew cold, in the truest sense of Darwinism (survival of the fittest), the little Emperor Penguin adapted to the ever changing world to become pretty much the only real resident of this now icy continent. And as part of that survival, the Emperor Penguin (some 3-4 feet in height and 90 pounds of cuteness) has returned each year to what has become their evolutionary breeding grounds ""where each and every one of them has been born"" for centuries. As testament to their innate adaptability, the penguins have long ago learned that ""home"" must be inland where the ice is thickest so as not to fall into the chilly seas when spring thaws the icy floes. Even young chicks have this innate sense of survival and seemingly without instruction know where to go and what! to do.Marching single file through catabatic conditions, blinding blizzards and gale force winds across 70 some miles of icy plains, the male Emperor Penguins leave the safety of the ocean once a year in the fall as they head to their instinctively known breeding grounds to find the love of their life and satisfy their overwhelming urge to reproduce. And yes, it is true, the Emperor Penguin has one mate for life. Fascinatingly, once the female lays a lone egg, it is the male that stands as guardian until hatching while the female goes out across the plains back to the ocean to forage not only for her own nourishment, but for her young chick as well. In two months when the little hatchlings arrive, it's up to mom to make sure that she makes it back with food for her young, at which point, dad then heads back out to see. A cycle that continues until the young chick is able to make its first venture into the icy seas of the Antarctic, a more beautiful story of familial love can not be found.Four years in the making, Jacquet and his crew spent over a year in Antarctica. Using 16mm film in order to capture the true magnificence of the region, Jacquet and his crew shot 120 hours of footage, eventually editing it down to 80 minutes of the most breathtakingly beautiful, elegant and endearing film around. With specialized underwater cameras, he was able to obtain never before seen footage of the penguins underwater - a site that will make your eyes wide with the wonder of those of a child.Not only concerned with minimizing human contact with the 1200 plus penguins filmed during this march, Jacquet and his crew faced some incredible technical and logistical challenges. 130 pounds of equipment had to be carried daily by each crew member working a day's shoot. According to one of the Directors of Photography Laurent Chalet, only two things ever kept them from shooting - the weather and running out of film when out on ice floes. Jacquet and company also lacked the luxury of dailies or rushes and never saw even one frame film until after they had returned to ""civilization."" There was also the added uncertainty of not knowing when the penguins would be gathering for their march or what would happen as nature took its course, which meant the crew had to be ready at a moment's notice.The result of Jacquet's commitment and dedication to this specialized form of documentary is a film for the entire family. With exacting simplicity and emotion, ""March of the Penguins"" is a rare gem that is not just visually stunning and stimulating, but emotionally stimulating as well. It touches the heart. With sparse narration by Morgan Freeman, written by Jordan Roberts, and beauteous orchestrations led by conductor Jeff Schindler, Jacquet lets the magic of the penguins speak for itself.Come March 2006, don't be surprised to see ""March of Penguins"" waddle away with a Best Picture Oscar, just like the Emperor Penguins will waddle into your heart."
276,March of the Penguins,10,8 August 2005,Fantastic,"The trailer for March of the Penguins looked superb, and I was excited to see this film. While adapted from the original French versions (Morgan Freedman narrates rather than ""voices"" interpreting the actions/thoughts of the animals), the film is wonderful. Shot documentary style, the film follows the mating rituals of the Emperor Penguin in Antarctica as they travel long distances to meet and mate, gather food, and care for their young despite freezing temperatures, predators, hunger, and all of nature's obstacles. There are several scenes of nature taking its toll, and this elicited some emotions from people watching. Most children in the theater can handle it, but I suspect that like Bambi, there will be several people who are upset from the visuals (specifically several frozen penguins and child penguins, a penguin in a seal's mouth, and a winged predator killing a baby penguin). The music is typically good and sometimes great. All in all a wonderful film."
277,March of the Penguins,10,7 August 2005,And you thought you knew everything about penguins. . .,"Compare your life to an Emperor Penguin's and I guarantee you that your's is probably easier. Eight months of the year is dedicated to delivering one new chick and four months of the year is dedicated to eating and not being eaten. In an icy wasteland, to boot.I learned a lot about the little guys (and gals) and the arduous process of bringing a baby chick to life and keeping it alive. They don't all make it.It's very gratifying to see the ones that do make it and it gives us hope. The cinematography is beautiful, the texture of the penguins' feathers and the tender way the mated pairs treat each other. And the little penguins are cute."
278,March of the Penguins,10,18 July 2005,Unforgettable,"I'm completely blown away by the film, 'March of the Penguins' (US translation). Your introduction to the Emperor penguins is comical. They shoot out of a hole in the ice and land on their fat bellies. They begin single-file marching on snow and appear to be clowns in a circus.However, their quest is real. Emperor penguins must persevere under one of Nature's harshest reproduction rituals. At the end of the film, when a litter of new penguins dive into the ice water, you feel like you've survived the harsh Antarctica winter with them. You feel like you've cheated Death too.'March of the Penguins' is a great doku for this stressful time."
279,March of the Penguins,10,23 December 2005,What Has Our Society Come To When March Of The Penguins Is The Blockbuster Hit Of The Summer?,"I've been a major Hollywood director for a long time, and I thought I'd seen it all. But I can't help wondering what's happening to the entertainment industryindeed, to our entire society. Where are our standards? Our values? For !*@#'s sakeour cultural priorities? I simply cannot accept that March Of The Penguins is the big summer hit everybody's talking about. Hello? It used to be that a summer blockbuster had to have brutal violence, sexy women, breathtaking action sequences, adrenaline-pumping high-speed chasesat a bare minimum, some explosions. But sitting through that penguin movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. Where were the big set pieces? Heck, this movie didn't even have sets! Has anyone ever heard of production values? It's one of the most vital aspects of the film-making art, and you don't get it by just showing up on an iceberg and filming whatever happens to be in front of you. Frankly, for real icebergs, they looked fake. This film is an insult to the great men and women who spend countless hours in front of computers creating incredibly realistic CGI icebergs.Does no one out there care about these things anymore but me? Am I a lone voice of sanity crying out in a universe gone mad? What kind of a world do we live in when a futuristic technological thriller starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as escaped clones on levitating jet bikes doesn't out gross the behind out of a glorified Discovery Channel rerun? Don't people realize how much money I spent? How many people it took to bring that vision to the screen? Do people realize how many rewrites and punch-ups we went through? I paid my writers millions of dollars, and they were some of the best in the biz. You know who wrote their script? A bunch of birds.Where was the villain? A story's not going to keep an audience on the edge of their seats without a strong opposition. Where was the second-act turning point? You've gotta have that moment when the hero's at the end of his rope and the bad guy looks like he's going to win it all. And where was the love story? Stars have to have real chemistry that smolders on the screen to make a summer blockbuster one to remember. Okay, the penguin movie had mating cycles, but that's not love. Is it all about sex to these animals? Speaking of which, I think we can all agree that the penguins in this film gave some pretty wooden performances. In many scenes, it was impossible to tell them apart. Maybe if they'd moved the camera once in a while, I could have gotten more emotionally invested in what was going on. For goodness' sake, there was not a single crane shot in the whole movie! I remember a day when the public appreciated fine cinema. In that lost age, it made sense that my important historical drama Pearl Harbor had a fighting chance for at least a special-effects Oscar. Best sound, no question. But now, in this crazy upside-down, top-see-turvy world, I hear thatguess what?the only summer movie getting any Oscar buzz is a static, near-silent documentary about waddling, flightless birds! These days, I guess old-fashioned values like ""megawattage,"" ""high-octane thrill rides,"" and ""explosions"" just don't matter anymore. Well, I call that a sad day for American movie-making.I'm busy in preproduction planning my next big spectacle (which no one will see because they'll be off watching a 10-hour documentary on park squirrels, no doubt). But if you are in the San Diego area, do me this favor: Go to Sea World, walk into the emperor-penguin exhibit, and clock one those things right in the face. Tell 'em Michael Bay sent ya."
280,March of the Penguins,6,28 July 2005,"Possibly more punch per penguin as an IMAX?... flaws in script, concept,  soundtrack - better candidate as PBS special, but weak by those standards, okay for a matinée","Wanting to be more generous than my reluctant 6 star vote because I am glad to see documentaries find their way to the big screen, I am sad to say that March of the Penguins, like the very birds themselves, did not fly. It might have had more punch per penguin as an IMAX, but in the theater it fell flat. But FYI, my date thought the penguins were cute and that was enough to forgive any other flaws in the movie. Not being bound by that tug on my heartstrings, I found penguin mating/migration to be a less than impressive justification for an $8 theater ticket, and at best is matinée worthy. The script was weak, though I did enjoy the familiar narration by the always likable voice of Morgan Freeman. And this script was full of inappropriate humanimations in which human traits are superimposed on animals. The soundtrack was over-the-top, after all, this is a documentary about penguins, not a romance feature film.Two curious things: penguins spend most of their time above ground walking fully erect with human-like bipedal motion; with virtually no natural defenses against predators, even the likes of a seagull, Penguins present possibly the greatest challenge to the evolutionary tenet of survival of the fittest. If you love furry animals, you will probably like this film no matter what anybody says. If you catch a matinée, with restrained expectations you will likely waddle out not too dissatisfied. Lastly, this film will not keep the interest of little kids who will go stir crazy and annoy the adults around them."
281,March of the Penguins,7,24 July 2005,Wonderful story - movie falls short however,"For a movie to be cinematically successful, it must generate emotions in the viewer. This documentary is laden with drama but falls short in one critical area - the soundtrack. It took about 20 minutes for me to figure this out. All of this wonderful scenery with a story of heroic proportions and a cast of thousands - and maudlin music. Leaving the theater, I couldn't help thinking how better it would have been with a score by Vangelis or even James Horner ( who could have gone back to Sibelius for more material ). A lost opportunity in my opinion.And yes, I too kept thinking about the hardships of filming in such environs and look forward to the ""Making of..."""
282,March of the Penguins,1,21 May 2006,Stick with BBC Attenborough Documentaries,"Rented this movie expecting something a bit different to your average TV Wildlife documentary. Yes, the close up photography was good, but the film is devastatingly slow and you find yourself desperately hoping the film will end so you can put something else on. Unlike a 'proper' BBC documentary you find that there are many questions which are unanswered in relation the the animals and their environment. In short don't bother getting this out on DVD. But if it is on TV record it and save it for a lazy Sunday afternoon when their is absolutely nothing else on the other channels. Don't forget to keep your remote in hand so you can fast forward the really slow bits."
283,March of the Penguins,4,18 September 2005,This movie is not for young children or the tenderhearted.,"This unique movie was beautifully filmed. Unlike many wildlife films, it was not graphic, and the harsh realities were dealt with in a reserved and respectful manner. However, I felt that the previews were quite misleading. I was under the impression that it would be a cute, funny, lighthearted movie that would be appropriate for all family members, including young children. But when my 7 year old niece went to this movie, there were several scenes that had her in tears. She had trouble going to sleep that night, and it bothered her whenever she thought about it for the next few days. I would never have taken her if the previews had been a bit more accurate. This movie also taught me that a ""G"" rating does NOT necessarily mean it is appropriate for young children."
284,March of the Penguins,9,9 January 2006,"Breathtaking film,though it does not sugar coat penguins' experiences in the wild.","Penguins are indeed among the most entertaining of God's creatures to watch as they go about their business.You can't help but love them as they are also among the most gentle and non combative creatures on earth.That being said,those that go into the viewing of this film thinking that it is basically a children's story should be warned that though penguins are cute and fun to watch,this film does not sugar coat their experiences in the wild.It is just as harsh for them as it is for any other wild creature,and this is documented in this film.There are the elements,and there are predators.In short,be mindful of these facts for your kids sake if you choose to let them watch.All of that aside,it is an excellent film.The cinematography is breathtaking,and though there is tragedy along the way,the ending is a happy one.Morgan Freeman narrates the American version of the film,and not a better choice could have been made,as he has more than proved himself in the area of narration in past films.This film's a winner!"
285,March of the Penguins,,20 November 2005,Attention Span Required!,"I remember hearing very good things about it. It had better reviews than some of the action films coming out at the time. It was well-loved by many critics, but the film was a disappointment.After hearing all the hype, I decided to see what it was about. I sat through the entire movie, not having my expectations filled.The shots are beautiful. The penguins look very real. Morgan Freeman is one of the best narrators ever. (He narrated for The Shawshank Redemption, War of the Worlds and Million Dollar Baby.) The camera crew was sat through cold weather just to get this film shot! So, what was so unappealing about it? I didn't think the film offered enough information to satisfy me. (being an animal freak an all) The movie was considered to be touching, but I wasn't moved at all. (Or, I could be heartless.) Most of all, if the movie doesn't grab you during the beginning, than you missed your chance to become interested. An attention span is required! If you think you will be able to sit through it, by all means, go watch it. If not, spent your money on something else."
286,March of the Penguins,5,21 August 2005,A very nice National Geographic Special,"This was a very nice National Geographic Special, but it was not a big-screen movie.The film image quality was often poor. Sometimes this was used to good effect, but mostly it simply distracted from the film.The end of the film showed film of the film's. As I had watched penguins huddle in the middle of a prolific blizzard, I thought of the camera men and others present in the same storm getting the footage. During the portions of film that were grainy and splotchy to negative effect, I thought of how hard it was to get this film and that it must have been originally intended for television, where this level of quality would not have been an issue.That said, the images presented were up to the high levels of the magazine and television efforts of National Geographic. The images were often breath-taking, touching, humorous, contemplative.I was led to believe by certain reviews that there were characters that emerged from the film. This is not true. There was some very nice narration by Morgan Freeman, but no characters, no relationships between characters, nor was there even a specific penguin or penguin family followed.The film was a little different from most of the National Geographic-type documentaries, in that it often focused on the hardships, dangers, and death. The inclusion of these topics did not weigh down the film, but added depth to it.Other than that, I could have sworn I saw it in PBS 20 years ago.I took my three children to it. The following comments were whispered to me during the movie: ""Dad, when does the good part start?"" ""What's so great about Emperor penguins?"" (Perhaps he was confused by the appellation.) My three year old son requested to go to the bathroom so often, I eventually had to say, ""No more!"" So overall, it was a mixed bag. Some very nice images were presented, but they were often muddled by technicalities. Some very effective documentary work was evident, but not a character driven story, which would have kept my three-year-old in place."
287,March of the Penguins,9,6 August 2005,A Very Good Movie but.....,"This is a very good film. Actually a great film, A MUST SEE! I usually don't see documentaries but this one looked very good. The beginning scenes where an introduction, from that the story begins.... The penguins marching to there mating ground. When they finally get there they try to find a mate and get babies. As I said in the Summary, A Very Good Film but.... the movie had a lot of deaths and they say it is a family movie. The life of Penguins is very complicated and I wouldn't want to be one. If you want to see this film fine, but it is not for younger kids, mostly for adults and kids who won't be sad about death. Well I give March of the Penguins 2 Thums UP!!!!"
288,March of the Penguins,2,4 September 2005,If you have just 80 minutes to live - watch this movie,"If you have just 80 minutes to live - watch this movie - it will seem an eternity. This movie is like a National Geographic special without the insight or action. It moves very slowly giving us anecdotes about the penguins without a perspective on how they fit in the larger picture. Since there are no reference points we can't even tell how tall they are. We get no sense of their number, their lifespan - how many marches do they take? How do the chicks fatten up when the parents are gone? What happens to the chick being attacked by the unidentified predator that looked like a seagull? Is this the only colony and the only location? If distraught mothers try to steal chicks what happens to orphaned chicks? The shots are pretty and the landscape impressive (although the film might as well have been shot in black and white - think about it). Yes nature is awesome and inspiring, amazing and multifaceted - this film is not."
289,March of the Penguins,1,23 December 2008,i actually fell asleep in theaters,i have to say it was the most boring and dumbest thing I've ever layed eyes on. I knew most of the stupid stuff on the movie. I had to go with my grandma and my step mom!!! my step mom started to cry when the stupid walrus whatever ate the penguins or whatever!! my grandmother agreed with me that it was stupid!!! I think I feel asleep for 10 minutes until my step mom woke me up!!! I wanted to hurt her so bad!!! If you plan to buy this movie I feel really sorry for ya sucker cuz its the dumbest movie ever made!!! I'd much rather watch teletubies or Barnie or something stupid like that!!! I think it was supposed to be educational but it rotted my eyes and brains!!! The only thing I learned was that I really needed a life back then to drag myself out to that STUPID MOVIE!!! GOD PLEASE Don't EVER SEND SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO US EVER AGAIN ... PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU!!!
290,March of the Penguins,1,26 April 2008,Darrell Castle: Vice President or bust.,"Many viewers of this film have come out strongly in favor of this film. The applaud the filming of this flightless bird in Antarctica and tell the audience that its worth the price for admission because of its beauty. Well, art also needs to keep people awake.It isn't the subject matter. Having a movie with penguins is fine. Just don't present the world with a documentary on how emperor penguins pair up, mate, lay an egg, and travel long distances for food. Interesting, but it is worth 5-15 minutes, not 80. And that is why I can't recommend this.When I like learning about an animal or any subject matter, I pick up news articles, journals, and books. But this presented a dry documentary and old voice-over and nothing else. I was actually glad when I saw threats to these birds.Overall, not very well done. ""F"""
291,March of the Penguins,2,4 February 2006,Fail to see the appeal,"Yes, penguins are the trendy cute species for 2005. For a documentary: it was well filmed, informative, had some comedic moments, and showed the vast emptiness of the environment in which these creatures live. GOSH, what a boring, excruciating experience it was to endure this piece of celluloid. If you want gun battles, car chases, sci-if adventures go see something  anything else. If you like penguins, here is your cup of tea.Despite pulling in more than 80 million dollars, I fail to see the appeal. Typically, I tend to enjoy like educational, enlightening topics such as this. However, not this time. If you have kids under 10, this may be the only redeeming value to seeing March of the Penguins."
292,March of the Penguins,7,3 August 2005,"Cute story, great photography, but why the wide release?","Caught this movie last night, and while it's definitely a fascinating, great-looking documentary, I must say I'm a little surprised that this is the same movie that cracked into the Box Office Top Ten! It's a great story, and just getting it all on film is an accomplishment, but why penguins? The animal world has hundreds of amazing survival stories happening across the globe at any minute- which makes me wonder, again, how one cute movie about penguins- which isn't much more impressive than your average National Geographic special- could have such a big theatrical audience. Maybe this is just a result of Fahrenheit 9/11's success- maybe studios are pushing docs more than before. These are two very different movies, but the success of Michael Moore's docs might just be opening the door to more non-fiction movies, and in that way, the wide release of March of the Penguins could just be the studio testing the waters with a family-friendly film."
293,March of the Penguins,1,30 August 2012,Awful...,"This was one of the most uninteresting, boring and worst movies (or documentaries) that i ever saw in the cinema. When i saw it in 3d on a big IMAX screen it bored the life out of me. I know that no one ever followed penguins around so closely and yes,i also think that penguins are cute, but this was one of my personal ""Top Ten: The worst and the Boring""... every 2nd regular BBC documentary manages to be somewhat cool and enlightening about some aspect of animal life. This movie should be 15 Minutes long, so i would have survived it without having to write my first review in such a smashing fashion. Hate it! After 15 minutes the movie stopped to be interesting to me and was just plain torture."
294,March of the Penguins,6,9 February 2006,Eh,"This is, for better and worse, just one more National Geographic special, which means incredible visual shots, while the verbiage is fit only for a college freshman comp course AT BEST. So what made this such a hit documentary? I'll be ding-busted if I know. I suppose the subject matter had something to do with it. I mean, who can hate nature? Other than the Bush Administration and their cohorts, that is. And really, some of the footage is fantastic: desolate ice-scapes, pristine seas and a moon so sharp and clear that it looks as if it could be touched.Problem: it ain't all like that.Give it a watch, but leave the sound off. And if you want straightforward information on penguin behavior, etc, read a book."
295,March of the Penguins,8,31 July 2005,There is nothing special about this documentary,"I am a huge fans of documentaries ( I watch all of the learning channels like animal planet, discovery and so on...), and national geographic has put out many great documentaries on penguins and I must admit that there is not anything special about this one. I have seen many better documentaries on penguins and this one was not the best, but it was still a very good film. It was amazing to see some of the shots that they got in the Arctic. I do thought still suggest seeing this film because all in all it is a great show and it was great to see a show like this to make it to the theater, and I also suggest seeing winged migration if you enjoyed this film."
296,March of the Penguins,1,18 September 2005,Incredible - as in incredibly boring,"I saw essentially the same story on a nature TV program several years ago. That one took a half hour, which is - as Goldilocks would put it j-u-u-u-u-ust right. . . This one she would have fallen asleep during, so she would have mistaken it for the just right bed.This - THIS - was monumentally SLOW, glacially so. Ohmygod, so slow!And why did they have to have Morgan Freeman use his hypnotist-like, sleep-inducing narration? Couldn't they have spiced it up with SOME enthusiasm? THIS is the movie we all fell asleep in class in 6th grade. I challenge ONE science teacher to show this without half the class sawing logs.This is the most overrated ""small"" movie I can remember.I rate it a 1 here, but would give it a 1.5 if I could. I am not sure why.B-O-O-O-O-ORING. . ."
297,March of the Penguins,1,12 March 2008,I hate penguins,"I hate penguins. That's pretty much the extent of it. This 'movie' is the root of my suffering. Ever since this came out I've been having nightmares about penguin movies. And it wasn't even good. What's worse, they're making a sequel movie. This 'movie' created the penguin problem that we are seeing now. This being the reason for my favorite Futerama episode being the one where they massacre all of the penguins but that's not the point. Penguins are not cute, as they are shown in this 'movie' they are disgusting, nasty, loud, annoying, creatures; just like any other bird. If you really want to learn about penguins do not see this; go watch the discovery channel, do some internet research. Better yet, go pick up one of these devices they invented called books, maybe you've heard of them, I don't know, the Ipod is kind of taking them away, but that's an argument for another time."
298,March of the Penguins,1,6 August 2005,Ugh.,"Dull... Dull... Dull. How do movies such as these gain widespread distribution in COMMERCIAL theaters? My advice: steer the kids way clear of this, and if their heart is set on it... feign convulsions. A brief synopsis: Penquins marching. Ice. Wind. Ice. Snow. Ice. Penguins dancing. Ice. Eggs. Ice. Cold. Hunger. Ice. Marching. Hunger. Ice. Marching. Predators. Ice. Notice a pattern? And on the upside when your kids say I could have seen that on animal planet... you can throw them to your shoulders and offer a quiet: ""yup"". Not the worst movie I've payed 9 USD to see, but surely in the running. But on the flip side, if seeing animals do their thing is your thing, then this... ""thing"" might be for you."
299,March of the Penguins,8,22 April 2010,March of the Penguins,"I may have seen a trailer for this feature, and I certainly remember hearing a lot about it, and I was most keen to see it. With the brilliant and appealing narration of Morgan Freeman, this documentary feature film, made with the help of the National Geographic, is one of the most enchanting real life things ever. It witnesses a flock of Emporer Penguins (apparently meant to have voices to show feelings in another version) as they leave the ocean to march across the ice deserts of Antarctica, where they have lived for centuries, heading for their breeding ground. There, after twenty days of marching, the penguins select a mate for the children they will eventually, and when the mothers do give birth, the eggs pass to the fathers. The mothers travel back to the sea to feed both themselves, and when they return the newborn baby penguins, even with the threat of being eaten by seals. The newborns hatch, and are protected from the cold by the fathers, not all survive, and the mothers that do return to their living children feed their young. The fathers pass the young to the young so that they can feed themselves, which they haven't managed to do for months. Then the mothers go back again, and then the fathers again, and this repeats until the babies have grown big enough to be left alone until they are grown to go to the sea themselves. This process repeats every autumn, and they stay in the sea until that time comes, it should be said also that because the males do not feed as often as the females, that is why there are more females. The sight of these extraordinary creatures marching, hatching and growing up is one of the most beautiful sights you can see, and accompanied with great narration and wonderful music from Alex Wurman, it is a must see for animal and nature documentary lovers. It won the Oscar for Best Documentary, Features, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Editing. Very good!"
300,March of the Penguins,,21 October 2005,Better yet...see 'The Life of Birds' instead of this 'guano',"Only two good things about this movie. The cinematography and the soundtrack. Otherwise a so totally contrived, uncalled for and sickening anthropomorphizing of the penguins. This is not a true natural history/wildlife documentary in any sense of the word. Not even close. I suggest if you want to see true natural history/wildlife documentaries that you seek out and watch the works of the renowned Naturalist and the greatest man to ever to produce natural history/wildlife film documentaries ever, Sir David Attenborough. He would never sink so low as to try and anthropomorphize animals as the writers, producers and directors of this film have."
301,March of the Penguins,6,29 August 2005,"Beautiful cinematography, but...","""In the harshest place on Earth, love finds a way...""Make that: In the harshest of climates, animals will do what they have to do to perpetuate their species...""March of the Penguins is ""beautiful,"" and interestingly shot by photographers who have clearly ingested their share of psychedelic drugs, but the narrative and schmaltzy melodramatic music is ill-making. The narrative centers around anthropomorphized penguin family values. It's also very hazy (or mute) on facts.Thousands of Emperor penguins trudge interminably to their mating/nesting area--70 long miles away...from...? Well, from some other place they also live. But that's apparently not important to this story. There are lots of shots of the trudging. At first it's amusing--from a distance the penguins look like monks or vagrants in trenchcoats--but after a short time it's monotonous.So, once they walk 70 miles, the penguins get down the task of finding a mate. That is, many of them do. The narrator tells us that there are more females than males. How many more? We aren't told. Why do some females get to mate and others don't? Is it age? Is it aggression? Is it overall physical fitness? Dunno--didn't say. Morgan Freeman implies that the males and females hook up because some cosmic soul-mateishness is at work. So, these soul-connected birds mate for life? Um, no. But ANYWAY, the male and female pairs snuggle and make sounds at each other (like most any creatures about to mate, frankly), and we're told they are ""in love, about to start their very own family"" Freeman coos that they are ""monogamous,"" when actually that just means, for that one particular mating season, they mate only with one other penguin. Not a lot of hopping from bird to bird, as it were. Much schmaltzy music and Morgan Freeman narrative about this wondrous romance between the birds. OK. So what happens with the females without mates? Don't ask me. I guess they watch, and shiver?Some period of time after they mate--how long? ehhhh? how long do they hang out and mate? ummm?--the female lays one egg and then passes it over to the male who must balance the egg on his feet for 4 months while the females go off to Club Med, eat a lot of fish, and recuperate. The females first must trudge 70 miles back to the ocean to do so. They have lost 40% of their body weight. So how many make it? Got me! Freeman didn't say. We're just treated to wobbling penguins going on and on and on and...So when the females eventually get back to the breeding ground they show a bird with a tear in its eye upon seeing its little one for the first time. Come on! Morgan Freeman tells us that when the now literally half-starved males, who haven't eaten in 4 months, must leave their newly hatched check to go back the 70 miles to the ocean it's ""the hardest thing they will ever have to do after having bonded with their little babies."" The images don't bear it out. You just see the male roll the egg over to the female and start the 70-mile trudge again.And after all this stuff of love and family values...the females don't seem all that interested in the ""babies,"" and when an unnamed predator (I think it must have been an albatross) starts sniping at the chicks the mothers just kind of look on, dumb as chickens. No one tries to intervene or even squawks. The males come back, and Freeman speaks of happy reunions, but the images don't bear that out. The penguins all just sort of wander around or huddle in big groups. Then they show all the penguins trudging the damn 70 miles again--with the now-mangy-looking adolescent chicks falling behind (how many make it? do the predators get many of them? dunno)--the adults leave them, and Freeman tells us that the chicks will now ""take to the sea for 5 years until they can begin their journey to find love and start their own families."" What? They can't just take to the sea! They live on land. What do they do for 5 years? Not important, since you probably can't imbue it with human emotion.Never explained is why they walk 70 damn miles in the first place? What would happen if they stayed at their seaside resort? What about global warming melting their habitat? Has that affected the Emperor penguin population at all (it has, but the film neglects that probably because it would offend those in denial about global warming).I'd rent it when it comes out on DVD, with the sound off.The ""making of"" extras will be fascinating. As said, the cinematography is astonishing, and the filmmakers apparently went to unprecedented ends to get some of the rare shots you see here."
302,March of the Penguins,5,9 August 2005,Great show - but not for small children!!,"After watching the commercials for this movie and the praises that this was a movie for the entire family, I took three of my grandchildren (ages 8, 5, and 4) this past Sunday afternoon, thinking this was going to be an entertaining movie for all... My oldest grandchild seemed to enjoy it, even though it was a documentary, but he learned some interesting things about their journey to the breeding ground, but my younger granddaughter, who is 4, was totally upset when the eggs started cracking and freezing the babies, and when some died after birth, and then the attack from the large bird trying to kill one of the babies. She and my middle grandson, who's 5, were bored for most of the movie.As a documentary, I thought it was very informative, but I feel that it shouldn't be advertised as a movie for the entire family."
303,March of the Penguins,4,10 July 2005,almost killed myself,"stupid french turned this documentary into a depressive fest... could there be anymore remarks to death, die, never come back, frozen to death, eaten by predators, winter, harshest winter, the most harshest ever, the worst is yet to come... give me a break. among the boring sounds of the same stupid repeating music you have repeating images of the penguins bobbing their heads and standing in the 'harsh polar wind'. There are some pokes of fun here and there, some fake sound-effects. But half the movie is spent on the harshness of winter and fragility of their life. Don't take your kids to see this. i want my 1 hour 30 minutes back. oh and my money."
304,March of the Penguins,1,1 January 2006,Pure Crap,This is the most boring movie i have ever seen.... I went with a huge group of people (maybe 10) we ALL hated it.... it is the most boring movie..... I wanted to kill myself....Don't bother with this crap Its just about a baby being born and ...well....thats it..... seriously.... don't see this! A huge waste of film Thisshould be rated R for intense BOREDOM AND TORTURE!I don't really see how a movie could be worse then this....even napoleon dynamite was better...its just about a mother penguin going to get food .....THATS ALL!I'm telling you...if you see this.... you are asking for torture and the most boring movie EVER!
305,March of the Penguins,1,18 September 2005,Do Not Take Kids To See This!,"This was the most horribly boring movie I've ever seen in my life, and trust me, I've seen them all. I saw the commercial previews for this with all kinds of little kids oohing and ahhing, and it was billed as a cute family movie. It's a documentary. The kids (8 and 12) were fidgeting and acting up after ten minutes and kept wanting to know when the ""real"" movie started -- and so did I! We had to leave the theater after half an hour of this nightmare droning on and on when it became apparent that's all there would be. This is not a children's movie or even a family movie. It's like a horrible re-run on The Nature Channel, and Morgan Freeman's narration can't change the fact that there's no plot, no action, no comedy, and no entertainment whatsoever. Now, I'm not the kind of American idiot who thinks ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is high comedy -- but March of the Penguins is not a movie at all as we understand the term; it's a documentary about nature's creatures that doesn't pretend to be anything else. I honestly don't understand why it's being marketed as a family film."
306,March of the Penguins,4,10 September 2005,"Very disappointing, primitive and flawed","I mean... have we really reached the spot where documentaries about nature can't go on without animals killing each other (in this case baby penguins)or do we necessary have to watch animals making out while a romantic music plays as though it was an erotic film... Have we really reached the point where we call this a family movie? I think it is really sad because it was an okay movie despise these places that really made my stomach turn twice, and then it gets 8.0 from viewers and I am one of the only who had these opinions. I think it's very sad that I can't go and relax 1 hour without realizing what really interests people.."
307,March of the Penguins,,15 July 2005,Burning Question,"It kept running through my mind while looking at this informative documentary: why a 70+ mile trek? Why not one, or even a half mile? Just what was there in that distant vicinity that relegated the males initially to that area? Why, Mother Nature, do things the hard way--or is it the penguins that may be a bit on the daft side? So, there they go, hobbling and waddling over so many torturous miles--with round trips, no less.Granted the big ""birds"" are fetching, like waiters in formal attire. And the ""role-switching"" for the egg incubating is a gasser. Still, 85 minutes felt about 30 too long. What this seems, actually, is a National Geographic TV Special, without commercial breaks. And since NG always does a consistently fine job, it's up to high tech standards.It's just that after 45 minutes or so, I was ready to leave there and go visit the apes, elephants, and refreshment stand."
308,March of the Penguins,7,14 September 2008,Good film,"This film has even inspired a political controversy, with Right Wing advocates claiming that the annual 'monogamy' the male and female engage in supports their view that the nuclear family unit is ordained by God, and that Emperor penguins are proof of 'Intelligent Design', even though they are clearly marvelous products of adaptive development. Gay rights activists have countered the Right's claims by noting that female penguins often steal the chicks of other females if theirs dies, and that lower animals do not feel human emotions like love, but merely act instinctively, sometimes engaging in same sex sexual play- which is not 'homosexuality', which would imply that penguins are sexually turned on my male humans. Much of this misinterpretation of penguin behavior, as presented in this film, seeped over into the fawning critical reception of this film. Indeed, while the film is enjoyable, it is so only a Disney/Pixar level, for it almost plays out like one of those computer animated films, not a real nature documentary.Yes, the penguins suffer through conditions that would kill humans in seconds, seventy mile treks across ice, male and female sharing of the caring of the egg and chick, both of which would freeze if not for a warm parental pouch to crawl into, huddling for warmth in 125 mile per hour winds at -80° Fahrenheit, months of starvation, but these are not the makings of drama, because true drama requires conscious actors. Yet, many reviews of the film contain terms like 'lovemaking', 'bravery', and 'fortitude', only further confusing the boundaries between fiction and reality, even as the film never focuses on an individual bird nor couple, the way most documentaries do, knowing that is the way to emotionally invest a viewer in a story. Instead, this film merely relies on the cuteness of the penguins, and especially their fuzzy chicks., who, by summertime, will be abandoned by both parents, and left to fend for themselves for four years, before they return again to their birthing grounds, to give birth to the next generation of their kind.Cinematographers Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison do get some incredible pictures, especially those underwater shots of agile female penguins swiftly trying to outswim a seal that's out to eat them, as they try to fatten up on small fish, squid, and krill, to bring back and feed their chicks. Yet, the Emperor penguins transcend this film's limitations. They are silly looking yet beautiful creatures: their black and white feathers are so densely packed they resemble the gloss on fine china, and the orange marks near their pates are so rich in color they dazzle in the blinding white of the ice, but the dull classical (or New Age?) musical score by Alex Wurman is one of the few aspects of the film that has rightly and universally been panned. Supposedly the original French version of the film had much more contemporary and apropos music by Emilie Simon.Regardless, while March Of The Penguins may be solid enjoyable kiddy fare, no adult should expect to be much enlightened, for the natural and documentary parts of this 'nature documentary' seem to have been CG'd to death. Check out PBS or cable TV for more science-based nature films. Spin, Marlin, spin."
309,March of the Penguins,10,20 June 2007,Nothing Short of Brilliant,"French director Luc Jacquet's new film ""March of the Penguins"" (**** out of ****), a superb, 80-minute, G-rated, National Geographic-funded documentary about the gallant Emperor Penguin should appeal to hopeless romantics looking for the ultimate date movie. Were it not for Morgan Freeman's engaging narration and Jacquet's painstaking efforts at filming these flightless marine birds on celluloid in their own harsh habitat under the worst conditions imaginable, 'Penguins"" would amount to nothing more than a pictorially impressive but thoroughly routine Discovery Channel episode for the big screen. Originally, for its Sundance Film Festival debut last January, Jacquet ascribed human characteristics to the stout-hearted, black & white aviary. In other words, he anthropomorphized them. Meaning, Jacquet dubbed in human voices, so that the tux-colored birds could share their sentiments with audiences about the mysteries of life. Ugh, what a sappy saga that version must have been! Happily, ""Penguins"" U.S. distributor, Warner Independent Pictures, scrapped the dubbed voices and let the birds communicate in their own unique language. Mind you, the narrative script that Jordan Roberts penned for Morgan Freeman isn't entirely bereft of sentimentality, but it doesn't detract from the drama as much as the original version must have.What distinguishes ""March of the Penguins"" from most mindless summer movie fare is its entertaining but offbeat factual substance. This scenic snow-swept chronicle about the mind-boggling mating ritual of penguins is utterly fascinating. Once a year, emperor penguins abandon their coastal feeding grounds and march single file across 70 miles of frozen wasteland into the Antarctic interior to a safe, isolated spot where they choose partners, procreate, and provide for their chicks. Traditionally, in human society, mothers exert a greater role in birthing and raising infants. Penguins approach parenthood with a different philosophy and participate in raising their offspring with greater equality in their parental duties than the rigid, asymmetrical characteristic of humans. Female penguins each lay one egg. Rather than incubating it, the mama passes the egg over to the papa. Balancing the fragile egg on her huge gnarly feet, the mama penguin conceals it beneath the folds of her warm, furry abdomen. When the she passes the egg to papa, she shuffles up to him and nudges it gingerly off the top of her feet onto his feet without it ever touching the icy ground. If the egg ends up on the ground, the baby penguin chick is surely doomed. Teetering the egg on his own gnarly feet, the papa warms it for two months, allowing the mamas to head back to their coastal feeding grounds to chow down. After they've stuffed themselves on a buffet of cold seafood, they return to feed their hatched young. While the mamas are off gorging themselves, the papas huddle together in vast crowds for shared bodily warmth and keep the eggs toasty until the chick hatches. The male birds endure two months or more of rugged icy weather, going without food, to incubate the egg. After the chick breaks out of the egg, the papa continues to keep in safe and warm in his abdominal folds until the chick's chubby mama finally shows up to feed it.""March of the Penguins"" succeeds admirably both as an enlightening documentary about penguins as well as a dramatically skewed but satisfying love story. Mind you, these animals have been blindly repeating this genetically programmed ritual since the first penguins appeared, so they aren't really as romantic as Jacquet, Jordan, and Freeman want us to believe. Nevertheless, ""Penguins"" entertains us because their blind obedience to Mother Nature stands out in stark contrast to our own choice-driven human nature. In a sense, these birds emerge as worthy role models for anybody that aspires to parenthood, and the penguins' dedication to their offspring makes them appear far nobler than some humans. At the same time, Jacquet doesn't whitewash the perils in this epic adventure. He presents both sides of a Darwinistic tale of survival that proves alternately heartwarming but heartbreaking. Not only does Jacquet show the birds battling for survival against severe inclement environmental conditions, but also he deals with the predators that the penguins confront. However, the filmmakers don't dwell unduly on those unsavory aspects. Similarly, Jacquet's film doesn't indulge in penguin porn like a 1960's Mondo-style European documentary might have. Perverts will just have to settle for only a glimpse of penguin sex. Some images of baby penguin corpses might not go down well for ages under five. Catch the amusing end credits, and you'll see Jacquet and his heavily bundled-up camera crew filming hordes of penguins at close range. Shrewdly, Jacquet and his crew photographed the penguins at the bird's eye-level so that audiences can identify with them to a greater extent. The imperturbable aviary approaches one cinematographer and curiously stares at his super-16mm camera. Lensers Laurent Chalet and Jerome Madison--along with Jacquet--braved the rigors of the Antarctic for 13 months to record some of the best footage that you'll ever eyeball of the emperor penguin. For the record, ""March of the Penguins"" has grossed over $30-million at the box office in America already and has become the second most successful movie documentary in film history, though it trails far behind the current champ, director Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" Watching ""March of the Penguins,"" however, is not the onerous burden that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" proved with its incendiary tabloid quality."
310,March of the Penguins,,14 April 2007,A better documentary than love story ...,"This was a nice show, but it was essentially a documentary about Emperor penguins' breeding process. Having the gentle voice of Morgan Freeman is a nice touch.Basically, the show covers the mating/breeding/hatching of Emperor penguins. It's an amazing process, but if you're familiar with it already, watching this movie will be a bit slow.In the US, a lot of programs that cover this process have been shown on the National Geographic and Discovery channels.If you aren't familiar with subject matter, then the movie will no doubt be fascinating to watch. An added bonus are the great visuals of Antarctica and penguin life."
311,March of the Penguins,7,7 February 2007,Amazing film-making... but OY!!  That narrative...,"The cinematography is breathtaking, and what these filmmakers endured for months to bring this story to us is equally impressive. However, the narration anthropomorphizes the penguins when it's convenient. One such line had me literally rolling my eyes, when, after a mother breaks her unhatched egg, the narrative opines, ""The loss is unbearable"" or ""devastating"" or some other such dramatic nonsense, while the penguin stands there cluelessly, with the same vacant expression; clearly NOT devastated. The tag line of the movie, about this being a love story, love conquering all, blah blah blah, is equally full of crap. Yes, the emperor penguin is monogamous, but only serially so; they seek out and find a different mate each year, a fact glossed over by both this movie and those who would seek to find some parallels between these flightless birds and human relationships.The tendency to anthropomorphize, however, is dumped with equal convenience when dozens of large, adult penguins stand around stupidly while another bird methodically harasses, attacks, then finally kills one of the penguin chicks. The adult penguins, who are every bit as large as the predatory bird (and FAR more numerous) do absolutely nothing, standing there like great tuxedoed statues. The plucky, clown-like music that normally plays when the chicks are on screen (to let you know, hey, they're cute!) is nowhere to be heard while the babies are being picked off easily with no interference from their parents. These are the same loving parental birds who suffered ""unbearable loss"" when an egg got cracked? Come on.These birds, like most animals, are driven by instinct, not love, to reproduce. Apart from this serious flaw, in my opinion, the story itself (as shown, and untainted by flowery prose) is magnificent. Why they felt they had to embellish it is quite beyond me. These birds go to extreme limits in an unbelievably harsh environment to reproduce. That story alone, and the brilliant, sweeping shots of Antarctica, make this film very good."
312,March of the Penguins,7,17 January 2007,Competent but not outstanding wildlife documentary,"Watched the Morgan Freeman voiced English Language Version. As it was American-written I was dreading that it would be an overly sentimental piece which owed more to Disney type anthropomorphism than the genuine insightful documentary you would hope for from a production bearing the imprint of National Geographic.When one of the very first lines spoke about it being a story about love, my heart sank. I tried to put this dread feeling to one side as I watched the rest of the film.Although there is no gushing blood , the reality of death is not avoided and on the whole it is an interesting and educational film. (Although, I am still left wondering what happens to the corpses of the penguins.) I am afraid that I do not understand the fuss made over what is a competent but not outstanding wildlife documentary - the like of which can be seen on the BBC and various satellite channels any day of the week.I have read that this film as being seen as evidence of Intelligent design. Difficult to see where the intelligence comes in."
313,March of the Penguins,4,19 December 2006,Did I miss a memo?,"I mean, it was a good documentary. But it was a documentary. You know those things you fall asleep in. Which I did the first time. The second time I was forced to watch. The third time, I just decided to skip the whole ordeal and go make myself a sandwich. That's a story of survival if I've ever heard of one. But seriously, I do not comprehend why everyone loves this documentary. It has good footage I must admit. Best I've ever seen for a documentary. But in the end it comes down to basically being a PBS special with Morgan Freeman narrating which is supposed to be the Godsend of this movie. So I guess I missed the memo, because I don't even see why that makes it special. Anyone short of Paris Hilton could narrate this film without making it much more abrasive to the ears than the monotonousity of the fact that it is a documentary. So for the amazing footage of penguins I'll give it a 6. Minus 2 for everyone overhyping Morgan Freeman's voice."
314,March of the Penguins,5,18 December 2006,March of the Penguins with voice-over for the dutch language.,"My comments cover the version of March of the Penguins, with voice-over for the dutch language. The sum of the total defines the quality of a documentary.In case of March of the Penguins, the idea and the filming was superb. But good work can change completely with a wrong choice of music that does not fit nor support the subject of the film and when the film is accompanied by absurd voice-over text that places the subject in the wrong day-light. A voice that comments as if you are talking to children (the actual dutch comments were not accepted by this comment system). That is really annoying. One and a half hour we get cheesy voice over from a Belgium comedian talking baby-language. That does the 'documentary' no good. The subject (and audience) is made ridiculous.But imagine this quality film work with the voice of Sir David Attenborough that would have been a real winner and a real reason for being the best documentary of 2006."
315,March of the Penguins,7,2 October 2006,not brilliant,"This film was a slight disappointment but I feel that one should not have high expectations for such a simple film. The filmmakers did a wonderful job in capturing the Emperor penguins in perhaps the harshest conditions on Earth. The penguins slip and slide out of the water, onto ice, and back again and the shots are quite stunning. However, the narration by Morgan Freeman is unnecessary and at times, annoying. This is, in some ways, a children's film, yet some of the scenes may be quite disturbing for younger viewers. If one wants to see a superior film about birds (including penguins), I would recommend ""Winged Migration"". In fact, ""March of the Penguins"" incorporates very similar shots, particular the gruesome scene where the albatross eats the baby penguins. For some reason, when some viewers may want to actually be informed, the narration is silenced. This film is very simple entertainment with some beautiful shots; but with a running time of approximately one hour and twenty minutes, I wouldn't run out tonight to rent it."
316,March of the Penguins,3,23 September 2006,boring,"Birds are not very nice, especially when they freeze and die before your very eyes. They certainly noticed the cameras, so the least they could have done was stay alive for the benefit of everyone watching. Also, birds can do lots of tricks and many of them can talk to you. These birds, however, stayed true to inconsiderate form and didn't say a word. Now if the babies had looked into the camera and said ""I love you,"" my heart would have melted. But did they? Nope. Shiver and squawk. That's all you're going to get. And there aren't any polar bears, which is a bad surprise for people who like polar bears and reasonably assumed there would be bears because of all the ice on the cover of the DVD box. Let me tell you--sad realization. So overall, I give this a not very good score because I don't think it is very good."
317,March of the Penguins,10,29 August 2006,Absolutely Superb!!,"If you are thinking about seeing this movie i would get it now. When I first saw the trailers i thought it was a bit pointless to go and see but after it won the Oscar i was determined to see what all the hype was about. So the other day I went out and bought it and to my surprise it is now one of my favorite films. Its amazing, the only way to describe it. Its cute, educational, interesting, heart-warming, funny at times and slightly upsetting! But to see how these fascinating animals go on such an amazing journey is brilliant. Its nothing like you would expect and is a masterpiece. I would highly recommend to see this. It is a truly a beautiful look in on how such different creatures have to live their lives."
318,March of the Penguins,5,29 July 2006,"Great Photography, Great Story -- But Enough Already","Much of ""March of the Penguins"" is a miracle of film making. The photography, under unimaginably harsh conditions, is incomparable. The evolutionary struggle of the Emperor Penguins to reproduce is little short of miraculous. The narrative -- by Morgan Freeman in the American version -- is both well written and beautifully read. But, without denying credit or money to the producers and distributors for having had such a commercial success, the film could (and should) have told the story more briefly. And it belonged on the Discovery Channel not in theaters because the back-and-forth of the parents from breeding grounds to the sea to sustain their own lives and that of the chicks gets quite repetitive. Along around the middle of the film, I had ooo-ed and ahh-ed enough and learned as much as I was going to learn, and I got more than a little bored. (One important question that the film failed to answer is how long Emperor Penguins live and how frequently they reproduce during their lifetimes. With all the dead chicks and the deaths of the parents, once is obviously not enough to sustain the herd. Other than that, I felt that I was told all I really needed to know.) Don't get me wrong. I think this is a great documentary -- possibly the best nature documentary ever made. But it's a documentary, not a feature film, and it would have served better at documentary length. As a documentary, it would easily deserve a 10. As a feature film, I rated it a 5. That may strike a lot of you as unfair but it's how I felt at the end. The film had overstayed its welcome."
319,March of the Penguins,8,1 June 2006,Murder Ball should have murdered this at the Oscars,"I do not understand how this beat Murderball.OK, i admit it is a great journey that the penguins go through, but the guys in Murderball were freaking insane. I found Murderball to be way more emotional and powerful.Don't get me wrong i like March of the Penguins, but at many points the flow of the story became very slow and a little bit boring where as Murderball was completely in your face. As i watched Murderball I didn't feel sorry for the guys as most Doc makers would probably have done it, but i actually felt proud of these people who show you that even with such problems they can be so damn strong."
320,March of the Penguins,9,20 May 2006,Stunning Cinematography,"I have always been an animal enthusiast, and so naturally I was looking forward to this film very much. I have to say, I was not disappointed at all. Right from the start, it is a beautiful thing to see - and hear. Morgan Freeman's voice is perfect for this film. And the narration is just right; not too much unnecessary 'banter'. But much as I admire Mr Freeman, that is nothing to the breathtaking scenery, captured so perfectly by Monsieur Jacquet & co. Right form the start, you forget that these creatures are, lets be honest, less than graceful on land. There is one particular scene, showing a courtship ritual, where I was virtually moved to tears, as the penguins appeared so elegant. They always appear to be graceful and poised, especially when tending their young. And I must admit that for me the young are the stars of the show. Their antics are shown with such humour that the viewer is left in little doubt that the crew truly enjoyed filming them. And as if the entertainment value of this film is not enough, it is also educational.The viewer is a great insight into the hardship of antarctic life, even in summer! All in all, I would say this is the best film I have seen this year, and the best natural history feature length I have ever seen."
321,March of the Penguins,,7 May 2006,too long,"this film seemed like it was gonna be a master piece but when i sat down, popcorn in hand, about half an hour later i found myself falling asleep..the film was cute and heartfelt but seemed to be re telling the same story over and over again!!!!!! it introduces you to the life of the penguin but also seems to go through every season of the year as well!!!! it could have been at least an hour shorter and the narration was boring and in imaginative also!!! i would have recommended this if it was in the form of a television documentary but definitely not as a motion picture!!! i give this film a 10/10 for information 4/10 for audience interest and over all....i give it a 5/10..."
322,March of the Penguins,5,29 April 2006,Extremely Dull,"Beautiful photography.Spectacular Scenery.Morgan Freeman, enough said.But this movie is so slow.It has been billed as a child movie here in Texas. I can tell you that it is an extremely bad idea to take small children to this movie. It is long and dull. It holds children's' attention for mere seconds. I know others find this to be a great movie... But I sincerely found this to be a very blah, movie. Either way, check it out for yourself. But it was definitely not my style of documentary."
323,March of the Penguins,5,20 April 2006,I would have liked it more if I saw it for free on TV!,"Wow, I must admit, for basically being the type of documentary you's see on Animal Planet, the creators struck gold with the Penguin loving public! I love nature, and I have nothing against penguins, but I fail to see why so many people go gaga over the clumsy flightless birds, who don't really seem like birds at all. I wonder if they are cold blooded, like most birds... Maybe not. The problem with March...is that there are almost no facts about the Penguins physiology! Instead we get the WAY OVER-USED Morgan Freeman doing the voice-over narration that doesn't really give many relevant facts. Also, we get overdramtic pap about the Penguins love and anguish and so on... They anthropomorphise the penguins too much! Most Americans must eat this up, but to me it seemed too manipulative. My gut tells me that the birds are simply following instincts, since their brains are so small. I doubt they have emotions like us. Also, why must the penguins travel so far to breed? It was NEVER EXPLAINED! I rated the movie a 5 because the cinematography was very nice. I probably would have liked it better on mute. On a side note, the trailer they showed for ""Happy Feet"", basically computer generated penguins dancing like Bing Crosby, made me want to vomit!"
324,March of the Penguins,6,15 March 2006,beautifully shot but with a near-fatal flaw...,"I must first point out that I have only seen this film in its original French version (on DVD) so my comments refer to the French voice-overs and music.To keep it brief, this is a beautiful piece of cinematography with carefully composed frames and an enchanting/mystifying subject matter. But the whole experience is reduced from the awe-inspiring to the slightly awful by the painfully bad music of Emilie Simon. Of course, there's no accounting for taste and some people loved it - but from the moment she opened her mouth during the opening over-fly sequence, both my wife and I were cringing. The backing music is pleasant but by no means inspiring, but her puerile lyrics and bad-Bjork sounds were grating whenever they were featured. And I am a huge fan of electronic music and also enjoy Bjork so this is not a genre-judgement.Anyway, I just felt that, in the right hands (saw Tetsuo Inoue / Pete Namlook, Greg Hunter / Youth or even William Orbit) the soundtrack could have lived up to the imagery"
325,March of the Penguins,7,22 January 2006,National Geographic does a better job,"I enjoyed this film, but I really thought that it offered little more than a regular NG film or some discovery channel 84 minute special. I loved every minute of the film, but continually I was waiting for the filmmakers to show something I hadn't seen before in every other wildlife film. Am I missing something here? Or is this just a generic wildlife film that has been well promoted and received? I thought even some imaginative work with characters or insights into what makes this situation any different from what most species do to survive in extreme climates. If you want to watch a film that is interesting, heart warming, enchanting and visually beautiful, certainly watch this film...just know that you'll find the same from nearly every program on the discovery channel."
326,March of the Penguins,4,15 January 2006,Awful music spoils wonderful subject,"While the documentary genre is evolving from TV to the big screen, and we see a general increase in quality, this movie to some extent represents a missed chance.The emperor penguin is a fascinating subject and its Antarctic location is splendid. This almost guarantees pretty pictures for the courageous few who take their movie cameras to the coldest continent.Certainly, the filmmaker deserves credit for going to a lot of trouble to present the whole life cycle of the penguin to a large audience in a full length movie.However, after watching this movie one wonders if something better could have been made out of the raw material. The photography is good, but the editing mediocre.Most of all, the irritating music track with its sentimental songs (sometimes off-key) drowns out the natural sounds of the Antarctic, thereby partially ruining the true documentary character of the movie.The commentaries in the different language versions are different. Reportedly, the French commentary has different voices including a babylike voice. The Norwegian version fortunately does not subject its viewers to this. It has one male narrator."
327,March of the Penguins,,9 December 2005,"penguins yes, script no","it's true this is a nature movie like on TV. and the voice-over gets off on the wrong foot from the get go ""maybe they were stubborn, maybe they thought the climate changes were temporary"" we're told about the penguins still living on the south pole. maybe you should just shut up since your reflections, possibly intended to be humorous are so moronic, I thought. I liked the material of this film, the little darlin penguins were fantastic, but the movie was a bore as has been commented on by many. . . I'd like to know if the gay penguins just get out of the water, have their gay sex right there, then jump back in and skip the whole marching business!"
328,March of the Penguins,7,3 December 2005,Celebration of Life...,"For a documentary, this movie is simply great combined with a powerful narration from Morgan Freeman. I got this movie from the video store without any expectations but I was totally surprised as I started watching it. At no point could I afford get up and say ""Oh! just a documentary"". The movie is certain to lift the spirits of the most depressed because if these penguins can survive it all, mankind can! One sentence I thought I heard moved me ""the ones in the center take turns to stand in the outer ring to let the existing ones come in for warmth"". I really wish people in the world had that feeling today and life would be worth more celebrating."
329,March of the Penguins,5,1 October 2005,Average National Geographic Movie,"I guess if your the type of person to like animals and love National Geographic, I suggest you go see this film then. Basically, I felt like I was watching some documentary on the discovery channel, from which I can watch at home (and I never really do), but there were interesting points, though not worth paying $10 to see and hear.I have to admit the baby penguins were cute though. So over all, I wouldn't call it the ""best"" documentary, I think some of Michael Moore's documentaries should be the best, but it was average.I guess It's just one of those films either you love it or hate it. For films like that, I prefer to watch on Movie Central (movie channels) or rent or whatever it may be."
330,March of the Penguins,6,18 September 2005,Don't mind the story,"After the Canadian's hit documentary ""Winged Migration,"" here comes another documentary about ""silly"" (or determined) birds: ""March of the Penguins."" I watched the French version, without the dubbed narrator voice by Morgan Freeman. I don't know how much that affects how I receive this film. Perhaps a lot, because I wish the film had just simply showed me the images, which is incredible, without all the corny narrative.The film is about these silly but lovely emperor penguins who travel in a single file for miles in the sub-zero temperature to inland in order to mate. Why can they just do it next to the beach? Nobody is watching. After mothers lay eggs, they left the eggs to fathers, and they travel back to the ocean looking for food. Those fathers will starve themselves for months while hatching the eggs, in blizzards. I think Americans dads need to learn a lot from these male penguins. Now get this: after those mothers are back, without cell phone, without email, without name tags, they can find their one night stand ""husbands"" in the sea of penguins after being away for a few months. How did they do it? Or can they? Well, that's what the film is telling us.How can you tell those penguins apart? How can we be sure that the mothers are coming back to the male penguins they have mated before they left? The film is so wonderful to look at and you can't help but to like these adorable penguins, just don't get serious about the story lines."
331,March of the Penguins,7,8 September 2005,Eh...,"Had I been flipping channels and this had popped up on the Discovery Channel, I would have stopped to watch. Now is this really worth a theatrical release and all of they accompanying hype? Not so much. I was really expecting some spectacular visuals and camera work, but it all seemed a little marginal. As far as a ""story"", there wasn't enough give for any compassion. Did I cry when the chicks were being attacked by the Albatross? No, and the Penguin mothers didn't seem to care much either. As far as a ""documentary"", it did not deliver enough information. I was left with far more questions. The documentary definitely had some interesting facts(?) but it was no where as moving as its being hyped up to be."
332,March of the Penguins,,4 September 2005,Not very engaging,"The hype for this film is incredible! I love this sort of story and count Winged Migration as one of my favorite and often-viewed films. I am afraid Penguins is not in that league. There are many reasons from the uninvolved narration to the leaden pace. But mainly the story is interesting without being engaging. I found my mind wandering and I wanted something to happen. The lugubrious pacing and repetition along with the questionable interpretation of the penguins motives - love, sacrifice, etc. made me wish the 80 minutes had sped by faster. So much of the ""premise"" was destroyed by clearly visible contradictions. The males/females love the chicks but do nothing to protect them from predators, abandon them before they are grown, etc. Okay, it is nature and I cannot expect sentimentality but then the ""premise"" of the love story is contradicted. I can only marvel at what happens, be glad someone filmed it and be puzzled by the inefficiency and risk involved in perpetuating the species. I also wonder if some of the underwater scenes were digital representations. I cannot prove it but some of it looked a little fake. I loved the penguins but this film did not do them justice."
333,March of the Penguins,7,21 August 2005,"Good, but really slow in parts","I wish I had liked this movie better. As much admiration as I have for the men who braved the conditions of the South Pole to make this film, I have as little admiration for the editor. Yes, learning about the penguins is fascinating. Yes, seeing the baby penguins is great. Learning about the dangers they faced in order to mate and raise chicks was very intriguing.But the 20 minutes of film time given over to the landscape was a total waste. I know what Antarctica looks like...but here you get to see it over and over and over and over, to some of the most overbearing music I've ever heard in a film. I can't remember ever looking at my watch so much in a film.So, to sum up:Morgan Freeman Narration -- 10Actual film time about the penguins -- 10 Actual film time about the baby penguins -- 10++Long, drawn out shots of the landscape, repeated ad nauseum -- 2(What I really want to see is a ""Making Of"" of this film. Now that would be interesting. You get to see some of it in the closing credits)"
