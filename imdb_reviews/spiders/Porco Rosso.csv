0,Porco Rosso,10,22 December 2005,More than a movie,"Porco Rosso is not just one of those movies that you watch and give back to Netflix. It is one of those movies that genuinely makes you hate your life, but in a good way. Watching a movie like Porco Rosso makes you wish that you lived in their world, and that you could fly your own plane between the Adriatic Islands and your own private hideaway. It is the kind of film that takes you inside it and leaves you with a sort of culture shock when you are forced to realize that you are in your modern-day room with no way to get around but a car or a bike. It is the sort of movie that you watch again not only because you love it so much, but also so that you can have a portal back into that magical world and dream that you can become like one of the characters in the movie with some sort of ""reality"". Who cares if there are flaws? Is the world absolutely perfect? So what if there is ambiguity about the ending? Is life always crystal clear? Porco Rosso is one of those movies that has the perfect mix of reality and fantasy; it gives you a world that you wish you were a part of, and COULD be, if only you can find it...."
1,Porco Rosso,10,4 July 2005,A magical European adventure that is too real to brand a cartoon. A  visual splendor - the imagination of an artist unequaled in the animation world.,"Over the decades, Japan has established itself in the animation scene as a contender, creating some of the most mind boggling realistic, detailed animation the world has ever seen. However, Japan had primarily made cartoons involving their traditional, cultural and supernatural themes that the world felt alienated to.It wasn't until a great artist came along in the mid-1970s that was to make Disney look like a second class citizen in the animation business. Hayao Miyazaki was Japan's inspiration to open their eyes to new horizons and show the world their hand in art. His first motion picture released in the late 70s was Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro, which proved to be a world success. From that point on, he created some of the most memorable, brilliant and detailed masterpieces the western world ever saw - most having something to do with world issues and human's spiritual touch with nature. It wasn't until I saw Porco Rosso that I found my oasis in animation, a film that has no reason to be a cartoon due to its sheer realism and setting.The premise is simple, subtle and imaginatively compelling. The story follows a humanoid pig known as Porco Rosso ('Crimson Pig' in English Translation), a bush pilot during the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s when Mussolini was a strong ally with Hitler. Whilst war is on the brink of initiation, Bush Pilot 'Pirates' roam the Italian coast, robbing ships, tourists and living the life few people could experience. Among these gambling, thieving, dirty pirates however, Porco Rosso stands as the ace pilot and feared by all. As he threatens the welfare of all the pirates, particularly the Mamma Aiuto Gang, the price on his head sky rockets. The only thing that lies between him and the pirates is a beautiful woman named Madame Gina, the singer and proprietor of an island resort popular with all the pilots that come through. Gina loves Porco since childhood, when he was a real human, and cannot bare to lose yet another close one, like her previous husbands. Both Porco's and Gina's world is turned upside down when an American ace pilot named Curtis intrudes into their lives, insisting on making a name for himself as he plans to fight Porco in an air battle all the while falling in love with Gina.......the American way.Porco's subsequent adventures lead him to discover something about himself, about those important to him and about letting go of his constant turmoil and guilt of events that have haunted him for years, as he meets new characters that open his eyes and return him to what he once was.........just a human.Rarily has an adventure movie been so fun, rich and captivating as Porco Rosso in addition to its overwhelmingly brilliant animation. Like I said before, there is no reason for this film to be a cartoon, but because it is and because it was realized in the way that it was, this is what makes it a masterpiece among World Animation.The story, being very simple, could be taken on many levels with its inner meaning and symbolism. You forget that you are watching a cartoon after 5 minutes. It takes itself mildly seriously and the comic relief is timed to perfection. The characters vividly come to life and drain you of your emotions with each of their stories. The world Hayao Miyazaki creates is so real, that you are inevitably drawn into it. The magnificent romantic and exotic music and attention to authenticity make the film's atmosphere so convincing and breathtaking - the music always suiting at the right moments. I hardly believed this was a Japanese film, considering it felt completely like a European production. But no, only Hayao Miyazaki could accomplish such feats as to utilize your imagination and transport you to another world without any reference to his origins. That is his gift. This was evident ever since his motion picture debut. He has made many brilliant films, but Porco Rosso is the black sheep in the crowd. It is like something he's never done before, as all his films were supernatural in many ways.This is my favorite cartoon of all time, and one of the great motion pictures you're bound to ever come across in world cinema. Forget about Disney. If you love animation and film, go no further than Hayao Miyazaki, one of the last great directors and story tellers in a world which has forgotten quality. Disney died a long time ago, and Miyazaki is a director in the old tradition - a tradition where plot and characters meant much more than special effects. Porco Rosso is an escape you'll come back to often. Few films have captured the essence of Europe, Flying and Adventure quite like it. It lifts your spirits and inspires you to see the world in a different way. The beautiful mix of music, color, animation, detail and setting make this a most unforgettable experience. 'Porco Rosso' is the definitive work from the legend of modern animation, Hayao Miyazaki."
2,Porco Rosso,10,14 January 2003,It's a Miyazaki Ghibli... What else is there to say?,"If somebody were to start up an all-Ghibli network on television, I'd leave the set on that channel unless I heard a nuclear attack siren. Kurenai no Buta is one of those films that could fill up much of the schedule, as I could watch it over and over again.Set in Fascist Italy in the late twenties, the story is about a cursed WWI Italian fighter pilot, Porco Rosso, doomed to live out his life in the form of a pig.  He spends his leisure hours basking on his secluded private beach with his bright red monoplane. He makes his living by tangling with air pirates, collecting rewards for recovery of valuables.
Porco Rosso has a lot to deal with in this story. He has the pirates to contend with, a swashbuckling American mercenary looking for a good dogfight, an increasingly intrusive Fascist presence eyeing his activities, a finicky airplane, and two women in love with him. Other than the vaguely appearing Fascists, there are no real villains in the film.Mamma Aiuto is a heavy-set bearded chap, somewhat reminiscent of Bluto in the Popeye cartoons.  He and his gang of bungling pirates have honor, if not exactly fastidious bathing habits.Donald Curtis, an American mercenary, seems driven to glory and fame-and falls in love with every pretty face he sees.  He's after notoriety and feels an air duel with Porco Rosso is the ticket to get there.Gina, Porco's childhood sweetheart, runs a popular island resort.  She's still in love with him, but he doesn't quite get it.  All the pilots of the Adriatic love Gina, who was married and widowed thrice. Donald Curtis is right in there with everyone else vying for her attention.Fio Piccolo, a 17-year old American aeronautical engineer, is commissioned by a reluctant Porco to fix his plane.  She also falls in love with him as she gradually sees his character. He gets it, but he's not really interested in that kind of arrangement--especially with one so young.
A working, radio-controlled scale model of his plane hangs in the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Japan, along with photos of it in flight as proof that the airplane depicted in the film actually could fly. This story weaves together beautifully and leads to an ending that is a topic of discussion among those who have seen it.  This is a must-see film. I give it an easy 10."
3,Porco Rosso,10,12 October 2005,An underrated classic,"Although few people actually know about this film, it must be stated that this one of the best animated films of all time. It is also quite unique, and has comedy and themes more enjoyable for an adult audience, though youngsters should also get a kick out of it.Porco Rosso follows the adventures of a man known as porco, a pilot who attacks pirates for a fee during World War II, and has the unfortunate problem of being cursed to look like a pig. It follows his adventures, battling many different foes for a number of different reasons.Porco Rosso has a lot of things to recommend it. The artwork is stunning, with amazing attention to detail and a great anime style. The story is an absolute joy to follow, and has that perfect blend of comedy, drama and action. Although it is hard to describe the story properly without giving to much away, this truly is one to watch at all ages, though most of the humor is aimed at adults. Do yourself a favor and see it: you won't be disappointed."
4,Porco Rosso,10,29 April 2002,A shockingly perfect work of art,"Miyazaki is an inspiration for artists everywhere. His total mastery of all aspects of storytelling craft makes the amazing seem easy.Kurenai no Buta manages to be over-the-top fun and exceedingly subtle at the same moment.  The dialogue is at once straightforward yet with layer upon layer of dramatic meaning.  The animated wizardry is stunning as usual, yet never over the top. It always comes across as so natural.This film is a homage to so many different genres, places, people and attitudes one could go on ages pulling them all out.  Amazing amount of detail packed into every scene.Well I am running out of superlatives.  Like all master works of art, this leaves you with something special.  In this case I find it hard to describe perhaps since the Pig himself is such a mysterious character.
See it."
5,Porco Rosso,10,7 May 2005,"Well, it's Miyazaki. What'd you expect?","""Porco Rosso"" is probably the first animated Humphrey Bogart film. Why? The title character, a WWI flying ace who has been transformed into a pig, reminded me of Bogart with his gruff manner and that world-weary cynicism that instantly endears us to Bogart. ""Porco Rosso"" is also a highly entertaining adventure film, and Miyazaki has once again created a slew of characters you can either cheer for or hiss vehemently at them.The US dub is done particularly well (Disney tends not to muck Miyazaki's movies up most of the time), with Michael Keaton hitting that Bogart vibe as the title character. Keaton was obviously the first choice on the dubber's mind for this character, and he performs excellently. Susan Egan is the voice of Madame Gina, Porco's friend who loves him but he doesn't quite get it. Cary Elwes, who is of course British, does a convincing Southern accent as the movie's main villain, Curtis, a hotshot American pilot who challenges Porco. David Ogden Stiers shows off his vocal chameleon skills as Piccolo, Porco's mechanic friend; Stiers's voice sounds genuinely Italian, and I must again wonder: How does he do it? Anyway, moving on. Kimberly Williams, whom you may or may not remember from the Steve Martin version of ""Father of the Bride"", is spunky as Fio, the other main female character who becomes Porco's partner (albeit reluctantly on his part).All in all, ""Porco Rosso"" is a highly entertaining movie, and it should be seen by everyone."
6,Porco Rosso,10,8 July 2005,"Great story, wonderful characters, fantastic animation","First of all, I've never seen the title ""Kurenai no buta"" except on IMDb. The English title on my copy and all other references I've found on the web are ""Porco Rosso"". Outside Japan, that's the title to look for at the video store. Let's see what we've got: an Italian Pig speaking Japanese, ""Knock your socks off"" aerial vistas, not one but two beautiful heroines, an Adriatic hotel that's actually a small island, better dialog than many ""live"" movies, sky pirates, even good music. How many films can claim all that? Perhaps the most attractive character of the film, after you've gotten past the many obvious ones, is Myazaki's amazing imagination which pervades all aspects of the production.To me, the storyline is reminiscent of Hollywood's Golden Age. The characters are wonderful, even to an adult audience and, of course, high quality animation is the frosting on the cake.After seeing Porco Rosso, I bought the DVD, and I hardly ever do that!"
7,Porco Rosso,,9 October 2002,Exupery,"This was truly an emotional and unexpected experience. Having known Miyazaki has been influenced by Exupery(author of the little prince)I watched this film with a lump in my throat. A story of a PIG no less destined to live out his days in the sky, where his heart IS purified by the heavens above and the sea below. A beautiful film a love poem to Exupery and all the brave fliers who've come and gone."
8,Porco Rosso,,28 February 2011,When Pigs Fly,"Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few Japanese animators to be fully embraced by mainstream Western audiences, perhaps because he is a giant europhile, thoroughly fond of European culture, architecture, art and food.No surprise then that ""Porco Rosso"" is heavily influenced by 1930-40s British, American and French adventure comics (""Popular Flying"", ""Battlefield Action"", ""Frontline Combat"" etc), all of which served up exciting tales set in Europe, often with soldiers as heroes. A large subset of these comics focused solely on fighter pilots (The Red Baron, James Bigglesworth, The White Fokker), romanticised knights of the skies, gallant, brave and chivalrous. As the war drew to a close, and film noirs became popular, the prim and proper aviation hero got a little bit scuffed up. He was now not only a total ace, but a suave ladies man, moody loner and cynic.And so ""Porco Rosso"" takes the best from these early wartime adventures and collides them with Humprey Bogart noirs, Michael Curtiz flicks, Pressburger's ""A Matter of Life and Death"" and Miyazaki's own obsessions, all to create a kind of ultra romantic cocktail. The setting: a fantastical version of 1920's Italy, in which the skies are ruled by heroic seaplane pilots, bounty-hunters and pirates. When they're not dodging tracers and dancing in the skies, these hotshot fly boys hang out at Gina's island café, where they kick back, relax and listen to Gina sing sad tunes of lovers long lost. Here, like Rick's Bar in ""Casablanca"", there's an unwritten truce between all men. You may be enemies in the clouds, but on Gina's island, everyone's your buddy.The film revolves around Porco Rosso (Italian for ""the crimson pig""), a chubby pig dressed in a detective's trench coat and dark shades. He should be ridiculous, but with his witty one-liners (""I'd rather be a pig than a fascist""), cool detachment, political apathy and romantic distance, comes across instead as Bogart with a snout. The guy's not just the coolest pilot in the Adriatic, but a total ladies man, women fawning over him despite his perpetual disinterest.Like most of Miyazaki's films, the plot is barely told. What Miyazaki invests in is creating worlds. Moody spaces. And so we savour the film's postcard images of Croatian and Italian villages, its lovingly drawn architecture, Gina's cosy island château (seemingly modelled on Rick's Bar in ""Casablanca""), gorgeous Adriatic inlets and coastlines, beautiful landscape shots, interesting machinery and Miyazaki's large cast of good natured friends and foes. Throw in master composer Joe Hisaishi's gorgeous score  romantic, easygoing, suggestive of the French Rivierra - and this film kills you with aesthetics.All of Miyazaki's other obsessions are here  flying, European/Mediterreanean towns, an aesthetic which suggests a fusion of time periods, little girls, air-planes, airships, Ozu-like still-life tableaux  except environmentalist preaching. The absence of this sermonising makes ""Porcco Rosso"", like ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", one of his most laid-back films. It's less about plot than it's about ambiance and environment. What little plot there is, is itself all suggestive; suggested romances, suggested pasts, suggested futures.The film is packed with great scenes, some of them resembling Carroll Ballard's ""Wind"", released the same year (one film revolves around building a boat, the other a plane). Beyond the film's dog fights and aerial battles you have Gina's wistful, aching love for Porcco, whom she affectionately calls by his human name, Marco (Gina's love, made wise by age, is mirrored to the young puppy love of a 17 year old girl). It's a weird interspecies love affair, peppered with flashbacks reminiscent of Leone's ""A Fistfull of Dynamite"".The film's ""beauty and the beast"" romance has led to much speculation as to why exactly Porcco is a pig. The film seems to say that Marco put a spell on himself: he views himself as a pig, as being unworthy of living, and it is only gradually, through the validation of others, that he comes to realise that he's not all that bad.In terms of the flaws, the film's villains are too idiotic. They're bumbling buffoons and their juvenility at times takes you out of the story. Incidentally, many fans of the film wage fierce battles over which of the film's dub tracks is better. Purists prefer the Japanese track, a few like the American track and many prefer the French. The French version, in which Jean Reno plays Porcco, is far better than the Japanese dub, and even Miyazaki thinks so himself. Personally, though, I think ""Porcco Rosso"" is the only Miyazaki film in which the American (or Disney) dubbing is much better than the original Japanese voice acting. Here, actor Michael Keaton plays Porcco, mixing a little Bat Man, pig and Bogart to great effect. Actress Susan Egan is also suitably classy as Gina.10/10  For an alternate take on similar material, see Mamoru Oshii's underrated ""The Sky Crawlers""."
9,Porco Rosso,10,10 April 2004,One of the greatest animated film,"Kurenai no Buta is, as anything else created by Hazao Miyazaki, a sublime work of art. However this film is very different from the rest of Miyazaki's work, as it aims at a grown-up and mature audience. The story is a metaphorical tale about the true nature of man and humanity. Set within the historical background of the rise of fascism in Italy, it is one of the most cleverly written animated film I've ever seen. As usual Miyazaki's boundless imagination brings on screen some colourful characters you're not likely to forget, among which a bunch of maverick but good hearted air pirates (very much like in Castle in th Sky). It also introduces more complicated characters, with real depth, like Porco or Madame Gina. The film also contains some amazingly beautiful and graphic sequences, with detailed landscapes seen from the sky and plane chase over the sea. This film gives a true meaning to Animated Film. It is without question a Must see."
10,Porco Rosso,,29 April 2010,"Space, Water","The things this filmmaker drops on the path, charm in their strangeness and that is good enough for me.I originally thought to write about the role of certain filmmakers in their films: how you can see over a number of films their foibles and fears, their attempts at self-analysis and completion. It is one of those many things about cinema that is interesting to a viewer, but it is not quite good enough material for a comment associated with a film. Even with Fellini we aren't interested in how his films transformed him as a soul, only how they transform us. IMDb needs a way to comment on or even write essays about a filmmaker. So instead I will write about something that factors into our story-of-watching as well as the filmmaker's.Stories carry us forward. They carry us because they entice with the impossibilities of what happens next which could be anything, combined with the conflicting certainty of the equally powerful urge that it will ""end well."" Any storyteller will eventually tell you about himself and the story he makes for himself. If he lives in cinema, well then he will literally live in cinema, thinking of himself in cinematic terms.I like Miyazaki. I like the imagination behind the images better than I am drawn to the skill and richness of their execution. You live their lives.Here we have some powerful fantasies: a redheaded intelligent younger woman that is smitten with him. An older woman, wise in the ways of the world patiently waiting for him to discover the possibilities. Self-loathing over missed opportunities. A love of living in dimension, mastering height in a visual way, seeing everyone before they see you. What a guy. The one movie is enough for you to like him. The genre urge pulls.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
11,Porco Rosso,6,3 June 2009,When pigs fly,"I guess I have come to expect greatness from every film Miyazaki does. The animation is great but the story is so-so and this might be the worst voice acting for one of his films. I didn't get enough explanation for why the main character changed into a pig. There is a great moment when he tells the story of the day he became a pig, but no explanation. It starts to head that way but then stops. The ending is also a bit of a letdown with no resolution. I don't think my demands were that harsh. There is also too much emphasis on women's rights. Yes it takes place during the 20s, but come on, let's get on with the story."
12,Porco Rosso,10,19 May 2006,One of the best!!,"There is not a great deal that I could add to what has been said about this movie. I was bowled over by it, as was my wife.As has been said before, it is not like any other animated feature that I have seen. I kept wondering who would play the leading role if this were a live movie. Porco (or Marco) is a great swashbuckling romantic hero. Perhaps the Humphrey Bogart of Casablance would be similar.I saw this in Japanese, not in English, and I think that might be the best way. The male characters use the sort of voice tone and inflection that I associate with samurai movies -- a loud and very gruff tone. That seemed to fit the movie very well. I can't imagine English language actors doing the same.I have now seen a number of Miyazawa's films, and am amazed each time."
13,Porco Rosso,10,17 January 2006,Miyazaki soars through the skies,Porco Rosso is a truly touching film with an absolutely amazing musical score. The closing credits song is to me one of Studio Ghibli's Finest Moments. I Liked the expressions used and Miyazaki has not skimped on detail.Anime Movies are the greatest animations because their is expressive detail and personalities shown with detail and movements.Porco Rosso has touched many with this epic that has an amazing storyline which starts from just a simple idea that really touches your heart.The Characters are sublime and they are true to their characteristics.My Favourite scenes have to be:1. The Closing Credits -(Truly touching). 2. All the women fixing the seaplane - (shows how feminism is truly important to Miyazaki). 3.The Final Sentences from Fio - (She says just enough to show you what the ending will just be).Studio Ghibli has been successful once again and there is a very bright future up ahead from Anime.
14,Porco Rosso,7,18 August 2011,Fascinating  and haunting adventure set in  Italy   of the 20s by the great Hayao Miyazaki,"Riveting and marvelous film by the genius cartoonist Hayao Miyazaki .This magnificent cartoon movie concerns about Porco Rosso legend, the adventures of a 1920's bush pilot in Italy , specifically on Adriatic sea , an era during Mussolini government , ruling the fascism , with air pirates, and high fliers of all sorts dominate the skies . It begins when who just happens to look like a humanoid pig , Porco Rosso , a previous Air Ace, he today is a bounty hunter and does a living flying contract jobs, such as rescuing those abducted little girls by air pirates. As hero Porco goes after the pirates, severely damaging their aircraft. Later on , Porco goes to the Hotel Adriano, where he deals with Gina, an old girlfriend who owns the wonderful resort on an island . Donald Curtis, Porco's contender in the air and in catching the affections of Gina , provides a constant challenge to the valiant Porco . Both of then will confront on the air taking place overwhelming chases , pursuits and dogfighting on the skies . This wonderful film is plenty of fantasy , adventures, spectacular dogfighting and with agreeable message. The picture is narrated with sensibility and sense of wonder and is quite entertaining , as is apt for small kids but no contains graphic violence such as ¨Monokome-Hime¨ . The film packs lively situations , hilarious scenes , spectacular images and culminating in an air confrontation with breathtaking ending . All roles have multiple dimensions and display really astonishing humanity . The drawings have a special ancient touch that conveys the forgotten wisdom of the past that could really affect the way you interact with others and with the ambient . This stunning film with appropriate runtime , converted the first of any kind to gross over the box office in Japan and around the world. The motion picture is splendidly realized by Hayao Miyazaki and accompanied by sensible music score composed by his usual musician, Joe Hisaishi. Miyazaki also directed other excellent cartoon movies as ¨Howl's moving castle, Chihiro, Nicky , Nausica of the valley of the wind , My neighbor Tororo¨ and many others . Sensational and fantastic tale, it's a masterpiece cartoon movie , a great animation with an enjoyable meaning . One of a kind, if you enjoy interesting stories and have a soft spot for deep characters and well planed scenarios, you are in for a great one. Rating : Better that average , worthwhile watching ; advisable to see for children and adults who appeal the gorgeous drawings ."
15,Porco Rosso,5,23 October 2005,Doesn't fly quite high enough,"I confess to having been a bit let down by Porco Rosso. Perhaps I've been spoiled by the epic grandeur of Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke (or by the dreamlike wonder of Spirited Away), but this one seemed rather mundane at best, not to mention annoyingly incomplete.As many here have already noted, the film revolves around Porco's love life -- or lack thereof. Though he blusters about being a ""notorious womanizer,"" he lives alone on a desert island, seems remarkably uncomfortable in the presence of women, and keeps the two outstanding beauties who love him at arm's length with droll, self-deprecating tough-guy sarcasm and feeble excuses. By the time we reach the end, all that relentlessly fatalistic wisecracking begins to feel uncomfortably close to a subtle form of whining, tending to make Porco less sympathetic than he might otherwise be.Given this focus on Porco's unfulfilling romances, some sort of logical closure on the subject is surely called for. Yet the most we ever get -- or do we? -- is a possible, minuscule, indication in the final scene that might or might not indicate that he ultimately returns to Gina. (Though personally, I find the spunky go-getter Fio a far more engaging heroine than the cool but essentially passive Gina). A bit of a fizzle after all the attention given to the subject during the story's unwinding.How did Porco acquire his curse in the first place? Welldon't ask, because you won't be answered. And though the story appears to take place sometime in the mid-Thirties, we're told that by the ending credits several wars have passed, and jets are flying over Porco's Mediterranean, yet an apparently recent movie poster of a seemingly un-aged Curtis in Forties style decorates a wall.Though we're supposed to think of Porco Rosso as being somehow more ""adult"" than Myazaki's other films, the nonthreatening Popeye-style villains keep dragging us back to the grade-school level, robbing the story of any real suspense. Too many unanswered questions; too little genuine conflict. Even the Master's artistry and imagination can't cover so many holes.On the plus side, Michael Keaton's dub as Porco is absolutely wonderful, possibly the best voice-over job I've ever heard. In fact, the entire voice cast delivers a collectively flawless performance. And, this being a Miyazaki film, the animation is, of course, superb. For those reasons alone, I'd classify Porco Rosso as a must-see -- but only once; repeated viewings only make the shortcomings of its script all the more glaring. It's a daring concept, but much as it pains me to say so, Porco Rosso promises far more than it can deliver."
16,Porco Rosso,,2 September 2006,An engaging and entertaining animation,"It is a time in the Mediterranean when sea planes still rule the skies and large areas are controlled by sky pirates, who run raids and kidnapping on passing ships. The only saving grace of the area is bounty hunter Porco Rosso (or The Crimson Pig) who is famed for his speed and skill. Suffering under a curse that turned him from a man into a pig, Rosso is the scourge of the pirates until they hire the services of American Curtis, award winning race pilot. Their first skirmish sees Rosso defeated and feared dead but, while Curtis gloats over his victory, Rosso returns to Italy where his favourite mechanic lives despite the outstanding arrest warrants for him in that country.Thanks to FilmFour becoming the first free-to-air film channel in the UK I was treated to a week of Miyazaki films, most of which I hadn't seen before. Kurenai no buta was the first one I watched because it looked like it would be the most fun. The story is an enjoyable tale of a dog fighting pig that works well as an adventure while also having enough invention and character to make it more than just a lot of noise and colour for kids. The adventure aspect is good though and has plenty of classy (ie not just silly and exaggerated) action and children should be easily distracted. Although not that deep, the film does have solid characters that have layers and humour. Rosso is a simple character perhaps but at least he is interesting and less obvious than most animated film leads. This made the film more engaging for me and meant that the film never dropped when the action was put on the backburner  in fact the strongest moments are humour and character based. Miyazaki directs with a great eye and unique style. The film is consistently visually impressive and, although the setting limits the imagination, it is still very much what it is.The English dub cast do a good job and, for all the criticisms of Disney in their handling of these films, credit to them for doing this right. Keaton makes for a good Rosso, playing him gruff and seemingly uncaring which was the right direction to go. Characters like this don't really ever crack and so Keaton does well to hold back while only hinting at the humanity within his character. Elwes is nicely cheesy as Curtis and works well. Williams is really fun as Fio and she provided a lot of energy once she joined in, certainly she was better than Egan who I found rather dull and unable to do much with her character. An unrecognisable Stiers makes for some nice comedy as master engineer Piccolo.Overall this was an enjoyable film. Perhaps not enough emotional depth to it to make it stand with Miyazaki's finest work but still a very engaging and entertaining family film with more than enough for children and a solid narrative and character foundation that will make it easy for adults to care about."
17,Porco Rosso,10,26 May 2006,Porco Rosso is Fantabulous ...,"In my opinion the Disney ""Porco Rosso"" version with Michael Keaton is one of the finest films ever created. By the way, I love Jean Reno and I would imagine that the French version is probably just as well done. I would even imagine that the original Japanese version is also a masterpiece.What's really important is not the language, but that this is a magnificent work of art. The story and the graphics are extraordinary! This is a timeless film. This is a classic! This film deserves to be in the top ten movies of all time. Fortunately, I am not alone in my praise of Porco Rosso. Respected critics from all over the world are loudly singing its praises.This is not just animation. This is not just anime. This is the fabulous result of an incredible imagination coupled with the mind of a creative genius! My advice ... Don't miss it !!!"
18,Porco Rosso,7,21 May 2015,This movie will make you believe that pigs could indeed fly.,"This was indeed a beautiful film from Studio Ghibli. It had some really, nearly perfect visuals, some funny humor, and interesting concept, but there was a little something missing, preventing it from being one of my favorites, Hayao Miyazaki's films. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, but I think this movie got under the hype that every Hayao Miyazaki film is supposed to be judge as good, just because fans love 1988's My Neighbor Totoro, so much. In my opinion, this movie is kinda overrated. Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film was originally planned as a short in-flight film for Japan Airlines based on Miyazaki's manga, 'The Age of the Flying Boat', but grew into a feature-length film. The movie doesn't really have much of a plot and because of that, the story kinda crash and burns. The plot somewhat revolves around an Italian curse World War I ex-fighter ace, Marco Rousolini AKA Porco Rosso (voiced by Shûichirô Moriyama in Japanese/ Michael Keaton in English) whom became half-man, half-pig after his compatriots were killed in battle. He is now a jaded womanizing bounty hunter rescuing ships and babies from the attacks of bumbling pirates across the Adriatic Sea. While, this sum-up sounds entertaining, in truth, the movie, sadly, has very little flying in it. It only has one-major action set piece in the film. The movie depicts most of airplane battles as childish and silly. Lots of bullets are fired, but nobody dies in this PG movie. Even airplane dog-fight, packed with innocent spectators on the ground, doesn't have one victim. Tons of property damage ensues, but somehow the stray gunfire only hits inanimate objects! Come on- movie. Take more a risk. Sadly, the movie never truly, goes anywhere, intense with its action. The odd collection of air pirates are more rivals than villains, and their screwball antics are played for comedy. Most of the film, has Porco repairing his ship with a female mechanic, Flo Piccolo (Voiced by Akemi Okamura in Japanese/ Kimberly Williams-Paisley in English), after being shot down by Donald Curtis (Voiced by Akio Ōtsuka in Japanese/ Cary Elwes in English), a cocky American fighter pilot who joins forces with the pirates. He hopes to get payback against Curtis, but the movie ignored that, for most of the film, to push the romantic overtures of both Flo & the cocktail singer Gina (Voiced by Tokiko Kato in Japanese/ Susan Egan in English) on him. We get it, Porco must learn to be least misogyny towards women. In other words, try not to be a pig. One of the film's biggest problems, is the lack of emotional connection. Honestly, all of Porco's relationships, don't seem real. It all seem a bit forced and kinda bland. Most people will say the picture's best emotional scene is Porco's backstory of what happened to him in the war. I have to agree, it was amazing. It is taken from a scene from Roald Dahl short story called They Shall Not Grow Old. Originally there are more be explained, but most of the serious tone of WW1 had to scrap off the storyboard because of the Yugoslavian wars of the early 1990s, due to it, being set in Croatia. Another great scene is Porco watching a cartoon in a darken movie theater. The cartoon depicts a Mickey Mouse Expy striving to save his girlfriend from a villainous pig in an airplane. The obvious metaphor is clear. It's a great moment in the film as we see the ""pig"" as a symbol of a man's alienation, loathing and despair. If you look deep in the film, you might find themes of redemption, loss and love to be very powerful in this, underneath the more fun surface. Sadly, it's not easy to find. The English voice acting is alright for the most part. Michael Keaton does a good job as Porco. He show the cynical side, very well. Still, I kinda like Jean Reno's French dubbing, more, as it was a little well-rounded performance. British actor, Cary Elwes as American, Curtis was mediocre, at best. The Southern accent was bit odd. It's goes in and out, throughout the film. It was really over-the-top Errol Flynnism. Not his best work, but it was watchable. The music to the film was amazing. Another masterpiece from composer Joe Hisaishi. The animation was OK, for the time. Hand by hand, drawings, is hard to do, and I just glad, everything, more so fluently. The only problem that I notice is that Flo looks very similar to Nausicaa from 1984's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, another Ghibli movie; Miyazaki has a tendency to recycle character models, and it shows here. I like how much the movie is a homage to early aviation. You really can tell that they did, their research. The movie was very accurate with the planes designs. However, there were some exaggerated. The end of the film was particularly unimpressive. I really hate that, it ends abruptly and didn't resolve, anything. Miyazaki has expressed interest in making a sequel. He plans to set it in the Spanish Civil War, calling the film's working title, Porco Rosso: The Last Sortie. As of this writing, the movie hasn't been made, or look like it ever will be, made. Still, the movie did influence, other works. One good example is Disney's Tale-Spin, TV show. Overall: This movie is too silly to be taken seriously. Honestly, this movie could have been amazing. It could had been, probably one of Miyazaki's best works, but with glaring plot holes, frustrating romances, and indecisive writing. It's not. Still, it's a warm, nostalgic fun film, even if it doesn't quite fly high enough."
19,Porco Rosso,10,29 December 2014,"Deliberate unevenness, reflections of self and story","I had been putting off watching Porco Rosso for quite some time. It wasn't so much that I was anticipating not liking it. Rather, it was more a trepidation that while good, Porco Rosso wouldn't quite measure up to the other Miyazaki films which I've loved.I should have known better.The simplicity of the cover, and the description of the plot that I had in my mind were so much less than what Porco Rosso contains. The marketing, advertising, and so forth, place emphasis on the struggle between Porco and the pirates of the Adriatic. The second point of plot typically mentioned is the ""curse"" that he has fallen under. In truth, neither of these things form the real backbone of the story: psychology is at the heart of this narrative.A film simply about a bounty hunter versus pirates could be a fine ride, if executed in a way which stirs. However, without the kind of psychological backdrop that we get in Porco's character, it wouldn't be possible to really move the audience. What raises this story from simply engaging to stirring, moving, is our main characters' relationship to their individual and shared pasts. In a really clever way, the film introduces this haunting aspect of the past not through the main character, but through the character of Gina. Of a similar generation, Gina introduces this idea during her first conversation with Porco, where she receives news that her husband has been confirmed dead, she seems unusually unemotional. As she expresses to Porco, she has shed so many tears already, that she finds she has no more left to give. The carnage of world war 1 and the vagaries of life in a world where fate can snatch love from us has left her emotionally drained.Where Gina is melancholy and stoic, Porco broods and isolates. As the sole survivor of a battle where Gina's first husband died, he feels personally responsible. This sort of survivor's guilt is reflected with his constant self-deprecation; constantly we see signs of him expressing a low sense of self-worth. He doesn't deny his skill as a pilot, but what he does deny is that he is in any way a ""good guy."" When Gina tells him that her husband didn't make it home alive, he responds ""the good guys never do,"" making explicit this contrast between himself and a good guy.His profession as a mercenary is almost ideal for his state. It allows him to pretend that he's only in it for the money, while at the same time he has put himself in a position to do good works: saving children, defending the monied defenseless, etc. He does have a sense of morality, of course. We see this in his careful targeting of his opponents planes: he always aims to cripple and shoot down, never to kill the opposing pilot. It is difficult for him to see the evidence that we see, however. We understand the regret he feels as a sign of his ethical standards; he dismisses it out of hand. One imagines that, for him, that is a bare-minimum, rather than a characteristic that one can be proud of.The devices that film uses to achieve the character development of Porco can, at times, be a bit trite. The character of Fio is perhaps a bit too on-the-nose as the young idealist who, unshackled by a painful past, is able to help shake off some of the emotional armor that Porco has surrounded himself in. However, Miyazaki saves the character by simply writing her as an intelligent, brave, young woman whom the audience can both respect and relate to. Even more intelligently, although Fio develops an admiration for and a crush on Porco, this thread isn't really developed. As a character, Fio wouldn't really work as Porco's love interest. It would add on the additional cliché of older-man younger-woman and that would just take Miyazaki's use of common story devices too far.Gina is the more realistic love interest for Porco, and just as a sense of feminism imbues the character of Fio, so too does a sense of feminism shape Gina. Far from the virgin-whore duality that infects so many female characters, Gina is fully realized as a woman with hopes and desires, losses and memories, that make her an equal of Porco. She has been married, and she has known love, but this doesn't ""spoil"" her. Rather, it has matured her.Even more impressively, the relationship between Gino and Porco is based on friendship, a friendship which goes back to happier times. How refreshing to see romance kindled in such a realistic way, as compared to the constant barrage of films where characters either fall in love with each other for narrative convenience.As good as this movie is, I suspect that its greatest impact can be felt on those who are struggling with the emotions of Gina and Porco. To struggle with one's past is no uncommon thing, and those who are working to set aside feelings of loss and self-loathing will probably find the greatest amount of catharsis as Porco slowly comes to realize that he doesn't need to define himself as a pig any longer. Certainly, only those who have run out of tears will be able to fully appreciate the emotional desolation the Gina describes."
20,Porco Rosso,10,4 March 2013,Takes you masterfully back to a never existent time,"First of all, I want to clarify some misconceptions about the film that might have appeared in the comment section. First of all, the movie plays in the time frame after the rise of Fascism in Italy from 1922 on to before the second world war. There is a flashback scene playing in the World War I. In the end, there is a time lapse and they mention World War II.Secondly, the film is not a story about how a man got jinxed to be a pig. Marco having the appearance of a pig can be interpreted in different ways and is often used in word plays and ironic statements, like ""better to be a pig than to be a Fascist"". The reason why it was never explained is probably that it would be totally unnecessary or even harm the story, including the grand finale. It is the great strength of this movie that it does not want to cover all the stories details, but leaves in a very poetic way so much room for speculation and dreaming.The drawings are just beautiful in all of their details and animation and the music by the ever ingenious Joe Hisaishi surprises. While Hisaishi does take notes from European classical music, it is surprising how he managed to fusion his particular style of music with the nostalgia of the twenties and Italian and Austrian (or rather Dalmatian) influences. This movie is an absolute masterpiece in story telling, animation and music and is greatly underestimated. While other works of Ghibli might be cineastically great, they serve completely different audiences. What makes Porco Rosso so outstanding is that it realistically gives us viewers strong emotions about bygone days that actually never existed in the way they had been depicted and thus sends a strong message to everyone about things we might want to preserve, ideas of freedom,solitude, guilt, adventure and love that do actually exist."
21,Porco Rosso,8,24 December 2011,The first Studio Ghibli film I ever saw & it's a goodie!!!...,"I believe this was the first Studio Ghibli film I ever saw. I remember being blown away by the excellent story telling, the animation and the general feeling of the whole thing. From then on I was hooked and made it a bit of a mission to see as many of them as I could. Well, that's not hard when Film4 (here in the UK) has been showing a season of them for the last couple of weeks. I'll give you my thoughts on this particular offering after this brief summary.Porco Rosso is a pilot; a bit of a hero from World War I who now makes a living as a bounty hunter. He tracks down the sea plane pirates who attack the ships on the Adriatic Coast (a part of the Mediterranean). It is the 1920's and flying is what everyone wants to do. At a bar run by Gina, who secretly loves him, Porco meets an American fighter ace, Curtis, who has been hired by the pirates to take him out. But Porco has problems with his plane and has to take it to Milan to be repaired. Curtis follows him and shoots him down, leaving him stranded. When he's picked up he makes it to Milan with what's left of his plane and has it rebuilt by Fio Pikkoro, a seventeen year old girl who just happens to be a very talented engineer. When he returns, Fio comes with him to make sure he pays his bill. Little does she know they're about to have another run-in with the pirates and this time they're playing for keeps! I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (Animation Division) will have me re-drawn as some crazy animal (again).Over the years I have become a bit of a fan of the work of Hayao Miyazaki, he certainly knows how to make a movie that can take you away to another world for a couple of hours. Again, this one is beautifully animated and I also loved the music by Joe Hisaishi, it really evokes the era and stirs the emotions. I watched this one in Japanese with subtitles and I think that helps you to concentrate on the story. For those who fear the subtitle I believe a dubbed version is available. It's not really clear just who played who from the listings I've seen, but I will give honourable mentions to the voice talents of; Shûichirô Moriyama, Tokiko Katô, Tsunehiko Kamijô and Akemi Okamura.I found this film beautifully made, funny at times, but also very touching when it needed to be. It certainly did what many of the Studio Ghibli films have done and that is entertain me! I must admit I feel lucky that I saw this one first; others that don't quite hit the mark may have put me off. So it's got a bit of everything, a flying pig, some comedy, a bit of a love story and pirates, who could ask for more!? As you have probably guessed by now, for me Definitely recommended.My score: 8.4/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 16,525 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 100/100 (based on 13 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 60/100 (based on 40,738 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."
22,Porco Rosso,10,30 April 2003,uh....wow,"while I like Spirited Away and have no clue how come that movie with so many unfamiliarity with audience can win oscar, this one is a shock to the system. I can't really say which is better, but this animated feature has the most smile evoking soundtrack ever. They fit perfectly to the scenes as well and guess what? there're really no bad guys here. A movie (not anime) with innocence taste if anything can be critized at all, I would reluctantly pick on the smoking..tee hee....although the action itself is not implied at alla real gem"
23,Porco Rosso,5,6 November 2008,"The Higher you fly, the longer the fall","I love Miyazaki movies. From the first movie i saw of his, spirited away, to the latest before this one, castle of cagliostro, i've loved them all. They all have an air about them that leaves you breathless and puts you in a great mood if you're feeling down never disappointing the audience... until this one.Now don't get me wrong. i didn't HATE this movie, but at the same time, it was not nearly his best. It still captures the spirit and life of a Miyazaki movie, but at the same time, has so many plot holes and frustrating things that you are taken out of the story and left complaining. and Miyazaki should NEVER do that.I found several problems with this movie. 1. They don't ever explain why he's a pig. now, forgive me if i sound a bit prudish but um.. he's a pig. and no one questions it? Does that happen often or something in that world? I'm not confused by the fact that he IS a pig, i'd just like to know WHY he's a pig, and WHY nobody asks him about it. Halfway through the movie when Fio asks him to tell him a story i figure he was going to tell her why he's a pig, but then he goes into a weird heaven story and you never find out. that frustrated me, and there was no reason why they couldn't have spent 45 seconds telling us why. it's like in howl's moving castle if they started the movie with sophie already old and not telling us why. it was stupid and they could have rectified it easily2. it couldn't decide what age range it was. normally, in a film if you can't tell what age range it's meant for, that's the sign of a good movie, bringing in both the kids and the older demographic. but in this film it was just frustrating. one scene it would be full of laughs and for kids, the next it would be about death and going to heaven. it didn't flow seamlessly like Miyazaki does in his other films such as Castle in the sky. you know it's adult, but at the same time, keeps yo+u happy. Porco just had odd juxtapositions that just don't make a whole lot of sense. the switches needed to flow better.3. The love interest. OK. this is one i didn't understand AT ALL. Gina, the main love interest is about as interesting as a sack of wet leaves. She's boring, has no personality or anything likable about her, and she hardly does ANYTHING throughout the entire film. On the other hand, the girl Fio travels with Porco for the entire movie. Saving his life, placing herself up to wager for Porco's honor, and eventually freeing him from the curse. and yet, Porco ends up with miss wet leaves? that's just stupid. they spend so much time building the relationship between porco and fio and then dismissing it at the end? wow that's terrible. i'm not one to normally complain about there being a lack of love in movies but my god was the love resolution done terribly in this movie.4. The ending. for the resolution of this film, we get stock footage of a cloud and a narration by fio. Telling us basically nothing. She becomes the owner of the garage, the American is a star, and porco (mumbles off) oh. thanks. yeah. god forbid we actually want to KNOW what happened at the end. This ending was tacked on, lazy, and the cheapest thing ever. it's like the ending to Fable (the game). you stick with it to the end and you expect a big payoff and get slapped in the face. it was rushed and felt cheap. Miyazaki never does that, and i was very surprised and disappointed he did it here.The voice acting, animation, and music are once again superb, but it got more than a little messed up in the script department. If you need to see this to finish off your Miyazaki collection, i'd say save this one for later rather than watch it now. and if you're trying to get someone into him, don't start off with this one. i recommend Kiki's delivery service, or for the adventure fans, Castle in the Sky. The plot premise really was a very good one. It just needed a bit of tweaking and a few rewrites, and it would have been amazing, probably one of his best. But with glaring plot holes, frustrating romances, and indecisive writing, Porco Rosso gets 5 aerial maneuvers, out of 10."
24,Porco Rosso,7,20 January 2006,"Great animation, weird story, kinda boring","OK, I came with great expectations, as I am tracking these anime movies from the latest to the earliest. It is only normal that the old ones be less interesting and emotional relatively. However, also in comparison to other films by the same author, I found this less emotional and less believable, so it did not reach either the intellect or my heart.As a story, it's original, alright, the world of aviators in the Adriatic sea, somewhere in the 1920s. The main character is a pig, no one really know why he looks like that. Sometimes people seem to see the human face, as well, but only as a glimpse.The end is what ruins most of it. You expect some kind of conclusion, but none comes. You get that 'pilot' feeling (pun intended :)) ) when a lot of things are left unexplained for the series to complete the picture (I am full of puns, am I not?).Conclusion, good, but not amongst the best."
25,Porco Rosso,5,17 November 2006,Disappointing...,"This is the first time I can say that I have been disappointed by one of Miyazaki's films, but I really don't think that this film is special at all. It ticks all the usual boxes (looks pretty, fantasy story, young girl, happy ending) but it all just feels a bit perfunctory, and it lacks the magic or imagination of his better works.Right from the start I was not enchanted, and I think the weirdness of the central conceit is responsible  everything is reasonably realistic and plausible and recognisable and the central character isa pig?!?! It just makes no sense  the matter of fact way that this walking, talking pig strolls around an otherwise non-fantastical world is too jarring to engage the audience. Or at least that's what I thought  maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, it's a shame as I've enjoyed every other Miyazaki I've seen, but this was a bum chord."
26,Porco Rosso,9,8 November 1999,Miyazaki is God,"When I sat down to watch this, I had just seen Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa in the same day, and harbored doubts as to whether Miyazaki could do an all-out comedy. As it turned out, he is as unnervingly brilliant at evoking laughs as he is at fantasy.  This is a rare animated film that works on every conceivable level, almost BECAUSE there's no compelling reason for it to be animated.  Aside from the hero's identity as a pig (which is never fully explained, mind you), everything here is pretty much real-world (or the screwball comedy version of real world).  The level of detail is, as expected, mind-boggling, and the flight models of the maneuvering planes are gorgeous. Fans of animation, aviation, comedy, or pretty much anything else should look into this."
27,Porco Rosso,10,21 February 1999,Visual magic...another Miyazaki masterpiece.,"Hayao Miyazaki really put his heart and soul into this film...and it shows. Porco Rosso is simply one of the most...perfect movies I have seen.  Imbued with Miyazaki's light-hearted sense of humor, yet set in the very real danger of pre-WW2 Fascist Italy, this is one animation that desperately needs to see the light of day in America.  The aerial scenes are some of the best I've ever seen - the art style is lush and poetic (the Adriatic never looked better on the screen) and the characters are appealing... and very human, all with their faults and virtues.  Porco is best of all...with his world-weary personality, and his penchant for wine and women, he seems an unlikely hero...if he weren't so truly noble inside.  Here's hoping Disney does this film the justice it deserves!"
28,Porco Rosso,7,11 February 2008,"Flashes of brilliance, quirky, interesting and never less than entertaining","This is the first Hayao Miyazaki movie I've seen and it has that quantum difference of artistic quality which seems to distinguish Japanese animation from the rest - quality above and beyond commercial demands. It is very quirky being by turns sophisticated and in other parts well, simply cartoon-like (the pirates are all it seems versions of Popeye's arch-enemy Bluto). The central character Porco watches early cartoons of aeroplanes in a cinema so one guesses from this and other things that the great animator is paying homage to his animation predecessors. The setting is Fascist Italy in the 1930's. Miyazaki shows a great eye for authentic period look - even the industrial townscape looks correctly period - the industrial buildings are of WW1 vintage. The central character was something of a sticking point for me. Porcco has the head of a pig (never explained) but hidden behind large sunglasses, a wig and a hat pulled well down, almost nothing other than the mouth is visible. All that expression that a live actor would give was thus missing. Added to which (or perhaps subtracted from which) was the flat, grating and inexpressive voice (in the English version at least) of Michael Keaton. Amusing characterful actors with many great live action movies to their credit can become very flat when dubbing foreign language movies. Often the actors are personalities rather than voice artists (contrast for example The Simpsons where it is primarily the marvellous array of voices which give the animated figures life and character). It may have been better to have watched a subtitled version of the original.It seemed to me that not all the elements necessary for a great animated movie are here. The animation itself was generally excellent, the story was quite engaging, sometimes amusing but not tremendously involving, the main character was not involving. Animation was 8/10, the remainder 5 and 4 out of 10. Some of the quirkyness and unexplained parts may be due to its origins first as Manga later expanded to this full feature length which suggest why it is not the masterpiece it is sometimes credited to be.A historical point: the character Curtis. When Porcco's plane is being (re)built the special engine is said in the English language version at least to have been taken from a Curtiss aircraft, winner of the 1927 Schneider Trophy race for the world's fastest aircraft. The actual winner in 1927 was a British Supermarine S5 powered by a British Napier Lion engine. The winner in 1925 was a Curtiss Aviation sea-plane. Glen Curtiss the founder is presumably the inspiration for the character of Curtis, pilot and Porco's love-rival. One of Glen Curtiss's achievements had been the world land speed record on a motor-cycle - 136mph in 1907!"
29,Porco Rosso,8,20 August 2017,"When Pigs Fly, There's Coolness in the Air...","First of all, what a premise! Seriously, any screenwriter could have written the strangest and most compelling story about a man with a pig's head but Miyazaki turns him into a World War I veteran, an ace seaplane pilot and freelance bounty hunter... who ""happens to be a pig"". Not only that, but his head doesn't even make people turn theirs, while it's not the least noticeable trait and it inspires a few practical jokes here and there, ""Porco Rosso"" is no excuse for pig jokes, it's a legitimate story and another fine making from the master of animation in his favorite setting: sky (and water since the film deals with hydroplanes) and characters behaving in a realistic, touching and occasionally funny way.""Porco Rosso"" isn't even a character study, it's a lighthearted adventure movie with a fair share of action and romance, set in the Adriatic Sea circa 1929-1930 when Italy was soon to be undertaken by the fascist regime and many ex-pilots were looking for professional conversions, some in piracy, some in Hollywood, some in between. Marco (our titular Porco) is specialized in bounty hunting and is quite good at it, he makes enough money to enjoy agreeable moments of idleness with a good wine, a pack of cigarettes and a nice song, ""bon vivant"" like any Italian mano. So, when the film starts, he's inhabited with such an aura of coolness the mystery of his appearance is almost secondary. What's more everyone is accustomed to his face and he's such a fully developed character that his condition ceases to be a flaw, it even gives him a weird charm or edge over the other men, especially with the lovely Gina, a singer and restaurant owner.The relationship between Marco and Gina provides the first hints about Marco's past. After a successful mission, he goes to a restaurant and you can tell there's some history between them. Gina had just lost her third husband, a pilot and friend of Marco, and somewhat she seems to have very strong feelings toward him. Their dialogues resonate almost like something you would hear in a Humphrey Bogart movie, that's how cool Marco is, and mature by animation's standards. See, I made an experience, I closed my eyes a few seconds and I could swear I was listening to a real movie(not to mention that he's voiced by Jean Reno in the French version and I was gladly surprised by the fact that Miyazaki found it better than the original voice).So, Marco is a pig by face but perhaps the least cartoon-like animated character I ever saw, which reinforces the credibility of the movie and the relationships between Porco and Gina, and later, Fio, his mechanic's teenage granddaughter and engineer with a love for planes that echoes Miyazaki's own passion. Fio is the typical Miyazaki girl except that she's a supporting player, like Mononeke, Nausicaa, and Kiki, she embodies the power, courage and free-spirited nerve of girls and women who had to show that their spirit was bigger than their muscles to earn men's respect. Ever since I saw a big warrior being reduced to stunned silence in ""Princess Mononoke"" by one of the female villagers, I knew there was something 'different' in Miyazaki's approach to the female persuasion (no pun intended) and a similar scene happens when little Fio manages to talk the big pirates out of killing Marco in exchange of a deal. And when you look at the film's big picture, you realize that female characters steal the show. During the hostage scene, little girls are excited by being kidnapped by pirates and you almost feel sorry for the bad guys, Gina is enamored with Marco but not to the point of hiding her resentment, and it's old women who repair Marco's damaged plane. It's better than feminism because all these female protagonists don't try to act ""like men"". And why should they anyway? In ""Porco Rosso"", men are like children, players who're so busy making war they're incapable to act reasonably, if Marco can't see that Gina is in love with him, Curtis, the main antagonist is a buffoon who asks every pretty girl for marriage, and that goes for Fio too, and the pirates are never as dangerous as they seem and even the climactic fight turns into a big joke without making them look ridiculous. Maybe it's the one little problem with the film, it doesn't really involve you in situations where you feel one's life is threatened, Marco plays it cool and the bad guys aren't so bad. Maybe the central point of the film is his identity and how he can go back to normal, Fio even wonders if it works like fairy-tale. The question is so thrilling that Miyazaki for all his realistic approach, leave us wondering all through the film. Of course, the film isn't totally a fairy tale, although it has an enchanting quality about it, but it especially works as a love letter to aviation and Italian legends that inspired Miyazaki to name his studio after an an Italian engine.And there's the humanistic side, what the film says about war's futility from the perspective of a man whose curse was caused by that very futility, in an episode I won't spoil but that reflects the tragedy with the kind of poetry only Miyazaki can express. Women are entrapped in this world, forced to resort to nostalgia like Gina who keep singing ""Le Temps Des Cerises"" and Fio who almost jeopardizes her future by marrying someone she doesn't like, out of love for her pilot.Porco Rosso, if not the most 'iconic' Miyazaki film strikes for its simplicity, its matter-of-fact way and its lead character, by many aspects, it's a minor Miyazaki film, but what does 'minor' mean when the other movies are all classic masterpieces."
30,Porco Rosso,8,11 August 2014,"This film is complex, just like the human society is.","Although the multi-language opening text that appears at the beginning of the film could be confusing, it is adorable and creative. Porco Rosso (1992) is not an ordinary animated feature. It has depth even though it could be weird as it has an unusual heroic protagonist named Marco Pagot who is half human half pig, similarly like Pigsy but is a major celebrity in this film. What captivates me the most are the elements of this film especially the people and culture in the World War era. This bizarre film could also easily pass as a feminist film since there are plenty of strong female characters of all ages and different backgrounds but then again, it is actually also quite masculine since the main character is slightly male chauvinistic and there are plenty of other male characters as well. This film is complex, just like the human society is.Even so, Porco Rosso (1990) is enchanting as it champions love and honor. You should watch this film if you haven't because it's quite fun and interesting to watch!PS. There could be Porco Rosso 2 and we can only wait for its news."
31,Porco Rosso,7,18 August 2013,Not only for fans,"Another original idea from the mastermind Hayao Miyazaki, a picture with cute humor and stunning animation, it is as absorbing to watch as always. This picture has a very comical atmosphere, which make you grin all the way through, the background, landscape, clouds, with the sun peeking up, its all very pleasurable to watch. A cute symphony is added, adapted to every situation we come across, Miyazaki was able to create this suitable soundtrack which made the picture even more captivating. Miyazaki being responsible for directing, writing and composing, one can wonder how he manages it all, it once again shows his brilliance. The main character, Porco Rosso, is a cursed human, who now is a pig, although the only thing that the curse changed was his appearance, being a war hero he is admired by many people, a pilot, Porco is one grumpy character, agonized of what he has become, although amusing to watch. Overall, this movie is entertaining, creative ideas and a brilliant animation, an enjoyable flick."
32,Porco Rosso,10,12 October 2012,Adult escapism.,"Of the Miyazaki canon, several films are often put forward as the ""best one"". The anime fans usually tip the epic ""Nausicaa"", while most regular Japanese people go with the nostalgic masterpiece ""Totoro"". People with less emotional connections with the older works will tell you ""Spirited Away"". For a solid minority though, including myself, ""Porco Rosso"" will always be no. 1.The main reason: the narrative here is not carried by children, who, in Miyazaki films, are nearly always portrayed as uncomplicated, morally perfect little heroes. As charming as they are, once the action stops things get boring really quickly. In Porco Rosso, the characters are fun, memorable, and often deeply touching.Second reason: Miyazaki is at his best when he's directing in the air: the epic air battles in Nausicaa, the fantastic flying ships in Laputa, ... and in Porco Rosso he's in the air almost ALL THE TIME! Everything about the planes is done just so ... damn... well. Exhibit A is the opening sequence. The pacing is sublime. The camera movements and animation of the planes in flight, breathtaking. Best opening scene of any movie I have ever seen, bar none.Like many Miyazaki films, it wanders a bit too much in the middle section and has a weak, contrived third act. Unlike many Miyazaki films, though, it has the good sense to end on the offbeat, rather than spell a generic happy ending out point by point.The attraction of this film is the escapism, the unabashed romanticism: we can so easily imagine we are Marco, flying our red seaplane to Madame Gina's island hotel under the starry Mediterranean sky. The animation, characters, music, and overall attention to details draw us in to this world, time after time."
33,Porco Rosso,6,17 May 2012,The most Underrated Miyazaki Classic everyone must see for it's unique style of storytelling,"It's funny how renowned directors like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg are extremely well-known for their works and still some of their finest, critically acclaimed works go unnoticed by audiences and the die-hard fans. In Scorsese's case, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore could be a perfect example and in case of Spielberg it's The Color Purple. And in case of Hayao Miyazaki's, it's Porco Rosso (Meaning ""Crimson Pig"" in Italian).At the time of it's production, this film was going to be a short film for the Japanese Airline that tells the story of a middle-aged ace pilot from 1930's Fascist Italy who was cursed to become a pig. As it turns out, the film became a full-length feature. After seeing all 9 out of 10 Miyazaki films, this was my final one. What I felt during Porco Rosso was that Miyazaki tackles more bold issues, much bolder than his other films. Porco is not a children's character but one of those guys who drinks a lot, smokes a lot i.e. he represents perfectly an old dead beat pilot trying to find nothing but peace in his life. He is not a character you could learn something from, not a usual theme in Miyazaki's films. What is his role then? In the film it's chasing pirates, running away from the air-force, getting involved in ridiculous fights, etc. Miyazaki offers a different point though by saying that every middle-aged man is a pig and Porco Rosso in this film is simply resembling to that fact.So this was about Porco Rosso (His real name is Marco Pagot). The other characters like Gina his love, the pirates, the American aviator who challenges Marco to a combat and there's Fio the cute girl who repairs Marco's plane were captured as usually marvelously by Miyazaki's lavish brush strokes. The story takes place after World War 1 in the Adriatic sea. Thus Miyazaki was challenged to draw a totally different culture which he pulls off successfully. What more lovely about this film is that it stays completely true to history (The war, I mean) and uses this as one of the driving forces in the film. It's just wonderful as it is with all Miyazaki films. Though I have to say that this film is more confusing and subtle in it's way of storytelling. Because Miyazaki also tackles completely newer themes that are even different from other animated films in the world, both fans and non-fans are in for a treat. My conclusion is that Miyazaki triumphs yet once again in his stellar career and has made the most ""unique"" animated film I have ever seen proving why I am a very huge fan of his. The Most underrated Studio Ghibli film yet Highly recommended.Like my facebook page: www.facebook.com/filmsthemostbeautifulart"
34,Porco Rosso,9,6 February 2012,Porco Russo Soars to the Top,"A must see for anyone who likes classic action-adventure or Studio Ghibli. Before seeing it, I wasn't sure how much I would like a film with a pig as the star. But once the movie started, I didn't even think twice about it. This film has a different, more mature feel to it than other Studio Ghibli movies (and obviously not from the PG rating.) It's romantic without being mushy, and is laugh out-loud funny. Plus, it has positive female role models (come to think of it, a lot of the Ghibli films are girl-power flicks.) Fun for the whole family. I'm glad I just saw it so I don't have to wait long for the sequel coming out in 2012 (20 years after the first.)"
35,Porco Rosso,8,19 October 2010,Porco Rosso is that rare animated film that will be enjoyed more by adults than by children.,"Porco Rosso is a sympathetic nod from a middle-aged man to his contemporaries, to all the guys who had the same dreams of changing the world, getting the girl, and winning the race, and somehow found themselves transformed into stout, middle-aged men with not much to show for all those ideals and dreams. It's also a wonderful children's film. There's a wonderful cast of characters. Every frame is well crafted, with some of the most marvelous aerial sequences ever animated and skies so exquisite the background painters should be designing for God. Joe Hisaishi's score is perfectly matched to the flow of every scene. The script is nicely paced, with the gradual, almost casual building of the main characters flowing so naturally from the action that it looks effortless. The director's political and social concerns are as clear as ever. Ultimately it's Porco Rosso's magnificent flying machines that are the star turns here. Their sleek designs, based on 1920s Italian models, and their thrilling animation are where Hayao Miyazaki's imagination really takes flight."
36,Porco Rosso,9,27 July 2009,Beautiful and imaginative- a very charming film from Studio Ghibli.,"The thing I like most about Studio Ghibli's films are that they are always beautifully animated and nimbly voiced. Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away are my favourites, but I will say that I love all the Studio Ghiblis for differentiating reasons. Porco Rosso is a very charming animated film, that is very imaginative as well. The animation is just stunning, with vibrant colours and picturesque Italian landscapes. Also the visuals with Porco's plane is just mind blowing. The visuals are perfectly matched by a truly beautiful music score, that helped make it a very relaxing watch. The story is a very intriguing one, and original, the characters are engaging and the story is of good quality. The English vocal characterisations were excellent, Michael Keaten being the biggest surprise, voicing a hugely engaging character, and while not exactly handsome, Porco has a heart of gold and genuinely cares for Fio, beautifully dynamic voice work from Kimberley Willaims-Paisley. Cary Elwes is also impressive as Curtis, Susan Egan is lovely as Madame Gina and David Ogden Stiers as Piccolo brings some well timed comic relief to the role. Overall, a stunning animated film, yes the ending is a little ambiguous, but Porco Rosso is well worth watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
37,Porco Rosso,9,28 September 2008,Miyazaki's tribute for flying and old Bogart films,"The film is set in the 1920's Europe, when the sea planes ruled the Mediterranean. The main character is Marco, a pilot of a red aircraft, who for some unknown reasons happens to look like a humanoid pig and for this has earned a local nickname Porco Rosso. He spends most of his days flying with his plane, making the lives of many air-pirates in the area difficult and meeting with a beautiful Miss Gina in the local restaurant that she owns. Marco's easy life however gets complicated when an American pilot Curtis comes around to challenge Marco for the title of best pilot. Also, a young mechanic girl named Fio gets in the picture.""Porco Rosso"" (Kurenai no buta, 1992) is once again a proof that Hayao Miyazaki is the grand master in the area of animations. Miyazaki's long time obsession with flying and aircrafts has shown in his previous movies also (especially in ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"") but in ""Porco Rosso"" he truly gets to put his visions to screen. The many sequences of flying are visually stunning, so that even when flying is a common element in animations, ""Porco Rosso"" towers above others in this area. Animation is once again simply great and Joe Hisaishi never fails to make a perfect soundtrack.The story is very easy going, almost like an old time adventure film from the 1930's and 40's Hollywood. The character of Marco also has many qualities that many of Humphrey Bogart's roles at the times had: the way he dresses in civil, the constant drinking and a little bit of cynical touches in his views of life, but despite them he still does what is right. Marco is very lovable character, no matter how grumpy he appears (lighter version of Dr. House, if you prefer). Also his on/off romance with Miss Gina is interesting to watch.""Porco Rosso"" is another sample of the Hayao Miyazaki's great works. It is also a fantastic tribute for his love towards flying and plane as well as an interesting animated version of Hollywood's old classic films."
38,Porco Rosso,8,2 September 2008,Miyazaki's Flying Pig,"Like all of Hayao Miyazaki's films this is an utter delight and is suitable for all but the youngest children to adults.Porco is a pilot who became a pig after an event in the First World War, he now earns a living as a bounty hunter flying around the Adriatic in a distinctive red sea-plane. He helps protect the shipping from the air-pirates who, being no match for him, seek the help of Curtis, an American pilot looking to make a name for himself by shooting down Porco. In their first confrontation Porco is shot down and has to take his plane to Milan by boat to get repaired.When he gets there he goes to the place he usually goes for repairs and is surprised to find that the repairs and upgrades will be designed by Fio, a seventeen year old girl. While he is there he learns that the new fascist government wants to arrest him and put an end to the unregulated pilots of the Adriatic. Reluctantly he takes her along when he returns to his island in the Adriatic which leads to a rather unusual bet when he battles with Curtis once more.As one would expect from Miyazaki the animation is stunning, especially his trademark aerial sequences, the story is well told and enjoyable. As with all of his films there is a strong female character in the form of Fio.This review is based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles. I have seen it in English when I showed it to my nephews, aged six, eight and fourteen, and they really enjoyed it."
39,Porco Rosso,6,14 August 2008,Good Miyazaki!,"Just got done watching the dubbed version of Porco Rosso. I don't think it was good enough to add to my Miyazaki collection, but it was very cute. The dubs were pretty bad, typical of most Miyazaki dubs. But the story line was good. And it was refreshing seeing a Miyazaki that didn't take place in a completely made up world. I'd suggest seeing it, especially if you are a Miyazaki fan. But it's stupid to say that, since if you are, you've already seen it. For those of you who aren't regular anime fans, or you have no idea who Miyazaki is, this is still a good watch. Though I'd probably suggest you cut your teeth on something a bit more audience friendly, such as Totoro, or Spirited Away."
40,Porco Rosso,,29 December 2007,Moving masterpiece from the magical Studio Ghibli.,"Porco Rosso is a film that I have fond memories of, having first seen it during the early half of the mid-nineties as part of a Sky Movies double alongside Miyazaki's more acknowledged early masterpiece My Neighbour Totoro. Totoro is a fantastic film, one that can be enjoyed by an audience of any age, but it is the sublime Porco Rosso that always had the greater resonance for me, and as a result, is the film that I have returned to again and again over the course of the last decade.The story is more complicated than some of Miyazaki's previous (or indeed, later) works, with the narrative unfolding around our titular central character, an Italian First World War fighter pilot (literally) cursed with the features of a pig, now living as a freelance bounty hunter chasing ""air pirates"" in the Adriatic Sea!! The reason why Porco has been cursed is never fully explained, with Miyazaki leaving only the vaguest suggestion of clues and hints before getting on with the more serious story at hand. Here, unlike great films such as Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, Miyazaki takes a story that is rooted in a recognisable historical period, choosing to focus on the era between the first and second world wars, the rise of Fascism and the great depression (which is here referenced on separate occasions). Added to this, we also have notions of romance (with Porco's relationship with hotel/club owner Gina perhaps offering a sense of redemption), the central adventure story involving Porco and the ""air pirates"", as well as feuds and rivalries (chiefly between Porco and the chauvinistic American pilot Curtis) and even a father/mentor type relationship to be found between Porco and his young aide Fio.The film moves along at a great pace, offering moments of jaw-dropping action/animation and some wonderfully rendered character interaction. As with all the films from the Studio Ghibli production house, the animation here is staggering throughout, with Miyazaki demonstrating an intuitive grasp of how to capture, not only the dizzying scenes of action and mid-air acrobatics, but also the dramatic scenes too. The colours are strong and capture the feeling of time and the essence of the place and period, whilst the overall attention to character depth and detail goes great lengths towards cementing the backdrop of the story and also the believability of the characters. Like the most recent Miyazaki/Ghibli production, Howl's Moving Castle, Porco Rosso is a film that will appeal to children, but will also offer deeper themes that can be enjoyed and appreciated by adults and adolescents. The historical and political aspects for example are well handled, offering a further arc to the main story, without getting in the way of the action or the characters.In this respect, Porco Rosso could very easily be considered a perfect film (for me at least), with several of the plot strands (amongst them the delicate romance between Porco and Gina, which seems positively pregnant with a subtle sense of sadness, as well as the different relationships that Porco has with Fio and Curtis) reaching a real emotional peak, whilst even managing to remain in my thoughts for the best part of a decade!! The film might lack an obvious sense of closure, leaving many aspects of Porco's past-life completely vague, but for me, this simply created a sense of mystique and a reason to see the film again!!! Porco Rosso is a magical film, and alongside works like My Neighbour Totoro, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, is a masterpiece from the always magnificent Studio Ghibli."
41,Porco Rosso,7,24 November 2007,"PORCO ROSSO (Hayao Miyazaki, 1992) ***","This earlier Miyazaki is (perhaps thankfully) less ambitious in scope than his later and more renowned work but, as a result, it has a greater warmth with engaging leads and several lively action sequences at the service of a somewhat dreary plot. The story deals with a reckless Italian pilot who has mysteriously been turned into a pig after his comrades have all perished during a mission; he still flies as a pig (hence the title) and spends his time chasing pirates of the air.The bulk of the narrative is taken up by the rivalry between Porco Rosso (literally Crimson Pig) and an American flier who wants to be a movie star; this enmity involves Porco’s long-suffering bar hostess lover and his teenage female mechanic and which climaxes in a highly enjoyable aerial dogfight-cum-fistfight ending with both contestants black and blue; the pirates of the air, who in the opening sequences are shown clumsily kidnapping 15 schoolchildren, are all in love with Porco’s girl and are eventually reformed by his mechanic’s charms.The film does have its more sober passages (especially when, in one of its visual highlights, Porco is forced by the girl to reminisce about that fateful mission) and even has a bittersweet ending – but it’s the overall genial tone which eventually endears it to the viewer."
42,Porco Rosso,7,15 September 2007,"Light adventure: fun, but no gravitas","A bit of magic? Check. Precocious young woman? Check. Flying? Check. Lots of white people speaking Japanese? It's gotta be a Miyazaki film. Porco Rosso is quite unusual for a Miyazaki film in that its protagonist isn't idealistic, precocious and young, but rather is an older cynical bounty hunting flying ace cursed to look like a pig. The titular Porco has more to do with Han Solo than Luke Skywalker.However, the film is still very clearly a Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli work. Set near the time of WWII in the Adriatic, Porco makes a living as a wing for hire. This is thrown off by the introduction of American flying ace Curtis who joins the pirates Porco has foiled in their revenge on Porco. And that's about it when it comes to the story. Porco Rosso doesn't set a very high story bar, as the story itself it rather weak. The film comes across more like an extended episode of a television series. Granted, an excellent episode, but not an ambitious one. Although life is on the line for some of the characters, the gravitas of the film is very low, consequently leading to little tension and consequently little release.Thus the story of the film itself fails to deliver the kind of impact that most of Miyazaki's works have. But the film is still gorgeous and have a sense of fun, just not really a strong sense of magic or adventure. It's almost like a watered down Indiana Jones movie. However, I can imagine this film being the basis for an excellent television series featuring the titular pig.The characters are drawn well and the film has a rather fun sense of humor about it (see the kidnapped schoolgirls in the opening of the film), but ultimately doesn't really accomplish the sense of adventure that I think it was set out to accomplish. It comes across as light entertainment--fun, but insubstantial and consequently not a must see. But if you're looking for a sort of light adventure with a Ghibli twist, this isn't bad. Just don't have expectations for an immersive and rewarding pic. 7/10."
43,Porco Rosso,,9 August 2001,Pride and machismo of a pig...,"In the late-1920s Adriatic, Porco Rosso is a bounty hunter fighting against aerial pirates. Despite the weak plotting, typical of most Japanese anime, Miyazaki's interest in odd flying machines and a sense of honour and humanity pervades. The premise of this film is that the veteran WWI fighter pilot, Marco Rosso has renounced his humanity and as a result, has been turned into a pig (hence the name, Porco).His renouncement of humanity can be seen in part, as atonement for his actions during the war, mourning for lost friends and a protest against the destructive forces of nationalism that leads countries into conflict. This notion is expressed in a form of dreamlike sequences from his combat as well as in his dislike of the fascist regime that is coming to power in Italy.As with many Japanese films, both anime and otherwise, the plot suffers from preoccupation for background detail and not enough on narrative structure. At the same time, some of the sugarcoated sentimentality and romanticised idealism may be difficult to accept, even if detected as such and not simply missed in the translation. What we do learn however, is that despite his appearance, his sense of humanity and honour is alive and that it is his pride and machismo that is preventing him from becoming a man again. Despite all its failings, the film is beautifully rendered and alongside Nauscica, the one that most closely reflects Miyazaki's own interests and ideals."
44,Porco Rosso,7,24 June 2005,a good film that just ends abruptly,"This is a beautiful film and I longed for its domestic release. Unfortately, I felt very disappointed at how the movie just abruptly ended. It looked as if they were on some sort of deadline and since they were running behind, they just ended the film! It's a real shame, as up until the ending, the movie was great--exceptional animation and direction throughout! I've seen many Miyazaki films and this was the first that disappointed me (though, I must admit when I saw Nausicaa I was even more disappointed). Instead, try watching Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke or Castle in the Sky--all are much more complete and satisfying Miyazaki films."
45,Porco Rosso,10,27 February 2006,Beautiful masterpiece,"This has dropped slightly in my esteem since my first viewing, when I thought of it as Miyazaki's second best and one of the best ever made. Well, yeah, actually, I still consider it one of the best films ever made, but that definitely covers everything he's ever done. What can I say? I'm an unabashed fan. Porco Rosso may be Miyazaki's most insubstantial. There's almost no plot, and what little there is is downright goofy. But that's okay. It's all a lot of fun. Miyazaki captures so many moments of sublime beauty that the film does indeed turn out to be something of a masterpiece. A small one, but a wonderful one. And I think the love theme of score is the most beautiful piece of music that Jo Hisaishi has ever written."
46,Porco Rosso,1,29 December 2017,Just why?,"I am sorry but what the hell is this film. This movie is just bad like seriously a mutated pig head, a male manager and all his workers are female. A 40 year old womaniser wants to get married to a teenage girl. Overall worst anime movie ever made."
47,Porco Rosso,9,8 May 2017,When pigs fly,"While I didn't find this to be one of Miyazaki's best films as many people thought, it was still awesome. What's really weird is that it tells the story of a pilot who was turned into a pig. That's about it. The fact that he's a pig really has little relevance on the story. It's actually completely realistic besides that. It's not like he uses his snout to save the day or he summons pigs in battle or something. He's a pig and that's it. Yes, I do finally realize it was meant to be a joke on the term ""When pigs fly"".Of all the Miyazaki movies, this one may be the funniest. While not an outright comedy, it really did seem to have more jokes than any of the other movies. That's why I love this guy for always experimenting with different genres. The animation and character designs are as gorgeous as ever. I was weirded out by how short this movie was, as Miyazaki's films are some of the longest animated movies ever made. Still, it didn't need to be long and that was another factor in how unique it was. ***1/2"
48,Porco Rosso,7,16 April 2017,A visual feast,"It was the cover art that really caught my eye (a WWI flying ace, looks like a pig; it's funny), but I really grew to like that pig, and the characters around him even more. ""Porco Rosso"" is such a quirky film (and therefore endearing), its heart belonging to classic aviation and the fighter pilots of the Great War. So much attention is paid to the detailed mechanics of those old biplanes. And as funny as it might be to have a pig for your hero, or how cool the aircraft are, this is hands down one of the most resplendent movie I've ever seen. The exotic locales, the eye-popping colors . . . and those clouds! I swear, this world's so fun to visit because of its eye candy.It's a charming little thing.7/10"
49,Porco Rosso,9,28 February 2016,Porco Rosso was so cute and so much fun; I highly recommend it especially for kids.,"In Porco Rosso, we follow an Italian WWI pilot who was cursed to look like a pig. The story consists of Porco fending off sky pirates and the attacks of an American ace in the inter-war period.This is a Miyazaki movie so, if you're familiar with his movies, it won't surprise you to hear that the animation is wonderful. It's colorful and happy. Porco's introduction and the introduction to his relationship with the pirates give you a good indication of the tone of the movie.We see Proco lounging on a secluded beach. He is called on the radio to go fend off some pirates who are robbing a cruise and, to make matters worse, they've captured a class of schoolgirls!Now, I cringed when I heard ""schoolgirls"" because, you know, I thought hyper-sexualized high school girls (aka early Brittany) but it was just elementary school children. I suspect it was a translation thing or maybe a cultural terminology issue. Anyway, we cut to the pirates and the one groans, ""Do we have to take all 15?"" ""Oh course! We can't split them up from their friends!"" And then they go on to let the kids climb all over the plane while being ""kidnapped.""Even when Porco comes to the rescue the scene is light-hearted. Porco shoots out the pirate-plane's engine and even lets them keep a little of their loot to pay for repairs. ""I don't want to be putting them out of a job,"" Porco explains.I saw the English dubbed version. I'm generally a proponent of original audio with subtitles but, in this case, the dub was perfectly good for the movie. Michael Keaton does a great job of voice acting Porco. The voice of Meg from Disney's Hercules is the voice of Porco's love interest. Do you remember Everybody Loves Raymond? Well, Raymond's brother (the one with the deep voice) is a pirate alongside the voice of Patrick Star from Spongebob Squarepants. The daughter in Father of the Bride voices the spunky engineer. It's a solid B-grade cast.When I was describing the cast to a coworker, he said that a mark of a good B-grade cast is when you say, ""Do you remember that show? Well, the side character from that show was in this."" That is, you know the actor not through their name but through a point of reference.I would highly recommend Porco Rosso especially for kids. It's fun and happy and I'll probably see it again at some point."
50,Porco Rosso,9,14 January 2015,A heart-warming tale with brilliant artwork,I loved every bit of the movie and the only reason I'm giving it 9/10 is because it ended too soon for me.This is the kind of animation movie that makes one feel good about living in this world. Such beautiful and breath-taking art work of the sky and numerous planes that fly in it! There is no real villain in this story and that is why it feels so good to watch it. It's a happy story (albeit a bit short) and the animation style is a treat to watch.The story is one that kids and adults alike will enjoy. And adults especially will enjoy it more as it brings back memories of a childhood of ambitious heroes and shiny gadgets. Porco Rosso himself is adorable and he made me nostalgic and happy at the same time.You should definitely watch it.
51,Porco Rosso,9,3 June 2014,Wild Fun,"I have very fond memories of this film. I saw ""Kurenai no buta"" (1992) as part of a retrospective of Miyazaki's works in Bologna presumably some five years ago, and I have fond memories not only of the film but the experience of seeing it in Italy (I'm an Italian teacher and studied at L'Università di Bologna). This is a wonderfully detailed trip to the Adriatic Sea and Milan, and the language is used to great effect. Yet what has stayed with me the most ever since is the wild sense of fun the whole film exudes. Now that I'm slowly marching through most of Miyazaki's oeuvre, it's a nice moment for a dear revisit.And wild fun it is, one of the funniest works of film art I've had the privilege to witness, including what I consider to be funny: ""Bakumatsu taiyôden"" (1958), the best of Chaplin and Keaton, ""The Falls"" (1980). If going to the movies would always be like this! I think the filmmakers' love for film can make the viewers love film, and this is an example of perfectionist, lovely filmmaking. Miyazaki is not only talented, he's intuitive and able to translate that intuition into the film. It's very impressive how he sculpts mood and atmosphere, at times lingering nostalgically, at others romantically, at others tragically. But the undersong is always satiric, heavily ironic and quite simply such a hoot there were many moments when I just couldn't stop laughing and applauding the wit and imagination behind it all.Much of this stems from Marco being such a marvellous character. Falstaffian in his glee, he embodies the film. Surrounded by beautiful women, Fio becomes our surrogate by the end, and Jina-sama (Gina) the other end of the spectrum; not rash and wild just as Fio, but reasonable, steadfast. It's a wisely and successfully created web of interaction.An etymological obiter dictum: the word that became part of the anime studio's name, ""ghibli"", is an actual Italian word. It comes from the Arabic ""qibli"", another word for the sirocco (the word ""sirocco"" comes from the Greek 'sirokos'). It was the point of Studio Ghibli to bring some fresh air to the anime industry. But the word has another context, and the film integrates it beautifully: ""Ghibli"" comes from the name of an Italian Caproni aircraft used in World War II, and in the film the new engine installed to Marco's aircraft bears the name. In that sense Marco's mission becomes not only the embodiment of Miyazaki and the studio, but also of a whole ideal. And still Marco, or the Marco in Fio (or vice versa), will always be our surrogate for adventure.It's a lovely ending, as well. During the whole film Miyazaki has played with us when it comes to Marco's spell, and much is made of how things seem. Yet, in a stroke of genius and wholly appropriate to the context of the film, we never really see. It's all a secret, that is, something so personal that it ceases to exist, in fact couldn't exist, in words or images. It is only implied, and then carried in our hearts."
52,Porco Rosso,10,9 March 2014,Miyazaki's most underrated feature,"On the surface, Porco Rosso (1992) is a lushly animated adventure flick with a tinge of nostalgia for the pilots of the 1920s. Underneath the skin, its a film fraught with anxiety about war and fascism. In some ways, it is like Miyazaki's first feature, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), a seemingly frothy popcorn film that contains well-hidden sadness at the core; however, here that sadness is much more visible.This seems to be one of Miyazaki's lesser known films for whatever reason. Is it because the main character is a middle aged man disillusioned with life instead of a child or teenager? Is it the pre-WWII setting? Is it the lack of fantasy elements (outside of the protagonist having turned himself into a pig, that is)? I don't know, but it's a shame."
53,Porco Rosso,9,1 January 2014,A Miyazaki Masterpiece,"Whilst arguably not Miyazaki's finest work, there's something about ""Porco Rosso"" which for me as an individual makes this 1992 Ghibli offering one of his more memorable. Set around Italy and the Adriatic sea during the interwar period (""when seaplanes ruled the waves""), Porco is a former pilot of the Italian Air Force, turned Bounty Hunter. After being forced to go to Italy to get his plane repaired, Porco embarks upon a heart-warming, action-packed adventure which challenges his views on women and on life. The film is visually stunning, with Miyazaki creating an idyllic image of the Adriatic and its islands, and with Joe Hisaishi's melodic, well-paced score, it is certainly possible to feel transported back in time to this epoch. The story never takes itself too seriously; The pirates are more comical than threatening, and cannot even really be seen as a primary antagonist, as even the supposed villains in the film have redeeming qualities (apart from the Fascists, the only ""real"" villains of the piece). This film is a light-hearted ,charming, heart-warming tale, complete with Miyazaki's usual charm and deeper views on feminism and fascism, and is a must-watch for any Ghibli fan. Perfect escapist cinema."
54,Porco Rosso,8,10 July 2013,When a pig flies.,"A very nice film, full of adventure, romance, humor, fun characters and beautifully made animations. Not as wildly imaginative as the (only) other Miyazaki film I've seen (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi aka Spirited Away), but very enjoyable nonetheless.The main character is a pig, who was once a man, who fights pirates for money. The opening, with the hilarious schoolgirls loving every minute of being hijacked and abducted by brutal pirates, sets the tone. There's quite a bit of action in it, but there is plenty of story beyond and in between, with some creative storytelling - for instance, the final fight doesn't even take place in the air.A big 8 out of 10."
55,Porco Rosso,8,2 January 2013,"Beautiful, Imaginative, Funny, Heartwarming","This is another brilliant movie from Hayao Miyazaki. He creates a beautiful world where Adriatic sea is controlled by Air Pirates. Where you can have your own hideaway island. Where you get around using your own seaplane. At it's core this is children's cartoon. It's very bright both in terms of atmosphere and colour. Maybe this is what made me like it so much as an adult. Watching this movie brought me back to my childhood when I used to dream of adventure. The movie is beautifully animated, full of humour and eccentric characters. There is a little love story. There is a little coming of age story. The plot is pretty straightforward but very consistent. Overall, an amazing movie, go see it."
56,Porco Rosso,10,19 December 2012,Another masterpiece by Miyazaki,"So we have, again, another film by my favorite director, Miyazaki-sama. How does it compares to his other films? Well, from 1984 to 2001 Miyazaki was on fire, making a masterpiece after another, Nausicaa was a 10/10 film, them Castle in the Sky, 10/10, then Totoro, 10/10, then Kiki's Delivery Service, 10/10, then this, 10/10, then Princess Mononoke, 10/10, then Spirited Away, 10/10. Perhaps the strongest run of films ever.Here we have the combination of first rate artworks, first rate music, provided by the talented composer, Hisaishi, and first rate dialogue and flawless execution and timing. A near perfect film, as many other Miyazaki films. Do you like films and don't have a prejudice against animation? See this."
57,Porco Rosso,8,1 July 2012,"Air pirates, beware! Here comes the best pig pilot in history","Porco Rosso is undoubtedly yet another precious anime produced by the fantastic Studio Ghibli. Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, it was originally intended to be a short. Fortunately, for the sake of great entertainment, it finally became a full-length film. Although it wasn't targeted at younger audience at first, I can really see why it is dearly loved not only by adults, but also by little kids. It is an unforgettable animation experience for the whole family.What's unconventional for this film is its realistic setting in time and space. There aren't many Ghibli works that show a story that takes place in a specific location, during an authentic period in the history of our world.Loved by women, loathed by men, Porco Rosso is an aging and tired aviation pioneer who once used to be an air pilot fighting for the Italian army in the Great War. However, on one of his last missions, when the enemies wiped out his whole squadron, he was mysteriously changed into a humanoid pig. Nowadays, his life consist of eliminating air pirates, rescuing kidnapped people, and living on a secluded island somewhere on the sea. One day, a handsome American named Curtis challenges him to a sky-high duel. After Porco's valuable and famous jet smashes into pieces and no one knows whether he survived or not, he is forced to visit his old friend and brilliant engineer Piccolo. He assigns the job of rebuilding Porco's plane to his granddaughter Fio, who turns up to be just as good as her granddad. Astounded by the magnificent job that she and her family did, Porco decides (maybe not at all purposely) to fight Curtis once again, in what turns up to be a fast-paced air combat turned boxing match. In all of its beautiful, colorful, and typically-Ghibli animation, Porco Rosso brings up some really serious and significant issues that arose in the inter-war period, namely the growth of fascism in Italy and gender discrimination. This is yet another reason that shows the abilities of Japanese animators and screenwriters, who, through marvelous anime films, are able to deliver a great story, which could have been as well made into a live action feature.The dubbing in the Disney version is really decent, as the voices are actually properly matched with all the appearing characters. So if you won't have a chance to watch the Japanese original with subtitles, be sure to check out the dubbed one.Even though Porco Rosso may not be the most emotionally engaging of Miyazaki's pictures, it still is altogether a visually impressive movie, packed with a well-developed story and many laughable and adorable characters. In the end, even the scary air pirates turn out to be more joyful and helpful than one might think."
58,Porco Rosso,8,11 January 2012,I'd rather be a pig than a fascist,"The opening sequence to Porco Rosso is a more or less perfect piece of filmmaking, an endlessly fun sequence where visual invention oozes from every square inch of the screen. There are so many wonderful touches here, from the cruise passengers directing traffic to the genial pirate gang. It perfectly pays tribute to the 30s serials that the whole movie is based around with an infectious joy that even the characters seem to be taking part in. This isn't an ironic in-on-the-joke enjoyment, but a heartfelt, pure film.The actual film after that opening is pretty good too. It seems to be a chapter cut from a longer tale, with the characters seeming like icons that must have existed before. The story doesn't begin or end within the film, and while that can be maddening -- the ending seems to deliberately taunt us with its lack of resolution -- it does create the sense of a larger, epic universe that is probably better hinted at than seen in full. (A good comparison is probably the Giant Robo series.)Porco Rosso isn't an especially deep or important movie, and you could probably deride it as a shallow stylistic exercise. But Miyazaki's enthusiasm is enough to sweep you up and make you forget about all your critical cynicism for two hours, and sometimes that's all you need from a movie."
59,Porco Rosso,8,3 January 2012,Fantastic,"One of the many triumphs of director Hayao Miyazaki, 'Porco Rosso' is not a cartoon of amazing sophistication (being simpler than, say, 'Princess Monoake'); but it simply tells an entertaining and original tale in which elements of the fairy-story are present, but not overly pandered to, set against the imaginatively unlikely backdrop of seaplane piracy in Mussolini's Mediterranean. The animation is pretty, but one mainly keeps watching because of the delights in the story, which keeps nicely one step away from where one might expect at all times. The ending in particular is nicely handled. I actually preferred it to 'Spirited Away', Miyazaki's most hailed movie."
60,Porco Rosso,7,9 January 2010,Trenchcoat Pig,"Rather slight and unfocused, but predictably beautifully mounted Miyazaki anime with a wonderful sense of time and space. It's as if a thirties Michael Curtiz or Howard Hawks action-drama had been filtered through Japanese perceptions.The pre WWII Mediterranean setting is a pleasure to behold as well as all the moving character depictions. Unfortunately, the storyline's strangely haphazard and neither as thoroughly entertaining nor as contemplative as the master's best work.Still, the aerial fights and some insightful moments compensate for the weak spots... and a lesser Miyazaki pic is still miles ahead of most animated movies.7 out of 10 silly Americans"
61,Porco Rosso,10,19 August 2009,Pigs Can Fly!,"Hayao Miyazaki's Porco Rosso is an entertaining experience, one that is a joy to watch. While it never reaches the heights of many of Miyazaki's other works, it is still a very respectable film from this Japanese animator.Porco Rosso is the story of an ex-World War 1 fighter pilot named Porco who has been transformed into a pig, the reason why is never fully explained. Porco spends all his time saving civilian ships from air pirates for money and taking refuge at his reclusive island hideaway. The pirates despise Porco and hire an American aviator named Curtis to destroy Porco for them, thus the adventure ensues.Porco Rosso is a zany, offbeat adventure/comedy that is at times both funny and exhilarating. The film is done in the style of pulp stories from the '30s and '40s. Everything is over-the-top ranging from the design of planes to the dialogue, but that is this films most charming aspect. While it may not be as deep as many of Miyazaki's other works, it is just so much plain fun to watch, who cares. Course the film is not just a quirky adventure, it also has a heart to it.Miyazaki has managed to inject some humanity within this odd adventure that comes through in droves near the end. While Porco may be cynical, he is extremely likable, and when he recalls the tale of when all the men in his squadron were killed except him, it is the finest moment of the film. As well Miyazaki shows his political side in this film, weaving in his thoughts on certain forms of politics, in particular fascism. Porco Rosso also happens to be a film that celebrates women. Miyazaki's feministic messages are layered deep within the story, from the strong and independent Fiona, to Porco's ship being rebuilt entirely by women. All of this comes together to elevate this film from a simple adventure romp to a fairly complex, but exciting film.While Porco Rosso is not my favorite work from Miyazaki, it is still a film worthy of his name. With lovable characters, some truly spectacular action sequences in the sky, and a genuine heart, this film manages to slot into the Studio Ghibli collection perfectly.I give Porco Rosso an excellent 10 out of 10!"
62,Porco Rosso,10,1 December 2008,"""I'd rather be a pig than a fascist""","We are in the Adriatic Sea, we see a lot of air pirates and there are some factors that can disturb these pirates, for example if their hostages are a bunch of little girls that are as cute as annoying as fearless or if Porco Rosso (Shuichiro Moriyama) is after them. We have a simple story, Porco Rosso is a great pilot, a bounty hunter and in short he is the terror of the air pirates that soon will bring a great American pilot (Akio Otsuka) to take the pig down, it will be like a personal thing and the American will attack first certainly, he will attack when Porco was not in conditions but Porco will return. This is the present story but once Porco was a true war hero, once he was a man named Marco, he is now alone, things changed, a curse transformed Marco into a pig, now he don't fly for the Italian Air Force, now he has a new life, certainly he knows where to go to fix everything related to his plane, a girl (Akemi Okamura) will change everything, she will not only repair Porco's plane but also she will give to Porco new hopes. The character of Porco Rosso is kind of classic, he is a master for what he does, he seems to have lost all the hopes, Gina (Tokiko Kato) is certainly someone important for him and she is waiting however the only man who came is the American, Donald Curtis is his name and being a famous pilot is only the beginning for him and the next step is to be a Hollywood star to finally be the president. He is a funny character, basically he ""falls in love"" once second after he sees a woman then when he sees the girl that changed everything for Porco and who now is his partner Curtis wants to marry her. Her name is Fio and when Porco first meet her we have a really nice part of the film, their story delivered a lot of great and funny things. Porco came to Milan expecting to have again his plane working, expecting nothing out of the common and certainly that a young girl was going to be the one working on the plane was the first surprise, there we see kind of a new Porco but the surprises won't stop since he sees that the whole team working on his plane is only composed by women, because of the Great Depression, and later he sees how Fio is making a place in the plane for herself. This girl was unique, teaching lessons even to the pirates! (the gang delivers a lot of fun), questioning their honor and finally becoming the prize for Curtis only if he can defeat Porco in the final dogfight that ends being a boxing fight! Only the two women know if Porco Rosso returned Since some months ago I have in my collection Porco Rosso on DVD, I have the DVD that is part of The Studio Ghibli Collection, Porco Rosso is the number 3 of that collection and once I bough the DVD I realized about the fact that it is a Region 2 DVD and is always known that here those DVDs are not compatibles. Not quite ago I had to get another DVD player and for my fortune and also surprisingly it is compatible with Region 2 DVDs. I'm still beginning with the work of Miyazaki, with Porco Rosso now I have seen 4 Hayao Miyazaki films (The Castle of Cagliostro, My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away are the others) and definitely with it I had my fourth terrific experience, I loved this film, certainly someone who is looking for another Spirited Away will not be pleased since this is not that type of Miyazaki film but definitely I highly recommend this one. Porco Rosso gets a 10, it is a great piece of animation!"
63,Porco Rosso,8,2 May 2008,"Good film, but not one of my favorite Miyazaki films","I first bought the film because of the strange picture on the DVD case and because I am a huge Miyazaki fan that guy is a genius! I enjoyed the movie a lot. The animation, music, voice acting, and story are all very unique. However I would say that overall this is my least favorite Miyazaki film. Not to say that it was bad, it really was not. Its worth watching but it does not meet the high standard he has set for himself, in my opinion. Even the worst thing Miyazaki could possibly make will still be much better than other anime because he is simply light years ahead of most other anime creators/directors. In conclusion I gave this film an 8/10 because it was enjoyable and creative, but is not his best work."
64,Porco Rosso,9,15 June 2007,simple pleasures and masterful film-making,"I guess when I first watched this film a few years ago I was expecting something a lot more epic and dramatic. At the end I wasn't sure what to make of it. I decided to watch it again earlier today, having seen a couple of very soulless movies recently. I don't often submit reviews, but I had to make an exception because watching Porco Rosso again was pure blissful enjoyment. It touched me in a similar way to Kiki's Delivery Service, a simple and sweetly poetic film that seems to reaffirm everything beautiful about humanity, while not straying anywhere near syrupy sentimentality or sledgehammer-like emotional manipulation.It's easy to see why people are perplexed by this film - it's a love story where the lovers never get together, the reasons for the hero's very odd anthropomorphic predicament are never fully explained, and the villains are all comically inept and quaintly endearing. I think, however, that you have to let go of preconceived ideas of what constitutes a good story and go with the flow. If you do, you'll really enjoy this film.Settings are mesmerisingly evocative and the animation is absolute perfection - even people who aren't charmed by the story cannot help being sucked in by the amazingly dynamic flight sequences. The scene where Porco's revamped seaplane rips through the canals of Milan is particularly breathtaking. It does not look at all dated, despite being 15 years old. In fact many modern films (animated and otherwise) could learn a lot from the subtlety, detail and understatement in its technical flawlessness.So many universal themes are explored very well in this film that it would take a very long essay to discuss them all. What impressed me most was what it says about freedom, and how man perhaps values it above everything else. It makes it very easy to understand why Porco avoids the love of two of the most unique and amazing women any man could ever hope to meet in one lifetime, because he finds happiness being at one with the sea and the sky.NOTE: I recommend seeing this film in Japanese with subtitles, instead of any dubbed versions."
65,Porco Rosso,10,5 June 2007,Another Miyazaki film that defies conventional feebleness,"Another home run for Miyazaki, Porco Rosso epitomizes what makes his films so superior. Here, Miyizaki breaks from his brilliant fantastical films for a more real metaphorical adventure, adding to his great body of work. The ending is somewhat predictable, but we don't anticipate the conclusion, we enjoy the ride there. Porco, a self-important bounty hunter is cursed with the look of a pig, but the appearance seems to be the least of his personality problems. The way the characters interact in the film brings out the beauty of the subtle metaphor. Much more attention is focused on Porco's character then his appearance, and with good reason. The other characters in the film are spirited and multi-layered. One admirable thing that occurs in many Miyazaki's films is the absence of a pure evil villain. We can just sit back and enjoy everyone, flaws and all. Life.Underneath this charming little tale, there's something profound lurking beneath the surface. What succeeds in the story is suitably matched by the animation. I'm not into planes myself, but the battle scenes displayed in the film were done marvelously. I was instantly engaged into this whimsical world that feels as natural as the reactions toward Porcco's appearance in the film. This film also has the greatest sense of humor I've seen from a Miyazaki film. A light touch that's just accessible to everyone. This is my first non-fantasy from the great director. Seeing this just increased my faith in the talent of the director. It's much more of a drama despite Porco's questionable 'curse'. All in all, this is just what makes the film leave a bigger impact. A superb accomplishment in story-telling and characterization that easily joins the ranks of ""My Neighbor Tortoro"" and ""Toy Story"" as some of the greatest artworks for children of all time."
66,Porco Rosso,10,22 September 2002,Certainly the Finest Animated Film Ever,"This is not Miyazaki's grandest work. Porco Rosso is no sweeping epic a la Nausicaa or (the disappointing) Mononoke Hime, nor is it a children's fable akin to My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service.Don't get me wrong, there's an ambition to the film. Porco Rosso is mythically powerful. It is uncompromising in its depth of emotion and allegory.It's small in the way that The Grapes of Wrath, The Four Hundred Blows, and Grand Illusion are small films.Okay, maybe I'm overstating things. Even so, I feel I can state with all sincerity that, in its lack of epic grandeur, this is as close as filmmaking gets to flawlessness.There is not a single scene I would cut. There is no character I would alter. The script, animation, and direction is lean, mean, and superb. Even the score is nothing less than perfect.Had Hemingway ever seen this film, I think he'd be torn between two impulses: this is the film I want to make and this is the pig I want to be.I think it would be hard to watch this film and not yearn for the Adriatic in those brief but halcyon interwar summers. Miyazaki perfectly captures the bittersweet psychological juxtaposition of the period: the lingering horror from the Great War, the trepidation engendered by the rise of Italian Fascism, and the romantic, crippling beauty of the aquamarine sea."
67,Porco Rosso,10,8 April 2005,"Funny, beautiful and unabashedly romantic","I unfortunately had to wait for a few years in order to see ""Porco Rosso"" for the first time; it was worth the wait.This is probably Miyazaki's most personal film and the loving attention it was made with is clearly visible, from the jaw-droppingly realistic flight sequences, to the lovely, Italian-flavored soundtrack. It is also one of the rare films that manages to perfectly balance slapstick humor, poignant yearning for that which is lost, and a notion of enduring, redeeming love(the scene of Gina's reminiscence is absolutely fantastic).If it has a flaw(IF),it would be the length-about 93 minutes-; I think there could have been at least 15 or 20 more minutes. But that's pure nit-picking. ""Porco Rosso"" is worth seeing, without a doubt."
68,Porco Rosso,8,2 November 2003,Miyazaki is God,"When I sat down to watch this, I had just seen Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa in the same day, and harbored doubts as to whether Miyazaki could do an all-out comedy. As it turned out, he is as unnervingly brilliant at evoking laughs as he is at fantasy. This is a rare animated film that works on every conceivable level, almost BECAUSE there's no compelling reason for it to be animated. Aside from the hero's identity as a pig (which is never fully explained, mind you), everything here is pretty much real-world (or the screwball comedy version of real world). The level of detail is, as expected, mind-boggling, and the flight models of the maneuvering planes are gorgeous. Fans of animation, aviation, comedy, or pretty much anything else should look into this."
69,Porco Rosso,,16 April 2000,Oink,"All I would like to add is that this movie contains what I believe to be the best animated fight scene of all time. It might be better than any live action fight, also. This is a really good movie. I think it's based on a true story."
70,Porco Rosso,,27 October 1999,"A heroic pilot finds honor after tragedy, and, oh yeah, he's actually a pig.","Most fans of Miyazaki like Naussica or Princess Mononoke. However, Kurenai no buta, or  ""Porco Russo"" is my personal favorite. It is Miyazaki's most understated film, the only thing that is truly fantstic is the main character being an anthropomorphized pig-pilot. Set in pre-WWII Italy, the animation and attention to detail is superb. The story is easy to follow even in Japanese, and it is equally as easy to relate to the characters. Look for this film, it may follow Princess Monoke in small runs and video translated to English."
71,Porco Rosso,,20 November 2010,Meh... it was okay,"It's not one of Miyazaki's best Ghibli films and definitely not popular. I first watched Porco Rosso at my cousins' house and I didn't like it. But since I accidentally turned it off and the DVD Player said put in a password, I couldn't watch the rest of it. I had to pick it up from the library and watched it and meh... it was okay.This movie is hard to explain but I'll try to explain. It's something about a drunken pig-man who flies an airplane, acting like a pilot and befriends this girl who looks about 18 and tries to fall in love with this virgin.This movie is not for little kids to watch. It's plot is too incomprehensible and the movie is just hard to understand for little kids. Have them watch something like Spirited Away or at least Howl's Moving Castle. If they want a family-friendly movie like My Neighbor Totoro, have them also watch Ponyo.The plot's a little predictable and the movie overall it's just boring. Watch some of Hayou Miyazaki's best films starting from 1984-04. Ponyo might not be your taste unless you like kid-friendly movies."
72,Porco Rosso,,1 October 2003,Verry nice!,"Verry nice! Loved this film, it was a funny film, made me happy. The animation and characters where great. But it was not deep enough to make an impression, although it was better than your run of the mill. It is not the kind of film you feel you want to see again. But it was well worth a watch. Average 8.7(10)"
73,Porco Rosso,,31 August 2012,Doesn't meet the standards of studio ghibli.,"Being a big fan of studio Ghibli's production, seeing this one was bit of a less than the usual. It is worth watching at least once but it lacks the cute and kind elements from the earlier films of this studio. The story is about a war time person who got changed into a pig, and since then has been doing the job of catching the pirates for the government. There is a good story to bind this, but it lacks the Ghibli mark. PROS:The girl feo is cute and energetic and she gives refreshing confident feeling all the time. The story gets very dominating in the middle.CONS:The end of the film was particularly unimpressive. The objective and message of the film doesn't seem to be clear enough. The pirates were shown extremely foolish and not funny.VERDICT: ""Watch if you are a big fan of animations."""
74,Porco Rosso,9,2 July 2006,Porco Rosso,"Porco Rosso was an excellent movie about a man named Porco Rosso who has the head of a pig after being cursed when seeing his fellow pilots rising into the heaven with other dead pilots. Porco Rosso is a bounty hunter for sea plane pirates but also he rescues captives that were kidnapped by pirates. After his enemy, Donald Curtis, busts up his plane, Porco goes to Milan to have his plane fixed by an old man named Picolo. There Porco meets Fio, the seventeen year old granddaughter of Picolo. Fio decides to accompany Porco on his journeys in the sky to be his ""apprentice."" This leads to several adventures with Fio, Porco, Donald Curtis, and the Sea plane Pirates. Set in Italy in 1930, Porco Rosso is very exciting and fun to watch."
75,Porco Rosso,,7 October 2005,My brief review of the film,"An inventive and often funny animated family film, some of the animation - particularly the fighting in the sky - is quite impressively done, and the characters are fun to follow around, even though they are extremely simplistic, and therefore sometimes funny for the wrong reasons. The accompanying music is at times reminiscent of Nino Rota, and is a delight to listen to. Towards the end, the film becomes a bit goofy, especially with the animated violence, however overall it is generally well-made and enjoyable to watch. It is not very deep, and it is awfully light-hearted, but it makes simply great light entertainment."
76,Porco Rosso,1,19 April 2009,It Sucks,"A shockingly overrated piece of art as well as a mind-blowingly overrated piece of cinema, this movie completely fails to attract the viewer's attention in any possible or desirable way, except in the sense of ""when - for - god's - sake - is - something - even - remotely - meaningful - going - to - surprisingly - happen - in - this - movie - or - shall - I - say - an - eye - watering - soul-sucking - imitation - of - a - desperate - storytelling - attempt - movie - aargh"" way (except for one particularly well-made scene near the third fourth of the movie, probably where the director had a look at ""Goodfellas"" and bitterly realised that his movie would inevitably fail not also as a watchable work of art, but also as the world's most unwatchable one, and miraculously abandoned chasing the purpose stated... at least for almost 2 minutes 40 seconds). Don't watch this. Please."
77,Porco Rosso,,9 December 2004,Great movie!,"Most of Miyazaki's movies are intended for adults, although it seems that it is for kids. Kurenai no buta, a.k.a. Crimson Pig or Porco Rosso, is his first and probably only movie that clearly shows that it is for adults since it focus more on romance than action. If you are expecting an action movie this movie might disappoint you. This beautifully drawn movie is about a pilot who is cursed and is transformmed to pig, and like the frog princess, he must be kissed by someone to transform back to human. Like I said, do not expect an action movie; this movie is intended for those who appreciate anime and is open minded. Because I am a huge fan of Miyazaki, I give this movie 8.9/10"
78,Porco Rosso,10,12 March 2003,A crimson pig with the voice of Leo the Killer,"Jean Reno is the French voice of Porco Rosso. It makes the whole film very entertaining and exciting. Myazaki made here another masterpiece, that can be enjoyed by kids as well as older people. The graphics are, as ever, amazing and the animation is so fluid you hardly would believe it made up of drawings. Great movie to show to your kids and to enjoy with them."
79,Porco Rosso,,6 May 2000,Animation as art,"This is one of the best animes I have ever seen; the animation is stunning, but the smart script and the interesting historical context makes it one-of-a-kind. It's got adventure, romance, comedy and action - the aerial fight scenes are among the best ever on celluloid - animated or filmed. The characters are pretty well designed - ""Porco Rosso"" simply oversteps the boundaries of regular animations (sadly, pretty limited nowadays). Recommended for ages 4 - 104."
80,Porco Rosso,10,15 November 1999,A beautiful small story from a maker of epics,I think this is my favorite Miyazaki work.  I prefer his small human stories over his epic battles of man vs. nature.  The small human touches are golden and will stay with you long after you leave the theater.  The first 15 minutes of this film with the pirates and the kindergarteners is probably the most enjoyable piece of celluloid you will ever see.
81,Porco Rosso,10,20 March 2005,Pigs fly in Miyazaki's oddest outing yet.,"Of the films by Hayao Miyazaki I have viewed thus far (keep in mind that I have yet to see HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE), PORCO ROSSO is my least favorite. Alternately known as THE CRIMSON PIG, this gorgeously animated yet oddly themed tale about a tormented pilot transformed into a pig was the highest grossing movie of its year (1992). But I didn't find PORCO ROSSO as captivating as Miyazaki's other films; perhaps because I've been spoiled by the adventurous spirit and imagination of NAUSICAA, CASTLE IN THE SKY, and PRINCESS MONONOKE, the whimsy and charm of KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO and the surrealness of SPIRITED AWAY. The film eschews all these to tell a story geared more toward grown-ups than children.With the exception of one mystified moment of imagination (a flashback sequence involving fallen airplanes ascending to a streaming trail of vapor--Airplane Heaven, perhaps?), the overall movie is more rooted in reality. When concentrating on character development and breathtaking flight sequences in the sky, PORCO ROSSO is at its best. But occasional shifts in the plot feel more obtrusive than interesting, and consequently, I didn't find this movie as memorable as Miyazaki's other work. By the time the credits rolled, I was of two minds--this was a pretty, well, strange movie, but still good... it just didn't click with me as much. (Though I still give the movie my highest recommendation.)That said, I now have a huge amount of respect for PORCO ROSSO. And I owe it, mainly, to this new dub by Disney. I do admit to being skeptical about Michael Keaton as the pig-headed (pun-intended) protagonist. Not that I have anything against the actor or any sort of loyalty to the original Japanese seiyuu or Jean Reno (in the highly acclaimed French version), it's just that I had a vision on how Porco Rosso should sound, and Keaton was not it. After sitting through this dub, however, I lay my case to rest--Michael Keaton is an excellent Porco Rosso. His dry, deadpan delivery works in favor of the character's melancholy, cynical nature; but he's not afraid to let loose on the scenes where he's emotional either. The rest of the cast is equally well matched. Susan Egan plays the thrice widowed bar singer Gina with the same amount of sarcasm and vulnerability she gave Lin in SPIRITED AWAY. She also has a great singing voice--for continuity's sake, Disney had Egan redo Gina's siren song, and boy, is it beautiful. Cary Elwes turns in a gallantly boastful and hilarious performance as Porco's rival pilot, Donald Curtis, whose sole weakness is falling for every woman he sets eyes upon. (He also speaks with a surprisingly convincing Southern accent.) Deep-voiced Brad Garrett voices the ringleader of a macho band of seaside pirates with the kind of pomposity and heavy-weightiness you would expect, but also remembers to showcase the character's secretly softhearted nature. Although the banter between his pirate gang isn't as memorable as, say, Phil Hartman's Jiji from KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, or even the guys who played the Dola Pirate Gang from CASTLE IN THE SKY, the chemistry between this bunch of thugs is undeniably funny. David Ogden Stiers hams it up as Grandpa Piccolo, employing a thick Italian accent, which actually makes his character all the more amusing. It is probably daring to say that in every Disney/Miyazaki dub, there is always one actor standing out from all the others, practically stealing the show. In KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, it was Hartman; in PRINCESS MONONOKE, Keith David; in SPIRITED AWAY, Suzanne Pleshette; in CASTLE IN THE SKY, Mark Hamill tied with Cloris Leachman; in NAUSICAA, Patrick Stewart. So, yes, there is one such standout in this dub of PORCO ROSSO, and this time it's in the form of Kimberly Williams-Paisley. She does an absolutely bang-up job as the spunky, irrepressible engineer, Fio, who befriends (and becomes smitten with) Porco, and the chemistry between her and Keaton is a delight. As with KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE and CASTLE IN THE SKY, the script occasionally makes a habit of reinterpreting and/or altering lines for either comprehensibility, or for the sake of a goof joke. Writers Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt never overstep their boundaries, though, and remember to retain all the important lines, just like the aforementioned two dubs did (which were both scripted by John Semper, incidentally). All in all, I ended up enjoying the dub more than I thought; it really made the movie a lot better for me IMHO. I may not consider PORCO ROSSO my favorite of the works Miyazaki has done, but you're inclined to disagree. Besides, Miyazaki at his least is still highly recommended; you could definitely do a whole lot worse by missing out on a less memorable but still fabulous film."
82,Porco Rosso,,10 March 2005,Can't get tired of it.,"After seeing it in Japanese I thought the movie could of been better. But it got better after seeing it several times. After I saw the English Dub, it made me want to watch it even more. Micheal Keaton is a perfect choice for the WW1 Vetran Pilot Porco Rosso. Having Micheal Keaton doing the main character of this animated film made it more enjoyable than before.The movie is taken place in the late 20's, which is before WW2 occurred in Europe. The Animation, background, and characters are excellent. Has 2 references which Miyazaki likes to put in his movies, which are anything that can fly and pigs. It was one of the top movies in Japan of 1992, till Princess Mononoke broke it's record. And this is also known to be Miyazaki's last hand-drawn animated film(meaning it's not done with the help of computer).This movie is focused on Porco Rosso, a local bounty hunter for the Adriatic Sea who only gets rid of Sea plane pirates when it comes to getting paid. He lives on a deserted island with only his plane, radio, and tent. He's not a people person, but Anti-Social so he remains a loner most of the times. He rather be sleeping, listening to music, reading porno, and drinking wine than to fight against Sea Plane Pirates.He's well known to the Adriatic Sea till this Texan Pilot comes along to help the Sea Plane Pirates rob more ships. And he demands to have a dogfight against Porco to see who really rules the Adriatic Sea....To wrap up this review, this is the kind of movie to see again and again. The Japanese version is fine, but I think the English Dub was well made and very true to the story. Porco Rosso is the coolest character you'll find in any of Miyazaki's animated films. I give it 8/10."
83,Porco Rosso,10,1 September 2002,A Masterpiece,"I saw this movie for the first time some years ago. I have to say that it impress me when I noticed it was Japanese and no robots or superpowers where involved, and that it was settled in the 1930's. Instead, incredibly awesome drawings give life to a beautiful story of what's right and and wrong, without falling in the typical struggle between the good and the bad guy. There are no bad guys, maybe the funny and wild pirates, but even they have some moral values. If you haven't seen it, do. It's a must. By the way, Fio looks exactly like my first girlfriend, maybe that was an influence to my opinion. In a few words, a wonderful love story, but it's not a chick flick."
84,Porco Rosso,9,5 February 2001,"A flying pig, dreams and love equals great movie","All lovers of Japanese anime must see this movie. A tale for all ages, I found this movie to be a wonderful surprise on a late Saturday night filled with adventure, beautiful animation, simple but intricately woven storyline and colorful characters that everyone would immediately be drawn too. The music creates an atmosphere that allows the watcher to become a part of it and the story flows seamlessly.The story follows the adventures of Marco the flying pig and his trusty red airplane. He encounters all sorts of delightful characters all helping or hindering him in his search for the meaning for why he was a man who became a pig. Along the way the many meanings of love are explored and by the closing credits I found myself wanting to see more but understanding that the conclusion was as it should be. A movie to see with a great big bucket of popcorn or loads of ice-cream, wonderful to contemplate by yourself or watch with a large group of friends. I recommend this for people of all ages."
85,Porco Rosso,,29 December 1998,A beautiful story about a pig and his plane.,A story base after World War II where sea pirates and heroes for hire control the skys. Marco Poccilini must battle against his rivals to save the innocence of the young Fio. This Japanese animation has beautiful animation and stunning special effects to match any animation from Disney.
86,Porco Rosso,10,2 November 2016,One of the best,"If you only ever get to see one Studio Ghibli movie, then see Porco Rosso. The fact there's nearly 50,000 votes in IMDb for this movie, says a lot, and the movie it timeless.The colors are so beautiful and gorgeous, and the storyline is so touching and moving. It's Studio Ghibli at its best, and I wish there was a sequel. The movie draws much emotion, and the soundtrack is relaxing. The pig pilot is a lovable rogue, and I sometimes wonder what happened to him after the movie ended.I saw Spirited Away and unfortunately turned off after 15 minutes. I'm so sorry it lacked the emotional impact of Porco Rosso."
87,Porco Rosso,10,24 May 2016,The Red Pig for the Win!,"If you are a Miyazaki fan, you owe it to yourself to see this film. If you aren't familiar with his work, this might be an excellent introduction. It is less mystical than most of his other works, but contains many of the other main story elements that Miyazaki is fond of including in his films. The animation is gorgeous and the story is really fantastic! In typical Miyazaki fashion, lines between good and evil are somewhat blurry, although he does take a pretty hard stance against fascism (whew!). He masterfully takes a tale which is suitable for children and makes it simultaneously interesting and touching for adults. As a former military member, I actually choked up at one point in the film, which I won't spoil here with any details. It took me a little while to get used to Michael Keaton's voice as Porco (seriously, he's supposed to be Italian!) but it only took about 10 minutes to get past that and get caught up in the story. It has some blatantly silly plot devices, but they are forgivable as a children's story. Miyazaki effortlessly blends these elements with real drama, excitement and emotion that only adults and precocious children will truly appreciate."
88,Porco Rosso,10,26 November 2015,Fall Under Miyazaki's Spell Once More,"Some of Miyazaki's movies have more Miyazaki in them than others. Kiki's Delivery Service, for example, has a relatively low amount while The Wind Rises has an outrageously high amount. This film falls on the upper range of the spectrum. This film does not take place in Japan. It takes place in Italy, a place that has significantly inspired him: if you want proof, consider the Italian aircraft pioneer Caproni, who plays a part in The Wind Rises and designed the plane that is the namesake of studio Ghibli.The movie also is centered around aircraft and has a strong female heroine (or two). Now, if you needed more proof that this is a very Miyazaki-ey film, check out the main character. Porco Rosso (literally Red Pig, which I find hilarious) is grumpy and cynical, but not abrasive; reports say that the same could be said of Miyazaki himself. This is probably the closest Miyazaki has come to being a character in one of his films, something with helps flush out said character, and the film as a whole.Of course, some fine dub voice acting by one Michael Keaton does not hurt either (although, from what I hear, the French version of the film, where Porco is played by the famous Jean Reno, is even better.) In fact, all the voice acting is good at worst and great at best, something of which I am unspeakably glad. Poor voice acting could have ruined the dub, particularly considering it's one of the less fantasy-oriented Miyazaki films (no, I'm not saying that I have a lower standard for acting in fantasy movies, just that if you mess up the acting in 'real' films, you don't have much to stand on.Of course, the film isn't all grim and intense and devoid of whimsy or animated feats. On the contrary, it's one of the most humor-filled Ghibli films, something which I feel helps balance out its many dark currents. But there are probably the least amount of surreal sequences. There is one that comes straight to mind that has to do with a sort of jet stream of planes going through the heavens (my absolute favorite moment in the film, though to set it up would be to spoil). But compared to even The Wind Rises (which from animation to multiple dream sequences, is ethereal all the way through), this film is more terrestrial.As a coincidence, I'm listening to Porco Rosso music right now. It's strange how that works. Y'know, I don't know if it's fair to like films more because of this soundtrack, but I do. As a writer, I don't have all that much time to watch movies, but I can always listen to music. And I do. On average, I think I listen to music about eight hours a day. Naturally, most of it is orchestral, whether that be classical compositions, movie themes, or video game beats.Now, does this film fall into that category? Do I like it more than I would normally would just because of the soundtrack. The answer is... probably not. While the music is fine, particularly against the Italian vistas in the film, it is not the sort that makes me think better of the movie or even think of the movie at all. When I listen to The Legend of Ashitaka from Mononoke, I feel like nothing else in the world matters and that I am back watching that lovely, lovely movie. There are no tracks like that here.But at the end of the day, superlative lists of tracks are like sprawling city parks: it's nice if you have one, but it's not necessary. The music accentuates the atmosphere; that's more than enough. When you're flying alongside Porco above grass and to the sea in what I consider to be the finest flying seen ever that was 100% traditionally animated, you just need a the music to stroke your soulstrings. And that is exactly what this movie does.What sticks out to me in almost all of Miyazaki's later movies is how they're about the end of an era. Sometimes it's subtle, like in Spirited Away, when there's a few lines about how the spirit world is starting to fade away. Sometimes it's not, like in The Wind Rises, where the protagonist's age ends with the onset of the Second World War and Dream Caproni asks him, ""Did you use your ten years well?"" talking about what he said earlier, that genius only can produce for ten years.This film is sort of in the middle, though it's definitely on the side of more explicit. While there's no one discussing the end, it is made clear that Porco is a relic from a bygone era, and that there is no longer a place for him in the world. I wonder if Miyazaki, who as I've said, is as akin to Porco as he's been to any of his characters, felt like that. I wouldn't doubt it; this film was released in 1992, right as computer animation was starting to develop and Toy Story was being produced. He might have started to feel displaced, only ten years after he released Nausicaa.I feel the ambiance and color and culture of the Adriatic as I watch this film. It almost makes me want to check and see if I didn't magically go halfway around the world. Most importantly, this film makes me feel the characters and the story. The magic of Miyazaki is that his movies make you feel on that deep level that real life only rarely reaches, making you more involved in this fictional universe over the course of a few hours than you could ever feel in your own world and your own existence."
89,Porco Rosso,9,5 October 2015,A very funny yet good film!,"I finally got to see this in English dub on the Internet because honestly it is so frustrating to find this anywhere!Alright, let's forget this and I'll talk to you about how I felt!I thought the film was so energetic like with the amount of times seeing those airplanes flying over the place were just enjoyable to look at. I actually liked Michael Keaton's voice as Porco, it really suits him for his character! This probably must be his first voice over on an anime film or possibly more, I don't know lol.I thought Porco and Fio should've been a couple. Gina is like such a snob, I really hope they didn't end up to be together. I also hope there won't be any other sequels on this!"
90,Porco Rosso,,9 September 2015,Miyazaki's love letter to the early era of aviation,"It's no secret that Hayao Miyazaki is utterly fascinated by all things that fly, especially machines that fly. With the exception of Ponyo, all of his movies feature flying scenes, and you could argue that in the case of Ponyo the same aesthetic is still achieved. But none of his films capture the romantic side of flight better than Porco Rosso. If you haven't fallen in love with aviation by the end of this film, I'm pretty sure you have a fear of flying.The movie takes place in Italy in the 30s, between the World Wars. Porco Rosso is a veteran combat pilot from World War I, who now spends his days as a courier slash bounty hunter slash all around flying expert in the Adriatic Sea. Our story starts when an American ace pilot named Curtis arrives to challenge him to see which one of them is the superior pilot. Plus he's paid by air pirates, who are often harassed by Porco Rosso.Oh, and Porco Rosso is also cursed to look like an anthropomorphic pig. No reason, really. He just looks like a pig. Roll with it.What I like the most about this film is the atmosphere. It captures the essence of the 30s perfectly, the feel of Hollywood's Golden Age. There's piracy and fighting, but men still have a code. There's a hotel built on an island in the middle of the sea and there's a scene in the film where both Porco and the pirates hang around there together. Because they all respect the owner so much, it's an agreed no-fighting zone. For some reason that really speaks to me.And of course, because it's a Hayao Miyazaki film, the animation is utterly gorgeous, the music is hauntingly beautiful, the storyline is deep yet lighthearted, the characters are great and it's just tremendously entertaining for both kids and adults alike. There are some Studio Ghibli films that are better, in my opinion, but it's still one of the best films I've ever seen and its world is the one I'd like to live in the most."
91,Porco Rosso,,3 April 2015,Another Gem From Hayao Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli.,"Throughout his filmmaking career, the perfection with which renowned Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki has managed to express the serious themes in his films without ever taking away its childlike sense of wonder is the very reason why he's the best animation filmmaker of all time & one of the greatest storytellers to have set foot in the world of cinema.Set in 1930s Italy, the story of Porco Rosso follows the adventures of its titular character; a World War I veteran who now earns his living as a freelance bounty hunter & has been cursed to look like an anthropomorphic pig. When his plane is shot down by an American rival who was hired by airborne pirates, Rosso gets his plane repaired to get back at his rival.Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Porco Rosso features all his trademarks from pigs to aviation but it's the feminist themes that manage to stand out most in this picture & is wonderfully illustrated. There are moments when its hand-drawn animation is spellbinding to look at, pacing is finely controlled, background score is truly heartwarming & the voice cast chips in nicely.On an overall scale, Porco Rosso is another fascinating addition in both Miyazaki's & Studio Ghibli's repertoire and is a fine blend of quality direction, smart script, gorgeous animation, rich characters, vibrant themes & pleasing music. The drama stays light-hearted throughout its runtime, the themes touch on deeper issues than depicted yet its joyful atmosphere makes it a cinema that viewers of all ages can enjoy. Thoroughly recommended."
92,Porco Rosso,10,20 November 2014,Forgotten Hayao Miyazaki masterpiece,"Porco Rosso is probably one of the most forgotten pieces of work Hayao Miyazaki has ever done, with films like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke and Howl's Moving Castle releasing later on. It is such a shame as well because it is a great foreign language animated film.The titular character (voiced by Shuichiro Moriyama) starts off as a male chauvinistic pig, literally, of course, develops as a bit more of a feminist due to teaming up with Fio Piccolo (Akemi Okamura), due to the fact that all of Mr. Piccolo's grandsons are absent. Mr. Piccolo (Katsura Bunshi) says that his granddaughter Fio is young but unique, because she has a feature that her male relatives lack. At the same time, Porco Rosso develops a rivalry with Donald Curtiss (Akio Otsuka), who is a brash pilot who dreams to be a movie star. Also joining the cast of characters is Gina (Tokiko Kato), who starts as a love interest of the titular character, and The Mamma Aiuto Boss (Tsunehiko Kamijo) who was the quick tempered boss of Mamma Aiuto, a group of criminals.On to the other stuff, the music by Joe Hisaishi is beautiful, the animation is great and the characters are well-developed.This film is recommended to any animation fan."
93,Porco Rosso,8,2 August 2010,"Porco Rosso is easy on the eye, but lacks the finishing touch that might just make it a classic.","Porco Rosso came at a time when Hayao Miyazaki was starting to establish himself as one of the world's most creative traditional film animators. Before acclaimed hits such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away propelled him to god-like status, he had to make do with lower budget films like My Neighbor Totoro. Made in a period when Miyazaki was still refining his style, Porco Rosso ranks as one of his weaker efforts. But it's by no means average.Porco Rosso is set way back during the early 20th century. Curiously, Miyazaki opts for a talking humanoid pig as the film's central character; it's a strange choice as viewers are unlikely to relate to a human pig as well as a genuine human. But as the film progresses, and the characters develop, the film becomes more accommodating and less obscure. On the surface, Porco Rosso appears to be a colorful exhibition of aviation and dogfights. However, this is essentially Miyazaki's first attempt (albeit a stiff one) on the romance genre.As always, Miyazaki's works are perfectly realized and impeccably detailed. Porco Rosso shows hand-drawn animation at its very best. The story while lacking in dimensional quality works satisfactory at the linear level. The intentionally elaborate boxing sequence near the end of the film is one of the funniest moments in cinema. Porco Rosso appeals more to fans of Miyazaki, as well as older teens and adults; young kids will find this thematically boring. Like My Neighbor Totoro, Porco Rosso is easy on the eye, but lacks the finishing touch that might just make it a classic.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
94,Porco Rosso,8,2 November 2006,"not quite there with my absolute favorites of Miyazai, but still a rousing ride","Porco Rosso, a film by Hayao Miyazaki, tells the tale of the title character, a man who has been somehow transformed by a curse into a pig-man. Unlike in some other Miyazaki films, the curse is not largely expounded upon, and instead we're given the main course of his story. He's a bush-pilot/bounty-hunter, who is more often than not getting pulled away from sitting on the beach to fend off citizens from greedy 'air-pirates', and trying to make his own way on his own. But when his plane gets shot down, he has to build a new one. He gets the help of a plucky engineer, Fio, and soon has a new & improved plane, yet instead of the old bounties, he's now got to face off against an old rival, Curtis, for a double bet.There are certain things I can nit-pick about this film, and I would probably be looked down upon by the real die-hard fans. I didn't think that the love story side of the picture with Porco and Gina and their past rang that much as compelling or interesting, more as a typical aside to the conventionality of the picture. There were also little things I didn't care for in the final climactic battle between Porco and Curtis (mainly of the cutting back and forth between the dialog-heavy air-pirate and up in the air with the two pilots, the latter is much more fun and exciting). But even with all of this, I would still never tell someone not to check it out, especially if they're getting into Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli's world of adventurous stories in original locales. I did love the character of Porco Rosso himself, who has a little of Indiana Jones in his daring, though with an even more cynical attitude that is painted by a dark past. He's even given a not-too-shabby English voice job by Michael Keaton, and cool voice on the French audio by Jean Reno.I also loved little things about the film too even as I wasn't entirely thinking it was great. Specific shots of the plane in the air are quite incredible, with Miyazaki and his crew moving the film along in a much more cinematic manner than might be expected from usual anime; it's not your typical animated film because the director really IS directing, getting a specific vision down. And there's a wicked sense of humor about many scenes, some of which might fly over children's heads if they decide to see it (not that its unworthy for kids to see). A lot of the stuff involving the crazy, but kind in front of women, pirates who hold their big gambling ring during the climax. Or the actual pilots themselves, Porco and Curtis, when they have to fling things at each other up in the air as they run out of ammo! Little details of the animation make it lush and vibrant in places, while sort of lacking the immense surreal and bombastic pleasures of Miyazaki's other work, which isn't necessarily a bad thing here. It's a fun adventure pic with some typical situations thrown into some not so typical locales and characters. A-"
95,Porco Rosso,8,16 June 2005,one of Miyazaki's best,"I bought Porco Rosso, The Cat Returns, and Nauissica. I decided to watch Porco first. It was a great film. It had superb animation and one of my favorites. The story is about a pig named Porco Rosso, who is an aviator and a bounty hunter during post World War 1. He is basically the best pilot in the Adriatic. An American pilot named Curtis is hired by sky pirates to beat him. Porco's plane is destroyed by Curtis. Then he goes to Italy, where he gets his plane fixed. He meets Fio, who is a young girl who completely re-designs his plane. It was a great film and highly recommended to anime fans, Miyazaki fans, or people who just love imaginative stories."
