0,The Boss Baby,3,11 June 2017,A mish mash of ideas.,"I wasn't expecting a classic when I sat down to watch The Boss Baby, but I did expect to be entertained in the same way I was when watching other animated movies.Unfortunately this movie disappoints in many ways. The whole story is very complex and makes little to no sense at all. I really think the voice chosen for The Boss Baby is not correct, they should have gone for a higher pitched younger man perhaps. The movie is quite short, under 100 mins, yet for me it did drag on.The animation is colourful and up there with the best of them, but if the story is so confused then that counts for little.There were a few funny moments, so I won't give it a completely rubbish rating."
1,The Boss Baby,10,3 April 2017,Really loved this film,"I really enjoyed this film. It was imaginative, fun and just thoroughly entertaining throughout the whole time I was watching it. It had some actually genuine heartwarming moments that didn't feel manufactured like some other animated films I've seen in recent past. The animation was also just gorgeous. I really loved the look of the film, I thought it had a really nice aesthetic style and felt like a classic piece of animation that if CGI was around in the seventies, it would've looked like this. All in all, I personally loved this film. If you want something that's just plain fun, bizarre and imaginative- with a touch of warmth- I'd say check this flick out. But if you're looking for something with more of a concrete plot and a straight forward narrative, you probably won't find that here."
2,The Boss Baby,8,31 March 2017,"""The Boss Baby"" is pretty creative and a lot of fun!","I learned something important about children right after my newborn baby girl came home from the hospital. That first night, she slept like well, like a baby. My two-year-old cried like one. He was uncharacteristically restless, up and down all night, while his sister seemed perfectly content (for that first night anyway). Having a second child in the home is tough to get used to  especially for the first child. To that firstborn, it can suddenly seem like absolutely everything has changed and that the new arrival is now more important than anything or anyone else. When the new baby suddenly seems to be getting all the attention and when his or her every cry is answered immediately and every whim is catered to, that baby can seem to be the boss. It's that phenomenon, which parents with more than one child know so well, that formed the basis for a 2010 children's book by American author/illustrator Marla Frazee, and the animated feature film that the book inspired, 2017's ""The Boss Baby"" (PG, 1:37).Tim (voiced by Miles Bakshi) is a typical 7-year-old. He has an active imagination, he loves to play with his parents and he's happy. He's happy with the way everything in his life is. Right now. Today. But that all changes when his parents (Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow) step out of a taxi cab, enter the family home, and introduce Tim to his brand new baby brother. Tim quickly feels neglected. For example, his former bedtime ritual of both of his parents coming to his room to read him stories, sing him a special song and hug and kiss him goodnight turns into both of them running up and down the hall towards the baby's room and then passing out from exhaustion on the livingroom couch. But not only does Tim resent the new baby, he becomes suspicious of him. That baby doesn't seem to be acting like a regular baby. Tim thinks the little tyke isn't who he seems to be. Tim thinks that baby is up to something, and Tim is absolutely right! He catches his baby brother talking  talking in complete sentences  on a (toy) telephone! Tim confronts the baby and the baby answers him! This Boss Baby (voiced by Alec Baldwin) tells Tim that he's on an undercover mission for Baby Corp., the company which produces and distributes babies all over the world. Baby (whose actual name we don't hear until late in the movie) demands Tim's help, promising that once his job there is done, he'll leave Tim's house for good. Tim's parents work for Puppy Co, which is developing a new kind of puppy that will cut into the amount of family love available to babies more than any previous puppy model before it. With Tim's help (and the help of other babies  voiced by Conrad Vernon, Eric Bell Jr., ViviAnn Yee and David Soren  whose parents also work at the company), Baby plans to infiltrate Puppy Co, find out what they're working on, and stop the company and their CEO (Steve Buscemi) from turning any more baby love into puppy love.""The Boss Baby"" is pretty creative and a lot of fun! Screenwriter Michael McCullers (the scribe of the last two ""Austin Powers"" movies, ""Baby Mama"", ""Hotel Transylvania 3"" and ""Shrek 5"") successfully expands the premise of Frazee's novel to make it worthy of a feature film. Director Tom McGrath (helmer of the ""Madagascar"" movies and ""Megamind"") makes sure the screen is filled with colorful, imaginative and enjoyable scenes to propel this childhood adventure to its very satisfying conclusion. The talented voice cast delivers solid performances and the computer animation lives up to the high standards that Movie Fans expect from DreamWorks films. The story is a throwback to earlier styles of animated kid adventures, reminding me of ""Toy Story"" and similar older movies). The result is a film that's mostly kid-friendly (with just a little coarse language and a bunch of toilet jokes and shots of baby butts) and may even make parents feel a little nostalgic for movies from their childhoods. ""The Boss Baby"" is pretty boss  and is great fun for the whole family. ""A-"""
3,The Boss Baby,10,2 April 2017,"No spoilers, but it is the great original book-inspried animated comedy","Thus movie sends a hate message to President Donald Trump. It is also a comedy Masterpiece that is ready using the photo book in a flashback.Set in the late 1980's (As flashbacks from the photo book told it), this original movie is inspired from the 2010 book of the same book (Which is based on). The lead actor Alac Baldwin plays as the titlelar role that speaks like an adult and is actually a secret agent for BabyCorp.My favorite part is him: When he open the rocket hatch releasing ALL the Forever Puppies in Las Vegas and eventually saves his brother Tim's parents.The ending is very heartwarming and the last part sets in the style for the most parts of E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. The tail end, eventually, had the new girl born on the movie's release date of March 31st, 2017.That is one whole movie that is set the audience to play time after the movie ends."
4,The Boss Baby,,13 April 2017,Lots of fun for the whole family,"This film tells the story of a seven year old boy, who has very busy but loving parents. One day, his parents bring home a baby boy. He gets intensely jealous from sibling rivalry, until he discovers that the baby can talk and is actually working for a company. ""The Boss Baby"" is a really fun film for the whole family. The baby is super cute, and everyone will fall in love with the baby in an instant. The sibling rivalry plot is convincing, then the fantasy kicks in. The jokes are funny and family friendly. Actually everything about the film, from the plot to the characters are likable, fun and cute. I was very entertained."
5,The Boss Baby,10,10 April 2017,Great Movie,"I don't understand how this movie got so many negative reviews. I went and saw this yesterday and honestly, its one of the best movies I have EVER seen. The plot is funny and progresses intently while the characters develop and come together in common interest. This movie is absolutely hilarious and also heart warming. I 10/10 recommend this"
6,The Boss Baby,7,15 April 2017,A great movie,"I will admit that despite my initial doubts about the film, I will say that I was surprised how enjoyable the film was and having good values of family and brotherhood. The story deals with seven year old Tim who enjoys a happy life with his parents Janice and Ted. Tim's life changes when gets a baby brother who turns out can actually talk and works for a company named baby Corp which has babies with adult minds. Boss baby and Tim at first don't really like each other but come together when they realize how much they start to care for one another and attempting to foil a plot from puppy comthat wants to replace the love of babies with pets."
7,The Boss Baby,8,25 March 2017,Awesome movie!!!,"The Boss Baby is an excellent movie for kids and a great movie for families too. When I saw the trailer I REALLY wanted to see the movie and I felt like the happiest person on Earth when I saw it. The movie has funny characters, babies, and more things that would make anyone laugh. Most of all, I enjoyed the movie because of the relationships and jokes. The Boss Baby is sure to make brothers and sisters get along."
8,The Boss Baby,10,31 March 2017,"Not a masterpiece, but good entertainment with a heart","Boss Baby is not as introspectively original as Inside Out, as deep as Up, or as incisive as Wall-E.. BUT it is funny and heartwarming.Certainly it has a lot more laughs and is more engaging than Zootopia, which I thought was well-""drawn"" and had a decent story, but wasn't funny at all. I have to wonder if some of its high ratings are due to all the virtuous ""notes"" it hits with our society's current emphasis on social justice issues (not saying it's a bad thing, but I find that people give themes of diversity a lot of subjective credit that is not necessarily earned).BUT I digress.. Boss Baby has plenty of quality laugh-out-loud moments, and has humor that will appeal to kids and adults alike. There were also some very tender-hearted moments.. especially the boy's bedtime routine, it was so touching. Also the babies are way cuter than real babies (which is probably one reason I liked this film, because I'm not a big fan of actual babies)."
9,The Boss Baby,8,3 April 2017,As possibly the best Saturday Night Live flick since CONEHEADS . . .,". . . Alec Baldwin is allowed to elaborate on his spin as Donald Trump for 90 minutes during the hilarious current release, BOSS BABY. Though a few layers of subterfuge have been added here to ward off the sort of brazen and brutal political assassinations, murders, and homicides for which Trump's Puppetmaster, Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin is famous, nearly every line of BOSS BABY's first hour reeks of Baldwin's spot-on caricature of America's Game-Show-Host-in-Chief. When Big Brother Tim suggests ""We could share"" to baby terror Trump, the latter mutters ""You obviously didn't go to Business School."" Speaking of Higher Education, at 1:06:20 there's a direct reference to the fraudulent ""Trump University."" Scenes are carefully crafted at 37:15 and 1:18:55 to emphasize that the infantile current White House Occupant sports mitts much tinier than the average seven-year-old's (something easier for cartoon Alec to do than the Real Life Mr. Baldwin). At 39:50 the BOSS BABY animators slyly suggest that Mr. Trump\the title babe's male appendage is Sooooo Miniscule that it takes just one lonely pixel to completely Pixelate it. Hopefully everyone connected to this BOSS BABY satire is fully paid up on their Life Insurance."
10,The Boss Baby,10,12 April 2017,Tim a 7 year old boy helps his new brother boss baby fight the war between babies and puppies.,"Tim Templeton(the voice of Miles Bakshi) was enjoying life as a vivid imaginative 7 year old boy with his two parents Ted(Voice of Jimmy Kimmel) and Janice(Voice of Lisa Kudrow), who give him as much love as a kid could possibly ask for. However, that is until he meets the most interesting suit wearing boss baby(Voice of Alec Baldwin) brother Tim ever saw in his life. After a while, he ends up helping the boss baby go on a mission to end the war between babies and puppies. One of the things I really liked about this movie is how it had very hilarious parts to the story, but the film still had equally serious scenes in it as well. Especially, the scene where Tim and the boss baby are at the airport, and the baby says, ""I can't do this without you Tim"". Tim replies, ""Yeah, we make a pretty good team"". I also, really liked the message of the story. ""Love, comes in different shapes and sizes, but ""There is plenty of it go around"". I had nothing negative to say about The Boss Baby. I definitely recommend everyone to see it. The movie has action, love, and overall great humor in the film as well. The Boss Baby is rated PG for mild crude humor, and a movie anybody, any age will enjoy."
11,The Boss Baby,9,10 April 2017,Adorable and funny,"((Spoiler tag to be safe))First of all, whoever thought of Alec Baldwin voicing a baby deserves a reward because his performance brings so much dimension to the movie.Without spoiling anything, the animation team did well in the Boss Baby character. Even during sad/tense moments, somehow they manage to animate a very real and very much adult reaction to the baby that it really drives home that this is an adult in a baby's body. What really stood out to me was during a scene, the baby's shocked silence and body language was something that you would see in an adult, and in just those short seconds, you empathize with him.Even though a baby with an adult voice should be creepy, somehow through the perfect combination of animation style (round, cutesy and bright  this movie is brought to you by the shape circle) and the voice actors' brilliant acting, it's funny instead. It has the same slapstick humor that Dreamworks use in a lot of their animation so if that works for you, you'll love this!"
12,The Boss Baby,9,10 April 2017,a meaningful message about family,"I love the movie. It is fun and meaningful at the same time. My daughter has been always scared of having another sibling because she did not want to share her parents' love. But after the movie, she understands that ""there is enough love for everyone"". Thanks to all persons who made the movie. Such a lovely wonderful movie to watch with your family."
13,The Boss Baby,9,24 March 2017,"Fun, lighthearted with extraordinary performance from Alec Baldwin","Dreamworks' The Boss Baby, is an extraordinary, fun and lighthearted animated film based on an award-winning picture book by Marla Frazee. 7-year-old Tim (Miles Christopher Bakshi) had the perfect life and the full attention of his parents until one day, a new arrival took it all away and became the Boss of his family. Tim and Boss Baby face sibling rivalry, trying to both win the affection of their parents. Much to Tim's surprise, the two bond when they join forces to uncover the evil plot of the CEO of Puppy Co. And in the midst of it all, Tim and his new brother Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin) learn the true meaning of the love of family.The Boss Baby is fabulously directed by Tom McGrath, who you might recognize from his work on all three Madagascar movies and Megamind. He says that the movie is partially an apology letter to his own brother for all the grief he put him in when they were young.My favorite character is Boss Baby. Alec Baldwin voices this character with great panache. His witty personality mixed with a take-charge attitude bursts through the screen. I feel that Baldwin's voice talent in this is one of the key reasons this movie shines. My favorite scene is when Tim and Boss Baby work together to sneak into Puppy Co. and attempt to steal the secret file. Watching a working large scale replica of one of my favorite games when I was young (Mouse Trap) was particularly fun. Also, there are many toys from the 70s and 80s included which I enjoyed. Several times I found myself times trying to find them in the scene. There are so many magical moments throughout. As an only child, it's funny that there are times the movie made me want to have a brother and, other times, I'm happy to be an only child.The Boss Baby is an enjoyable film safe to keep you and your family thoroughly entertained. Director Tom McGrath states ""I want this movie to draw you in and make you move to the edge of your seat, not pull away from the screen"" and I believe he achieved that goal. It is rated PG for mild humor and I recommend it for ages 6 to 14, although the whole family will enjoy it. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars. It opens in theaters nationwide on March 31, 2017 so, go check it out. Reviewed by Tristan T., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
14,The Boss Baby,8,13 April 2017,Breathtaking cute!,"Pro:Cute. Con:noneSO ADORABLE. I am money worshipper (just kidding), love baby boss's expensive suit and watch, love all money throwing, and handle things with tickets.The mature voice of baby boss and his baby body full of millions of stark contrasts! Just like the little gangsta fox from Zootopia. Also the ending screen is so cute, new baby boss coming!"
15,The Boss Baby,7,1 April 2017,This Movie Is The Boss At Being Clever And Adorable,"He's cute! He has got a big head! And he is in theaters this weekend. He is the Boss Baby and his movie is the focus of this review. Hi fans, Robbie K is back again with another review, and this time on the latest animation movie to hit the silver screen. What does this animated feature film have in store? I'm happy to share some thoughts on the subject, so why don't we get started shall we? LIKES:  Good animation  Cute  Unique Twist on a story  Incredibly Fun  Funny and Clever  Movie ReferencesSummary: As you saw in the trailers, Boss Baby is another example of how incredible our animation technology is and this time it is wrapped up in a cute as a button package. This film may be one of the most adorable animation pieces to hit this year, and many will fall in love with the whimsical charm of this film. Now that we have the obvious wrapped up let us get to the real gold of this film. It's difficult to find a unique twist on a story, but the risk taken with Boss Baby's story was well executed. The tale has many layers to it involving adapting to new family members, pursuit of your dreams, and of course what is better babies or puppies. With surprising detail and character development, the story is very entertaining and fun as baby and brother try to stop the dastardly puppies from taking over. And the best part is the whole adventure is fun and fast paced, with seldom a boredom moment in this fast-moving flick. Let's hit the comedy now. Boss Baby again excels in this aspect providing a variable mix of comedic styles to entertain all ages. Young (and young at heart) will enjoy the simplistic comedy that involves the characters dropping mindless (meme-worthy) one liners, various screams of fear, and dopey run-ins with a wall. The real comedic diamonds though are the cleverer puns, one-liners, and adult references hidden in this movie. Alec Baldwin's sarcastic delivery and edginess worked for me, adding just the right touches to maximize the laughs. Yet, I'm a sucker for all the movie references integrated into this plot and how key they were to the adventure. And if you are nerd like me, you may get an extra thrill keeping your eye out for the next reference. DISLIKES:  Predictable  A bit of a stretch  A little preachy at times  More Babycorp use  Better EditingSummary: Despite how much I enjoyed the story, much of it is still predictable. Boss Baby has some surprising twists, but no manner of fun, can hide the blatantly obvious ending that is to come. While predictability is difficult to avoid, Boss Baby could have tidied things up a bit to give the finale a little more flare. In addition, they could have worked hard to not be so preachy near the end about the importance of family and all that lovey-dovey mush that animation films do all the time. Let's talk about some developmental issues I had with the movies. First off, the movie has moments that are a bit of a stretch. Yes, I know this movie is ridiculous and a stretch to begin with, but hear me out. Boss Baby's adult cast are a bit idiotic at best, somehow not hovering over the newborns to hear them speaking. If that wasn't enough, some of the more dangerous stunts involved were also not as ""noticeable"", which after some point should have been discovered. Although fun, this ridiculousness didn't fit so much into the grand scheme of the plot. Next up is Babycorp, the organization the boss baby works for. This large plot point has dramatic build up and gets a large sequence to explain the wonders of this magnificent corporation. Yet after that, the film fails to deliver more on the potential plot points that could have come with it. Had the trailers not built up the baby vs. puppy rivalry as they did, I could have let this go, but with all the advertising I would have liked to see more of this. Finally, the editing of the movie. Boss Baby has a lot of great parts that foster imagination, love, and all those positive qualities we love in an animated movie. However, much of these moments were not necessary, often just extending the run time under the guise of character development. While I don't think they needed to eliminate these parts (after all it is only 90 minutes), they certainly could have altered these scenes to be a little more relevant to the adventure. The VERDICT:Despite all the lower scores, Boss Baby was an entertaining spectacle that is fun, funny, and clever at many points. This movie is certainly adorable and is the perfect family film (for all ages) to hit the screen this year. Yes, it is simplistic and silly, and doesn't have as much magic as a Disney film, but it's nice to have unique, story that doesn't involve making a political ordeal out of it. This reviewer recommends this one for the theater for group outings and those with kids, but definitely check this one out when it hits homes. My scores are: Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5"
16,The Boss Baby,8,31 March 2017,A perfect film for young kids who don't get the idea of 'success' imposed by the adults.,"I regularly watch classics, award season dramas and thrillers on occasion. I wanted to watch an animated kids film for change, while the last animated film I saw was Bolt. I naturally don't get the 'not a Pixar film' argument about The Boss Baby. I enjoyed the film thoroughly. I felt nostalgic about my own lost childhood and the pressure of being 'grown up' and 'hired'. It's target audience are little kids, who I believed were thoroughly enjoying it in the cinema where I had been. It was fun, imaginative and very very cute. I don't understand why kids films have to face such a harsh criticism. It reflects a common adult attitude to keep kids under their control. Boss Baby is about the importance of a complete childhood, free from the constraints, superficiality, hypocrisy and faulty preconceptions of modern day success- oriented adults. 'You read stories of cannibalism? No wonder why kids are so ruined' - Tim."
17,The Boss Baby,10,7 April 2017,Made me cry at the end...,"WAS I Surprised!!! Of course with Alec Baldwin being the voice of the boss baby I knew I would love it before it even came out, not only was it what I expected but it was better! Of course it adorable, and all the silly goofy babies do, it gains your attention with the plot by making you feel for the characters. At the end I shed tears, truly heart warming. For my 2year old it's and 10/10 comedy, for myself it's a 10/10 family drama with deeply created emotions ❤️ I would even say I enjoyed the story-line much more than moana , my favorite animation of 2017"
18,The Boss Baby,2,3 July 2017,"A boring, unsubstantial and cringy film","Boss Baby, the movie which could have been a very good animated comedy lost itself in the sea of dumbness. The storyline is so bad that it won't even qualify as a dumb animated movie made for kids. The plot is clichéd with the baby in the twist, st the times when the comedic moments were to give laughter they were cringy at best. The animation is generic and some of the characters are somewhat indistinguishable from the previous dreamworks movies. It contains your regular dreamworks jokes like fart, penis jokes which aren't funny anymore."
19,The Boss Baby,2,21 June 2017,Not Dreamworks Best Work,"I don't get why all the positive reviews are shown only on the IMDb app, Unless I'm looking at the wrong place, there are no options to filter reviews like their website does. I went with peoples positive reviews on the app and took my kid niece to watch it, I realized half way through this rubbish, I should not have listened to their app, they are so biased towards positive reviews, I since deleted their app and trust in rotten tomatoes, but to put it simply, this movie doesn't deliver what it promises in the trailers. Just because DREAMWORKS name was attach to this garbage, doesn't necessarily mean it's gold. In this case, they hit bronze, I would go low as to say copper or even zinc! The story is unbelievable, the plot is everywhere, everything felt rushed and convoluted without much thought put into the story or characters. What you end up having is lots of bells and whistles but really a big pile of nothingness, with a shallow effort from the movie makers, and a dissatisfied feeling inside, all anyone wants to do is see the end credits roll up so they can get out of the theater fast! Obviously this movie was intended for pre-school children and not for everyone. Spongebob movie was a far better and entertaining movie for all ages than this load of horse manure. I would not recommend this and say to skip this one entirely."
20,The Boss Baby,10,17 April 2017,So this is how babies are born? Thrill ride for everyone! With everything anyone could ask for!,"I saw this movie yesterday, and I thought this movie was a movie where the child's imagination actually comes to life. It's a movie where you can see brother vs. brother trying to fight for their parents love and affection! Still though, it really makes me skeptical how Dreamworks say how a baby is born. It beats me to the punch-line! The jokes in this movie are really geared toward kids as well as adults. It really was so funny how everyone at Babycorp is calling management, ""Boss babies"" it made me laugh so hard!!! I couldn't stop laughing b/c it was an adorable way to explain how a baby becomes the CEO of the company!Great movie!!! It would be something I would get on DVD!!!"
21,The Boss Baby,8,6 April 2017,Hilarious and very entertaining even in a foreign language,Just watched the Boss Baby and really enjoyed it even in Brazilian Portuguese. I understood probably about 70 percent of what they were saying but a film like this is so funny and entertaining it didn't matter. The body language kept me laughing throughout and I really liked the story and plot even though they were completely ridiculous. It will be interesting to watch this film in English in the future and see if I enjoy it as much or more. Also the fact that the film only costs 7 reals which is about 2 British pounds is very good value !!!
22,The Boss Baby,10,17 April 2017,Stewie Griffin has got nothing on The Boss Baby,"Tim(Miles Christopher Bakshi) almost perfect family life is turned upside down with the arrival of a new baby brother, only to discover that he is no ordinary baby, he talks and thinks like a grown man(Alec Baldwin) and is on a mission, Tim realizes that they must work together has a team in order to get both there lives back.Best animation I've seen in a while, it takes on a life of it's own. The film never truly tugs too your heart stream to a point. The plot does not make too much sense, but that was the enjoyment of it. Alec Baldwin owned the role has The Boss Baby, his voice made the character. All the other actors do there voices quite well."
23,The Boss Baby,8,9 April 2017,One of the best cartoons I have seen,"I loved this film, saw it yesterday with my two daughters and all three of us loved and and were talking about it afterwards, even today we are telling their mother who was working about it. The scenes with the older brother were very funny. We watch quite a lot of cartoon style films as my youngest is ten. I would recommend this film to everyone, whether you have children or not. Like most cartoon movies there are subtle wording and scenes that will make adults laugh. Go out see this film, one of the best this year so far."
24,The Boss Baby,8,2 April 2017,"A predictable yet fun movie, for kids & adults alike.","The Boss Baby tells the story of Tim(Miles Bakshi) & his family. Tim's life is perfect & his Mom(Lisa Kudrow) & Dad(Jimmy Kimmel) love him very much. Soon, Tim gets a baby brother who wears a suit & carries a briefcase. He is known, simply as Boss Baby(Alec Baldwin). Tim realizes that, there is something very fishy about this Boss Baby. The Boss Baby is a great film. The animation is flawless. Watching this movie in 3D, is a must. Director Tom McGrath takes full advantage of 3D, which is a norm in all animated films now. The script by Michael McCullers based on the book by Marla Frazee, is unique. However, the second half of the movie is clichéd & goes in the direction of every other animated film, ever. The voice cast is spot on. Alec Baldwin is spectacular as Boss Baby. Steve Buscemi is great as Francis Francis. Jimmy Kimmel is awesome as Dad. Lisa Kudrow is brilliant as Mom. Tobey Maguire is amazing as Adult Tim/Narrator. Miles Bakshi is mind blowing as Tim. The Boss Baby is worth a watch, for the entire family. Go, enjoy this hilarious movie that also has a dollop of heart."
25,The Boss Baby,5,4 May 2017,Mehhhh,"Overall it is a miss. I suppose that is a little unfair of me to say. I should say the film is overrated. It does have some laughs. But I wouldn't recommend this as heavily as other animated feature films. The villain is lacking, the story is predictable, half the time the jokes fall flat and the script is meh. They should have had the baby stay a boss type and etc. Why turn a script into a plot for the Avengers when you don't have to do that? Whatever, I'm over it. Six out of ten kind of deal."
26,The Boss Baby,10,11 April 2017,Why you should watch this movie,"I loved this movie! The person who created this is so loved. I did shed a few tears somewhere near the end but this is awesome. I loved the bit where boss baby calls from the other side and asks to open the door. Quite emotional. And of course, the ending. Super sad and happy. I recommend watching this movie, and rating it a 10."
27,The Boss Baby,8,31 March 2017,I personally enjoyed it,"As the title of this review says, I personally enjoyed this movie. Was it perfect or really even great, I don't know is I would go that far. But for what it was worth ($7.50 where I am) I feel like it was worth the price of admission. There were a lot of really funny jokes that made me laugh as well as the kids that were at the movie, and that is what matters. It was a kids movie and the kids enjoyed it. While I didn't really like how there were a lot of vomit jokes and fart jokes, I really enjoyed the jokes like the baby face sun, the pacifier scene, the fight scene in the yard, and the whole just concept of Alec Baldwin playing a baby. While I don't know if I would see this multiple times, it was easily worth going to go see it once at least and there were enough good moments to make it worth the hour and a half. A solid effort for a kids flick."
28,The Boss Baby,8,31 March 2017,Cute and Creative Movie,"It is a cute and creative movie. And really the producers and writers have been in the way of making it that way.Boss Baby played by Alec Baldwin is a special and different kind of baby. Who talks and is smart. He is there sent to do something with a mission.Tim who is the 7-year old creative imaginative mind. And he is the love of his parents life until the Boss Baby comes.And the Boss Baby and Tim of course at first do not get along. But then after learning over on the Boss Baby's mission and why he was sent back to earth from where he worked for a company.Both put aside their differences and work to create the goal and plus send the Boss Baby back on his way to the company as he only has a limited amount of time or he will be a real baby.As Tim and the Boss Baby see the mission as the parents of the two boys, are also involved in the company that they work for and it is only a facade for the real setup. Meaning they must stop it in time as they feel that the pet store that the parents work for, is not all what it seems and there is a history between the villain and the Boss baby.Cute movie and very creative."
29,The Boss Baby,9,31 March 2017,Great movie for family and kids,"I rarely write review, but after seeing the score of this movie, I have to say : Damn it, it's a good movie, why do it have so many negative critics? I just watched it yesterday with my friends and laughed my ass off the entire time of the movie. It's very creative, the joke is well crafted. Some scenes are pretty emotion too. If you have kids, bring them to the cinema, they will absolutely love this. The animation is cute and funny. Some people say it's just another ""Secret life of pets"" movie. I admit ""Secret life of pets"" is bad, but the boss baby is different, the plot sometimes makes no sense but who cares! It's a movie for kids and the main thing is it funny as hell. So ignore all the haters, go check the movie yourself."
30,The Boss Baby,10,5 April 2017,Top box office,"""The Baby Boss"" movie is actually very interesting and humorous. I think that the animated babies in this film are extraordinarily cute and lovely. I personally recommend this hilarious movie for all different ages, ranging from children to adults, even old ones. You could ignore negative critics because their concept is in stark contrast to us."
31,The Boss Baby,10,9 April 2017,Great movie,"I really liked the movie, I want to say it is a great movie for kids about the age of 6, between 12. I do nit know why the movie got bad reviews, it seems like some people did not like it, the only thing I didn't like about this movie, was there were too many naked butts in the movie. But the movie was great for kids, we had fun watching it :) Strongly recommend watching Boss Baby!"
32,The Boss Baby,1,25 August 2017,Awful beyond belief. Even Bee Movie was better.,"For those viewers that think that movies like ""Minions"" or ""Sing"" appeal to the lowest common denominator, I only have to say that ""The Boss Baby"" somehow managed to lower the bar for mainstream animation to unthinkable levels.I miss the days when DreamWorks made great films like ""The Prince of Egypt."" And while some of their CGI films are definitely fun and very enjoyable to watch, ""The Boss Baby"" is definitely not one of them.Since the very first trailer, this movie seemed like a cringe-worthy experience beyond belief. The only reason of why I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt (Big mistake) was because many other animated movies tend to have awful trailers but most of them turn out to be not so bad. Some of them turn out to be actually good, but ""The Boss Baby"" turned out to be just as bad as it seemed to be in every trailer.The only positive aspect of this film was the animation style (Despite some rather questionable character designs) which was cute and reasonably well made, but sadly the visual aspect of this film wasn't enough to distract me from the awfulness of the script and its terrible jokes.Compared with this, a show like ""Rugrats"" is Shakespeare-worthy material. This might be the worst effort done by DreamWorks Animation to date, and the fact that is getting a sequel should be enough indication to explain why stuff like ""The Emoji Movie"" ends being made."
33,The Boss Baby,2,27 April 2017,'The Boss Baby:' A Disorganized and Scattered Film Unsure of Its Purpose,"""The Boss Baby"" is a 2017 20th Century Fox animated comedy based off of a book of the same name by Marla Frazee. It is directed by Tom McGrath (""Madagascar""), with a screenplay by Michael McCullers (""Baby Mama""). The music is by Hans Zimmer (""Lion King"") and Steve Mazzaro; the editing by James Ryan; and production by Ramsey Ann Naito. It stars Alec Baldwin (""30 Rock""), Steve Buscemi (""Armageddon""), Miles Bakshi, Jimmy Kimmel (""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""), Lisa Kudrow (""Friends""), and Tobey Maguire (""Spiderman""). It was announced June 12, 2014 and, after multiple incidents in which its release was delayed, was finally cinematically released March 31, 2017 (USA). ""The Boss Baby""'s budget totaled at $125 million, and internationally, it profited $366 million. It runs for 1 hour, 37 minutes (97 minutes total) and is rated PG. Now to the review:Young Tim Templeton (Miles Christopher Bakshi; adult narrator voiced by Toby Maguire) is introduced to us as a frequent dreamer; in fact, the animation style changes when the film is switching to one of his imaginings. Tim is doted one by his parents (Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow). However, things take a turn when his obviously pregnant mother announces that Tim is about to have a baby brother. We now see a baby (Alec Baldwin) exiting a sleek limo and doing some strange dance. Why, if the mother was pregnant, is the baby clearly being transported by some otherworldly means? Are the parents in the limo? And if so, why don't we see them entering the house as well? Tim quickly learns that the baby has business-like tendencies, and that he was assigned to become a ""Boss Baby"" rather than grow up like everyone else. His objective is scattered; Tim's parents, who work for a puppy manufacturer, have access to a disclosed, yet potentially earth-shattering ForeverPuppy. Boss Baby must break into the Puppy Headquarters, steal the ForeverPuppy plans, and then return them to Baby Co. If he doesn't, he will get fired, thus turned into a regular baby that will remain in Tim's life for good. Tim, who obviously wants to be rid of Boss Baby, reluctantly agrees to help on his mission IF he agrees to never enter Tim's life or family again.+ Some of the concepts are interesting; (being replaced by a younger sibling), and are lightly touched on.+ The animation, while not Disney-level, is colorful and entertaining.+ It will likely please young kids.+ There are a few funny moments.The plot does not make sense.It becomes confusing for the watcher to separate Tim's fantasies from reality.The villain is weak; and his backstory does not make sense.2/1020%F-"
34,The Boss Baby,7,1 April 2017,Fun And Entertaining,"I saw ""The Boss Baby"", starring the voices of Alec Baldwin-Rules Don't Apply, Mission:Impossible_Rouge Nation; Lisa Kudrow-The Girl on the Train, Neighbors; Jimmy Kimmel-Jimmy Kimmel Live!_tv, The Man Show; Steve Buscemi-The Ridiculous 6, The Big Lebowski and Tobey Maguire-Labor Day, Seabiscuit.This is a funny animated movie for the whole family. Jimmy and Lisa are the parents of a 7 year old child who has gotten used to having all of their attention directed towards him. Things change when a new addition to the family shows up, Alec. But, there is more to Alec than meets the eye, and it's not just in the way that he likes to wear a suit. Tobey is the narrator of the movie and also voices the adult 7 year old child, Tim. Besides the conflict of the two brothers fighting for the attention of their parents, there is a separate plot line about Steve trying to get people to be more puppy enthusiasts instead of having babies-it involves creating a new breed of puppy that never grows up. FYI: There is a scene after the end credits start and one after the very end of the credits, too, so you might want to stay. It's rated ""PG"" for some mild rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes. I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD."
35,The Boss Baby,,11 August 2017,Give into the Cuteness,"First of all, recognize that this is a children's movie. So, a completely coherent plot isn't even the icing on the cake. It's more like one extra and very beautiful icing flower on top of the icing on the cake. What I'm saying is not all kids' movies totally make sense, so don't get too mad at Boss Baby for not totally making sense.The standard movie of this ilk is littered with inconsistencies and overlooked logical flaws. In that sense, Boss Baby is a standard movie.In a much different sense, Boss Baby is far, far from standard. It's brimming with creativity and bold stylistic choices. Not everything works, but enough does to justify the attempts.The creative dynamic comes from the nature of the storytelling. The movie unfolds through the wildly inventive eyes of 7-year-old Tim. His boundless imagination makes him a questionable narrator, like Amy Dunne in Gone Girl, except he's not a psychotic murderer.At any moment, Tim can suddenly morph into a ninja (to give one example) and his perceived world morphs accordingly to fit his current fantasy. This creates a number of whimsical and forceful action sequences that will mesmerize children and should keep adults at least mildly amused.Digging a bit deeper, the movie is really about the love between brothers. Well, that and the obvious yet still funny metaphor that babies are really in charge. The brotherly moments work surprisingly well for the most part. They even elicited in me some of the intended emotions during a few key scenes when the baby realized that Tim cared for him and vice versa.Despite being completely predictable, these moments are still touching. Maybe it's the cartoon cuteness or maybe the filmmakers tactfully achieved something here. Either way, it works.Overall, I came away more satisfied than I anticipated, partly because I accepted Boss Baby for what it was. Your kids will enjoy this movie. If you relax your critical analysis, and most importantly give into the cuteness, you may enjoy it too."
36,The Boss Baby,3,2 July 2017,Too much holes in the movie,"The movie is a bit transparent with its easy predictable plot and holes. There are too many unexplained but though weird events that happened which makes it hard to watch more of it. For example: Why is the baby dressed and well delivered by a taxi? How come that the parents never found out about the true existence of the Boss Baby even though the clue's were too obvious.I know it is an animated comedy, but there are still way to many errors for an movie that had the potential to become something way better than this.Computer and editing work is great, but I just don't really like the story line and its flyblown humor."
37,The Boss Baby,10,11 April 2017,boss bebka,"Worth the stupid 5 dollars on Tuesday night, Laughed more the normal amount human should... Did not have to smoke bud to enjoy it loll Illuminate confirmed just kidding,but for real though.. maybe i don't know. good movie overall all kids welcome and don't feel weird if you see forty five yr old laughing his ass off."
38,The Boss Baby,7,23 March 2017,A pleasantly surprising romp,"Despite coming across in the trailer as a movie about babies, for babies, The Boss Baby has more than enough wry humour to entertain adults too. A lively romp of a movie, this tale of a managerial baby sent undercover feels much like an extended Looney Tunes - which is not bad thing. Plus being fast-paced has the benefit of effectively distracting from the fact that the makers haven't been quite as effective as rivals Pixar in creating an emotional core to the story (see Up and Wall-E).The Boss Baby is no animation classic, but it is surprisingly fun, not only for kids, but also adults and especially those who are parents. If you are a fan of lively animation, The Boss Baby is well worth catching; plus for once, the best bits aren't all in the trailer!"
39,The Boss Baby,1,16 May 2017,Trying to make corporate America into something cuddly,"This film scares me. It's about a really weird little baby that's mimicking adults and dreams of ""a corner office"". The day there are real capitalistic little babies in our world it's ready for the scrap heap. And the parents apparently is in marketing, which in the film is described as something wonderful. It's like the movie was specially ordered by one of the capitalist think tanks. I feel puke in my throat."
40,The Boss Baby,7,2 April 2017,Entertaining...,"""Put the cookie down! Cookies are for closers."" It seems this entire movie is created around that one joke. I mean, has there ever been any question that anyone other than Alec Baldwin could have sold the high concept of a cutthroat, suit wearing, and management oriented baby? What other voice would have struck the right balance between referentially satisfying and patently absurd? Gary Cole? Of course the film's reference to Baldwin's character in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) is twenty-five years old and at times that's how stale some of the film's gags feel. Luckily for the movie and its intended audience, the premise is grounded in its sweetly irreverent narrative told from the perspective of a seven-year-old boy.Timmy (Bakshi) is a stereotypical cartoon movie child. He's precocious, easily identifiable, humorously naïve, charismatic and imaginative to the point of coming up with elaborate hijinks on the fly to further the plot. In fact, the only difference between him and Elliott from E.T. (1982) is he actually gets all the attention he craves from his doting parents (Kimmel and Kudrow), complete with a regular five story, four hug and one song bedtime special. That is until The Boss Baby (Baldwin) arrives with his briefcase full of memos on a mission from the aptly named Baby Corp. After a time squabbling, Timmy and the Boss Baby team up to uncover a mass conspiracy involving their parents' employer, a late addition villain (Buscemi) and puppies who have apparently been stealing all the love.The inner-mechanics of Boss Baby's world is riddled with holes, pacing issues and confusion but because the entire story is being told by an adult Timmy (Maguire) recollecting his interpretation of events, it never seems to matter. It rather allows the film to truly revel in some creative slapsticky moments of goofy fun young children are primed to enjoy. There are plenty of Loony Tune-esque chase sequences, quickly-paced flights of fancy, playful sight-gags and plenty and I mean plenty of butt related jokes. It may prove a little repetitive for attentive parents but considering the prime demographic is going to be darting back and forth between bathroom-breaks it's not like parents of young children will mind.Of course telling the entire yarn from Timmy's POV proves a double-edged sword at times. The film goes through great pains to deliver the stakes needed to elevate its one-joke premise. But since the emotional arc of the story is all but written in stone from the first act, all of the tension feels hollow and redundant. We're seeing what amounts to a holiday free A Christmas Story (1983) with a talking baby. Yet while that movie ruminates on ""an interesting Christmas"" this movie asks; ""will our two heroes wind up being brothers."" Bereft of any real consequence, The Boss Baby winds up being a mildly entertaining family-oriented feature with a couple of good sigh-gags and some pretty outdated jokes. The larger message is just uncommon enough for tacit approval though I'm a little worried some kids might figure out alternative uses for baby bungee bouncers. As a younger brother myself I'm surprised I lasted this long with my siblings in the house."
41,The Boss Baby,7,2 April 2017,beyond my expectation,"This movie is much better than its score shown in film website,it deserves higher score. i decided to watch this movie in cinema since i saw its trailer online,it is quite cute and attracting trailer.But when i search it in IMDb, i found it is only 5.8? That 5.8 stop my step into cinema,and i start to find alternative movie to watch, and i found ""ghost in the shell"", and i watched its trailer, a bit embarrassing and awkward,and i can strongly feel that the movie lost the main spirit of the original animation,but i saw it has nearly 7 point in IMDb. So, i decided to ignore the score and go for the boss baby, and i am quite enjoy the boss baby,family, love,humor...i quite like it."
42,The Boss Baby,8,21 April 2017,"A cartoon, doing what cartoons do, and doing it well!","Some movies come up with a message, so do some cartoons. UP tackled the issue of loneliness, Frozen was a legit allegory for depression and how you should never leave your kid's education to trolls, and Boss Baby... well... has none. Okay, there is some kind of message, yes: don't so self-centered that you'll break the harmony of your awesome family, but that's ""standard movie message #948"" and there's no need to discuss it further. So, there is this kid, his life is all great as far as modern kid's standards go and, somehow, a supernatural, baby-shaped CEO hijacks his parents in order to pursue a secret mission which is revealed all over the trailer. The story unravels from there, completely disjointed, illogical, with the epic sort of surrealism that can sometimes emerge from the mind of a seven (and a half) year-old. That's where and why the movie really shines. Yes, there are some gross jokes here and there, but didn't we make them all when we were this age? The Boss Baby isn't an 'R' rated flick in disguise, it's a goofy, funny (not quite hilarious, but funny) story where ""Kill Bill"" minus all the snakes meets ""Tom & Jerry"", with a flurry of colors and motions as well as a quite daring art style (sometimes borrowing a tad from ""Kung-Fu Panda"" and ""Horton Hears a Who"").Technically, the animation is par with what's available these days, the score is okay, and the acting is actually good, with extra kudos for rather caricatured but very convincing facial expressions. Nothing in this movie makes sense, but nothing has to. It's refreshing, it's well paced, and it's a good way to spend a standard movie length of time. It will make you laugh on more than one occasion -if you don't take it too seriously, the flick itself doesn't, so why should you ;)"
43,The Boss Baby,6,15 April 2017,DreamWorks has always favored frivolous humor over meaningful insight,"DreamWorks has always favored frivolous humor over meaningful insight. They aren't Pixar. This isn't necessarily always a bad thing as they have had some solid hits in the recent years. Kung Fu Panda remains my favorite of the series from the studio. With The Boss Baby, their signature humor remains intact. I laughed quite often in the early stages of the film. Alec Baldwin is hilarious voicing the baby at the center, however, while I admire DreamWorks for getting ambitious with the concept of the film, it is almost so high-concept, that the core audience will be completely lost and the adults will shrug at how convoluted the many twists in the plot are. Still, The Boss Baby is frequently bouncy and frenetic and will entertain the kiddies, even if they don't get all the plot points. In the end, however, the need of the directors to pile on a thickly saccharine ending that keeps rolling on, makes the film end rather disingenuously."
44,The Boss Baby,1,25 May 2017,Boring,"The movie's trailer had painted it with an image much better than what the movie had seem to be, which i had discovered after the first 13ish minutest of the beginning of it!!I honestly have to say that I've found it to be pretty boring and disappointing, because it had much potential to be much better than that."
45,The Boss Baby,10,20 April 2017,A Masterpiece in every sense of the word,"The Boss Baby is a movie unlike anything the world has ever seen or ever will see. The story is about a baby who is supernaturally intelligent and teams up with his seven year old brother to stop the CEO of Puppy Co. I'm going to say this right now and i'm sure everyone else is too if they have any brain cells whatsoever, this movie is a masterpiece, yes that's right a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I can see in the future everyone hailing this as a classic of the ages. The two extremely talented directors Hendel Butoy and Tom McGrath have exquisitely made a true and proper film of the ages. A perfect score because it obviously deserves it in every single way, if there would be a movie i would marry it would be The Boss Baby. In fact a 10/10 seems a bit low....It really deserves much much more than just a perfect score it really deserves it's very own religion. If there was any religion I would follow it would be Thebossbabyism. The Boss Baby is of course the very best movie of all time and NEEDS to the #1 movie on the IMDb Top 250 list, The Shawshank Redemption should be kicked off and be replaced with The Boss Baby where it truly belongs"
46,The Boss Baby,6,26 April 2017,Technically good but silly story,"Yes in terms of animation, puppet characters and face expressions it is very good indeed. However this is serving a rather silly story of a supposed new baby that arrives in a taxi, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase to the home of a couple who has already a seven year old son. We soon see that the newcomer is no ordinary baby (he thinks and talks like an adult). He is a spy involved in a struggle between babies' and puppies' organizations. The relationship between the boss baby and his ""brother"" begins to be very quarrelsome but as time passes it improves a lot more friendly with the both working together in the fight for babies and against puppies. The action hasn't got anything specially original and it's somewhat tiresome to follow."
47,The Boss Baby,6,23 March 2017,"Never fully expanding on the promise of its appealing conceit, 'The Boss Baby' is typical hijinks-driven entertainment, despite boasting a pitch-perfect Alec Baldwin","Loosely based on Marla Frazee's 2010 picture book of the same name, 'The Boss Baby' pits a seven-year-old boy named Tim against his arrogant, manipulative and precocious walking-and-talking baby brother. Wait, did we say walking and talking? Oh yes, this titular infant is no ordinary baby; dubbed the Boss Baby from start to finish, he wears a suit and tie and carries a tiny briefcase wherever he goes. That's because he happens to be an ambitious management executive from the baby-making organization known as Baby Corp, whose deliberate entry into the Templetons' family is really for cover to infiltrate arch-rival company Puppyco and stop their newest invention  the ne'er-grow-old 'Forever Puppy'  that threatens to further divert humans' affection (presumed to be finite) away from babies. If all that sounds a little far-fetched, you're absolutely right; in fact, these events are happening inside the mind of a wildly imaginative only child, who concocts this elaborate scenario as an analogy of how his newborn sibling is usurping the time, attention and love of his parents.Because most of it happens inside Tim's head (who narrates the story as an adult voiced by Tobery Maguire), director Tom McGrath (co- director of the three 'Madagascar' movies) and screenwriter Michael McCullers (Mike Myers' co-writer on the second and third 'Austin Powers' movies) get plenty of leeway to let their own imagination run wild. That includes conceiving conception as coming off an assembly line, where babies are diapered, powdered and sorted into 'Family' or 'Management' depending on how they respond to stimuli. That also involves throwing corporate politics into the mix, where the Boss Baby's mission success decides whether he gets promoted to CEO, upgrades to a huge office of his own complete with a private toilet, and joins the ranks of his idol 'Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby'. And last but not least, that culminates in the foiling of a dastardly plot hatched by Puppyco's CEO, Francis E. Francis (Steve Buscemi), to flood every corner of the world with his 'Forever Puppys' packed into a rocket ready for launch.The late introduction of Francis E. Francis shifts the proceedings into hyperdrive, and like 'Penguins of Madagascar' or 'The Croods', delivering loud frenetic action becomes the priority in the third and final act. From the point Tim and the Boss Baby sneak into Puppyco's company headquarters on 'Bring Your Kids to Work' Day, it is one non-stop action sequence after another as the unlikely duo evade Francis' henchman within their suburban neighbourhood en route to the airport, smuggle on board a plane full of Elvis impersonators bound for Vegas, and stop the rocket countdown from a Vegas convention centre before the 'Forever Puppies' overrun the globe. All that feverish to-and-fro comes at the expense of heart, humour or even neglecting the simple truth behind all that fantasy, i.e. that Tim's just plain terrified that he is being replaced  and that not even a supposedly heartwarming resolution that has Tim finally embrace his baby brother and the latter 'family-hood' can compensate for.In fact, it is the earlier two  and much simpler  acts that have much more meaning and laughs. An earlier sequence that pits Tim against the Boss Baby and his other Baby Corp spies in the vicinity to the theme music from that 70s TV show 'S.W.A.T.' is a lot more entertaining and inventive than the concluding melee. Even more inspired is that which introduces us to Baby Corp, centred not just on a revisionist explanation of where babies come from but also why the Boss Baby was not like most of the others bound for domestication from the beginning. There are other amusing touches of wit  such as how the Boss Baby gives a virtual tour of Baby Corp by asking Tim to suck aggressively on a special pacifier or how the Boss Baby delivers himself to the Templetons by taxi and funk waddling up the doorstep or even Tim's daily escapist adventures that turn dinner into a hunt through the Congo, daily baths into an undersea mission to save his parents from inside the jaws of a shark and his alarm clock into a Gandalf wizard wannabe named Wizzy.But a big reason for the Boss Baby's sheer hilarity is none other than Alec Baldwin's flawless voice delivery, this being the fifth time he's lending his signature deadpan to an animated movie. Perfectly capturing the eponymous character's infantilism, brashness, egotism, insecurity and affection, Baldwin brings the man-child to vivid life, nailing the punchlines and even elevating some of the less clever puns. Indeed, it is hardly a stretch to say that Baldwin is the film's standout element, its primary source of cheer, exuberance and wackiness, and quite simply the one reason that makes it worth catching.The basic premise of 'The Boss Baby' is undeniably an appealing and relatable one: the anxiety, uncertainty and even fear that a child faces when he is no longer the only kid in the family, especially given the demands and concessions that a newborn places on his or her parents' time. Turning that into a vivid fantasy with the newborn becoming a literal 'boss' not just of the family but also of an entire baby-making operation that views puppies as their number one enemy sounds ingenious, but the execution through hijinks-driven slapstick gags ultimately reduces it to generic hyperactive fare that too many animated comedies these days are guilty of. And by that same measure, 'The Boss Baby' has little distinction from the average cartoon, despite being admittedly beautifully visualized, cheerfully executed and boasting the top-notch voice talent of Alec Baldwin. It may be about a baby all right, but that hardly excuses why it has to resort to the attention span of one."
48,The Boss Baby,1,15 July 2017,Story writers must be confused while writing the story.,"One of the dumbest movies I've ever watched. I know this a kid's movie, but it shouldn't have been this dumb. Their is no plot in the movie. Apparently, puppies are manufactured, and a company named 'BabyCorp', which employees infants, wants to destroy the company so that babies get all the love. I mean wtf. Movie was really weird, even for kids, my cousin, who's 7, hated it. I am sure that the story writers were high on weed while writing the story. The plot keeps contradicting itself. Would have given 0 stars if possible."
49,The Boss Baby,1,24 June 2017,"No spoilers, just a warning",I will down-vote every movie that normalizes violence against male genitalia (in this case the young boys').I never saw an animated Hollywood movie that made fun of or considered it appropriate for a family movie to show how women or girls are kicked between their legs.Typical anti-male Hollywood trash.
50,The Boss Baby,6,2 April 2017,"What the world needs now is love, sweet love...I did like Boss Baby","I saw this move with three children, 8, 7 and 3 years of age. They all wanted to see this movie rather than watch 'Beauty and the Beast'. When given the option, it was a uniform cry of ""boss baby, boss baby"". So off I went. I thought it would be awful. There were single male and female adults of all ages in the audience, as well as parents with children. My 3 year old laughed a lot in the beginning saying ""boss baby is funny"". After that, she got a bit lost and restless, but got settled again in the second half. The others were focused throughout and said they liked it more than than the 'trolls movie'.I laughed a lot. The reference to other movies and adult themes was very clever and funny (ie Matrix, Elvis impersonators, etc). The Boss baby character is hilarious. I loved the reflections on parenthood, feeding the baby, dummy sucking, milk bottles, diapers (nappies), vomit, lack of sleep, etc. Sibling competition for parental attention is demonstrated well. The new baby is always the 'boss baby' in any family! The story made me wonder- was it all the child's imagination? The ending was heartwarming and overall, this movie was a nice surprise."
51,The Boss Baby,6,1 April 2017,"Simple generic animation, but I really like how the story was told.","When I first herd about The Boss Baby I did not think I would like it, despite the trailer showing me just how funny Alec Baldwin was going to be in it. It just did not sound like the best animated feature Dreamworks could possibly do, but as it turns out, Boss Baby is real enjoyable, mostly because of the story over the animation. Baldwin plays The Boss Baby, a middle management exec for Babycorp (That delivers babies to the world), sent undercover as Tim's brand new baby brother, in an attempt to stop puppies from cornering the market on cute, (Which has decrease the production of infants) by stopping the manufacturing of the ultimate Puppy.What's so good about The Boss Baby is how they work it in that the purpose of the film is Tim using his imagination to adjust to a new baby coming into the house that he once alone had the love and attention of both parents all to himself. A very uniquely done animated film, if not the best animated film. Just a great children story on children. Reminds me of Pixar's Inside Out.Very funny and entertaining.http://cinemagardens.com"
52,The Boss Baby,6,9 April 2017,Not as Bad as I Thought But Still Not the Best DreamWorks Film Out There,"After I saw the trailers, I knew this would be the Rugrats/Baby Geniuses and Look Who's Talking movie from DreamWorks despite being based off a book, I went In expecting It to be average AND......I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.It's not Trolls level of Unnecessary and way too hip and modern, the film plays like a Disney cartoon from the 50s and 60s, the way the animation looks, the setting of this movie, the music and the plot, It feels like a cartoon but turned Into a movie, with that said I actually liked the movie and what It offered.The animation has that Storks look (despite the Idea being similar to that movie), It has a cute look to It, while It does have different styles when Tim goes Into his Imagination worlds where he's a pirate, explorer Etc, It makes It relate able and Interesting and even the moral (which I won't give away but I think anyone can guess what It Is) can relate to most kids who watch this movie, sure the movie makes no sense and It's very cartoon, but It does have a good moral.The characters are pretty fun and well voice acted, Alec Baldwin Is great as the title character, the kid who voices kid Is pretty great too, but the rest of the characters are pretty funny too.But the movie does suffer from a simple but predicable plot, pretty obvious toilet, fart humor, It does have adult humor but It does comes off as obvious as well despite being funny.So yeah, the movie's...an improvement from Trolls, It's on par with Home In the pretty good category, but It's not the best from DreamWorks, hopefully Captain Underpants will Improve from this movie.I'm giving Boss Baby a 6/10."
53,The Boss Baby,6,31 March 2017,Animated Science Fiction,"New concept with animation. Once again there is scientific corporation with a plot and there is a secret formula and highly upgraded child calming device with multi functions. We get to see lots of employees, supervisors and Board of Directors. Highly organized graphics, with sharp shapes and colors and objects of our everyday life and surrounding. Nerdy parents but cool kids. Somethings might become realistic in the future considering the direction of current preferences, culture and politics of the world. The story line has a manifesto which runs through out the movie and it is easy to follow since the movie is based upon a BOOK. Do not read the picture book first. A must see movie for kids and parents so they can share different views without obstructing. Verbally interacting and visually enterprising. Great entertainment for all ages. A new way of thinking that is certain to become the main line thought in the future. Not even for a moment I find this fiction a characterization of sibling rivalry.There is definitely a big competition between two things we all care about. Do you want to find out for yourselves what is it ?"
54,The Boss Baby,10,22 April 2017,I actually enjoyed this movie...,"I thought this movie was pretty funny (as an adult). I also have a pretty comical and maybe childish sense of humor! I don't think my 5-year-old would be totally into this, BUT I was! :) I'm assuming some people thought the jokes were expected or not original, but this is the first animated film that I truly enjoyed and had a great laugh. I went into this not expecting a full on child's film and wasn't let down!"
55,The Boss Baby,1,31 May 2017,What is so funny about this movie??????,"Boring and violent for kids. I cannot recommend a film that green lights violence against boys. When did kicking a boy in the groin (that could kill him) become funny? Is punching a woman in the breasts hilarious? This disgusting example of violence to males is teaching a new generation of children that a groin kick that can kill a boy is hysterically funny. So why do they preach you never, ever hit a woman - another shining example of Hollywood's sexist hypocrisy. Garbage film, Bad script. Alec Baldwin of all people should know better than participate in this kind of male bashing."
56,The Boss Baby,5,4 May 2017,A decent kids' movie but nothing more.,"'THE BOSS BABY': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A computer-animated kids' flick, based on the 2010 picture book, of the same name, by Marla Frazee. It tells the story of a seven-year- old boy that's introduced to a new baby brother, only to learn that the baby is a secret agent, voiced by Alec Baldwin, that's leading a war against puppies. It costars the voices of Miles Christopher Bakshi, Tobey Maguire, Steve Buscemi, Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow. The film was directed by Tom McGrath (who also co-directed the first three 'MADAGASCAR' movies) and it was scripted by Michael McCullers (who also co-scripted two 'AUSTIN POWERS' movies, and wrote and directed 'BABY MAMA'). It's gotten mixed reviews from critics, but it's also a huge hit at the Box Office. I found it to be about average for a silly animated kids' movie.Timothy Templeton, as an adult (Maguire), tells a story about when he was seven-years-old (Bakshi) and first introduced to his baby brother (Baldwin). Tim is immediately jealous of all the attention his new brother steals away from him. He's also suspicious of some really strange activity; like the fact that the baby wears a suit and carries a briefcase. He later learns that his brother is trying to lead a war against puppies, with the other babies in town. Tim tries to convince his parents (Kimmel and Kudrow) this, but they're convinced he just has a very active imagination (which he obviously does).The movie is creative and somewhat imaginative, and I like the way the filmmakers tell it's story. Right away I got the sense that it's all symbolism for how a child deals with accepting a new baby brother. You of course have to watch it all the way till the end though, to know for sure. The jokes are all aimed at kids unfortunately though, and they're all extremely silly. So other than the creative storytelling, the movie doesn't have a lot to offer adults. Which is fine, it's still a decent kids' movie but nothing more.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/K3Maw4akm_o"
57,The Boss Baby,8,26 April 2017,"Imaginative, funny, touching","""The Boss Baby"" turned out to be one of my favorite animated films in recent memory, far better than the preview trailer had me thinking it might be. What impressed me most were the fantasy and action set pieces that move the plot forward, which were far more imaginative, colorful, and clever (and plentiful) than I expected. The trailers I had seen prior to the film's opening had me thinking it would be a one-joke film, but it turned out the film's creators had a lot more imaginative plot ideas up their sleeve and I'm grateful they didn't give most of them away in the pre-opening advertising--it was a delight to discover just how over-the-top the film goes in its visuals and creativity as the film unfolded (even from the very first scenes of babies arriving from where they're ""made."") Alec Baldwin was the perfect choice for the lead character's voice: his work on ""30 Rock,"" and even on the current ""Match Game"" game show as host (not to mention his kidding, 'wink-wink', you're in-on-the-joke amusing appearances on talk shows over the years) revealed long ago that he has the perfect voice for comedy voice-over work. He knows how to kid around, be silly, and have fun (and poke fun) in real life, and it brings ""the boss baby"" to life in very funny ways in the film."
58,The Boss Baby,2,31 March 2017,A Fresh Diaper of Ideas That Needs to Be Changed,"Anyone with younger siblings out there? Pop quiz: When you saw your new little brother or sister arrive into the family, what was your immediate reaction? Were you afraid he or she might detract your attention from mom and dad? Did you anticipate you would somehow have to love this factory of poopy diapers? Is it even worth it to have a sibling after all?DreamWorks' newest feature The Boss Baby, based on the children's book by Marla Frazee, explores those concepts for all of twenty minutes, then fills in the remaining run time with the usual tasteless humor and adult references expected by the studio made famous by Shrek. While the supporting cast gives somewhat decent voice performances, nothing else of memorable interest defines their characters. The whole focus lands on the one big star on the poster. ​ After recent critical praise on SNL, Alec Baldwin (30 Rock, The Cooler) now makes his second portrayal of our current blonde, small- handed president in a form for the kiddos. He tells his whole story to us, where he came from, how he got here, and why. You see, a corporation exists out in the heavens called ""Baby Corp,"" a business composed of babies. No reason going into where they came from, or the intent of their mission statement, you're not supposed to think too hard about it. Why? Because make-believe, duh!Baby Corp's workers go across a machine that powders their butts, applies their diapers, and categorizes them based on how ticklish they are. If they're ticklish, they are sent to a couple's doorstep. If not, they are sent to managementan enormous office setting built out of baby supplies such as crayons on their desk. Now no more pressure in explaining to your kids where babies come from! DreamWorks' masterpiece will make them believe their lie, no problem! Then they'll stop asking you about it and you two can go back to your happy time in the bedroom!Anyway, the one resembling a miniature Trump gets sent to management, then from there to the doorstep to lead a mission against their ultimate enemy: puppies! Specifically, he has his motives set on stopping the new brand by Puppy Co., the ""Forever Puppy,"" an immortal infinitely young dog breed. Yet he needs the assistance of the family's seven-year-old son. Yes, I know. Riveting, isn't it? Well, maybe so if you were the same age as the two leading kids. Then again if the demographic targets families of kids all ages, why does it include baby powder farts, a censor block over the infant's privates, pant zipper music, and a doggie inflatable bouncy house with an exit through its anus? There are also subtle signs of mistreatment towards puppies: they are seen hanging from balloons at a convention, as if animal cruelty laws don't apply. Obviously, the makers of this fast-paced childish noise don't care about growing up, just painting adults as the villains of a boy's elaborate imagination where he has to lie to solve his problems. Judging by what we see on Fox News, I say we need some adulthood, and such movies are not helping today's kids grow up!The main child, Tim, offers a particularly damaging mindset for kids to look through, as virtually everything he sees is filtered through his rainbow-tinted glasses. Even if the fantasies' altered 2-D style of animation look fun and stylistic, the concept of his talking baby brother back in the 3-D animation style would suggestively reflect how he feels about having a new sibling, which many narrative points blaringly contradict. Plus, a one point, they're at an airport together, and not one adult notices the unaccompanied minors. I'm sorry, the concept sounds funny and all, but I can't buy into it until it decides what to be.The Boss Baby is not the type of entertainment you sit down and enjoy together, but rather the type of brash noise used to calm your child's temper tantrums for a measly hour and a half so you two can enjoy some peace and quiet by yourselves for once. You can count on time getting wasted both in the theater and at home with this heap, so you're better off using Disney or Pixar to divert your kid's attention, or even using these modes of entertainment as experiences for the parents and children to enjoy together. Anything to get you away from a miniature Alec Baldwin barfing on screen works just fine."
59,The Boss Baby,7,22 April 2017,"I'm sorry ""Boss Baby""...you're actually a good movie.","I feel like I should apologize to ""Boss Baby""...I went into this movie under the preconceived notion that this was going to be bad. I saw a couple trailers and immediately was not sold. Judging from the marketing I didn't find it humorous with too many pandering fart jokes and ""baby cuteness"" fluff, I didn't like the style as it looked fairly generic, and the story seemed uninspired...cut to an hour and twenty minutes later, I can honestly say I was very wrong about this movie and I should know better than to judge a book by its cover...or a movie by its trailer. The comedy was pretty funny for the most part, aside from the few times it did fell short. The art direction was terrific and truly gorgeous to watch, drawing from the same vein as a lot of older ""Warner Bros."" cartoons. Lastly, the story has so much more creativity and to it than I would have ever expected from a movie titled ""Boss Baby"". To give a brief summary of the plot; the movie is about a young boy who recently receives a baby brother and from there learns to come to terms with the new addition to the family through his imagination creating over-the-top scenarios and stories that they find themselves in. From that perspective, seeing this movie approximately 90% as an insight into the imagination of a seven year old boy, the film works. If someone were to take this film's story literally happening all the way through then it will leave a bad taste and a huge amount of confusion. From the start, however, the movie does establish that the young boy (Tim) has a highly active imagination and it is believable that he would come up with such extreme anecdotes that he puts himself in. In that regard, I found this to be a very enjoyable sit. That being said, it's far from perfect. There are times where the comedy does fall a little flat with pandering fart and puke jokes or just simply having the gimmick of there being babies on screen being serious. Also, in the final act of the movie it was becoming exceedingly difficult to figure out where reality ended and imagination began within the plot. There was so much playing around with the ludicrous nature of the premise that the story began to lose focus as to how much is actually happening in the real world and what is made up in Tim's mind. So the third act doesn't quite hold up if you think about it too much, which my advice is to not think about it too much. Leave your brain at the entrance and just kind of let the movie happen, if you do that you should have a decent time with this. Especially if you have children, since this movie is so fast paced it should keep the attention of the entire family and make it a quick sit.If you give this movie a real chance and not try to think too much about the logistics of everything happening on screen then you will find a relatively sweet little movie about a boy imagining some wacky adventures that he has with his baby brother in order to come to grips with not being the center of attention of his parents anymore, but rather a full family. There will be some laughs, some cuteness sprinkled in, pretty imagery, good animation, entertaining action, and a little bit of heart as well. This is nowhere near as bad as the trailers made this movie out to be, so if you have little ones then this is actually a good one to show them. It's not insulting or the cash-grab movie it could have been, there was a lot more thought put into this movie and I think it may actually teach kids something about gaining a little brother or sister."
60,The Boss Baby,6,3 April 2017,A silly funny animated comedy from the man that brought you Megamind,"The Boss Baby is the latest Dreamworks Animated feature and stars Alec Baldwin(Rise Of The Guardians),Tobey Maguire(Spiderman),Lisa Kudrow(Friends)and Jimmy Kimmel(TV host of Jimmy Kimmel Show)and tells the tale of a 7 year old boy named Tim(voiced in adult form by Tobey Maguire)who has a vivid imagination. His an only child and both his parents(voiced by Kudrow and Kimmel)are over a company called Puppy Co,where they are big in selling puppies. Meanwhile during the opening credits of this film we see a bunch of babies who are being sent to our world. Some go to Management,others go to Families. One baby in particular ends up in Management and is sent on a mission to find out about Puppy Co who is owned by a well off businessman(voiced by Steven Bushchei)and is trying to take over the world. So the baby ends up with Tim's parents,but Tim thinks the baby is weird because he wears a business suit,is extremely bossy and behaves like an adult. Turns out Tim is right as the baby IS able to talk and act like a human(voiced by Alec Baldwin)and is dubbed The Boss Baby. He explains to Tim that he was sent here for Puppy Co(as I have mentioned)and needs Tim's help to try and stop the wealthy businessman who is trying to get rid of all babies so that adults can buy puppies instead. But will The Boss Baby ever become an ordinary baby and dispose of his magical drinking formula that makes him behave like an adult.Now I know what you are thinking the premise is stupid,and your right the premise to this film is stupid but let me tell you, I actually thought it was a funny film. Alec Baldwin was hilarious as the baby who can talk like an adult and behave like an adult,there were certain scenes that had me and my family laughing. The story has been done before think of it as Baby Geniuses(but not as bad as that)and Stewie from Family Guy and you pretty much get The Boss Baby. The animation is very nice and everything else was fine.If you got kids and they wanna watch a fun cartoon then take them to see it I am sure they will love it. As for me I liked it too,yes I wasn't the target audience for this film but still as a lover for animation and I am in my late 20s I say go and watch it. 3.5/5"
61,The Boss Baby,4,29 April 2017,Predictable (Not in a good way.),"I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, seeing from the trailers I knew it was going to be another cliché Dreamworks film. Not cliché as in 'it's been done before' (Though this obviously isn't the first instance of a child acting like an adult for humor) Cliché as in formulaic, the kid (Tim) having the same issues of the fear of being forgotten or abandoned (Toy Story, Inside Out) Even before the Boss Baby was introduced, it was pretty obvious how it was going to play out. The kid has an overactive imagination, he imagines the baby is taking over his home life, and it resolves with the baby acting like a normal baby. And that's exactly what happens, albeit in a more complicated way, but in a nutshell. The only redeeming thing from this movie were the visuals, more specifically at the beginning when Tim was playing make believe, it felt cartoony and alive. The whole movie felt animated, which is always nice to see in a kids movie. For the most part, a majority of the scenes always had nice atmospheres and color theory at play. The main characters, however, look pretty generic and uninteresting. The humor in the movie falls flat, but that's subjective. The movie theater I was in (Which was pretty barren) didn't seem all that interested in the movie, either. I only heard people laugh at TWO scenes, out of the entire movie. I guess if you throw garbage at a wall, somethings bound to stick. Speaking of humor, some of the jokes in the film were a bit out of place and just awkward in general. The climax of the film was okay, it didn't stray too far from the ridiculousness of the film's tone. Nothing really stood out visually, and the apparent attempt at a tear-jerking scene was a bit stale, since they'd already established the whole 'business babies never had families'Overall, good until the moment the Boss Baby actually shows up."
62,The Boss Baby,6,24 April 2017,This baby's a nice surprise,"Here's another shining example of marketing gone wrong. That ""cookies are for closers"" line that was in all of the trailers for ""The Boss Baby"" made it seem like an obnoxious kids movie, especially one that shamelessly mines one of Baldwin's greatest lines for cheap laughs. I dreaded this movie for that very reason, and the line (as delivered) actually comes off rather organically. It's no big deal at all. I liked this movie more than I thought I would, that's for certain. Despite the character designs (those dilated pupils get old quick) and a sticky-sweet ending, the theme of first-born displacement is pretty touching. And the LSD-inspired humor in a baby's love for its binky was surprisingly inventive; also surprising is the comedic value in a wizard alarm clock. Seriously, the laughs come when you least expect them. 6/10"
63,The Boss Baby,1,31 May 2017,In one word? Disappointment !,"I really had some expectations to enjoy this movie and I really tried hard to enjoy it so I had patience but I think after 40-45 minutes I understood how awful, childish, boring and without any potential that movie. Something in that movie just didn't work for me! A very superficial plot, BORING, not to mention that wasn't amusing or funny. I understand how the film expresses the rich imagination of a small child who needs exclusive attention from his parents and is jealous when a new baby arrives in the family... and yeah, the twist here is when it's not a regular baby. OK. BUT: couldn't they just done it INTERESTING?! AMUSING?! I've turned it off after 45 minutes !!! I just was so disappointed and mostly bored!!! I felt like I'm in the kinder garden babysitting a group of little ones and i felt i just forcing myself to watch that stupid childish plot and forcing my self-enjoying it which i totally DIDN'T! OMG... what the producers thought to them selves? Did they had the attention to amuse all the family or just babies? Little kids? I'm not sure... It doesn't happen me a lot that I'm turning off a movie after a few minutes of watching... and when it does happen I'm so pieced off! From my experience, such kind of films are expected to be amusing and entertaining for the whole family and it seems as if the producers were only concerned with pointing to the audience of small children  which is not fair at all! There are these channels of toddlers where all sorts of programs are specially designed for them, for preschoolers, and that's exactly how it felt to me. As if I were babysitting my nephew and watching with him that channel. Something here missed this film, something that does not appeal to an older audience who also wants to enjoy a comedy film. Very childish and naive elements exist in that film. I don't think I was too much tired when I watch it, I just was feeling BORED from it. DreamWorks hey, you just have to admit it: this time it just didn't work for you. You had better films and really enjoying. I'm not surprised why it received such a low score on the IMDb website. You know there's this moment in the show when you watch it that you're telling to yourself: ""ok what am I doing?! Why am I wasting my time of that?"" that was exactly the feeling. I wouldn't be surprised that I would really enjoy it if for example I would have been 6-10 years old but not when I'm 33! I felt like the screenwriters weren't creative, weren't witty. A shallow plot that shows how the child of the family has an interest in receiving the exclusive and loving attention of his parents and the special baby has another interest (I will not be a spoiler) and for the sake of the matter they cooperate together. Perhaps the idea of this is cute but they could done it amusing, again, to the whole family and not just to small children! When creating films of this kind you have to think about how everyone can enjoy and not just a specific target audience because that's how it felt the whole movie: only my nephews were sure to enjoy it. Only the friends of my nephews from kindergarten. A movie that is very suitable for the toddler channel on television. There is a very embarrassing feeling for the adult viewer watching this film. An embarrassing feeling of childishness that is unpleasant. A feeling that is shameful and very strange, losing interest after a few minutes of watching. A certain understanding that this is a film that will be suitable only for young children. My expectation was so different! It seems that this time DREAMWORKS decided that they were more likely to pamper the audience of the little kids than adults, or that the scriptwriter or scriptwriters of the film missed that many adults like to watch animated films. What did they think to themselves? That if in the plot there will be a baby who is an adult then this is it? Is this a movie directed at the whole family? The fact is that it did not work on me. On the contrary - I was most disappointed! What still disturbed me is the movie's trailer: a comic film, supposedly fun for the whole family, a sweeping plot, fascinating, amusing, funny but actually - getting the most childish film, boring, no interest, without any enthusiasm. I think the film simply appeals to a target audience of young children to educate them about something called ""sharing."" To pay attention, to love, to play, to have a good relationship and to teach not to be selfish, possessive, to know that sibling relationships are very important. Maybe that's why I lost interest and I would not be surprised if other adults watching the movie felt the same way. Simply lack of interest or enthusiasm. I really hope that the producers, screenwriters and anyone who worked on the plot and the film will read the negative reviews on this site so that they will learn lessons and know for the future that if they want to create more animated films, they will know a much wider target audience and not take this approach knowingly or not. It is good that such a site exists to give honest opinions about films and series. The film industry needs to maintain a professional line of permanent entertainment for its customers. Unfortunately, anyone who asks me about the film will I'll give him my honest and negative opinion. And so, I say to everyone: ""If you have a little boy, he'll enjoy it. are you? Definitely not!"" Too bad. A potential plot that could have been much more fascinating, interesting, entertaining and amusing for the whole family. Not just for toddlers."
64,The Boss Baby,1,23 July 2017,"This movie defines ""Bad"".","This movie is not worth a long review. Just avoid it. Can't give it a 0 ... I respect the people who like it but personally i found it extremely bad. Unfortunately i need 5 lines of text so here it goes : saw about 15-20 minutes of it; storyline is incredibly bad. It seems to be related to the normal ""initial resistance"" that a big brother has to the new baby in the house ... but the way it does it is bad. Not funny. Maybe it gets better after half an hour, i don't know - didn't have the stomach to waste my time with it."
65,The Boss Baby,3,29 June 2017,One of the worst animated films i have ever seen in my life,"OK looking at the cover and the animation alone it looks alright. The animation was admittedly good and voice acting was OK as well. Its just the actual PLOT and unfunny JOKES the film is constantly shoving straight into your face. The film can't go literally 2 minutes with out making one unfunny joke. If you've seen the also terrible ""Baby Geniuses"" you've pretty much seen this only this version is animated. I personally HATE this movie not only for being complete garbage, but for also becoming a youtube trend with Cringey children like Durv making videos saying he ""called"" the Boss Baby. Movies like these make me wonder how much more autistic America is becoming despite me being an American."
66,The Boss Baby,8,24 April 2017,A Pleasant Surprise,"DreamWorks' latest animated feature ""The Boss Baby"" could have easily been just another animated movie to pass the time, but surprisingly it had much more to it than you'd think. The film playfully puts you into the perspective of the main character Tim, as he deals with his newborn sibling literally invading his life. There's a fantastic overall lesson that teaches younger audiences (especially those who are the eldest) of the importance of loving their younger sibling, which I haven't seen many films of this genre do. Speaking of perspective, there are these brilliantly animated ""imagination"" sequences that not only entertain, but help older viewers be put into a place of childhood so you can better relate to Tim's character. Details and concepts like that are never wasted in this film, which brought originality to an otherwise cliché storyline. Though it suffers from the usual DreamWorks problems in regards to certain jokes and scenes, it ended up not being an overall waste of time."
67,The Boss Baby,5,28 March 2017,"A Sunday afternoon movie with the whole family, seriously...I ain't joking","The Boss Baby. Hmm, where can I begin with to say about this movie? One thing that's for sure; after I left the theater I don't think the movie is worth remembering as those other boisterous animation movies such as the colorful Inside Out or the legendary Toy Story trilogy.It has been somewhat a major issue that this movie is discriminated by a few people who think that it could lower down one's IQ due to the ridiculous concept; a talking baby who acts like he's the boss. Well, judging by the trailer, I could partially agree with the things mocked by them. Despite that, let's talk about the whole movie. Yes, this movie has a bizarre plot; producing babies in a factory machine. But there are legitimately pretty good things in The Boss Baby. First and foremost; this movie is so hilarious. Watching it with your kids or friends can make you giggle and be heard by the audience in front of you. That standard giggling is mutual as when someone is tickling you at your right spot. Even tough audiences will at least smile and think about the sweetness this movie has.I'll admit that I could barely relate with the baby on the first act of the movie. It doesn't really give him adequate space to introduce himself but it gets along pretty well the second and third acts. It will gradually pick up its pace towards the main plot and the questions of who? why? what? etc etc. are answered when near the climax scene.The Baby reminisced me and also maybe some of you on the principal of the school located up in the air in the movie Sky High. Yeah, the one with the gigantic bald head.Let's wander around the dark area; the arts of animation aren't that impressive. You'll be wondering if they actually wanted to do the old-school style of animations or the director claimed to make a difference compared to the ones we see nowadays. The characters look as if there were very simple and soft-skinned but no enticing factor unlike Frozen or Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs. Talk about the backgrounds; the vividness of the complexity that tried to copy Fantastic Mr. Fox or the live-drama movie, The Grand Budapest Hotel failed drastically. The backgrounds can't connect with the simplistic main stage where characters are arguing or fighting against one another.The plot seems bizarre as I have said earlier but that doesn't end there, the plot too has a very confusing story for the youngsters to understand and reveal the suspense or how the movie works altogether. It's definitely better than the jokes-are-not-working Storks or the Free Birds that tried hard to be as the same standard as Chicken Run.A solid 47/100. :)"
68,The Boss Baby,6,12 April 2017,"Cookies are for winners, but this movie is not quite a winner. At least, it's not a stinky diaper. It was mostly fine.","I know, that some of you, will shake your rattle at me, because you really wanted me to hate on this movie, but don't be a big baby! The movie wasn't that bad. It deal with relatable real world issues, but through the lens of a wildly colorful and cartoonish fantasy. The animation from DreamWorks was amazing. The voice acting is wonderful and the music score by composter, Hans Zimmler & Steve Mazzaro was beautiful. It was mostly a well-rounded movie. Directed by Tom McGrath, and loosely based on a picture book of the same name by Marla Frazee. The film tells the story a young boy, Tim (Voiced by Miles Bakshi) having his life turned upside down, when his parents, Ted (Voiced by Jimmy Kimmel) & Janice (Voiced by Lisa Kudrow) decide to have a baby (Voiced by Alex Baldwin) who happens to wears a suit and carries a briefcase around. Without spoiling the movie, too much, for the most part, I like how the movie address the issues of sibling rivalry when it comes to the control of the love, from the parent & how much attention is demanded from a new born, however, I did think the film went a little too dark, in certain scenes. Seeing a kid go through a psychological breakdown, and try to kill a baby to win back, his parents seem a bit much. It was somewhat hard to watch, along with some slapstick confrontations between babies and adults. While, most of it is played for laughs. The nick-of-time peril might be, too much for younger viewers. The same, can be said with the mean-spirited cutthroat white collar corporation jokes that the film was going for. The unlikeable prideful tone of Alec Baldwin's imperious sounding voice does get old, pretty quick. However, I have to say, I'm glad, the movie isn't as obnoxious as the trailer, makes it out to be. Don't get me wrong, the 'Boss Baby' is still annoying and disturbing with how insults, the film uses; but there seem to be, some heart to the film as well. I like the character development between the main character & the baby. Seeing them; eventual affirmative to sibling bonding and familial love makes the film, a little bit more bearable. There is a clear message about the value of brotherhood and the fact that there is enough love for everyone in a family. As for the other ridiculous plot points of the movie where the Boss Baby is on a mission to infiltrated Tim's residence because his parents work for Puppy Co; in the secret war between babies and puppies for their love; it can be easily explained when you remember that the story's being told from the perspective of a 7-year old with an overactive imagination. There are a number of heighted reality scenes that makes us, wonder, if this was young Tim's way in dealing with the news, that his parents were having a baby. After all, it's seem to be, some moments that makes us, question if the Boss Baby was even born. It seems almost as if, indeed, we are supposed to believe that Tim is to some degree an Unreliable Narrator, which explains some of the crazier plot-holes stuff we see, later in the film, such as other babies being able to talk, despite not being boss babies, and adults remembering when they use to be, one. After all, there was scenes where Tim and the babies slams into a tree, vehicles blow up, only to find out, through his mother's POV that many of those interactions are quite possibly only in Tim's imagination. While, these scenes don't excuse the other jarring plot-holes of many scenes like the Elvis airport moment; it does help make, the film more surreal, unique, and downright ambiguous enough to keep the audiences, interesting in what's going on. After all, it could be all real or could be, just a story to inspire young children to accept change. The ending to this film was really surprising, regardless. Overall: You don't mind some toddler toilet humor & nudityand some plot issues. The Boss Baby is a fun, if not instant-classic, movie that parents and kids can enjoy together. Like the opening tune to this movie. I'm in heaven. And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak; and I seem to find the happiness I seek. When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek"
69,The Boss Baby,5,9 June 2017,"Average Plot, Albeit an Energetic Voice Cast,","The Boss Baby is a mediocre movie with a lackluster plot and a top notch voice cast. It's certainly an enjoyable flick, although definitely more so for kids. Alec Baldwin is stellar as the title character, adding a lot of humour with his masculine voice coming out of this little suit wearing baby. The film also has a surprisingly deep showcase of the jealously a first born can go through when a new child arrives and they are no longer getting the attention from their parents that they use to receive, it was actually quite profound. The film offers barely enough humour to keep adults happy. I assumed that Dreamworks would know at this stage that what makes the majority of their movies a financial and critical hit, such as Shrek and Madagascar, is that they have plenty for all age groups. Sadly, this movie only has, for the most part, jokes that will make kids laugh out loud. Steve Buscemi is wasted in this movie as Francis Francis. Likely casted as a result of his stellar work as the animated antagonist in Monsters Inc, he is given a very poor, underdeveloped villain here who is merely causing evil for the sake of it. His character is instantly forgettable and never makes a memorable contribution to this movie. Its a bit of fun while it lasts. An average animated movie with a voice cast that is too good for it, The Boss Baby is worth it if you have kids and want to get something to keep them quiet, as for an older audience, you are better off avoiding this. Jealous of his new baby brother, an imaginative young boy discovers the baby is more than the parents are perceiving him as."
70,The Boss Baby,2,26 July 2017,One-Dimensional,"Trying oh-so hard to be a rollicking comedy, this film comes across more like a classic slapstick Saturday morning cartoon on steroids. Lifting from Disney/Pixar but falling far short, ""Boss Baby"" fails in the same way as ""Secret Life of Pets"" did - overacted, formulaic and shallow."
71,The Boss Baby,8,14 July 2017,"Well made funny adventure for the whole family having a plot with multiple dimensions, highly under-rated","I couldn't believe this movie is rated 6+ as of this review, I came here after watching the movie expecting to see a 7 or maybe even an 8. This is a well made family animation suitable for all ages. It has a couple of inside jokes for adults which are so common place in family animations now. Watch this to finally unravel the mystery of 'where do babies come from?'Kids will experience the adventure and the visuals are sure to stimulate their imagination. Adults may be satisfied with the comic relief, but they can definitely relate to the visuals if they examine their own lives. You may experience the birth of love between siblings and moments of sibling rivalry. If you run a hectic life and find yourself compromising on things that actually matter, the story begs you to answer: was the corner office the real goal or was it a mere resource towards gaining something more meaningful; family, friends and rich personal relationships?"
72,The Boss Baby,3,6 April 2017,Everything worth watching is in the trailer,"Animated film from DreamWorks. The film follows a family with a young son who have another baby (Boss Baby!). The baby takes attention away the son which results in some friction. The son hears the baby talking on the phone, and discovers he's on a mission to stop puppies taking away love, but unfortunately it just doesn't work. The plot is ridiculous, the real plot should be about how a brother copes with a new baby brother, but that's not emphasised enough.The first 15 minutes are funny with interesting ideas, the rest takes an enormous dive, and the plot falls completely flat, the rest is complete nonsense.This film might not be designed for an adult audience but neither was 'Inside Out' or 'Toy Story'. If you want to see a cartoon about family and friendship then see one of these superior alternatives again. Anyone older than 8 years will be bored in no time. I've already forgotten all about this film."
73,The Boss Baby,4,2 May 2017,Good enough,"This movie didn't feel any different from the other anime movies out there. Sure, the sibling dynamics were good, as well as the family values, the childhood memories and older brother anxiety. The main idea was interesting, with the new baby seeming rather like a boss sent into the family to spy on the parents and solve a big problem for his company. You can't help but identify with the older kid, especially if you have younger siblings. But eventually, the action was a bit main stream. The action scenes were not original and kind of boring. Other than that, the story became a little complicated when you start to think about what's real and what's not. The narration was good and the animation was nice, with the cute babies and puppies. So, 4 out of 10."
74,The Boss Baby,6,19 April 2017,Heart Warming and Adorable,"The power of animation really gets used nicely in this movie. The story line was good, entertaining and dramatic. This really is a great movie for all ages. The story line also resembles our current day and age of love versus money, family versus business and as a result I was not really impressed, I like it when TV takes me away from reality.Overall not a bad movie."
75,The Boss Baby,5,12 April 2017,An Animated Film Made to Be Instantly Forgotten,"Disposable animated film with sub-par voice talent, which is surprising that the voices are provided by the likes of Alec Baldwin, Jimmy Kimmel, Steve Buscemi, and Lisa Kudrow. To be fair, the material they're given isn't great, so it might be hard to judge how much falls to them and how much to the film around them. It's entertaining in spurts, but there's nothing surprising and I found myself growing fidgety. My kids seemed to like it well enough, but they're not exactly the most discerning audience.Grade: C"
76,The Boss Baby,4,6 April 2017,Never lives up to its premise or ambition,"The 90-minute ""The Boss Baby"" is one of the more known animated movies from 2017. It is an American production and in the English language of course. The fact that it was made by Dreamworks results in several known names working in here as voice actors, such as Alec Baldwin voicing the title character. You can find out the other names by looking at the cast list. I must say I watched the German dub though, so we got the voice of Dr. House for this title character here as he is also Alec Baldwin's voice. But somehow it wasn't working out really and it just wasn't fitting the character well. Anyway, the movie runs for 90 minutes and it had many other flaws too. First of all I must say the human protagonist, i.e. the boy was completely forgettable in terms of his looks and actions. If you show a picture of him to people (maybe parents) 10 years from now, probably almost nobody will remember where he was from, even if they have seen the film. That's one problem. Another problem would be that the ambition the film has and the emotional impact they are trying to make, also at the very end with the return scene of the baby is never as effective as they want it to be. This also refers to the lullaby references, pretty crucial throughout the movie, but they are never well-crafted enough to make an impact really or to get your eyes wet.The main antagonist here looks like an animated version of Oscar winner Jim Broadbent to be honest, but he was okay, even if I somehow expected him to return later on as a villain when we see Boss Baby idolizing him on the picture. Reminded me a bit of ""Up"". Some okay film references are included in here as well, for example Indiana Jones. Besides that, I liked the early references most of the time when the film switches between how the boy sees reality and what it really looks like, for example when he learns how to use his bicycle or also the prison room scene in the middle of the film roughly. But all these solid scenes do not really make up for all the weaknesses. For example how does the antagonist still know who he was. I am not sure if stopping to drink the special milk erases the memory, but if not then probably I'd have expected the characters who appear at the very end to erase the memory of him like they do with the parents. A bit of a pity, but as a whole I need to agree with the critics who did not really enjoy the movie. i think the general plot, even if a bit on the childish side (but hey it's a film about babies) isn't bad by any means, but the strong execution and love to detail is missing almost entirely. Many of the jokes and plays on words were also really only attempts at comedy. But the ""Scary Poppins"" wasn't bad I'll give them that. Maybe also the German dubbing was bad for some reason I don't known. I have to give it a thumbs-down though and the overall outcome is really only good enough for young audiences I think unlike some other recent animated movies that also have a strong impact on adults. This one here not so much. Watch something else instead."
77,The Boss Baby,9,27 December 2017,An unexpectedly good animation,"A very happy family with a single child receives a new baby, one which will steal all the love from his older brother. What the new brother is about to find out is that he's facing with an unusual baby, one which came on a mission and one that must be helped in order to get rid of. It sounds and it actually is fantastic. The two form a pretty good team and their different characters and skills will prove to be highly entertaining and funny.Just to point this aspect out, although it is easily predictable, the film is very well animated and as a bonus point, it has an unique artistic sense when presenting the whole action though the older brother's imagination. The plot is also very well thought, creating a great atmosphere for the ""childish"" events to take place. It's a very good watch, thanks to its characters, plot and animation, the only thing letting it down being the predictability in important moments."
78,The Boss Baby,10,25 December 2017,awsome,"Hearttouching movie,good i want to see part 2,the action of baby is good and his brother action also.the story is so beautifull."
79,The Boss Baby,10,22 December 2017,Great movie for siblings.,"My son loves this movie, helps that he has a baby brother also. Very cute!"
80,The Boss Baby,7,11 December 2017,Another meh addition to the animation world.,"It was OK, nothing special but not bad. The first half is better than the last.It has great animation, some good stars AND it'll tickle you with some nice refs to older movies.If you haven't seen it, you shouldn't go out of your way to nor should you avoid it. This will probably be watchable every 7 - 10 years."
81,The Boss Baby,6,7 December 2017,"Good for kids nowadays, clichéd for 90s kids","If you were a 90s kid and watched the famous 'Rugrats' you'll find it amusing, entertaining and funny but somewhat mediocre. Personally, I'm usually disappointed as the animation industry focus too much in short-term attention-seeking rather than long-term classic immortality. There were some comical remarks that are plausible but somehow I couldn't fall in love with the movie as it got predictable. It doesn't matter how old you are to love it, I firmly believe children nowadays have a vast repertory of animated movies to watch and can compare one from the others."
82,The Boss Baby,5,27 November 2017,This is actually a very disturbing movie,"BOSS BABY is the saddest movie ever. So...I'm watching The Boss Baby and I think the whole unwritten story of the movie is that the first ""Boss Baby"" died and the parents were so sad that they wrote the whole baby out of their lives (took down pictures, never mentioned him again). Then they had another baby. That's why you never know ""Boss Baby""'s real name until the end. Because Tim was too young to understand and coped by making up a story about a baby with a suit that goes back to their real job then comes back to be his brother. He combined the two babies into one. Either way Tim needs a lot of therapy and that's why at the end you see that the little brother is more successful than Tim is because Tim turned to drugs and blowing dudes for money to get drugs then only turned his life around later with help from his little brother putting him through rehab. Luckily he turns his life around and has a family of his own and gets a menial job working for his little brother. It's really a story about how the parents didn't deal with loss and sent Tim into a downward spiral in life."
83,The Boss Baby,2,26 November 2017,Freud could have written this,"This movie is so full of phobia material and fear mongering for very young kids that it should be rated M. Granted the two main factions of plot action BABYCO and PUPPY CO were hardly very creative, but the action was filled with the most horribly subconsciously active fear generation for the younger kids.The single worst case was an undisputed claim that the first born loses the parent's love when a new born comes into a house. From the view point of a 7 year old this could be devastatingly real but it is rarely true. This movie does not even bother to offer a counter argument! Secondly, fear of babysitters. Not only does this movie encourage that fear by creating a scenario where it comes true but enhances it through the scene by having their phony baby sitter be a cruel MAN dressed as a woman.Yes in fact I do realize this is a fantasy, but its more like it comes from the horror genre of Hansel and Gretel.As a fantasy for adults this is maybe OK but please keep the kids away if they're below 10."
84,The Boss Baby,6,8 November 2017,"an animation to watch with your cousin or younger brother, will certainly amuse them.","The Boss Baby at no time left me wanting to watch, the trailers and synopsis did not attract me, but I decided to watch, the film did not surprise me, but it was bad as I thought, the animation has a good quality and the voice cast is Alec Baldwin, Steve Buscemi, Jimmy Kimmel, Lisa Kudrow, Tobey Maguire, and others, all do a good job, the story is more or less, it's full of ups and downs, I think the film hits 1 and up half of the 2 act, but then the quality drops and the story gets uninteresting, The Boss Baby is a movie, it will not even come in the top 100 of better animations, but otherwise it will not get into the worst ones too. Note 6.0"
85,The Boss Baby,6,5 November 2017,"The Boss Baby is a passable animated film but if you really want to watch it,I recommend watching it only in 3D.","The Boss Baby (2017): In the early days of computer-generated animation, the stories weren't very taxing but the writing was expressive and the animation was breathtaking. However, as the days of Pixar and Dreamworks evolved, the stories started to become more advanced, and it seemed like the technology grew on pace with the storytelling tools that the filmmakers would use. However, with any growth medium, there's bound to be a ceiling, and The Boss Baby is further proof that maybe we should scale back on the CGI films, because while the visuals are still gorgeous, the stories are really starting to drop.Plot: A new baby's arrival impacts a family, told from the point of view of a delightfully unreliable narrator -- a wildly imaginative 7-year-old named Tim. The most unusual Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin) arrives at Tim's home in a taxi, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase. The instant sibling rivalry must soon be put aside when Tim discovers that Boss Baby is actually a spy on a secret mission, and only he can help thwart a dastardly plot that involves an epic battle between puppies and babies.My Review: The Boss Baby is one of the most contrived and complicated children's cartoons you'll see all year.Half-way into the film,you can clearly observes several adult references and crass humor which is cheap way to attract both adults and kids but they guessed it wrong.Grown-ups never need adult jokes to make them laugh and the makers should have rechecked their supposed master plan as we do not expect such grossy comedy from the producers who bought us Kung Fu Panda,Madagascar and lot more.Even the plot of stop a dastardly plan to invent a puppy so adorable that people stop having babies clearly not at all a kid-stuff.Even with such confusing aspects still The Boss Baby is good one to watch with few moments to laugh and definitely will not get bored.But with some focus on clever writing,this movie could have been lot better.The film trades in both vaguely sly ""adult jokes"" and overly broad children's humor, with neither really landing a killing blow of entertainment. What makes this even worse is the fact that the film's story is a disjointed mess that could really use some effective humor to fill in the narrative cracks..But perhaps the best component of The Boss Baby are the retro-futuristic visuals the film is drenched in. The folks who designed the film's look must have really loved The Incredibles, because that film's 60's jet-set style visuals are well represented in every frame of this film.The best part is watching it in 3D.The Boss Baby is one of the best 3D experiences you should watch.The depth and the pop-out effects are brilliantly done that we even forget how lacking the plot is.So,The Boss Baby is a passable animated film but if you really want to watch it,I recommend watching it only in 3D.My Rating 6/10"
86,The Boss Baby,2,4 November 2017,Had me crying right from the start,"The main reason was that I realized I had just wasted my money on a silly, chichéd, unfunny movie - and would have to keep quiet until some other friend started complaining about it too, and we could then just leave the theater. Fortunately, that wasn't very long, and just over 35 minutes after the movie had started, we were free again. Animation was very generic and bland, jokes felt old and beaten. Voice acting was OK, given the lousy script."
87,The Boss Baby,3,18 October 2017,My Peasant Life?,"Wake up little halflings, it's time to leave. Go and live your peasant lives. BEGONE WITH YOU!These are the last words to a solidly mediocre movie starring Baldwin, Kimmel, Kudrow, Buscemi and Maguire called Boss Baby. Most of these actors I genuinely like and appreciate. I feel like Dreamworks though, took a dump in my mouth and hopes that I don't realize what I am eating. Do they just despise being forced to do such broad based comedy that they are mad at the ""peasants""? I know, I knowI am reading too much into this line. But there is no way that there isn't meaning and intention behind this final cut scene. There are lots of ways to say goodbye in a movie. Some clever and some condescending. If you spend the money to put this specific scene in a spot where most will not see it, and those that do will likely not care, to what end is it done? Maybe they know this thing is crap, but still wish to cling to the notion that they are not. My guess is that most of the big names involved in this adventure in potty humor are always publicly praising the ""little guy"" who they wouldn't dare call a peasant to their face. They seem to despise my family, and the rest of us that exist within this vast ocean of mediocrity. I realize that raising your head just a little higher than that ocean is extremely difficult. Unfortunately, this movie weighs like an anchor on the soul of everyone involved.Most of the talent and executives will probably smile to themselves with self-satisfaction as hundreds of millions of dollars are almost guaranteed to roll in from the purse of these peasants. I now hate myself for being one of them. The moment I saw that cut scene, I regretted ever allowing my children the indulgence of such garbage. Take my money and spit in my face toogalling."
88,The Boss Baby,5,10 October 2017,The Boss Baby Review,"The Boss Baby movie is a kids movie which got a lot of attention in social media, so I took a look a it. This movie is eh, its not original(same old plot from 'Wreck and Ralph'), it is extremely predictable from the start to finish. The jokes in this movie are cringy and immature, only little kids will probably laugh at this. It has tons of references like ""Lord of the Rings"" trying to relate to the viewer, even some adult jokes. I really recommend this for small children which could relate a little on getting a new sibling. But over all it is just an average film, I give it a 5/10."
89,The Boss Baby,7,30 September 2017,surprisingly good,"Tim Templeton has the perfect life. He and his parents form the perfect triangle. His parents work at Puppy Co. One day, a new baby (Alec Baldwin) arrives at their door. Tim is bitter that his parents are completely head over heels for the impeccably suited baby. He's actually a smart Boss Baby on a mission for Baby Corp to stop Puppy Co.'s new Forever Puppy.I expected nothing more than another stupid kids movie relying on poop jokes. This is more than that. There is surprisingly few poop jokes. On the other hand, it has an interesting original idea and it works. It's kinda fun and hits on a real thing about sibling rivalries. The characters are good. I'm shocked that this is pretty good."
90,The Boss Baby,9,27 September 2017,You may want to watch this with your brother...,"Beyond the main plot of this movie, which is, to be fair, quite entertaining but as you might expect: very flawed; this movie is about brotherhood, friendship, love and companion.Babycorp might not even exist, everything in the movie might just be happening inside Tim's head as he struggles to share his parent's love and attention with the new family member. Many scenes in the movie evolve around the idea that Tim is a very imaginative kid, and the way they are presented really makes you believe that nothing is actually happening (the backyard action scene, or that one with the pacifiers). Tim can easily build complex scenarios where he is the hero of the story and saves the day. Maybe just as ""Inside Out"" could be just the projections of a kid going into puberty, maybe ""Baby Boss"" plot is just the rhetorical device of a boy who doesn't want a little brother, but ends up loving his company.Either way, it was a very entertaining movie. If you want a fast paced story, occasionally innocent but clever jokes and some peaceful and fun time with your children, family or even your own brother, you'll definitely enjoy this amazing movie."
91,The Boss Baby,8,27 September 2017,Cute and funny movie,"This movie is the second to last movie from Dreamworks Animation until their next movie in 2019, due to Universal handling distribution for their movies now that they're owned by Comcast, and it's a good one. Chock full of potty humor and great music and action, The Boss Baby is the best comedy of the year, even though it's computer animated."
92,The Boss Baby,8,25 September 2017,Bossed it,"OK so I finally watched this much talked about wonder film that has been the talk amongst many. I have heard mixed reviews of it. Some have said that they were disappointed and others said it had them in stitches. Well my personal opinion is that I was laughing in the opening 10 minutes. I thought it was a great film!! I don't understand how people got bored during it. Maybe I have a childish sense of humour, oh well I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend this to people, it would not be the first thing I would recommend but if it came up when in conversation then I would recommend it. The story line was great, the jokes were perfectly timed, the characters did not disappoint, the way it all came across was perfect. Unfortunately I do no have a lot more to say on this, I feel like I've kind of said it all already. Which isn't a bad thing. Follow me on Instagram @gabewatling and Twitter @gmwatling"
93,The Boss Baby,5,17 September 2017,Funny in places! 5/10,"Review: I did quite enjoy this funny animated movie, which is fun for the whole family but it did get a bit silly after a while. It's about a 7 year old boy, Tim, who is spoilt by his parents, until they adopt a baby, who arrives with a suit and a briefcase. As the baby is getting all of the attention, Tim decides to investigate the babies strange behaviour, and he hears him talking on the phone about a secret mission. The baby then cuts a deal with Tim, to help him take down Puppy Co., who wants to make puppies take over from babies, and then he will leave and go back to the company. While they are trying to solve the case, they become close friends and they risk there lives to save the world. There are some funny moments, especially from the Boss Baby, voiced by Alec Baldwin but I was expecting more. The animation looked great and the fast paced concept will be a hit with children but from an adults point of view, it's pretty average. Don't get me wrong, the little baby did crack me up in places, and it did make a hell of a profit at the box office but it lacked wit once they became buddies. It still worth a watch, especially on a family day out, and I'm sure the sequel will smash the box office. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Tom McGrath, 53, who also directed all 3 of the Madagascar movies and Megamind, so he was the perfect choice for this movie. He is also due to direct Rentaghost, which I used to watch as a kid, so I hope he doesn't make a mess of the movie. With so many animated movies coming out recently, he done well by creating something fresh and original, which will keep the kids quiet for an hour and a half, so I can't wait to see what they do with Boss Baby 2, which isn't due for release until 2021.Budget: $125million Worldwide Gross: $500millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/family/comedies, voiced by Alec Baldwin, Steve Buscemi, Jimmy Kinmel, Lisa Kudrow, Tobey Maguire and James McGrath. 5/10"
94,The Boss Baby,5,4 September 2017,A very confusing and strange mess.,"Oh DreamWorks, where did you go wrong? As most of you know, DreamWorks has been really struggling recently to come up with a very good animated movie after Disney started turning out some fantastic movies. Recently, DreamWorks has made some bad duds like ""Home"" and ""Trolls"" and sadly, ""The Boss Baby"" is yet another one. While it's nowhere near as bad as the previous movies and the appalling marketing of the film made by Fox, it's still left me feeling very confused and pretty shocked. I'll try to explain why that is because honestly, it's really hard to say why.Timmy Templeton (Miles Bakshi) is living a happy life with his parents Ted and Janice (Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow). That is until the new baby ""brruuuuu-tthhhher"" (this is an actual ""joke"" from the movie) arrives. The Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin) as he is know by, starts to take up the Timmy's precious time with his parents, which makes him very jealous. After discovering the baby's secret that he can apparently talk, it is revealed that he works for a company called Baby Corp., a sort of business in the clouds run by, you guessed it, babies. It is then revealed that the Boss Baby is trying to uncover a secret plan from the companies rival Puppy Co. who is planning to reveal a new puppy to rival the cuteness of babies. Wanting to leave the house so he can get promoted at his company, the Boss Baby teams up with Timmy to uncover the secret of Puppy Co. before it's too late. That was my best description of the plot because it was so confusing to follow.The idea of the movie itself is pretty stupid. After seeing some of the horrible trailers for the film, I immediately thought DreamWorks had hit rock bottom in their film department. Then after doing some research, I discovered that this film was inspired by a picture book written by Marla Frazee which clarified a lot of problems I had with the movie. If the film had been released as a twenty minute short film with the Puppy Co. elements removed, I think it would have had a better chance. However, since the elements are present, the film just felt like it was stretched thin. As for the animation, it's awful. I mean terrible. It tried to be cartoony and over the top and I think it went way overboard which made it pretty painful to watch. Also, the film clearly was meant to be viewed in 3D, but because I saw it in a typical 2D showing, the elements that are supposed to pop out of the screen just looked awkward. As for the characters, there mostly unfunny. The kids will get bored by the business talk while adults might get shocked by some of the jokes. One joke that absolutely shocked me was a joke involving religion. What were they thinking when they put that in? Also, while I think Alec Baldwin can be funny at times, he felt really out of place as the baby. He's supposed to play the younger brother of a seven year old boy yet the older version of Timmy was played by Tobey Maguire who's nearly twenty younger than Baldwin. Isn't that ridiculous? The other actors like Lisa Kudrow and even Jimmy Kimmel who made me laugh out loud at the Oscars, didn't have anything funny to do in the film. The only notable exception is Miles Bakshi who I felt was perfectly cast as Timmy and actually did make me chuckle a bit.""The Boss Baby"" just felt like a confusing and dull waste of time. I feel really bad for the director, Tom McGrath, who has made many good movies in the past with DreamWorks, but sadly he didn't bring the humor and charm of his previous movies into this film. If you want a better movie that focuses on babies, just rent ""Storks"". However, if your kids really want to watch this movie, it's not a bad movie to put on a to distract the kids. Just don't expect a lot out of it."
95,The Boss Baby,7,31 August 2017,Surprisingly Good,"I actually liked Boss Baby a whole lot more than I was anticipating.A suit wearing, walking, talking baby appears via taxi to join the family of two executives and their son from Puppy Co to help save the world from a dastard plot.After initially despising each other the brothers work together to try and save the world from a puppy that never ages.Cute. Lots of Laughs. Appropriate for the whole family."
96,The Boss Baby,7,30 August 2017,The Boss Baby: Predictably quaint,"Alec Baldwin stars as the titular character of this much hyped Dreamworks animation and though it's not exactly going to blow anyone away it's an entertaining fluff piece.Predictably sappy, following the usual tropes of the genre and with the type of humour customary for these types of movies you can do a lot worse with 90 minutes.One thing I liked was just how much adult humour they got in, that kind of lightweight stuff to appease the parents watching these kind of films with their kids.The only shocking thing to come away from this is the fact the sequel isn't available until 2021! Fun stuff but don't expect any surprises.The Good: Quaint in that predictable way The Bad: Quaint in that predictable way Things I learnt from this movie: Puppies are evil Babies coming from women's vaginas is a false rumour (Never did sound right)"
97,The Boss Baby,6,30 August 2017,"This Boss Baby has ruthless wit and a heart, if also inconsistency","Was not expecting much at all from 'The Boss Baby'. The trailers were absolutely dreadful, some of the worst for any film released this year, giving the impression that 'The Boss Baby' would be one of the year's worst films.Still saw 'The Boss Baby' with an open mind and with a willingness to give it a fair chance. Especially considering that there has been a fair share of films seen by me that have awful, misleading advertising but actually turned out to be good to outstanding films (like 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame', 'Galaxy Quest' and 'Lilo and Stitch', that gave the complete opposite impressions of the films they turned out to be). After seeing it, 'The Boss Baby' is not a great film and its quality is inconsistent, but it was much better than expected and was nowhere near the awful film the advertising made it look.DreamWorks have certainly done far better, 'How to Train Your Dragon' is outstanding, 2010's best animated film (just edging out 'Tangled') and one of the year's best, and 'The Prince of Egypt' is one of my favourite films. 'The Boss Baby' is towards their weaker end of their animations along with 'Bee Movie' and especially 'Home'. There are still a lot of great merits.First and foremost, the animation is extremely good. Meticulous in detail and vibrantly colourful, and the characters are modelled appealingly. The soundtrack is infectious and catchy, with the choices in music fitting well. Some of the jokes are very funny and witty, with sly and clever references to some of Alec Baldwin's other roles and a surprising gag based on David Mamet, that is daring for an animated film.Underneath all the wit, 'The Boss Baby' also has a heart with a few touching moments and important lessons on love and family. This angle doesn't come completely successfully certainly but the good intentions are there and it is not as if it didn't try. Mostly the film moves along with a lot of energy. There are a few entertaining characters along the way, with the titular character recalling fond memories of Alec Baldwin's character in '30 Rock'. The voice acting is terrific, especially a dynamite turn from Baldwin.'The Boss Baby' on the other hand is not without its faults. The story is formulaic, with a thin premise stretched thin and is let down by a very messy utter chaos of a first act. Not all the jokes hit the mark, hurt by predictability, a tendency to veer towards doodiness in alternative to wit and a lack of maturity, while the family values angle doesn't come off entirely successfully, some of it being mawkish and preachy.Not all the characters work either, some of them are very sketchily written and developed. This is especially with Steve Buscemi's villainous character. Buscemi excels at villains and does his very best in a role that should have been tailor made for him, but lacks the material to properly sink his teeth into it.In conclusion, uneven but nowhere close to being as bad as the advertising and some of the critical reaction made it look. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

99,The Boss Baby,8,23 August 2017,A Great Family Film,"this is a great film brilliant for the family, thoroughly entertaining full of laughs, great acting by Alec Baldwin, slightly emotional when the boy wants attention but the baby is taking all of it you feel sorry for the kid. loved the effects and the plot I simply cant wait for the sequel."
100,The Boss Baby,10,23 August 2017,So so funny!,"I am not a huge fan of kids' movies but checked this out at the library because I am an Alec Baldwin fan. I was laughing so hard.

Many shout outs to some of the great adventure movies hidden in the content as well. I hope there is a Boss Baby 2!"
101,The Boss Baby,8,14 August 2017,enjoyed it!,"I found myself really enjoying this movie, although I kinda thought the movie lost a little steam near the 3/4 mark. Thought it was better than some of the other animated flicks that came out within the last year (Storks, Secret Life of Pets, and Sing; thought all three were barely a 5/10 rating). The scene with L.T.D. well known single ""back in love"" playing was a pleasant surprise for song choice."
102,The Boss Baby,9,11 August 2017,A movie kids and adults can enjoy,"I was shocked to learn that this movie only got 51% from a different movie review page. The first time i watched it i thought it was cute and my kids liked it so whatever. The next time i watched it with my kids i noticed all these things i hadn't seen before. Like how the rocket, mousetrap, train and other action sequences were all toys in Tim's room and the entire movie was the way a 7 year old viewed adjusting to having a baby brother. That's something that both kids and adults can relate to and made this a very sweet movie."
103,The Boss Baby,8,9 August 2017,This comedy brings out your inner child,"This was actually a very good comedy.At first I thought that it would be like most other cartoon movies,but this actually combines adult humor with children jokes.This movie is like watching family guy combined with a kid's show to make a funny but unharmful type of movie.If you want a movie that reminds of what it's like to be a child,then this is it."
104,The Boss Baby,7,6 August 2017,"""The Boss Baby""- Surprisingly amusing and heartwarming despite what the lackluster advertising suggested.  Not perfect, but it'll win over kids and give parents a few laughs.","If there ever was a prime example of the old idiom ""Don't judge a book by its cover"", that would certainly be Dreamworks' 2017 release ""The Boss Baby,"" directed by Tom McGrath and inspired by the picture book of the same name by Marla Franzee. With sharp, strong animated visuals and a general abundance of both humor and heart, the film is for all intents and purposes charming enough that it will certainly win over its targeted audience of young children, while providing a few laughs here and there for their parents. Which is a far-cry from how it was portrayed in the frankly atrocious previews and trailers that littered cinemas in the months leading up to its release. It's just unfortunate that a few clichés and a very weak first act make it fall flat a bit too often for it to be called anything more than ""pretty good, but not great.""We follow narrator Timothy Templeton (Miles Bakshi/Tobey Maguire) as he tells the story of how he first met his baby brother Theodore (Alec Baldwin) back when he was a seven-year-old. Feeling neglected with his parents' attention almost exclusively held by Theodore, Timothy eventually learns a startling truth- Theodore, who prefers to be called ""Boss Baby"", can not only talk, but is also a super- intelligent representative of a mysterious company that is dispatching other like-minded newborns to families the world over. Their goal- to try to figure out why all of the love (the most powerful force in the world) that babies formerly held has suddenly been shifting more and more towards puppies. And it may have to do with a nefarious pet-store corporation that Timothy's parents (Jimmy Kimmel/Lisa Kudrow) work for...That sounds absolutely ridiculous, but in the context of the movie, it actually kind of works. The film is at its best after it gets all the prerequisite and predictable ""Wow, that baby acting like an adult sure looks funny!"" jokes out of the way and instead is able to focus more on the central plot. A central plot which is so completely nuts, it actually ends up being pretty charming in its own cartoony way. The film thankfully seems to recognize how thin the gimmick of baby with an adult mind is, and compensates with some good heartwarming moments and plenty of fun action and adventure beats that will delight both children and adults alike. I also enjoyed the fact that the movie does make an actual effort to build something of a mystery to be solved by our lead characters. And I'll admit, even as a man pushing thirty, there were a few good twists and turns along the way that I didn't always see coming. Which is no small feat for a film aimed at young children.The film's voice cast is fantastic, and lend a lot to the proceedings, elevating what could have been merely a passable movie into one I'd comfortably recommend. Alec Baldwin does indeed steal the show as ""Boss Baby"", and it comes across in his voice that he seems to be having some fun with the role. He's very animated in his delivery (no pun intended) and gives a lot of ""oomph"" to the performance that helps define the character beyond the gimmick. I also really enjoyed Mike Bakshi and Tobey Maguire, who perform the same character in Timothy- Bakshi portraying the voice of Timothy as a child, while Maguire provides narration for him as an adult. Timothy is likable and daring, and both actors help drive this home. Kimmel and Kudrow are a good bit of fun, as are some supporting roles played by the likes of Steve Buscemi and Conrad Vernon. This is aided by some sharp visuals thanks to director McGrath, in addition to the absolutely gorgeous animation provided by Dreamworks. All around, it's a very competent movie.Unfortunately, it is brought down a few pegs with some very wonky moments, particularly early on. The first act of the film is the messiest and can often feel like it's dragging on and on and on... It's where the movie loads up all the jokes you'd expect, and it is bore as a result. Everything in the god-awful trailers? That's all loaded into the first twenty or so minutes. It can feel a little overpowering, which is a shame, because the movie does pick up the pace almost immediately when the second act rolls around. But that first act is... bad. I also did have some issues with how much the film is a slave to cliché despite the delightfully bizarre story- you can typically guess what's coming and it does hurt the movie at times. I know that's maybe not fair to complain about in a kid's movie... but it bothered me.But those are not enough to ruin an otherwise surprisingly thoughtful and engaging little movie that boasts good humor and heart to boot. The cast is absolutely fantastic, the visuals mind- bending, and the plot so silly you can't help but have some fun with it. ""The Boss Baby"" doesn't come close to matching the high quality of Dreamworks' best films... but it's a worthy addition to their filmography and is significantly better than I'd have thought it would be. And so, I give ""The Boss Baby"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Kids will love it, and parents will like it."
105,The Boss Baby,7,4 August 2017,The baby on a mission!,"If you ask anybody from the pre 90s, they would say their love for animated feature started with 'Toy Story'. But mine was DreamWorks' 'Antz'. So this production house might not be as good as Disney or Pixar, but still a better one than the rest of those who are in the same business, except Sony who comes equal. I wanted this film to be good, yeah, it is a box office hit, but not critically. The regular animated film goer accepted it. And I think as well, it is entertaining, so much fun in parts, if not the entire film.The story of a boy whose happy life being an only child has taken away from his newborn little brother. Then one day he discovers the baby could speak and came to the house with a bigger plan. Knowing what it is and joining hands with him to tackle is what the remaining narration covers. Quite fun film. Animation, story and all the adventures were good. The voice-over was great. Alec Baldwin was awesome, but it's fair to praise the technicians, the animators.At first, I thought some of the jokes were rude, if the film is for families, particularly for the kids. But when I watched the rest of the film, it did not look going anymore worse. A simple story and predictable, but it was enjoyable, that makes you forget yourself for a while. Despite the mixed response in acceptance, I've heard the sequel is on, in a couple of years. I think it is a good decision, even the storyline, how it ended encourages that. It's not going to be your favourite animated film, but surely not to be missed if you love animation.7/10"
106,The Boss Baby,5,4 August 2017,I guess this is fine if you're a kid,"There are three basic types of family friendly cartoons. There are some that are entertaining to both adults and kids. There are some only entertaining for the young set. And then, of course, there are some that everyone hates.As an adult with no children, I have to guess as to the child appeal of Boss Baby, but for elderly me, this movie falls short.My guess is that kid's would like it. The basic premise is pretty good. A young boy, whose imagination causes him to describe all his experiences in wildly unlikely terms, gets a baby brother who wears a suit and is plotting against him and other things. The boy's flights of fancy are imaginatively handled, as in his portrayal of a baby play date as a horror-movie nightmare.But imaginative isn't the same as funny, and the movie's humor feels weak and rote. There is something predictable in both the jokes and the pathos.One of the differences between adults and children is that adults have seen it all before and children haven't. So for a child Boss Baby will be far less predictable and the jokes far more original. And since it's well animated, I think kids would probably like this.But if you're an adult, you're better off with Up, or Toy Story, or Giant Robot, or Spirited Away, or Despicable Me, or, really, a ton of movies that are more entertaining for the over-10 set."
107,The Boss Baby,10,29 July 2017,probably the best movie i've ever seen in my diddly darn life,"the boss baby is like the best darn film ever, holy heck. every single poop joke was like the funniest thing in history ever, oh boy. the animation is beautiful, the movements are all fluid and the stylized view of tim's imagination is gorgeously portrayed. also they make a joke about the boss baby getting a binky stuck up his little boss butt within the first five minutes, so you know it's gonna be a doozy. speaking of the boss baby's butt, there are a fair few shots of it in the movie. hearing alec baldwin's voice come out of a character and then seeing his little baby butt is probably the best moment in all of filmmaking history. anyway yeah its basically the best movie ever, definitely watch this movie at least 50 times."
108,The Boss Baby,6,26 July 2017,Puppy love,"The Boss Baby is a film that kids will enjoy and the adults will find it amiable and also get the message.It has a 1970s tinge to it with music from television shows of the era. An imaginative 7 year old boy, Tim has great loving parents but when a baby brother arrives they have less time for him as the newcomer manipulates attention from them and Tim gets elbowed out.From Tim's imaginative mind this new baby is the boss, a business baby sent on a mission to unearth something that will take away grown ups attention and love towards babies. Tim and his baby brother join forces to infiltrate a shady company that has developed the next must have puppy dogs.The film has a bit of a formulaic ring about it which a lot of Disney and Dreamworks animations have when it comes to the reveal of the film's villain. It also is a bit disjointed at times, scenes inserted where the brothers have unnecessary falling outs.Still Alec Baldwin is in his element as the Boss baby and he certainly means business."
109,The Boss Baby,2,25 July 2017,utter wastage of time,"senseless story, crappy characters and dumb dialogues...a five minute tom an jerry episode contains much more fun than this nonsensical piece of crap. total waste of time and money. i wonder if the writer has any idea of creating story lines or did he just come up with storyline after waking up"
110,The Boss Baby,10,22 July 2017,""" Cookies are for closers. ""","A suit-wearing, briefcase-carrying baby pairs up with his 7-year old brother to stop the dastardly plot of the CEO of Puppy Co. The Boss Baby gracefully succeeds thanks to an amazing and hilarious performance by Alec Baldwin who portrays the title character. The chemistry between Tim and The Boss Baby is really one of the strongest parts of the movie. Some jokes are kinda mature for kids but personally i don't think that they will understand them because they will mostly laugh at the jokes rather than care to anything else. Steve Buscemi is perfectly casted as the villain and it's so great to still see Tobey Maguire get actual roles he narrates the film and he portrays Tim in an older age also the movie ends in a spectacular and surprising way that shows that a 'Boss Baby 2' is definitely coming. Overall this film was funny, full of great messages about older and younger brothers plus the meaning of family. Plus those other babies were so freaking hilarious especially the big one. (10/10)"
111,The Boss Baby,6,21 July 2017,Great movie for kids,"Now, for the diaper galore film involving a young boy and his new baby brother teaming up to defeat an evil businessman. "" BOSS BABY"" This DreamWorks film is twisted together in a slightly confusing story-line. The Boss Baby is a colorful animated film that's complete with a sibling rivalry highlighting biased affection.Tim is a young imaginative boy with his head always in the clouds. He doesn't see the world the same way anyone else does and that's one special thing his parents share with him. Leading to the five-minute introduction of a seven-year-old boy pretending to be a pirate.A slight over explanation of the time his parents spend with him. Now, the story really begins once his younger brother arrives in a business suit and a briefcase..already able to walk. A little strange don't you think. And the craziest thing is that his parents seem to think it's wait for it CUTE! Not strange but apparently cute. If I saw a three- day old baby walking in a suit, I would probably have to be admitted into a psychiatric hospital. Tim resents the arrival of his younger brother.Roll credits BOSS BABY. Who dominates the time and love of his parents.Which then leads the story along baby meetings and lawnmower fights. And as you would expect, entertaining for kids. Kids and infants will most likely enjoy this film from the classic slapstick and awkward toilet humor. Not to mention the occasional comedic set pieces. Personally, the main thing that made me laugh was that a sixty-year-old man was voicing a.baby. Some entertaining moments, however, included the quarrels between the ""siblings"" and how gullible the parents are to not notice. Brutally hilarious however was when Tim's little brother rolls down a flight of stairs into the middle of the street.Tim's fertile imagination is open to a plethora of ideas as he deals with the introduction of a new family member. This could and should have been elaborated on just to showcase some of the things we'd like to think little kids do when they're left alone. Again, an interesting topic that could have changed the entire movie. Instead, we get repetitive chase sequences, continuous ironic moments when parents don't notice what's going on, and an entire movie based off of what may offend dog lovers.The Animation, however, was quite outstanding and I loved the personality of the chubby muscular baby. So it's a win-win scenario if you're looking for some good laughs."
112,The Boss Baby,7,20 July 2017,Let's Hope The Modest Success Does Not End In A Franchise Torment,"Blessed be the only children who didn't have to stand the discomfort with the intrusion of a new sibling. Arguably, whatever the reason, jealousy ( the over sensitive response that arises when you see a threat over something of great personal value) emerges innately in humans: in a love relationship, at work, at school, in the family. On this familiar premise, ""The Baby Boss"" hits on the correct artery in order to delight both parents and children with a boyish thinking message that will convince by way of gags even the most skeptical and cerebral movie buff.The feature film is ""freely"" inspired by the children's book published in 2010 by Marla Frazee, ""freely"" because development isn't pulled out from the pages verbatim, without talking about the unequal design of pictures. DreamWorks still keeps up, by reminding its contenders that they returned to take back the prerogative gained with animated audiovisual productions such as ""Madagascar,"" ""Shrek,"" ""Kung Fu Panda,"" and latest ""Trolls."" It sets Tom McGrath as a filmmaker, the ideal director due to he's directed several movies of the company's orders, has also addressed with different content about childhood in his films in an underlying way. The script embraces high doses of gags and sketches that will look after mostly adults, this inclination is inductive when we find out that his writer, Michael McCullers, was the man who conceived the scripts of ""Austin Powers"" or ""Baby Mama"" and some episodes of American NBC'S ""Saturday Night Live"". Here slapstick and deadpan are mixed with the beautiful thoughts of a 7-year-old child to provide a compendium of occurrences touching deeply in the general public with great assertiveness. Sweeping aside the festive subject, the nuclear story line evokes productions that applied the same central narrative skeleton (""Look Who's Talking"", ""Littleman"" or ""Family Guy"" series), a steadfast structure due to the warm welcome by the audience, the nonsense of the jocular pantomime of a baby working as an older man is the strongest fun producer. However, focusing on the plot and its progress, the mind of an infant is the device used to spark a succession of full positions of inventiveness, in addition, it manages to keep pace and dynamic firmly during the three acts, although the second section was prolonged more than it should be had. As a movie chiefly intended for children, lessons must be of great importance. At first, I had to deal with strong headaches about how they could present an appropriate closing to the story, as due to the passing of the situations seemed that it'd be getting an ending out of the ordinary, nonetheless, happy endings will always be. Beyond accepting the newcomer, the film reflects on teamwork, discrepancy-solving and a poorly worked labor aspect, however, children must receive a small explanation by their parents because of the ""complexity"" of lessons comprehension.Despite the fact that it weights the previous considerations, disrupts the impact of topics which aren't explicit on screen and suddenly the arduous search not to adopt the label of the commercial title is eradicated in full. The two cute main leads are engagingly designed, 7-year-old Tim assumes the figure of father and he has the responsibility to select the most circumspect decisions; the counterpoint is the baby, who with the tyrannical voice of Alec Baldwin achieves the execution of adorable effects. Undoubtedly, the title character is the spotlight, however, the real hero is Tim. Although the villain character is prorated between tender canine pets, campaign creator and his henchman, they diverge as soon as the baby appears on the screen.While it falls apart in the formation of some approaches, embraces as a key piece its animation, which keeping in mind guidelines established by Pixar in terms of scrupulosity and concern for detail, loiters between the sweet and the effective, and this doesn't result in a handful of anodyne images exactly, based on two- dimensional lines, on the contrary, these ones' brilliance give rise to concentrate on textures and colors of the fabulous imagination, which from the first minutes run an interesting introduction. Tim's imaginary visions affect the presentation of them, which gamble with a range of designs and arts, beautifully devised by astonishing 3D (the effect with a drop of drool is maddening). The soundtrack isn't high, but it fits in each frame with certain effectiveness, from Beatles' altered melodies to OST, fit together in dramatic scenes or frantic car chases.With a straight-to-the-point start and an emotional mature conclusion, Tom McGrath's ""The Baby Boss"" serves to introduce DreamWorks back into the audiovisual animated panorama, at the same time it expresses, from the perspective of a 7-year-old child, the affective parity that parents must have with the arrival of a new baby and the acceptance and understanding from the only child who should assimilate the arrival of a sibling. In addition, as a mass consumption movie, parents and children enjoy the two fabulous first parts of the feature film, however, it will be fatiguing to digest the last segment going back to a happy ending and the corresponding death of the villain. Perhaps, one day, a movie will break narrative projections of animation, meanwhile, let's enjoy the visual candies of this baby and his corporate mission. The diaper of animation is slowly getting dirty."
113,The Boss Baby,6,16 July 2017,The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Boss BabyThe best time to ask your newborn boss for a raise is when you're changing their diaper.Unfortunately, the CEO in this animated family movie always has the advantage.Tim's (Tobey Maguire, Miles Bakshi) perfect life is disrupted when his parents (Lisa Kudrow, Jimmy Kimmel) have another child, Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin). Sharply dressed and keenly acute, the husky-voiced youngster informs Tim that he has been sent from elsewhere to turn the tide in the babies' battle against puppy popularity.But if Tim doesn't help stop the release of an everlasting puppy, Boss Baby will become his brother forever.An unsettling blend of low fertility rate propaganda, Loony Tune-esque sex education and smart mouthed infants, DreamWork's latest offering borrows too heavily from funnier sources. Although Baldwin's voice work is exceptional as always, nothing much else in this bizarre cartoon works. Besides, kids already know that all babies come from China. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
114,The Boss Baby,3,25 April 2017,Basically Trump as a baby but it's just one of these movies,"It's just another one of these boring and formulaic movies that adults won't like but kids will surely enjoy. The story is pretty stupid but there are a bunch of movies that have done this. I'm hoping the new Captain Underpants movie won't be like this because Dreamworks is running out of ideas.Overall, it's not a movie I would watch."
115,The Boss Baby,4,31 March 2017,"Harmless, But No Real Message to Take Home","The ""Boss Baby"" introduced early on in the movie reminded me so much of the cold-hearted, self-absorbed, not interested in hearing others, clueless to his own obnoxiousness type of boss I thankfully had only once and for a short time in my long career. Unfortunately, I was sort of blinded to the movie as I revoltingly relived that chapter in my life. But at least they made this type of ""Boss"" the ""bad guy,"" for which I am thankful.The only positive message I could glean from this movie is, ""It is better to be a helpless baby who loves and is loved, than to be a know-it-all who neither loves or is loved."" All in all, I could have spent my $60 in a more productive way. But getting to have time with my nine year old daughter made it worthwhile. I encourage spending time with your children. Just pick another movie."
116,The Boss Baby,8,7 June 2017,"""The Boss Baby"" Was Fun For Our Family","My daughter had been asking to see ""Boss Baby"" ever since she saw the first preview over two months ago. So as you can imagine, expectations were pretty high. I knew from the start there were going to be lots of jokes with a tender story about sibling rivalry that turns to love of family. What I got was lots of imagination, some good chuckles, and a decent story. Much of the humor for the kids is potty humor and slapstick at its best. But they also chocked it full of nods to great movies and jokes that only the parents would catch or understand (which worked great). Alec Baldwin (the voice of Boss Baby) is the obvious the star of the show and he takes no prisoners. I can't even tell you who the other voices were in the movie because they didn't matter. This was his time to shine and he took it. The story moves very quickly and my wife actually felt that it was too convoluted for kids. I thought the ending got overly dramatic for no good reason. My daughter thought it was ""great"" and chose the ending as her favorite part. All in all, we all enjoyed it as a family."
117,The Boss Baby,10,5 June 2017,I love the movie!!,"Baby boss is so cute and sweet, yet still bossy. I love the movie, it's good to watch it with the kids. It has a very nice message at the end. Love is everything, everywhere, anywhere! I love the way they think of making a nice movie like this, I love how creative the movie was made, and I love how cute baby boss is! I just love everything about this movie."
118,The Boss Baby,3,3 June 2017,The movie that shows that Dreamworks are out of ideas.,"Dreamworks has been going downhill since Shrek 3, and it hasn't gotten much better either. The only movies I like from them are Shrek 1 and 2 and Dragons 1 and 2. All of the others? Shameless cash grabs with something in it that resembles a plot with the odd laugh her and there. Not to say the other Dreamworks movies don't fail their purpose, hell some of them ARE entertaining, but they are just in general really bad movies. The Boss Baby is one of those movies. Except with this one, I felt more uncomfortable watching it then all of the other Dreamworks movies. It was pretty much worse version of Home from 2015, which REALLY shows that Dreamworks is out of ideas. Not only is Boss Baby a rehash of their film from 2 years ago, it's somehow worse than the original movie. The plot for both of them was really generic, the humour wasn't really appealing. Both movies are absolute train wrecks. This movie only made me laugh once, exactly like Home. The whole movie is just Home but remade. And it's terrible. I would not recommend this movie. It could've been something good if it wasn't a rehash of Home. But it is, and it's worse. 3/10."
119,The Boss Baby,6,29 April 2017,"So, there's this baby. He's not like any baby, though. He's cute but not really. He talks but not really. He acts. . . and acts like a boss. That's wacky!","This film stitches together a crazily convoluted plot of kids' movie clichés like it's making a be-suited Frankenstein's monster.Baldwin plays a slick, smarmy business baby that arrives unexpectedly at the Templeton family's home in a taxi and proceeds to channel the actor's Glengarry Glen Ross corporate trainer and 30 Rock executive in a near-constant stream of film and managerial references. Of course Janice and Ted Templeton (Lisa Kudrow and Jimmy Kimmel) were expecting a new baby, but not like this. The other person not expecting this (at least not THAT way) is the Templeton's seven-year-old son, Tim (Miles Christopher Bakshi). Tim doesn't want a baby brother. He's happy being the sole object of his parents' affection. Rather than establishing the relationship between parent and child, this is discussed at length in confusing and unnecessary voice-over by Tobey Maguire as Future Tim. In between a plethora of anus jokes (The Boss Baby has more on- screen butts than your average episode of Game of Thrones), the movie pitches you the ideas that babies are made in a factory in heaven, some for families and some for corporate use, and that there is an unending and vicious war between babies and puppies for the finite amount of love in the world.For the most part, it's merely mediocre, trotting out all the overly familiar ""Believe in yourself"" and ""importance of family"" messages that every other CGI family flick must preach. However, there's something downright tragic about all the money, time and talent it took to make this instantly forgettable movie that's summed up entirely by a title. Everyone involved could have done something better, especially the animators, who toiled for hundreds of hours on something that will be met with a mild shrug.The overall message is undeniable: Even if a BABY says he wants to be a BOSS, he really wants to be a BABY. Because he is a BABY."
120,The Boss Baby,,2 April 2017,"Boss Baby confuses adult movie critics, but entertains everyone else","Grade: BRating: PG, 97 minutesIn a Nutshell: With great animation and voice talent, this film has some confusing elements that baffle adults. But let's face it, it's made for kids and they simply won't care that a lot of the plot points don't make sense. They're just going to laugh and move on to the next animated flick.Uplifting theme: ""There's plenty of love for everyone.""  Tim (Miles Christopher Bakshi) ""Whether you think you can or can't, you're right."" The Boss Baby spouts off a bunch of platitudes like that during one particular scene. Family is the most important thing. ImaginationThings I liked: Alec Baldwin was really fantastic. He added to the skilled animation and the animation added to his performance. Outstanding blend. Tobey Maguire's voice always makes for the perfect, reflective narrator who has become wise through time and experience. It's cute in 3D, but not necessary. The animation and sound effects are so great that drool and farts have texture. Another outstanding blend. The parents in the audience I sat with absolutely loved the assembly line scene at the beginning of the movie. Adorable. I got a kick out of the Elvis scene, maybe because I live in Las Vegas. When there are a bunch of Elvis, are they called ""Elvi""? Some cute scene transitions. I loved the magical sound of the laughing baby whenever the Boss Baby would revert back to being a baby. Is that from a YouTube video? I love how Dreamworks always takes important items from the movie and incorporates them into their logo at the beginning of the film. I used to be the National Marketing Director for a company. I thought it was hilarious that the babies who didn't laugh were the ones who went into management of the company. Ha ha ""Wake up halflings!"" alarm clock which featured lines from The Lord of the Rings: Motion Picture Trilogy Blu-ray. I just finished binge- watching that awesome trilogy again. Such great movies. Poopies diaper brand. Ha ha Some things really made me laugh out loud. There are plenty of jokes and gags for parents to get a kick out of. Fans of Jimmy Kimmel Live! will enjoy hearing him voice the dad.Things I didn't like: It was clever to animate Tim's imagination sequences differently than the main story line, but by the end of the movie, you're not exactly sure if the whole thing was supposed to be Tim's imagination or real or what? Surely, some people at PETA are going to protest that Puppy Co. dangled puppies from the ceiling. Funny visual though. Lots of anal gags and slapping. The film has lame lines like ""Fart! Poop! Doodie!""  Boss Baby The mother is pregnant, but.??? Interesting lines: ""You can't miss what you haven't had.""  Boss Baby ""Sometimes I rescued my parents; sometimes they rescued me.""  TimFunny lines: ""Cookies are for closers.""  The Boss Baby ""I don't wear nautical.

The positive: the first half was kind of enjoyable. The movie knew what it was and it was dumb but it was fun . The animation is a definite positive of this film.. its beautiful. The negative : The second half becomes serious and it is no longer fun. It becomes very boring by the third act . The voice cast was good enough but it was not a very enjoyable movie as a whole."

Im highly sensitive to hidden messages and symbolism and let me tell you that this movie goes beyond trying to normalize a corporate world. After the intro, i was already sort of bothered by some of the ""humor"" within the scene. I hadnt said a word to my husband about my concern when HE himself looked at me dead faced and said ""there is aaaallloottt of subliminal s*** going on here."" As we continued to watch, one reference after another and even action was just blowing us away. How could any of the creators be OK with this kind of humor thats supposedly aimed at children? Its sickening and down right desensitizing to young minds. There's nothing OK with subliminal messages suggesting sexual acts between a grown a** man in the form of a baby and a prepubescent boy. There really is something going on within the entertainment industry and this movie very well suggests that."
123,The Boss Baby,1,6 August 2017,Filth.......PC Racist Garbage,"PC Racist Garbage.Yet another Hollywood movie that promotes violence against males and is blatantly anti white. This film other then that is boring, creative, and has nothing interesting to say.Anti-male, Anti-Family Hollywood trash."
124,The Boss Baby,10,11 July 2017,Much better than the score,"On reading the negative reviews you'd think this film was well below average, it really isn't. Just watched it with my 3 year old daughter and it is extremely entertaining and laugh out loud funny. Sure you have to suspend your own rationality whilst watching, but isn't that what a lot of films are all about?Yes there's a baby in a suit that arrives by taxi, he talks and is from a corporation in the sky etc etc. But come on, it's a kids animated film d'uh, who knew. I sort of despair about some of the reviewers who can't seem to deal with fantasy based storytelling, perhaps they are so uptight in their own lives and struggle to ""let go"" and enjoy something for its own sake. That or they feel they are like some professional critic/reviewer who has to justify their salary by frequently saying pithy critical comments about something they've seen.All I personally know is that this film deserves a higher score and more balanced reviews from, shall I say, more balanced people."
125,The Boss Baby,8,19 June 2017,Eye-opening,"The target audience for this movie is 18-30 year old young adults. Yes it is a pretty funny cartoon, but I think the main idea here is that people stopped caring. Everyone is so focused on themselves and their careers that they forgot about having kids. Darn, some people say they don't even want any kids because babies are bad. Watch this and then say if the babies are bad or you are just afraid of responsibility.Seriously, if you never considered having kids, watch this."
126,The Boss Baby,9,18 June 2017,A very good animation with interesting ideas,"A very happy family with a single child receives a new baby, one which will steal all the love from his older brother. What the new brother is about to find out is that he's facing with an unusual baby, one which came on a mission and one that must be helped in order to get rid of.It sounds and it actually is fantastic. The two form a pretty good team and their different characters and skills will prove to be highly entertaining and funny. Just to point this aspect out, although it is easily predictable, the film is very well animated and as a bonus point, it has an unique artistic sense when presenting the whole action though the older brother's imagination. The plot is also very well thought, creating a great atmosphere for the ""childish"" events to take place.It's a very good watch, thanks to its characters, plot and animation, the only thing letting it down being the predictability in important moments."
127,The Boss Baby,7,13 June 2017,The Best Boss,"There are a lot of animated movies that are being made in this day and age that essentially cash out on certain things that children love, like farts and cool slang and toys. What I really liked about this movie was while there were some silly portions, the overall movie was very intelligent and funny and also expertly crafted in terms of animation.Boss Baby is the story of a young boy who is getting a new baby brother and is scared that his parents won't love him the same as they used to. This boy has a wild imagination that really lends to some cool scenes where his imagination takes over and the animation changes to fit his mind. Those scenes were by far my favorites in the movie. What ends up happening, though, is instead of a baby brother, he gets Boss Baby. A suit wearing, business lingo talking baby with a hidden agenda who was put at this home to combat the growing rise of puppy love over baby love. See, Boss Baby comes from Baby Corp, a place where certain babies are not meant to be with families, but are meant for management, as the film so hilariously explains it. The crux of the movie is that the other brother wants the Boss Baby gone and the Boss Baby needs to investigate a new puppy that is being announced so they tag team to fulfill each others needs.The script is very sharp and again the animation really sticks out and stays with you after you leave the theater. Much of the movie has you remembering the times you may have had a younger sibling coming into the picture and were worried the same way. The laughs come thick and fast and most of them are from the titular character as Alec Baldwin plays him just as he does with most of his adult roles. The story, while interesting and without spoiling, was an idea I had long before this movie as a business idea (whatever who cares I'll be famous one day doesn't matter), and the typical animated movie formula is in play here so there are not too many major surprises as you watch but I still recommend you watch. It is the perfect family movie or a cute date movie. It is also a great movie for business majors and puppy lovers as well."
128,The Boss Baby,,21 May 2017,One Of The Worst Films To Come Out From DreamWorks Animation Studios' Canon,"What has happened to DreamWorks Animation? Sure it has lived under the shadow of the much successful & far-more influential Pixar Animation Studios throughout its existence but it also had its moments over the years with quality films such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda & How to Train Your Dragon but their recent efforts have been highly mediocre.Take their latest film: The Boss Baby. It not only marks the continuation of the rough phase this animation studio has been going through of lately but is one of their most forgettable films to date. Boring, unimaginative & not at all funny, it's a movie made exclusively for kids and is nothing but a test of patience for the grown-ups accompanying those little rascals.The Boss Baby tells the story of a wildly imaginative 7-year old boy whose perfect life is uprooted when his baby brother shows up. Arriving in a taxi, wearing a suit & carrying a briefcase, this baby is unlike any but when the real identity of the toddler is revealed and his motives are made known, the siblings put their rivalry aside to stop a ridiculous plot from going live.Directed by Tom McGrath, The Boss Baby doesn't waste much time in introducing its ridiculous premise but there isn't one moment when it's able to generate any sort of interest whatsoever and remains dull throughout its runtime. Sure it looks cute, and the animation is rich & colourful but its thinly written plot & poorly sketched characters make sure that it never becomes compelling.Moments that are supposed to be funny appear more stupid than amusing. The humour in itself is so childish that it has negligible effect on the grown-ups. The voice actors chip in with fine inputs but the characters themselves are so bland and devoid of any soul that their work doesn't make much of a difference in the end. Lastly, even Hans Zimmer contributes with a terrible soundtrack.On an overall scale, The Boss Baby is one of the worst films of the year, and is cringeworthy from start to finish. Kids may enjoy it for what it is but they are stupid anyway. The grown-ups, however, will have a hard time, for the plot is going to feel longer than 98 minutes if they're not intrigued by what the film has in store for them. DreamWorks Animations needs to bounce back and someday it definitely will but turds like The Boss Baby certainly won't do it."
129,The Boss Baby,6,18 May 2017,It could've been genius but...,"For an adult, this movie is still entertaining. I thought it was brilliant till one scene if the movie ruined it for me and I was like ""nooooo you stupid bastards!"". Basically the movie is about a kid with a very vivid imagination who lives reality through his imagination l. The script compares segments of reality to segments told to us through his imagination. This includes when the story about the new baby arrival to his life and how the kid thinks the new baby is actually a boss from a corporation somewhere that runs people's lives. I thought this basic idea was genius and was totally enjoying the juxtaposition till the movie decides the kid was dreaming to get out of a dilemma that didn't exist. How else would they bring the baby back into the kid's life unless he was dreaming? Right? Obviously their imagination wasn't as vivid as their character. Couldn't the memory erasing squad come back a day later and reinstall the baby? The part of the story with the nanny, evil boss, chase, rocket, etc., was also one part of ""hollywoodism"" that was completely unnecessary and didn't necessarily add to the movie. It went from a lovely heartwarming story about a kid trying to find in his heart some love for his baby brother and find his new place in a growing family to a ""car chase"" with an evil villain in a bid to save ... yup.. the world. That took the buzz out of the movie and was against all their intents and purposes really boring! There are a few laughs along the way and the script on the whole was good."
130,The Boss Baby,10,9 May 2017,Great Comedy For People Of All Ages,"To be honest, I had my doubts about this movie, but they were all gone once when I set down and started watching it. If you're interesting in watching a great comedy movie for people of all ages, this one's for you, you won't be sorry. I personally love the beginning of the movie, there were couple of scenes with the baby boss that were so hilarious"
131,The Boss Baby,10,3 May 2017,Exceeded my expectations,"I took my two sons to see this moving, fully expecting to be bored out of my mind, but to my surprise I found it very funny especially being a mom to two boys with an 8 year age difference! There is nothing I can think of that would make me want to give this moving anything less than a rating of 10."
132,The Boss Baby,7,1 May 2017,God movie so far,"I don't understand how this movie got so many negative reviews. I went and saw this yesterday and honestly, it's one of the best movies I have EVER seen. The plot is funny and progresses intently while the characters develop and come together in common interest. This movie is hilarious and heartwarming. I 10/10 recommend this. A man named Timothy Templeton (Tobey Maguire) tells a story through his imaginative point of view as his 7-year-old self (Miles Bakshi) who lives his days having fun with his parents, Ted (Jimmy Kimmel) and Janice (Lisa Kudrow). While tucking Tim in bed one night his parents ask if he wanted a baby brother; Tim declines the offer, saying that he is enough. After he goes to sleep, we see that Janice is pregnant.While sleeping Tim begins to wonder where babies come from. One day, Tim is surprised when a business suit-wearing infant shows up in a taxi at his house, and Ted and Janice proudly call him Tim's little brother. Tim is envious of the attention the baby is receiving, not to mention suspicious when the infant acts odd around him, but his parents, being blind to the baby's eccentric behavior, try to convince him that they will grow to love each other.Soon, Tim learns that the baby can talk like an adult (Alec Baldwin) and he introduces himself as ""The Boss Baby"". Tim decides to record a conversation between him and other toddlers who are over at Tim's house for a meeting to do something about how puppies are receiving more love than babies. The Boss Baby and the other infants catch Tim with the recording and after a chase scene throughout the backyard and the house, the tape is terminated after The Boss Baby threatens to tear up Tim's favorite stuffed animal, Lam-Lam. With no evidence to support him, Tim is subsequently grounded by his parents for his actions during the chase between him and the Boss baby.The Boss Baby comes to Tim and has him suck on a pacifier that transports them to Baby Corp, a place where infants with adult-like minds work to preserve infant love everywhere. They are virtual, so they cannot be seen or heard. The Boss Baby explains to Tim that he was sent on a mission to see why puppies are getting more love than infants. He has infiltrated Tim's residence because his parents work for Puppy Co., which is unleashing a new puppy on the day that employees take their children to work. The Boss Baby also explains that he stays intelligent by drinking a ""Secret Baby Formula"" which enables a baby to act like an adult. However, if a baby does not drink it after a period of time, he or she reverts to a regular baby. He hopes to receive a promotion after dealing with Puppy Co.'s new puppy, but when they overhear Boss Baby's boss threaten to fire him for not bringing in information, thereby stranding him at the Templetons, he and Tim agree to work together to keep that from happening.After appearing to have patched things up, Tim's parents lift the grounding and take them to Puppy Co. for ""take your child to work day"". While there, they slip away and find what they think is the plans for a ""Forever Puppy"", but it turns out to be a trap set by founder Francis E. Francis . They discover that Francis used to be the head of Baby Corp. and Boss Baby's idol, but was forced out when it was discovered that his lactose intolerance kept the secret formula from working properly. Vowing revenge, Francis founded Puppy Corp. and intends to have the Forever Puppies overshadow babies by stealing Boss Baby's serum bottle and infecting the puppies with it. Tim's parents go with Francis to Las Vegas, and Francis has his brother Eugene pose as Tim and Boss Baby's babysitter to keep them from interfering.Without a steady flow of serum to keep his intelligence in check, Boss Baby begins reverting back to being a normal baby. Despite this, he and Tim manage to evade the ""babysitter"" long enough to get to the airport, but are too late to intercept Tim's parents. Upset, Tim blames Boss Baby for using his family for his own ulterior motives, for which Boss Baby, after some hesitance, apologizes. After that, they went to airplane and come to Las Vegas.Furious at their interference, Francis proceeds to lock Tim's parents up so he can burn them with exhaust from a rocket used to launch the Forever Puppies. Tim and Boss Baby fight with him, and then push him into the formula. Boss Baby opens the rocket to let the dogs out, so they can save Tim's parents. After he successfully does that, he returns to baby state while still on the rocket, but Tim sings to him with a family song to show his appreciation, causing him to jump off of the rocket before it launches. Francis, having reverted back to baby form, attempts to attack them again, but Eugene interferes, stating he'll ""raise him right this time"" now that he's a baby again.Boss Baby gets promoted, leaves in a taxi, and Tim goes back to being an only child. But Tim and Boss Baby, having grown closer, start to miss each other. Boss Baby, fed up, decides to be part of the Templeton family permanently. He returns to the Templeton family as a regular baby named Theodore Lindsey, as the whole story turned out to be in Tim's imagination, and Ted and Janice have just brought him home from the hospital. Tim is now an adult and now the father of an older daughter and an infant daughter who acts exactly like Theodore did when he was Boss Baby."
133,The Boss Baby,10,1 May 2017,An Excellent Movie .,"An excellent movie is a movie that you could see over and over again, not a movie that wins a Oscar, or a movie that makes a lot of money. It's a movie that you personally can watch over and over again. The Boss Baby, to me, is a measure of an excellent movie. And I would watch it again."
134,The Boss Baby,7,29 April 2017,Very pleased with my son's reaction to the film,"I went to see this movie with my six-year old son. He has a baby sister and is rather familiar with sibling jealousy. While watching the film I thought that it was only slightly better than terrible because the story line was too complex for kids and too boring for adults. Moreover, my son felt pretty scared during a few episodes, which was quite contrary to my expectations, too. However, after we left the theater, he said that he had enjoyed the movie. He added that he was happy his sister was not a baby boss and that he loved her very much. As soon as we returned home, my son hugged and kissed our baby daughter. And before going to bed he said he wanted her to sleep with him in his room. So apparently the creators of this film got something right after all."
135,The Boss Baby,5,28 April 2017,"Fun, inconsistency and confusion","The Boss Baby, new animated movie from DreamWorks Animation, has a very star heavy casting crew, with the likes of Alec Baldwin, Toby Maguire, Steve Buscemi, Jimmy kimmel and Lisa Kudrow. As always, animations was great. Lots of jokes and fun. It showed some good point from the perspective of a child. But, yet this movie felt a little flat for me. After watching this, I ended up with lots of plot-holes and confusions. This film has too many inconsistency. To me, It's just another film, that I've watched, and will forget about it in very short time. If you want some mindless fun and laughter, this is perfect for you. It's perfect for kids. Lots of cheap jokes and charisma. Good movie to blow off some steam. If, you are a family man, try watching it with wife and kids. For, something good and memorable, you can skip this one."
136,The Boss Baby,4,19 April 2017,"Despite a Few Inspired Moments, This Baby Never Grows Into Something Greater","Seven-year-old Tim is crestfallen when his idyllic family unit is shattered by a shrewd, suit-wearing, latte-draining infant brother with ulterior motives. It's a silly-thin premise, really, even for a kids' movie, but one that has a few ups to go with its downs. It's very well art-directed, for one, with Tim's wildly colorful, elaborate fantasies wrenched to life in a variety of rich, vibrant, mix-and-match styles. Sight gags are also a strength, in true Dreamworks fashion, with one absurdly over-the-top backyard brawl taking that particular cake. The celebrity voice acting is hit and miss: Alec Baldwin is a home run as the titular toddler, but Jimmy Kimmel drags down an essential role as the boys' soulful, stretched-thin father. The story, too, grapples with big problems. It makes a nasty habit of establishing supporting characters and then forgetting about them for an awkward length of time, and also suffers from long stretches of bland exposition that drag the plot to a standstill. Though it strives to connect with audiences of all ages, spitting adult-directed one-liners and references at every opportunity, many feel forced and out of place, like the obnoxious uncle who keeps trying to work in a ""that's what she said"" at the family picnic. Simple, narrow and predictable to the last, it'll make good fodder for early weekend mornings, in households where sleepy parents seek something loud and shiny to sleep through."
137,The Boss Baby,,11 April 2017,You'll smile but won't crack up laughing,"The movie has some scenes that will make you smile slightly, but you won't crack up laughing. There were some children also at the cinema's room and neither of them laughed uncontrollably as children usually do when they enjoy a movie a lot. If you got some free time and don't mind spending some dollars, go ahead; otherwise, I'm sure there are better options to spend your money in."
138,The Boss Baby,5,1 April 2017,Alec Baldwin is a baby!,"The Boss Baby is the latest animated film by Dreamworks. It stars Alec Baldwin as the movie's title character. It's about an intelligent baby who is sent to the Timpleton family to stop an evil company called Puppy Co from terminating the attention of babies. Along the way, he will have to deal with his big brother Timothy Timpleton.I'm gonna be honest, I had no high expectations going in. I saw this as just a stupid movie that was made passable to kids. In the end, my initial thoughts kind of made sense since the entire theater was full of kids.With that being said, this movie is definitely passable for kids.My main issue with the movie is that it overall makes very little sense. I'm probably not the only one to say or think that it's a confusing movie with a confusing story and a confusing concept. There are many plot points that don't make sense. There are concepts that don't make sense. For example, the parents don't seem to hear the babies talking while they're having their little meeting; that's not a spoiler, it's in the trailer. Is this supposed to be some Rugrats thing where the parents can't hear the babies speaking? Aside from the nonsensicalness of the movie, there is the comedy. The comedy helps reinforce the fact that I think the movie is passable for kids as most of the humor is very lowbrow. Were there any good jokes in the movie? Well, I had a few laughs here and there, so yeah, there was a little bit of good comedy.The animation style looks very subpar, to the point where I questioned if this was supposed to be put into theaters originally. It's not bad animation though, it just has a style that is way too cartoony, and with CGI animation, there is a line between cartoony and realistic animation that should stay around the middle-ish area. However, what I can give the animation style props for is how it shows us the perspective of Tim in various creative ways. I really love this style change and it's the saving grace of the animation style.As for some of the goods, the animation, while the style is subpar, it can look pretty creative. Even if it looks nonsensical, such as the tower that you will see later on in the film. I've already talked about the way the animation is used to show the perspective of a kid. Something I loved about the movie has to be the development of the characters. I don't wanna get into much because it'll eventually lead into spoiler territory, but it goes along with the message regarding brotherhood and dealing with siblings.Overall, I thought this movie was pretty mediocre. On one hand it has a mixed animation style, nonsensical story and concept. On another, it has a strong message that can be taken away by the end. I do think that kids will really enjoy it for its humor, even if it can be lowbrow. Others may also like it and some may consider it to be a guilty pleasure of theirs. I don't think it's on the levels of Shark Tale bad, just mediocre. However, it did come very close to getting a 4 from me..."
139,The Boss Baby,5,29 April 2017,"Bad, but funny","The boss baby, where can I begin, well let's start with the plot of the movie. The plot is about this boy named Tim who lives a happy life with his family, however a new baby comes to the family, and this baby turns out to be a business man that's against a corporation of puppies, so now the two brothers have to work together in order to discover their new plan: Forever puppy. Now let's get to the Pros: So the pros where, the humor, I really thought the humor was pretty funny, plus, the voice acting is pretty good too, plus, that fat baby (who is one of the boss baby's employees) his moments were the best in the whole movie, plus, the animation was OK. Now lets get to the Cons: So the Cons where it's plot, the plot in here is really lazy, but I'll one by one, first, there's the ""Person lived happy with his family, but a new person comes and steels the attention the person got"" plot, which is obviously recycled from Toy Story, also, let's hop into the beginning of the movie where we got the ""Where do babies come from"" plot, which is recycling the plot from Storks, it also has the ""Babies talk and live in this world of grown ups"" plot, which recycles the plot from Rugrats, we also got the""We work at an office"" which recycles the plot from the TV show The Office, now lets analyze the villain of the movie Francis Francis, and we learned that he is the boss baby's hero, but now he's a bad guy, which that's for UP, where Charles Muntz was Carl's hero, but he turns into the bad guy, it's the same here, another con were the parents of the movie, I mean seriously, they care more about the new guy instead of the first one, now I know this also happened with other people, but these parents are different, first off, they don't care that the baby cares a suitcase or wheres a suit, they don't think that's weird, they are all fine with that, another con was when the dad sad to Tim that the new baby needs all the attention, after hearing that sentence, I kinda thought that was mean spirited, and another con is that this movie is trying to be a cartoon, and what do I mean by that is because this thing of magic formula that babies drink just came out of nowhere with no explanation on how they did that. In the end, I thought this was bad, but it did have some funny moments. So that was my review of The Boss Baby, again, i didn't hate it, but for a studio like Dreamworks, is obviously that they can do better, hopefully Captain Underpants be good, because if it doesn't, then I'll say to Dreamworks that they completely have a problem."
140,The Boss Baby,10,25 November 2017,Unexpectedly Great Movie,"I Was not expecting this to be a good movie but it was indeed. It was very creative and was full of laughs..Loved it!! The animation is amazing.It delivered a good message in a unique way, through a kid with a great imagination perspective. this is a must see movie to watch with the entire family."
141,The Boss Baby,6,19 July 2017,The Boss Baby,"Holy crap another movie adaptation of a children's book, picture book. This has to be one of the most bizarre premises I've come across for a children's book in some time, well at least until the end where all is somewhat explained.So basically you've got this family of three, mum dad and their little boy Tim. Tim is as happy as can be with his life because he gets lots of love and attention from his parents. But things take a turn for the worst when his mum and dad have a baby. Much to Tim's amazement the baby arrives in a taxi, wears a suit, and he can talk. Almost straight away the baby throws Tim's life into disarray without his parents noticing.It turns out that the baby (called 'the boss') is actually a baby but works for a mysterious company called Baby Corp. Here all babies have the minds of adults and work to keep infant love at a good level. Basically when people are born some are sent to their families but others that show a different state of mind are held back to work for Baby Corp, or something like that. These adult minded babies have to drink a special formula that keeps them as babies forever, if they stop they will grow old. Meanwhile, all other babies that go to their families, do retain memories of Baby Corp though their pacifier (dummy). But when that pacifier is eventually taken away (by the parents) they lose those memories. Utterly bizarre I know.This premise raises many questions though. Does this mean that all the babies in Baby Corp are immortal? Surely it does because if they never stop drinking the formula they never grow older. Where is Baby Corp suppose to be exactly? When a baby is held back to work for Baby Corp, what happens with the family expecting that baby? Its also mentioned at one point by Tim that his parents told him where babies come from. But as Boss baby points out that is incorrect, so how come adults have never noticed the fact that no one gives birth? I guess you could say I'm reading into this too much, but these questions do kinda spring out at you.Lets look at the villain. This guy used to be one of Baby Corps top babies, but apparently he was lactose intolerant so the special formula didn't work properly on him and he grew up. OK fair enough, but how come he can still remember Baby Corps? I thought babies lose that memory without their pacifier. Was it different for him because he used to be a CEO of Baby Corp or because he had been using the special formula or something??I must admit the plot behind this movie was way more convoluted than I ever imagined. I just assumed it would be about a baby that acts like an adult behind its parents backs, kinda like an animated 'Look Who's Talking' type thing. I mean the casting of Alec Baldwin was a good move that's for sure. If there's anyone who has the perfect temperament for being a suit trapped in a babies body, its Alec Baldwin. Hell Baldwin is intimidating enough just by looking at his face, he constantly has that angry dad expression on his face, the scary boss with a short fuse. So spot on voice casting there.Visually the movie is a treat but that's nothing new these days. But what I did find more interesting were the short imagination sequences that Tim has when he's playing. These sequences had a different, more simplified artistic style (kinda reminiscent of some old WB cartoons) with a much more vibrant, almost neon, colour palette. It was these sequences that I found to be way more intriguing and enjoyable than the rest of the actual movie. I especially liked the artistic style and colours used, really bold and striking. Other positive moments I can mention, a nice little 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' homage, and even more bizarrely a homage to the old classic kids board game 'Mouse Trap' (80's kids will know of this). Where on earth did that come from??So yeah, its pretty to look at, the voice acting is solid and its amusing in places. I liked it when Tim was battling with the baby, from his parents point of view its seeing the duo merely playing, but its actually a battle. The sequence in the back garden with the pedal car is the perfect example of that. In general its a very average outing really (with a peculiar plot). A standard modern CGI kids flick with all the right boxes ticked.6/10"
142,The Boss Baby,10,18 July 2017,I love the boss (BABY) :),"i have watched the movie ""THE BOSS BABY""... :) and it was VERY FUNNY!! the funnest part was about it that the baby is the boss. actually in the real life babys are not the boss... BUT IN THIS MOVIE THE BABY WAS THE BOSS!?! haha this is my favourite movie of the year even better then despiclabel me 3 even though i think the minions are funny.. but the boss baby is better. :) :) :) no one beats The Boss after all :) 10000000/10 :) overalll great movie about the boss babyfun: 10/10 animation computer 10/10 bossyness 100/10 :p boring 0/10 IT WAS not :)watch this with your friends who will love the goofy boss baby so much."
143,The Boss Baby,10,16 July 2017,Beautiful Film,"The boss baby will definitely go down as one of my favourite Animation movies ever. It was funny, sad and all around entertaining. I would definitely watch it again. The dialogue was impeccable and the animation was divine. The characters were hilarious and the sound track made me cry. I would definitely recommend the boss baby to everyone of all ages. It was amazing."
144,The Boss Baby,5,15 July 2017,I wish you've never been born,"Tim is an only child who loves being an only child. He has an over active imagination. When the new baby arrives by cab and in a suit, Tim has questions and doesn't like the attention the baby gets, believing he is being deprived of love...not the best family message out there. However, the baby was sent from Baby Corp (in heaven?) to investigate the new puppy being introduced as puppies have replaced babies as being loved the most. Tim's parents are marketers for Puppyco. Message: Lovable designer dogs-bad.Of course in the end Tim and baby bond and love each other, but there were some pains getting there. I guess I am the only person who heard this, but when the baby is first discovered he says something that sounds like""' F-word' who doey."" It was quick but clear and distinctive. I am not sure what Dreamworks is trying to pull.Hearing Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin as the Boss Baby and say ""You're Fired"" didn't bring things home. The movie had some entertaining scenes for the kids and even adults, but I would recommend parents see the film first before they let their kids view it. While the over all message is designed to be positive, that might not be what a child might take away."
145,The Boss Baby,6,12 July 2017,A couple of levels of reading!,"Baby Boss is fun enough. Not crazy about the design of the characters, the very hectic editing and, fundamentally, the whole ""puppy vs baby"" premise is disturbing but, despite all this, the movie is entertaining and not torture to watch at all. The main reason is Alec Baldwin; he's just fun as this CEO baby character. It just clicks. And ; more importantly, it works if you think about his SNL President parody: One can't help but draw parallels when the baby plays golf in a middle of a meeting etc etc. So, maybe I'm reading too much into this, but the parallel with present day important people adds another level of interpretation... and fun! to this movie."
146,The Boss Baby,6,7 June 2017,Not What I had Hoped,"I'm not going to lie to you on this one, I didn't hold much hope for it being a good movie. I'm pretty sure I was correct in my thinking. That being said it wasn't a terrible movie, it's just something that I can't see people liking too much.The movie is 97 minutes long (1h 37min) and I think it is too drawn out. This is a movie that I checked how much time was left on three separate occasions to see when I would be done watching it. This is clearly from the view point of an adult and not a child, but I am also a huge animation buff. I love cartoon anything as long as there is a good story involved. Children would like this movie because it is animated, it has children in it and silly moments. I can't help but feel like an animated movie classified as family, has to have something for the adults, that will ultimately be watching with children. That is where I think this movie falls flat. I hope that makes sense. As for the voice actors, they each did a great job. Clearly they are professionals and they play their parts well. You have Alec Baldwin playing the Boss Baby, who is meant to be a businessman so he fits perfectly. The protagonist is Steve Buscemi, playing Francis Francis. The mother and father are played by Lisa Kudrow and Jimmy Kimmel, respectively. Lastly in the big name category you have the brother Tim, and narrator being played by Tobey Maguire.Lets hear about the plot. I think it is a bit all over the place and they tried to jam too much into it, without developing most of it fully. It really had promise, but missed the mark for me. Anyway, this movie starts out with a happy family of three. Through the eyes of the creative child everything is perfect. One day a baby brother shows up wearing a suit and carrying a brief case. The older brother Tim sees this as odd and suspects that his new baby brother is up to something. He finds out that his brother is really a baby in management sent by Baby Corp, to dig up dirt about the company that Tim's parents work for, Puppy Co. The basis is that Babies and puppies are competitors, fighting for the majority share of love available in the world. Seems like a great concept that didn't go into great detail. The rest of the movie is about how the two pair up to stop the plan of the Puppy Co. CEO. Along they way their relationship grows, and evolves.I thought that they should have played more on theme of the creative child, Tim's, view of the baby coming into the lives of their family and playing the part of the ""boss"", by being so demanding as an infant and needing all of the attention. They did portray it but didn't develop it. It would have been neat if only through the eyes of Tim, we saw the baby in a suit. But sadly, he was just seen as a baby in a suit the whole time. It didn't really make sense. There are other times where only Tim knew what was going on and only he saw certain sides of Boss Baby, and that I liked. The movie seemed a bit too jumbled for me and it really didn't have anything for the older audience. this movie is still cute and well made, production wise. It will catch the eye and mind of some people just not everyone. I also have to disagree with it being placed in the genre of comedy as well. It really isn't funny, its cute, there is a difference. It has its silly moments but nothing to make you laugh out loud.To wrap it up the actors are great, and they should be. The production is great like it should be. The plot is there but, the themes are under developed. The audience for this movie would be children under the age of 12, which it is being rated as PG. There is nothing to keep the adults attention. This movie would be great to put on your TV and do house work while your kids watch it alone.**Disclaimer, before my rating let me list other movies that it is up against in the same genres**All listed with at least two of the three same genres, followed by their IMDb.com rating:Sing: 7.2The LEGO Batman Movie: 7.5Cars: 7.1Moana: 7.7Zootopia: 8.1The Lion King: 8.5Finding Dory: 7.4Toy Story: 8.3When you make a movie in these genres you are going up against the greats, and instant classics. That all being said I was not impressed with this movie, and for the genres that it is placed in I would give this movie a 5.9/10"
147,The Boss Baby,,31 May 2017,A child coping with a miscarriage?,"I wanted to write this review mainly because I hadn't seen anyone write anything about this and wanted to see if anybody else saw this or if it was just my effed up mind.At the beginning of the movie we see the mother pregnant when asking Tim whether he'd like a baby brother. So right there we get a hint that in this films universe baby's are indeed conceived and born in the traditional sense, not made by this company in the clouds. Then when the taxi arrives and out step his grief stricken parents, who had lost the baby, Tim creates this Boss baby with his vivid imagination as a coping mechanism to deal with the loss of his baby brother. As we had previously seen he has an amazing imagination and makes up this crazy story about Boss baby's and Forever puppy's. The scenes where he is ignored by his parents because they spend all their time on the new baby is just how he sees it but in reality they are depressed because of the miscarriage.In the end we get a happy ending though, his parents have another baby and he loves his new baby brother because of what had happened in his imaginary story.Just wanted to put a new twist on this movie. Overall it wasn't a bad movie, a few chuckles here and the and some good animation, might even watch it again sometime."
148,The Boss Baby,4,31 May 2017,There are 1001 better animated movie than this one. Not entirely worth your time but children may like it.,"'THE BOSS BABY' was directed by Tom McGrath and stars Alec Baldwin, Tobey Maguire and Steve Buscemi. ​When his new baby brother comes into Tim(Tobey Maguire)'s life, wearing a sharp suit and tie, Tim feels there is something wrong with him and desperately tries to prove to his Mum(Lisa Kudrow) and Dad(Jimmy Kimmel) that there is something wrong. But as evens unfold, he sees that things are not as they seem.My expectations for this movie were lower than low. From the trailers, I thought this movie would be one of the worst movies of this year. After seeing it, I was half right. It isn't a good movie but I don't see it as particularly bad. Kids will definitely enjoy it, there is no doubt about that so if you want a harmless thing to let your kids watch, they'll be occupied for 90 minutes but aside from that, I just don't recommend it. Movies like 'Toy Story', 'The Iron Giant' and even 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King' have proved we can have stellar animated movies that appeal for both children and adults so I naturally assume that most competent animated movies will attempt to appease both. With the exception of some funny movie references, this movie provides very, very little for more mature audiences to enjoy. The moral is only for children and doesn't have much(if any) appeal to adults. If you're a parent who wants to relax for an hour, your kids will probably be entertained but if you don't fall into that category, I don't recommend it.Not to say that animated movies need a stellar story, but this movie was pathetically predictable. Great movies can be predictable but they need to at least try to stand out from the pack. I'd argue the rough concept of this movie is similar to 'Storks' from last year and that the morals presented are nothing original either. On top of that, if you claim the ending of this movie is surprising or 'touching', you really need to watch more movies. I predicted that before the movie was even on.Alec Baldwin was, to be fair to him, pretty great as 'The BOSS Baby' and made this movie watchable. Both Tobey Maguire and Steve Buscemi did fine in the supporting cast but that is this movie's primary flaw. Everything is just fine. Very little stands out and is great but by the same comparison, very little is outwardly bad or frustrating. It's just kind of average. None of the characters are particularly memorable and just exist to hurry the plot along.As far as animation goes, this movie is pretty nice to look at. It's nothing special or anything, and I could have done without the annoying eyes, but it's perfectly passable and won't take you out of the movie too much. It tries to be more cartoony that realistic and takes plenty of liberties as such so it's perfectly enjoyable for children to look at but isn't anything too impressive because who actually puts effort into animated movies? They're just for kids, right?I will say I laughed around about 5 times in this movie and all of those times were purely because of movie references. So if it's not THAT funny and doesn't have a great story/cast of characters, what does it have going for it? I'll say it has a good heart. While the story is pretty predictable and I cannot see many adults enjoying this, it's a perfectly disposable film that will entertain kids and perhaps even offer them a moral lesson. Aside from that, I can't say I recommend it. I'll rate it a 4 out of 10 bottles of milk."
149,The Boss Baby,10,29 May 2017,Watched it before my kid did,"Deserves better ratings, that's for sure. Was entertaining, funny, emotional, everything that an animation is supposed to be. And i'm gonna watch it again with my kid.My nephews already saw it and laughed so hard and they're gonna watch it again with us. I want more! This is good animation, not all that stuff on TV nowadays(spongebob,cow&chicken,etc)"
150,The Boss Baby,8,27 May 2017,Stewie Already Did It,"What cute baby. Oh, yes you are. Cuuuutie baby! Egad!It's gotta be tough for animators these days. Especially for those not employed by Disney/Pixar. Appealing to toddlers, kids, young adults and adults with an original story and take on an animated featureBut, The Boss Baby handled it in spades. Sure, if you put Stewie and this Boss Baby in opposite corners, only Stewie would emerge as the victor, at least we got more of Alec Baldwin as the antihero we all know he is.Basically, the only-child of a triangle family is threatened by a newborn that plans on world-business-dominance and if they don't stop a convenient-plot-villain subplot together, they will be orphans. Or worseWhat's nice about this movie/story is that it's not trying to win an Oscar®. It's not trying to out-Indiana Jones the competition. It's what it is: a fun, deep and funny animated feature to entertain and never take from the competition. Just have fun, laugh a lot and be entertained as planned.Okay, maaaaybe, it should be for a little older crowd. There's a bunch of humor and innocent nudity that the younger kids wouldn't like, don't need to see or understand. I guess this is what separates The Boss Baby from The FamilyPixar.***Final thoughts: Though he's gonna be known soon for the bestest Cheeto impersonator, Alec, here, made me just want to rewatch one of my favorite action films: Mission: Impossible  Rogue Nation. Every time I heard his voice, I thought of the Tom Cruise franchise and wanted to pop that in. Too bad THAT's what I know him as and not the truth behind Cheeto or any of the other great works he's associated with."
151,The Boss Baby,8,23 May 2017,I Love This One!,"Imagine if you have a baby brother like that, I mean WOW right! if having a baby brother like that I could sick with his crying. Because he take your parents away from you, but as you know! you will love him when having a chance to prove yourself to the baby brother that you loved him with all of your heart, because ""There's plenty of love for everyone""."
152,The Boss Baby,8,23 May 2017,A nicely done animation,"It is extremely dis-heartening to see a neatly produced film like The Boss Baby receiving as low as 6.3 in the IMDb ratings when a comparatively shallower and gimmicky film like The Beauty and The Beast(2017) scores 7.6. One wonders whether the quality of viewership is witnessing a steady decline, favoring spectacle over sense of aesthetics and intellect. The Boss Baby is if not excellent, a consistently good piece of cinema which keeps you engaged and entertained without being sensational..."
153,The Boss Baby,10,23 May 2017,Great and Awesome movie,"the movie was awesome.I really enjoyed watching this film.The movie is absolutely hilarious and heart warming.The characters which are used in this movie are also awesome.this is the best movie ever made.Great movie fr d kids above the age of 6, bet 12. Strongly recommend watching Boss Baby.."
154,The Boss Baby,6,22 May 2017,A Kid's Movie that Makes fun of Adults,"Tim Templeton is a typical 7 year old kid. He has two loving parents who give him all the attention that a child at this age deserves. However, that dynamic changes when another baby arrives on the scene. This baby is unlike most other babies. This ""boss baby"", voiced by Alec Baldwin of 30 Rock royalty, is truly the man. He shows up everywhere in a posh suit and seems to have everything figured out from people management to the stock market. The baby was born with a knack for business that would put your average adult business executives to shame.Any parent or sibling that has experienced the rivalry that often develops when the original family dynamic is disrupted by a newborn can relate to this touching and heartfelt film. Tim's baby brother is at first grossly condescending and businesslike. He steals away Tim's parents and their attention which fuels a hilarious rivalry between the two. Although the film is clearly a kid's film, there are plenty of small jokes that only adults would understand. Quips like, ""Ugh, the people of long island do not know how to make an iced tea!"" are sure to please the adults in the audience. Ultimately, after many failed attempts at getting rid of his brother, Tim hatches a scheme that takes advantage of his baby brother's competitive spirit. Tim strikes a deal with the baby where he assists him in getting the promotion he wants in Baby Corp, in exchange for sole custody of their parent's attention. The baby agrees.Fortunately, this common purpose and the wild journey that follows ends up uniting the two siblings and a strong bond develops culminating in everybody finally accepting their place in the family. It is very natural for a sibling to feel the need to compete with a newborn. Tim's baby brother dilemma is universal and can be familiar to both parents and children everywhere trying to find their place in the world."
155,The Boss Baby,8,22 May 2017,b movie,"Tim is living the perfect life with his parents until, a mysterious baby come at his door and take all the attention from him, to get the attention back, Tim needs to co-operate with the baby so he can accomplish his secret mission and leave Tim with his parent alone.The story was showing how a family is important and what one could feel when he loses what he have. Voicing, were amazing Alec Baldwin, Steve Buscemi, and Miles Bakshi did great job in the film. Graphics were amazing and colorful and songs too are good."
156,The Boss Baby,6,20 May 2017,"So flawed, yet decent","This film is pretty good. The story isn't half bad, the CGI is great, and the voice casting is great as well. The story itself is actually pretty good. It's a little dull, random, and choppy, but it goes on a decent enough flow for it to be enjoyable. The CGI done in this film is great and well detailed. The voice actors did very well in their rolls. All in all, this film is awesome for the most part. The other problem with this film other than the story being somewhat flawed is the premise. The premise in this film is pretty lackluster. This film also has some unanswered questions. One question is why did the baby wear the suit when he came home? I understand that he was put in a suit when he was down the assembly line, but I just don't understand how he has it on. Was he wearing it when he was born? Another question is that if he was put under management, how come he was born into a family? Shouldn't he be working with the other management babies? This film can sometimes not make sense. Other than all that, this film isn't bad, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a cute, fun, goofy film that will entertain most children of all ages. Though it may not at all be DreamWorks best, it's certainly not the worst."
157,The Boss Baby,10,20 May 2017,Take as a Future Warning,well when this movie came with Ghost in the shell both released in same day i thought Ghost in the shell will dominate the Box office well everything just turned The Boss Baby Dominated the Box office and here i get it why just so beautiful movie and something unique and a special way to realize about present world about their love through your puppy getting bigger as compare to your kids well i don't think it's really happening in present days not in my region but maybe somewhere but in future it can be happen everywhere. Dreamarts present this is too funny specially the kid just think a kid as a Boss it's almost a joke to think kid as a boss in here in whole movie you gonna see how's he reacting in everything and making you a lot fun really a good movie.
158,The Boss Baby,7,29 April 2017,I liked it actually,As everyone know this is the kind of movie for kids or kids at heart like me. Nothing much new about the flow of the story compare to most if not all all of the animated movis I have watched which is not bad at all. As someone who is 23 years old I actually liked the movie and the main idea or conflict in the movie is unfortunately reflects to what most people think these days which is scary. So if you picking a movie alone or with someone or with family with any age I think this is a good choice. It always nice to bring back the child part of us once in a while.
159,The Boss Baby,10,28 April 2017,Best movie ever,For a animated film this movie is very cute and very funny. This has to be the best animated film I ever saw to date. It is very well made and is a must see. You all better see it now before it leaves the theaters. It will make you laugh and cry. It is a feel good movie for all ages. This baby means business.
160,The Boss Baby,,28 April 2017,Sauce,"""Get lost in the sauce"" my mother always told me, but alas I HAD NO SAUCE TO GET LOST IN. then ONE AFTERNOON I SAW THE TRAILER FOR ""Boss Baby"" And i got a head rush. I had to see this movie, i saw it once, and had to end up giving up most of my possessions in a yard sale because I ended up accumulating the total $50.7 million in the box office the first day. God this movie is a classic. My only complaint was no Adam Sandler, as he is a comedy genius. But that is my review 10/10"
