0,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,30 October 2013,Cute-sy and punny...not bad actually,I found the first movie unique and fun...the second was a bit less surprising but it was saved by the puns hahaSome of course might not like the lines but for me it was funny when needed :D Everything was cute of course and was perfect for its intended audience (I watched this with at least 100 kids in the theaters...and all of them loved it..so much giggles and kid noise) I was happy they didn't put much romance on it a hint as with the first movie but not overpowering to make it romanticStoryline- hm well of course it is predictable and there aren't twist and turns you just know this will happen..it's a kids movie it should be simple with bright colors and lovable cute charactersand Cloudy 2 gave that.
1,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,,21 October 2013,So disappointing,"I'm resigned to the fact that ""0 out of 124 people"" will find the following review useful (in the world of IMDb, dissenting opinions are usually regarded as useless - quite odd, as I always enjoy reading reviews that challenge my thoughts on a film). Anyway, here goes: If the original Cloudy was like one of those Heston Blumenthal dishes that's both outrageously odd and utterly brilliant - I don't know, perhaps fried egg with jam and Rice Krispies - then this misguided, saccharine sequel is a pointless pudding, an overly sweet dessert that makes you sick up a bit of the main course.Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) lands a job with a shady corporation run by his childhood hero - funny how he wasn't mentioned in the first film - who decides to send Flint back to his home island for the post-first-film clean-up, whilst playing him off against his friends. The island itself is now inhabited by living beings made of food, including a cute little strawberry with the voice of Eric Cartman, a spider comprising Big Mac and fries, and a taco-dile that spits vegetables everywhere. Are you sure this script is ready? The problem, no doubt, is that Phil Lord and Chris Miller were only on hand to provide the story and exec-produce, with former South Park staffer Erica Rivinoja botching the writing job, and Cody Cameron (Shrek, Madagascar) and Cloudy contributor Kris Pearn taking care of the rest.There are a few good jokes - the fishing trip, the translation, Steve the monkey generally - but it's largely overbearing sentiment, food creatures with punny names (essentially a Twitter hashtag that got out of hand), and Steve Jobs-based villainy, a sort of Robots/Wreck-It Ralph/Jurassic Park III hybrid, with a minimum of heart, wit and invention. I wanted something as anarchic and genuinely original as the first movie. Instead, I got a film that's not only aimed at kids, but doggedly conventional, and insultingly predictable, both in its re-treading of old ground and its telegraphing of old jokes.It's the most disappointing movie I've seen for a couple of years at least."
2,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,4,25 October 2013,Animation is good but it's a sequel  that wasn't really needed,"'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2' was yet another sequel to be released in 2013. The first one was a good solid animated film, not the best but it was different and I liked it. I didn't watch this with high expectations because the 1st one was just a good 7/10.As in the first film, the animation is excellent with lots of bright colours etc. Characters are well designed just the same as the 1st. Everything looks good. The voices are mostly the same but it's a shame Mr.T didn't return to voice Earl Devereaux.There are some funny moments throughout the film but the storyline in general just wasn't as good as the 1st. The original setting has changed because Flint's machine is still running and the town is being over run with food-animal hybrids. This was just a bit silly in general and didn't have the magic of the 1st film.Overall it was just a bit unnecessary and a sequel that wasn't really needed. The title could've been more imaginative as well. I found it to be much like 'Despicable Me 2' where it was OK to watch for the 1st hour but then I was getting bored where it was just tedious. It's OK for a one time watch but the first one is definitely better. I'm sure the youngsters will enjoy it but the first one was more of a film that all ages could at least enjoy in full.Also if Chester V is Flint's hero, why wasn't this mentioned in the first film? 5/10."
3,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,4,12 October 2013,Disappointing Sequel,"I was so excited for this sequel because I love Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs especially Flint and I didn't like any of the characters very much in this film. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 was a dumb film with too much drama and stupidity. Flint is not very smart anymore and his voice is also super annoying. The characters are not very happy in the film, Flint's stupidity and clumsiness has caused chaos and got him looking deeply sad and crying a bit. There is also potty humor in this film as well, with the underwear. Flint is also curious, naive, not very talkative, and doesn't have a very big personality. See, this film didn't capture much of the magic of the first film. It's like the people that made this film has lost their intelligence and do not know how underrated the first film was.This film actually had some pretty good and interesting parts moreso in the beginning before he started crying about something of his personality that has like completely ruined the whole point of the films. Flint's dad sung a silly song and the music in this film was also silly.This film was a waste of time, I suggest you avoid it, it's nothing really special. I came home thinking the film would be more exciting and better if they had thought of better ideas.The only part of the film I can say was decent was the animation, which was very close to the original.I couldn't follow the storyline, it had a lot of plot holes and lame stuff.This whole film was like annoying and unnecessary."
4,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,11 October 2013,Fruitful Revisit,"2009's Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was based on a beloved book that turns out to be a really good and undeniably endearing adaptation, and that's satisfying enough for us to live without any sequel of it. But here it is, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, a film that gives Flint Lockwood and the gang an extra journey to this whimsical world. And surprisingly, it turns out to be all fun with wonderful animation and some memorable humor, especially when it involves puns. It's still extravagant for it to have a sequel, but if you're hungry for more of these delightful characters and their preposterous adventures, then this film is a worthwhile treat.The main plot itself is immediately stale, focusing on that point gives the film a hint of tastelessness. There's even hardly any meat to its subtext which it rather mixes its random messages; it started with the childhood idol trouble clich√©, then to Flint's relationship issues to his father and friends, and eventually tells an environmental friendly story. There's also an irony at the third message that the fact the animals, which are made of food, shouldn't be harmed, but eating sardines is fine. I understand what kind of analogy they're pulling off here, but then it gets a bit awkward when you give it a second look, at least it's not a sour remark. It sparks best when it simply explores around the context, which seems to be the only thing the film is interested in. It also works better when the ""Foodnimals"" were introduced, mostly because the characters are giving them names out of puns and that's pretty much of the film's humor. Puns may be annoying for some people, but it adds flavor to the gags.Even a half-baked plot can't keep this from being entertaining, the world itself is already a pure delight. Many of the cast from the first movie returns; Bill Hader, Anna Farris, James Caan, and the rest still got it by bringing plenty of charm and sweetness in their characters. While the new ones; Terry Crews replaces Mr. T as Earl, but it seems perfect enough for him to fill these shoes. And Will Forte also gives a fun performance as Chester V. The visuals brings it to the table, it has become even more eye candy than before which makes a good recommendation to be seen in theaters. It's all deliciously adventurous and utterly whimsical that made things a lot lively.Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2 is a piece of cake blockbuster that is easy enough for anyone to swallow. I believe this is good for people who need a little light entertainment in a while; as long as you're able to not chicken out from the film's numerous amount of cheesy puns. But in the end, you may get use to it, sometimes contagious, which made me pretentiously use some in this review. It's still undercooked regards to the plot, but the amazing technical work and great voice acting covered that up. It's no means to be perfect, we just sometimes need a simple funny and purely imaginative film to spend in our time, and this is one of the good choices."
5,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,16 January 2014,I liked it,"I love animations and visual effects so I love these films. The story isn't excellent but I don't care so much is these kind of films. Pixar is absolutely better in this, of course, but I love all these films, so I liked a lot also this one. The most thing I like in Pixar's films is that they aren't for children. In fact there're a lot of quotes that a child can't understand. Furthermore, the animations are really great, fantastic, gorgeous, something that a child can't realise and like totally. Although, there're a lot of funny moments but it's not enough for a better vote, so it's a 7, thanks to the animations. They are really well done, and also the ideas of the food-animals, or foodimals like the film said, but the story is just a 6. The first one was better, but I suggest to you to watch both of them, if you like animation films."
6,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,,28 September 2013,Great fun!,"Kind of what I expected but even better.My kids saw and loved the first one (many times over). Then when my son saw a trailer for #2 he literally begged to see it today the 2nd day after opening.The plot is a bit clich√© but then not like it detracted from anything. The sights and sounds, the funny little cute things, etc., is what it is all about.A point in about 20min in my younger son turned to me and said ""I like this part!"", and he really laughed a lot. I felt it's aimed mainly for kids, but then probably pretty enjoyable for adults too. Like they sprinkle in some humor in places that only teenagers and adults would get.A fun film for the family, highly recommended."
7,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,2,14 January 2014,Undercooked.,"When I watched this sequel, I thought... no, I hoped - that NOTHING can really be worse than the original. But there is a good line from one writer: ""If you go down... you gotta go all the way"". Seems like the ""Lot of people"" who made this film shared the idea.I don't know where to start... Perhaps with the basis - child cartoon. Unlike the original, this can actually be viewed by a child. Perhaps some toddler around 5 years old. There is plenty of smiling berries, marshmallows and the likes that serve a better cuteness dish than Fight the Power cats of the original. And there is actually morale. Again, I thought Avatar was the worst example of twisted logic. No. Let's promote fishing and save all the cute living food, just so that kids could grow up and find out... That food isn't magically pooped out of a Santa's rear. It's cooked from living animals, from killed and served plants... it's fished with hooks that kill you painfully. But no - that's a cartoon. Living is good, cooking(yeah, that was the main enemy) - is bad. Either way - again, for a child that wants cute and cuddly, kind and caring - that is a fitting cartoon. Perhaps he will be drawing with a brown crayon after watching it, but that's a side-effect. That's why it's 2, not 1 out of 10.As for the rest of you people, who haplessly paid for it... Well, you can always get stoned hard. There are many movies that are supposed to be watched that way, and I bet this LSD-addict scripwriter's creation should do the trick.If I had to put it in more organized manner, it would probably be like this: 1. Crazier than original. Overkill. 2. Twisted morale. About half of the story could be wrapped inside-out, it would still be a good cartoon... except it would make sense. 3. More predictability than the original. You know how it's going to end the first time you see Chester. Oh, well, kids are dumb, right? No need to stay true to the rules of cinema, to give the watcher at least the hope of something unusual.Conclusion: Everyone wants to be unique. Even cartoons. And, as usually, when you just can't imagine a good way to be unique... You do something crazy. Like flinging your poo. Sure, you will stand out. You might even get top-views on YouTube! But unfortunately, for any logical person out there... You would still be just flinging the poo.And that's how I see this franchise. It is unique, granted. But it's not worth ""being"" unique."
8,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,30 December 2013,Why are people so negative!!,"Ill start by saying I am 26 and I went with my 25 year old partner to watch this film, I have to review this film solely for the reason that people have been overly harsh with there assessments of this movie.No animation film bar classic Disney really goes into any great story lines or tries to really pull at your heart strings or tries to go all in to win an Oscar, so for the people giving this a low rating I am genuinely baffled as to why.These films in recent times try and do the following in my eyes: 1)Show a great imagination to capture an audience. 2)Create characters within the film that will sell merchandise as well as be loved by the people watching. 3)Entertain and show plot twists to keep the viewers engrossed throughout. 4)Be accessible for as many age groups as they can.This film does all of that and more and is completely enjoyable. It is smart, funny and totally awesome for kids and adults alike.Films like this aren't ever going to be up there with all time greats! but its films like this that warm your heart and make you smile!.It is a great film for family, kids or even a date night.Great film and look forward to number 3.Enjoy and guarantee you will leave satisfied!!!!"
9,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,,26 September 2013,There's an undeniable pleasantness surrounding everything in the film.,"Pixar might have a monopoly on the emotional depth and resonance that  refuse to elude its high-class productions, but Sony Pictures Animation  certainly knows how to make an entertaining animated feature. Instead  of the weighty pathos that frequents the aforementioned company's  projects, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" utilizes a nonstop,  universally appealing sense of humor and endlessly imaginative visuals.  Children and adults alike will revel in the comic wonderment of  ""foodimal"" hybrids that fuse popular fruits and vegetables with  energetic critters.  After saving his island hometown of Swallow Falls from his  victual-generating invention gone awry, lab-coated Flint Lockwood (Bill  Hader) settles down with his friends to clean up the leftovers and  build a new laboratory with romantic interest and meteorologist Sam  Sparks (Anna Faris). He's assisted by his bushy-eyebrowed father Tim  (James Caan), chicken-suited mascot Brent (Andy Samberg), police  officer Earl (Terry Crews) and his son Cal (Khamani Griffin), Sam's  cameraman Manny (Benjamin Bratt), and his pet monkey Steve (Neil  Patrick Harris). Just as they begin the reconstruction, legendary  inventor Chester V (Will Forte) lands in his helicopter to recruit  Flint to his massive LiveCorp research facility in San Franjose,  California, where he secretly plots to use the youngster and his  invention for nefarious purposes (none-too-subtly dubbed ""Operation  Capture the Invention"").  There's an undeniable pleasantness surrounding everything in the film ¬ñ  even in regards to the villains. ""Saturday Night Live"" veteran Will  Forte takes the reigns as a double-crossing, hip, evil-scientist  megalomaniac guru, wielding an army of doppelganger holograms and  sentinels in formidable armored robotic suits. His sidekick is an ape  with communication skills named Barb, voiced by the instantly  recognizable Kristen Schaal (known recently for providing voices on  ""Gravity Falls,"" ""Adventure Time,"" ""Bob's Burgers,"" ""Archer,"" and  ""Despicable Me 2""). Just as the evildoers exude a goofy hilarity, even  while executing criminal schemes, the rest of the film revels in  infinitesimal details that amplify the joviality. Occasionally, the  deeper notions of bullying, choosing role models, studying the living  food instead of destroying it, and valuing friendships enter the  picture, but they are quickly brushed under the carpet for more  appealing animated absurdities and endangerment.  Shrimpanzees, watermelophants, peanut butter and jellyfish, tacodiles,  and bananostriches are but a few of the delightfully creative creature  designs that run amok in Swallow Falls. Everything is just so  ridiculously cute. The dialogue is also spectacular, using rapid-fire  conversations and nonstop jokes to aid in visual merriments that  include ravingly flamboyant gesticulations and a fabulous food fight  finale. The character designs, unbridled movements, extreme facial  expressions, and food monster adventures are consistently amusing,  recreating a Jurassic Park of sorts, overrun by colossal, primordial,  edible behemoths and wide-eyed, cuddly, dainty produce with faces. )"
10,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,2 September 2014,Delicious.,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, answering all of those questions from the end of #1, is silly fun. Which is a good thing, seeing as how it's a cartoon aimed at little kids. And me, naturally. This was right up my alley.It's a simple story. That wonderful machine created by Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) that bestowed food falling from the sky for the island town of Swallow Falls has been deactivated, thanks to a plethora of food and a desire for people not to be harmed by chunks of sustenance dropping on them. Now the island must be cleaned up, and the corporation Live Corp., run by Flint's idol Chester V (Will Forte) gets the contract. The town's citizens are relocated temporarily while Flint realizes his lifelong dream and becomes an employee at Live Corp. The problem? It seems that the food created by the machine has become...sentient. And it's fighting back! Flint and his friends - Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), cameraman Manny (Benjamin Bratt), policeman Earl (Terry Crews, stepping in for Mr. T), Chicken Brent (Andy Samberg), Steve the Monkey, and Flint's dad Tim (James Caan) - head back to the island. The mission: locate the machine and shut it down. But it seems that Chester and his orangutan assistant Barb (Kristen Schaal) have other plans, plans too devious to mention in detail here, lest your eyes be singed.Anyway, here's the cool thing. The sentient foodstuffs are basically tangible portmanteaus of food and animal, like the wild tacodile, the watermelephant, the pie-thon, the cheespider, and the bananostrich. Luckily, most of these creatures were benign to begin with. I mean, there aren't any lions or tigers or bears or scorpions. Now, setting aside the question of what these Foodimals would eat, since they themselves are made up of food, these are creative inventions. Almost makes you want to buy one or two as stuffed animals.Meanwhile, back at the boat, Tim bonds with sentient pickles over fishing. I swear, I am so glad this movie was rooted in reality. I mean, sure, pickles probably couldn't cast that well, but still - kudos are deserved here.This is about Flint's needing to choose between his idol and his friends and family, between doing what he knows will help his inventing career and what he knows is right. It's about being reminded about those closest to you, lest you disdain their influence. It's also about being able to change one's mind in light of new evidence, and it's about not killing anything that has eyes and/or talks. It's also about 95 minutes.Hader is terrific, as is the supporting cast, even when they're not given much to do but run and hide. Or cackle evilly. I was more impressed with the vocalizations of the Foodimals, such as Barry the strawberry or the pickles, voiced by codirector Cody Cameron. Kind of thought Frank Welker had stumbled on set.No meatballs, ironically enough."
11,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,9,3 October 2013,"I love the first one and love this one, too!","I'll admit that I'm a HUGE fan of the first film (I made a Flint Lockwood costume for Halloween and Comic-Con) and was pretty excited for this one...good thing it lived up to the hype I brought into it! The movie is just plain fun, no two ways around it. The story is awesome, the creature designs for the foodimals were just amazingly creative, the voice acting is top shelf stuff and the humor is fantastic. While I admit I didn't laugh as much or as hard as I did the first one (seriously, I thought I was going to pass out in the first one), I still laughed a lot and had a great time in the theater watching it.My favorite part of the film, and this may sound strange, was the way the animators crafted the backgrounds when the story heads to the now food dominated Swallow Falls. Seeing the landscapes be turned into food (like a swamp made of syrup or mountains made of rock candy) were incredibly amusing and just shined with creativity.This one is going on my ""Repeat Viewing"" list, I enjoyed it that much!"
12,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,10,5 December 2015,Cloudy 2 is absolutely hilarious! A great movie!,"I know I'm too late to review this film, but I decided to do it anyway. Cloudy 2 didn't really interest me all that much from the previews, and I initially wanted to decline this before I saw it(I was actually more interested in Despicable Me 2, which was too cheesy in my opinion). But then, the weekend it came out, I was dealing with school and things like that until my mom asked: ""Wanna go watch Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2?"". I said yes because I haven't seen my mom much because she was always working, so I decided to spend time with her. It turns out that Cloudy 2 was actually really good! The visual effects are dazzling(water, sparks, fire, other textures) and the 3 of us were laughing out loud a lot(my brother and my mom), along with the rest of the audience erupting with laughter throughout the show. The characters are love-able and hilarious, the humor is sharp and witty, the animation is detailed and crisp and the food animals are adorable. What's not to love? Also, one thing to note is that I saw it in 3D, and it actually really makes the special FX work and it did make me flinch at times. So make sure you see it in the added dimension for more depth. Note that I saw it first release."
13,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,10,6 July 2014,Even better than the first movie!,"For this movie, the team really did put efforts into the humor.The animation graphics are just as great and even the ending credits contains several laughing points. There were several new characters in this movie and all of them have demonstrated totally different personalities.Of course, a good movie always contains great plotted central mysterious problems, however, this one was quite easy to find out who is evil or good at the starting point, but I think the plot was easy enough for small kids to understand.But let me tell you, if you think the plot isn't good, the laughter was the hero to safe this movie.I think it will do great for a family movie for grown-ups and kids. I was thrilled to watch the entire movie. The sound effects was great too."
14,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,10,24 February 2014,"Wow, Awesome Movie For The Whole Family!!!","The movie has so much excitement. The characters are back from the first plus new ones. So many great effects like the first one except even way better!!! If you like the first one you will love this one, in my opinion it was way way better then the first it went by so fast it seemed like one big thrill ride for the eyes ears and the great emotions that we as humans have. I could go on and on about this movie but to sum it up in one word, Fantasticallysupericious :) There were many parts of the movie that made me laugh. It was so good that it seemed like a lightning flash went by. I recommend this movie for anyone wanting to have a great thrill ride. People loving animation, cgi, and food especially!!! This movie is a keeper!!! I can't say enough good things about it. :)"
15,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,18 October 2013,Too Cloudy This TIme,"The review: I wanted to like this movie. My oldest loved the first ""Cloudy"" movie, and I concurred. It had a very unique plot, some funny characters, decent supporting characters, and although lacking a main protagonist, everything worked well. Things don't work too well here.'The film picks off immediately where the last one leaves off. After saving his home island, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) wants to start a lab with all of his friends but is quickly swayed by a childhood hero of his who is a scientist with some uterior motives. This character (not just the voice or the appearance, but whole ""protagonist"" idea seems way out of character for this movie, at least when compared to the first one. In this movie, instead of out of control food, the danger is apparently ""foodamals"" which are mutated pieces of food that are also living. This just never really clicks for me. About halfway through the ""foodamals"" do start to get a little amusing and the rest of the movie is ""alright"" but fails compared to the first one. The protagonist here seems so out of place and annoying, it was really difficult for me to get over."
16,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,5,27 September 2013,Okay,"This movie is worth watching if you have kids and they really loved the first one. Over all it is just like the first with a lot of similar gags and leans on the same characters doing the same types of jokes as in the first movie, but just not as well. It's like a pale imitation of the first one without any of the magic that made Cloudy With A Chance Of Meat Balls awesome for the whole family, parents and kids alike or even adults watching it alone just for fun. But even with that it is hard to follow up such a great movie (and I must say I usually don't mind sequels but Cloudy With A Chance Of Meat Balls 2 just sounds stupid to me) and this movie is definitely worth seeing. Maybe not on the big screen but kids will like it, there's enough silliness and fun to keep them watching if not thoroughly entertained for the full eighty minutes or so!"
17,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,5,30 January 2014,These films do a great job of really capturing that kids' book feel!,"'CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 2': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2009 hit animated kids' film 'CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS', which was in turn loosely based on the children's book of the same name (by Judi and Ron Barrett). This movie was scripted by John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein, and Erica Rivinoja and is a new idea (not based on the book's sequel 'Pickles to Pittsburgh'). It was directed by Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn and executive produced by the original film's directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Actors Bill Hader, Anna Faris, Andy Samberg, James Caan, Neil Patrick Harris, Benjamin Bratt and Will Forte all return as voices (with Terry Crews replacing Mr. T. as the voice of Officer Earl). If you enjoyed the original you're bound to like this movie as well.The film picks up right where the last one ended with Flint Lockwood (Hader), Sam Sparks (Faris) and the rest of the people of Swallow Falls being relocated to San Franjose, California, so that a big corporation can clean up the food left behind in the storm (from the original movie). The company is lead by Flint's childhood hero Chester V (Forte), a famous inventor. Flint is later asked by Chester V to return to the island in order to help him locate the FLDSMDFR (Flint's invention which caused the food storm). It's now causing food to come to life in Swallow Falls and Chester V is afraid they'll escape the island and threaten the rest of the world. Flint's friends help him on his mission as they learn Chester V may have ulterior motives.I love the imaginative world created by these movies and think they do a great job of really capturing that kids' book (and cartoon) feel. This one is also a nice homage to the 'JURASSIC PARK' flicks (especially the classic original). I like all of the cast as well, although their talents are somewhat wasted in these films. The characters are likable but the movies aren't really that funny (there are a few good laughs, here and there, in both films though). I'd rate this one about the same as the first; I'm sure they're both a lot of fun for kids (and mildly amusing for adults) but nothing too memorable or special.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NdCvPRYk4"
18,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,,26 December 2013,So much fun to watch,"This film is about a young inventor who has to stop the machine that churns out monster food that is alive.Just like the previous film, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" is a cute and fun film. I really like all the cute food, especially the cute strawberry. There is so much creative process in making the characters, such as the hamburger with fries leg, or the tacos dinosaur are simply quite brilliant. Watching all the food coming alive is so much fun, and it certainly brings out the kid in everyone.""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" is a great escape from the mundane world, where strawberries don't have big eyes. It's so much fun to watch!"
19,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,27 September 2013,Holy Guacomole! This is a Fun Time!,"I went into the film with high expectations and they were partially fulfilled. Compared to the first movie, this film goes for a lot more attempts at getting a laugh and surprisingly misses a little more times too. An audience can only take so many food puns before it becomes generic, but the kids will obviously never get tired of it, trust me. This movie is by far the quirkiest animated film I've ever seen with so many new and involving characters who each have their own hilarious persona. At times throughout this fun high calorie adventure, it seems as though it was rushed in it's story which is really evident in its ending which does feel hurried. All the humor really relies on are food puns and the mannerisms of the characters which are enjoyable but your left wanting that one big laugh. The animation however is top notch with such beautiful environments and the fluidity of the characters movements are a real treat. Overall, the is a well intentioned flick for kids that was a little but too light on the comedic side."
20,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,10,18 November 2013,See some of your favorite foods come alive,"This is another film that I really like. It's full of action, comedy and fun to watch. Some of my favorite foods come to life with names like tacodiles, shrimpanzees, cheesespiders and many more. Of course the 3D animation is amazing with great sights, and sounds bringing the magic of this story to life. The foods and vegetables are bigger than life and so exciting to see. One of my favorite scenes is when Berry tries to say Sam and it comes out anything but the name of Sam. Its sounds so funny! I have a lot of favorite foods in this film, but I must admit my ultimate favorite is the fluffy marshmallows. They are a family that is so cute and adorable.In order for Flint and his friends save the world, they need team work, which is one big message in this film. Not only does Flint need the cooperation of his friends to make everything right again but he also learns a valuable lesson in doing so. I like the way the story writers, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, writes a great script with such powerful messages that even young kids can understand, enjoy and put into practice in their everyday lives. Other voice talents in this film include James Caan (Tim Lockwood), and Andy Samberg (Brent McHale). Also Will Forte (Chester V) plays a great villain and really makes it where you do not like him at all and wishes he would just go away!I recommend this film for ages 6 to 18. This is a film that the whole family can enjoy. I give it 5 out of 5 stars because it has a great storyline, a great message and the comedy is really funny. See some of your favorite foods come alive in ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2."""
21,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,2 October 2013,Has entertaining has the first one,"The animation is amusing to say the least, and the story is for kids and adults to enjoy. The actors doing the voices overs seem to match there cartoon counterparts. But Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and it's sequel, is no Toy Story, they are just meant for pure laughs nothing more.It was enjoyable time, no Oscar winner, but I don't think it was trying to be. The animated living food is well put together. And the scenery is amazing to watch. Bill Hader, Anna Faris and James Caan really bring there characters to life. Will there be a third one, who knows. But you can still enjoy the fun adventure, and the fun characters that come with it."
22,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,1,16 March 2014,Wasted Potential,"For the first review i will ever write, i decided to review this awful movie.I was a huge fan of the first one, it was funny, had great voice actors and was really original (not completely original but still very original compared to other animated movies). I was hoping the sequel would be the same, but boy was i wrong. This movie was trash compared to the first one. The plot was so generic that any long time movie watcher like myself could tell exactly what was going to happen. I mean its basically a carbon copy of the most generic movie narrative ever. They also changed a whole bunch of the character voices, including Earl the policeman and Steve the monkey. They then expected us to care about these characters despite them sounding nothing like they did in the first movie. This movie may be somewhat enjoyable for kids and families, or for people who haven't seen the first one but other than that it is god awful. The first movie was fine the way it was and did not need a sequel as bad as this."
23,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,4,9 October 2014,Poster film for sequel-icitis,"""Cloud 2"" walks right into the standard reasons the sequel always comes across about 2/3rds as good as the original. Cody Cameron overloads the film with the elements that made the original, well, original. Every conceivable color is used, the visuals are wild and imaginative and a lot of dopey food puns are tossed around (""there's a leek in the boat""). Unfortunately, throwing in more these elements makes for a more overwhelming and not, necessarily better film. Take the food monsters in the film - while some are mildly entertaining (flamangoes), most are just stupid (a spider/cheeseburger hybrid?). To continue the food metaphor, putting more of the same spice into a dish patrons previously found enjoyable can work against it. The father/son dynamic which gave dramatic drive to the original gets over played here with Tim, the father, now looking for validation from Flint, the son. Credit Terry Crews for bringing and interesting and distinctive void to the proceedings. In short, not a bad film but not quite worth making a special time to see."
24,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,14 October 2015,No spoiler review,"P.S I you have not seen Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs 1, don't read this review. You have been warned.Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs 2. The sequel to the movie that is basically a rip off Jurassic Park II, and not decent one at that. Although I can give the movie credit, the acting was decent, the animation is good, and the screenplay is also decent, but my main complaint is the story. It was ripped straight out of Jurassic Park II. The comparisons are obvious, the story is similar, though altered slightly to fit the pervious film's canon. Although the cast has change a bit, Mr T. A.K.A Earl from the first movie has been replaced. That's really it.Now let's get to the plot, taking place right after the first movie takes place. The Island has been left in ruin after the first movie with food absolutely everywhere. The gang from the first are celebrating for beating the device(I'm not going even try to write it.) Until a new character, Chester V, A.K.A Will Forte, tells them he and his team is going to clean up all the food, while the main characters are relocated to San FranJose,(Funny Pun). We'll his crew, ""Cleans up"". Over all an okay movie, a not original plot, but those food/animal puns were kind of funny."
25,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,5,16 February 2015,Just a typical sequel...,"The first movie was funny, heartfelt, and original. This was, as I like to say, a tired shell of its popular counterpart. I say ""tired"" because the gags are LAZY. Throughout the movie, stupid jokes related to food are made. ""Haha! I cut the cheese! Aren't I a great comedian suckers?""The plot was quite confusing, too: ""so let me get this straight. Flint's food machine had malfunctioned to the point where it creates evil food that acts like animals, but now apparently the animals are friendly, and the annoying stereotypical evil scientist had made that a plan all along in order to create live food so that he could make it into health-food bars? Why did he make the food monsters, as apposed to regular food that he could use? I'm confused, and I'm sorry if I got anything wrong; I had tuned out a bit during this movie due to its lame jokes."""
26,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,6 August 2014,"More Sugar, Less Vitamins","Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs Uno was a surprise success. It took great leaps away from the source material, but managed to be cute, funny, colorful, and heart-warming.Well, at least the sequel is three of these things.Cloudy 2 is filled with tongue-in-cheek puns, and honestly has some of the best 3D animation I've seen. Its true! Its better than the first, with attention to detail. All the food animals are bright, creative, and adorable.The movie is just as fun as the last, perhaps even more...but, like most animated sequels, the plot and character take a nosedive. The first focused on love, inspiration, and family relationship. The second is the typical friendship shtick and has a strangely pro-vegan message. I mean, some of these food animals have human-like intelligence, but a lot are no different from chickens and cattle. :V The characters are worse-off from the original. Brent, Manny, and Earl have no role in this film. Manny and Earl were at least funny, but Brent just spouted his ""UH OH!"" shtick. Flint and Sam are still friends, but it doesn't even seem like they're dating. Chester V is a stereotypical villain, although his physical, noodley actions were amusing.If your looking for humor, cutesy things, or something to entertain the kids, its fine. The story isn't good, but its tolerable enough. If you're looking for the relationships the first one had, you might want to skip this."
27,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,5,30 July 2014,Cloudy with a chance of meatballs? More like cloudy with a chance of sucks-balls...,"I really liked the first movie. It was nice, fresh, had good laughs, lovable characters, interesting plot. This one...This is a schoolbook example of the 'not-needed-sequel-done-badly'. The story was plain, the humor was a total failure - the jokes tried to be funny too hard, so they ended up being stupid most of the time. The animation was brilliant, nevertheless, and it solely made the movie watchable, all of the vibrant colors and shapes keep your eyes busy. I liked how the island looked, some of the inhabitants made an effort (and succeeded) to make a connection with the viewer, but not on a significant level. I give it 5/10."
28,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,1,15 March 2014,Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 1/2,"The 1st Cloudy with a chance of meatballs wasn't really good. But when they made the 2nd one they ruined the movie way worse than it already has. Please don't make a third one. It was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. My top 3 are National Treasure 1 and 2, Labyrinth, and the Chronicles Of Narnia movies. It would have been better if it would of been less stupidity in the movie and a little more of adventure in both the movies. The only thing good about it is that you learn from your mistakes is the theme for the movie. The inventions should just be more than 1 that really like actually works only the monkey thing and the food thing works which isn't a right thing to do in the movie."
29,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,5,6 October 2013,Really disappointed with the sequel,"Let me start by stating that I really, really liked Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs - the first movie. For me it worked on many levels - as pure harmless fun for kids, as a morality tale about consumption, greed and abuse of science, as a good story with believable character development (with almost all characters showing some likable treats) with some funny blockbuster hints and references to top it off. The trailer for the second one left me with an uneasy feeling that it all is going to be reduced to a ""Jurassic Food Park"", so my expectations going to the cinema were moderate. The kids wanted to see it as they liked the first one too, thus we went. Unfortunately, the movie really is just mediocre. The story is a hodgepodge of clich√© ideas with little added value to any of the characters. There is nothing to hold onto, nothing not seen before, no surprises. The design of food animals/landscapes is certainly quite cute and even imaginative at times, but (except for Berry) they serve as a mere colourful backdrop to a weak plot with predictable ""twists"". A plot that gets washed out of memory soon - just like fast food is, as soon as one encounters a meal prepared with love and care, instead of a reheated TV dinner."
30,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,1,12 January 2014,Worse movie ever,"I have no words to describe this piece of garbage! Even my MONKEY killed himself on very first minutes.. I killed myself after writing this review. DO not watch, unless you know is the end of the world and you deserve to suffer a bit more. Totally waste of time, energy... cant believe there are people who said they like... I believe they are evil... they want you to suffer the much they suffered. There is NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING watchable.. When I last checked this junk was showing 6.6 out of 10... for the god's sake whoever gave 2 stars to this?! Director's Mother, father, cousins and so ? C'Mon it would be fair enough if they get themselves a gun and robbing us at cinema's entrance PRIOR we have watched this... at least they would save me from suffer that much. The worse hour and half in my entire life. Sadly I can't give negative stars... this movie for sure deserves a billion NEGATIVE stars"
31,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,9,30 October 2013,Cloudy with A Chance of Awesome,"This movie is in a word, amazing. It may not have as much comedy as the first movie and have the frequent childish joke (""I'm gonna cut the cheese"") but that doesn't ruin the film, because some of them are quite funny (""There's a leek in the boat""). The casting of this film really makes it better. Neil Patrick Harris as Steve the monkey is hilarious And obviously Bill Hader and Anna Faris make a great team. A bit disappointed that Mr.T didn't reprise his role as Earl but meh. The only acting that I thought was weak was Kristen Schaal as Barb the ape. But overall, this movie gets a 9/10 for cool storyline with an interesting twist but the occasional bad actor here and there. But that happens in any film. Definite cinema trip if you like animated comedy."
32,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,27 December 2013,"God, I am not hungry after watching this one...","I was skeptical how this movie will turn out to be after the first part. But, then this was a cute movie too and the living foods were adorable enough. some moments were hilarious.. Especially that strawberry was the cutest of all. Haha, and the concept of living food and ecosystem in itself was novel and entertaining. The other characters from the first part did their parts well.. Steve and Sam were good.. It was hilarious to see his walking TV, rat birds still alive and running and flying.. All in all, you should watch this movie at least once.. Its cute, if you're into animation movies, but better watch the first part so that you appreciate the characters in here.."
33,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,27 December 2013,Wishy - washy!!,"Almost five years after the release of the first movie, Sony pictures animated comes out with the second part. And sadly, it was definitely NOT worth the wait.The film started with no promise and took a pretty dry and boring turn fast. I would'nt say it was unbearable or anything. You can definitely watch it once. But it is not a film you would spend hours or even minutes thinking about, once done. The animation (especially after having just seen Frozen) was pretty tacky. The 3d effect is laughable. Even the oh-so-cute strawberry named ""Berry"" was swaying between cute and bland. The story line, though, was interesting. But there weren't any songs (which for me define a good animated movie). However, I loved some of Sam's lines like - ""How can you eat a living thing?""Did I Have a few laughs? Yes a few. I could count them. Did the film keep me interested throughout? Wanting for more? Wondering what was going to happen next? No. It definitely did not. I sat through the entire film and probably remembered a max of two, maybe if I really stretch my memory three scenes as I came out. Now I don't know about you, but that for me is not worth spending my Christmas morning on. Bottomline - Don't waste your money. Wait for it to come on the tele and catch it then."
34,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,4,14 December 2013,Excessive,"Too many characters, too many characters at once, overwhelming colors.Poor script and too little fun moments.But the worst it's that the story is overwhelming. It goes left, right, backwards, left again, turns around, turns around one more time..My guess is that the director put the script in a blender by mistake then tried to patch everything back again.Don't forget that the characters are already being weird aliments, so adding psychedelic colors and a tornado flying objects action like really depicts a refined chaos.My suggestion, get yourself a good popcorn or something sweet to chew so you can forget what you are seeing and taste what you are eating. And it will be a real taste.Oh, and finally, who is producing such movies towards a young audience ? Are they high at job or what?"
35,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,18 October 2013,Fun sequel,"Oddball inventor Flint Lockwood, having invented a machine which turns water into food (with disastrous results) and finally hooked up with TV newsgirl (and frustrated scientist) Sam Sparks in the original film, finds himself so seduced by his childhood idol, inventor Chester, that he fails to see he is abandoning those he loves in favour of following someone with ulterior motives.The original film was a delight: also one of the most visually inventive movies to come along in a long while. Episode 2 adds in the notion of idolising someone who is corrupt (Up, anyone?), but otherwise sustains the level of knockout eye candy. The story is quite sufficient to hang the visuals on, and the visuals alone are enough to justify seeing the movie.The voice talent is excellent, and there are some good gags. It is lacking only the originality which its predecessor had, the fate of sequels everywhere."
36,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,9 September 2017,"Almost, if not just as good as the first film","This film greatly surprised me. I was expecting a middle of the road sequel, but what I got was a cute, funny, well written, and well animated film that made the first one great. Granted, there are a few minor flaws in this film, but those were no where near enough to change my opinion. This is truly one of those films that surprised me and, to be honest, is another great example of what Sony Animation Studios does best, and this, as well other good films by them just show that they are capable of making some good stuff. Hopefully, they learned their lesson with the god-awful joke of a film ""The Emoji Movie"". Anyways, the jokes in this film are mostly funny and carry the same humor from the first film. The story, while it is somewhat predictable, is well paced, well written, and flowed almost seamlessly from the first film. The animation in this film is done very well and looks very detailed and polished. Overall, I was very impressed with this film and I think it's a really good, if not perfect sequel to the first film. I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the first film and hasn't seen this yet, as it's surprisingly great. However, it is very recommended to watch the first film first, as this film takes place immediately after the first one ends."
37,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,2,29 August 2017,Absolutely terrible,"I didn't like the first film, but there's a huge difference between that and this. The first film was bad. This one is terrible. It is literally one of the worst animated films of the decade. It's not as bad as Norm of the North, but it shares most of the same problems. Why people seem to hate Norm but not Cloudy 2 is beyond me, because they're basically the same movie. They have a similar plot, similar character animation, and similar humor. The characters are mostly non-entities, and the character animation makes me sick. If you get a copy of this movie, best to just throw it away."
38,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,5 March 2017,The food is alive!,"Minutes after the end of the first film the inventor Chester V, who is Flint's childhood hero and CEO of the Live Corporation, arrives on the island of Swallow Falls and announces that the population is being evacuated for the duration of the clean-up operation. He also offers Flint a job at Live. Flint doesn't realise that his food making machine survived and Chester's actions are just so he can get his hands on it. It turns out the machine isn't just making food it is now making living food and the people Chester sent to retrieve the machine have all met a sticky end. Chester comes up with a new plan; he tells Flint about the food creatures and says they are a threat to the mainland and asks Flint to return to Swallow Falls to find and deactivate the machine. He is meant to go alone but ends up going with all his friends. Once there they discover vast numbers of food creatures but his girlfriend Sam isn't sure they are as dangerous as Chester claimed.While I don't think this is quite as good as the original it is still a lot of fun and certainly very creative. The story is a little bit predictable; the fact that Chester has ulterior motives is made clear from the start so there is no real surprise when Flint and his friends discover the truth¬Ö of course I'm judging this as an adult viewer; knowing the truth might make it more enjoyable for younger viewers. The various food creatures are very imaginative and a lot of fun; they are also a bit frightening at times but never for long enough to be really scary. The story is fun and it was great to see the characters from the original film back in a new adventure. As well as a decent story there are quite a few laughs to be had along the way; one or two of the gags are a little bit crude but nothing too bad and these will probably not be spotted by younger viewers anyway. As before the animation looks great and the voice cast does a solid job. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to any fans of the first film or of modern animation in general."
39,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,3 November 2016,Funny movie with the touch of imagination,"Welcome to Flint's another story. Here, you'll be mesmerized by the world of food (seriously, this movie made me hungry and my imagination for food went wild while watching it). I was quite eager to watch the movie and it did not fail my expectation. Well, the story itself was quite predictable ( we obviously know, who the villain is ). The graphic is beautifully pictured and nicely done. The song by the end of the movie, is cheerful and bright, give a nice feeling towards the movie (although, i didn't find the lyric is related to the story).The concept art is also interesting ( here you'll find so many kinds of food-animals, made by the mix of fruit and vegetables. They also gave unique names for each of them. Some of it, intended as a joke.). Oh yeah, some trivial information, the villain looks a little bit like Mahatma Gandhi, or so i thought. Haha. With all the positive side i have mentioned before, there is small flaw in the movie which made me kinda of disappointed. As the story began, i saw several scene that i thought it wasn't suitable for kids to watch. The plot is easy to understood, but i think it has a lot of space for improvement and development of the story ( not really like the ending, i wish there was more than that ). Overall, it's a nice movie to watch with you friends or family so i'll give it 7 as the score."
40,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,9 July 2016,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,"I was pleasantly surprised by the first film, and it was pretty much inevitable there would be a sequel, I hoped it would be just as much fun as the predecessor. Basically Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) and his friends of Swallow Falls have just saved the world from the FLDSMDFR (""Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator""), his invention that turns raindrops into giant food, but went out of control. Chester V (Will Forte), the super-inventor and CEO of Live Corp, is tasked with cleaning up Swallow Falls, all citizens have been relocated to San Franjose, California, and he has invited Flint to work at Live Corp, where many budding inventors are trying to create the next great invention for his approval and a prize. Six months later, unbeknownst to Flint, the FLDSMDFR survived the explosion and landed back on Swallow Falls island, Chester's search parties have been attacked by monstrous cheeseburgers, many food mutated creatures are learning to swim and pose a threat if they do. Chester sends Flint on a classified mission to find and destroy the FLDSMDFR, but Flint cannot help himself and recruits his meteorologist girlfriend Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), her cameraman Manny (Benjamin Bratt), police officer Earl Devereaux (Terry Crews, replacing Mr. T), Steve the monkey (Neil Patrick Harris), who communicates with the device on his head, ""Chicken"" Brent McHale (Andy Samberg), and his father Tim Lockwood (James Caan) who transports them on his fishing boat. Arriving in Swallow Falls, the island has become an overgrown jungle, Tim stays behind while the rest investigate, finding a variety of living food creatures, Tim encounters humanoid pickles who bond and fish with him. Creatures include Fruit Cockatiel (veveral fruits), Hippotatomus (hippo tomatoes), Shrimpanzee (shrimp chimpanzees), Cheespider (cheeseburger spiders), Mosquitoast (mosquito toast), Bananostrich (banana ostrich), Flamango (flamingo mangoes), Watermelophant (elephant watermelons), Subwhales (whale sub sandwiches), Lemmongs (lemon lemmings), Susheep (sushi sheep), Tacodile Supreme (crocodile tacos) and many more. Chester finds out Flint is on the mission with his friends, he arrives with his assistant Barb (Kristen Schaal), a talking orangutan with human intelligence, he is determined to separate them, Flint begins to suspect that he is up to something. Inventing a device in his former lab to find the FLDSMDFR, Flint is intent on making Chester proud, despite Sam trying to convince him to spare the foodimals, she leaves in anger, along with the others, in the jungle she proves that the creatures mean no harm, but Chester and Live Corp employees ambush them. Flint finds the FLDSMDFR, but is hesitant to destroy it seeing a family of cute marshmallows, Chester seizes control of the machine and announces his plan to use the foodimals for outdated line of food bars, Flint is crushed, and pushed over, but the marshmallows rescue him. Flint, his father and other foodimals plan to infiltrate the Live Corp building under construction on the island, Flint rescues the trapped foodimals and confronts Chester who threatens to turn his friends into food bars, the real Chester is eventually exposed among his many holograms, and Barb has had a change of heart and helps Flint and his friends. Chester tries to get away with the FLDSMDFR, but is eaten by a Cheespider, the island is now safe from Chester and the destroyed Live Corp, the FLDSMDFR is returned to its place, the foodimals continue to live in peace as more are born, and Flint enjoys his first spot of fishing with his father. Also starring Cody Cameron as Barry / Dill Pickle. The voices are fine, Hader still being the incompetent but likable geek, Faris being silly, and Forte being mean, the special effects to create tasty looking living food animals are fantastic, there are many easy to laugh at daft puns (""There's a leek in my boat!"") and plenty of slapstick, it isn't quite as delightful as the original, but adults and children alike will have fun, a colourful animated comedy fantasy. Good!"
41,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,17 April 2016,Imaginative and vibrant.,Cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2 is even more exciting than the first. The gangs all back together again and are up against a slew of mutant food creatures created by Flint's infamous food generating machine.The movie picks up immediately after the first and as you can imagine Swallow Falls is no longer inhabitable due to all the leftovers. After leaving their home for a few months to take on new lives they return to what has become an overgrown food jungle. Expectedly adventure ensues. The whole thing was filled with corny food jokes and wildly creative edible creatures. They really let their imaginations run wild when they thought this stuff up. I was so impressed with the final presentation and really thought it took the series to the next level. A really entertaining great movie.
42,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,26 November 2015,Creative Sequel.,"Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 (2013): Dir: Cody Cameron, Kris Pearn / Voices: Bill Hader, Anna Faris, James Caan, Will Forte, Andy Samberg: Creative animation sequel that opens with a review of the events of the first film where Flint Lockwood's food machine run amuck creating weird weather involving food. This time out he enters a contest of inventions in order to work with his idol Chester V. Central plot regards his home island and the food / animals spurned from his food machine. This is where the film gets creative and hilarious with Cheespiders, Watermelophant, Meatbalrus, Fruit Cockatiel, Tacodile supreme, Shrimpanzee, kiwi birds, Mosquitoast, Cantelope, Susheep, Hippotatomus, Buffaloaf, Flamangos, and ""a leek in the boat."" Directors Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn do a great job at spoofing Jurassic Park in accompanying the whole spoofing of wild life throughout. Bill Hader voices Flint whose good will falls victim to bad influence. Anna Faris voices weather intern Sam Sparks who is Flint's girlfriend and is worried that he is becoming too occupied with impressing the wrong factors. James Caan voices Flint's widowed fisherman father who adapts well to the island when left at the boat. Will Forte voices Chester V who deceives Flint with alternative plans that threaten the food animals. Andy Samberg voices a former celebrity mascot named Brent McHale. This is quite fun for the whole family with terrific animation for the kids while adults will enjoy the clever puns littered throughout. In the end it makes for a great take-out movie going experience. Score: 8 / 10"
43,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,9,15 October 2015,Great Movie for Family Night!,"""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" Movie Review""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" is the sequel to the movie ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs."" This is a about a boy named Flint Lockwood. Ever since he was a little boy, his idol has been Chester V., a genius inventor who has a company called Live Corp. Flint Lockwood's dream was to become a Thinkwanot and work with Chester V. In the first movie, Flint's invention was the ""FLDSMDFR"" which creates food. The machine goes rabid and starts to make giant food. Chester V. then comes to Swallow Falls Island to help with the clean-up of the food. He relocates all the people of the island to San Franjose. While there, Chester V. gives him an opportunity to work for his company. His assistant, Barb, a talking and lipstick wearing orangutan ape, tells Flint that he has six months to prepare for the promotion ceremony. The promotion ceremony is when Chester V. hand picks one inventor to become a Thinkwanot. At the ceremony, Flint does not get picked by Chester. However, the next day Chester V. requests for Flint to come and talk to him. Chester explains to him that the island is being overrun by food animals and needs his help to find the FLDSMDFR to shut it down. Flint happily agrees to go. He then rushes home to inform his dad, Sam, Brent, Officer Earl Devereaux, and Manny. They then all head to the island to try and find his invention. They face many trials and meet new people. In my opinion, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" is an entertaining fiction story. It is very whimsical and engaging. I would recommend this movie for families with young children. However, even if you do not have young children, this movie is sure to put a smile on your face. The story line is unique and creative. Animation was effectively used to help viewer's imagine a world gone crazy with food animals. The movie's plot takes many twists, leaving the audience in suspense of what will happen next. Grab some popcorn and soda and enjoy ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" this weekend. Just make sure the popcorn does not become giant and bury you in your seat!"
44,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,14 October 2015,Very good family movie,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2The movie Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 was a great movie in my opinion. I would rate this movie out of ten probably an eight out of ten only because of some slight drawbacks such as retelling who Flint Lockwood is, even when we already know who he is, but I guess it's only if you sen the movie. I like the fact how they retold the story of Flints turned to catastrophic invention and the damage it did on Swallow Falls. The story of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is that Flint Lockwoods childhood hero Chester V. Who offers to clean up the leftovers from swallow falls and relocates everyone the San Fran Jose California and offers Flint a Job at Live core. When Flint starts his new job he's so excited about becoming a true inventor and working full time with Chester V. but he realizes that he has to create something amazing and be chosen at the vesting ceremony. At the day of the vesting ceremony he is very confident that he will win but is let down and makes a fool out of himself when his party in a box goes off and covers many people. He finally is called in by Chester and is told that he needs flint to go to the island with him to assess the situation and destroy the invention he made, so the world will be safe. All in all I believe that this movie is worthy of its rating and is a perfect movie for ages 6 and up. It is also a great family movie to watch together. By Blake Biscotti"
45,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,4 September 2015,It's gorgeous,"The story isn't great, about a 6/10, but I'm giving it an 8 purely because of how beautiful the art is in this film. I'm a concept artist so backgrounds and cinematography tend to be things I notice a lot more in movies. The cinematography and set design are incredible in this film. I was blown away by how gorgeous it is. It's not just good for a kids movie, it's just good art. The color schemes and shifts from scene to scene are top notch. Some of the best I've seen of any kids cartoon movie and comparable to: Princess and The Frog, Cinderella, Nausicaa, Akira, Lupin III, Kiki's Delivery Sevice, the first Toy Story, etc. I had to keep pausing the movie just to take screenshots. Anyway, that's why I'm rating it so high."
46,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,3,18 July 2015,"Pointless, forgettable, and a waste of time.","After the first one, there was no sequels needed. But those die hard fans enforced a sequel, making this a franchise.Lets just start of with fact that the writing is just awful. It feel like it was only made for fans, with not much heart and charm. The jokes aren't funny anymore, now they're just stale, annoying, and repetitive. Did I mention how pointless the plot is?SPOILERS AHEAD!!OK, in this film, Flint is sent back to Swallow falls because his hero Chester V wants him to shut off his invention that survived the explosion from the first one using a chip. When Flint puts in the chip, it reveals Chester was using his thing to make food animals (Which were created by the machine) into a food bar. Why couldn't Chester use his technology to put the food animals down without telling Flint? This film also has an environmental message to save animals. Environmental messages only films aren't very deep and I prefer messages about having a better life.END OF SPOILERS!!The animation, like the first one has generic back-rounds, but the character design is very mediocre and the humans just don't look beautiful or good. DreamWorks and Pixar do their animation well with humans but not this film.For the characters, on the middle of this pointless adventure, Flint brings his friends even though Chester told him not to. These characters are completely useless, stupid, and unfunny during the adventure. The character that brings the (SPOILER) environmental message to life is Sam. Flint was completely stupid to bring his friends on this trip and there's not much character development.This film is pretty bad. So this film is about Flint getting a job at Live corp. to work for his idol. He has to go back to his home island to save it from food-animals. This film has awful writing , useless characters, and mediocre animation. This film relates to Jurassic park 3 because of the plot. Story: 3/10 Animation: 4/10 Characters: 3/103/10"
47,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,12 June 2015,"""Pun with a chance of more Pun""","The Amount of Puns in this is incredible... It's so clever how it's done (just like the first one) which is what makes it sooo engaging ! It's got the usual predictable plot, no real surprises. But that doesn't matter ! It's great. From the concept to the characters it's so diverse, everything is so vivid, colorful and unique. It just makes it so easy to watch, I just love this film as much as I'm allowed to like a U rated animation. And yes, they do include the 'only older audience will understand' jokes, which certainly makes it more interesting to understand. All in all it DEFINITELY did not let down the first film at all and actually successfully introduced a couple new characters to the main crew ! Can't wait for a third install meant, it better not be a let down !"
48,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,28 May 2015,Surprisingly more delightful than the first,"Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was a pleasant surprise back in 2009, with directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord - before they hit the big-time with 21 Jump Street (2012), it's sequel 22 Jump Street (2014) and The Lego Movie (2014) - taking a rather ridiculous premise based on a slim children's story and making it both hilarious and supremely inventive. It was a story that was wrapped up nicely as not to require a sequel, but with box-office success comes the inevitable follow- up. Miller and Lord lampooned the whole idea of sequels with 22 Jump Street, but decided against helming the next chapter in Flint Lockwood's eccentric world, which makes it all the more surprising that Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 is even more delightful than the first.With the town of Swallow Falls engulfed by giant food as a result of the events from the first film, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), his girlfriend Sam (Anna Faris), his father Tim (James Caan), and the rest of his fellow townsfolk are relocated to California by inventor and TV personality Chester V (Will Forte) while the place is cleaned up. Flint, Chester's biggest fan, is invited to work at Live Corp., where he will be allowed to work on his crazy inventions undisturbed in the hope of landing a permanent job. His 'celebrationator' creation falls flat, but Flint is still summoned by Chester to be informed that the search-parties back in Swallow Falls have gone missing, and the place is now overrun by giant cheeseburger spiders.The cheespiders are just one of many delightful and bonkers 'foodimals' in the film, others of which include shrimpanzees, tacodiles and watermelophants. They're the type of physics-dodging nonsense a child would come up with while bashing plastic figures together, so no doubt children will love them. Adults too, will no doubt get a certain kick out of temporarily switching off the logical side of the brain and turning up the nostalgic side. It's also beautiful to look at, in a hyperactive, blink-or-you'll-miss-it sort of way, with the sheer volume of these bizarre creatures darting in and out of the picture providing a feast for the eyes, and the cheespiders proving to be somehow terrifying and cute at the same time.Above all, it's laugh-out-loud funny and relentlessly chaotic, and there's probably a 'message' in there somewhere as well. Not that the film is too concerned with preaching morals and not that the audience will call for it; it's too busy being exhaustively entertaining for all that. The returning acting talent (although Terry Crews replaces Mr. T as super-ripped cop Earl Devereaux) is uniformly excellent, and newcomer Forte, along with some loopy character design, helps turn Chester V into a charismatic and ever- bending (literally) super- creep. Like a packet of sweets, it can be like a sugar overdose at times, but you'll most likely keep on eating and feel buzzed for a short time afterwards."
49,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,9,11 December 2014,Are You Hungry For More?,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is the follow-up to the 2009 hit film, which happened to be one of my favorite all-time animation films. Now this film is neither fresh nor inventive like the first film, but it still is engaging, it has striking visuals, strong voice-acting, and some clever Jurassic Park references. The screenplay is very strong, though originality is not the strongest suit of the film. I absolutely adored the ""foodnimals,"" and I cannot stop gushing over Barry the strawberry.Cody Cameron's film returns us to our heroes and Swallow Falls. Flint Lockwood is working for his idol, Chester and has plans to be recognized as an inventor. But when he is assigned to travel back to his hometown to find his machine, he takes his friends and they learn that their food is actually....living, breathing beings. While there, Flint realizes that Chester may not be the man that Flint has come to idolize.The film features a boatload of voice talent. After four years, the chemistry between Bill Hader and Anna Faris still very much exist. Those voices are greatly complemented by the wonderful James Caan. Terry Crews replaces Mr. T from the first film, but he does perhaps even a better job because there is hardly any recognizable difference between their voices.Overall, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a very fun film for children and adults alike. It will not win any points for originality, but then again what does these days? I loved the Jurassic Park references and I even think I saw a subtle King Kong reference. The film is at its best when the animals are on screen. Making animals out of food is a really creative idea, and it was a fun idea. This is a very strong sequel to one of my favorite all-time films. I rate this film 9/10."
50,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,6 August 2014,Ignore the poor reviews! This is a great film!,"I HIGHLY recommend you to see this film no matter what age you are! It has humour and jokes in it by the bucket load that are aimed at children, aimed at adults and aimed at both such as Flint screaming and pointing when in the boat ""Aaaaaggggghhhhh there's a leek"" and yes there is a leek in the boat but of the food kind! The storyline at the main page, the page where the list of credits is, is not correct. The way it has been typed makes it sound like Flint's machine has created a whole load of horrific, vile beasts but in actual fact the foodimals it has created are extremely friendly! here is also no mention in the storyline of the eco-system the machine has created, the eco-system in which the foodimals live perfectly happily with each other! The way it has been typed also makes it sound/seem like the world has to be saved from these foodimals, it doesn't! Their eco-system has to be saved from the company Flint goes to work for and it's boss, a man Flint has looked up to his whole life and idolised! The art work is superb, wonderfully bright and cheerful especially in the eco-system where the creators and artists really went to town! How they thought of the animals is beyond me but oh so very clever! Please bring on Cloudy With A Taste Of Meatballs 3! I am really looking forward to seeing it!"
51,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,12 July 2014,Geeky Randy's summary,"After a brief recap of its 2009 predecessor, this fun little sequel picks up right where the first film left off. Citizens of Swallow Falls have been relocated while the island is being cleaned, with Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) being given a position at his hero Chester V's (Will Forte) corporation, only to return to Swallow Falls to find the leftover food has come to life! This installment introduces some fun creatures¬Ö or¬Ö ""foodimals""; particularly, Barry and his strawberry companions (and one blueberry companion), who you'll find adorable. May not be as good as the first (what else is new?), but there's no doubt that a third film is more than welcome! Mr. T's voice is replaced by Terry Crews.*** (out of four)"
52,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,12 July 2014,"Unnecessary, but full of ADORABLE little food critters.","I really enjoyed the first Cloudy movie, and was sad that I never got around to seeing this sequel in the cinema. Now I can say that while it doesn't quite live up to the quirky original, it is full of some of the most silly, most adorable food animals!Following on directly from the events of the first film we see inventor Flint Lockwood trying desperately to join a science corporation ran by a childhood idol of his, the same corporation that has stepped in to prevent consequences of Flint's ""water-into-food"" device. Namely, an island inhabited by living food!The trailer had sold this film to me (and the marketing too) by simply showing us all the crazy animals they had designed for the animation! This is easily, easily the films best quality and quite possibly the only reason it exists at all. Watermelophants? Hippopotatoes? Shrimpanzees? And quite possibly the most adorable marshmallows I have ever seen, I want one. Or several.This design work is very straightforward but it is so enjoyable to watch, much like with the first film, and the animation work is rubbery and loony. Our characters move and behave more like squeezy toys than attempting to look ""real"". I think this is a benefit to the film since we have so many animated films attempting to be realistic or slick and stylish; this is just off the rails, like an old Saturday morning cartoon.So style and design are top notch, but where the film flounders a bit is the story it attempts to provide. The first film was simple: a disaster movie with gigantic portions of food. Cloudy 2 attempts to be more like a dinosaur movie, The Lost World style, with some moral implications and betrayal. Unless you are two years old I doubt any of the ""surprises"" will provide such excitement. The villain isn't particularly good or inspiring, the plot just moves along with all the classic clich√© that we come to expect. Another thing I need to add would be, despite the animation on the characters being fun and lively, the backgrounds were seemingly dead, often flat and devoid of eye catching details. I cannot remember if the first film had this too and this is merely a style choice, but asides some of the final scenes, the backgrounds didn't get much love? The humour is great but mostly in an eye rolling ""oh god did they actually go there?"" manner; the puns are set to overdrive in this film, in fact I think half of the first act's script is entirely puns-for-puns' sake!If it weren't for the goofy and wonderful critters, I would rather watch the first film again. But this isn't bad either! If you enjoyed the first film, like I did, you'll enjoy this too. Just watch it for the cute animals."
53,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,4 July 2014,"A simple, predictable, easy to watch film that is fully aware of its simplicity","Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was clever in the fact that it knew right off the bat that it wasn't trying to be serious. From the first second it explains where they live and spray-on shoes, you know the film's mood immediately. The same kind of goes with Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2. The only problem with this film is that... it cares less about itself.Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 has a vivid and colorful animation that surpasses the first film with its intelligent use of colors. There are a lot of ""Dang, those colors blend well together"" and many beautiful shots. One of my favorite characters to watch is Chester V due to the brilliance in his movement. There is not one thing about his movement that is animated normally or traditionally. His legs are noodles when they bend, his wrists and arms bend at strange 90 degree angles, and his facial expressions are great. Quite obviously within the first 3 minutes, he is the villain.The plot is where the movie doesn't necessarily fall apart, but where the caring stops. With the first movie, you weren't quite sure how it was going to play out. Because it wasn't following the book precisely, it was slightly hard to tell what twists might be coming up. However, this movie follows every clich√©'. The ""childhood hero"" turns out to be the bad guy, the main character ditches his friends, main character is fooled to follow the bad guy, the truth about the animals is learned, and many other such things. The problem with this movie is that you can't say it has a lame plot due to being attached to source material. The plot is simply lame. The movie is well aware of that, but if the plot isn't the main focus then what is?Food puns. Yep, that's it. The focus of this movie is all in food puns. Literally, 90% of this movie's humor arrive through food puns. Other than the puns, you can tell the other focus of the movie is to get creative with food animal concepts. However, other than the Tacodile Supreme, most of the food-animal designs were... boring. Most of the designs were just food with eyes slapped onto it which makes out for a lot of boring creations. To make things worse, most of the animals are incredibly obnoxious. Which is the last issue I had with this movie:Pacing. The movie doesn't know how to slow-down or jump into action. Maybe the movie is intentionally doing this, but it is annoying. One of the scenes that is meant to be more quiet and relaxed is obnoxiously busy and annoying due to tons of hand-waving, fast movements, and food noises. This happens throughout the movie multiple times where quiet scenes are loud (which ruin the mood of the character's emotions) while action scenes are... not as action-packed as they should be.One last note: The movie does that lame ""the animals are nice"" thing and we shouldn't eat them... however... they are literally food. Why not eat them? The new animals will pollute a world eco-system and are entirely edible. Eat as many as you can.Overall, the movie is enjoyable for the wonderful coloring, animation, lighting, and a couple of good puns. As far as the plot and pacing go: it is utterly boring. This is a ""yawn"" kind of movie that you will sit through and enjoy bits and pieces, but you won't find anything truly new in."
54,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,7 June 2014,Survives on Puns and cuteness,"This film was ""okay"".. I say this, because I personally expected it to be a terrible film. Mostly for the fact that it seemed like Cloudy With the Chance of Meatballs wasn't a sequelable movie to me. Usually when movie companies create a sequel to a good film, they end up ruining it.Cloudy With the Chance of Meatballs 2 was alright. The story wasn't amazing at all, but I think it would be enough to please a child. There are a TON of puns in this movie. It can get annoying, although some of the puns are clever. This movie also has a lot of ""cute"" moments. I think without this factor, the movie wouldn't grab much attention at all. The cute moments are definitely cute, but all the cute characters do is be cute, that's really it.The movie was good, better than I expected, but not the best at all."
55,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,6 June 2014,Turning against ...,"I know this is a children's movie and it doesn't have to make much sense (especially if you take the premise itself), but there is too much going on here that I couldn't completely ignore. I'm guessing you have watched the first movie (which was much better), because this continues that story and evolves.The first movie did not really go into length when it came to ramifications when discussing or doing the turning rain into food. But this goes even further. Going down a road that kids might not be able to see as a problem, but adults probably will. Having said that and seeing as I still gave it a 6/10, this works as a children's movie, because it does have a wild imagination ..."
56,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,2 May 2014,Excellent Movie.,"I as a part of the audience should say a few words about this movie line. I love all animated movies; Pixar, Disney etc. These movies are to entertain the mind, not invoke deep philosophical contemplation. The fellow reviewers that gave this movie a 0 or 1 are not Authors, they are not reviewers and they only review to be biased. Looking at you gkarlos- gomes. Don't listen to these imbeciles. If you liked the first one you'll love the second. The movie does what it's supposed to do and that is entertain.The movie has it's down times but all together it has suspense, love, action, adventure, comedy all put together. The names and the funny references are not supposed to be broad, they are easy to spot and are there to get a chuckle.All and all, 8/10"
57,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,23 April 2014,As colourful and inventive as the first but not quite as good story and pacing-wise,"After having already enjoyed the original 'Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs' and heard of this sequel through its trailer (which was misleading because it made this film look promising but it was anything but), I wanted to see this one as well to see how it compared to the original. I've just finished watching this on Amazon Prime Instant Video and while its visuals, animation and vibrancy were on par with those elements from the first, I was somewhat disappointed with the pacing and the story.While the animation was as good as that in the first with the usual cartoonish character designs, it was still a bit jerky and jarring in places, particularly on Earl. The visuals are as colourful and imaginative as those in the original, especially the cleverly-named food monsters/animals (Tacodiles, Shrimpanzees and Flamangos to name but a few) that Flint's machine from the first film churned out due to having unknowingly survived. While the Columbia opening logo was similar to that in the first film what with a banana knocking the lady off her spot, I liked the slight change of the banana making some sort of dolphin chirp sound and galloping off with Barry on top. Two elements that were not quite on par with those from the first were the pacing and the story. The pacing up until the main characters arrive is slow and plagued with unnecessary filler, particularly the recycled animation from the first film and the story was harder to understand than that from the original. I also found it a little similar to that in 'Up' due to Chester V's revelation of using Flint towards the end of the film being similar to Charles Muntz becoming an enemy to Carl in 'Up.' Nevertheless the dialogue was as clever and witty as that in the original, especially the food puns (""Cut the cheese,"" ""There's a leek in the boat,"" ""Easy as - "" ""Pie!"" etc) whether they were intentional or used to finish certain characters' sentences and I laughed at just about every one of Brent's ""Uh ohs!"" Further to the characters, Filnt, Sam, Brent, Steve, Tim (Flint's father) and Earl were as worthy as they were in the original and while I was let down by Earl's son having less screen time, Chester V, Barb and Barry the strawberry were welcoming new additions. Although Chester V has similar characteristics to Charles Muntz from 'Up,' Barb is sharp and sassy and Barry is cute (it is funny when he eats the USB and later poops it out along with a pile of jam in fear). Bill Hader, Anna Farris, Will Forte, Neil Patrick Harris, James Caan and Andy Samberg all did as solid a job as in the original voicing Flint, Sam, Chester V, Steve, Tim and Brent respectively although I was disappointed that Terry Crews replaced Mr T as the voice of Earl but Crews did his best to recreate the voice Mr T provided. Other than that, Kristen Schaal (the fourth actress, voice or otherwise, called Kristen I've heard of, the other three being Kristen Stewart who played Bella Swan in the 'Twilight' franchise, which I'm not as big a fan of as animation; Kristen Bell who voiced Anna in 'Frozen;' and Kristen Wiig who voiced Lucy in 'Despicable Me 2') was just as sharp and sassy as Barb. With regard to the soundtrack, it isn't quite the most memorable element of the film but I liked the use of 'Yummy, Yummy, Yummy' that was just as fitting here as 'Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows' was in the original as well as 'La Da Dee' by Cody Simpson, the song being played over the 2D/stop-motion-animated portion of the closing credits and Paul McCartney's 'New.' I also liked the beautiful and powerful incidental music being played during the flythrough or zooming out of the 'foodimals' land. The brief post-credits scene of Barb asking Steve out for a coffee and Steve suggesting dinner instead was a pleasant surprise. Overall, this wasn't quite as entertaining as the original but the vibrant, inventive visuals, the soundtrack, the return of most of the original voice cast, the new characters and the food puns made this film altogether more tolerable. 7.5/10."
58,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,19 April 2014,A Very Kid-friendly Affair!,"I consider Nick-inspired animated movies as merely watchable but I have to admit, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs did make me laugh and I couldn't possibly give its sequel a miss. I was minutes into the movie and I was sporting the usual 'meh' face and then I watched as Earl Devereaux witnessed something wonderful break into (a) tear and yell ""Its enough to make a grown man cry¬Ö But not this man. Get back in there TEAR!"" and he pulled the tear back into his eye, THAT one scene sold me.Welcome back to the hyper active animated Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 and following a short 'Previously' things are set it motion just after the first movie. Flint, having saved Swallow Falls from his own 'invention gone wrong', the FLDSMDFR, gets relocated to San Franjose by super inventor and Flint's idol Chester V who is tasked to clean Swallow Fans. But Chester ain't what he seems and has got some nefarious plans in the works.Every scene in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is littered with hilarious stuff both animated and not. The comedy is written and executed well and the same goes for the visual gags that happens from start till end. The style from the first movie has been consistently maintained and if you liked the first one you are bound to like this one as well. The animation is fast and and it makes me wonder if it Nick behind it all.As for the cast, almost everyone had me in splits. Be it Terry Crews' athletic cop Earl Devereaux or Andy Samberg's Brent McHale. Neil Patrick Harris' Steve the monkey, despite its limited lines, was just uproarious. Bill Hader and Anna Faris reprises their roles as Flint Lockwood and Samantha Sparks and does enough justice to promise you a few chuckles. The Will Forte voiced Chester made me think they took a jig at Steve Jobs.Yes its first and foremost a kids movie and I only judged it so but in the end, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 was zany, juvenile (in a good way of course), and all out odd ball but it makes for a modestly entertaining flick for adults and could be blindly suggested for kids¬Ö its so colorful I could go wee¬Öand that makes it a brilliant watch if u are high too."
59,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,6 April 2014,Visual Cortex Overload ... I kinda like it,"It's 8 minutes after the first movie where Flint Lockwood and the gang saved the world. His scientific idol Chester V offers him a job at his Live Corp. His invention FLDSMDFR turns water into food, and has made their island home filled with 'foodimals'. Chester V offers to clean up the island while the inhabitants relocate. At Live Corp, Flint works tirelessly to be a Thinkquanaut. After a disastrous embarrassing party-in-a-box incident, Chester V enlist Flint to go back to the island. The FLDSMDFR is still operating, and monster foodimals are on the roam. Flint has to go back to shut down his invention before the foodimals learn to swim and destroy the world. However Chester V has some sinister plan unknown to Flint.This movie is even more crazy and wilder than the original. It is visual cortex overload. Every part of the screen has something inventive going on. I kinda like it, but I understand if it overwhelms most people. That kind of over-stimulation can tire the audience out especially on the big screen. It is a children movie with ADD."
60,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,3 April 2014,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs: The Reign of Foodimals,"Who doesn't agree with me when I say this is not as good as the prequel?I think they were not being creative in giving the title. Adding the number 2 in the end, when we don't even see any meatballs in this movie anymore. Okay, the story departs exactly from where Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs left off, but they could have come out with a better title, like ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs: The Reign of Foodimals"".The story is shallow, but the animation is still good, cute, and creative. Voice acting is still good, with a lot of good puns. However, the jokes are not as funny.It's an okay movie in conclusion, Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures still cannot beat Pixar or Disney."
61,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,31 March 2014,An awesome trip into a world of imagination and creativity!,"I cannot believe this film only has 6.5 rating on here! This (as with the first one) are two of my son and my favorite movies! There is so much incredible creativity that went into making these movies. Something completely different than your normal kids films! As well, it is something adults can appreciate and find innuendos, sarcastic jokes etc, and they are clean, so it is really something for the whole family! Both Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 1 & 2, are so well made, that you almost feel like it could really be happening! The characters are well developed, and their personalities mesh so perfectly together. They are smart, sarcastic, funny, and full of emotion. The music flows wonderfully throughout the movie, and the end credits/song, are a must see in themselves. Very cute and funny! :) Both films are very colorful and if you are able to watch and take them for what they are meant to be, which is a creative, fun new adventure for kids to enjoy, then you too, might be able to relax and enjoy them yourself, and find the humor and creativity involved in coming up with such a fascinating storyline! :) Anything goes! :D"
62,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,24 March 2014,Second is still as fun,"""Another film by ..... a lot of people"" - the title sequence is both a tribute to the many people involved and also a precursor to the humor in the movie, mostly involving lots of pun-ny remarks. 'Food fight' certainly gets a new meaning!A big part of the film feels like a homage to the original Jurassic Park movie - when the team first see the creatures (which look a lot like cartoon dinosaurs dressed as food), when they are being chased by them, when the giant taco makes its appearance. Even the music is similar. But it's not cheesily done.The story is also a heartwarming one. While the created food was the problem in the first movie, here they are the heroes. It still has its heartwarming moments when Flint discovers his real enemies and his real friends (and love?). And the music certainly adds a lot more to the fun this time.This is definitely one of the better movies of the year . Recommended for families or to watch with friends and loved ones."
63,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,9,9 March 2014,Fantastic,"The first movie was original, funny, nice visual colors, etc. So a follow up would be a tall task. Well the writers and cast did pulled it off. Cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2 is even better than the first. Perfect follow up. More complex story line, the colors are vibrant and out of this world as well. Oh ya, the sound track is graced with Paul McCartney. He composed and wrote the song, not bad at all. Every food pun imaginable was used as well. This is a completely different vibe from the Pixar and Dream works animation. Hopefully Sony Animation can pump out more high quality movies like this to add to their repertoire. Highly recommended for the whole family"
64,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,5,8 March 2014,One for all the family! 5/10,"Review: In a funny type of way, I actually enjoyed this movie. I thought that the whole food being demons concept was cleverly put together and I really like the black cop who made me laugh throughout the movie. The storyline had a lot of thought behind it, which kept the movie interesting and a joy to watch. The animation looked excellent and the vibrant colours looked great in HD. The only downside about the movie is that it did seem to drag after a while and it does get a bit silly and corny but it is a kids film and I'm sure that they will enjoy it. It's fun for the whole family but it might be a bit hard to follow for the really little ones. Watchable!Round-Up: It's a bit hard to comment on actors performances when your reviewing a animation movie, but I will say that the mixture of characters was well put together. The tiny Strawberry was a great addition to the film and the gherkins cracked me up. I thought that this movie was much better than the first in this franchise but it would have been good to see the policeman in more of the scenes. Basically, if you want to keep the kids quite for an hour and a half, then you should put on this movie and judging by the money that it made, I'm sure that you will be seeing a 3rd one soon.Budget: $78million Worldwide Gross: $120millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there funny animation movies about a town getting taken over by killer food. 5/10"
65,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,23 February 2014,Food animals instead of food storms,"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs remains an overlooked piece of animation from recent years. Maybe because it's not a Pixar movie, maybe because it doesn't have as distinct a style as the likes of Aardman or Laika's stop motion features, maybe it's because it does have a somewhat generic quality to it at first glimpse. That said, it's a blast of a film, a great joy from beginning to end. And apparently it did well enough at the box office to spawn a successor.Its title is a work of deception. There's few meatballs to be found here, while the meteorological aspect has been toned down. What remains is the characters from the first film, as well as the whimsical humour and offbeat visual design that characterized the previous movie. Though the directors of the original film decided to do The LEGO Movie instead, they left the project in the capable hands of people who understood the quirky subject matter.After Swallow Falls got covered in edible stuff during a giant foodstorm he partially caused, young inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) and his friends have relocated to San Franhos√©, where Flint is now working for Live Corp, a big company of science enthusiasts created by his idol Chester V (Will Forte). While that firm is attempting to clean up the island to make it livable for the human population again, strange things happen to the mop-up crew and Chester calls on Flint for aid. Against his mentor's advice, he recruits his friends, including his girlfriend Sam (Anna Faris) and his stern father (James Caan), to help him in his mission. To their astonishment, Swallow Falls has reverted to a wild, primordial jungle, inhabited by all manner of strange animals and plants, some friendly, others dangerous. And it's all made out of food. Exploring this new wilderness he inadvertently created, Flint finds that not all is as it seems and starts questioning his allegiance. Flint soon must choose between the side of science and cold reasoning or to stick to his irrational friends and family instead, as the two sides of himself prove at odds over the future of the island and its wildlife.Cloudy 2 swaps food weather for food animals. That's not a bad thing, as it avoids lazy repetition. No more zany weather patterns like spaghetti tornadoes, now we have 'foodimals' like shrimpanzees and hippotatomuses. It will come as no surprise that a lot of the jokes are provided by such play-on-words, some ingenious, others less clever. Nevertheless, the wonderful look of these beasties clearly shows the fun the animators must have had while designing this film. At the same time, the characters we came to know and love from the previous film are left intact. Sadly, not all of them are given their due, as the emotional core of the movie is personified by Flint's idol on one side and his father and girl on the other. The remaining supporting characters are doing just that, without contributing to the whole much. Though they are still good for a laugh or two, they could have been left out altogether, in favour of developing the new antagonist more closely. No mistake is made from the beginning on that the expert sillywalker Chester is the bad guy, though in the end, the motivations of his diabolical schemes leave something to be desired, considering his supposed intellect. Cloudy 2 can definitely be accused of putting more focus on the look of the film than on the development of its characters.Such slights are easily forgiven, as the film provides an excellent second course in terms of visuals. The fabulous forests of foodstuff, the clinically clean Live Corp headquarters, the quirky cityscapes, it all looks delectable to behold. Whereas the beasts of the jungle are obviously Jurassic Park inspired, their dwelling place takes a note or two from Avatar's pages, adorned with bioluminescence and all manner of bizarre features. This visual feast definitely sets Cloudy 2 apart from its predecessor, which proved more simple and primitive in this regard, giving it a look and feel all its own. As the plot was inspired by JP, so too the eye candy is only loosely based on Cloudy 1, instead of merely carbon copying it.The elaborate visuals notwithstanding, there's a thing or two to be said against the film's morality. Its message is one of ecological respect, speaking out against the rape of nature for the sake of making money. However, as cute as the foodimals may be, they remain aberrations. An ecosystem has formed on this island, but what of the original ecosystem that had to make place for it? Our heroes connect to these creatures, seeing them as more than food, because they have grown to be living, breathing entities. But what of the sardines they happily consume, which were living, breathing entities to begin with? Should they not also fall under the same category? Where do the protagonists draw the line in deciding which creatures to stand up for, and which to see as mere food? Uneasy questions like these are formed when they do not eat animals made of food, but teach them how to fish for normal lifeforms instead.It seems such questions never occurred to the writers, as the story of Cloudy 2 is subject to the execution in terms of jokes and visual flair. The latter works its magic throughout, awing us with one spectacular sight after another and charming us with their inhabitants, both human and food. The former is good for a smile all through the piece: though the number of truly memorable jokes remains somewhat limited compared to the previous installment, most gags prove effective in the short bursts they seem designed for. If the first movie was the main course, Cloudy 2 is a fine dessert, a four-flavoured sorbet, comprised of your favourite taste, two others you like fine, and one you never really cared for."
66,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,7 February 2014,Its different than what title say but okay,"The title itself is not suitable for this sequel. I guess 'Jungle with a Vicious Foodimals' or something like that would have been fair to be called. Unlike the first part I just found this movie more kiddish. The last decade was the beginning of 3D animations, so it captivated large group of audience with awesome movies. But its time now people to understand animations too would have such low movies like this.Whatever you thought might be, but in my view and for my age, it did not please me like other animation features. I don't know about teenagers, but children will enjoy it for sure more than anybody else. I have not denoted the movie had flaws in the technical aspect, but the theme divides the audience as per age difference.The dialogues were what kept me alive. Many of them were very hilarious. One of it was 'It's enough to make a grown man cry. But not this man. Get back in there, tear'. In some portion the character Chester V annoyed me, I think that is what they wanted from a villain character.This movie itself an unnecessary follow-up so I don't want another sequel unless they initiate back the first movie concept of what title is represented. I don't understand what Lockwood and Co gonna eat if all the vegetables and foods get a life who become their friends. Forget it, it goes on and on and on..."
67,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,5,2 October 2013,Is this the next best thing since Despicable Me 2??? Read on to find out!!!,"Cloudy with a chance of garbage part 2 is finally here, the sequel that nobody really wanted. They probably should have put that as the slogan on the poster. Gone is the enchanting story telling that we're used to from Disney and Pixar, the kind of tale which can captivate the hearts of young and old alike. Instead we have a generic animated movie, which will likely appeal more to kiddies, though they probably won't pick up on the mostly unfunny in-jokes intended for the adults.The story continues pretty much immediately off the heels of the first movie. Thanks to his out of control invention, the food storm from the original film has left the hometown of our mostly unlikable hero, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), uninhabitable. Enter mysterious science super company The Live Corp to clear up the mess. It just so happens that Chester V, head of Live Corp, is Flint's childhood hero and role model. Live Corp is clearly intended as some kind of parody of Apple with Chester V posturing around like a sinister Steve Jobs rip-off, something that will like be completely lost on the younger audiences. It isn't long before Chester V needs Lockwood's help to try and get the ravenous food-animals in the town under control. Lockwood goes in with his friends and dad in-tow. Queue some references to Jurassic Park and some food related humour, not to mention squeaky voiced characters which really felt like rip-offs of Despicable Me's Minions. With time, Flint comes to realize that not everything on their mission is as it seems. Will they get out alive, will there be a happy ending, does anyone care?To be fair, this isn't the worst animated movie by a long shot, but I do feel that these studios are getting more and more lazy. They should stop assuming that anything animated will be an immediate success and be reminded that you still need a decent story.Cloudy 2 is just too forgettable. Replay value is a big deal for me. Imagine six months down the line, if I saw this playing on cable TV while channel surfing, would I stop and watch this movie or would I keep surfing? Answer; I would keep surfing. Even in an animated movie I expect to make some kind of connection with the main characters. Flint's dad, voiced by James Caan, is easily the best character in this while the leads are mostly bland and, unfortunately, forgettable. And why has Terry Crews replaced Mr. T???The 3D also left a fair bit to be desired, although the issues with lateral image blurring that I saw may be due to a fault of the theatre rather than the movie itself.If for some reason you're a die-hard fan of the original, then sure, check this out. It's an improvement over the original but that's really not saying much.For everyone else, despite a couple of amusing scenes, avoid.Rating 5 out of 10.FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET"
68,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,18 December 2013,"Bright, enthusiastic and endearingly simple.","Cloudy 1 was pretty bonkers, what with it's weather-food and such stuff. Somehow, this sequel is even loonier, with the tasty products now developed into animals; ""food-imals"" being the official term. Loaded with puns, sight gags and slapstick humour, everything including the kitchen sink is thrown at this follow-up. That only half it sticks is a shame, but due to the sheer quantity of attempted jokes there's still plenty to smile about, if very little to remember once the end credits roll. The second-tier voice cast - including Bill Hader, Anna Faris, James Caan, Andy Samberg and Neil Patrick Harris - are, if nothing else, enthusiastic, ensuring the dialogue is as energetic as the visuals. There's a handful of small messages - don't forget who your friends are, people deserve second chances, etc - however these are wisely kept on the surface and never shoved down your throat. Unabashed fun is at the top of the menu for this well-meaning and endearingly simple holiday movie."
69,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,,23 October 2013,"Cloudy 2 is a cute, family friendly film that won't have adults yawning while their kids are jumping for joy.","Cloudy 2 starts where the first left off. Shallow Falls is a mess due to the food storm that Flint's FLDSMDFR machine caused. The characters are forced to leave their homes and later find out it's been invaded by food animals. Scientist Chester V, CEO of Live Corp and Flint's hero, is tasked to clean up the island. He sends the Flint and his friends back to clean it up and deactivate the FLDSMDFR machine before more food animals get made and the problem gets worst. Cloudy 2 is a cute, family friendly film that won't have adults yawning while their kids are jumping for joy. It has some great laughs and the animation is very colourful for the children. To say I wasn't enthused to see this film wouldn't be a lie. I saw the first one and thought it was very well done, but I just wasn't buying the concept for the second film. The concept, however, worked wonderfully and some of the food animals are deemed the best part of the film, especially a little strawberry named Barry, who is just as cute as any cartoon character you've seen before. He has the best scenes in the film and will put a smile on anyone face.The actors in the film voice their characters with energy and hilarity. Some of the actors make it impossible for you not to laugh. Some of the highlights are Andy Samberg and Terry Crews, who voice Flint's goofy friends Brent McHale, who dons a chicken costume for most of the film and calls himself Chicken Brent, and Officer Earl Devereaux, a cop that takes his job very seriously. My only issue was with the villain, Chester V. He didn't really do much and I felt to be pretty annoying. He didn't really seem to fit in with the colourful, energetic characters. He, at some points, took a little bit of the energy out of certain scenes. Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2 is great night out with the family. It'll make you laugh, but it may scare younger children. The scary food monsters have good intentions, but some kids may not understand that at the beginning and may get overwhelmed by the loud roars and overall appearance. I was pleasantly surprised with how this film turned out and to say their won't be a third helping to this franchise would probably be a lie, but I won't let it down so easily next time. If you love films like Shrek and you've seen the first Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, be sure to check out this hilarious follow up. I guarantee you'll have a smile on your face at some point during the film.Grade: B+Please be sure to check out my reviews and Entertainment posts on www.themovieboy77.com."
70,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,3,11 August 2014,Just didn't have enough materials and creativity for a sequel,"I really really enjoyed the first ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and was looking forward for a sequel. However, if there just isn't enough materials or creative ideas to make a sequel, it's better to not go through with it. This movie is riddled with lots and lots of puns and that is probably why this movie got green-lit in the first place. Because this movie all around had no creativity and everything just seemed forced. The movie is around an hour and 30 minutes but felt longer. With a story that just seemed so forced with little to no substance. Just the group going through a forest full of food that came alive. Now that I think about it, the plot doesn't make any sense either. I was just bored with this one and didn't get even close to the entertainment value I was looking forward for. I recommend people to just watch the first one and pass on this one.3.8/10"
71,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,1,30 April 2014,Food Coma!,"*Barf Barf Barf Barf!*This whole film makes me want to go on diet or just fast altogether! It was bad enough in the first film that food eventually came to life, but now everything is alive and with bad pun names: cheesespider, shrimpanzee, bananostrich, and so on! The only other movie to rival these bad puns is Foodfight!The villain clearly played off of Up! Flint is a big fan of a super intelligent Chester V who turns corrupt, only in his case he is corrupt. It is your basic Jurassic Park: Lost World story about how man is cruel to nature and how animals mean no harm whatsoever! I wouldn't mind the message so much if the story was subtle, but it was loudly in your face and made Bambi look more subtle! In fact, take a wild guess at what Chester's corporation logo is called: Evil Corp! I'm not kidding! How in your face about how man is evil! In fact his plan is to make the ""foodimals"" into food bars! Oh so eating is evil. I get it is semi creative, but I'm tired of the ""Man is evil towards nature"" message shoved in movies like the Yogi Bear Movie and the previous Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs movie. The only thing nice about the film is the design of the food island, and at the end the father and son go fishing. That's it!The sequel books are nothing like this film and they were nicer than the movie, more appetizing, more creative, and less clich√©! I am sick to death of movies that trash the original books and replace their original ideas with Hollywood clich√©s! You don't need a full meal to be in a food coma, this flick is a food coma in itself!"
72,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,24 November 2013,Cloudy with a chance of Humour,"When I heard about this sequel, admittedly I was screaming.....WHY??? However after watching the film, I soon began to understand. The story is set after the first one, where Flint (Bill Hader) is now working for his Idol, however he soon discovers that his machine he created in the first movie, is still operational and is producing menacing food-animal hybrids. Yes, I agree it sounds crazy right? However it does allow the film to be funny through the various animal puns, for example a 'Shrimpanzee' and many many more. The first movie I felt was clever, whereas this one I feel is based on more of the humour elements. The hybrids are sweet as well as very clever, and I feel that they make the movie work. Flint is still as clumsy and crazy as ever, and thankfully some of the characters from the first film have more screen time, the only actor absent is Mr T, however Terry Crews still delivers a very funny performance as the policeman. I haven't seen this in 3D however I could see how elements will be awesome to see, though it delivers just as good in 2D. Its fun, enjoyable, paves way for a third and is suitable for all audiences.http://joshwhitnallfilmreviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
73,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,21 October 2013,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 was amusing enough though no great shakes,"Just watched this computer animated movie with my movie theatre-working friend. I remember thinking the original one was quite funny with much to recommend it. This one has some good moments of humor and is at the least as pleasingly visual as the first one though a bit underwhelming compared to the previous one. Obviously, the fact the first one made money was the reason this sequel was made but all they could think of was having these food creatures be supposedly monsters only when provoked by an-eventually revealed-evil scientist who happens to be the main character's idol and this main character then abandons his friends because of such idolizing? Not very original, still there is a nice enough lesson there for the kids and the visual jokes are amusing enough so on that note, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is worth a look."
74,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,8 October 2013,you got a really good chance...,"I watch the first one 3 years ago and its so good, I really love the first one very much. But, its sequel... honestly I don't know that they will make the sequel until I saw its trailer on IMDb and in deep of my heart I'm keep saying that I'm gonna watch this one, its looks so fluffy! Till it came to my country, I and my friend go watch this in 2D cinema. Yeah, sometime we laugh sometime we're not, and of course the animation is so cute but I think it's not work for us adult, its just for children. There is some character here like minion in ""Despicable Me"" that looks very cute and hilarious but I found it clich√©, yeah they're cute but not so funny as you can see in ""Ice Age"", Scrat the Troublemaker. It's not bad for kid's movie, take your kid and they will very love this movie but if you are an adult, its depends. They got a really good chance to make this movie big but maybe 3 years is not enough to develop the story or to make something that's different from other everyday USA animation movie. 2 words, cute movie."
75,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,10,17 January 2014,It's delicious,"This movie is fantastic! It has a strong moral core about friendship, memorable characters, and does what animation should do, which is show the fantastical: Living food. The animation colour and design are extraordinary, fun, vivid. The food and the situations reference older films which adds something more adults can enjoy. Simply put, this film is fun -- and much better than the first one. About the references, a lot of animation today makes quick cultural jabs that fall flat the next year. This film heavily references situations, for example, Steve Jobs' decision to pay the Chinese a pittance and reap a huge profit, but not in such a way that can date the film in the 20 or 40 years. It's there. It's easy to see, but the allusions blend into the landscape seamlessly. It's very well done.I gave it a ten, not for the reason I gave ten for Monoke Hime but for showing me a fantastical bright world that I would love to visit and populating it with quirky characters that made me laugh and were just thoughtful enough to not be one dimensional."
76,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,6,29 October 2013,Pleasant and fun sequel if not very consistent or necessary,"The first film was great fun, a little rushed but colourful, hilarious and quite inventive in visuals and humour. This sequel is enjoyable, unnecessary perhaps but there have been far worse animated sequels around(as well as better). The story is half-baked and reads of predictable left-overs; Bill Hader's voice acting can sound over-compensated; the drama can get a little too sentimental at times- especially when getting its well-intended but a mite heavy-handed messaging across- which can bog down the film; and it lacks the spontaneity and very razor-sharp timing of the original(though not entirely devoid of those qualities) with some hit-and-miss puns, most are very enjoyably daft but others are too obvious and hastily timed. However the animation is great, the bright vibrant colours, inventive visuals of the food and food machines, colourful landscapes and well-designed characters are lovely to watch. The catchy soundtrack also delights, it'll leave your toes stepping, your face smiling and you in a good mood. Not all the writing works but when it does there are some really fun sight gags that come by thick and fast though with enough time for you to savour them, delightfully surreal ""foodimals"" and some snappy if daft puns(when they're not too obvious). The highlights are the fishing trip and with the monkey Steve. The characters are engaging still, the pacing apart from some lulls in the more dramatic moments zips along and the voice work on the whole is terrific with only Hader sounding overdone. Overall lacks the consistency of the first and not as spontaneous, you may also argue whether it was necessary to have a sequel anyway, but Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 for me was pleasant, fun and colourful, but with a fair few things that could have been better. Not among Monsters University, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2, Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, Despicable Me 2 or The Croods as among the best animated features of 2013 but far better than Sir Billi, My Little Pony: Equestria Girls, Planes, Justin and the Knights of Valour and Escape from Planet Earth. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
77,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,,18 October 2013,great movie,"great movie for all ages. It's a must see.

I hope some one can comment on the first one. we are hoping it's just as good as the second one. my kid's must have watched Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 twenty time's. my wife and i have watched Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 three time's. my kid's are getting ready to watch Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 again.like i said my family and i say it's a must watch. thumb's all the way up for Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2."
78,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,12 October 2013,"In this second part of the story, food becomes an ecosystem of living, breathing animals and there is only one person that can stop this.","I liked the first part, but I'm telling you - this second part is far more memorable. I had a lot of fun watching it and although I felt no real connection to the characters, it made my Saturday evening a lot more beautiful than I expected. I know it's just a Hollywood animation trifle, and not a particularly original one, but nevertheless, it's such a crazy script that you simply cannot stop liking it. I am surprised that as I am writing this it has only grade 6 going to 7 from the users. I've seen far worse animations that got more. The scientist, his girlfriend the weather reporter, his not so intelligent, but very wise father and the rest of the crew around the main character make a great mix of fun. And that's all to it, whoever searches for more from such a movie obviously had no idea to what kind of movie he/she was going."
79,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,,4 October 2013,An appetizing treat of a sequel.,"It is refreshing to report that the only uninspired thing about ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" is it's dull generic title. The rest of the movie is a joyful work of imagination, silliness and a harmless fun. In the case of both films, with the 2009 original and the sequel, the filmmakers put their collective heads to work building on a story (namely Ron and Judi Barrett's 1978 children's book) that had virtually no plot whatsoever. What came of the earlier film was a nice surprise, a disaster movie with gravy on the side. In the sequel, they have built on that flimsy idea (while avoiding any connection with the book's sequel, ""Pickles to Pittsburgh"") and come up with a follow-up that isn't just repeating the same old formula.If you recall, the original dealt with a machine designed by junior scientist Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) called The Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator, or FLDSMDFR, that caused giant food to rain from the sky, burying his hometown island of Swallow Falls under pizza, spaghetti, pancakes and hamburgers. This sequel deals with its after effects. Flint's hometown is still buried under mountains of giant food, so he moves away from the island, to work for his hero, a flimsy-limbed super-scientist named Chester V (voiced by Will Forte, but looking very much like Mythbusters' Adam Savage). Chester runs a giant corporation called Live Corp. (read the first part of that title backwards) and sends Flint and his friends back to the island to turn off the FLDSMDFR because the invention has started imbuing its gastronomical creations with sentience, leading to an entire edible ecosystem.Amid this edible population, Chester's main concern are the cheespiders ¬ñ large cheeseburgers with French fry legs that are learning to swim. If they can swim, they'll reach the mainlands of Europe, Africa, and North and South America. It's up to Flint to turn off his machine before it can do anymore damage. It doesn't take much to understand what Chester is up to or what the outcome will be. It hardly matters, this isn't a movie about plot, it's about visual delight.You can see that the animators were given free reign over the populace here and they didn't just stop at the obvious. This is a movie in which they have taken their sequel and moved it in a different direction rather than just repeat the original. They stretch the animated form into something really special here. There's always something new to behold.It has been a year of dry sauce for the animated feature. Lots of products, but little imagination. Of the films released in the past 9 months, only this film and ""Monsters University"" have really been special. There are nice messages about the importance of friendship and respecting the environment without beating you over the head. Will kids enjoy it? Absolutely. Is it funny? You bet. The humor is light and funny, and not overly-crude (there's a joke about cutting the cheese that is quite literal), and it is a lot of fun. This may not be any kind of a masterpiece but it's a work of imagination that feeds your appetite to be entertained.***1/2 (of four)"

81,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,9,17 October 2014,The food is so freaking cute!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't get over it!!,"Notice how many explication marks I used? There's a reason for that. It's because I love this movie. The main reason is because the food animals, or food-imals, are so freaking adorable that I can't even stand it and I definitely can't get over it. The strawberry. Oh my God, the strawberry. I want it. I want it to be real and be my best friend. And that is in no way sad, because if you had seen it, you would understand it and agree with me.In this episode, Flint starts working at The Live Corp Company, but they really just want him there, to find out where his food invention is. When he's sent on a mission to retrieve it, thinking they want it for another reason, he goes back to his hometown island. Live Corp makes Flint believe that they want to protect the mainland from being attacked by living food. They really want it to use it on their own food inventions, to make them taste better. We see adorable food- imals such as talking strawberries, flamangos, hippotatomuses, shrimpanzees, cheespiders, bananostrich's and watermelophants, just to name a few. I love them, I want them to be my best friends. They help make Flint and his friends realise that Live Corp is bad, and they find a way to save all the food-imals.Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10."
82,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,8,11 August 2014,http://trust-the-dice.blogspot.com/,"Just a couple of hours ago, Flint saved the world! Sure, it was from one of his own inventions, but that's cheese under the bridge. Now, he's on top of the world! He's got plans with his friends to open a company! That's when his childhood idol comes into the picture and offers him a dream job as an inventor.The first movie isn't on Netflix. It's a shame, but not necessary. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is kind enough to give viewers a recap of what happened in the first movie. Not a bad idea, since there were four years between the first and second one. I wasn't necessarily in love with the first film, but I thought it was cute and the plot had some merit. There was a good message for kids in it about dreams and accepting people as they are. Good stuff, honestly. It was definitely weird, but not necessarily in a bad way.I much prefer the second one. The sneaky jokes geared just toward the adults were appreciated and made me believe that parents would likely be happy to watch Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 with their kids. At least the first twelve times. Then the DVD might well get lost or ""accidentally"" broken. I think that goes for most movies though.Like the first film, this one had a message for the kidlets. Any version of ""don't judge a book by its cover"" or ""don't believe everything you hear"" would aptly describe the main lesson, though there was the obvious push to trust one's friends. Personally, I liked the way they handled the former. It made me think of the plight of pit bulls, a cause that's very near and dear to my heart. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is a cute and funny movie that does its best to appeal to adults as well as kids. To me, it's the purest definition of ""family film."""
83,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,,28 December 2013,nice,"after the serious first part, the second is more than an honorable animation. it is pure fun, splendid characters, interesting script and a lovely joy for kids. the food has new role. the friendship - new nuances. and the adventure new forms. a film who seems be a crazy party and fascinating work of imagination. the secret - smart use of clich√©s, the science to create a show who represents more than story itself. and, sure, the music. a lot of classic animation spirit and inspired answer to many and different expectations. a nice film. and a precise art for give new images about heroism. and reality. short, a really interesting movie. for each age."
84,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,5,23 December 2013,A Delicious Sequel,"Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs (2009) was a very welcome entry to the animated film genre, with an inventive and creative script, great voice acting, and humorous characters. The sequel, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2, is certainly a great one. Unfortunately, it is not as creative as its predecessor, but the humor is still present, including some funny puns. The voice acting is still fresh, with great performances from Bill Hader, Andy Samberg, and even Neil Patrick Harris as Steve the monkey, in particular. The characters are tasty and delightful like the first film, with character development added nicely to the mix. The plot, however, is not the most creative, as I stated earlier. It is predictable, and not nearly as interesting as I had hoped it would be, but the stunning visuals certainly compensate for this. A lot of work has gone in to creating those living foods, and I praise the studio for that.Overall, this second installment in the Meatballs franchise was a funny, beautiful, well-voiced sequel with, in my opinion, one fault. The kids will laugh and the adults will smile, and even they might let out a chuckle, at this hilarious sequel."
85,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,5,27 October 2013,Empty calories,"This is like the third review I've written in a few months where I say it has no soul. Is there an epidemic in Hollywood? Am I growing jaded? Here's my problem - they say there are these people and they act like this and let's put them in a funny situation where we can see all their quirks and we'll end up with a cute movie. (The other two recent movies that this resembles are War Horse and the new Percy Jackson movie, with which this shares more than a little). I didn't see the first installment in this franchise but I suspect I didn't need to (another tell), it's just this guy does this and it's sort of funny than this girl does this and it's cute. I'm not close to being involved and actually fell asleep several times, something I don't think I ever did before in a theater. When it's over it's like gee glad that's over. Let me add one more similar movie - The Croods, and a bunch of TV shows like Barnyard, Tuff Puppy and the recent Spongebobs. My 8 year old seemed to like it, but for me it's like most of his cereals - empty calories. Unless you have an eight year old pass 'em by."

87,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,7,13 October 2013,Imaginative Animals Crossed with Food!,"In the first ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"" young scientist Flint Lockwood invents a wondrous machine he called the Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator, or FLDSMDFR, that turned water into gigantic pieces of food which later rained on and destroyed their island town of Swallow Falls.In this sequel, Flint gets conscripted by his idol Chester V, the CEO of Live Corp Company, for a mission to locate the FLDSMDFR and insert a ""BS-USB"" to deactivate it before newly-evolved vicious creatures on the island learn to swim out and destroy the rest of the world.When Flint and his friends get there, they discover that the FLDSMDFR now creates ""Foodnimals"", food turned animals with eyes, arms and legs. They range from the cute and lovable Strawberries, Marshmallows and Pickles, to large and formidable Cheespiders (cheeseburgers with french fries as legs and spin cheesy webs) and Tacodiles (tacos turned crocodiles that spew lettuce at the mouth).As conflicts arise between Chester V and Flint's girlfriend Sam Sparks, can Flint figure out the right thing to do before he does something which would destroy not only his friendships, but also a whole new fascinating world of new creatures? The writers were able to come up with one hilarious one-liner food puns in practically every other line. I recall ""There's a leek in my boat!"" and ""I will cut the cheese!"" to mention a couple. They must have exhausted every food pun in the book, and then some. There were some lame jokes too though, like about the non-wedgie underwear.The animators of CWACOM 2 really ran wild with their imaginations creating these delightful ""Foodnimals"" from the simple to the complex. They turned shrimp into chimps, bananas to ostriches, potatoes to hippos, onions to brontosauruses! This is a very visually-stimulating film. The images, the colors and the 3D was fantastic! There are some take-home messages about family, friendship and caring for wildlife and were well-appreciated. There was some word too about bullying. However, these moral lessons were presented in a funny, most entertaining fashion. This is truly a light and breezy film to be enjoyed by the whole family."
