0,Megamind,9,5 November 2010,"It's not HTTYD, but it still kicks butt!","Dreamworks is notorious for creating a combination of hits and misses - their misses can be anywhere between disappointing (Shrek 3) to just plain forgettable (Monsters vs Aliens), but you'd better believe that their hits hit HARD. Their most recent release, Megamind, coming hot of the heels of the DVD release for How to Train Your Dragon (arguably one of Dreamworks' best), is, despite its poor press, a major HIT in my book.Two aliens are placed in escape pods as infants in order to flee their respective planets, each being devoured by a black hole. One, a well-groomed humanoid with extraordinary powers, crash-lands into the lap of luxury on Earth - the other, a blue, big-headed baby, falls not far away, right into a prison yard. Each a product of their upbringing, the two boys form an intense rivalry in their school (or ""shool"") days, as one becomes the egotistical, he-man hero of the classroom, and the other quickly devolves into an outcast. This latter child, fed up with trying to gain acceptance, decides to turn villain on his rival - when the boys become men, they name themselves Metro Man (Brad Pitt) and Megamind (Will Ferrell), and engage in constant battles set in Metro City. One day, when Megamind actually succeeds in killing the famed superhero, he takes control of the city, turning it into a den of chaos. However, without a hero to fight, Megamind feels that he has lost his purpose, and seeks to create a new hero and rival to liven up his life again.This movie works for 3 main reasons - first, the characters. Will Ferrell as Megamind is simply brilliant; flawed but lovable, we pity the guy for all the crap he took that drove him to villainy, we appreciate his intelligence while still laughing at his screw-ups and flamboyant nature. Surprisingly enough, what could've easily just been a purely comic protagonist became a 3-dimensional character, and you actually get to care deeply for him. Brad Pitt's small but memorable role as Metro Man provides great comedy and a snide parody of a certain Man of Steel. And let's not forget Roxanne Ritchi, voiced by Tina Fey - your typical Lois Lane damsel-in-distress. While Roxanne *does* seem to get kidnapped a lot, she never loses her cool... mainly because Megamind simply doesn't threaten her. She's brave, but she still gets scared. She's smart, but she can make stupid mistakes. She's kind and a bit naive without losing that snarky grin. She isn't the *most* rounded heroine out there, but she has her moments, and overall, she's a pretty likable character. Jonah Hill and David Cross are also great, of course, with Hill's character of Hal being oddly 3-dimensional himself, and Cross' being little more than a voice-of-reason for Megamind to play off of.The second thing that keeps Megamind from crashing is the script - it's genuinely funny and heartfelt without seeming pretentious. The comedic moments work because they really are funny. The serious moments work because they have genuine heart - they balance solemn with sweet with sad, all without losing that honest streak that ties them together. When Megamind hurts, you truly feel his pain, and even if it doesn't exactly tug your heart-strings, it definitely serves to further your emotional investment in the movie.And finally, the animation is just awesome. 'Nuff said. I saw it in 2D, but based on what I saw, the 3D showing would be well worth it.Truly one of Dreamworks' hits, Megamind captures just the right combination of crazy humour and lovable characters to create a, dare I say it, MEGA-AWESOME film that kids and adults can both enjoy. 9/10"
1,Megamind,10,12 August 2011,Possibly The New Shrek!,"I don't remember the last time I enjoyed an animated movie this much! One reason being the gorgeous 3D animation-I mean...look at Minion's dome! I was gee-king inside and out on how detailed this movie is from the characters to the scenery. Every time I watch the movie, I always spot something new! Megamind shouldn't have been advertised as a full blown comedy, because this movie held plenty of deep lessons to be learned and so laughter was a little on the offside at times, but those tender moments were probably the best part of the movie! Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and especially David Cross impressed me with their voice acting talent! I felt as though they ARE the characters...it just felt real to me.Megamind has a lot of great lines and is a great family film! A must see!"
2,Megamind,9,7 November 2010,Don't miss it...,"I have read some reviews here and see it being unfairly compared to some Pixar's... I would rather rate it on its own merit. When I am sitting in a theater I would rather watch the current movie than try and compare it with others I have seen before. I guess that is just me! So here goes. It is worth a watch (or two if your kids want you to). The story is built up on a traditional superhero concept inspired heavily from the first ""Superman"" movie to the ""Return of Superman"". However, the jokes are often original and some can get an LOL out of you. All in all, there is enough good humor sprinkled throughout the movie to keep everyone smiling.If you can, do watch the 3D version. It has some good action scenes which look great in 3D but if not, you aren't missing a lot. This is not one created specifically for 3D pleasure - unlike Dreamwork's ""How to train your dragon"". Do watch out for some great dialogs by Megamind, and even some cutesy ones that seem right out of a Dilbert strip (office humor, if it wasn't clear enough). My favorite is ""He is still not used to positive feedback"" :) (probably funnier in context.All in all an entertaining package."
3,Megamind,8,23 December 2010,Megamind is the Charlie Brown of super villains.,"I am so glad that animated movies are coming back into their own. In the past few years we've seen some really good ones like Despicable Me and How to Train Your Dragon and now we have Megamind. The animation is great but what gets this film 4 stars is the fact that while the animation adds to the movie, it is only one aspect of the film's appeal. The dialog and characterization are strong too.It is, of course, the thinly disguised story of Superman, but told from his arch enemie's(Lex Luthor) point of view. It's also a look at what happens when society fails a child who just doesn't fit neatly into a pigeon hole. Because Megamind is different than his peers(because of his looks and intelligence) he relates to them a bit awkwardly which in turn makes him feel even more different and alienated. At some point he reasons that if he is treated like a bad kid, that he might as well be a bad kid, and "" MegaMind, incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy! "" was born.Megamind is also pretty even handed. When characters in this movie are bad,or cowardly, or act in ways that are beneath them, it's for an understandable human reason. I think the movie makes the argument that if people could reach a more mutual understanding of each other, then we might be able to start to eliminate much(but not all) of the evil and misery in this world. It has real heart That's just the underlying philosophy though. It's nowhere nearly as preachy as I might be making it sound. The movie is peppered with cool references to various Superman incarnations and plenty of humor.The animation is fantastic, especially Megamind's ""Death Blimp"". I saw it for the first time with a huge audience which consisted of both older animation fans and young families and everyone had a great time. I looked around occassioanlly and saw people of every description laughing through out the movie. There is something for everyone to enjoy in Megamind. It's a guaranteed good time for anyone with a heart beat.(Honestly, even the undead would probably crack a smile here and there.)"
4,Megamind,10,18 November 2010,I Love Megamind!!,"I tend to watch all the new animated movies that come out nowadays. It's simply amazing to watch each new advancement with each new movie. Megamind truly was enjoyable to watch, all the details and small touches made it a wonderful show. Just the right amount of humor and seriousness, with a strong love interest. It's everything I was looking for in a movie. The character, Megamind himself, voiced with Will Ferrel makes him seriously lovable, how can we not love a silly underdog trying his best? Music for the movie I felt was perfect picks for each type of scene, they seem to give the movie much more power! I want to see much more of these characters, I've already seen it a few times in the theaters, 3D and normal, each time unforgettable!Please Dreamworks, keep going with this one, its a true winner in my book, I would just love to see more!!"
5,Megamind,9,11 November 2010,Absolutely Amazing and Funny Movie!,"First off, I must say that I am guilty of ""judging a movie"" by its trailers. I have to say it was a pretty good movie because the theatre was literally roaring with laughter.. I even caught myself crying laughing at one point. That's how funny it was. What's funny about it is that it is played out in great animation with an excellently cast (Tina Fey, Will Ferell, Brad Pitt, and Jonah Hill) brewed together to make an excellent superhero movie or spoof rather.I thought it was going to be lame, but boy was I definitely wrong, I can't say enough! I loved every moment of it and the whole good vs. evil concept was intricately woven in a different way. It was very Creative the way they rolled out the story to viewers."
6,Megamind,9,5 November 2010,An enjoyable animation for adults and kids alike,"I watched this movie tonight with my wife and kids, we really enjoyed this a lot, i found myself actually attached to the characters and intrigued by the plot. i also found myself entertained with the action scenes. my kids also enjoyed it, more so than they enjoyed the lame Alpha and Omega. I guess most of you know what the plot is, so i won't go into it. it is just fun and involves super powers and super heros battles. most of you are probably reading this to decide whether to go and see it or not, let me say, go ahead, it is worth it and enjoyable !! And i also like to add, we watched it in 2D, so im not sure how it is in 3D, but im assuming just as good if not better."
7,Megamind,9,22 February 2011,Different and an entertaining super hero story,"As we all know Pixar and Dreamworks are two of the best studios producing amazingly awesome animated movies. There have been few misses but megamind is not one of those. With dreamworks releasing some fantastic and original movies in the recent past like kung fu panda and how to train your dragon I knew I had to see this one since it came out and I finally got time to watch it now.Although it felt like one of the typical genre of super hero films, but with all those elements put together and a super brilliant character, MEGAMIND, who is a little flawed and evil, but is also lovable, earns our pity and ""gets the girl in the end"". It was smart, intelligent, witty and a well written story. The voice acting and animation were perfectly suited to the movie. I love how these studios pull such great emotions even with animated characters. When Roxanne leaves Megamind, you yourself will feel his pain which he shows with his eyes. I just love it..!!! This movie had some great around laughs and took a different spin at some conventional superhero movies and gave us a great surprise which I am sure you all would enjoy. This flick is for all ages. Right mixture of humour, seriousness and also a little suspense with a strong love interest will keep you laughing and entertained throughout the movie and the superb action and flying scenes which are very exciting, I feel, are made mostly for the ""3d"" experience but nonetheless its equally enjoyable in 2d. But 3d complemented the movie without being a distraction or annoyance. I guess it's everything I was looking for in a movie.Also, the movie vividly captured many awkward and tragic human situations in a way only animation can. Like how society sometimes fails to accept a child who is different than his peers(because of his looks and intelligence) and just doesn't fit and he relates to them a bit awkwardly which in turn makes him feel alienated. In the movie MEGAMIND reasons that if he is treated like a bad kid, then he might as well be a bad kid, and thus takes place birth of an intelligent, genius criminal or as he says ""SUPER-VILLIAN"".There's seriously nothing to complain about the movie except that I wanted it to go on for a little longer maybe.Overall, a funny, exciting, entertaining and a really MEGA-AWESOME film that kids and parents, both, can enjoy and I would really like DREAMWORKS to keep going on with this and I am sure they will.Enjoy. ;)"
8,Megamind,10,4 April 2011,Putting the Mind in MEGAMIND,"Let me begin this review by saying that I was very pleasantly surprised with 'Megamind.' I was not expecting much beyond what we've all seen in the trailers: cheeky laughs, slapstick humor, and the like. While it is certainly all there and accounted for, I was very surprised by the level of humanity and realism underneath the misleading facade of colorful, CG images which might have implied this would be a kid's movie and nothing more. Some of the great parts of the movie are present in the first few minutes of the film, where we see how Megamind came to be a villain. We see a baby Megamind being carried by his parents, who tell him that he was destined to become something, though he doesn't remember what. He is sent to Earth at the same time as Metro Man, his opposite and future rival. As fate has it, the baby Metro Man crash lands in a rich family's house while baby Megamind crash lands in a prison. They are raised in their new homes, causing them to become what their environments expect them to become. This bit in which the babies are seemingly thrown into a place where they seemingly 'belong' sets the stage for a great exploration of the theme of identity and destiny, and begs the question of whether we have roles to play or whether we directly choose our own paths. Not much later, we see an older Megamind dealing with another problem that we should all be able relate to--the desire to be accepted by society. It is especially difficult for Megamind, being a the only blue alien among his many peers at school, while his rival, Metro Man, seems to always be the object of favor. As we get to understand Megamind's reasons for being a villain, there's an excellent example of role reversal--we perceive the 'bad guy,' Megamind, as the good guy, because we can relate to his problems and understand the motivation behind his actions. We also see the 'good guy', Metro Man, as the bad guy, because he is, ironically, less human than Megamind--Metro Man is without flaw, and is without any understanding or sympathy for Megamind. A good example is one of the earlier scenes, where Megamind accidentally starts a fire when he attempts to use a ray gun to pop corn for his classmates. Metro Man saves the class by extinguishing the fire, and he is praised while everyone shuns Megamind. Metro man and the class look past Megamind's intentions to be good, and only at the fact that a fire has been started from his attempt. They see Megamind in an unfortunately prejudiced way, and they don't consider the motivation for his actions, but only results of the actions themselves. At that moment, Megamind feels that he and Metro man are destined to have specific roles as the bad guy and the good guy. The whole beginning sequence on the earlier years of Megamind works for well, packing a lot of humanity into first the few minutes. This is great for several reasons--we are immediately to connect to and root for our main character, Megamind, and none of it feels rushed. We immediately understand his jealousy and his desire to be accepted and have his own role--he decides that if he can't be perfect like Metro man, he will try to be what he is 'good' at--being bad. It also enables the rest of the film to explore the development of Megamind's established character and whether he is really stuck with the 'role' he's been given--and it all plays out very well as he discovers the path to one's destiny and identity with his rival Metro Man and his love interest, Roxanne. The film is also legitimately funny on multiple occasions! In short, I believe Megamind is a mega-masterpiece, and that it is also very thoughtful, putting the 'mind' in MEGAMIND."
9,Megamind,10,28 December 2010,one of the best movies i've seen in the past few years or so.,"There's nothing to complain about this movie. And the story was original, actually just great if you keep in mind that it is a feel good movie. Really love to see how people can still come up with good and original stories that still have a happy ending, much like the latest Shrek movie. And the music was just great (again much like the latest Shrek movie), classics such as Back in Black, Highway to Hell, Crazy Train and Cobrastyle really made me love this movie like maddd. The people at DreamWorks are obviously pure genius. I might just be a dutch 15 year old, but you are crazy if you don't like this movie.recap: - Original - Unexpected twists - Good music10 stars!"
10,Megamind,8,14 November 2010,sick animated  flick,if your looking for a good old time and lots of laughs. I suggest you watch Megamind. This movie had all around laughs and took a different spin at superhero movies and gave us a great surprise that i know you would all enjoy. This flick is for all ages. Me and wife enjoyed it even thou we have no kids. I give Megamind five thumbs up . Hope you get to enjoy this wonderful movie. Make sure to bring someone you will enjoy being a kid with again . love it love it love it!!! hope to see more flicks come like this in the future. it seems that animated flicks have come a long way and continue to grow and become great movies of all time.thank you all.
11,Megamind,9,24 June 2012,A well developed movie for adults and kids,"Every so often I watch a film with limited enthusiasm, simply because I have time me to kill. On these occasions I sometimes stumble across a true delight and am pleasantly surprised...a film that maybe had ""mixed"" reviews or that received little attention upon its release. Megamind is such a film; a great work of animation and character development.The film should delight adults and children with enough in it to satisfy all tastes. There is also plenty of amusing and hilarious satire with regard to superhero movies and super villains. Many superheros and villains are often depicted as wholly good or wholly bad, having at best some traumatic event setting them on their inevitable and unchangeable course. This film actually highlights certain sources of inner turmoil and insecurities of the characters in a very entertaining way and develops the characters as they work these out.There's also plenty of rip roaring action on the way.Great stuff! Highly recommended!"
12,Megamind,10,13 November 2010,Some villains are born to be heroes.,"Megamind, the big-headed alien always picked the last and took for granted while his rival Metroman was the school popular and the handsome boy who everyone wanted to be his friend are always in a conflict and everyone favoring Metroman, Megamind takes this chance to be a villain and extract revenge upon his rival.Seeing the cast was quite the surprise seeing Will Farrell, Brad Pitt and Tina Fey, while i'm a huge fan of Farrell i went to this movie and it was really good, voice acting is top notch, the comedy stands out and i really liked the soundtrack since most of the songs are old-school.This movie is recommended for everyone you will laugh and Will Farrell will draw smiles on the audience, if you get the chance to see it in 3D then go for it since the action scenes are powerful and breathtaking."
13,Megamind,7,23 December 2010,Funny enough to keep you watching for more,"This film was very funny and i feel the cast was chosen very well there was a lot of character development which added depth to the growing relationship of Megamind and Roxanne(Fay.although it felt it fit the typical genre of super hero comic book films and a lot of people will find it to be not like despicable me that does nothing to reduce in the quality of the script. The comedy was good with all the parent laughing to the jokes, like the reference to the God-father etc.I think overall the film will be able to reach out to kids and parents alike the twists will keep you seated till the end. The moral of the story Destiny is the path you chose not what is chosen for you, 7.5/10 a good family film"
14,Megamind,,23 November 2012,Where'd you park the invisible car?,"""Megamind"" stars Will Ferrell as ""Megamind"", a super-villain who delights in his daily feuds with local superhero Metro Man. Metro Man is played by Brad Pitt, his character a suave, debonair and hilariously cheesy ode to all things manly. Megamind, meanwhile, is your classic superhero villain, only fifty times cooler and a hundred times more slick. Forget Heath Ledger's overrated Joker. Megamind's where it at. The guy struts about like a cocksure peacock, smoke machines, Black Sabbath, AC/DC and strobe lighting forever heralding his oncoming awesomeness. Megamind understands the showmanship of villainy. The wild, ego-maniacal, unbridled jouissance of it all. The guy's Id unleashed. You can almost smell his cool. He also wears mascara.""Megamind"" is also a bit deeper than your typical superhero flick. Here the villain, Megamind, is shown to be a byproduct of both the city which ostracises him and the ""good guys"" who bully him. Metro Man is himself a giant egotistical jerk whose craving for power is a result of his own abusive, absent parents. Meanwhile, most of the film charters how crime and law, superhero and super-villain, all function as a kind of self-sustaining feedback loop. Late in the picture another character, a socially and sexually rejected kid who is abused by both our hero and villain, himself becomes a violent super villain. The film is unique in that it positions us to sympathise with villainy and explicitly shows how abuse is oft internalised and then redirected.Mostly, though, the film is simply cool. Megamind moves like an 1980s heavy metal rock-star. He's obsessed with ""presentation"", his cape frequently fluttering to some blazing Guns n Roses track. The rest of the film pokes fun at overcooked superhero clichés. Its female love interest, for example, is modelled on DC comics' Lois Lane, and Megamind's dad is a nod to Brando's Kal-El. Elsewhere the film, which is almost always funny, parodies glam rock and comic book tropes. As computer animation allows for a kind of hyper fine-tuning, the film's virtual camera work and virtual action sequences are machine precise.8.5/10  As Pixar drowns in phony syrup, DreamWorks Animation seems to get better. Worth two viewings."
15,Megamind,7,9 June 2011,A Funny Animation with a Parody to the Origins of Superman and a Satire to Superhero Movies,"When a planet is near to be destroyed, two alien offspring are saved by their parents that launch them to the space in pods. Their fate on Earth is opposite: one that is a beautiful baby with superpowers crashes in the lawn of a mansion, while the other that is ugly and blue with a big head crashes in a prison yard with his companion Minion. They are raised in different environments of the Metro City but studying in the same school for gifted children. While one becomes popular but selfish and egocentric, the other is absolutely outcast by the other students. They become enemies and when they grow-up, the population knows them as the superhero Metro Man and the villain Megamind. In their fights, Megamind always loses and ends in prison; however, Megamind develops a ray that kills Metro Man, reducing him to a skeleton. After a short period, Megamind feels bored without the battles against Metro Man. Meanwhile he dates the field reporter Roxanne Ritchie, who works with the cameraman Hal Stewart, using the identity of Bernard and sooner they fall in love with each other. When Megamind decides to create another superhero to become his opponent, he accidentally transforms Al Stewart in Titan expecting that he would use his powers for good. However, Titan becomes greed and evil and destroys Metro City. Now Megamind is the only hope to save the world from the mean Titan.""Megamind"" is a funny animation with a parody to the origins of Superman and a satire to superhero movies with an adorable villain. The bad lucky of Megaman, who is oriented by outlaws, plus the prejudice of his mates against his ugly appearance turns him into a quite bad character. However, he is not actually evil but a misguided alien that has the chance for redemption. The voices of Will Ferrell, Tina Fey and David Cross give life and humor to delightful characters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Megamente"""
16,Megamind,8,6 November 2010,Flying Cinema,"The trailers of ""Megamind"" is like your same old typical Dreamworks Animated Movie. Slapstick comedy, simple story, less heart. But the movie turns out to be good. It's a solid entertainment, a lot of action and laughs. The best thing about this film is the flying sequence. You don't need to watch this in 3D because in 2D cinema you already feel like you are flying. ""Megamind"" is fun and non-stop entertainment. Like I say, 2010 is the best year for animated movies.The story is like ""What will happen if the villain defeated the hero?"". Without the main superhero, the main villain will be a good guy. The story is interesting but it's predictable sometimes. At least the movie is fun. The jokes were funny (duh it's Dreamworks). The entertainment quality is great. I'm not against 3D but you don't need to see this in 3D. It's already exciting and fun in 2D.It's not like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or ""Kung Fu Panda"" that it's very heartwarming. ""Megamind"" has a heart but not as big as the movies i have mentioned. The filmmaking is decent. Hans Zimmer's music is always great. The action and flying scenes are very exciting. Also the voice acting was pretty good. Will Ferrel's voice reminded me of Rainn Wilson's Gallaxhar on last year's ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" and also the appearance of the character. But his voice acting was good though.Overall the movie is very enjoyable. It could be one of the best animated films of the year. It's not your typical Dreamworks except the trailer. The movie is short but it's undeniably entertaining. It's a movie you can repeat all over again like ""HTTYD"", ""Shrek"", and ""KFP"" but not as heartwarming as those three. It's like ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" with heart."
17,Megamind,,11 January 2011,"You'll probably laugh, and you'll probably wish it were better.","You'll probably laugh, and you'll probably wish it were better. Megamind is nothing more than a amiable-enough adventure about atonement, about choosing to be the person you want to be regardless of what others expect of you. I'd love it a lot more if the Pixarian themes had been developed with greater care; as it is, they come across as an reconsideration. The jokes range from the modestly amusing to the mildly dumb. It's a harmless, inoffensive, moderately likable throwaway of a cartoon that you will probably start forgetting as soon as it's over.It may be difficult to find uniqueness in Megamind but it's also hard not to like."
18,Megamind,,10 July 2010,Fun but not Pixar,"Saw this at a test screening. It wasn't completely finished in terms of animation, much of it was in storyboard phase, but from what I could tell the animation is top notch. Jonah Hill is perfect as Titan. Will Ferrell was decent as Megamind. Brad Pitt was good while he was in it.Its half spoof half turn the genre on its head. There are some pretty good jokes and some decent set ups. There's no real heart here though. Everyone's likable but you know it'll all be OK. Several scenes were very well animated, there is one of the biggest explosions ever animated in this film which was pretty cool. Go take the kids, especially the boys, who'll most likely get a kick out of Megamind."
19,Megamind,7,21 January 2015,Very good animation movie with story told from antagonist side.,I am very late watching this movie and loved this very much. Very good animation movie with story told from antagonist side.The movie is about adorable villain cannot be more cuter than this apparently. The movie is pun on Superman's story. Like in Superman story a alien baby is sent from home planet when it is getting destroyed. But also another planet from another planet is sent in similar fashion. So the main character gets being labeled as savior of the town while the other gets into trouble always and determines to be bad. Very enjoyable. Just watch it!
20,Megamind,7,23 June 2011,"Heros are out, Villains are in","I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like 2010 was the year for villains. Ever since Disney released it's classic film The Incredibles, I think people took more of an interest in the villains, what makes them tick and what their true motives are. So Dreamworks saw this idea and really took advantage. They released Despicable Me which was a huge hit and not even a couple of months later we had Megamind. It seemed like the love child of The Incredibles and Despicable Me, but I went shopping a few weeks ago and found Megamind very cheap, so I figured that I would give it a buy and see if it was worth it. I watched it this morning and even though it's not a very strong animated film, I would say that it was worth the buy. I guess it's just a great year for villains, because we're not seeing them as total baddies who just want to destroy everything and everyone, but maybe they have a soft side too and wanted to be good but their looks were a little too intimidating and their powers were just a little too over the top.Megamind is a super-intelligent alien and self-proclaimed villain of the fictional Metro City. Megamind has constantly battled and lost to his nemesis Metro Man since they both arrived on Earth as infants. On the day that Metro City dedicates a museum to Megamind and his sidekick Minion kidnap reporter Roxanne and lure Metro Man into a copper-lined room. To everyone's surprise, Metro Man is unable to escape and appears to be killed when Megamind's death ray strikes him. Megamind revels in his victory against Metro Man, but shortly after becomes depressed, his villainy having no meaning without anyone to stop him. Megamind is inspired to create a superhero by injecting a worthy target with a serum fashioned from Metro Man's DNA, granting them Metro Man's super-abilities. As Megamind is selecting his target, Roxanne sneaks into Megamind's lair; in the resulting chaos, Megamind accidentally fires the serum into Hal, Roxanne's cameraman who wasn't the brightest choice in the world. Now Megamind finds out that he may have a different destiny then just being the bad guy.When I saw the movie Despicable Me, I have to admit that I was disappointed, even though it's a good movie, I was expecting a great one. I think since my expectations were lower with Megamind, it met up with what I was expecting to see and I think I had a little bit of a better time. Dreamworks is more aimed for an adult audience vs. the kids, not only can you tell with the jokes, but with the music. The animation is pretty great, but you can tell it was very much made for this silly 3D fad we got going on. Again, I still miss our good old hand drawn animation, I think the CGI animation is just a cop out, but I suppose I should get used to it since this 3D thing is not going away for a while.The actors seemed to have a good time with the movie as well and really got into their characters and their voices didn't seem out of place. Another thing that I enjoyed about this film is that it brought out the inner dork in me with wondering what the Shredder from TMNT was like before he wanted to defeat the turtles or if the Joker and Batman originally played in the sandbox together when they were kids and Joker was just jealous of Bruce Wayne and all his wealth. I guess I need a life with that comment. But to end the comment, I would say that Megamind is very much worth the watch, especially if you loved Despicable Me. Villains are finally getting their due, the new millennium makes the heros out and the super villains in.7/10"
21,Megamind,7,22 June 2011,Will Metro City have a new champion?,"A lot better than I expected. Visually exciting with fun for all ages. Super-villain Megamind(Will Ferrell)and the metropolis hero Metro Man(Brad Pitt)have battled back and forth so many times; but Megamind thinks he has come up with the ultimate plan to defeat his goody-goody nemesis. Megamind plans on ending his losing streak by kidnapping pretty TV reporter Roxanne Ritchi(Tina Fey)and catch Metro Man in a copper death trap. With the city morning their hero, it is obvious the balance of living life is just not the same with Megamind in control. Megamind decides to create a villain to challenge and win the hearts of Metro City. By accident the new bad doer is Roxanne's cameraman Hal(Jonah Hill), who becomes Titan. Now Megamind is thinking he has a slam dunk for the first time to save the day. Well, some surprises are in store. Other voices: J.K. Simmons, David Cross, Ben Stiller and Tom McGrath."
22,Megamind,9,3 April 2011,'You're fun.' - Hilarious movie!,"Megamind is probably the best animated movie of 2010.Will Farrell plays the villain, Megamind and tells the story from near the ending and flashes back to how the story begins. I was surprised at this movie because of the amount of comedy that genuinely made me laugh out loud a lot. This movie went beyond my expectations, which was also surprising since I had a feeling it would be like Due Date and be a letdown.I won't say it's predictable, because for the most part it's not. Jonah Hill is basically the opposite of Farrell for the most of the movie. Tina Fey does a great job allowing for romance and comedy to be put on the screen while Farrell brings out a lot of comedy. Minion (played by David Cross) is quite a funny character too. I immediately realized it was David Cross after a couple lines.It's a cute movie for all the romance and it's great for kids too. It's great for adults as well. I like the reference of Superman and Batman and I liked the premise of Megamind being Lex Luthor.It's got a lot of great animation and comedic timing. I really liked the way they animated Jonah Hill to look dangerous and scary at certain points of the film. I liked the movie a lot and I would rate it as being one of the best of the year."
23,Megamind,8,19 November 2010,It's Despicable Me + Superman,"2010 has seen many animated movies with the same 3D treatment which include March's ""How to Train Your Dragon"", May's ""Shrek Forever After"", June's ""Toy Story 3"", July's ""Despicable Me"" and the recent ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"" which blasted on September. While October sees none, November's first animated film (the second one being ""Tangled"") is ""Megamind"", a similar movie to ""Despicable Me"" but in a Supermanalized version.""Megamind"" uses concepts from Superman such as a foreign planet is on the way to destruction while one little young of the species is hoped to survive and live in another planet. That's what has happened to Megamind. But the twist is that there are two outer-spaced people and the other one is Metroman, the more Superman-like person compared to Megamind. Just as Megamind was about to arrive at a royal, happy house on Earth, Metroman gets the spot first and bumps Megamind's capsule causing Megamind to end up in jail. There, Megamind learns criminal stuff and soon, when he grew up, he faces off his nemesis Metroman. But, when Metroman has lost and died, bored, Megamind creates a new super-powered hero. But, the new super-powered person didn't want to become a hero but instead a villain. Megamind, for the first time in his life, becomes a hero.Megamind is a unique character. With the big blue head, his plans are actually ingenious but is easily tricked by other people. This makes him a funny criminal rather than a scary one. He has a friend named Minion which is a fish that has a robot body. He's like Dr. Doofenshmirtz in Phineas and Ferb but slightly more intelligent and better luck.By the way, you might be wondering what Tina Fey's character does in the story. Well, her character, Roxanne Ritchi is a reporter for a newscast who supports Metroman. After Megamind impersonates as a friend of hers, she starts to have a relationship with him even after Megamind was discovered of pretending to be her friend.Of course, what fuels animated movies is the jokes. That seems to be what lacks in ""Megamind"" as the original jokes are quite a few. But, one of them was ingenious. The 3D effects were satisfying enough for me and they were quite deep enough for an average 3D movie. The animation was not so stiff and the locations and everything was very much detailed.Voice performances were excellent especially Will Ferrel's who owns the part of the titular character. Tina Fey's performance was also well and seemed to sound confident. Brad Pitt shows his talent of voice acting too. David Cross who plays Megamind's pet fish is also well and satisfying. Jonah Hill's performance as Hal or Titan was also excellent. The acting was all good. Overall, ""Megamind"" is a perfect kid's movie even though a big blue headed hero may sound scary. But, kids will definitely enjoy the film very much as I do with the lovable characters especially Megamind himself who is funny and ingenious. ""Megamind"" is truly recommended.Prince AJB's Score: 8/10Thank you for reading my review on ""Megamind"". Hope it's useful."
24,Megamind,8,30 April 2011,"Sort of like ""Despicable Me"" but for an older audience...","I think that the timing of the release of ""Megamind"" hurt it quite a bit. If you look at the revenue for this film, it really is not that impressive, as it cost nearly as much as it made. However, ""Despicable Me"", which came out shortly before ""Megamind"" made a ton of money--many times what it cost to make. Now this does not mean one film is necessarily better that the other. I really think that ""Despicable Me"" stole ""Megamind""'s thunder and people were just not interested in seeing two films about an evil genius.So what's my verdict? Well, frankly I think both films are about equally good but have a slightly different audience. ""Despicable Me"" is clearly marketed more to kids and has cuteness as its advantage. The minions from ""Despicable Me"" are magnificent and adorable. It's also a tad formulaic--but not bad at all despite the predictability. ""Megamind"", however, is more a film for teens and adults--as cuteness is not really something I'd associate with the movie. It also has a few more surprises and a more adult sense of humor. My wife and oldest daughter preferred ""Megamind"" while I preferred ""Despicable Me""--but we all agreed that both were really nice films.I could say a lot more about the film, but since it's now out on DVD and already has a ton of reviews, I'll pass. Suffice to say it's well worth seeing and is excellent entertainment."
25,Megamind,9,11 March 2011,My mind just went megamind on me!,"First of all, this movie is different from a lot of other movies. It presents the point of a view of a villain. I don't recall seeing any movie that actually illustrates to the audience, like black and white, that villains need heroes and vice versa. This movie is the first in my book.I enjoyed Despicable Me, but Megamind really surprised me. I wanted to watch an enjoyable animated movie, but I didn't expect it to be this good. I was basically wanting more by the time it was done. I couldn't guess what they were going to do with some of the subplots. At first, I thought it was going to be a cheesy movie about a villain who just turns plain good. Instead, I got something that felt more than that. It involved a lot of themes and is enjoyable for almost everyone. The music, the funny lines and the unpredictable moments made it more thrilling. I would definitely see it a second time. However, there are some flaws to this movie, such as the weird moments of how they just incorporated Minion into jail to save Megamind. How convenient... I know that this is a kids' movie, but grown ups watch animated movies too. Another part that was weird was that Metro Man kinda just gave Megamind a chance. I thought they were like enemies or at least from Metro Man's perspective. They didn't really develop on that.Megamind not only reminded me of Despecable Me, but also Charlie with the chance of Meatballs and The Incredibles. Though, Incredibles is still one of my top favorite animated movies.Megamind is probably my third favorite or second favorite animated movie of 2010. The first would definitely have to be Toy Story 3. Then, I'm not sure about How to Train Your Dragon or Megamind. It doesn't matter because they're both great!"
26,Megamind,8,5 November 2010,Excellent,wow!!! This was a great animation movie after long time and also the dream-works did a good job ..Definitely it gonna be a huge hit..This film has all of the things that needs a movie to win Suspense Romance Fight and overall hilarious!!!!!!!!!This is the one of the good movie after Avatar and how to train your dragonWhen we see the film the first scene is mega mind is falling to death but then there is twist and all over that the things written are exactly fantastic and also their costumes are wonderful.The friend of Megamind is actually a fish but even this tiny thing get beautiful outfits in this film and definitely without age limit people will love it
27,Megamind,10,10 November 2010,Awesome Family Fun!!!,"This movie is perfect for the whole family. It's hilarious and has a heart-warming storyline. Will Ferrell was awesome as Megamind, the villain and Metro Man's archenemy. On the day Metro Man is being honored by the city, Megamind breaks out of jail with the help of a talking fish named Minion and kidnaps Roxanne Ritchi. Megamind finally defeats Metro Man and takes over the city. Over time, Megamind grows bored and wants an enemy to fight. He creates a serum of Metro Man's DNA in order to create a superhero, but along the way, he disguises himself as a museum curator named Bernard and starts to fall in love with Roxanne. After he accidentally turns Roxanne's cameraman, Hal into a hero, he uses his power for evil. Megamind must stop him, save the girl, and become the hero himself. I highly recommend MEGAMIND!!!"
28,Megamind,9,14 January 2011,Mega fun!,"I don't watch many animation movies except the very famous ones that are recommended to be damn good, but I had a feeling about this one. And it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen - animation or otherwise. I would rate it on the same level as Kung Fu Panda and Ice Age 3 (9 out of 10, 10 being death by lols).The plot in itself is engaging - a supervillain get terribly bored after vanquishing his arch nemesis - the Superman-heavy character Metroman. So he goes and creates a superhero of his own in order to get back to his good-vs-evil bit. But things don't go as planned - of course - and the movie just takes of from there.The characters feel real, the humor is very refreshing and off the cuff type, not your boring predictable sitcom style based on silly exaggerations. The level of the animation seemed quite good and the voice actors are perfectly suited for their roles - Brad Pitt as the superhero Metroman, Tina Fey as the beautiful reporter who keeps getting kidnapped by the evil Megamind voiced by Will Ferrel. There's even a minion named, well Minion. Throw in a douche bag cameraman, a grumpy jail house warden and the mayor for minor bits and we have a pretty solid cast.The best part is that while the movie is constantly hilarious, the plot and the characters don't stagnate at any point. Even though some parts are predictable, they are few and you aren't really watching a thriller so that you would expect a half dozen plot twists.One final thing - the music is awesome. In fact, it sets the tone of the whole movie and the choices made go really well with the characters and the situation.All in all, a superbly made, hilariously funny, refreshingly original and enjoyable experience!"
29,Megamind,10,11 January 2011,Absolutely amazing - as good as Shrek 1 and a zillion times better than Shrek 2-4,"I created an account only to review this movie. IMO, this is the best animated movie I've ever seen! The dialogues are simply awesome, the graphics are unbelievable! Smoke scenes, lightning ... it's just too much! I've seen the movie 3 times already and I just can't get enough. If you liked the Incredibles (this movie is nothing like it!), Shrek 1, Madagascar 1, you are going to love this movie.I forced a friend of mine who doesn't like animated movies to watch this one and he absolutely loved it. We were laughing for 15 min after the movie ended! Irrespective of your age, this movie as one of the most amazing dialogues and storyline ever! Highly, highly recommended!"
30,Megamind,10,6 December 2010,A must see,"I really loved this film, it had me entertained all the way through. The main character, Megamind is very easy to relate to whatever age you are and is very handsome despite being blue with an over large head. Megamind has to use his intelligence to get by in life as he has no superpowers and he faces everyday situations such as dating, dealing with school bullies and friendships in his own quirky style. The animation was very good with great attention to detail and the voices well suited to the characters. The jokes and comedy were very original and certainly appealed to my sense of humour. All in all a very good film which I will definitely watch again."
31,Megamind,,9 June 2010,Megamind a must see!,"From the creators of Kung Fu Panda and Monsters vs. Aliens comes Megamind! I got lucky and was invited to see a test screening of this movie. It is a great movie. Yes it is animated, but it is fun and entertaining for kids and Adults. Sort of like Shrek, with that good humor that adults get. Its a fun superhero/villain movie, with good morals and lots of laughs. I think everyone would enjoy this movie. Brad Pitt does a great job. Will Ferrel is hilarious! I usually don't find him very funny but he is in this movie. If you choose not to see this movie in the theater, do yourself a favor and still rent it when it comes out on DVD. You wont regret watching it."
32,Megamind,8,6 December 2010,"Great Movie with Some Clever Twists,","Megamind is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific voice cast.Its very funny and the characters,including the villains,are very likable,certain parts are a clear parody of superhero movies,and each one is very clever and you can tell that these writers are fans.Will Ferrell was perfectly cast as Megamind,this character is unique and wacky,and it is obvious from the moment we hear him speak that no one other than Ferrell could have voiced him.The movies soundtrack is outstanding,each song is very recognizeable and used at correct moments,there are also several twists throughout the movie and for an animated family film,it is very unpredictable.Megamind is a very fun movie and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or family film. Megamind,who has been a villain since he met his nemesis back in preschool,finally defeats him,and is now the ruler of Metrocity,but he starts to find life pointless without anyone to battle,so he decides to create a new superhero while also starting a relationship with the cities news reporter in disguise as a regular human."
33,Megamind,9,16 November 2010,A great movie.,"This past weekend Husband and I saw the movie Megamind. I wasn't sure how it was going to be, but I was pleasantly surprised that: 1) Our outdated movie theatre is finally offering movies, including this one, in 3D.2) The movie was hilarious! We laughed so much throughout the movie. I'd go as far to say that it's one of the funniest movies, animated or otherwise, that we've seen in a while.The only unpleasant thing about the movie was the family behind us, where every single one of them (including the baby!) coughed loudly throughout the movie and sometimes in unison. (If I had had any cough drops or hard candy in my purse, I would have pushed them on this can't-stop-coughing family. Also, I vigorously washed my hands after the movie in irrational hopes that it might keep me from getting sick.) But coughing aside, it was a great movie.Enjoy Mark HTTP://human-teeth.com"
34,Megamind,7,10 January 2011,'Megamind' vs. 'Despicable Me'!,"'MEGAMIND': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The second CGI animated blockbuster this year to revolve around a super villain learning to be good (the other being 'DESPICABLE ME', which I watched the same day). This one comes from DreamWorks Animation and is directed by Tom McGrath (who also directed DreamWorks' 'MADAGASCAR' and it's sequel). It's written by two first time writers, Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons. It features a large voice cast of A list actors including Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, David Cross, Ben Stiller (who also served as an executive producer on the film and was originally cast in the title role) and Will Ferrell as 'Megamind' (after both Stiller and Robert Downy, Jr. backed out of the role).The film opens with an 8 day old big headed blue alien boy being sent away from his planet by his parents before it blows up. In space he crosses paths with another baby boy being sent away from another planet and they both crash on Earth. The blue alien baby lands in a prison as the other baby lands at a rich couple's house. They both attend the same school, in Metro City, with equally impressive powers (one's a genius and the other has super strength and flight) but due to the one babies rich upbringing and good looks he grows up to be an idolized superhero named Metro Man (Pitt) and the other (the blue alien) grows up to be a despised mastermind villain known as Megamind. The two have constant duels but when Megamind kills Metroman (early on in the film) he takes over the city. Although Megamind has everything he thought he ever wanted he's unhappy. He longs for a beautiful reporter (Fey, who voices one of the most attractive animated heroines ever put on film) and for the rivalry of a competitor. So he decides to make a new superhero to challenge him.The film is surprisingly witty and clever; it's filled with several laugh out loud moments and Ferrell gives another classic Will Ferrell performance. It has a slight 'INCREDIBLES' feel to it but never quite reaches those heights. It is better than the other super villain animated film this year though and is one of the best animated films of the year as well. Besides being funny it does have great social commentary: about the people we become because of the advantages and disadvantages were given at birth. It also has some pretty cool animation and action scenes. All in all it's a pretty fun and amusing animated film, better than most.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBqNUf10kuk"
35,Megamind,10,8 October 2012,Hilarious,"This movie was the funniest cartoon movie I had seen in years! Not only did it have a good plot, but the jokes (however, cheesy) were funny and made me laugh out loud. Younger children may not understand some of the adult humor (nothing inappropriate) throughout the movie, but they'll enjoy the characters and animation. I typically either love or hate Will Ferrell movies and this one I absolutely loved. It was Will Ferrell's humor at it's finest, and on a family friendly level. The plot was interesting because it wasn't a typical superhero movie, so the plot didn't follow the same pattern as most of the ""hero"" cartoons out there. It also sends a positive message. One of my favorite cartoons of all time."
36,Megamind,10,24 July 2011,Beautiful...Funny....Badass....all in one package!,"All i can say is wow.....a beautiful film relating to superman and a satire to current superhero movies.From the beginning i was so engrossed in this movie that i had not being able to,in animated movies,for a long long time.There are comedic scenes......there are emotional scenes...the battles are intense.....basically THIS FILM HAS GOT IT ALL..................and when you think you've seen it all.....there is an OH MY GOD moment at the end......although i will admit that the chick here looks a lot like the chick from MonstersVSaliens............still,I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO EVERYONE..........10/10....enjoy this heartwarming movie......cheers."
37,Megamind,10,11 February 2011,Better than Incredibles!!!!!,"I was shocked at how much i loved this film, and thoroughly pleased! The Trailers initially, i didn't fancy this one at all. And Megaminds design from the trailers i didn't initially like. The trailers kinda made this look like B grade fare, like say Hoodwinked or similar.BUT, WOW! As a fan of most of Pixar and Ice-Agees, I personally think Megamind is my new favourite of the lot! Ferrel was perfect, the designs and animation was stunning, and the storyline was interesting. I speak as an adult fan with no kids, this film had everything! It was witty, smart and well written/acted and spectacular.Toy story 3 was fantastic, but Megamind for me was more entertaining and funny. Incredibles was my number 1 pixar for a long time, and I wanted/want a sequel to that, but in Megamind, it bettered incredibles, and provided me with enough similar substance that it quenched my thirst as a sequel/spinnoff of sorts. But instead of following the Hero, we followed the villain. (As did Despicable me) But again, Megamind was much better.I only hope THIS gets a sequel. I'd actually rather a sequel to this now than incredibles.I love Pixar, but with Megamind/Kung Fu Panda and How to train Dragon, and cloudy meatballs, the other animation companies are seriously catching up!"
38,Megamind,7,18 December 2010,IMAX 3D Review: Megamind... will blow your mind!,"IMAX 3D: *** out of (****)Going into Dreamwork's latest concoction of laughs and slapstic, entitled ""Megamind"", I quite frankly didn't know what to expect. Typically, Will Ferrel has been a hit-or-miss actor who's mostly followed the latter, Tina Fey can pull one-liners out of her sleep and her delivery will still be humorous, and Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill get on my every nerve. Furthermore, while Dreamworks can pull a winner from out of their hat here-and-there (""Shrek"", ""How to train your dragon""), they're also notorious for pulling out cliché, by-the-numbers, family junk- food entertainment that reaches for the lowest common denominator on every level (""Monsters vs. Aliens""). There was simply no attractions that sparked my interest or reached above a thirty on Rotten Tomatoes at the time so I thought what the heck. It turns out, ""Megamind"" isn't so formulaic as I thought it to be. Now don't be fooled, this isn't any ""Shrek"" by any means (in fact, it's about 1/4 of its quality), but for what it was, it was pretty good.Since everyone is pretty safe with the whole ""superhero vs. supervillian"" concept, I'll save my breathe and time. How are the performances? Pretty much how you'd expect them to pan out. Tina Fey is great as always, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill still got on my nerves, and Will Ferrel was a hit this time. Everyone did what they had to do and did neither better nor worse than the viewer's average expectation. To top it off, while the story is not entirely inventive, the director throws the audience a few twists and turns. And since this is Dreamworks, even the trashiest of the trash are entertaining. However, the movie does start out a little slow. Oh and how can I forget the incredible action sequences? The action may be animated but it delivers. Explositions, fire, etc. This movie has it all.Now what about the little bumps in the road? Megamind, while labeled as a comedy, didn't make me laugh as nearly as much as I had hoped for. Furthermore, like I previously stated, the exposition is kind of slow. Moreover, while there are twists and turns, it can get predictable in some spots. To top it off the ""body switching"" segment got old very fast. Out of all the independent mind-provoking, in-depth character studies that don't see the light of day, how could a movie like ""Megamind"" slip under the rug you might ask? While this is very devastating to hear, a movie like ""Megamind"" could have been a lot worse. To go an extra mile, ""Megamind"" is actually good. It won't win any Oscars but it wins a place in my heart. Superb 3D, decent performances, and a good script makes me recommend this comedy-action 3D extravaganza. Recommended.IMAX 3-D MINI-REVIEW: Seeing ""Megamind"" in IMAX 3D was certainly no waste of money. The picture is as clear and detailed as if it were seen on a 1080p LCD HDTV, unlike standard digital 3D projections. The 3D was a notch better than non- 3D IMAX films and actually is as good, if not better, than viewed on a 3D film. The 3D has so much depth and occasional gimmicks to quench the audience's thirst. If you are seeing ""Megamind"", see it in IMAX 3D. Had I not seen it in this format, my score would probably be a ""6""."
39,Megamind,7,19 November 2012,Megamind - 3.5 AStars,"A city without a hero is indeed a bummer, but for the villain, it could be a catastrophe. Why formulate a nifty plot that will overtake the world if no one out there is good enough to challenge it? Where's the fun in building an enormous, vicious, dancing machine if no man of equal awesomeness will stand up to it? Megamind (Will Ferrell) knows this feeling all too well.When he was just a little infant, with skin as blue as an Avatar's and with a head as large as a papaya, Megamind (Brad Pitt) was sent to earth by his parents right before their planet was obliterated by a natural calamity. Just as we humans are about to complain again about the typhoons and global warming in our planet, we see theirs get sucked into a black hole.A neighboring planet had the same idea, and a second infant, soon to be famous as Metro Man, travels with small baby Megamind. The two aliens grow up to be rivals in Metro City, and battling each other has become an almost outlined routine. Villain kidnaps the girl. Hero shows up. Beats up villain. Sends him to jail. When villain inevitably escapes, the cycle is repeated. Each citizen seems to enjoy this, except for TV reporter Roxanne (Tina Fey), who is reasonably tired of the clichés.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/megamind-movie-review/"
40,Megamind,,26 December 2011,A real show,"Nice, strange and new. Ironic image of super heroes and interesting metamorphose of evil. Few slices of love story and an adorable character. Bleu,intelligent, childish and fragile, with an unhappy childhood, Megamind is perfect icon of our time. Behind him, rock-star Metroman, a kind of Elvis Presley or bored Charming Prince.Few fight scenes,a museum inauguration, a surprising victory and question of life sense.A Frankenstein creature. The error. In final, the clothes of Charming are perfect for new hero of town. Movie ad usum delphini, like every cartoon, tale about values and entertainment,Megamind is more. Game with rules and reflection of few ordinary crisis. Modelation of old definitions and replacement of marginal character. And birth of a very different hero far from any Superman or Batman but relative of their. It is not insignificant fact !"
41,Megamind,7,27 November 2011,Villain as hero,"The blue-skinned, bulbous-headed, shape-shifting, malapropism-spouting space-creature known as Megamind (Will Ferrell) prides himself on being the baddest bad guy around. His arch nemesis Metro Man (Brad Pitt), also a creature from beyond this world, is a squeaky-clean, universally beloved superhero who literally walks on water and keeps thwarting the plans Megamind has for ruling Metro City (which he mistakenly pronounces ""metrocity""). When Megamind, much to his own surprise actually, manages to do away with Metro Man in a contentious battle-to-the-death, he begins to realize that being a villain isn't all it's cracked up to be without a worthy hero to call an opponent. Thus, Megamind hatches a plot to clone another Metro Man figure out of some remnants of the dead hero's DNA. But Megamind gets more than he bargained for when his creation comes to life.Though ""Megamind, "" directed by Todd McGrath, has the distinction of being one of the only family-oriented animated films ever to feature a bad guy as its main character, the movie may be too cerebral and esoteric to completely enthrall children and too undisciplined and gimmicky to appeal all that much to adults. Still, the movie has a clean, sparkling look, filled with a whole host of futuristic devices in the foreground and stunning cityscapes in the background, and it moves fast enough to keep its audience focused on the screen for the duration. It also features the voice of Tina Fey as the Sweet Polly Purebred-type TV news reporter who is a constant bone of contention between Metro Man and Megamind - and Jonah Hill and Ben Stiller add their own vocal support in minor but key roles. And the script by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons contains an interesting subtext about the rewards and sacrifices that come with being both a hero and a villain, a subtext that brings an added dimension to the movie."
42,Megamind,,9 September 2011,a villain you can root for,"Megamind was a good movie about a mega villain. It's OK for adults and great for kids. Megamind comes to Earth seemingly destined to be a villain while counterpart Metro Man is destined to be a hero. The movie starts off showing their upbringings and about how Megamind was raised in jail. Next comes the battles between the two, but when Megamind finally wins, and seems to have destroyed Metro Man, he doesn't know what to do with his life. He decides he must make a new hero, but picks the wrong guy. Plus he is romancing reporter Roxanne, whom thanks he is just an average joe because he uses his watch to turn into someone else when around her.Megamind must fight new hero, Titan, but is he really a hero? Is Megamind more than a villain? FINAL VERDICT: An animation film with a good story and characters. I recommend it."
43,Megamind,10,29 May 2011,Never Thought I Would LOVE This Movie!,"I saw this on a whim at my school. I did not know anything about it and had no idea what to expect.WOW! I have not laughed this loud in theaters in the longest time. It is hard to be laugh out loud funny without being offensive or crude these days, but Megamind exceeds with flying colors.Will Ferrell and Brad Pitt have a fierce villain/hero rivalry that escalates quickly. The plot thickens with not your average anchorwoman Tina Fey tries to figure out what the two of them are all about. Add in Jonah Hill as the dorky camera man in love with Tina Fey and you have a hit.The animation is great, the music is wonderful, and the dialogue is the best. The dialogue is creative and hilarious. I hope to see more from the writers of this film!Despite any prejudices you hold against Dreamworks or Will Ferrell etc, you should really go see this movie. It made me laugh more than any other animated film and you will smile at the end of the movie. I promise, it earns the 10 out of 10 that I gave it."
44,Megamind,8,8 May 2011,"""Bad guys always LOSE!""","Superheroes typically win the fight and get the girl in the end, but what happens when a supervillain succeeds? We see maybe a little bit of that scenario with ""Despicable Me,"" but ""Megamind"" throws superpowers and heroism in the mix to more effectively lampoon off of the ""Superman"" mythos. As a result, we get a rather intriguing premise, gracious amounts of action and eye-candy, and quite a few amusing laughs. The comedy's nice and slappy, with plenty of funny lines. Will Ferrell's style of humor works well for the movie. It's quite fun overall, and I'd put it on the same level as ""Monsters vs Aliens."" The story's pretty unique; it borrows a little from other sources, but once it gets going it develops a brilliant tale of deception and dramatic irony. The middle of the movie drags maybe a little, and the film overall feels a little hectic as it jumps from one mad situation to another, and then tossing one or two bizarre twists. But it all works out sublimely in the end. It also helps that the characters receive decent treatment with some solid emotional depth.The film shows strong animation quality. Movements are smooth, textures rendering and lighting are great, and the overall designs are stylish. It's similar in style and quality to ""Monsters vs Aliens."" Voice-acting seems good; Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, Ben Stiller, are all decent. Music features a lot of rock songs, which seem a little arbitrary, but usually do fit their given scenes.4/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)"
45,Megamind,8,8 August 2016,A genuinely fun comedy movie,"Megamind is an animated comedy movie from 2010 which has become popular for it's genuine comedy and encaptivating protagonist.The story is about a blue,big-headed alien (megamind) who comes to Earth as infant and grew up in a prison.His rival,Metroman,too was sent to earth as an infant but he grew up in a rather luxurious home.This contrast in their upbringing quickly lit the fire for their rivalry and continued as they grew up. The movie tries to answer an important question which not many superhero movies delve into, 'What happens if the villain wins?'.When metroman dies , you can clearly see the loneliness inside megamind and would almost feel a little bad for him. His plan to create a new hero for him to fight was laughably ingenious. The strongest aspect of the movie were clearly the characters. Megamind is one of the funniest protagonists in animated movies who can be silly and evil at the same time while still making you laugh.Tighten was an unexpected villain given the way he was introduced but truly came off as evil.Roxanne and Metroman were great too.The story itself was linear and predictable at points but interesting enough to keep the audience occupied and the music was just amazing with songs like 'crazy train' and 'highway to hell' perfectly complimenting Megamind's nature.The only way one would be disappointed from this movie is if you expect too many new things in the plot.It blatantly takes up concepts from some famous superhero movies but it doesn't even try to hide that it has.Overall,it was just a fun ride you can enjoy with family and friends."
46,Megamind,8,25 December 2013,The unlikely hero.,"This is another film that I didn't think I would like.I don't know how I got the vibe,but it was just there.Finally,after hearing some good things about it elsewhere,I decided to give it a try.The results were good.The idea was a good one,and it was carried forward and presented very well.A stereotypical ""villain"",after ""killing"" his super hero rival,finds himself in a rut,so he creates a new super hero to keep him busy.Things go awry and the subsequent twists and turns in the story result in our villain friend becoming an unlikely hero.I think that's pretty cool,so I will more than likely have it on my DVD shelf in the near future."
47,Megamind,9,14 October 2013,Twists the idea of what is good and what is evil,"I have previously mentioned that the one thing that first grabs my attention to a film is the trailer, and with Megamind, the trailer did not catch me. When it was said that this movie was made by the makers of Shrek, I didn't think they could actually out do Shrek, that is until I watched it at my friend's house, and I must say that I am really glad that the trailer gave very little away, because as it turns out, Megamind rocks.The movie starts off with Megamind and his nemesis Metroman as babies and being sent off from their home planets, which is destroyed by a black hole. They then land on earth, Metroman in a wealthy household, and Megamind in the local prison. Metroman is gifted with superhuman powers, while Megamind has his fish, and superhuman intelligence. As such they fight, and sometimes Megamind loses, and at other times he almost wins, but doesn't.I really do not want to give too much of this film away, except that it explores the idea of bad turning good and good turning bad. It also suggests that sometimes our destiny is the product of the environment. Metroman is gifted with a wealthy upbringing and superhuman powers, and thus becomes good, while Megamind is trapped in gaol, is scorned by his peers, and thus he turns bad. However, good is not always good, and the pressure of being a hero can be sometimes quite overwhelming, while though one may be bad, it does not necessarily mean that we are not capable of redemption (and this is something that I can attest to).Oh, and I also found this movie to be very funny, though I am still loathe to say that it outdid Shrek."
48,Megamind,7,14 December 2011,Megamind (2010),"I'm the kind of guy that would love to see this idea pulled off seriously. The villain conquering the hero is an interesting one, and really has the villain questioning their role in life. Batman The Animated Series did this years ago, as The Joker became depressed at the (apparent) death of Batman. Dreamworks cranks out this idea, but ruined it in the trailers. Basically, it wasn't as dark as I had hoped. Luckily, I did find it very funny. Especially the relationship between Minion and Megamind. It gradually became more predictable, but also a lot of fun. Megamind is never truly villainous enough. He seems to be more of a joke villain than an evil genius. It will entertain, but might not have a huge effect in the future. If you like your animation simple and reliable, this is it. Though, I'll never understand why Dreamworks have to end their films on cringeworthy dance numbers."
49,Megamind,7,21 November 2011,"Much better than suspected, I had low expectations","Megamind is one of those movies where the trailers really did the movie no justice at all. The movie is funny, but not extremely funny. There are a couple of scenes which seem borrowed from other movies, but that is one of my major gripes and that's it.The movie has a wonderful visual style and surprisingly good effects. The animation is wonderful and the explosions are very good. The characters are actually pretty interesting and Tina Fey at first sounded kind of a bad choice though she actually did a good job. Megamind is an interesting character who can never really decide if he is a good guy or a bad guy. I will say there are a few scenes that are very similar to Despicable Me, but I'm pretty sure this movie had been in development a lot longer seeing as how much work was put into the animation.The final showdown was actually entertaining and Tighten (titan) was fairly dark in my opinion. Megamind is a villain who loves to do bad and then losing so that he can do bad again. Tighten on the other hand is basically rage, selfishness and real evil. Overall a very entertaining movie, one small gripe is that some of the scenes seem very blank and flat, but I think they may have done that on purpose for visual appearance."
50,Megamind,,19 November 2011,An animation as it should be!,"An excellent animation movie that should be leader for following projects...Many times we see silly animated movies only to be seen by 5-years old kids...But,some times a miracle happens and we get a brilliant animation,like Megamind,that is enjoyable for all ages... I must admit that was maybe the first animated movie that surprised me with its ending...Why? When Megamind transforms into Metroman(near the end of the movie-at the final battle) i thought 'Metroman returned,he will win the bad guy,he will take the girl and he will continue to fight Megamind forever more'...Notice that this way Megamind would get at he wanted,too(his arch-enemy and their battles back)...They could have done that and everything would be alright with the world...But they decided to turn Megamind into a good guy(for the first time in his life) and they gave him the girl...In all the other animated movie you pretty much know the (happy)end before you even see the movie,but Megamind's ending was something i did not expect and that fact tells much for the whole movie...Great job,great movie!!"
51,Megamind,,20 August 2011,"Predictable, but still unique","An interesting twist on the whole super hero movie universe. It starts out introducing two very different people, but tells it in the perspective of the bad guy's life and view. In fact, most of the movie is based on the bad guy's life and his view of how things go. He thinks that he was born to be evil so he just tries his best, although most of his plans usually fail.There are other characters, including a new reporter, who soon gains a relationship/friendship with this evil person. Plus, he has managed to kill the good guy finally, and soon realizes that he has no purpose without a good guy. But soon he realizes that the good guy is in fact still alive... however he has become a lazy cough potato who can play the guitar.The bad guy decides to turn good when his own creation, a 'good guy' turns bad. This twist ends up making the bad guy get the girl in the end. It's a very interesting movie, with a lot of twists and turns. One moment you're siding with one person, the next moment you switch sides. It's an interest movie with very interesting plot changes.I rate this 8/10 because of a few swear words and such. Plus it didn't make me cry. But I'll rate this that high because it was a fairly unique movie despite being a super hero movie."
52,Megamind,9,5 December 2010,"""Megamind"" has Mega Laughs and Heart","DreamWorks' animated ""Megamind"" benefits ironically from Will Ferrell's hysterical voice rendering. Ferrell voices the slender bulbous headed blue complexioned super-villain Megamind. His usual goofy oafish persona is not a glaring distraction as the diminutive misunderstood leather clad evil genius. Ferrell is uncharacteristically restrained, and self aware as Megamind. At a story arc, his Megamind confesses, ""Bad guys don't save the day, and they don't get the girl"" In the plot twist of the original story by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simmons, the super-villain must transform into the superhero. This is no surprise. What is surprising? ""Megamind"" does so hilariously and poignantly.Director Tom McGrath seamlessly and simultaneously parodies the superhero genre and embraces it. Beleaguered Megamind apparently destroys his arch nemesis Metro Man (comically pompous Brad Pitt), anointed defender of Metro City. No one is more shocked than Megamind himself. Equally bewildered is intrepid reporter Roxanne Ritchie (spunky and composed Tina Fey): How could Metro Man die? Even if you haven't seen the movie trailer, you can kind of figure this one out. Anyway, Megamind institutes his evil reign of Metro City. However, he soon discovers there is little joy in evil, all alone. He realizes that eternal paradox: There is no evil, without good. Megamind was the Yin to Metro Man's Yangthe universal balance. Schoolcraft and Simmons eloquently pull a ""Kung Fu Panda"".Determined to restore the fun in evil, Megamind and his sidekick Minion (hysterically obtuse David Cross) embark to create a new hero. Leveraging Metro Man's DNA residue, the two select Hal (brilliantly geeky Jonah Hill) as their candidate. Hal creepily grips a torch for Roxanne. In horrendous miscalculation despite Megamind's Brando homage tutelage, Hal emerges as Titan-- ultimate super-villain. Unintentionally, Megamind places Roxanne in jeopardy. Meanwhile Megamind finds himself appreciating Roxanne. So Megamind must cowboy up: Reclaim his innate greatness, and become the hero he is destined to be. Flashback to the infant his parents secured in his spaceship bound for earth from their dying planet. With his father's words obscured Megamind screams, ""Destined for what? I didn't catch that last part!""The 3D in ""Megamind"" is spectacular. 3D envisioning in animated features seem to fair best. The 3D is not really integral to the story. The effect of Metro City is a monolithic and futuristic version of Los Angeles. That context does work. What also work are narrative backdrops for both Megamind and Metro Man. Both share similar origins: Advanced alien parents of separate dying worlds send their sons to Earth as its saviors. Chaos literally collides as the baby, who becomes Metro Man, lands in the wealthy estate of Lord and Lady Scott. While the baby, who becomes Megamind, lands in a State Prison, and raised by its inmates. Their paths cross again as toddlers in a School for the Gifted. Megamind playing to his strong suit makes the life altering choice to be evil. Amazingly, we catch up with Megamind serving 8 consecutive life sentences, but from all accounts he has not harmed anyone. His sole punishment seems consequence of being the big loser in his battles with Metro Man.McGrath effectively enrolls Megamind's underdog empathy. His is a solitary and misrepresented existenceas in a failure to be. So when he accidentally impersonates gentle and kind Metro Man Museum curator Bernard (charming and clumsy Ben Stiller) and befriends the beautiful Roxanne (Fey), we pull for him. Megamind is more himself as Bernard, than his evil genius self. Roxanne is genuinely falling for Bernard as well. Here Ferrell displays a deceptive subtle charm. Fey is funny and vulnerable as the unflappable independent woman relinquishing her guard. Brad Pitt is hysterical in self effacing parody as Metro Man. The narrative twist involving his Metro Man completes the movie with his aloof and touching turn. ""Megamind"" is predictable only in structure; otherwise it is abundant with surprise. ""Megamind"" has big laughs and a big heart."
53,Megamind,8,3 November 2010,Hang on tight and be prepared for mega fun!,"We believe that God is fair  what one lacks in a certain department is probably made up in another. We say this because while we are not the best looking people, we choose to believe that we are blessed with the gift of writing, hence the reviews you are reading on this humble website. And that is why we feel for comedians like Will Ferrell. He is not the most dashing leading man around, but he is one hell of a funny man.This latest feature from DreamWorks Animation is a fine testament to that: The title character's over swollen skull and blue skin makes him one of the most disturbingly ugly animated characters of all time, but like the actor who voices him, he is one hell of a funny creature.We feel for you, Mr. Ferrell, we truly do.When we first meet Megamind, he is falling to his death. A voice-over then brings us back to the day he is born, right up to the predicament he is facing at the moment. You see, Megamind has been trying very hard over the years to conquer Metro City. You name the method, he has tried it. He fails every time because of the existence of Metro Man, a caped superhero who seems too perfect to be true. In an unexpected turn of events, Megamind defeats and kills Metro Man. To balance the equation of good versus evil, Megamind creates a new superhero Titan, who eventually becomes a super villain. Throw in a love interest in the form of a pesky news reporter Roxanne Ritchi, and you get 96 minutes of wacky and exhilarating fun.Trust the filmmakers to gather a brilliant cast of voice actors for this production. Ferrell is a certified fast talker who provides most of the movie's best lines. The Saturday Night Live alum puts his talents of impersonations and spoofing a range of characters to good use here. Listen out for the fast talking Megamind as he delivers line after line of amusingly entertaining dialogue. Tina Fey is adorably humorous as Roxanne Ritchi the news anchor who refuses to be the damsel in distress, David Cross is a hoot as Megamind's under-appreciated piranha Minion, while Jonah Hill's goofiness comes through nicely as the menacing Titan. Rounding up the ensemble is Brad Pitt as Mr Goodie Two Shoes Metro Man. After voicing Sinbad in the studio's Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas some seven years ago, the hunky leading man personifies his usual arresting on screen presence with a duly fun performance.The next thing audiences would ask is: Is this worth the 3D ticket price? It is with great pleasure we tell you that it's a positive yes. Animations have always been a more welcoming medium for studios to milk the cash cow that is 3D technology. But those which truly capture the magic of the additional dimension are few and far between. Director Tom McGrath has managed to effectively feature this somewhat overused technique with good eye popping effect. Watch out as Megamind's Brain Bots fly towards you, clap your hands in glee as Metro Man whizzes at the screen, and gape in awe as balls of fire explode after one another, no thanks to Titan's newfound super power.These enthralling sensational moments would not be what they are without a witty and dynamite script. You'd be entertained every other minute by the sharp writing, and kept engaged by the dynamic plot development. While the young ones are wowed by the dazzling animation, the older audiences will be having fun with the fresh and crisp jokes.As the movie comes to an end, we almost forgot how hideous Megamind is. The guy has gotten a special place in our hearts.www.moviexclusive.com"
54,Megamind,4,6 January 2013,Megamoot,"What makes a hero? Upbringing, genetics or some cosmic mix of fate? As two pods with infants near Earth they collide. One carrying Megamind (Will Ferrell) ends up in a prison facility, where he is consequently raised by the inmates and their perverse sense of right and wrong. The other one, carrying Metro Man (Brad Pitt), lands where Megamind was destined to be before the ill-fated collision: straight into luxury and the loving care of a high-class family. Thus their fates seem to be set from the start with the privileged and indestructible Metro Man destined to be a hero, while Megamind always pigeonholed as the offender, the bad guy, the villain. During another of their countless confrontations, Megamind seemingly destined for an n-teenth defeat, the inexplicable happens, as Metro Man suddenly meets his demise. Thus Megamind has managed the ultimate victory and is left to control Mega City unchallenged. But no challenge, means no fun, so Megamind soon ventures to create himself a new super-foe (while simultaneously falling in love with journalist Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey))...The animation genre has a knack for extremely well-written narratives, possibly due to the immense budgets for creativity, which are necessary for their development. ""Megamind"" feels well-polished as a nicely wrought satire on the superhero genre with some hearty commentary on the human nature (although lets not get overly philosophical on the impact the movie aims to make). Nonetheless ""Megamind"" falls foul to high expectations of the genre, lacking a strong backbone of likable characters, instead featuring an extremely irritating and plain unfunny Jonah Hill as Tighten as the ultimate foe. Megamind, Metro Man and Roxanne each have limited appeal with none of the secondary cast captivating interest. Limitedly humorous ""Megamind"" fails to be truly entice, and as it is above all entertainment, deserves low grades in this regard. Despite some admirable underlying themes, which should be applauded by parents for their significance, the frontal narrative lacks enough inspirational impact to truly linger on the mind."
55,Megamind,8,9 December 2010,Spectacular fun,"Megamind is one of those movies which occupies the uncomfortable position of second out of the box. In this case Despicable Me was the first CGI feature about a lovable, and ultimately redeemable villain and, when the first one is good (as Despicable Me was), the second effort often suffers criticism by comparison.Personally, I liked Megamind more, for two reasons.One, it doesn't have the air of sentimentality which pervaded Despicable Me. And, two, it has some terrific super-hero stuff, and I'm a sucker for my super-heroing. In a beautifully realised city, some serious mayhem is wreaked, with heat vision being particularly well portrayed.Will Ferrell's Megamind starts off sounding like a cross between Roddie McDowell and the Chief Blue Meanie before finding his own voice. Tina Fay's Roxanne is so closely modelled on Lois Lane that I'm surprised DC haven't sued. Brad Pitt's Metro Man is suitably heroic (and unaware of how crass he's being) and Jonah Hill does good voice work on Titan/Tighten, albeit the character looks disconcertingly like Seth Rogen.This movie was good fun, and the 3D worked very well. Oh, and there are lots of little touches for old school super-hero comic fans to watch out for."
56,Megamind,8,19 November 2017,"Very good, and surprisingly so","Megamind, a super-intelligent alien villain, at long last destroys his nemesis, the super-hero Metro Man. Instead of being satisfied, he feels empty, so creates a new super-hero. Unfortunately the super-hero turns out to be a super-villain, and Megamind has to assume the role of super-hero in order to stop him.Very good, and surprisingly so. I thought this was going to be another comic-book-hero/animated kids movie. Kids will certainly enjoy it, but so will adults. Good plot, snappy dialogue, very funny, unrelenting pace. Action sequences are a prop, not the main idea, which is always good, and the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. Heaps of fun.Great casting and performances - voices are spot-on."
57,Megamind,8,30 October 2017,This Film Deserves More Attention!,"Okay, I'm not going to act like this is the best Dreamworks movie ever made. I believe that title goes to one of the How To Train Your Dragon films. But no one really seems to remember this movie, and that's a shame. On the surface, Megamind looks like a spoof of the ""superhero genre."" But when you actually watch the film, it actually has some pretty well done character development and asks some interesting questions. It is also full of twists and turns (which I won't spoil here). The best part of this movie, by far, is Will Ferrell's performance as Megamind. Not only is he (and the animation department) able to produce some really funny moments, but when things get serious, Ferrell actually pulls of those more dramatic scenes as well. The rest of the cast are great as well, particularly David Cross and Brad Pitt. The movie also has a very cinematic feel to it, almost like it was meant to be a live action film at first, but they then decided to animate it. This especially shows during the action scenes. All in all, I think this is a very solid film that deserves more recognition. In time, who knows? Fingers crossed that we'll get a sequel!"
58,Megamind,,21 May 2017,The Perfect Example of Why You Do Not Judge a Book by its Cover ...,"I know I am many years late in writing this, but I LOVE this movie !!!I collect all movies staring the FratPack ... and had this movie not stared any of them I would probably, honestly not have thought to watch it, I wont lie I did not think it was going to be a good one, good guy yayee bad guy yayee and the lady of course ... a typical movie. But I Love that I was proved wrong - Megamind is just absolutely great - Will Ferrell as Megamind, there could honestly have been no- one better for this role. Jonah Hill Fantabulous, Titan is just a total looney but this movie teaches us to care and love even those who who might not be who you normally like.I could honestly go on forever - this not just a must watch movie, this is a must own !!!Great for for the whole family and entertaining from start to finish -this is a movie for you if you just need a good laugh :)"
59,Megamind,7,7 May 2017,A Fun Surprise,"The supervillain Megamind finally defeats his nemesis, the superhero Metro Man. But without a hero, he loses all purpose and must find new meaning to his life.Of the animated films in the last ten years, ""Megamind"" does not seem to get a lot of love. Which is a real shame. Because although it may be basically a Superman spoof, it is a very clever and very funny spoof. And with Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, it's hard to beat. (Jonah Hill could have been replaced.) Is it too late for a sequel? Because there really ought to be one, even if it seems that ""Despicable Me"" has the animated villain market covered."
60,Megamind,7,26 April 2017,"A good movie, even if it's not brilliant.","This film follows the trend, of the ""good villains"" in animated films, more and more evident since ""Despicable Me"". In fact, both films are from the same year and its difficult not to make comparisons, but I will resist this temptation. The core of this film is a hero vs. villain fight, where Megamind, the villain, manages to finally win, which puts in question the purpose of his life forward, without a good guy who fight against him. Its clearly thought out for teenagers and young adults and action is a fundamental part of the fun, along with good humor. Drawings and animations were really well made, the plot is good and pace is perfect, with no dead moments or annoyingly boring situations. But it lacks that spark of brilliance that you see in films that last forever and become classics. This spark, this film does not have, not being remarkable or memorable. It's a good movie, no doubt, but it's within the standards that studios have used us to. Entertainment and laughter are guaranteed, and that's reason enough to make it worth it."
61,Megamind,10,26 April 2017,mega fun,"WHY WAS I ATTRACTED TO THIS MOVIE? 1.the director of this movie, TOM MCGRATH is also the director of Madagascar, one of the best animation comedy so. 2.i love animation comedies. 3.i love ""mind"" movies.

62,Megamind,10,7 February 2017,I Love This Movie!,"A super hero movie with a ""You've Got Mail"" type love story. It is both heart warming and hilarious. The cast is great. The voice acting is great. The animation is great. The story is great. The music is great. Well, you get the picture. Another plus is the movie is not laced with political messages like Zootopia. That movie was ruined for me by annoying politics. Megamind has broad appeal and has something for almost everyone. I will confess that I am inclined to like this type of movie, but even after deducting points for bias, this movie would get a high score. I really wish they had done a sequel. The worst thing I can say about this movie is that it was over too quickly."
63,Megamind,8,25 January 2017,A villain needs a hero,"One day two alien babies were sent to Earth; one landed in a wealthy household, developed superpowers and grew up to be the superhero Metro Man; the other landed in prison, developed a powerful mind and grew up to become the supervillain Megamind this film follows the latter. The two are rivals; Megamind plots his schemes against Metro City and Metro Man thwarts them and sends him to prison. Then one day Megamind kidnaps reporter Roxanne Ritchie, who everybody believes is Metro Man's girlfriend, and waits for him to try to rescue her. He manages to captures Metro Man and fires his death ray at him knowing he will escape only he doesn't. While using a disguise he rescues Roxanne and the two grow close; until she realises who he is. He soon realises that without a hero to fight against his life has no meaning. To solve this problem he sets about creating another hero with Metro Man's powers; unfortunately the wrong man gets the powers and Metro City ends up with a much more unpleasant villain: Titan. With a new villain in town Megamind will have to change; he will have to become a hero then maybe he will win and even get the girl.This movie turned out to be a lot of fun; there are so many films centred on the superhero so it made a refreshing change have one that followed the villain. The early scenes played with the genre clichés in an enjoyable way that led up to the genuinely surprising 'death' of Metro Man. It later emerges that he isn't dead but not for quite a while. The main characters were fun; Megamind is suitably dastardly without actually being malicious; Metro Man is sickeningly perfect and Roxanne is feisty and avoids many of the character traits we would expect; notably her not being romantically interested in Metro Man. Titan is a decent enough bad guy; he is clearly not very bright and emotionally backward. The character designs are good, the animation is of a high standard and the voice cast do a fine job of bringing them to life. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody looking for an animation that can be enjoyed by all ages."
64,Megamind,8,8 January 2017,"""You know I'm bad, I'm bad come on, you know,And the whole world has to,Answer right now.""","When originally hearing about this film a few years ago,I for somehow mixed up for being part of the Despicable Me series! Finding Turbo and Mr. Peabody & Sherman to be delightful ""one-offs"" from Dream Works that were shown on TV during Christmas,I decided to correct my mix up,and delve into the mind of Megamind.The plot:Being the only baddie in the city,Megamind passes the day in fights with local superhero Metro Man.Finding Metro man to get bored of the routine,Megamind kidnaps Metro's girlfriend Roxanne Ritchie for the 5th time,and sets a new trap. Preparing for Metro to arrest him once again,Megamind and the city are left in chaos,when Megamind's latest trap appears to have finally killed Metro off! Expecting to be happy,Megamind starts getting depressed over there being no superheroes to fight with,which pushes Megamind to put his mind on creating a new superhero.View on the film:Bringing Ben Stiller and Guillermo del Toro in to give the title a final gloss in the last month of production, director Tom McGrath looks into a mind of endless energy,with the attention to detail shown in the wide street shots leading to the action scenes having a crunch that is a match for any live action Comic-Book flick. Making Megamind rather refined, McGrath pulls at the vibrant,pulp coloured roots of Comic-books,flying from Megamind having a deep blue, paranormal round his cape,to the stainless steel whites reflecting the funny ""perfection"" image of Metro.Landing just before Comic-book movies took over the Summer season,the screenplay by Brent Simons & Alan Schoolcraft dives between a hilarious spoof,and a genuinely exciting anti- superhero tale in its own right. Taking sweet shots at Megamind getting what every baddie wants in a blockbuster flick,the writers hilariously dissect superhero and villains mythologies by leaving Megamind at a complete loss over what to do over finally succeeding. Soaring to life with sharp animation that give the characters a fresh appearance,the writers brilliantly match the high-flying jokes with a sweet, lonely heart being revealed behind the boo-hiss image of Megamind,as a mega light is turned on in Megamind's mind."
65,Megamind,5,17 November 2016,Okay movie; definitely for youngsters and not recommended for more mature audiences,Overall: It's an OK movie but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have children as it is not for more mature audiences.Good: It was entertaining and I love that it is a spoof of Superman. The voice acting and animation is superb. All the characters are archetypes but that fits and works well in the 'spoof' part of the movie. I laughed a few times but it was definitely aimed at younger audiences. The music was just plain and simply awesome. The are some inside jokes for older audiences and those with a keen eye but these are too infrequent.Bad: I didn't like the villain as he was just too predictable and uninteresting. Obviously it was aimed at younger audiences so most laughs will come from that age group and it meant I wasn't laughing as much as I hoped. The story was pretty mediocre but it is for kids so I can let it slide.Best Part: The start of the final confrontation between Megamind and Titan.MVP: Will Ferrell as Megamind5/10
66,Megamind,6,28 April 2016,Fun but flawed,"Good and quite funny, but didn't come close to reaching full potential. Repeated gags and imagery, flat characters, an overused Soundtrack, and the animation, while not bad in any way, had nothing else to offer, aside from Megamind's entrance into the Final Battle. It is a nice ensemble cast, full of likable actors (and AN actress), but again, not much more to offer other than that. None of them seemed to really delve into their characters. But that's the fault of the script. It takes short-cuts for comedic effect, at the expense of real characterization. But, I mean, it's for children, so it's a perfectly fine movie.Although it kind of seems weird to me, that they hugged instead of kissed in the end. I mean, come on. It's a Happy Ending. Let them kiss, for crying out loud. No child will be traumatized by the sight of that. Kids are not stupid."
67,Megamind,7,2 June 2011,Rise of the Villains?,"Let's be honest- we all love a good villain. Not one of us can say there hasn't been a movie where we have like the villain more than the hero. A classic example would be the Disney animated movie cartoon. Which of us hasn't fast forward through ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" to get to ""Be Prepared"" or skipped ""Part of Your World"" in order to see ""Poor Unfortunate Souls""? Villains just always seem to put on a great show that we, as the audience, love to watch. In recent children's movies, directors have taken an advantage of this love. Movies in which the villain is the main character have begun to surface. I loved this idea when I first heard it mentioned, but my excitement was ruined with my viewing of Despicable Me. This movie was alright, and there were some pretty funny scenes, but overall the movie was cliché and mediocre. I watched Megamind with hesitancy, wondering what I would get, but to my pleasant surprise I really enjoyed this movie. The movie had a great plot and perfect voice actors to match the characters. The story was basic yet enjoyable, a perfect balance found in successful family films. All in all, this movie has me yearning for more movies with the villain in the forefront."
68,Megamind,8,30 May 2011,What if Luthor defeated Superman?,"Watch this movie to know what happens ;) This movie has obvious references to superman movies.. and it was really interesting to see the roles reversed .. it is a sweet story of a loser whom destiny chooses to be a villain but he finds his true calling elsewhere The heroine is obviously based on Louis Lane.. but she is not romantically attracted to Metro man of Metropolis oops .. metro city ... the fish is a cool character and provides quite a few laughs specially his antics at the end.. the voice acting is superb.. as should be as the cast includes the likes of Brad Pitt Will Ferrel, Jonah Hill ... the actual villain was quite irritating, which he was supposed to be, but he reminded me tremendously like Shia LaBeouf ... his expressions and other things reminded me of that actor... definitely worth a watch... then once more"
69,Megamind,,13 April 2011,Megamind,"Megamind is about a villainous blue alien that wants to bust a nut on a white female. Pretty normal story except for the alien part. It turns out he doesn't just want to bust a nut on her but he actually like likes her. Not sure if it's love, so I'm not about to tell the reader it's love and then you think I'm a liar for the rest of my synopsis. Anyways the blue alien creates a monster ( a fat Caucasian), that turns into a real big problem. The blue alien quits ""the game"" only to find out that the monster is going to kill the woman he like likes. The blue alien wins an epic showdown with the help of his alien friends only to find out people like him for saving the city. Good work alien now go bust a nut on that white girl."
70,Megamind,7,11 April 2011,"Noisy, wild, hyperactive, crazy...  pretty good!","Noisy, wild, hyperactive, crazy... depending on how you interpret those words will likely determine how much you like this movie. The comparisons to ""Despicable Me"" (which came out a few months earlier) are inevitable, as is those who will line up behind one or the other as better. Personally I go with Despicable Me for its extra heart, wittier dialogue and more laughs.One thing that Megamind has in abundance is dazzling animation on a grand scale. The destruction is phenomenal in some scenes, and the battle between Megamind's Monster Machine and his Monstrous Creation (Titan) has some of the hardest hits I've ever scene in any film. I also liked the insights into the superhero genre and seeing the caricature hero & villain both evolve in the course of the movie.It did start to get predictable in the last half, to the point where I started guessing lines of dialogue (much to the amazement of my boys) and correctly foresaw plot twists. Also, many scenes in the movie are backed-up by raucous 80's & 90's metal, and there's a lot of noise and high-intensity action throughout the film. While I do like this stuff, it has to be balanced for the right impact and here it just felt like an assault of the senses. Last of all, there is a lot of exposition, (starting from the opening intro) and I think it would have been a better film to follow the old adage, ""Show, don't tell"".Overall, it was enjoyable and entertaining. Some good laughs, some hard actions, great special effects... worth watching. But Ohlo, not for small children!"
71,Megamind,7,14 March 2011,Megamind is a fun and entertaining film that doesn't try to feel or look real,"¨All men must choose between two paths: Good is the path of honor, friends, and family. Evil, well, it's just cooler.¨Megamind is a very fun animated film that doesn't have to be taken seriously like other recent animated movies. It doesn't try to look or feel real, it knows what it is: a cartoon. Megamind will be fun for both children and adults alike (unlike recent animated films-like Rango- that try too hard to target adults and forget that kids want to have a fun time as well). This isn't a movie that has deep meaning to it, or a strong message, or a lot of heart, but it does entertain audiences thanks to the strong voice acting and funny one-liners. The characters are rather simple and one dimensional, but fun to hang around with. Director Tom McGrath has already had success with these animated films as he directed both Madagascar films, and just like those two movies, Megamind should be enjoyed for what it is: an animated picture that is fun for the entire family. I thought that the writers, Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons, did a decent job with the script making it really funny at times thanks to some witty one-liners. With Will Ferrell and Tina Fey you really don't know how much was scripted and how much was really improvised, but the final result is what matters, and the movie was able to entertain all audiences. This isn't an original or memorable film, but it does manage to entertain and I really had a fun time with the movie.While Megamind (Will Ferrell) is going through a near death experience he tells us the story of his life from the very beginning. The blue creature with a giant head was born in another planet. This planet was being destroyed when his parents decided to send him to Earth as a baby in order to save his life. Megamind is travelling through the galaxy along with his talking fish named Minion (David Cross), who lives inside some sort of robotic suit. But Megamind is not the only alien headed for Earth. Another baby is headed this way with a normal human appearance; his name is Metro Man (Brad Pitt). Somehow destiny plays a joke on Megamind who ends up being raised by prisoners from a local jail, while Metro Man is raised by a rich family. Both kids grow up and become nemesis: Metro Man turns into the hero of Metro City, while Megamind finds his calling in life as a villain because it is the only thing he seems to be good at (although he doesn't do a very good job at it because Metro Man is always defeating him and sending him to jail). The people love Metro Man and declare him a local hero, while Megamind unsuccessfully tries to destroy him by being the Super-Villain. Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey) is the local News Reporter who is covering the inauguration of the Metro Man Museum when she is kidnapped for the hundredth time by Megamind. Against everyone's unbelief, including Megamind's, he destroys Metro Man and is successful for the first time in his life. But without an enemy, Megamind gets bored and loses his purpose in life so he decides to create another hero using Metro Man's DNA. This hero happens to be Titan (Hal), who actually turns into a villain himself instead of saving the city, so now Megamind will be forced to become the hero.The plot has several similarities to many superhero stories, and we might be reminded of other similar animated films such as The Incredibles, but Megamind still works as an entertaining animated film because it has an excellent voice acting cast. This film will have you entertained for 95 minutes and at the end you will leave the movie with a smile in your face. It doesn't try to be something that it isn't and that is why it is so fun. You don't have to remind yourself that you are watching a cartoon like in other movies that try to fool you by making these animated films look real and authentic. You can just sit down and enjoy Megamind for what it is, a fun and simplistic cartoon. Another plus is the soundtrack which just adds to the overall feeling and mood of light fun the film tries to convey. The vocal wit makes up for the lack of originality the movie has. This film should be taken lightly, but it does have a pretty positive message for those who like searching for meaning in movies: it reminds us that heroes are made and not born. We don't have to let our past and our surroundings shape our lives, we can change the course of our destiny and improve our past actions. It's not an original or strong meaningful message, but it reminds us that it's never too late to find our purpose in life in a very light, fun, and entertaining way.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
72,Megamind,10,12 March 2011,A great animated flick,"The trailers for this movie made it look pretty weak. I watched it in the theater only because there was nothing left, and I had to be convinced to go because the trailers had given me a pretty bad image of the film. But was I pleasantly surprised! The story is a simple and unique take on the tired superhero movies: what if the villain won for once? The film begins when Megamind (the villain) defeats his arch nemesis Metroman (the hero). Rather than being happy, Megamind realizes suddenly that his life has lost meaning as a result, and he begins to search for ways to regain his happiness. Through that journey he unexpectedly discovers himself, without having set out to find himself to being with. The story expresses the often forgotten fact in our society (and rarely portrayed in films) that destiny is nothing but a word for the lives that we build for ourselves. We determine our futures, our outcomes, there is no path appointed before us. Throughout the film Megamind strongly believes in this concept of ""destiny"" and only when he relaxes this belief and realizes that ""being bad"" was not his fate, but the one which society and his environment had expected of him, does he find real happiness in life.It's a delightful story. The jokes are fun. The characters are lovable. Another thing that stands out in Megamind is the animation. This is the film that has really won me over to computer animation. The animation is spectacular. The emotions expressed on the characters' faces is so enthralling. The action scenes are addicting. I really liked Megamind. I have heard mixed word of mouth reviews, but I for one loved it. It was not over the top. It was not phenomenal. It was not larger than life and it was not the cheap tear jerker that it so many animated films of today try and be. But in place of those things I believe was honesty, and a deeper than normal message told in a fun and exciting way. The fact that this film was just average, that it was not over the top, made it all the more better and fitting :D 10/10"
73,Megamind,9,8 March 2011,Fun stab at the Genre,"This movie gets about as close to plagiarizing characters as you can get.So the story is about a supervillian with a relationship with a hero that looks entirely too much like Superman and Lex Luthor. After the villain causes the hero's (apparent) demise, he starts up a relationship with the Lois Lane like love interest of the hero using a holographic projection, and realizes what he really needs is a hero to challenge him.Unfortunately, he picks the entire wrong guy, a nerdy cameraman with issues of his own.What sells this movie are the characterizations by the voice actors combined with the fun animation, especially Will Ferrel as ""MegaMind"" and Tina Fey as Roxanne. (Who I think is also the name of the love interest in ""Cyrano""? Coincidence? I think not.) Brad Pitt is fun as the Hero in the few ""cameo"" scenes he has."
74,Megamind,7,2 March 2011,Mega entertainer,"Hollywood doesn't seems to be running out of creative ideas very soon. 'Megamind' is a good example.Good animations always has its place. And with several big time animation studios doing their best to get to the sweet top spot we seems to be treated with superior stories, characters and overall superior animation quality year after year. And while the live action movies take up on comic book super heroes, 'Megamind' goes on creating super heroes and villains of its own and deliver it with a punch full of super power.Megamind (Voice by Will Farrell) is a super villain. After he left his dying planet at infant age and hits the planet earth his big blue head realized only one big reality. That is that no matter how good he tries to be good world does not except that. So he turn villain and become 'the' pro at that. But his eternal pain is Metro Man ( Voice by Brad Pitt) who is a super hero who shares the same fate as Megamind from a distant dead planet. Well he can fly but Megamind can't. One fine day after years of battling each other Megamind succeeds in destroying Metro Man. And then he realizes that the world is not the same place any more with his arch enemy is gone and no one to battle with. So Megamind sets to create a Super hero of his own to battle with but finds that he has made a grave mistake doing so.'Megamind' is fast phased. The first few minutes of the movie quickly creates a strong base to the rest of the plot and its solidly done. And the plot stands tall. Creative, amusing and yet emotional where it should be. And the very kick ass animation does its part so well some time your will have a dropping jaw. Some of the plots bits and pieces may seem familiar if you're a routine animation fan or a comic fan. Especially when Superman left Krypton to find his new home in Earth.The voice acting is great as well. Farrell and Brad who we have never seeing together in a real movie just makes lot of sense in this animation.'Megamind' is a nice family entertainer. It will make you laugh and gaze at wonderful quality animation throughout. It will make you realize that a super hero is of no use without a villain and every villain has some good in them. And no matter what color you belong to white, black or blue some day you will have a change of heart when you fall in love.Read my reviews at www.flickshout.blogspot.com"
75,Megamind,10,18 February 2011,Best dreamworks film ever!,Back in December of 2010 me and my aunt went and to go see this movie not in 3D at a theater and what I think of it I think it is Dreamwork's best if not the best of all because it is kinda tied with the first Shrek in my opinion but me and my aunt loved it.The story is basically about good against evil in which the villain defeats the hero and becomes bored and thinks his life is lacking with no one to fight with and creates a new hero who becomes evil so he must defeat him and Will Ferrell did a great job as Megamind as well as the other actors.So I give Megamind an 10 out of 10 you should really see this movie it is Funny! Now I think my favorite Character in the movie had to be Minion he was really cool looking and the face he does after he was pretending to die was very cute as well he was voiced by David Cross who also voiced Crane in Kung Fu Panda.So Megamind is in my opinion Dreamwork's best film next to Shrek to date 10 stars.
76,Megamind,7,13 February 2011,Good.... Standard Plot..,"It is extraordinary! When you this movie you'll wonder that the Megamind is the bad one and maybe it is a movie for ""the enemy"" perspective.I think it would be better if the movie is given a superhero soul, like The Incredibles. The scenes was not placed well, but it's still entertaining. My suggestion is that you have to focus on the plot and still have a purpose.I like it for my weekend and congratulation to all contributors. I hope there is a sequel, Megamind 2!!! ^_^Thank you."
77,Megamind,4,17 December 2010,A horrible animation film,"Back in 2001, when Shrek was released, the studio DreamWorks Animation loomed to be an authentic rival of Pixar, with the potential of even surpassing it for not being subject to the marketing whims from Disney.However, almost 10 years later, it is clear that Shrek was an exception, because even though DremWorks made a few good movies after Shrek (Shrek 2, Shrek Forever After, Over the Hedge and Kung Fu Panda), I think that most of the films produced by that company range from mediocre to horrible.But the studio keeps trying, by copying formulas and always trusting that the abuse of references to the popular culture will rescue them.Megamind is another bad animation movie from DreamWorks.Despite the solid voice acting, Megamind did not make me laugh even once.The actors make their best to bring the forced and lacking of any spark dialogs to life, and the few commentaries which are barely likable only stress the lack of originality and ingenuity from the pathetic screenplay.Co-screenwriters Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons tried to make a tribute to the world of the comics, and the references to the archetypes which abound in the super-hero movies are not absent; however, the simple repetition of clichés is not a synonymous of real humor.In fact, with so many interesting ""deconstructions"" of heroes and villains (from The Incredibles and Despicable Me to more mature movies such as Defendor and Kick-Ass), Megamind feels redundant and unnecessary...something which could have been ignored if the film had been funny; but well, I already spoke about that.And if you think that this is only the typical reaction from an embittered old man like me, I have to add that the whole cinema was alarmingly silent, even during the most elaborated ""comical"" sequences.And no, not even a soundtrack full of classic rock was enough to dispel the unlikeable air of corporate committee which is noticeable in every scene of Megamind.On the positive side, the animation is good; however, any visual attribute is immediately forgotten when we face the poor story.I lost the count of all the times I looked to my watch during the ""exciting"" final battle, because I was desperately waiting for the holy end credits to come.And I was surprised when I checked that the running time of Megamind is only of 95 minutes, because I truly felt that it was near the two hours.In conclusion, Megamind is a disastrous hybrid between Despicable Me and The Incredibles, but without the pleasantness from the first one or the ingenuity from the second one.In other words, Megamind is a badly done copy which came too late and with a boring and insipid screenplay.In summary, another false move from DreamWorks, at least in my humble opinion."
78,Megamind,8,5 November 2010,"Megamind with the voices of Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Brad Pitt is a wonderful parody of the superhero genre","On the day of its premiere, my movie theatre-working friend and I decided to watch computer-animated Megamind this afternoon. The story seems to be another Superman parody/tribute as we see the origins of Metro Man (Brad Pitt) and the title character (Will Ferrell). Then when they've grown into the hero/villain they become, a reporter named Roxanne (Tina Fey) gets mixed in. But after that, many twists and turns come that take many humorous and even touching scenes entertainingly through a, what seems, a naturally organic plane. And they mostly seem to earn every highly amused and heartfelt emotion I got out of it all. And watching all those action scenes in 3-D added immensely to the experience. Kudos to all for a such wonderful experience provided to my friend and I. So yes, I highly recommend Megamind."
79,Megamind,,2 January 2011,Emotionally complex,"This film is about a villain who loses his sense of purpose after his enemy, the hero, dies in a battle.""Megamind"" tells the story of a wounded boy who turns villainous to build his identity. The plot continues to be emotionally complex throughout the whole plot, as he struggles with the lost of identity after the death of the superhero. ""Megamind"" is probably the most emotionally complex animation I have seen.There are also much for kids to enjoy. The film is exciting, with lots of superhero action and fighting. The characters are well designed but I don't see them as being very cuddly, which may not bode well to merchandise sales."
80,Megamind,6,18 November 2010,Not Great But Pretty Good,"I took my entire family to the theatre tonight where we watched this movie, the kids really enjoyed this a lot at least for the first hour of the movie, and even better my partner and I were not completely bored like we are at most ""kid movies"". The action scenes were pretty entertaining and well done for a kid movie too. My partner enjoyed it almost as much as the kids, more so than they enjoyed the lame Alpha and Omega which I thought was awful and I could barely sit through. This movie got really boring for me really fast but at least I could sit through it and there were a few funny parts through the whole movie, enough to keep me awake at least :) I guess most of you know what the plot is, so I guess there is no need to go into it. It is just campy superhero fun and involves super powers and the super heroes who wield those powers. The only problem is there's been way too many superhero and animated superhero movies especially as of late so it got kind of boring quick for me and my partner, and the kids just got tired by the end."
81,Megamind,7,16 November 2010,"Good Story, Great Characters, Big Laughs","This movie is not as good as other Dreamworks animated movies, but is still very good. I don't think the kids will like it as much as the adults. The themes explored are a little ""dark"" and the characters are quite layered and complex (for an animated movie), which is what I really liked about it, but I think it's a turn off for younger children. The humor is also geared more towards adults (probably 35+), as is the music. For me, I was vigorously laughing and slapping my knee during a ""tribute"" to Marlon Brando. I don't think many kids are familiar with the reference. It made it funnier for me having recently seen the Bluray version of Superman 2, with never before seen footage of Marlon Brando.I do have to mention, as someone else did, that I was disappointed with how much Megamind looked like Gallaxhar (from another Dreamworks movie: Monsters vs Aliens). They are both blue with giant heads. You would think that if you are designing an alien, you basically could get as creative as you want, so why simply replicate another character? Still, Megamind is a great character. The best villains are always the ones who have things about them that you like or can relate to. There is plenty of that in this character. As a matter of fact, all the main characters have something about them that is unexpected, except for one.The biggest disappointment in the film was the character of Roxanne. I know she was designed to be a regular person, but that doesn't mean they had to design her to look so uninteresting and plain. I was amazed with how expressive Megamind's face was, yet Roxanne's character looked so bland. Tina Fey added absolutely nothing to the character, which is exactly what happened when she voiced a character in Ponyo. This woman is supposedly so funny, yet that hasn't been seen (or heard) on the big screen. Everyone else did a great job (David Cross was his usual awesome self).By the way, shame on you Dreamworks for releasing a scene that basically gives away the biggest twist in the movie. Thanks a lot!"
82,Megamind,1,26 November 2010,Not a good choice for young girls,"Just got home from seeing this movie with my 8 and 6-year old daughters. Where do I begin? We all thought this movie was boring and way too long. A lot of the humor in the movie was above my kids' heads. However, my biggest problem with this movie is that the entire plot revolved around several male characters (heros and villains) are all vying for the affection of one unrealistically large-breasted, doe-eyed woman who must be rescued by the men. The movie also contained typical unhealthy body stereotypes... the woman has huge boobs, tiny body, perfect face, huge eyes, etc. The hero(s) have huge muscles and ""perfect"" bodies, and the villains/nerds are either scrawny or fat. Another complaint I have with this movie is that they reveal that the tooth fairy and Easter bunny are not real. I mean SERIOUSLY, why do they have to say that in a kid's movie!?!? I would like my daughters to maintain their innocence as long as possible. I'm sure a lot of people will tell me to lighten up, but I feel so compelled to post this for other parents of young girls who might want to know what they are getting in to before they see this movie. And my girls thought it was boring anyway."
83,Megamind,4,7 January 2011,Moderately sized mind,"This film is 1/3 a great movie, 1/3 a decent flick that could make for at least a decent studio filler before Dreamworks' Kung Fu Panda 2, and 1/3 a boring snoozefest that was definitely not worth catching a 9 PM screening of. Maybe Dreamworks is starting to run out of original ideas- it seems to be their best animated stuff is adaptations- Shrek, How To Train Your Dragon, etc. Not to say I didn't like Monsters Vs. Aliens or Kung Fu Panda, but I feel as if when they derive, they are in their own little league.I saw the trailer with Toy Story 3. It looked like a good movie- Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, etc. That, plus its concept of a deconstruction of superhero movie seemed funny, except I already saw that 3 months beforehand when I went and saw Despicable Me 3D. Nonetheless I chose to ignore the warning signs and went in.The movie was working for 20 minutes. Especially in its opening scenes, with how we're introduced to how Megamind is apparently having the worst day of his life, as he is falling to his death. I will admit I laughed at the ""Aw, a baby! How flattering."" line, the childhood was cute, and I was just generally loving it.Then the second act came, where Megamind was bored because he's officially defeated Metro Man and there's nothing to do. That's quite symbolic because not a lot happens (at least that I am able to remember for the life of me) happens in this period of time, except for Megamind posing as a janitor and falling in love with Tina Fey. This is where the film nearly made me fall asleep. At that point, I started worrying and kept thinking ""Who approved of this deft, uneven script?"" However, the last 10 minutes is where the film started to feel like it found its niche and at least passed for an entertaining action packed finale. It's like, there's a good 20 minutes of brilliance, an hour of boring filler, then 10 minutes of the brilliance that got the film off to a good start. As satisfied as I was that the film had a good last 10 minutes, 30 minutes out of 90 doesn't a good film make.It just seems like Dreamworks thought that they hit their mark with the stellar How To Train Your Dragon, found Universal was producing Despicable Me while someone had The Incredibles playing in the background and thought ""OMG GUYS. UNIVERSAL HAS A SWEET CONCEPT. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO IT AND RISE TO THEIR LEVEL OF Brilliance. OH AND LET'S BRING IN SOME STUFF FROM THE INCREDIBLES!!!"" I crap you not. I got reminded several times of Despicable Me and The Incredibles, which is not a good thing. It just shows that they felt like they needed more money, so after doing what was said above, they'd release it as a sort of filler flick for their paychecks before KFP2 came out. Because they've gotta keep bringing in bucks by the buckets somehow. It also doesn't help that the equally mediocre Shrek Forever After had the same feel, despite being better than Shrek 3.To be fair, a lot of the movie has a ""going through the motions"" feel to it. It seems like the writers got really lazy halfway into writing and went, ""Hey, we released a real sleeper hit this year!!! No need to be creative or make sure people find the jokes funny, we can turn our grocery shopping lists into a 3D movie and it'd be a smash!!!"". None of the jokes seem fresh. The plot seems bored and done a million times before. It just feels done, and I could have spent my money elsewhere.In short, Megamind is really just a boring movie, obviously released so Dreamworks can get more money. It just feels flat, tired, bored, done a million times before and even beautiful animation/good 3D cannot save this film from being the boring, convoluted mess it is. Skip it.Well, Pixar, it's safe to say you don't have to worry about your jobs anymore."
84,Megamind,8,4 November 2010,A Nutshell Review: Megamind,"The handsomest and most evil genius of all time versus the hero who fights with well- coiffured hair and a smirk, and a hero wannabe who decides that his newly gained powers is an avenue for sloth and riches. If there's one thing consistent in Megamind the film, that will be the huge ego issues everyone seems to possess, from Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) to Metro Man (Brad Pitt) to Tighten (best kept under wraps in case the trailers haven't ruined the surprise).Megamind touches on the classic tale of purpose, destiny and purpose. I wanted to prefix those attributes with ""human"", but these two sworn enemies of Metro City actually hail from outer space, where their home planets get engulfed by a black hole, but not before both get to spiral out of their planets through their rocketships ala the mythos of Superman. Finding themselves landing on earth, one becomes a city's protector because of the good nurturing done, while the other got the shorter end of the stick landing inside prison, and through a series of misfortune decided that enough's enough, and throws his weight on the other side of the moral spectrum.The film turns the superhero genre on its head, and one of the most obvious spins the storytellers here have a field day with is Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster 's Superman, with Metro Man clearly modelled after the Last Son of Krypton with his do-gooder ways and blessed with similar superpowers of flight, strength and that heat vision, and Megamind that of Lex Luthor, but infused with a lot more comedy which also came courtesy of a fishy sidekick aptly called Minion (David Cross). Then there's Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) who is the equivalent of Lois Lane, the news reporter with whom everyone associates a love relationship with Metro Man, and Hal (Jonah Hill) her geeky cameraman for the TV news channel who clearly has the hots for her. You'll earn your ticket back with a penny for every Supes related element discovered in the film.It's the familiarity of the characters here that augments the enjoyment of this animated piece by Dreamworks, and clearly when done right like the film here, it's a whole lot of fun, and brilliantly animated as well with a decent romantic core the catalyzes the second half rivalry between Megamind and his creation. The film plays on the notion of how there has to be evil in order for good to triumph over, of how we prepare for war to keep the peace, and how heroes get defined by the villainy they go up against. That, as well as the usual never judging a book by its cover and the likes of the usual moralistic messages in Alan J Schoolcraft and Brent Simons' story, makes it rather preachy at times.But for comic book and superhero fans, this film probably addresses square on why villains appeal, because they make the heroes look good, and if there should be the disappearance of either side, the entire sense of purpose would probably vanish, and interest waned. It is this thought that gets played out in a lot of detail in Megamind as the anti-hero struggles to find his place in society, and discover good values that far outweigh what he has been conditioned for.An eclectic soundtrack of contemporary songs also fit in well into the film, and one from the late King of Pop naturally found its way into the finale. With a host of voice talents such as J.K. Simmons, Justin Theroux and even Ben Stiller at its disposal lending cameo appearances, Megamind has what it takes to entertain, and although I didn't watch this in 3D, none of the scenes witnessed do require that format, other than for a handful of deliberately created ones which I thought Metro Man's flight in the beginning of the film en route to his rescue of Roxanne, will probably take the cake."
85,Megamind,6,8 January 2011,Too cheesy,"I realize that not every cartoon movie can be of the same quality as ""How to train your dragon"" or ""Wall-e"", but come on. They recruited such high profile actors as Will Ferrel and Brad Pitt for the voices, so animation and jokes must be accordingly funny as well as touching elements of the plot. Besides first part of the movie - the idea of super villain beating super hero, looks nice, but afterwards it looks down the hill. Animation is mediocre at very best. It can't be compared to previously mentioned cartoons neither by quality of animation nor by the level of interest of it's characters (beside megamind himself). On the plus side, it's a nice cartoon to take the kids to."
86,Megamind,6,7 November 2010,"Don't expect The Incredibles, Expect a Will Ferrel movie in CG","As my title suggests ,if you go in expecting Pixar, you will be disappointed , but if you expect another Will Ferrel movie, you will have tons of fun, And it is interesting to watch a Will Ferrel movie in CG and without the adult toilet jokes, you don't see that everyday.This is a kind of movie which can be enjoyed both by adults and kids, it has a decent story , good animation and I liked the supporting cast, it's not great or epic as the Incredibles ,it's just simply funny... this a safe movie to see with kids,i am absolutely sure they will enjoy this one.It's a good movie if you're looking for something to watch with the kids."
87,Megamind,,7 July 2016,ironic portrait,"touching, amusing, seductive, different by many other contemporary animations. because it not propose entertainment, has not ambition to impress and the story is almost too honest for many tastes. its great virtue is status of precise portrait of contemporary society. about the ambiguity of values, about old heroes/models , about self definition in a competitive society. and, sure, about love. its purpose - to reflect about every day themes. its good point - a strange, fragile bad guy who becomes hero against obstacles. Megamind could be the icon of the resistance against chaotic manner to discover life. and that does this film special. because it is invitation to courage to be yourself. because propose an ironic portrait of solid determined things in new light. because the romanticism makes not so bitter a story who balance between Oliver Twist and retreat Elvis Presley.because it is inciting invitation to think yourself."
88,Megamind,10,27 December 2015,Mega-Great!,"Megamind (2010): Dir: Tom McGrath / Voices: Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, David Cross: Grand masterpiece animation about exploration between good and evil. Megamind is propelled to evil while his counterpart Metro Man always saved the day. When he finally succeeds everything becomes dull until he decides to create a new superhero to dire consequence. Directed by Tom McGrath with glorious colorful images including our hilarious big blue-headed anti-hero voiced by Will Ferrell. Megamind is such a failure that when he does succeed, he cannot grasp its reality. A great story point regards how he and Metro Man landed on Earth and how they were brought up, but it is inevitable that the good inside him is the product of ignorance. Tina Fey voices Roxanne Ritchi, a reporter caught between several suitors. She has been abducted so many times and fell witness to so many schemes that she can merely criticize Megamind's methods. Jonah Hill voices her cameraman who will become the accidental successor to Megamind who had intentions with his powers that ultimately became the product that places Megamind in position to accept what he never accepted or realized. Brad Pitt voices Metro Man, tired of the routine heroism to the point where defeat is a welcome sigh of relief. David Cross voices Megamind's sidekick who happens to be a gold fish and smarter than he is. The animation is colorful with many hilarious comic lines thrown out with full blown sarcasm. Great animated filmmaking about crossing over to the greener, or bluer grasses. Score: 10 / 10"
89,Megamind,8,20 September 2015,Mega-Fun,"The comedic twist on the superhero genre is nothing new, nor is the take on seeing a super-villain in a new light as seen with Despicable Me. So the main question was could DreamWorks make an effective blend of the two with Megamind? I think they succeeded. It is nothing that other films of this type haven't touched upon before, but the smart script and fun characters really help make the film stand-out. It has plenty of laughs, it gets its references spot on and it has a surprising amount of dramatic moments.So what is the plot? Well a super-villain named Megamind has an ongoing battle against superhero Metro Man, constantly being defeated. One day Megamind actually manages to defeat his nemesis and take over the city, but quickly realises there is no fun if he has nobody to face and tries to create a new hero to do battle with. It's a relatively straight-forward plot, but what really makes the film work is its excellent characters. Along the way Megamind develops an attraction towards a reporter he usually kidnaps and the hero he chooses turns out to be not so ideal for the role. I was interested in the romance that developed, I enjoyed seeing Megamind train this new hero and I found that the interactions between the characters were always engaging.Megamind (an excellent Will Ferrell) has all you want in a main character. He finds being evil fun and it's hard to disagree with him at times, but you feel for him throughout and his transition into a more heroic character feels very natural. Roxanne (Tina Fey) is a fantastic female lead. Sure she is something of a damsel, but it is always played for laughs and she is just a well-balanced character. She's feisty and intelligent, but she's also gentle and vulnerable in a very human way. Minion (the always solid David Cross) is an enjoyable foil for Megamind and Metro Man (Brad Pitt) turns out to be a fun twist on the superhero. I found Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill) annoying and too goofy at first, but the more he grows into his superhero role the better he gets. The animation is fantastic as usual from DreamWorks and all the characters have interesting designs. There is just something about the way they animate that simulates motion and movement especially well. Whether it be for some slapstick or for the action scenes it just looks excellent every time. Something that impressed me was how well music was used in the film. The score by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe is aptly heroic and upbeat, but it was also fantastically integrated with songs by the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, AC/DC and Guns N' Roses. Frequently this method falls flat or the songs date the film, but they are all used smartly and in suitable scenes when they appear.The comic references were very good. The similarities to Superman are done well and I especially enjoyed Megamind pretending to be Marlon Brando's Jor-El during the training scenes. The script and the dialogue really shine here, I was invested in Megamind's various dilemmas and I was intrigued as the how everything was going to pan out. I found the connection that developed between Megamind and Roxanne to be very believable, when I was initially worried that it would come off as forced. There are also some smart changes to the typical superhero formula, especially towards the end, that worked to the films advantage. It may be a touch predictable for some and I don't think it breaks any new ground, but I found Megamind to be really enjoyable. The plot is just different enough to be engaging, the animation is very impressive yet again and it's more serious moments are just as effective as its comedic ones. But I believe that it is the characters that give the film its biggest strength. Everything from the voice acting to the designs to the interactions they have just worked to near perfection. Megamind is definitely an entertaining take on the superhero/super-villain genre."
90,Megamind,10,24 May 2015,Presentation is all the makes it stand out!,"Megamind is a movie that shows that good exists everywhere, even in bad, i.e. bad is not totally bad but contains a certain amount of good in it and some trigger is required to grow and bring it out. Moreover, the movie shows victory of good over evil (in the beginning, Metroman over Megamind and in later when Megamind changes, Megamind over Titan) and try to give a positive message to all. Presentation makes everything stand out, of course it does, as Megamind says in the movie, the movie really stands out and I hope it has and will stand out due to its presentation. Kudos and all the best for the success it has gained over time and hope everyone likes it."
91,Megamind,7,28 October 2013,more serious without the cute minions,"Villain Megamind (Will Ferrell) is an alien sent to Earth growing up alongside good guy Metro Man (Brad Pitt). While love and support showered Metro Man, Megamind was despised growing up in a prison. Then in one of his evil schemes, Megamind surprisingly kills Metro Man by accidentally discovering his copper weakness. Megamind loses his reason for being when he doesn't have a good guy to oppose him. So he sets out to create a good guy hero. Only it completely backfires, and Megamind must figure out how to save the day.There is some fun in this. The evil schemes should be more silly and less deadly. To start off the movie by killing a character is a little bit morbid and a little bit too serious. The twist is great. It takes the whole superhero genre much more seriously than the usual kiddie fare.The biggest problem is that this followed the much cuter Despicable Me. This is a more serious themed movie while the other villain led movie is a wacky cartoon. Even though both have minions, the Despicable Minions are super cute and super hilarious. Megamind just doesn't sell as well."
92,Megamind,10,29 May 2013,Fantastic...,"This film is fantastic. I cannot believe I had missed watching it till now. Its a laugh riot. The plot is seemingly unique as well. You wont get an adorable super villain anywhere other than the Metrocity...... And i personally feel that this film is underrated at IMDb. It deserves to be up there with the top animation movies of all time. Well, it is for me...... The film is not just about animation and cartoon and that sort of stuff. It sends a clear message to the audience that there lies a good in every bit of bad as well. And even good cannot be that good after all, as it lies surrounded by the bad. Watch it if you haven't. Don't miss this one. Its not Disney, its not Pixar..but it is totally worth it. One word.... Fantastic....."
93,Megamind,9,3 April 2013,Mega (Blows My) Mind,"Okay, I've said it before, Will Ferrell is grossly over-hyped as a comedic genius when virtually every character he has ever played is actually a thinly-veiled clone of the last character he played; so when a role comes around with some actual character meat on it for him to play something other than the world's biggest idiot who lucks into likability by doing absolutely nothing, he actually starts to prove he just might be actually capable of doing some real comedy. That role is ""Megamind,"" a blue-skinned large fore-headed alien sent to Earth and raised by prison inmates at the same time the last son of a rival planet is raised by wealthy parents. It's not much of a superhero movie in as much as it actually attacks and turns the whole ""superhero"" mythos (particularly the Superman archetype) on its ear, analyzing it and taking it to both some logical and absurd conclusions. Along the way, the laughs come from character personalities and the absurdity of trying to be a costumed crime-fighter. Will Ferrell actually does very well voicing Megamind as a under-appreciated genius looking for acceptance in attacking the one person holding him back, namely Metro-Man, voiced by the very excellent Brad Pitt, getting a chance to really over-act and pump out some bravado, but still maintaining his humility. Tina Fey is equally excellent as the hero's lady sidekick unsure where she fits in his life, and David Cross, yes, Tobias from ""Arrested Development,"" provides the voice of the cynical fish in a bowl on the robotic gorilla body as well as a lot of the humor and the voice of reason in the movie as Megamind's opinionated conscience. It really is an excellent movie, even with Will Ferrell in it, and the animation is superb. The only thing that would have made it better would have been some stinking Special Features on the DVD."
94,Megamind,8,9 February 2013,"Megamind, Dreamwork's Own  ""Zero To Hero"" and I Kinda like it","Ahhh....Lets talk about Megamind,You know after so much praise and acclaim Pixar received for Incredibles, Dreamworks thought they could do their own stir on the superhero theme, and to be honest they had a nice theme to it, a super villain becoming a hero. The downside: the formulas been done too many times. I lost my interest when Will Ferell, Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill David Cross and Tina Fey were are characters. Sounds more like SNL rather than Animation movie, but when I watched it I found it not only decent but genuinely amusing.Story and Characters So whats the story.Megamind and Metro Man were two alien babies who were launched onto earth from their planets , Metro Man received all the goodness of fate, while Megamind received the bad.And So the clash of good and evil were begun , but soon megamind finally wins, kills Metro Man, and is ruler of the city. But soons gets bored and wants to create a hero. His plan backfires and now the title of hero is given to Megamind.So like I said, formula was done, but this had something good to it. Now the characters I'll start with the passable: Brad is not much in the film but for what he is , he's okay , typical over the top cool and suave hero , not really an eye catcher, and Tina fey is your token girl for the movie. I think because she didn't have much change really didn't help bring the romance between them, which I really like in the films. The good: I liked Jonah in this movie, its the kind of like which you never seen coming, A lazy bum becoming a hero , has it heart torn up and becomes psycho evil , I kinda enjoy that. But of course the stars of the movie are Will Ferrel and David Cross, I really really love these guys , they relationship was nice beyond belief, they got the villain and minion are boss and employee , but best of friends and that alone got me interested. Just watch the banter between minion and megamind, its definitely worth your timeSo what is good to me in my opinion: Like I said Megamind , Minion and Tighten are superb characters to have fun with, the action was pretty good and the plot while clichéd had some unique changes. To me this is an another example of dreamworks making TV characters as movies, the main things that most people lie could be on their home screen and doesn't tackle a moral differently like Pixar, but for what i watched , I can honestly say they did pretty well , Certainly not my top 5 favourite dreamworks film , but maybe a top 10 perhaps.On the whole Megamind has at least the power to hook me with its nicely done humor. A 7.5 out of 10. Not great but good , a nice diversion from the usual animation films I watch"
95,Megamind,8,10 January 2013,"Fun, Animated Superhero Spin-off!","Megamind is not the most spectacular animated film I have ever seen but it still is highly entertaining. This film has a few things working in it's favor. It has a highly-talented voice cast, has great, bright animation, and it reminds me of many great superhero films I have seen.This film is about a villain with that weird-looking blue head who conquers the city's hero. When he gets lonely because he has no enemy, he creates a hero so he would have someone to fight. But, this ""hero"" is more than Megamind expected. He has to deal with that and there is that newscaster lady he is interested in.....Megamind excels with a brilliant, talented voice cast led by Will Ferrell and Brad Pitt. Those two were really great and we even get to hear Brad Pitt sing. I also liked the character connections between Megamind and his fishy friend, Minion. I really liked the fishy guy.Overall, this is a solid film that most kids will enjoy. It is obvious that this film recycles plot points from better films such as The Incredibles, Superman, X-Men, and Despicable Me. But that did nothing to stop me from enjoying the movie. I rate this film 8/10."
96,Megamind,,29 October 2012,http://theojreviews.blogspot.com,"Megamind came out in 2010 and is based on a villain in the usual Hero VS Villain world. The story line went a completely different way than I expected though the trailers didn't provide too much story. The film itself was quite good although some parts I did feel were a bit stupid. The hero, known as Metro Man, looks as though he is a main character in the plot but he only really appears at the beginning. It all centres on Megamind himself who realises he isn't really a villain. So he does some things (not to spoil) that backfires and that creates an even badder villain. A love story is sort of intertwined but it wasn't really needed. Over all I would probably watch it again if it was on TV but its not the best film I've ever seen."
97,Megamind,10,31 May 2012,Very Entertaining Movie.,"Megamind is not only funny and entertaining to watch, but its also touching and 'smartfully' written. I love how they've shown the good versus bad throughout the story. There's not a moment when I was bored watching it. The humor is superb!It also shows emotional connection with the viewers. At certain mushy parts, I was actually able to relate to some of the lines and spiels of some of the characters. This is not an average family movie. It is masterfully created to cater to all ages.I give it - 10 Stars."
98,Megamind,8,17 May 2012,Bad for good,"I'm a bit of a comic buff and have enjoyed most of the glut of action and animated super- hero features since ""Superman"" blazed the trail back in the 70's. Of course in Toon land even more things are possible, including 3D action as in this highly amusing spoof comedy- adventure which neatly inverts the good guy and bad guy stereotypes we're so familiar with. Here, the good guy, Metro Man is a pretentious, vainglorious super-smoothie, who quickly tires of the status and responsibilities his powers confer on him, while the so-called bad guy Megamind turns out to be a sensitive, conscientious loner, looking for love and female companionship. In the middle of them stands feisty Lois Lane-type reporter Roxanne, who despite herself finds herself falling for the adopted persona of the baddie.The film makes subtle points about being true to one's self, not judging by appearances and overcoming prejudice but never at the expense of some spectacularly drawn action sequences or hilarious verbal and sight gags, the best of which was probably the mickey-take of Marlon Brando's Jor-El in the afore-mentioned ""Superman - The Movie"". The 3D content only enhanced my enjoyment, especially a replica scene of the famous James Dean ""Boulevard Of Broken Dreams"" poster.For me, this sharp-as-a-tack production joins the hallowed ranks of ""The Incredibles"" and ""Mystery Men"" as thoroughly enjoyable send-ups of a still burgeoning cinematic phenomenon, as witness the continuing graduation of DC and Marvel Comic heroes to Hollywood blockbuster status."
99,Megamind,7,8 April 2012,Presentation!,"Megamind's basic concept of telling a superhero story from the villain's POV is an appealing one - and it's one that has been done many times before. It would have been shocking and original back in the 70's, but unfortunately for Dreamworks, the movie's biggest potential target market - fans of comic books and superhero comics in particular - have seen this already, including, notably, Joss Whedon's ""Dr. Horrible's Singalong Blog"" and Kurt Busiek ""Astro City"" comics, both of which had more spark than Megamind. As a result the movie has to rely on the most basic of genre-based jokes, and the parody it attempts of superheroes and their psychology is one that has been explored to death.That basic premise is milked for all its worth though, and while it doesn't serve for any real insight about the genre, about good and bad or about destiny, it does make for a lot of good jokes. And while the premise itself runs out of fuel about thirty minutes into, and at that point the genre savvy viewer will be able to figure out just how the rest of the story goes, there's enough hilarious dialog and visual gags to make it enjoyable throughout; just like the animation is slightly behind the times, but still solid enough to get the gags across. Megmind is very well edited and paced, with some very memorable scenes and a great soundtrack. It's not one of Dreamworks' best but it's terrific entertainment."
100,Megamind,8,8 March 2012,The villain becomes the hero,"Superheroes are all the rage these days, comic books are incredibly popular and since 2000 there has not been a year where there no tent pole film that is not a superhero film. In 2008 we got a superhero parody in the form Hancock but ended up becoming more like an action blockbuster. Dreamworks have also attempted an superhero comedy in the form of animation with Megamind.Megamind (Will Ferrell) is a blue, super-intelligent alien send to Earth as his home planet is sucked into a black hole. His archrival Metro Man (Brad Pitt) home planet also suffers the same fate. Both have very different upbringings, Metro Man growing up in wealth, luxury and always the golden boy, Megamind ended up in a prison of criminally gifted and because he is unable to impress of people ends up becoming a villain. In the city of Metro City (or Metrocity to Megamind) they have elaborate battles, with Metro Man being hailed as the hero. But one day Megamind some how won, killing Metro Man. The problem is that Metro Man had no plan to what to do afterwards and ends up depressed because he has no one to battle with. Megamind decides to create a new hero to battle with, making Titan (Jonah Hill). But Megamind also starts to fall for reporter Lois Lane, I mean Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey).Like most Dreamworks films the animation is excellent and the action sequence with its camera movements were exciting. It is an action packed, inventive and will please people of all ages. Director Tom McGrath made sure that Megamind zipped along at a very quick pace and when the score did make some of the moments truly epic.There was some good ideas in Megamind, like Megamind become evil because of his surrounding and that all good in his world is taken by someone else. It is the classic nature vs. nurture argument and there were ideas like the villain actually needs a hero to challenge them. It is like The Joker in The Dark Knight where he is only happy and motivated to do anything if Batman is there to challenge and what would a villain do if they actually win? What would their post victory strategy be? But the Megamind is a missed opportunity because instead of trying parody superheroes, they made a more physical, slapstick heavy comedy. There were some funny jokes, I did laugh but I wanted more verbal jokes and less of Megamind and Minion getting hurt. I wanted more observation humour, picking at holes that might happen in comic book and Saturday Morning Cartoons, which this film was good at.There is a recurring joke that Megamind can not pronounce some words, I thought it was more a pointless quirk then a funny joke and I personally do not like Jonah Hill: I do not think he is very funny and his performance was pretty weak. I also thought the parody vision of Marlon Brando's version of Jol-El was unfunny, poorly written and just felt very forced by Ferrell.The similarly themed The Incredibles is a much better film, but Megamind is an entertaining enough film, especially for children who enjoy superheroes.7.5/10"
101,Megamind,8,7 March 2012,"A sure One time watch. if u haven't seen it, go for it!","well, had i seen it before having seen the kung fu pandas, it could have been on the list of my 5 favourite animated movies.!! a nice watch. has a great beginning and a surely interesting and exciting end (also the surprise twist is quite good..!) and has many really good moments throughout. positives:- good animations, action packed with thrills, several good comedy punchlines and overall a good message. negatives:- gets a bit too emotional in the middle, it should have had a little bit more comedy elementsoverall:- a sure Saturday night with-family watch or a light time light movie watch.......!"

103,Megamind,10,3 February 2012,Megamind is the Best Animated film since Shrek.,"This is one of the best movies i have ever seen, despite it been animated the story line is awesome and creative, coming out with a brilliant trend to swap the villain, mega-mind in place of the long lost hero, metro-man. Countless hilarious moments, i can never get bored of this movie. Got to say i mean you have to get bored having to be used to seen the continues superhero, villain story line, but this movie is certainly unique in its kind. Will Ferrell is superb in the movie, i love the accent, i would have never guess it was Ferrell until i was told. It an action-adventure comedy movie that keeps you anticipated every scene. No time to be grinding on your pop corn because u will certainly miss a chuckle or two."
104,Megamind,9,27 January 2012,I love it! What else can I say?,"Usually I take my reviews relatively seriously through many a paragraph, but in this case, I'm just going to keep it quick and to the point. ""Megamind"" is a thrill to watch! With a healthy dose of animated action fun, lots of good humor, and even some adorable sentimentality, I enjoyed every second of it.Probably my favorite feature of this film was the animation. While I still think 2D is the best way to go, this was undeniably a gorgeous film to look at.Especially the eyes! Wow! Beautiful.Also, the voice acting was quite good, and the story was both funny, exciting, and heartwarming all at once. While it may not be the most original thing to ever hit the screen, there's no denying its quality. This is a film that people of all ages can enjoy - without the need for hidden innuendos and hinting towards 'naughty' words *cough* Rango *cough*. So go ahead, get the whole family together and watch ""Megamind""! Seriously. It will not disappoint!"
105,Megamind,7,25 January 2012,Quite Entertaining and good movie.,"Megamind is a anti-hero type of a movie, with some moments of humour, and excellent voice acting by the impressive cast, along with great animation from the work team. It is a bit like a parody of superman with the first scene showing Megamind landing on earth quite similar to how superman was shown landing(but much more funnier),and also the actions and gadgets in the movie is quite good, showing how a mind of a supervillain works.This movie is about an Alien Supervillain named Megamind, who finally defeats his arch enemy Metro Man(protector of Metrocity) after years of trying to defeat him and those tries always ending in defeat and Megamind in prison. But when he defeats Metro Man, , he becomes sad and bored because of no superhero to fight against. So he makes a normal human into a superhero,but that fails misrabely when the guy becomes a supervillain himself,and Megamind now must save Metro City!The Voice Acting by Will Ferrell as Megamind is very good, and also along with great voice acting from Brad pitt as Metro man, Jonah Hill as Hal, and Tina Fey as Roxie(who is Megamind's crush).Great work from the animation team, making the movie of Megamind a bit like a parody version of Superman,and also well done by the director Tom McGrath,because its never easy to make a animated movie.Finally,Megamind is a quite enjoyable movie with some moments of humour,and people of all ages will surely enjoy it."
106,Megamind,7,27 December 2011,Famous voices Animation Superheroes Crazy comedy antics Who could ask for more?,"This is another of those blockbuster animated films that uses the voices of famous stars to sell it. Well that's what I was led to believe from the hype anyway. At the end of the day I decided it wasn't all that bad. As far as I'm concerned, anyone could be supplying the voices in this one; it's the writing that makes it (for me). I'm sure contributions were made by those involved, but the basic storyline would have remained the same and it's the story that holds the thing together. Of course I was also immune to the 3D because I watched it in exactly the same number of dimensions the screen has. But I digress, here's a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.With their planets doomed, two babies are sent towards Earth. One lands at a mansion and is brought up in a privileged home. He has superpowers and grows up to be the good guy: Metro Man. The other, well he lands in a prison, has no superpowers, but a genius mind and he becomes the bad guy: Megamind. The pair have many battles over the years with Metro Man always finishing with the upper hand. But this time it would be different; this time Megamind has a particularly evil plan. He kidnaps Metro Man's girlfriend, reporter Roxanne Ritchie, and lures Metro Man to his doom. But will the destruction of Metro Man give Megamind everything he wants? Well, I'm afraid the Spoiler Police would really not like me telling you that and anyway, they've threatened me with the 'forget-me stick' if I tell.The animation is up to DreamWorks' usual standard, nothing particularly extraordinary about it really. I love the soundtrack, but then again, put AC/DC, Ozzy Osbourne and Guns 'n' Roses in there and I'm yours! (I saw at least two of them in the same bill once). Performance wise, well everyone did a decent job, so I'll give honourable mentions to the voice talents of; Will Ferrell as Megamind, Tina Fey as Roxanne Ritchie, Brad Pitt as Metro Man, Jonah Hill as Hal Stewart/ Titan, David Cross as Minion and Ben Stiller as Bernard.The whole story is told from the point of view of Megamind which makes for an interesting dynamic. You end up sympathising with the bad guy and that, I guess, is what makes the whole thing work. I liked the storyline, but I suspect it may have been a little too complicated for younger members of the audience. They also fall into the trap of putting little nods to older films so the parents don't get bored, I suppose, and this is all getting a little cliché Hollywood. Still, it's pretty entertaining over all and one that's worth a look 'Recommended'.My score: 7.3/10.IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 50,452 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 72/100 (based on 170 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 73/100 (based on 93,545 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."
107,Megamind,8,9 December 2011,Great Movie,"The movie is like a parody of Superman and Brainiac. Megamind being the Brainiac, and Metroman being Superman's caricature. I throughly enjoyed the movie. The concept is great. I didn't know that you could put a villain in center stage, and pull off a comedy spoof of super hero. But the whole thing works, and it's an amazing movie.All the characters that appears in this movie are some of the best ever created (maybe except for Titan). The comedy and the comic nature of the characters works hand in hand and makes one of the best comedic moments in animation history.It's one of the best animated movie to be made in recent years, and recommended for viewing."
108,Megamind,7,6 December 2011,Bring your little middle aged guy!,"Easily the most humorous moment of an often hilarious film involves a reference to Marlon Brando's performance as Jor-El, Superman's biological father in the movie of the same name. The parody is as potent as Superman's heat vision with Brando's mumbled, near-incoherent delivery, Conan O'Brien bouffant and ridiculously cheesy costume captured exactly. The interesting part of this involves realizing that the reference exceeds 30 years of age meaning to get it you likely need to be at least 40 years old. The other visual references include 1989's ""Say Anything"" and the 10 year old ""A Beautiful Mind"" suggesting a writing staff firmly in middle age. However, kids will enjoy the film for the rapid pacing and multi-dimensional action sequences and perhaps the best use of the 3D gimmick in this incarnation of its rediscovery. Will Ferrell, whose career can generously be described as hit or miss uses the exaggerated emotion in his voice-work as Megamind to excellent effect. While Patrick Warburton would have been a much better choice, Brad Pitt effectively nails the self-aggrandizing Metro Man by basically being himself. Also in the good but not great voice work casting category, Tina Fey has to be smart but sincere rather than sarcastic in the Lois Lane/Vicki Vale role called Roxanne Ritchie. Reese Witherspoon from ""Aliens vs. Monsters"" would have been a better choice. The excellent ""Aliens vs. Monsters"" represents the closest cinematic cousin to this film with less entertaining ""Despicable Me"" a close second. In short, this is not quite ""Monsters, Inc."" or ""The Incredibles"" but a very, very good time at the movies. You might also bring the kids (although they might wonder what you are laughing at)."
109,Megamind,7,5 December 2011,Megamind could very easily be just another 3D animation film. But it has enough originality to thoroughly entertain any audience!,"Megamind is the most polarized film I have seen. At times, it overflows with the kind of originality that I've always admired in Dreamworks films. Twists in the story, unique visuals and the way everything fits together could make this a 9/10. And then Dreamworks try to make the film more commercial, and the film suddenly loses 2 points! Within a single minute (watch it yourself, you'll agree) it deserves to stand alongside Toy Story 3 at the Oscars, but quickly seems eligible for a Razzie. Nonetheless, it exceeded my highest expectations. The voice cast is flawless, the music fitting and the proportion of the storyline ideal. As computer-animation improves every year, it becomes harder to tell what level of technical excellence a film possesses. In order to stand out, the visuals now have to be more original than ever before. Megamind has these originality's in small, frequent bursts. But these little bursts, without a doubt, make the film worth watching... 7/10"
110,Megamind,9,27 October 2011,Great,"I love this movie. It's funny, it's sweet, it's dramatic, it's clever and it has great pacing. The soundtrack is old school and classic. It does suffer from bad marketing (being released in the same year as Despicable Me, another superhero movie) but it's ten times lighter on its feet, and more clever--with the kind of SNL gags that I think Tina Fey had a hand in writing. It also has a real ~heart with its hapless hero. Some of the gags (an unshaven Music Man) really point to some great scriptwriting and animation, with inside jokes for parents that abound. I love the cute sidekick Minion, which is a v adorable and smart fish. And the invisible car effects and the deranged superhero-turned-villain mixes the lines of motivations and human nature and gives us a fun plot to hold on to. Great movie."
111,Megamind,,6 October 2011,"A film for everyone, Very enjoyable.","Not being a big animation guy, I went into this movie with an open mind; I expected a cute, fun, adventure of super heroes. With an all-star cast of voices I had some good expectations, and I was not let down. This movie was funny, it was sad; it was an absolute joy to watch. Although it was not your average Super-Hero movie, which was what I was expecting, it was much cleverer then that, and it even managed portray some great morals. You become very attached to the characters and very interested in the plot, it is very eye-catching and keeps you locked in till the very end.It is definitely a movie for the whole family, enjoyable for all. A great success."
112,Megamind,7,7 September 2011,Not despicable enough,"And by that I am referring to the other ""bad guy"" animation movie of 2010 -> Despicable me. But it might be a bit unfair to compare those too. It's not like they have the same story. Still while one found a unique way to tell the story, this here relies on the jokes alone. Not a bad thing, since they are pretty good in general. And the voice cast is doing a great job too.Kids will not mind either (no pun intended), or care if and how clever this is. It's good family fun with a little message. Predictable and caring almost completely on the main characters, this is a movie you can enjoy if you let it. I'm not sure about the 3-D though. Wasn't really necessary."
113,Megamind,7,4 September 2011,it didn't suck and I enjoyed it overall,"So I watched 2010's CGI cartoon flick ""megamind"". Well was it megagood, well for a kids flick I say it was good. Now as a flick just for adults it get's an ehh. However, if I had kids I could sit through this film and enjoy it which I did overall, and I think kids will love this movie. The animation is just standard fare here, nothing special but then again everything CGI to me at this point is wonderful, it just doesn't stand out here like it did in say ""rango"". The plot is interesting enough, two aliens crash on earth at the same time one destined to be a superhero and one destined to be a super villain, or perhaps not? The acting is solid and comes from some of the industries best Ferrel, Fay, Jonah Hill, David Cross, Stiller, and Pitt (hey my second review today with him). In fact, the character that Ferrel developed for this film was memorable, not Ron Burgundy memorable but good. It was interesting if I had to compare it to say ""the incredibles"" it is not in the same league, but it is good for a kid's flick. And I said most adults with the exception of my best friend who hates anything that isn't completely obscure should enjoy this ""popcorn"" flick."
114,Megamind,7,22 August 2011,Ferrell's comic talents push this into the positive,"Yes, I know, another stunt-cast animated feature that's sure to appeal to adults as well as to kids. But it's because of that supposed stunt casting that Megamind works, at least to some degree. Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, along with Brad Pitt, own their roles and imbue them with purpose and personality. The animation itself is standard, and the story is simply steady, but everyone involved appears to be having a blast.Megamind (Ferrell) is an evil mastermind whose plotting never pans out. He lives in Metro City (which he amusingly pronounces ""Metr-ocity,"" rhyming with ""atrocity""), which is defended by the saint-like Metroman (Pitt). Both hero and villain came to Earth from faraway planets but diverging destinies, and they've been fighting each other almost since their arrival. But every battle ends the same  Megamind is captured and jailed, and later he escapes and begins the feud anew. Until, that is, the day when he finally does defeat Metroman and thus loses his purpose in life. I'm sure we can all sort of relate to that.Other characters include a chirpy reporter named Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey), who's close to Metroman, and Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill), a cameraman who wants to be close to Roxanne. They make unlikely allies and adversaries, and not always with each other. They are also played to opposite degrees of success; Fey is as likable and adorable as always, but Hill is just flat as the doting cameraman. You'd think that would be right up his alley, but a change in character midway through doesn't feel sincere, and it's mostly because Hill himself lacks the poise and panache to pull it off effectively.Fey and Ferrell work very well together here, which shouldn't be too surprising. They're both comic talents, and they know their timing well. But there's this, too: there's a fine line between being funny and being hammy, and it's easy to jump over that line for most comic actors. Give them too much rope, they chew the scenery with it, to mix two completely unrelated metaphors. Each actor has a lot of fun with his or her character (it wouldn't surprise me if there had been some improv involved) without running amok with it. That helps the so-so script and plot devices. Also helping: David Cross as a fish-like alien who came to Earth with Megamind and has been his loyal sidekick ever since. He's named Minion for some reason. (Yes, I am kidding.)"
115,Megamind,,13 July 2011,"OK but too much plotting without enough heart and character and, frankly, not as funny or as child friendly as it should be","I'm sure the recent subpar offering of Cars 2 eased their pain, but Dreamworks must feel the pain more than anyone else when Pixar give us Wall-E, Up and the like while Dreamworks give us solid animations that always seem to get close but no cigar. Reminiscent of The Incredibles (albeit in superhero theme only), Megamind unfortunately joins the ranks of ""OK but no Pixar"" films in my mind as despite its obvious cost, it fails to deliver on its full potential. The plot sees us joining the perspective of supervillain Megamind who has time and time again been thwarted by his opposite number (Metroman) only to escape his jail and try again.The first most obvious problem with the film is the plotting  because there is loads of it. I'm not suggesting that it needed dumbing down but it felt like there was almost too many scenes where developments were occurring or things were being laid out and it seemed to push out other things. Specifically it pushed out time for character and heart because it lacked both of these. It is hard to describe perhaps but most of the Pixar movies seem to effortlessly bring a sense of engagement that makes you care about the characters in the film, with Megamind I was following the story but had no real investment in them. The second thing that was weak was the laughs because I was surprised by how few of them there were. I laughed enough times to justify the film as a comedy but again there seemed to be too much time where ""plotting"" was happening and not enough ""asides"" or comic aspects were put in  when they were they were funny but it was not often enough.The plotting and the nature of the plot also limited it in its appeal to all audiences and, ironically for a cartoon, it felt like younger viewers would be the ones left out in the cold. Not only does the time spent on ""things happening"" push out other stuff but the plot itself is fairly dark and it isn't particularly made accessible for younger ones. The death of characters is the best example of this but there are others that were key to what was going on but would either be difficult or go over the heads of children  even my girlfriend turned to me during the film and said ""this better have a happy ending"" (she is guarded about such things since I upset her with the animated film 9 recently).The film is naturally loaded with names when it comes to the cast and this tends to be the way with Dreamworks. In the lead roles I understand it but the star names go all the way down to smaller characters with barely a word to say. Ferrell and Fey cannot help but disappoint because, although their delivery is good, they are nowhere near as funny as they have been elsewhere, just not even close. Pitt seems an odd choice for a voice-only roll and indeed I can think of others who could have done a much better job with the rather hammy, clean-cut hero type. Cross on the other hand is more than welcome and has the delivery and the material with his funny support character, while Hill has character in his voice and does well also. I'm not sure though, for the value they bring, why they bothered Stiller, Simmons, Theroux and others to crowd the place with names.Overall Megamind is a decent enough film. The plot is good in idea but lacks heart and characters to bring it alive and engage, probably in part because it has too much going on and not enough time to let us care about it. Laughs are compromised too and, while funny, it is only sporadically too and all three of the children (below 10) I know who saw this were pretty bored by it. Decent stuff but yet again one cannot help but compare to Pixar, and things like the Incredibles that simply highlight the failings of things like Megamind."
116,Megamind,6,13 June 2011,Code: this is worth seeing,"If it's one thing I've learned the past few weeks, it's that Dreamworks isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. While Dreamworks films don't pack the emotional punch that nearly every Pixar film does, Dreamworks animated features tend to still be overflowing with fluid and colorful animation, solid casts, and more comedy in each film than Pixar seems to have. Megamind is a fantastic film to start with.While seeing this film on Blu-ray, you'll probably notice its intense colors right away. Sunsets are absorbing and vibrant, outer space is vast and strangely beautiful, and Metro City can probably pass for whatever big city is closest to you yet is a little overwhelming due to its size. Watching a ton of animated features back-to-back on Blu-ray demonstrates how vital Blu-ray is to the home video market. Once you watch an animated film in high definition, you'll more than likely never want to watch it in standard definition ever again.The old school soundtrack was strangely fitting. You probably wouldn't think of AC/DC, Guns 'N Roses, Michael Jackson, and Ozzy Osborne being on the soundtrack to an animated film like this, but they are. Michael Jackson's ""Bad"" really suits Megamind's personality like a glove and the same can be said for AC/DC's ""Back in Black."" The music just turned out to be a pleasant surprise that was not only a good soundtrack, but also became an illustrating characteristic of the animated super heroes and villains in the film.Most of the cast was pretty engaging. Will Ferrell's humor oozes from every pore of Megamind's big, blue head while Brad Pitt was the perfect choice for Metro Man. Pitt seems to be the type of Hollywood celebrity that is always in the tabloid headlines even when he's trying not to be and Metro Man has that same kind of deal. Fed up with the same, redundant routine, he comes up with a scheme to get himself out of the spotlight. It just seemed like a way for Pitt to live vicariously through an animated character. Jonah Hill is a rather bizarre choice for a villain on paper, especially when you first see Hal Stewart. But once he becomes Titan and he reveals his reasoning behind jumping to super villainy, he comes into his own and is easy to relate to. The only cast member I didn't really care for was Tina Fey. She played the damsel in distress gig well, but it didn't really feel like she made the character her own in any way and it was kind of disappointing. Lastly, David Cross as Minion was an unexpected surprise. Minion easily had some of the best lines in the film.Speaking of being easy to relate to, there's a story involving Megamind at the film's core that most people, kids or adults, will be able to associate childhood memories with. It gives a likable quality to what is otherwise a character you should initially hate at first. The film is also a bit more clever than expected. The entire story is basically centered on the what-if situation of your favorite superhero being defeated by their most famous arch rival. The way it all unfolds isn't quite as predictable as expected. It also includes references to things like Donkey Kong, which always gets positive marks from me.The humor is also something the film falls back on. Most of Megamind's actions, facial expressions, mispronunciations, and failed city domination attempts are amusing in some capacity. The highlight has to be most of the banter between Megamind and Minion. The chemistry between Ferrell and Cross is spot-on, as if they've actually known each other and been around each other through the thick and thin (mostly thin). Their ""code"" dialogue is so ridiculous that it's borderline hilarious since it's so simple yet pretty funny.Megamind is an animated film that is actually better with lowered expectations. The film is a bit smarter than it lets on, includes a cast that fits its roles to near perfection, and has animation that is both easy on the eyes and a joy to watch. Megamind is pretty much exactly what you look for in an animated film; it's entertaining to anyone of any age. Code: you should probably see it, if you haven't already."
117,Megamind,10,12 June 2011,"Great movie, not just for kids","This movie was amazing. I had very low expectations and have been avoiding seeing it for a while. I thought it looked like a silly little kids movie and had absolutely no interest. My boyfriend kept asking me to rent it, but I kept refusing. Finally, he just rented it and told me we were watching it. And I so glad we did watch it, it's so good. It's hilarious, and it's so nice to see a movie with a villain as three dimensional as Megamind. (By three dimensional, I mean the character had real depth, I'm not talking about the animation.) The acting was really good, too, it added a lot. It was so good that I kind of want to buy it and watch it again. That's really saying something."
118,Megamind,8,5 March 2011,"Not my favourite Dreamworks film, but smart and very entertaining","As far as Dreamworks movies go, I do prefer Prince of Egypt, Shrek and How to Train Your Dragon, but Megamind is one of the studio's better movies. While the film loses its way in the story just towards the end, and slackens in the pace a tad at that point, it is still smart and very entertaining. In general, the pace is fast and furious, while the story is original and exciting. I also enjoyed the voice acting, I don't care for Will Ferell but still thought he was brilliant as the zany and very lovable titular character, while Brad Pitt also entertains and Tina Fey is suitably sassy. The characters all add a lot to the movie, Megamind for me is one of the better title characters in a Dreamworks film.The film is also hilarious, the dialogue is funny and smart and the sight gags and references come by thick and fast. I particularly loved Ferell's Marlon Brando impression, one of the better laughs of the film. The music is memorable and energetic, with some nice song choices, while the animation is fantastic, very crisp and smooth with some amazing colours. All in all, this is not Dreamworks' best, but it is one of their better and funniest movies. I do recommend it, it is terrific fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
119,Megamind,8,19 February 2011,Can an evil genius turn good?  If you like Will Ferrell you will like this.  I liked it but not for reasons I expected. I say B+,"An evil genius becomes bored after defeating his nemesis. After being sent away from their home planet's Megamind (Ferrell) and Metro Man (Brad Pitt) develop a rivalry. When one of Megamind's plans actually work he is left to rule the city as he wishes. Soon after he becomes bored and comes up with an idea to create his own enemy. When he meets reporter Roxanne (Fey) he begins to re-think his life. I liked this movie but not for the reasons I expected too. It was funny, lot of adult stuff that made me laugh. A very good soundtrack (AC/DC, Guns & Roses, Ozzy) that fit the movie. But the reason I liked it was because of the story and message. Very touching and family friendly. Not as funny as recent cartoons like ""Despicapable Me"" or the ""Shrek"" series but very enjoyable and good fun for whole family. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - If my kids want to watch it, I would watch with them."
120,Megamind,9,8 February 2011,Hilarious,"Megamind is one of the funniest cartoons I have see in a very long time. It starts off as a typical superhero movie with a twist. The bad guy is actually the good guy and the created new hero turns out to be the bad guy. The dialog is hilarious, especially from Megamind and Minon. This is a movie for children and adults. The humor caters to older people, not in an inappropriate way though. Despicable Me has nothing on Megamind. I don't know how that movie was more popular than Megamind. In my opinion the movie is definitely worth seeing and buying on DVD when it comes out. This movie has everything action, humor, love, and a very happy ending."
121,Megamind,7,26 January 2011,Decent drama and spectacular action animation,"Yeah the movie doesn't pull any real surprises or THAT original, but overall I enjoyed a lot of aspects of this movie than disliked. I avoided this movie when it first came out in theaters cause of what some of the critics were saying about it, so I passed on it. And when I saw it at a dollar theater in 3D it was really worth watching, the action sequences and stuff constantly going on was a lot of fun to watch. The animation is also very well done from the facial expressions to the action. The movie starts off pretty well and got a bit dull later on, but overall it really is a enjoyable movie. It was pretty cool to see things in a villains point of view as well in a 3D animation, even if ""Despicable Me"" has done it as well. I didn't really like Jonah Hill in this cause the voice sounds just like Jonah Hill and thought it didn't fit that well, but every other voice actors and actresses did a very good job. It really is a enjoyable animation film for kids and adults and I recommend anyone that likes animation films to check it out. Speaking of ""Despicable Me"" I liked Minion slightly more than Minions.7.8/10"
122,Megamind,9,23 January 2011,Really good,"If you like watching animations, you really need watch this movie. I can clearly advice this movie without any doubt and stars like Brad Pitt, Will Ferrell dubbing the movie, and i can clearly say that they did some kind of awesome job because, dubbing is really good. Story of the movie is out of ordinary it can really make you surprise, it looks like a ordinary story but it is much more different from ordinary ones. Graphics are better than a average animation, musics of the film is well selected, they can really put you in mood. As a conclusion, this movie can give you more than what you want from a ordinary animation... you won't regret."
123,Megamind,7,11 January 2011,"An amusing, albeit unspectacular, diversion with a great voice cast.","I recently saw Dreamworks animation's Megamind, a film about a failed supervillain who discovers he makes a better good guy than bad guy. A plot like this hasn't been tackled at since... last Summer with the release of Despicable Me. And out of these two movies, Megamind is funnier, much more finely fleshed out, and just a better movie in general.Will Ferrell voices Megamind, the blue skinned, bulbous headed title supervillain. His evil schemes to take over Metro City are frequently foiled by his nemesis Metro Man (Voiced by Brad Pitt), a superhero who always saves the day, and the Lois Lane of their hometown, Roxanne Ritchi (Voiced by Tina Fey). But when Megamind accidentally defeats his nemesis, he falls into a slump. But decides to alter that by creating a new superhero out of a nerdy cameraman (Voiced by Jonah Hill), and in the guise of a museum curator, strikes up a relationship with Roxanne, all the while, his cold heart begins to warm The idea of taking the clichés of superhero movies, and turning them into quirky and unfamiliar territory is really nothing new, especially to those who've seen Pixar's The Incredibles, but what you'll get is a pleasantly surprising animated feature, albeit an unspectacular one. The characters tend to hop between emotions sporadically, and the story isn't all THAT inspired, (Plus the film's third act kind of drags) but the humor of the film, which ranges from witty one-liners and tickling sight gags, made me laugh a great many times, especially an homage to Marlon Brando's character from the Superman movies.The film also has a great voice cast, Ferrell, Pitt, Fey, and Hill are all given great material to work with, and their timing is effective, though one of the more interesting mentions is David Cross, who voices Megamind's scene stealing fish henchmen named Minion. The animation is slick, and dazzling, and the sound design by Ethan Van der Ryn and Erik Aadahl is some impressive craftsmanship.I can't quite say Megamind is a ""Three Star"" movie, because it just isn't. It doesn't completely nail down the tone it wants of itself, and to be honest, it might be a tad forgettable, but It's really enjoyable for what it is.I give Megamind **1/2 out of ****"
124,Megamind,8,6 January 2011,Fabulous Evil Fun,"""Megamind"" is one of the better animated movies to have made it out of 2010, end of story. It is right up there with ""How to Train Your Dragon"".The story told in ""Megamind"" is one that everyone can relate to, both children and adults, and that makes it so much fun. Because there is something in this story for everybody. The classic tale of good vs. evil, but with a funny twist. And you can do nothing but love the plans and schemes Megamind comes up with and the way he carries them out. Total genius at work here.As for the animated style of the movie, well I loved it. It had this really cool cartoonish touch to it, though it was superbly and beautifully drawn at the same time. The colors were plenty and splendid and the animation itself was amazing.The cast of voices in the movie was amazing as well, with great names like Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, Justin Cross, Ben Stiller, and more. Everyone here did a really good job with voicing out the characters on the screen, with so much passion and soul. It worked so good.And the characters in the movie were lovable, though some were quite stereotypical. But oddly enough, I found that to be quite a fun approach to the archetypal superhero genre. So it worked out well. And my favorite character was Minion, he rocked!This animated movie is wholesome entertainment and fun for the entire family. Kids will love it, adults will love it, heck, even your pets will love it. This movie is a definite keeper. And I think it is also the type of movie that you will take out and watch again at a later time, because it just has that much appeal and watch-value.And it was a refreshing touch to actually have the 'badguy' of the movie turn out to be the light of the day. Thumbs up for ""Megamind"", way, way up!"
125,Megamind,7,2 January 2011,"comedy, 3D, bad boy turns good","Megamind is the movie that gave me the most surprises this year. Its story is a combination of The Incredibles and Despicable Me, though the 3D effect is a bit redundant.What could soothe me most apart from watching an innocent boy growing bad and then turning good again? At first I felt indignant for Megamind as the chance of being adopted by a decent family was snatched by Metro Man, and how he was treated in school saddened my heart too. The choice he was forced to make seemed understandable: if I cannot be the boy with the best behavior, then why not just be the bad boy?In this film,Megamind is not only a villain, but a human being with heart and feelings. His eyes can speak: how helpless and melancholy he is when Roxanne turned back on him at a rainy night. He was also childish in the way that he got really worried when he found he had no rival to fight with, and therefore decided to extract Metro Man's DNA in order to make a new hero. Obviously Megaman didn't have the evil plan that villains mostly have, say either rule the city or destroy it once and for all. Arguably it was Roxanne and the love inside him that saved his soul.The movie is full of surprises and light jokes, just thinking about what happened at Metro Man's little secret retreat resort and the comedic performance of Minion. The songs played out of the gigantic cassette player succeeded in making audience laugh out of breath. I empathized with Megamind so much that after the movie, the thought came to my mind that if it were a sad ending, I would not in the mood for anything joyous in the upcoming several days."
126,Megamind,7,18 December 2010,Beauty And The Beast,"It is a scenario which we see in numerous films, the underdog falls in love with the beautiful woman, proves himself as the hero but it doesn't matter because she falls in love with who he is underneath. We have seen this a lot, but not so much in animated films. It is not often we see the ugly animated character get the gorgeous girl, but you do in ""Megamind""! The film does fit into the animation trend as of late of the bad guy becoming the good guy, but gives it the twist with this unsung hero getting the girl, which will do good things for peoples self esteem. Even if you are blue with a massive forehead and alien looking you can still get the one you love by being yourself! Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) has never been good at anything besides being bad. The means of his existence is to fight with Metro Man (Brad Pitt), but when he actually defeats Metro Man, he is completely confused by his new found dominance and lost for what to do next. He decides to create a new super hero for the town, Titan (Jonah Hill) so he will have someone to fight. One thing he didn't count on was failing in love with Titan's crush, news reporter Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey) and bringing out more bad in Titan than Megamind ever had.""Megamind"" is a great, fun family film to watch. It is not just a film for children as their are many themes there for adults as well, such as the romance theme which children will of course be unable to relate to. The graphics are amazing in the film and it is one film which is worth seeing in 3D while it is in the cinemas. It is well written and has a lot of great laughs throughout. However, the ending won't be a surprise to anyone and will be something most people will see coming from the very beginning.""Megamind"" has some big names which have contributed their vocal talents to the film. The one thing that is obvious with this is that with each of the cast members, they do not seem to go the extra mile with their characters voices. Each of them, bar perhaps Will Ferrell , plays the type of character they would normally play in a film which they would physically appear in and it is easy to pick who's voice is which. For example, Brad Pitt plays the good looking hero, Tina Fey plays the businesswoman who has too little time for her personal life and Jonah Hill plays the overweight nerd who can't be taken seriously. Will Ferrell does definitely do a good job at providing the voice of Megamind and, unlike the others, you can often forget that it is Ferrell's voice you are hearing.If you are taking your children to see ""Megamind"", you will probably find that it is more a boys movie than a girls movie. Children aside, it is a film that all ages will enjoy. The graphics are great to watch and the script is witty and funny. Overall, besides the romance, it isn't the most original film to come out in the last few years and it is quite predictable, but definitely good for a laugh."
127,Megamind,9,15 December 2010,Really funny!,I thought that Megamind wasn't going to be a good movie but I was wrong.It was a lot better than I thought.It had several actors in it that I really like.Megamind (played by Will Ferrell)is a really funny character who is the movies villain and despite everything he does he cannot get anywhere.My favorite characters are Metro Man and Megamind.It was a really funny movie and is well worth the money to see it in 3D.The 3D effects are great.It has a great soundtrack.I am going to see this in 2D next time I go to the movies.I want a second serving.Best animated movie of 2010.It had a great plot with a mix of comedy and action.9/10 is my rating
128,Megamind,9,15 December 2010,"Do you have to be a super hero to be a ""super"" hero?","First off I want to say that this movie is aimed more for adults, since I doubt too many people under a certain age will get the jokes related to the original Superman movies, Marlon Brando doing his Godfather voice, and how the music linked in perfectly with what was going on. When ""Bad To the Bone"" started to play I about fell on the floor I was laughing so hard. This is what made the movie an absolute hoot and very enjoyable: not only the script but the excellent use of music throughout the movie. Even the slower, more This Is Who I Am scenes worked because the music made it work even better. I loved the rivalry between Megamind and Metro Man, and the ""friction"" between Megamind and Roxanne (he's had a crush on her from Day One), as it somehow made me think of some scenes from coming-of-age films, most notably some scenes from Diary of a Wimpy Kid. This is not to say that kids will not enjoy the movie, but a lot of the jokes will go right over their little heads. All of the adults in the theater were laughing their heads off, and I saw a few kids looking around at us, probably wondering what was so darn funny."
129,Megamind,8,10 December 2010,Megamind,"Note: The original text is in Portuguese. I use the Google Translator to translate. I revised the text and I think there are no problems.DreamWorks Animation has reached its peak this year with How to Train Your Dragon. A sublime animation, visually stunning, with a touching story and not lose anything to rival Pixar. Now comes Megamind, that despite not having the same quality of How to Train Your Dragon, has a great history and is extremely fun.Directed by Tom MacGrath (Madagascar 1 and 2) and written by Alan J. Schoolcraft & Brent Simons, debuting as writers, the history begins with two aliens being sent to Earth. One becomes the town hero, Metro Man. The other chooses evil a becomes the villain: Megamind. After countless battles and failures, Megamind finally defeat Metro Man and takes city power. And then the villain comes to a crisis. After all, without someone to deal with, and having already turned the city inside out, what else a villain has to do?The film has fun references to Superman, from its origin to the Jor-El, Superman's father, played by Marlon Brando in Superman - The Movie 1978.In technical aspects, while not having as many details and textures how How to Train Your Dragon, the film nonetheless has a beautiful sight, with an excellent animation and expressive characters.The soundtrack is great. Ozzy Osbourne, George Thorogood, AC / DC and Guns'n'Roses are part of the selection and make the sequences even more exciting.Megamind let sentimentality aside and focus on fun, and at no time sounds forced. It is obvious that there is no comparison with Toy Story 3 - Pixar animation also launched this year - or the aforementioned How to Train Your Dragon, but Megamind fulfills its proposal and is one more hit of the studio."
130,Megamind,8,25 November 2010,A philosophical Nature VS Nurture debate masquerading as a hilarious kids' movie.,"Oh, this is the stuff! What a tremendously enjoyable movie MEGAMIND turned out to be. Sure, the origin story is profoundly unlikely and the denouement is positively unbelievable, but who the hell cares? This movie is fun, fun, fun. And Will Ferrell, as the misunderstood supervillain at its heart, is funny, funny, funny.The star-studded MEGAMIND tells the story of a criminal mastermind who finally defeats his archnemesis, Metro Man (defender of Metro City -- or, as Megamind styles it, Metrocity) and therefore takes over the running of the town they call home. Of course, there is a reporter in the mix, one Roxanne Ritchi, who is an obsession with our supposed villain, full of moxie and earnestness and voiced ably by Tina Fey. Jonah Hill plays her infatuated and infantile camera man, Hal, with consummate blabbering skill, and his transformation into a spurned sadist by the movie's end is delivered with great relish. David Cross is superlative as Megamind's fish-like minion, the aptly-named Minion, and Brad Pitt is perfectly serviceable as Metro Man.But the star here is the petulant and accident-prone ramblings of Ferrell as Megamind. His mispronunciations are unendingly amusing, his megalomania is kind of adorable, and his unbridled arrogance is somehow charmingly endearing. He's a lot like KIM POSSIBLE's Dr. Drakken, actually (who is also, I would point out, blue), but is a far more sympathetic character. I mean, he's mindboggling brilliant, but doesn't seem to understand what a ""code"" for something is. That is SO CUTE. The writing here is top notch, and it is mostly the dialogue he is given that makes this movie really pop, but there can be no doubt that Ferrell brings an instantly likable tone to proceedings that makes MEGAMIND a treat from the very outset.How tragic, that Ferrell's best performance since Ron Burgundy should come in a movie in which he doesn't even make an appearance.The underlying theme here is one of Nature vs. Nurture, as one of those Here's the Moral, Kids voice over wrap ups at the end makes all too clear. Redemption is possible, everyone makes mistakes, don't judge a book by its cover, we should all follow our bliss, yadda yadda yadda. Whatever, dude. This year's DESPICABLE ME also sang that song, and it's hardly the first; the anti-hero is certainly nothing new in genre. From The Punisher to Riddick to Dr. Horrible (a debt to whom Megamind surely owes a thing or two; Metro Man, certainly, is at least a spiritual heir to Captain Hammer, with perhaps a little Roger Ramjet thrown in), the trope has been very well explored. What MEGAMIND does is to elevate that concept into the kind of What Next? scenario superhero stories rarely address: what happens when there is no bad guy left to battle anymore? And what if the bad guy wins? What exactly makes a bad guy? And if bad guys don't get the girl, can being a good guy maybe get you some action? (In cartoons, the answer to that is apparently -- and perhaps a little misleadingly -- yes.) Produced by Ben Stiller, this movie also features his voice in a brief cameo as misanthrope Bernard, whose guise Megamind takes on as he woos the oblivious Roxanne. (At least it's not just him with glasses on; and we never do discover if Metro Man has an alter ego. That's a refreshing change!) Some of the movie's most enjoyable moments come about as we watch our blue-skilled supervillain begin to live his own life instead of try to control everyone else's although, none of that can hold a candle to Minion's Oscar-worthy comedy death scene.I have to say, I've not been previously too enamored of Dreamworks' other animated features. SHARK TALE, MADAGASCAR, KUNG FU PANDA, the recent HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON I didn't hate any of them, but neither did they really win my heart. (And SHREK: blech.) But with this one, I am suddenly a convert to the SKG fold, and can only hope they hold true to form and decide to put out a sequel.Called MINION."
131,Megamind,8,24 November 2010,Turning superhero clichés on their heads,"This is one of DreamWorks' best animated movies, largely because it makes a point of turning clichés on their heads, and then following the twists through to fruition.Plus: Nicely paced - it never stalls and never zips ahead too fast to follow. The parts that were slow on action carried enough thought and depth to keep them satisfying.Minus: As usual, DreamWorks just insists on cluttering a nice fantasy milieu with American (or at least Western) culture-specific (former Top 10 rock) music. This is probably my biggest pet peeve about their films: If you're going to make up a fantasy world, bloody do the whole job - don't cheap-out and go for the easy/lazy references as a substitute for real original contextual humor. The audience is smarter than that. (That said, this was the biggest minus for me, and at least Mr. Blue Sky was an apt choice in context.) Plus: The voice-work was great. I'm bad at matching voices to the stars, but even so, none of these sounded distractingly familiar. That made it easy to just believe the characters - and sympathize with them. And the dialog is tight, nicely concise and not flaccidly jokey - MegaMind drills right down to his real existential crisis succinctly and clearly. (And no Eddie Murphy improvisation.) Plus: The 3D effects were effective and not overbearing.Plus: Megamind himself doesn't have any real superhuman powers - no especially superhuman strength, no ability to fly, no x-ray vision - and his only personal asset of maybe super-intelligence is flawed enough (pronunciation being a real stumbling block, and later there's the musical taste issue) to be interesting and to still allow tension between his ambitions and his opponents. But, his gadgets and devices are cool and clever, and make for some nice plot twists - for example, his ""wristwatch"" that allows him to take the appearance of anyone he's had the chance to ""record"" not only gives him a great power of disguise/deceit, but also gets him into a position to learn and seeds his personal growth. And, the de-hydration ray gets rid of inconveniences minor and major in a temporary way, allowing for them to rehydrate/reappear later in surprising ways; this device also plays a key part in possibly the cleverest MegaMind trick in the film. It's all part of the presentation, which is after all the difference between villains and SUPER villains.Plus: Minion is an unusual and interesting minion; MetroMan (do I detect a tongue-in-cheek hint that he's sort of Metro-sexualMan? with the impeccably coiffed hair, perfect teeth and manicure? Certainly, when it's revealed that he faked his own demise to get away from the routine and the pressure, he's slacked off in the appropriate ways, letting his stubble grow and dressing a bit down) is just odd enough as a superhero to defy predictability - what other superhero has just up and quit the game? Sure, others have had crises of purpose, but not taken it in the direction MetroMan did.Plus: The main thing that won me over is that the movie really drew me in and kept me wanting to know what would happen next - and made me care about the characters enough to root for them, even if the suspense wasn't especially deep - I never really thought things wouldn't turn out happy in the end."
132,Megamind,1,6 November 2010,im having convolutions of disgust,"this is probably the worst movie i've seen in years! who wrote this piece of (passionate- profanity)HT! if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the best parts because the movie is nothing like the trailers. it just goes to show mega talents do not make a mega flick. jonah hill, was terrible, will was horrible, and brad? he had 5 lines. the crazy fish side kick was in the beginning and end. the plot was about a silly romance, which didn't make the adults enjoy the flick more nor get to the kids. like they care if two grown-ups kiss and become dumb and dumber? i read a review earlier about how it was comparable to stabbing your eyes out with a dull spoon; i have to agree. my kids liked the blue guy, so i suppose that is the level of success dreamworks is basing this on."
133,Megamind,5,10 January 2011,"Another animated movie on the lines of ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs', ""Bolt"" and ""Despicable Me"" which are Colorful but Not Funny AtAll!","MEGAMIND  CATCH IT (B-) MegaMind is another pointless animation, which is colorful and bright but not funny at all. Animated movies have become biggest earners over the years and somehow it gave some studios the reason to make an Animation movie, whether it's necessary or not. MegaMind's story is taken from all superhero movies all together and there is nothing new ATALL. The romance between MegaMind & Roxanne Ritchie was very typical and dramatic for Animation genre. The only think kept me engaging was the bright & Colorful Animation that's all. The voice talents of Will Farrel, Tina Fey, Brad Pitt, David Cross and Jonah Hill are rightly used. Though, Brad Pitt didn't have much scoop. Overall, it's another animated movie on the lines of ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs', ""Bolt"" and ""Despicable Me"" which are charming & Colorful but Not Funny AtAll!"
134,Megamind,5,8 January 2011,Old cliché wrapped in A new layer,"It's like all of a sudden, big companies ran out of new idea's. The  great boss screams ""bring me some new one's"". And then because  writers ran out of them and obviously they're not pixars or miyazaki or something... They try to convert the old stories into something that at least sounds new!  Funny lovely villains who turn to be good I mean!  After ""Igor"" and ""despicable me"" this is the third one in the series and we should wait for at least dozen of them till it's get boring again and the big boss screams. Better than ""igor"" but not as good as ""despicable me"". Milion light years Far from creativity in storytelling....  Good technical animating stuff though."
135,Megamind,10,15 November 2010,the best animated film so far of 2010,the best animated film of 2010 so far is megamind... It was awesome.. I really can say that because i love animated films.. Megaminds character was the best since he is a genius and went to prison and got of out it.... I loved Roxanne i though she was amazing and her news show that she did in this movie... Bernard was a cool average person... This was a funny movie and i will see it again on DVD. I give it 10 stars because it was awesome and amazing... I loved Will farrell in this movie he was awesome as megamind.. Metro man was cool since he was a good superhero... Tighten was interesting to see and to see how he acts to people.. this movie was amazing.............. the story line was amazing too................ i can't wait to get this movie on DVD.... I might have to see it in 3d........ i saw it in 2D and may see it again in 3D.......................... this movie is perfect for the whole family... I think everyone should see it...... I loved this movie..
136,Megamind,6,8 November 2010,It's...okay,"Megamind is actually kind of a neat idea, and might even be taken as a contemplation on the nature of good and evil (""can there BE evil without good?""), but it's a victim of its own timidity.The great cast is pretty much wasted here. Will Farrell shows uncharacteristic restraint in the way he voices Megamind, and while Tina Fey, David Cross, and Jonah Hill are all very funny people, the script doesn't give any of them much to work with.The funniest scene is probably the one where Fey's Roxanne has been kidnapped by Megamind, who eagerly anticipates Metroman's rescue effort. Except Megamind has done this so many times that Roxanne is not only not afraid, she's actually bored, and challenges Megamind to be more original. It's cute. The trouble is, this is an early scene, and nothing in the rest of the movie really gets back to this level. The other BIG problem is that the best gags from even THIS scene were used in promos for the movie.Yes, there's an irresistible urge to draw comparisons. I spent much of my time watching this movie lamenting on how good Pixar's The Incredibles is. And, yes, a comparison is valid, considering that the story in The Incredibles covers a lot of the same territory. I felt remarkably similar feelings about Sony's Despicable Me, too, but part way through that movie at least took an odd turn into improbable family comedy and actually went somewhere.Perhaps most unfortunately, I'd just seen How To Train Your Dragon earlier that day on DVD, and Megamind seemed phoned-in by comparison.Dreamworks can do better, and has, many times."
137,Megamind,10,26 October 2010,"In simple terms, its entertaining","From the makers of KungFu Panda and How to train your dragon, comes a new movie called 'Megamind', which you can get skeptic about a lot of things, but you cannot deny that its entertaining. I got to see this in a screening few days back. The movie is full of explosions, nice special effects, enormous scale of the world, well mixed soundtracks, and fantastic presentation. Every character is likable and sympathetic. The animation quality is unquestionable and it has some nice jokes. It is fast paced, although I personally would have preferred if they made the movie a bit longer; There is a lot of margin for drama and emotional content with the story they have and also since DWA is really putting good depth in their movies lately, I was expecting the same, but they preferred to keep it short.As I have always seen, one thing DWA movies have in common... they are entertaining."
138,Megamind,6,7 November 2010,"Brad Pitt's Voice Work Excellent, but Overall Just Satisfactory","The posters and previews did not really attract me to watch this movie. However my sons made me see it with them, so I did. I am wary about Dreamworks animation projects. I was just hoping that it would be a pleasant surprise, like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or ""Kung Fu Panda"" were before this.It all starts with a Superman scenario when two babies were sent via rockets to Earth, when their planets were destroyed. One was raised in the lap of luxury and grew up to be the superhero, Metro Man. The other was raised in a prison, ostracized all his life for his big head and blue color, and grew up to be the super-villain, Megamind. As fate would have it, they became arch-nemeses. One day, one of Megamind's hare-brained schemes to destroy Metro Man actually succeeds. However, after he experiences his ""success,"" he finds his life empty without someone to fight against.Regarding the artwork, the characters (with no exception) were really very unattractive and unappealing, as they were drawn. I see this as a problem with all Dreamworks projects like ""Dragon"", ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", and ""Shark's Tale"". The character Hal/Titan is the worst and most annoying of all. Their Metro City backdrops and special animated effects though were very well-done.As for the voices, the best one belonged to Brad Pitt as Metro Man. It was noble yet cheesy, very on point. Will Ferrell sounded like he had a good time with Megamind, but it was just OK. Tina Fey's voice as the feisty reporter Roxanne did not really reflect her funny personality. These two could have been done just as good by any other voice talent.Overall, this movie was satisfactory, not spectacular. As you can deduce from the short synopsis, this movie is not exactly for kids. There were stretches in the middle when my kids were restless. The success of the jokes were erratic. The script was surprisingly quite adult in its analysis of good and evil, even contemplative at times. I appreciated this and I liked the twists and turns that the story took. I am not sure though if the kids actually got what the movie was really all about behind the silly action sequences."
139,Megamind,2,7 November 2010,More needless 3d crap,"Barely enjoyable for Brad Pitt's voice alone. The movie is mindless entertainment to teach the kids that being bad is taught and that good lies in the even the most evil of people. OMG, I just gave away the movie...good....no go see something that doesn't have Will Ferrell's annoying voice in it. Jonah Hill is tolerable, Tina Fey is Tina Fey (funny cause they wrote her that way), and the rest of the cast is forgettable.If you want to dump the kids off at a movie...choose one better than this. It's sad that it will make money, but that's because 3D is the it thing this year...too bad 3D doesn't always mean that you have a story worthy of the extra expense....this one is not worth 3Dollars....get it at the red box in a few weeks. Then it will be worth watching in the privacy of your own home, when you can forward too the good parts, which are about 30 minutes before the final credits role!"
140,Megamind,9,3 March 2014,I Was Very Surprised,"I was never going to watch Megamind, because it did not look very original or interesting from viewing the commercials for it. Plus, Megamind is a cartoon movie and I believed I had seen enough of the cartoon variety of movies or as it were Disney style movies. One night while on the road, I had nothing better to do, so I clicked on the TV and Megamind was on. After a little time of watching it, (without giving the plot away) I began to see where the movie plot might go, and my eyes opened pretty wide, I thought no, noway! You Dreamworks people did not go in this direction with the plot of a Cartoon! No cartoon and certainly no Disney movie dwelves into these philosophical concepts!Then the plot moved on and I realized, OH YEAH THEY DID! AND THEY DID IT RIGHT! The plot of the story (which you can read here in IMDb or in Wikipedia) has a strong philosophical basis and a powerful ending, some good comedy and well...other things to make it worth viewing (more for adults than children but both can enjoy it).The movie plot (and I'll try not to give too much away) indicates that sometimes life is about not living with the choices that life deals you, but rather choosing the life you want to deal with. Spoilers (well sort of a spoiler if you understand this) Megamind is dealt a bad hand at the beginning of the movie, but really has something good inside of him. When Megamind succeeds at being the worst Megamind can be, Megamind destroys his rival/nemisis and that is when Megamind discovers a part of himself that cares for someone (Roxanne), and at that point Megamind begins to find what he was meant to be and surprisingly, and unbenounced (at that point) to the audience, so does his dead nemisis/rival. Megamind, who then gets his heart broken by Roxanne, tries to continue his old life, but finds his plans, (for someone calling himself Tighten) somehow, as with everything Megamind has done before, have gone awry, and then because Megamind feels something for someone, he must now suddenly switch sides, and suddenly the status that Megamind never seemed to have wanted, but Megamind was always meant for, is thrusted upon him, and to Megamind's surprise, unlike anything Megamind has done before, he succeeds at something he never seemed to want to do, that Megamind was always against, but this time Megamind does succeed because he feels something for someone. Megamind Arises and Succeeds To The Status, That Megamind Was Always Against But Probably Secretly Wished For. CHEERSor perhaps as Megamind might say itCHARRES(You know like he said Melankly for melancholy or Ollo for Hello or EsChool for School or mitrausity for Metro City)This may seem cryptic to someone who has not seen the movie, so go ahead and see it. It's a great movie."
141,Megamind,7,7 February 2011,Surprisingly Cute,"I really really really hate Will Ferrell. Usually just the fact that he is in a movie is enough to turn me off from the film as a whole.It's a good thing I didn't actually know he was in this when I bought the ticket.All in all, I was expecting to kill an hour and half with a light-hearted ""kid's movie"", which would have been fine, but instead I got a well made comedy for all ages.A good family movie, has multiple levels of humor, simple sight gags for the kids, snappy banter and one-liners for teenagers, and maybe not ""sophisticated"", but more nuanced jokes for adults; things that a kid would miss. This film uses different characters and their interactions to make that work.For the very young, the highlight of the film will be the interactions between Megamind (Ferrell) and his sidekick Minion (David Cross) as well as Megamind's frequent mispronunciations of common words; ""School"" is ""Shoool"", ""Spider"" is ""Speeee-yder"", and ""Metro City"" is made to rhyme with ""attrocity"". Teenagers will likely find the awkward humor of Hal/Tighten (Jonah Hill) their own cup of tea, largely as satirical reflection of the modern, (sub)urban teenager's view of the world. And adults are more likely to see the most humor in the way the plot is both an homage and gentle parody of comic book staples like the bad guy always losing, and their seemingly endless supply of elaborate weapons and traps (they come from a surplus store in Romania), as well as the developing love story between the Lois Lane-esque Roxanne Ritchi (Tima Fey) and Megamind, turning the romantic element of many classic superheroes on its head.The CGI, while not quite Pixar quality is good and crisp. The soundtrack is a fantastic mix of the best of classic rock (Ozzy Osbourne and AC/DC always make a movie better). The jokes fly quickly without becoming obnoxious, and it is one of the really few movies marketed toward kids, but actually equally (if not more so) enjoyable to adults"
142,Megamind,6,13 January 2011,Decent film but seems to try too hard,"Megamind is a decent/average film in my opinion. Its pretty straight forward and gets to its plot right away. The story is predictable, but also seemed a little force and awkward at time. The animation is good and so are the effects. For a super villain, I thought Megamind was rather weak and not very convincing. He wasn't very evil at all, just insane and very sensitive. His character should have been done better, they should have made his character a little more likable yet bad-ass at the same time. Though Will Ferrell's voice work was spot-on, good job on his part. The other character's I didn't really care for, specifically Hal/Titan. His purpose wasn't very good, and I found him annoying. Metro Man was okay but he should have been more interesting- he seemed boring to me.Though, the biggest disappointment character in the film was definitely Roxanne. I know she was designed to be a regular person, but that doesn't mean they had to design her to look so uninteresting and plain. I was amazed with how expressive Megamind's face was, yet Roxanne's character looked so bland. Tina Fey's voice work added nothing to the character. Roxanne was supposedly to be a very pretty and likable character since all the lead males were tying to get her attention, yet I felt like her character was the weakest link and not exciting.I didn't see why Megamind, and Titan were really fighting for her- it didn't seem worth it. The ending of the film (the final showdown) was pretty good, but they should have made it less predictable. Overall, Megamind is a decent film but I was expecting more."
143,Megamind,10,12 January 2011,Code: Underrated,"I'm a big lover but also critic of animated movies, so much that I even work in the industry.So when I first saw trailers for this movie my response was a drawn out ""Sigh... No thanks..."". Nothing compelled me to watch it what so ever.But I was today shocked to find out that this movie is so excellent, so well written and so well directed that I'd dare say it beats somewhat 50% of my beloved Pixar movies.Not once did I grind my teeth because of plot holes, not once did a joke fall flat, not once was I bored. And that fact, more than the quality of the visuals, is what makes a movie great.To keep it simple, please support this underrated movie I had tons of fun watching it, and I'm sure you will too. Let's hope Dreamworks will make more movies like this."
144,Megamind,8,30 December 2010,Great Film But Not Really For Kids,"As the father of a 10 year-old girl, I have had to sit through some pretty dire kids' movies over the years. Prior to ""Megamind"", the most recent ones were ""Despicable Me"" and ""Toy Story 3"", the former good but sentimental and poorly paced, the latter a predictable by-the-numbers instalment in the franchise.I wasn't expecting much from ""Megamind"" and knew nothing about it, not even having seen a trailer but I was very pleasantly surprised. There was excellent characterisation and voice acting, spot-on animation and a great soundtrack. However, the plot was the high point for me - genuinely clever and original, avoiding the normal Hollywood ending. In the hands of Pixar, for example, Metro Man would come back to save the day but in ""Megamind"", there is a much more interesting ending.The design is also excellent, with influences from DC comics and a 50s sci-fi retro feel to Megamind's guns and battle suit. I see that Guillermo del Torro is credited with creative input and it shows.The characters are some of the most convincing that I have seen in an animated film. Will Ferrell plays Megamind with a talent that belies his previous dire offerings in American ""comedies"", Tina Fey is a great Roxanne and Brad Pitt hams it up enjoyably as Metro Man.The only observation that I would make is that many of the jokes are going to be over the heads of kids. I know that film-makers like to insert in-jokes and references that only adults will understand in order to keep their interest but there are too many in this film, including Megamind's incarnation as Marlon Brando's portrayal of Superman's father and Megamind's existential introspection.However, it is undoubtedly the best children's film that I have seen over the past few years so if you don't have a child, try and borrow one and go and see this."
145,Megamind,8,4 December 2010,Fun and frantic sendup of cartoon villains & heroes: SUPERMAN meets THE INCREDIBLES,"MEGAMIND (2010) *** (Voices of: Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, David Cross, Justin Theroux, Ben Stiller, JK Simmons) Fun and frenetic send-up of cartoon superheroes & villains with titular baddie (voiced with gonzo glee by Ferrell), a blue-skinned, chrome-domed alien from another universe attempting to make sense of his well-being when his arch nemesis Metro Man (Pitt) is finally vanquished allowing the supervillain his day of glory (or is it?) Archly humorous thanks to a well thought of screenplay by Alan J. Schoolcraft & Brent Simons) and imaginative verve by director Tom McGrath) suggesting a blend of ""Superman"" and ""The Incredibles"" ; the 3-D by the way is passable but not entirely necessary thanks to the vibrant production design by the animators."
146,Megamind,1,26 March 2011,Dreamworks Worst.,I bought Megamind at WAL-MART and I must say that I didn't like it. I personally think that it's the worst animated movie that Dreamworks has made. The plot was kinda weird the villain wants to take over the world but then turns good after falling in love with a girl. The characters weren't very funny and the animation wasn't great. All in all I believe that this is just a rip off of The Incredibles and I don't think that Dreamworks should of ever made this movie! It's definitely their worst! It's nowhere as good as Shrek or Madagascar. So if you're a fan of Dreamworks I suggest that you don't see this movie because you won't like it and you'll just be wasting your money. Thumbs down for me.
147,Megamind,,28 November 2010,Bearable....with a big gaping hole in the story,"I sat through it 'cause I was thinking it was going to get better, but alas, no. Not too funny, some guffaw moments, overall just bearable. It seemed some of the dialogue was ad-libbed and kept in, but they weren't that funny (I know it wasn't, but just sayin'). Like the thing with his ""baby seal"" boots and the kidnapping ""spider"" scene.My spoiler question and the big, gaping hole in their storyline is (unless I missed something): How was MagaMind able to make an infusion for his SuperPower injection using the bones from the cape off a FAKE skeleton! It wasn't Metro Man's!!Thanks."
148,Megamind,7,1 November 2010,Almost Like The Incredibles,"Megamind is what I would call an 'almost-there' movie. It is almost the  epic animation that was ""The Incredibles"", almost as hilarious as the  ""Madagascar"" films and it almost makes you forget you are watching a  3-D movie. When you add up these 'almost points', the score is a family  flick that is both fun and funny to watch, whether in 3-D or not.  Here, the 3-D effects are not obtrusive and after a while, you kind of  get comfortable and forget you are wearing the 3-D glasses. Which, I  must say, is a big plus for the 3-D gimmick. Yes, it is still a gimmick  to make you pay more for the ticket.  Megamind (Will Ferrell) is the super-villain who is trying to conquer  Metro City in every imaginable way possible. However, every time he  tries, he is thwarted by the egoistic superhero Metro Man (Brad Pitt).  Then one day, Megamind succeeds in getting rid of Metro Man! Instead of  being happy, Megamind realizes that achieving his life's ambition is  the worst thing that ever happened to him. He decides that the only way  out of his rut is to create a new hero opponent called Titan, who  promises to be bigger, better and stronger than Metro Man ever was.  Pretty quickly Titan (Jonah Hill) starts to think it's much more fun to  be a villain than a good guy.  Now, if after getting rid of Metro Man, Megamind feels lost without an  arch-rival, he still has his Muse. It is in the form of the feisty TV  newscaster Roxanne Ritchi, played with a huge dose of feminist charm by  Tina Fey. In fact, Roxanne is the heroine and the agent of change for  both Megamind and her cameraman Hal (Jonah Hill again) - although not  necessary for good.  Megamind is about villainy - and if it is lonely at the top, it is also  lonely at the bottom of the moral pool. Writers Alan J. Schoolcraft and  Brent Simons have penned many interesting characters, some of whom  change personality at the turn of a watch bezel. Heroes are boring, and  Metro Man is so full of himself that he is clownish and boring. Not so  Megamind, though. His encounters with Roxanne sparkle with chemistry  and they keep the movie going, both for the kids and adults. And  director Tom McGrath, who also provides the voice for a prison guard,  keeps the pace fast and the tone goofy. It won't blow your mind but it  will tickle your funny bone."
149,Megamind,6,25 September 2011,"I made you a hero, you did the fool thing ALL BY YOURSELF!","Supervillain Farrell seeks purpose after fulfilling his only focus in life defeating his nemesis, superhero Pitt. The bad guy is painted as the protagonist and the good guy as the antagonist in this interesting little outing from Pixar, but the laughs are few and far between--and some of those are complete misses. Most disappointing is the lack of energy it imparts for an animated action-packed family film. You'd figure there'd be something a little more philosophically humble when the person you're supposed to be rooting for is driven to chaos, no matter how light-hearted or comedic especially when children are the target audience! No doubt this was just a paycheck for the A-list actors.**½ (out of four)"
150,Megamind,7,11 December 2010,Megamind,"Despicable Me was a good alternative computer animated superhero movie, and this was next one to be released, I was a little dubious but I gave it a chance, from director Tom McGrath (Madagascar, Madagascar 2). Basically blue bulbous-headed extraterrestrial Megamind (Will Ferrell) grew up in the world of the bad guys, unable to do anything good, while Metro Man (Brad Pitt) with his super powers grew up to be good, but Megamind made sure if he was going to be bad, he would be the baddest. So Metro City has to put up with Megamind and his schemes to try and take over the city, and Metro Man comes along to save the day, but one day everything changes. After Metro Man claimed his weakness was copper, and an explosion occurs at the observation tower, a skeleton in his costume is thrown out, and it looks like the super villain has finally defeated his enemy. Now with the power to take over the city, Megamind allows everyone to go on like normal until he decides what to do next, but he slowly realises there is no fun to be had and no reason to exist without a hero to stop him. So Megamind decides to put things back to the way they were by inventing his own super hero from the DNA of Metro Man, and he unintentionally passes the powers onto dweeb news cameraman Hal Stewart (Jonah Hill). As he trains the new hero with is newfound super powers, Megamind disguises himself as Bernard (Ben Stiller), friend of new reporter Roxanne Ritchie (Tina Fey), and they continue dating to the point where Megamind is in love with her. Eventually she does find out who she has really been dating, and she doesn't want to see the super villain again, and worse is to come when Hal, aka Tighten has decided, with Roxanne refusing him too, that he is bored of being a hero, and it is more fun to be the villain. So now Megamind, with the help of Roxanne must find a way to stop Tighten before the city is destroyed, and they may have hope when they find out that Metro Man isn't dead after all. In the end, after some explosive fighting and chase sequences, Metro Man does help save the day, but returns to being some regular guy, Tighten goes to jail, and Megamind is praised as the new city hero, with Roxanne by his side. Also starring David Cross as Minion, Justin Theroux as Megamind's Father, Jessica Schulte as Megamind's Mother, Tom McGrath as Lord Scott, Emily Nordwind as Lady Scott and Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons as Warden. The voices are all fine, the references and spoofs of Christopher Reeve's Superman, including Ferrell's impression of Marlon Brando, is amusing, the 3D element isn't too obvious, and there are some good action scenes, it is a likable animated comedy adventure. Very good!"
151,Megamind,6,5 December 2010,Megamind: 6/10,"With an easy blend of comedy and action, Megamind doesn't stand out as one of the animation of the year. But it does however, convince its audience that they will like it coming out of the theater. It is not as slick as The Incredibles and the 3D scenes aren't amazing as How to Train Your Dragon, but you'll enjoy it. Megamind is about a supervillain and a superhero battling since they were born. Megamind, a blue guy with a big head, spends his whole life trying to kill Metroman (Brad Pitt). While the city hates him, he's convince that when he kills Metroman, the citizens will obey him. But when he finally ""killed"" Metroman, he found out that his life no longer has a purpose. He has nothing else to do rather than stealing stuff from the city. At this point, I think the movie is trying to get out the message that you have to live life with a purpose, or something like that. But in the end, we know Metroman is alive and Megamind gets locked up again. (There is a whole other subplot that's I'm not going to get in.) Will Ferrell's voice as Megamind is irreplaceable but Tina Fey and Brad Pitt were just unnecessary. Jonah Hill was way better than the two combined but that was because he was one of the big character. They tried to do a lot of stuff in 3D that weren't suppose to work in 3D. But at least they tried. 3-dimensional effects isn't that hard, but I felt like it took them forever in this film and get those effects going. Megamind isn't bad, it is great to say the least. But it lies between the it's-so-bad-that-it's-good type of movie."
152,Megamind,10,9 November 2010,amazing!,"This movie was amazing! the story line was amazing.. everything was amazing!. I love you Megamind! I wish i had the DVD already to watch it over and over again About to go see it in 3-d next. I have no clue why they are rating this as a 7/10. It is worth way more then a 10 even. I cant wait to get out of college in 2 years to work for them. I love Megamind. As a animation student, this really showed a lot of principles of animation. Each Char had his or her own personality that you cant help to fall in love with and feel with them. The story of a mega evil bad super villein turning good in the wake of the death of a super hero is so original and really shines a light on the ""what if"" (I shout all of this. but yo cant see it since it wont let me caps*"
153,Megamind,10,7 November 2010,Well polished,"A deep comedy is hard to make... but the story is mature, the jokes are funny, the voice acting is outstanding, and the 3D is state of the art.Megamind's countenance bears all the hallmarks of the stereotypical villain, and he does some pretty wicked things, yet we all root for him. That is no small feat for DreamWorks. Because the story is so well thought out and the characters so complete, they keep you caring about it all as the story takes its course. A lot is squeezed in, and I found myself wishing for more when it was over. This is a movie for grown-ups, or at least those with an IQ over 80.Hatas gon hate, the movie is flawless."
154,Megamind,4,21 February 2014,A few funny moments don't really make up for its lack of inspiration,"The story and the comedy here are just a bit too much like ""The Incredibles"" -- this time it's Will Ferrell as a supervillain who's forced by the death of his rival (Brad Pitt) to first create, and ultimately, become, a superhero. I didn't see it in 3D, but on a flat screen the visual effects were interesting to look at, but not very inspiring or transporting. There's very little novelty in its fantasy world, just a sort of standard superhero, art-deco, Superman spoof type of thing.""Space Dad"" who looks and talks like Brando in the 1970s Salkind Brothers' version of ""Superman"" is a joke that's probably going to go over most viewer's heads, and really isn't all that funny for the geeks and old folks who remember. This is typical of the sort of third-generation feeling of the movie. We felt we've already seen these types of ironic superhero revisionist things before, and the film never stretches itself to provide anything but a farce of the very tired and worn conventions of superhero films.There are a few funny scenes, and it should divert children."
155,Megamind,6,8 November 2010,Will Farrell's Personal Avatar,"The release of ""Megamind"" on the first Friday in November marks the beginning of the winter blockbuster season and shows that Will Farrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, David Cross and Jonah Hill know how to draw a crowd to the box office. ""Megamind"" is the latest DreamWorks animation story that incorporates different aspects from Superman. The basic plot concerns the epic rivalry that began when a blue super villain alien named Megamind (Will Farrell) and his arch nemesis superhero Metro Man (Brad Pitt) were babies. They both were saved from the destruction of their respective planets by small spacecrafts destined for earth. Their rivalry continued as they both grew up living very different separate lives fighting periodically through the years. All of these battles resulted in the defeat of Megamind up until one day that changed both of their lives forever and Megamind's perspective of good versus evil.The character Megamind is an exact replica of what Will Farrell would look like if James Cameron made him into an Avatar. With this being said Will Farrell is funnier than ever and is able to carry his humor over from his movies aimed at an older audience and transform it into humor appropriate for younger kids. The film also has a special guest appearance from the film's producer Ben Stiller as the voice of the character Bernard. Tina Fey (""SNL"", ""Date Night"") is also in the film playing the voice of news reporter Roxanne Ritchi who is involved in a very interesting love affair with Stiller's character Bernard. David Cross's and Jonah Hill's characters join the party as well playing the characters of Minion and Hal respectively in very different and dynamic performances. Despite the voices of these actors, the best part of the film is the entertainment value that Will Farrell brings to the table.Brad Pitt's character Metro Man is also animated to a T, depicting exactly what Pitt would look like as an animated superhero. However, Pitt is almost nonexistent in the film after the opening ten-minutes of the movie. Where did he go? The disappearance of Pitt hurts the film and complicates the story line that should have been simple and straightforward. The film suffers from animated movieitis stemming from plot holes, discontinuities and lack of substance. Characters that should not have been very important to the film are developed into main characters, while making the film ""Pittless."" Therefore, the movie as a whole does not succeed in creating a compelling story.Overall, the film is a very entertaining, fun family film that everyone can enjoy. However, you can wait for DVD to see it. Also, don't expect a film in the same league as ""Toy Story 3"" or ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" instead expect a film that relies solely on the humor of Will Farrell as he succeeds in stealing the spotlight on the animated screen once again as he did in the 2006 film ""Curious George."""
156,Megamind,5,13 April 2011,Will Ferrel turns his Mugatu voice into more undeserved $.,"Megamind deals with a pair of arch-enemies that have been pitted against each other since birth. Megamind (Ferrell) is blue and wiry with a water dispenser for a head and a little goatee. Metroman (Brad Pitt) is your muscular Dorito shaped All American type  brave, handsome and well spoken and willing to do anything to maintain the peace and safety in the city of Metro City.In their respective youths they each were forced into different pathways, Metroman found a more privileged and loving upbringing, and Megamind unfortunately found himself in different, less favourable surroundings, that of prison since toddlerhood. After a decade or so of being rivals with Metroman and failing, Megamind decided that rather than growing up an outcast he should embrace his circumstances and go all out as a bad boy makes sense I guess.(In this vein Megamind has unavoidable similarities to the recently released Despicable Me, both featured wannabe supervillains planning global conquest and oddly enough both having sidekicks named Minion! In this film Minion is a talking fish who drives an invisible car and uses an automated body to get around. Given my opening statement it should surprise no-one that I liked Despicable Me more, and given the option would pick up that DVD every time in future.) On and on for years the two battle, Megamind hell bent on implementing his various nefarious  but this is PG so not so scaryious  plans, and Metroman forever there to foil them. A frequent bargaining chip in such battles is cute n spunky young TV reporter  and presumed love interest of Metroman  Roxanne, something that infuriates her young cameraman Hal (Jonah Hill: playing a cartoon character looking surprisingly like Jonah Hill).Megamind and Hal similarly resent Metroman, Megamind as he continually thwarts his plans for global domination, and Hal as he presumably thwarts Hal's plans for Roxanne domination.At the conclusion of one of many Good Vs Evil battles Evil finally triumphs to the surprise and shock of everyone not least of which is Megamind himself. After the briefest of possible ""Yay we won!"" montages featuring both the villains, bystanders and innocent civilian reactions to this unexpected development Megamind rapidly comes to the conclusion that getting exactly what you crave all the time is no fun apparently  sounds pretty good to me. It seems that without his archrival and nemesis Metroman that being the undisputed ruler of all he surveys has lost a bit of fizz.Without the ying to his yang, his ""you complete me"", his ""you had me at Hello""  OK I went one too far but you get the picture  Megamind lacks a sense of purpose.Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww.With this in (mega)mind a plot is devised to simply create a new nemesis from scratch, so that Megamind and co can have someone to battle against. To exact his new diabolical scheme Megamind must through necessity don various disguises to move undetected through Metrocity. It is while in mufti that he runs into both Roxanne and Hal (separately), due to Megamind's not being 7 foot tall and blue they are none the wiser at who they are conversing with. As they interact and get to know each other better past biases and hatreds are forgotten and friendships are unwittingly forged.Of course as this is a movie Megamind's carefully laid plans are always doomed to inevitable backfire, leading to further conflict and unexpected developments that amaze and astound us all  but not really.I can't go further without flubbing what little plot exists, suffice to say that it was reasonably straightforward and that the twists were seen coming from a mile away. The voice acting was as mentioned simply horribly lazy, Ferrell was the only one who even had a crack at creating a different voice for the role, only as it was one from his limited repertoire it grew annoying swiftly.Pop culture references and catchy songs frame the more memorable or hooky scenes, and precious little of the remainder was either memorable or amusing. I normally find at least one character even in the most lazy animated feature to like  in the pointless and plain bad Monsters Vs Aliens it was Bob, in Despicable Me it was the Minions  but here I found nothing and no-one.The shame here is that because Megamind and Despicable Me are so similar were released so close together that comparison are inevitable it means that we must unavoidably play the two films against each other, and that scrutiny basically shows just how derivative and unnecessary BOTH films actually are.Final Rating  5.5 / 10. Animated comedies featuring big name stars. Welcome to the successor of the B horror film. It doesn't matter if you're lazy, boring or just plain bad  until people stop going to every single one in mindless drones the quality will inevitably get worse and worse  leading to films like this.And what is it with the ""everyone dances over the end credits"" thing? It isn't bad, just reeks of ""same""."
157,Megamind,9,7 November 2010,Megamind kicks Despicable's butt,"Having a 2nd supervillain themed animation film in the same year might have been thought of as overkill and ill-timed. Overall, though, that this movie, Megamind, came after Despicable Me, was apt because I would have simply been disappointed in Despicable Me if I saw Megamind first.Megamind has all the right combinations, a decent plot, a couple of twists, an over the top villain who eventually evolves into a likable guy, couple of good supporting characters, an homage to Marlon Brando, a couple of FB-esquire pokes of fun at Superman (including a Lois and a Jimmy Olsen), humor (lots of witty ones, too), and a couple of nice action/fight scenes.Most of all, it has a lot of heart. For a guy named Megamind, he sure shows some heart in this film that you can't just help but root for the guy (even if he was evil by design or by fate). Didn't recognize the voice talents of Ferrel, Fey and Mr. Pitt, though I could tell that Titan had to voice of actor/comedian Jonah Hill, so at least I can watch again the movie and see some snippets (if ever) of the real actor's or actors' speaking habits coming out in this movie.I'm not sure if this will be a classic, but it sure will be something I can keep watching when it comes out in DVD a few months from now. Good follow up from Dreamworks after How To Train Your Dragon earlier this year. Keep up the great works your Animation division is churning out.ADDENDUM - saw this in 3D. Like Despicable me, you may not necessarily be missing out if you watch it in 3D so watch according to your preference."
158,Megamind,3,11 November 2010,By far the worst animated movie I ever seen in 2010...,"since Madeline: Lost in Paris. While I didn't want to watch Legends of the Guardians or Shrek Forever After, I found this to be extremely unimaginative.First of all, it has brief references off of other movies. The whole thing made me want to watch Monsters vs. Aliens and I'd never thought there was going to be a redemption in this. It copied off a little musical piece from Up (2009). It copies off of 'Cloudy With A Chance of meatballs"" somewhat and all in all, it copies off of anime such as Full Moon o Sagashite. Where aliens/spirits turn into humans... WAIT! Aliens versus Spirits? O.K., that could be the weirdest thing I ever saw. This movie is a copycat.I've been wanting to see this movie for months now and I asked my mom to borrow her money to check out this movie and I nearly walked out of the theater during half of the movie. When you see the part where Megamind releases Roxanne, walk out of the theater and ask for a refund. It isn't worth it. Not even twenty minutes could make people get in touch with the movie.I came home and told my mom that I hated it and started writing on sidewalks ""Megamind Sucks"" like a mischievous boy.Please avoid this movie at all costs and wait until it comes out on Blu-ray and DVD. And I also forgot that this movie probably literally copied off of Despicable Me while it was in progress (Bad turns into Good). Anyways, please do not watch this even if I do write on your sidewalks. Ignore it! And watch Jackass instead,"
159,Megamind,3,6 April 2011,Ugh!!!!!!!!!!,"My expectations were up to high. I was in a hotel room with the rest of my family. There were little kids involved so the movie selected Megamind. I laughed once or twice. I was bored half to death. It was more or less a film about an outcast looking for friendship.Brad Pitt's name was put up high on the list of actors to attract you but he as at the most 10 minuets of screen time.Will Ferreal gave it his best but he seemed out of place to me. Kids will love it because to them any Dream Works film is amazing (Maybe not one like Saving Private Ryan). But really if you only have kids like 6 or 7, this is good for them. If you've got kids in that age group and older kids like 8 or 9 then only the young kids will enjoy it. Pick one that will appeal to all ages."
160,Megamind,5,21 November 2010,"Another cartoon.  How about a ""real"" movie?","This movie is just OK--but my general dissatisfaction has little to do with the plot or characters--but more on that in the last paragraph.The plot is about two babies from a planet that develops creatures with strength and powers beyond that of humans. Two of these creatures are jettisoned from the planet, and by pure random chance of where their spacecrafts land on earth, the Pitt character (Metro-Man) ends up in the home of a loving family, and the Ferrell character (Megamind) ends up in a prison for the mentally insane. This charts their future course in predictable ways--Metro Man becomes the hero of Metro City, while Megamind, after release from prison--the terms of the release and his upbringing at the ""S Chool"" (as humorously pronounced by Ferrell)--are never fully explained.Anyway, so it's made clear early on that Megamind isn't truly evil but is in it for the sport of it, while Metroman is a bit more full of himself as the hero than than, say, mild-mannered Clark Kent. As part of the plot a third character joins the mix as another super-human hero after a major battle between Megamind and Metroman. This adds a bit of complexity to a story that really has no business being complex--cartoon or not. It also adds dead time to the movie, as this new character isn't really very interesting. Anyway, in the romantic mix for all these characters is Tina Fey, who is the funniest part of the movie--she is a plus for any movie but as explained below--this movie's mediocrity has little to do with the talent.So without spoiling anything, we have an ending meant to satisfy us and bring closure to the characters. But this movie, and increasingly *every* animated movie lately, does not satisfy me--and it's not the plot or characters that fall short. It's that I'm tired of CGI animation. I don't care how ""good"" the quality is, how ""realistic"" it is--it's not real and frankly it's creepy. If I'm going to see a cartoon I'd prefer a real, hand-drawn cartoon. This CGI, in my opinion, is just wrong. It's too 'real' to be a cartoon but so completely unreal that I never get a true feeling for the characters--no matter how well-voiced or well-written they are. In the early days ""Toy Story"" was popular but I think the popularity had more to do with the novelty of the Pixar animation--the 'wow' factor. It's ho-hum now--even though the resolution, shading, texture, etc has improved. Ironically the more all of that technology improves the creepier these movies get. I could go on and on about how the newer Star Wars ""movies"" with Jar-Jar, et al., were soul-less bores, but I'll close here--and hope that those who agree will let their feelings be known to Hollywood. I'll take a real, filmed movie any time over this animation."
161,Megamind,7,12 November 2010,"Not for ""Innocent Children""","The movie is funny and exciting, but strangely I fell asleep during it.I don't write these reviews, and I don't feel so strongly about you knowing my opinion of this movie to write one.But it has a line that should not be in any movie marketed towards children. I don't care if it is rated PG, so is The Incredibles and it has no lines I hope get taken out of future releases of it.Megamind has such a line. And if it isn't taken out of the movie, I will not suggest parents take their kids to see it.American society has agreed upon certain mythical creations to be portrayed as fact, and it is up to the children to move from believing to disbelieving when they are ready. It is not up to Dreamworks or Jonah Hill to decide it is time to educated my child, and the millions who see this movie. Had I read the reviews I am finding now I would not have taken my son to see this movie. And if Dreamworks does not take out the line ""{This toothy character} isn't real, and {that mascot for Jesus' resurrection holiday} isn't real, and the queen of England isn't real,"" I won't rent the movie, I won't it, I won't recommend it. However, if my son takes this opportunity to say, ""Daddy, is there really no . .."" I'll be happy to boycott many more Dreamworks productions.That's all."
162,Megamind,7,7 April 2016,Very Fun!,"Will Ferrell is as goofy as usual in his role as Megamind. This is a great family movie. It is silly enough for kids to really love it, and it is entertaining enough for adults to enjoy. There are a couple great jokes in the movie, and a good amount of silliness.There are not many animated movies like this anymore. It is enjoyable for anyone who sees it. That is very rare indeed with modern animated films. Will Ferrell is great in this movie because he is very silly, but not dirty like many of his adult films. I personally think Will Ferrell is funnier when he does not get so raunchy, so he nailed it in this movie. Overall, a wonderful family movie that everyone is sure to enjoy."
163,Megamind,7,5 January 2016,Quite different from other superhero animations,"I saw this the other day, with my two kids and wife at the cinema, this is a great movie, even though it's quite different from other superhero animations, you can't help compare it to them. As such a comparison goes, this has some great new stuff, but it is lacking some of the heroism that is often seen in these kind of movies.It's a really fun movie for the kids, but animation today tend to have something for the grownups as well, this does have a few things, but it is mostly for the kids. I don't mean this in a bad sense, that's good that it's main focus is on the kids and can really entertain them.It is entertaining all the way through, a bit chaotic at times and seems to jump or leave out some scenes, but all-in-all it works very well."
164,Megamind,10,17 May 2014,"A unsuccessful villain defeats his enemy, but then realizes he gets bored without him...","This has to be one of the best animated movies EVER!!! A complete surprise this was, since I thought it would be Amazing, but it turned out to be even more incredible than I imagined! This movie is SUPER! In every way possible... It's funnier than ANY adult movie, FULL of action(not violent of course) and has some kind of lesson to it! Well, OK, I'm a HUGE animation fan, but Mega mind really didn't seize to AMAZE me...It has Super(using the word AGAIN, sorry!) funny characters with so much sass to them! Especially the main character! Will Ferrell out did himself! I recommend this movie to ALL audiences. Any one with a bit of a sense for humor would die over this movie!! Such a unique storyline AND COMPLETELY unpredictable... DO SEE THIS MOVIE!"
165,Megamind,10,31 March 2014,Simply genius,"SPOILER Ahhh..Megamind! I love Megamind, it's probably my favorite animated movie. It has already been said so eloquently by others how marvelous this movie is so all I am going to say is Kudos to the writers! The script is genius, I love all the good/bad talking between Megamind and Minion, 'do i look bad?', 'you don't know what's good for bad' simply Genius, no other word! The music too was great, the songs chosen for each scene is top notch. But the storyline is really world class, throughout the movie, one learns to care for Megamind and get attached to him. He is so sweet in his attempt to be the baddie, that it puts a smile on one's face. For those who haven't watched it yet, i don't think there are many but just in case, go watch it, it's a superb movie full of sweetness, hilarity and great values."
166,Megamind,9,5 January 2014,Beyond Good & Evil (Chapter 1 Adapted),"This cartoon engages the Will to Truth, which continues to tempt Megamind to many a hazardous enterprises and continues to bring him into engagement with seemingly singular escapades with the famous Metro Man of which all citizens of Metrocity have hitherto spoken with respect.What questions has Megamind not laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! The story of his existence is a long one yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced when we meet our protagonist in the the bad guy place. Is it any wonder if we begin with distrust, impatience, and turn away from this maniacal pseudo-genius? We may compare him with the Sphinx who will teach us at last to ask questions? Who is it really that puts questions to us here? What really is this ""Megamind"" before us?In fact we make a an hour-long discovery of this Megaminduntil at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. From the beginning we inquired and were told about the value of this Megamind. Granted that we want Metro Man: why not rather Megamind? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of Metro Man is presented to usor is it the viewer who presented the self before the problem? Which of us is the Metro Man here? Which the Megamind?Megamind, the movie seems to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and risk raising it. For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no risk. Enjoy!"
167,Megamind,7,10 June 2013,cute,"I saw a commercial for Megamind just after seeing Despicable Me and was quite confused; wait, are they making the same movie twice in the same year? It was unfortunate for Megamind, which was both not as funny as Despicable Me and came out later, creating a been-there-done-that impression.But putting aside that other supervillain movie, Megamind is pretty good. It's an amusing little film with good performances, particularly from Tina Fey and David Cross, some nice action, and a charming but implausible premise. While it would have been better to have had a little more space between them, there is room in this world for both movies."
168,Megamind,6,10 May 2013,A good spin on the superhero movies but Tangled FTW,"Megamind is a 2010 animated fantasy sci-fi comedy that pokes fun of Superman mostly and tells the story about an alien named Megamind voiced by Will Ferrell from Bewitched,who is the world's most evil villain who sets to defeat Metro Man voiced by Brad Pitt who happened to be in Sinbad Legend Of The Seven Seas who is the hero in the movie. Problems arise from Megamind as he falls in love with News Reporter Roxanne Hart voiced by 30 Rock star Tina Fey who clearly can't stand Megamind. But when Metro Man fakes his own death its up to Megamind to create a new villain but of course the plan backfires as Roxanne's chief assistant Hal voiced by Superbad's Jonah Hill becomes the villain instead of the hero and comes up with a name called Titan,its up to Megamind to save the day.So what do I like about this movie well for starters the humor is great along with the animation which is brilliant,but I guess my main problem with this film is the story,its sometimes very complicated to follow as we see Megamind falling from out of the sky in the beginning and I thought hey what is Megamind falling from his death for and what really happened to his parents and why is Metro Man heading to Earth with Megamind is he an alien like him too posing as a human I dunno its all choppy for me and I also found it very slow pacing too,I mean if you take Tangled that movie had such a fast pacing and it was over before I could spot anything in that film,but Tangled was better in my opinion for the story here like I said for Megamind was too slow and I really didn't care about Roxanne either and her relationship with Megamind it just doesn't work for me these two.But having said that it was an enjoyable romp but its definitely not in my top 10 favourite animated movies of all time."
169,Megamind,8,3 December 2011,"Blue-skinned, Oz-like Conehead is a non-stop charmer despite presence of mean-spirited Titan antagonist","Despite its rather conventional ending, 'Megamind' proves to be a highly entertaining twist on the superhero genre. Satirizing the origin of the Superman comics stories, we're introduced to two different superheros, Megamind and Metroman, as they arrive on earth from separate dying planets, in space capsules at the same time. Metroman's flight is smooth but Megamind's is anything butcrashing into various meteors and debris like an out of control bumper car. A flashback chronicles how Metroman ends up with an all-American family but Megamind plops down in middle of the Metro City prison where he's raised by inmates to be a 'villain'. But Megamind is actually more like The Wizard of Oz than a hardened criminalhis dark side can best be described as a mischievous youthful offender, capable of rehabilitation.If Megamind's delinquent mindset is his Achilles heel, Metroman is also trapped by his celebrity status. An Adonis with a chiseled jaw, Metroman flings babies in the air with aplomb as police officer shoot their guns as part of a blind celebratory approbation. Megamind and Metroman periodically battle one another for the affection of love object Roxanne (Roxie) Ritchie, a perky TV newscaster voiced by the talented Tina Fey. Roxie isn't impressed by their clumsy attempts to win her affections. She's bored after being kidnapped by Megamind and after being brought to his lair bluntly tells Megamind that your ""plan never works"". When Metroman arrives and engages Megamind in yet another physical confrontation that always ends in a stalemate, Roxie wittily queries: ""Girls, girls, you're both pretty. Can I go home now?"" 'Megamind' breaks into its second act when Metroman fakes his own death and the blue-skinned Conehead finds himself experiencing an 'existential crisis'. Without Metroman, Megamind laments, ""it's just too easy now"". In his 'despair', Megamind's delinquency in Metro City (or 'Metrocity' as he puts it) multiplies exponentially. Megamind steals all the artwork in the city's museums and places them inside his own office inside City Hall. He throws currency all over the streets as if it's confetti, but none of the mischief makes him happy. Finally, using an idea he misappropriates from Roxie, he decides to create his own superhero so he can once again find some meaning in his existence. NY Times critic Stephen Holden puts it most succinctly: ""The movie's central joke  that good and evil are meaningless unless both exist in continual opposition  is unusually sophisticated for an animated movie.""Megamind's new opponent turns out to be Roxie's cameraman, Hal, a geek who expects women to flock to him without mustering any effort to charm them. Before being injected with Megamind's new preparation that alters his DNA, Hal is a harmless nerd who reminds me of a caricature of Bill Murray's cameraman in the classic comedy, 'Groundhog Day'.There are tons of funny moments in 'Megamind'. Here a few that come to mind: when Megamind tells Roxie they're making renovations at the Metroman Museum (""we're having the walls and ceilings removed""); when Megamind throws the dynamite at his mini-bots and apologizes (""Daddy's sorry""); Minion's expression when he leaves Megamind (stifling his tears and then displaying a stiff upper lip); Titan's lame comment after Roxie rejects him (""Wow, our first fight""); the reaction of the man with the baby in the restaurant when Bernard is transformed back to Megamind (his eyes are wide open in disbelief!).Despite all the good stuff, 'Megamind' loses its way when introducing 'Titan', a character that diminishes the comic tone of the film's second half. Although Megamind was always up to mischief , he never had murderous intentions (remember how surprised he was, when he thought he had killed Metroman). Before Megamind's misguided intervention, Hal was like many other geeky guys who simply hadn't discovered the right way to charm women. Remember it was Roxanne herself who confronted Titan and reminded him that he was not such a bad guy after all, BEFORE he was transformed. This is what Roxanne says to Titan right before he ties her up on the tower: ""I want to talk to the real Hal...I want to talk to the guy who liked being a cameraman, and eating dip and being a nerd and being not as scary as the Titan Hal."" In Roxanne's view, before the injection, Hal may have been ""self-absorbed"" and perhaps a little ""selfish"", but certainly not in her eyes, a creepy stalker. He had his ""issues"" just like Megamind and Metroman, but they were all multi-dimensional characters. Only Titan is a one-note character. He has no charm and doesn't really fit in the Megamind universe due to his unpleasant attitude and non-stop nastiness. When he actually tries to kill Roxanne by lobbing the bus at her, the movie suddenly turns in a rather sour, unfunny direction. I realize that once he was injected, all of Hal's bad points were magnified to the point where he became a psychopath. But why was that? Why couldn't Hal remain the goofy nerd, even after Megamind injected him? Everything else in the movie was FUN, but once Titan turned into who he was, things weren't much fun anymore. In essence, there needed to be some kind of explanation in the script as to WHY Titan became a psychopath. Perhaps he encountered some Kryptonite type substance that made him act that way or perhaps Minion used the wrong DNA when the formula was being prepared. Some may believe on the other hand that Hal was innately bad and Titan merely represented a magnification of his evil nature. Whatever the case, the Titan character was so unlikeable that the film's denouement turned into the standard comic book 'good triumphs over evil' narrative.Why belabor Megamind's obvious shortcomings? There's enough excellent, clever stuff here to keep the critical film goer eminently satisfied. 'Megamind' is without a doubt, worth more than just one viewing. Check it out!"
170,Megamind,,29 September 2011,I'm afraid Megamind does not save the day.,"Now it is time for DreamWorks to have a stab at a cartoon hero, and after Pixar's brilliant The Incredibles this film can only be doomed to failure. I am pleased to announce that although nowhere near as good as The Incredibles it is still half decent.Megamind is an alien, sent down to Earth as a baby due to his planet being destroyed. Along with Megamind another baby is sent down to Earth from an opposing planet. Megamind lands in a prison, being raised by criminals and the other baby lives the life of luxury in a manor house. As they grow up they become rivals with Megamind adopting the villain persona and the other adopting the hero, Metro Man.The two battle out with Metro Man always coming out on top, until Megamind finally succeeds in killing him. After this he then realises that life is no good without a hero to fight, so decides to create one for his own, Titan. Although Titan doesn't work out according to plan and due to jealousy becomes evil, leaving Megamind to become the hero and save the day.The story does work and there are several hints to outside influences such as Superman, the vulnerable reporter, and Frankenstein, the creation of a monster. The film is very much a super hero in reverse and at times does employ the tired tactics but seeing as this is a children's film at heart, it was never going to go any deeper. The premise is good and, although recently Despicable Me took a similar premise, seems original but I think a lot of that is done through the voice work provided by the actors.Ferrell is very good as the voice of Megamind, delivering his typical comedic role which I'm sure most was ad-libbed. Jonah Hill is fantastic as Titan, really bringing the character out into a three dimensional world and Fey is fine as the reporter, Roxanne Ritchie but the star of them all is David Cross playing Megamind's sidekick Minion. The character has some of the best lines and considering he is a fish in a helmet attached to a robot, his facial expressions are brilliant.The film employs a lot of comedy but unfortunately I never really found myself in hysterics. Many of the gags used have been played in the trailer and others were more aimed at kids. Considering other brilliant animated films like Shrek also appealed to adults perhaps a superhero film could have done to. This film does not live up to its predecessors from DreamWorks and Pixar, so if you are going to the cinema to see another Toy Story than you will be disappointed. I know you shouldn't judge movies on others but with so many fantastic animated films out there than we can't help but. The problem with this movie is it doesn't live up to the hype of any other animated film at this time, which is a shame due to the great cast. It just feels like something is missing from this film as I could only connect towards the end. The end scenes are great but the ones leading up to it just seem a little dull at times and it's hard to empathise with Megamind until the end, so he will never be a remembered cartoon character like Shrek. There you go comparing again.The film is worth a watch for some light hearted entertainment and I think kids would love it but for me it was just a mediocre cartoon alongside some brilliant animated films."
171,Megamind,,14 July 2011,"Okay, but doesn't really stand out in a crowded genre.","""Sorry! Sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback.""Megamind is a mixed bag in almost every way. The idea of a super-villain turned superhero would have been novel, if the superior and similar Despicable Me wouldn't have been released around the same. The movie tries it's best with abundant slapstick humor, but it's only sporadically funny. Some of the character designs are great (say what you will, but Roxanne is one hot computer animated character), but others are lane and not memorable (Titan, or ""Tighten"", I'm looking squarely at you). The settings and background as a whole are clean, bright, and colorful, but also very generic and uninteresting. The voice cast is full of big names, but they get very little opportunity to shine. Megamind is by no means a bad movie, but with how competitive the genre of family computer animated movies has gotten in the last few years, it doesn't do nearly enough to stand out. It was decent enough to give a rental and I quite enjoyed some parts of it, but seeing it once will probably be enough for most people over the age of seven or eight."
172,Megamind,8,8 June 2011,MegaMind - The Funniest villain ever,"An underachiever his whole life, when realizes that he is not good at doing anything noble, also comprehends that he is pretty darn good at being ""BAD""!!!, thus came into existence ""MEGAMIND"", which according to me is ""the"" funniest villain ever. MEGAMIND and his best friend MINION, did remind me of the duo of ""SULLY and MIKE"" from Monsters Inc., but the bone-tickling comedy does make sure that the sometimes goofy ""super- baddie"" wins hands down. The scene where MM corrects TITAN by explaining that the difference between a villain and a super-villain is PRESENTAATIIOOOOONNN!!!! , was the best of the lot for me.Amazing animation by Dreamworks yet again. Brad Pitt is too good as METROMAN, but Ferrell steals the show for me. Snappy scenes and witty dialogs make it a must watch for all age groups. Do take out some time for this one, coz you will definitely leave with a smile on your face and a thought in your mind"
173,Megamind,5,3 March 2011,Scripted Hollywood checklist pleasure; nothing out of the ordinary,"This movie felt like it was scripted with a ""hollywood checklist"" and if you had read what you are going to see (supervillain turns superhero) you knew the rest of the story: The supposedly surprising personal makeover of the four main characters, the main character pushing away his best friend for love, reunited in battle, the dead yet undead hero, blablabla. There is virtually not a single surprise in the storyline! It's a dead movie, even though the animation technology is supreme and there are a couple of laughing moments. But I wouldn't have watched it had I just known that. My girlfriend left for the toilet after 50 minutes and didn't come back since she'd met some friends outside. I should have joined her!"
174,Megamind,5,24 February 2011,The Vidiot Reviews...,"MegamindThere are three things one needs in order to be a true super-villain: arrogance, aggression and baldness.Fortunately, the malefactor in this animated movie suffers from all of the above.Soon after thwarting Metro City's muscle-bound protector, Metro Man (Brad Pitt), for the first and last time, evil genius Megamind (Will Ferrell) becomes bored with no adversary around to antagonize.Therefore, with the help of his minion, Minion (David Cross), he transforms the mild- mannered news cameraman, Hal (Jonah Hill), into a super-hero.But when hotshot reporter Roxanne (Tina Fey) enters the picture, Megamind is too distracted to pay attention to his now corrupt, caped creation that's running amok.Although it does contain a few choice chortles, the bulk of Megamind is simply a retread of other-betteranimated super movies.Furthermore, why would a super-villain waste time constructing a super-hero, when they could be plundering pocket universes for dark matter? (Yellow Light)"
175,Megamind,,31 January 2011,"Mega, Mind you don't miss it","'Megamind' is Dreamworks latest animated film to be released into cinemas. It is a story about your typical Villain and Super-hero who constantly battle each other with the Super-hero always winning. Megamind (Ferrell) is the protagonist and the villain who repeatedly gets defeated by the heroic Metro Man (Pitt). Although this film puts a turn from what is usually the norm and gives us the story from the bad guy's perspective. The plot of 'Megamind' is that after many battles with Metro Man in which he keeps getting defeated he still comes back for another battle but this time he succeeds in destroying Metro Man (by accident). Though first pleased with his victory Megamind soon realises that his life has no purpose with no super-hero to fight. He creates another super-hero to do battle with but things go hay-wire when that super-hero Titan (Hill) goes bad and it is up to Megamind to become the good guy and save the day. This is a refreshing change to the conventional super-hero, good vs evil and allows for a more interesting storyline. Megamind is primarily a super-hero movie spoof and does to super-hero movies what Shrek did to fairy tales. Spoofs often fall flat on their face but 'Megamind' pulls it off with a good deal of comedy, it is cleverly written with some of the funniest elements of the movie being dialogue between characters, one of my favourite being between Megamind and Metro Man via a large television screen. The character of Megamind was extremely well made, he is instantly likable despite being the villain as he is a loser whose plans go wrong and makes mistakes easily. His lines are clever and funny and delivered wonderfully by Will Ferrell whose recognisable voice is instantly funny. Though Metro Man has only a small part in the film he is still a fun character being very typically super-hero. Brad Pitt's voice fits in well for the role as his voice is what you imagine a super-hero's voice to sound like. Jonah Hill as the 'dorky' cameraman and then as super-hero turned bad Titan is less funny than Metro Man and Megamind with only a few funny bits that were down to him, the rest of the time is mostly him destroying things. Tina Fey as the reporter Roxanne and the love interest of Megamind is an important character but not necessarily a funny one being mostly a character for others such as Megamind to bounce funny lines off. She is the love interest of Megamind and this 'love' sub-plot was one of the only aspects of the movie I had a problem with. Megamind is a super-hero movie spoof but fails to poke fun at this romance as there are times and especially towards the end of the movie where there moments that are not meant to be funny of romance between Megamind and Roxanne but can be exceedingly cheesy and cringey and I feel it would've been better if they had made fun at this along with the rest of the movie. Overall 'Megamind' is a fun and entertaining movie that is worth a view as it is guaranteed to get a few laughs out of you at the least a good cast brings the movie together and a clever new storyline cements over some of the relatively small flaws that the movie has."
176,Megamind,9,29 January 2011,Must see movie,"I will write this as short and simple as i can. Firstly. Old story said in a new way (best way till now). Secondly. Excellent voices, excellent visuals, excellent sound! Thirdly. If you watch this closely, you can see some ""eastern eggs"" in there. I'll spoil one for you: The inspector dancing with the guards like in the movie ""Night at the Roxbury"". There is one even in the first 5 minutes of the movie. There are many things that you can like in this movie, not too many to dislike. I do think that ""Megamind"" is better than ""Despicable me"". I like the humor, the jokes, the whole script, more than the other one. I don't like.... almost nothing. Maybe there are a few flat jokes, but not enough to ruin the movie. I hope this will convince you to at least rent the movie if not, go to the cinema and see it.(3D or not)"
177,Megamind,9,13 January 2011,Complete fun... U'll love it,"A brilliant story telling and the most fun I've had after Up. Unique story of superheroes and villains. You are not destined to be someone, you have a choice and you can choose who you want to be. There is never a dull moment in this movie. Every human emotions are perfectly demonstrated. It's got everything love, romance, action, comedy and everything else you want to see in a movie. Every characters part has been perfectly written out with no loose ends. Voice overs are perfect for the characters and the music is just right at the right places.Thanks Dreamworks for a lovely movie.Watch it and love it!!!!!!!!"
178,Megamind,8,9 January 2011,Hilarious !! / What drives many people to the Evil side ??,"The movie thrives on the fast-paced wisecracks and ironic asides, making fun of most of the superhero movie clichés. The plot is predictable at times and unpredictable at other, but it works for the movie.The soundtrack is good, bringing back memories of classics like Highway to Hell, Back in Black, Crazy Train, Welcome to the Jungle and Bad.Will Ferrell as Megamind is simply awesome; flawed but lovable, we pity the guy for all the crap he took that drove him to villainy, we appreciate his intelligence while still laughing at his screw-ups and flamboyant nature. Surprisingly enough, what could've easily just been a purely comic protagonist became a 3-dimensional character, and you find yourself actually rooting for the so-called 'Bad-guy' or Super-villain. David Cross as 'Minion' is simply superb. The movie makes us realize what drives many people to the Evil side; it's just craving for attention.One of my favourite scenes from the movie is the one in which Megamind takes the form of a short stout teacher-like figure with a Don Vito Corleone (from 'The Godfather') face-cut and does a 'Godfather' imitation. I was literally 'Rolling On Floor Laughing' !!"
179,Megamind,8,19 December 2010,Has Heart and Entertains,"While this may not be as cute as ""Despicable Me"" in my opinion, it contributes more to the entertainment of the masses than ""Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs."" ""Megamind"" is one of those ""superhero"" films with every necessary element to insure its eventual place in the ""classic"" category. This one has a rich story, a few twists, and a nice (although unexpected) resolution. The voice cast is most excellent, and I found the story to be compelling.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Megamind. I particularly like the level of character development, which was nominal but enough to endear the characters, leaving more time for story and less time for wasted film. That's always a plus, in my book. As I said, the story is rich, well written, and smartly executed. I'll probably own this as no Will Ferrell collection could possibly be complete without it. ;) All in all, this is a good flick for the kids with a good overall morality. It's fun for adults, too, but probably not for Friday or Saturday night viewing unless you're into the new cartoon revolution (which I seem to be LOL).It rates a 7.8/10 from ...the Fiend :."
180,Megamind,8,28 November 2010,"""If there's still evil, good will rise up against it""","An advance screening was on for this film so I decided to take a trip down to the cinema to see it. DreamWorks impressed earlier this year with How to Train Your Dragon and disappointed with the fourth Shrek film, and I was hoping this would be one of their greater films. I was watching the 3D version of this and was sure impressed with the quality despite it being better colours in 2D but that wasn't such a major deal with a picture like this.The film opens with narration from Megamind and has him falling from a building to his death and this proves to be a significant scene later on in the film. It then reverts to the beginning of his life when he is born and how his parents sent him to Earth just as their house was disintegrating and on the way he met another infant who was also sent to Earth  Metroman. The narration continues as Megamind tells his story of being raised by hardened convicts by learning the good from the bad and how his in his childhood, was bullied by the likes of a young Metroman and many others. The only friend he had really was his companion Minion. Megamind had then realised that if being bad and causing enough trouble to be bullied was his biggest quality, then that is what was going to be the life for him  a villain, the worst he could be.It then takes us to Metroman Day (another significant scene as you see later) in which draws a large crowd and jealous of all the attention, Megamind attempts to disrupt it in a way. His invasion exacerbates the rivalry when he reveals that he has kidnapped news reporter Roxanne Ritchi. An attempt to destroy Metroman ensues when the ""details"" of where Megamind and the trapped Roxanne are, are revealed by Roxanne. This confrontation results in another battle between the two and later in the film Roxanne's cameraman Hal evolves into a superhero after an accident with Megamind and an ingredient. Hal takes up the name Titan.The characterisation is well done despite one downside. Will Ferrell did a marvellous job as Megamind and the Ferrell style of showing a lot of enthusiasm when speaking without going over the top can be noticed. The dialogue used was great too. The downside mentioned was the character Metroman voiced by Brad Pitt. A very good actor, not showing much here, it seems he was hardly trying. Tina Fey was good in her role of voicing Roxanne Ritchi and Jonah Hill was well suited to the role of Hal because he very much looked like him and his characteristics such as wanting the girl throughout the film (a nod to his character Seth in Superbad) were similar. The sound effects in the film were well done and the songs used in the film involved popular much-loved names such as Michael Jackson and AC/DC.Going back to the beginning, it appears DreamWorks have shot back up with this film after Shrek which dropped from the standard of How to Train Your Dragon. 2010 is nearly over and it's been a good year for animation films, especially in 3D in which animation excels over real world pictures at the process. Toy Story 3 amazed, How to Train Your Dragon impressed, Despicable Me was wonderful in my opinion, and Megamind adds to the list of great 2010 animated films. A fantastic film for the kids to watch as the comedy elements are more suited for them but a great story for the whole audience. Even if you're just an avid Will Ferrell fan like me. Worth watching and highly recommended in 3D because of the magnificent rendering. A solid 8/10 from me."
181,Megamind,,21 November 2010,Good Strong Family entertainment :),"I just got back from seeing ""Mega Mind"", and have to say that I really enjoyed it. Even though it was in 3D, the glasses did not darken the image. At least not too much anyway. Did this need to be in 3D? Not to my way of thinking, but it didn't hurt the film either. This film has strong quick witticisms that will have a full packed house laughing through much of the first 20 minutes. We have a basic story with a psychological twist, that only gets better as it goes along.There are parts that are a bit over the top, even for a CGI super-hero comedy, but the film doesn't suffer too much for it. I think it's good solid entertainment, but I think I would only take in another showing if I was with a group of friends and family.Beyond that, ""Mega Mind"" offers a new twist on the super hero craze over the last several years, and should delight most family audiences. Please note however that the music can be a bit loud, and some smaller ears suffered for it in the form of crying and tears in the theatre. Not a big deal. That's what parents are for :) The rest of us without kids should be tolerant given the venue.All in all a good watch. If you have a space $14 burning a hole in your pocket and a free weekend afternoon, give it a shot.Enjoy!p.s. one critique, one of the characters at the end should have made a bigger showing than he did.p.p.s. some of the writing is almost too clever. I got all the humor, but thought it was almost surreal as to how intelligent witty some of the characters were portrayed as being."
182,Megamind,7,11 November 2010,Good Always Triumph even when it's evil,"To get away from scamming car mechanics, I decided to take a break from reality for 90 minutes. Going to to see an animated movie was one way to forget about those overcharging a*!!!! Having already seen Despicable Me earlier this year (which was more of a tearjerker), the comparisons to it, other than the evil guy turning good, there's really not much the same.Megamind has an evil blue guy, but for all his evil, he seems like a guy just wanting a good time, and he finds it in his fights with Metro Man. In the very cliché story of always being the overlooked kid so he turns evil story, Megamind finds purpose in life being the bad boy. When he finally conquers his nemesis, Metro Man, the victory seems empty because he has no one to share it with other than his best buddy, some strange fuzzy transformer fish thing he calls Code.Despicable Me finds happiness being a father, Megamind finds happiness with a news reporter. He transforms himself into some guy name Bernard (didn't anyone feel sorry for that guy?) and gets to know reporter Roxanne Ritchi then suddenly falls for her. All this after he tried to make camera man Hal the new hero, Titan. only to have that backfire as his creation becomes the new face of evil.This movie begins with action, is fast paced, and has a hilarious send up of Marlon Brando as Jor-El in the Superman movie. In all it was a cute movie, and the voice acting was great all around. It's refreshing to see the good guy lose once in a while, but having this not so evil MegaMind character as the focus isn't too bad either"
183,Megamind,8,10 November 2010,"What Shrek was too fairy tales, Megamind is too superheros","A entertaining send up of Superman, but this really takes through the super villains point of view.An alien with a big blue head named Megamind(Will Ferrell) is a super villain because he feels it was his destiny. As with nemesis Metro Man(Brad Pitt), a superman like hero with a Bruce Campbell like grin. One day captures news reporter Roxanne(Tina Fey),in hopes of luring Metro Man in a trap to destroy him, when his plan does work, Megamind quickly feels he is lost without someone to battle with. so he quickly gets a sample of Metro Mans DNA, and puts it into cameraman Hank(Jonah Hill), but Megaminds plan quickly goes down hill, cause instead of creating a hero, he ends up creating a villain, worse than him. How will Megamind put this too an end? Not quite as good as The Incredibles(2004), but still good, Ferrell, Pitt, Fey, and Hill are all good in there voices. It was a funny superhero like send up. It also had great animation also. So if you had enough of Shrek, then give Meghamind a look."
184,Megamind,6,5 November 2010,"Not exactly original or great, but it's cute and still better and funnier than ""Madagascar"".","Well with all of the great/excellent CG-animated films to come out, especially in this year alone, there's always one which is bound to break the streak. Unfortunately, that party-pooper arrives in the form of ""Megamind"", another animated film about a super-villain trying to do good, hot on the heels of Universal's ""Despicable Me"" months ago.Granted, this year also saw the release of Dreamworks Animation's magnum opus ""How To Train Your Dragon"", but this film really brings Dreamworks Animation's status down to earth and back into comedy territory. That's not saying that ""Megamind"" is a bad film. Far from it, actually. It has a great voice cast, great animation, and great technical aspects. It falls short of having a memorable script and a not-so-original story.Let me just get one thing clear - the voice acting is great. As per with Dreamworks you've got a heck of a cast here: Will Ferell, Tina Fey, Jonah Hill, David Cross and Brad Pitt. Megamind's character works with audiences well because of Ferell and his goofball charm that shows whenever Megamind speaks. The love interest, Roxanne Ritchi, is gorgeously animated and given some spunk with Fey's voice. Cross is cute with his henchman role and Pitt sounds like he's having a fun time spoofing the ""Goody-two-shoes"" superhero (maybe himself, as well?), but it is Hill who steals the show when... I'm not going to tell you as it would spoil the film but let's just say he gave his character an extra dimension.Technical wise, the animation is great, with some very detailed action sequences and (in particular one spectacular) explosions. Director Tom McGrath (best known as Skipper, the head honcho of ""The Penguins of Madagascar"") gives life in the film's direction. The movements of characters are very fluid, and they're also designed with the best intentions. The art direction looks great - clean when good is around, dark when ""evil"" is around. The music by Hans Zimmer and his protégé Lorne Balfe suits the right moods. The soundtrack is great and has many songs from both present and especially past, a very eclectic mix.It's the screenplay's problem that gives the film it's downfall. There's nothing really that memorable from it, as it merely sends up the superhero movie genre, ""Superman"" in particular. With many, many references to that 1978 classic, the film loses its originality but has a strong moral core that resonates, especially during the climax of the film - that ultimately, the bad guy can and has to be the good guy. It's not the destination, it's the journey. I personally find Megamind's fate at the end of the movie to be satisfying. It isn't exactly a spoiler, but the film's very predictable at best. And a plus - I find the romantic subplot between Megamind and Roxanne to be extremely sweet, if not corny.Of course, the film also nearly goes back into ""Madagascar"" territory with some childish jokes and dance montages to music (one involving a very obvious Michael Jackson hit). However there's not that many and the film can be a tad too intense for children. Believe me, in the cinema where I watched it, a few children were basically on the verge of fear tears during the action sequences, poor kids were too scared to cry.Besides some jokes which are intended for adults which may fly over the heads of kids, ""Megamind"" is a pleasant watch for a family night out at the movies. It's not Oscar material and one probably won't soon remember it, but it's far from being bad, not even close. It's just a step above mediocre at best.Overall rating: 57/100"
185,Megamind,10,7 November 2010,CODE: This movie is totally Awesome!,"I went to this movie, not having very high hopes for it after seeing a bunch of flops lately. Boy, this blew my (Mega)Mind! Megamind is sweet, funny, adorable, cheesy, and rockin! With impressions of Marlon Brando, the constant saying of ""Me-trocity"", witty dialog, the soundtrack consisting of AC/DC, Guns n' Roses, Black Sabbath, old superhero references and did I say great 3-D effects? This movie was actually worth the extra charge for 3-D (unlike some others). As soon as the credits rolled I was already EXIT-ed to see it again. Great fun for the whole family. Round off 2010 with a cute movie, well worth seeing in 3-D.I would recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm sure I will be quoting it for another few weeks."
186,Megamind,6,5 November 2010,Mega Mediocrity,"Well, Pixar, your jobs are safe ... for now. I am sure that you are well aware that the folks at DreamWorks are rapping on your door. Sure you might have superior graphics and excellent screen writing skills, but in time, others will try for your stature in the industry. After more and more studios jump on the computer animation bandwagon, you will soon be lost in the onslaught. That's still a ways off in the future, though. ""Megamind"" is the newest minion in DreamWorks' army of family animation films (""Shrek"", ""Madagascar,"" ""How to Train Your Dragon""). With an A-List cast, it delivers humor and enough action to keep the audience entertained for the most part. Not a lot of inside jokes for Mom and Dad but the soundtrack (familiar songs by AC/DC and Guns 'n Roses) will provide a nostalgic trip for them while the kiddies are watching a couple of superheroes destroy a city.The film has the essential plot elements of the antagonist and soon-to-be protagonist Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) and his desire to become an evil super genius. In Ferrell's best Vincent Price voice, he narrates to the audience on how he became such an evil mastermind. He also explains his modus operandi on why he wants to be the bane of Metro City (as a running gag he mispronounces the name of the city). We find that he spent his childhood in a prison (one of the world's only fun prisons by the way) and having to compete with Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt) in school (another word Megamind can't pronounce). We follow Megamind's growth into adulthood where he chooses the path of evil while Metro Man chooses the path of good. When Metro Man is accepting an award for being, well, Metro Man, Megamind kidnaps a local news reporter, Roxanne Ritchi (voiced by Tina Fey). A few things go wrong and unknowingly Megamind kills Metro Man. This was not part of the plan. As most of you know if you kill off your nemesis there will be no more adventures. There will be no more extravagant duels. More importantly there will be no more money to be made off of the franchise. When Metro Man ""dies"" and we are left with Megamind and his Minion (voiced by David Cross) to rule Metro City. Megamind quickly decides that it would be best to invent a new enemy so can cure his overwhelming depression. He needs a yin to his yang, someone to fill the void that Metro Man left. He unintentionally injects super serum into Roxanne's camera man's nose (voiced by Jonah Hill). Megamind trains his new protégé, Tighten (which is a misspelled moniker of Titan), to become a superhero so they can have an enormous duel and then Megamind can become the super villain that he once was. While exacting his evil plan, Megamind is falling in love with Roxanne while he is posing as a nerdy museum curator. And while doing that he ... you know what? It is already too confusing. For a kid's movie, the story is about as clear as mud. The exciting final fight scene (which imitates the ending fight scene of Pixar's ""The Incredibles"") is what the kids will remember the most. You will see some exceptional 3D fight scenes through out the film. If you liked the animation DreamWorks did with ""How to Train Your Dragon"" then you won't be disappointed here. Should you see this movie? Are you a kid ages 4-12? Sure, then go see it. Don't try to follow the story too closely, leave that up to Mom and Dad to try to decipher. Eat your popcorn, drink your soda, laugh at some of the crude jokes, try to relate to Megamind when he was a kid and ride it out to the end. Then wait for Pixar to come out with a story that we can all follow."
