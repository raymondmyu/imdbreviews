0,Loving Vincent,9,20 September 2017,Van Gogh's art comes alive,"This beautiful work has made history in the genre of Animation cinema - a precious gift from devoted film-makers. The story is well known - a matter of history. Vincent painted the portrait of Joseph Roulin, Postmaster of Arles. The film tells us the story of Vincent's life and last months before his death on 29 July, 1890 (aged 37) from a self-inflicted gun-shot wound, via the device of the postmaster's son being sent on a mission to deliver a letter from Vincent to his brother, which has been returned. Vincent and his brother Theo were very close, and Theo supported Vincent with regular gifts of money, and painting canvas and tubes of paint. The postmaster Roulin knew and loved Vincent, because these two loving brothers kept up a very frequent correspondence. These letters have been published elsewhere and make very moving reading. The son of Roulin goes to Paris, and to Auvers-sur-Oise where Vincent had been in care after he had an emotional breakdown, and talks to people who knew him. He is at first unwilling, but becomes interested, then passionate to find out the truth of the man whom he is now starting to fully appreciate. The remarkable aspect of this film is that the entire story, 95 minutes of it, is told in hand-painted oil paintings, done in the style of Vincent's own work. Scenes begin with an image that Vincent himself painted and if viewers are familiar with all his works, they will recognize the people and the places. But now they are moving, they are speaking, they are telling their stories, and their impressions of Vincent, the man. Some were fond of him, some ridiculed him. There are various points of view.Technically the film ""Loving Vincent"" is a wonder of animation. One hundred artists in two countries, (Poland and Greece) working in Vincent's own style contributed full colour paintings for ""the present"" and black and white paintings for ""the past"" as the story is being told by the people who knew Vincent.The film is made up of 853 'shots', and each one began with a first frame of a full painting on canvas board. As the animation photography was done in 12 frames per second, the first painting, would then be photographed, then painted over, with each gradual change to certain details or all of it, until the last frame of the shot. (This is in place of the use of animation cels, which could not be applied in this style of work.) At the end of the 'shot' the film-makers were left with an oil-painting on canvas board, of the last frame. So at the end of filming 853 paintings remained, and 200 are being auctioned off, and many have already sold, (as can be seen from the films own website) although at the time of writing the film has not yet premiered in the USA. The size of the works was usually 67cm by 49cm. Bear in mind that for one hour of film, 43,200 paintings were required, and you will begin to see the extraordinary ambition of this project. Additionally 90 design paintings were created in the planning stages during the year before shooting started. The purpose of these was to define the style in which the artists would all re-create Vincent's style of painting and make it move, live and breathe. 65,000 painted frames in oils were made for the whole film. The story moves along briskly and is full of wonderful characters (the people in Vincent's life). The dialogue of the characters is full of expression, as are the faces, and the characters have been created to really ""live"" for us. This was done by casting well known and excellent actors in the main roles, and filming them in live-action, then using those 'normal' cinematic images for a basis of the key paintings for each 'shot'. As the film went on, I recognized (from other films) certain of the painted faces of the real actors, who are also giving voice to the painted characters on the soundtrack. This type of animation has never been done before, and as it took seven years to make the film, it might never be done again. The ingenious planning of how to actually do it is brilliant and has been a great success.Vincent, who suffered, from what we now call bi-polar disease, was an intelligent, deeply sensitive man, who had a sad childhood in a strict bourgeouis family, and was something of a misfit. He showed immense natural art talent. This can be seen clearly and unmistakably by looking at his early drawing. Later he used brush techniques that imitated the 'signature marks' in his pen and ink works. He was understood and saw visual texture.From Paris Vincent went to Provence, and lived in Arles. He begged his friend Gaugin to come and join him. Vincent was over-joyed but after a few months, things went wrong between them, and Vincent seemed to become very distressed. When Gaugin departed, he was inconsolable. After the famous incident of cutting of his own ear in his distress, he went into care of Dr Gachet in Auvers, where he found a kindred spirit in Gachet, who loved art, and recovered. There he did quite a few more strong drawings and paintings. Vincent saw the world in a kind of almost violent motion and most of his works, drawings and paintings show this. It's as if the wind was visible to him in the air itself, not only in the resulting movements of trees, and fields of grain, or the moving sea.He never sold a painting in his own lifetime, but gave away some, and sent many to his brother Theo who attempted to sell them in his Paris art gallery. And yet now his works hold the record as being the most expensive ever sold  which happened in modern times."
1,Loving Vincent,7,15 November 2017,A Visual Feast!,"Every frame of this film is a painting. Think about that! They employed 100 artists to create 65,000+ frames to make this film. I loved the idea that the audience is looking through the eyes of an artist--how an artist might see. If that kind of thing interests you, you should go see this film in the theater. It is stunning.As for the narrative? Well, now, if you know anything about the history of Van Gogh's life, you know it wasn't terribly happy. There is a lot of drinking and smoking and despair to go around. They employ a plot device involving a letter, and it works. Do not go in thinking there will be thundering revelations about the life of the artist. But it offers some quiet insights about some of the subjects of his paintings, and I really loved this.If you are familiar with Van Gogh's works and appreciate his aesthetics, you owe it to yourself to go. A totally unique cinematic experience."
2,Loving Vincent,10,18 October 2017,"A work of art , a masterpiece","This is a unique movie and it is not just a movie. It is a whole new experience ! simply amazing and breathtaking , I almost cried in many parts just by thinking how much work and effort has been put in order to make this film come true. A real masterpiece .A movie suitable for all ages and all types of film lovers. When I came out of the cinema the only word I could think about was ""masterpiece"" . I have nothing bad to comment about this movie really. Nothing to complain. 10/10"
3,Loving Vincent,9,17 October 2017,Real Cinematic Art,"Cinema has always been a gloried artwork and we have much more authentic proof in astounding Loving Vincent.An animated construction entirely brought to life by oil paintings, is  quintessential proof that cinema has still barely scratched the surface of its reaches. Loving Vincent is landmark event for animation and even biographical storytelling through its majestic vision at the last days of Vincent Van Gogh.Set a after the death of fabled painter, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth) is possessed with a letter from Van Gogh to his brother Theo before his death, and begins the journey to deliver it. While on call, Roulin encounters all the people close to Vincent before is death gradually trying to put the pieces of what cause his sudden suicide. From this we are taken back to key moments of Van Gogh's life mesmerizingly displayed through the living oil paintings.Generated by 65,000 paintings by over a 100 artist, Loving Vincent is living work of art. First shot as a live action depiction then adapted into paintings, the immersive gallery of scenes is a first in new format of animation. Directors: Dorota Kobiela, and Hugh Welchman take Van Gogh's own artistry into his own biography (almost), from Citizen Kane style narrative, assessing and celebrating the life of one of the worlds if not the most famous painter. From this production becomes transporting cinema experience into the world of Van Gogh and an enchanting watch of magnificent painting and animation.Of course what is the fundamental strength of Loving Vincent is its captivating artwork which for every moment is spectacular, and then you have the real narrative of Van Gogh's last days which on its own is an affectionate journey. Even if you don't not much about the life of Van Gogh this is an enthralling experience.The monumental presence of the paintings is consistently exceptional with wonderful detail and creation put into it. One of the sensational efforts for the film is its sketch of the real actors, making them instantly recognisable on screen, bringing their performance into the art. Although our eyes are set on visual presence, Clint Mansell's score is also a tear-jerking atmosphere throughout the film, capturing the melancholy as well as joy of Van Gogh.Loving Vincent is a visual sensation, proving the amazing talent that animation brings to the screen. This is by far one of the most significant films of the year and is must see experience, especially for art students."
4,Loving Vincent,8,12 November 2017,"Amazing work of art, telling a melancholic tale","This is one-of-a-kind movie and definitely a must for lovers of Van Gogh. I studied art, therefore I was very interested in seeing how they managed to produce new painting using his technique. The result is visually striking. You can actually experience some of Van Gogh's paintings coming to life, which is in itself pretty amazing.However, a movie must also have a strong script, a good story to go with the visual. The plot is about Armand Roulin, son of Joseph Roulin - two frequent subjects of Van Gogh's portraits. In fact, the whole Roulin family, inclusive of mum Augustine and her other two children were painted several times by Van Gogh, while in Arles.Joseph was Van Gogh's postman and in the movie he entrusts Armand to deliver his last letter to brother Theo. Vincent and Theo's letters were published at the beginning of the last century, shedding light on their affectionate relationship, but not about Vincent's demise. Therefore, Armand sets out to investigate Vincent's last days. The tone is somber and melancholic, somehow clashing with the beautiful visuals. Van Gogh comes across as an enigmatic man who could be sweet and full joy one moment and despondent the next - maybe suffering from bi-polar disorder, but we'll never know.The plot develops a bit slowly in the end we do not know much more of what we knew at the beginning, but for sure we can retain the memory of this fantastic pictorial voyage."
5,Loving Vincent,8,6 September 2017,One of the most visually-striking films ever made,"I saw the film at the Tellride Film Festival and was blown away. I knew that the film would be gorgeous, but the trailer doesn't do the projected feature justice. The oil paintings are mesmerizing on their own, but combined they create a transfixing animation that is completely unique and never gets tiring. The film is worth seeing, and will be forever remembered, for these visuals by themselves. Its only stumble comes from a script that has difficulty in reaching its conclusion, and the use of formulated black-and-white flashbacks to show Vincent's life leave something to be desired (especially when considering the film's other creative achievements.) Even so, the film is an immense triumph that every human being with eyes will love."
6,Loving Vincent,8,15 October 2017,Beautiful,"Vincent Van Gogh was one of the world's most controversial painters, both during his life, and after his death... This film is an examination of the death of this famed artist. It questions the cause of his death. Did he really commit suicide? Or was it something else?... The movie asks the questions, but does not give answers, letting the viewer have the final say...The visual experience is intensely mesmerizing. A team of 100 artists created the 65,000 hand-painted frames in the style of Van Gogh's paintings, giving us a view inside Van Gogh's head, and enabling us to see the world through his eyes...The memorable film score is by the great composer Clint Mansell. As a perfect companion to the story of suspicion and grief, the score enriches the viewing experience while also succeeding as it's own distinct, artistic composition...The only stumble I see comes from the script. The plot is a retelling of what we already know. The story-line is limited to the time of Van Gogh's death, and it does not tell us that much about his work or his life...However, the film is a must-see for Van Gogh fanatics and all art lovers..."
7,Loving Vincent,6,13 October 2017,Visually compelling - but otherwise imperfect,"This is a must-see film for any Van Gogh fanatic or indeed, anyone who is passionate about art. It is innovative and visually striking, and the loving time and attention that has been devoted to the art is clear and obvious throughout.The story itself is not to be repeated here and many people know or believe that they know the Van Gogh story (thanks to his numerous letters he is one of the great artists that we can claim to have a deeper insight into).Where the film struggles is the plot. First of all it's a retelling of a story that many people know. It's clear that the premise was wanting to use the art in a particular way - but actually the story line, the plot, is the secondary consideration.I question how historically accurate the presentation of this story actually is. I would really like to know how they could reference the tensions that exist between different characters and the presentation of different figures. Are they real or imagined for narrative purpose?I get the feeling that the writers wanted to express the dichotomy of Van Gogh - the gentle, perceptive, altruistic man, and also the fiery, troubled, confrontational, argumentative soul. So do they project these perceptions upon their characters - or are these positions anchored in truth?The movement of the film is actually quite slow. I would say that someone who didn't have a specific love of Van Gogh might consider it to be slow and uneventful.Of course the outcome is inevitable and tragic - so the air of melancholy hangs over the whole presentation. It would have been more of an achievement to actually present the joy that must have been present (at least at times) in the soul of this great genius. This doesn't come across because the film is saturated in sorrow.The dialogue is basic and doesn't ever challenge the actors - but the presentation is fine, and at times very good (Chris O'Dowd is my outstanding actor in this film).Bottom line is that this film is saved by the unique presentation - had it been a 'straight forward' film acted in a standard format, it wouldn't have got made, it would be too bland. It would be somewhere between documentary and biography and a little bit dry at that (not for cinema anyway).As it happens, I'm a huge admirer of Van Gogh and I have taken enough interest in him to watch several documentaries and to read a number of accounts of his life. For me this was well worth the wait - and if you're in the same boat you will enjoy it too. If you're not that interested in Van Gogh as an individual you might not get the same kick out of it. It is definitely for a very particular audience."
8,Loving Vincent,9,18 September 2017,"Watch it for the concept, the music, the artists worldwide and of course starry nights.","Last week, at the beautiful Getty Center, we had the chance to view a pre-screening of the movie, 'Loving Vincent,' world's first full-feature film made entirely with oil paintings. Loving Vincent revolves around the mysterious death of the artist Vincent Van Gogh who had created around 800 paintings in his lifetime. What could have been much easily created as an animated or live action feature, ended up being a compilation of over 66000 frames of oil paintings, brought to life with camera movements on still life, CG animation, daunting music and of course skills of over 100 artists. The concept of the movie is a good enough reason to watch this movie but as for the movie itself: read the review ahead!The movie follows the journey of Armand Roulin as he investigates the mysterious death of the artist Van Gogh. The movie retains an air of suspicion and depression throughout. The pace of the storyline is slow as it attempts to combine several theories regarding Van Gogh's death. Yet the village panoramas and aerial shots of Paris add life to the story. As the camera sweeps across the field or up a river as a steam engine pass through the bridge above, one cannot help but notice how beautifully the steam is blending in with the sky. The dialogues have been largely inspired by the letters that Van Gogh wrote to his brothers but lack speech authenticity from the period. However, the dialogues do exhibit the positions of all the characters thoroughly, especially those of Armand Roulin and if not an instant connection with the character, one does eventually the pain and sorrows of Van Gogh towards his end days.The death of Van Gogh was a loss to the world of art but the movie 'Loving Vincent' is a big leap in the world of art and fulfilling the void of the amazing artist, and others like him who suffered because they weren't mentally healthy."
9,Loving Vincent,8,21 October 2017,Two Hearts One Mind,"Absolutely beautiful, a total sensory experience! Over the years I have seen various movies about Vincent and read about his close relationship with his brother Theo. What I found amazing about this movie was the imaginative approach that was taken to unravel his life and work. So many details were revealed that I had no idea of, and put into such interesting context. The choice of actors was brilliant and we see how close they resemble the actual people during the credit roll at the end of the film - also highly imaginative. I love the rich colours, the Cerulean blue and bright yellows. Truly a starry night! Don't miss."
10,Loving Vincent,8,12 October 2017,weathered faces lined in pain,"Greetings again from the darkness. For those skeptics who scoff when filmmaking is described as an art form and labor of love, co- directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman invite you to take in their nearly decade-in-the-making project. It's the first fully hand-painted on canvas feature film - experimental filmmaking crafted by more than 100 artists and including an estimated 130 paintings, with 65,000 individual shots/frames. The spectacular visuals were created by painting over the images  both of actors performing scenes and van Gogh's paintings. By adding to and amending images, even 10 times or more, the scenes come to life with movement and a pulsating psychedelic feel. The familiar colors of his paintings create a level of connection, while black & white images are used for flashbacks and reenactments. Though we have never seen this look on screen before (this goes beyond Linklater's WAKING LIFE), the stunning visuals are accompanied by what can be described as a detective story or murder/suicide mystery. It picks up in 1891, one year after van Gogh's suspicious death. A local Arles postman holds one last letter from Vincent to his beloved brother Theo. Having held onto it for much too long, he asks his son Armand Roulin to hand-deliver the letter to Theo. Sporting the yellow blazer so recognizable from his portrait, the angry and skeptical Armand heads to Paris. Little does he know, this is only the beginning of his journey  a journey that finds him researching Vincent's life and a journey that helps him discover more about himself.There have been many movies made focusing on this amazing artist: LUST FOR LIFE (1956), VINCENT (1987), VINCENT & THEO (1990), and VAN GOGH (1991). This one is filled with contrasting and conflicting stories, theories and recollections, and descriptions of events from those who crossed paths with the artist on a daily basis. We listen right along with Armand as he spends time in Avers-sur-Oise  where Vincent lived, painted, and died.Many of the actors involved are recognizable even in this artistic format: Chris O'Dowd is the postman, Douglas Booth is Armand, John Sessions plays art supplier Pete Tanguy, Eleanor Thompson is the innkeeper's daughter Adaline, Jerome Flynn is the controversial Dr. Gachet, Saoirse Ronan is Gachet's daughter Margarita (recognizable from her piano portrait), Helen McCrory plays the disgruntled Gachet housekeeper, Aidan Turner is the boatman, and Robert Gulaczyk is Vincent. Since these folks were all part of van Gogh's artwork, we are fascinated to see them come to ""life"". Vincent van Gogh picked up a brush for the first time at age 28. He was dead at age 37, and left behind approximately 800 paintings of portraits and landscapes  many among the most famous pieces in the world today. Did he try to commit suicide as he claimed or was there a more sinister explanation for his death? Of course the filmmakers only hint at possible answers and can't solve a mystery that is approaching two centuries. Understanding the man is challenging, and perhaps our best hope is through the work he left behind. This is a compelling cinematic experience and we have certainly benefited from the filmmaker's labor of love. Clint Mansell's score leans heavily on strings and piano, and is perfect accompaniment for the story. One could question the closing credits use of Lianne La Havas' version of ""Vincent"" (renamed ""Starry Starry Night"") rather than Don McLean's, but one mystery per day is plenty. Spot the paintings, play detective, and mostly enjoy the visuals built on the works of a complex, talented, and tragic figure."
11,Loving Vincent,10,27 October 2017,Absolutely mesmerizing.,"Not only was it a completely new experience in film, it was incredibly moving as it was aesthetically wonderful. I don't think I've ever seen such a beautiful sequence of images in film. The story was also quite emotional- all in all, I cried tears of many mixed emotions from the beginning to the end of it. I didn't want it to be over- ever. They say that movies are the images of our dreams, but it's never been truer than it is for Loving Vincent- literally, dreams painted onto the silver screen. Don't miss the opportunity to watch on the big screen while you can."
12,Loving Vincent,,4 October 2017,"Visually arresting, but only partially successful","There is practically a cottage industry devoted to Vincent Van Gogh. Not just films, but, music, plays and merchandising. Directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman distinguish themselves by making this a Painted animated feature. Employing over 100 artists who undertook the daunting task of creating 65,000 painted frames (much of it painted over conventionally filmed scenes with actors).It certainly is a visual delight. Of course, there is a frisson in the room whenever a frame depicts one of the master's paintings. But, this isn't just a stunt picture. There is a lot of passion for Van Gogh and his work on display. The frame of the story takes place a year after Van Gogh's death with a man, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth), seeking to find out the circumstances of his death. The flashbacks are shown in Black & White and are less overtly 'painted' than the present day fully painted sections. The most famous of the actors is Saorise Ronan as Dr. Gachet's daughter Marguerite. Most of the characters are directly from Van Gogh's work and letters, while others are 'inspired' by them. As visually appealing as LOVING VINCENT is, it's more than a bit unfortunate that the investigation angle comes off as a bit trite at times, and the dialogue is often flat when not downright unconvincing.Still, this is a unique picture that is worthy of a look by anybody interested in Van Gogh and the art of filmed animation. Fine score by Clint Mansell as well."
13,Loving Vincent,,23 November 2017,Beautiful.,"It's my first review for a movie, and I'll keep it short. The movie is heart warming, exquisitely done and, if you stay for the ending soundtrack, you will be treated to a wonderful song which summarizes the movie through music. His story is dramatic and a very good reminder of how we, as humans, don't know how to appreciate valuable people during their lifetime. This movie will enrich your life."
14,Loving Vincent,8,13 November 2017,Not a One Trick Pony,"Most of the focus will be on its incredibly innovative visuals, the entire film is animated oil paintings. The paintings are all in Van Gogh's style are they are a beautiful backdrop that brings incredible life to the film in a way that no other style possible could.But there is much more to Loving Vincent than the art, it is a riveting story that dives into who Vincent Van Gogh was as a man and the mystery surrounding his death. It unfolds in the same manner as ""Citizen Kane"" with the posthumous exploration into a person through talking to the people who knew him. It is engrossing with excellent voice work and incredibly smooth animation and movement."
15,Loving Vincent,5,6 January 2018,It could be much better.,"The picture 
The original Van Gogh's paintings are no doubt beautiful. Every second of this movie is a masterpiece. Every frame is handpainted and the whole movie is completed by 100 artists. However, different artists have difference style of painting, and even though they tried very hard to accomodate the differences by painting the same style, the audience could still notice those differences. That is the main drawback of the picture in this movie. The storyline 
It reminds me of RPG games. You, playing as the main character, talk with people to get 'clues' or 'objects', and reveal the story along the way. This is common practice of an RPG game. For a movie, it is a bit too simple. History is definitely not an excuse for a simple plot. If the story is not exciting, then it should be more philosophical and discuss something deep throughout the movie. The whole 'don't focus on his death but focus on his life' thing is really the biggest sacarsm to the entire story."
16,Loving Vincent,4,1 January 2018,"A for effort, but quantity over quality eventually","""Loving Vincent"" is a new Polish-British movie in the English-language that runs for a bit over 1.5 hours and was written and directed by Dorota Kobiela and Oscar winner Hugh Welchman. The cast of voice actors includes many known names, especially Saoirse Ronan I guess, a recent Oscar nominee and she may have a chance to get in this year too. As for this film here, it certainly does as well. Solid recognition from the Annies and a Golden Globe nomination make this a potential Oscar nominee with maybe even a dark horse shot at the win. It's probably everybody against Coco at this point. The film plays briefly after the death of painter Vincent van Gogh as we follow a future policeman's investigation into the death of Vincent. And the longer his research continues, the more personal it becomes for him. He meets several people who played a more or less crucial role in Vincent's life, friends, (potential) lovers, but also some you may consider foes. Will he be able to deliver the letter? That one gets solved really quickly through history. The heart and soul of the film is the animation and this aspect is also what everything is about in how well you will like this movie. For me it was sadly a negative deal breaker, perhaps because I am not really that big on actual paintings. You could call it a motion painting for sure and this is also what brought up all these superlatives and the awards attention it got I'm sure. Yes the effort is massive here, but is that really enough to make it a convincing movie. Not for me, especially as the animation style made my eyes hurt quite a bit, the new sequences, not the b&w flashbacks. However, with these I must say I was wondering why the faces were so much clearer there. It cannot just be the clear memories. I swear this was Ronan's actual face, not the animated equivalent. These flashback sequences make sure there is enough of scenes with the actual van Gogh in here as he was still alive at that point. The best thing, maybe the only really good thing was were the closing credits. The singer here certainly wasn't on par with Don McLean, but the song is just so amazing and miraculous that it is impossible to not feel anything while listening to it. And the images sure go well along too with what we hear. Shame though you have to sit through 90 minutes to get to that point, 90 minutes that are genuinely mediocre for the most part with characters and a story that rarely make a difference. I wonder if they held him back character-wise to not take away any focus from van Gogh? But then why turn him into a truly significant character near the end again saying how this letter is all about his journey from now on. Does that mean it was all consideren pointless before? Anyway, I was pretty surprised that the film actually got our theatre almost full to the last seat. Did not expect audiences to show such an interest in it. Of course, this may be an animated movie, but style and story never make it one for kids. They won't understand it and they'll be quickly bored perhaps. Finally, even if I give this film a thumbs-down and a negative recommendation and don't understand the great amount of praise and awards recognition, let me end this review on a positive note by saying I really enjoyed the ways in which they included many of van Gogh's paintings here. Still I suggest you watch something else instead."
17,Loving Vincent,9,5 November 2017,Captivating visually; an unsettling account of van Gogh's passing,"""Loving Vincent"" is easily one of the most visually beautiful films I've seen in my decades as an avid film-goer, the hand-painted filmmaking technique turning out to be a perfect and memorable way of illustrating one part of van Gogh's life story. The overall experience is ultimately quite sad and tragic--fitting, of course, for what van Gogh went through in his relatively brief lifetime, and especially during his very brief time painting what turned out to be his masterpieces. This particular view of his life left me wanting to read more on what happened in his final days, curious to know more facts, and also sparked my wanting to revisit his paintings after long years of not having viewed them. It rekindled the feelings I had when I first studied and enjoyed them decades ago. I do recommend the film for anyone interested in van Gogh, or the creative process in general. It is a singular experience, like nothing else I've seen, and the film leaves a lasting impression."
18,Loving Vincent,8,30 October 2017,It Leaves an Impression,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An visual and artistic success that paints its subject with the heaviest of brushstrokes in its muddled narrative structure.SYNOPSIS: An animated film about the death of Vincent Van Gogh rendered in his painting style. JIM'S REVIEW: Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman's love affair with the work of Vincent Van Gogh are on display in their full length animated homage, Loving Vincent. This tribute to one of the most lauded (posthumously) and greatest artist of all time tells the tragic death of the painter by making his Impressionist artwork that come to life. The filmmakers gathered a team of talented craftspeople together to film live action actors to tell the story and then meticulously paint over the actual actors in Van Gogh's signature painting style. The results are truly astonishing, even if the story becomes problematic (as with most animated films of late). The brushstrokes are frequent and fluid as they transition from scene to scenes, glorious golds swirl seamlessly with royal blues, and the effect is state-of-the-art animation that, well, impresses. Realistically rendered black and white flashback sequences contrast with more colorful scenes that come directly from Van Gogh's paintings and serve as a backdrop to the plot. But take away the stunning visual look of the film and the story doesn't hold up.The story focuses on Van Gogh's final days and becomes a whodunit of sorts, a conspiracy theory for art lovers everywhere. Did Vincent really commit suicide or was it murder? Paging Hercule Poirot!One wishes the screenplay would have spent more time focusing on the life of the artist rather than his semi-mysterious death. The narrative opportunities remain confused and simplistic. It's all talk, dull talk at that, with little action. The lines (or strokes) blur the truth with fiction and creates a false sense of reality. Were more time spent on a far-fetch theory that served as the film's major story-line, this film would be perfection. Instead we will settle for a gorgeously animated movie with much to see and little to say except conjecture.Yet there is much to admire in their creative vision. The filmmaker's own work of passion is evident in every frame of this film. The fact that it took ten years to complete this project shows the earnestness and dedication of all the artisans involved. Visually arresting but story-wise far-fetched, Loving Vincent just gives off the wrong Impression, no matter how lovely it is to behold."
19,Loving Vincent,10,30 October 2017,"Not just artistic, it's a well conceived and well executed interesting story","I normally prefer action movies but went to this with my wife and daughter and really expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised.1) Beautiful artwork. This should win an award for the artwork alone. Not only is it clever, its well integrated with van Goghs style.2) The story starts out slow but gets interesting. A who done it leading us deeper and deeper into a mystery. This is not a boring artsy movie, the story stands on it's own.3) Interesting and sometimes likable characters. The actors and actresses did a nice job. The personality of the characters comes through.4) Nice closing song.If you hate art, and hate movies that aren't action packed you probably wont like it. If you like van Goghs work, and are willing to put up with a slower developing who done it, I highly recommend this movie. It's the most creative and visually appealing movie I've seen in years."
20,Loving Vincent,3,6 November 2017,Impressionist Noir,"The final days of Vincent Van Gogh could have been the subject of an intriguing movie, but 'Loving Vincent' throws away most of its potential by using a gimmicky pseudo-Impressionist animation technique. The film's screenplay invents the clever device of sending a young man called Armand to deliver a mislaid letter from the deceased artist to his brother Theo. When Armand discovers Theo has also died, his attempts at postal delivery mutate into a private eye investigation focused on the mysterious circumstances surrounding Vincent's death from a gunshot wound.Armand's inquiries reveal a sympathetic side to the troubled and obsessive artist, and they begin moving into mildly suspenseful territory as Vincent's former associates contradict each other over details of his relationships and last hours. Unfortunately the distracting animation of Van Gogh's painting style undermines the narrative's serious turn, since it can't convey a character's nuanced expressions to the same extent as an actor. In the end Armand's fishing expedition doesn't net any big catches - and watching the conveyor belt of third-rate Van Gogh copies being produced at 12 frames per second eventually becomes tiresome."
21,Loving Vincent,2,9 November 2017,A gimmicky poorly written movie that presents a theory as fact,I admit to being apprehensive on watching this film because of the fear that the film makers would fail at properly representing a revolutionary artist. The opening credits did much to dispel this but as it turned out those credits were the best part of this whole waist of time. Where to start with the problems. Van Gogh was a Dutch painter that found his style in France. Yet the dialogue varies from actors with British or Irish accents. For God's sake at least let the French characters have a French accent if you don't have the balls to film in the actual language! The writers put together a script that resembles knock off Polish Hollywood because that is what it is. They proved to be poor stewards of his life.Vincent Van Gogh lived a fascinating life. This movie focuses on only on his death with stereotypical black and white flash backs to his past. It highly presses the flawed but recent theory of his death as truth. They want all viewers to believe that Van Gogh was a victim of Manslaughter if not murder instead of his mental illness. This dabbling in history is wrong and shows how little they understand the man and his art. This is the furthest thing from an Art film.....
22,Loving Vincent,10,23 October 2017,A True Masterpiece,"""Loving Vincent"" is a film to be seen by all ages, and can be seen many times. Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman created a masterpiece with ""an orchestra"" of very fine 125 artists who produced each frame - an oil painting - 65,000.00 frames, in all, of the animated Van Gogh' story. In the history of animation, frames were produced by hand, but never in a form of oil paintings with such rich texture, mimicking Van Gogh's strokes. Art teachers can use ""Loving Vincent"" as a material to teach modern art, to make students fall in love with art and become artists. A simply stunning achievement of two directors who combined their best talents and created a new classic."
23,Loving Vincent,5,22 November 2017,Pity the animators,"This felt very much like a missed opportunity, and was disappointing on both a narrative and visual level. Most of the film consists of back and forth conversational head-shots as the main character goes on a bizarre whodunnit trail regarding Vincent's death which ultimately goes nowhere (spoiler: Vincent dunnit). The dialogue is poor, and it comes across like a mix of an ITV Sunday afternoon detective programme and a montage of video game cutscenes.The animation itself in these segments is off-putting, as the level of detail given to the actors' rotoscoped faces is too high for you to feel like you are watching anything but filmed footage. The effect comes across as something that could have been more simply achieved by using a snapchat filter, and you can't help feel sorry for the animators who had to paint variations of the same face hundreds of times in order to deliver these dreary scenes. The point of animation and of art is to capture an essence of life, yet the much lauded approach taken in this film is devoid of soul and as such seems a massive waste of effort.When the film allows for a more imaginative use of the animated painting effect in it's few less presentational and more cerebral moments the whole thing manages to engage much more. These sections typically focus more on Vincent's actual life (which is surely what audiences are interested in, not in conspiracy theories surrounding his death) and are free of the monotonous talking segments. I can't help but feel this would have been a better focus for the film, and that the medium of animation could have been used to explore his psyche in an unusual and interesting manner rather than to deliver a rote story that tells us very little."
24,Loving Vincent,7,11 November 2017,"""Loving Vincent"" is far from being a masterpiece, but it's still an interesting and distinctive movie","I've seen several movies inspired by the life and art of a painter and now I think that it's really hard to go wrong choosing such movie. I can still remember movies such as ""Goya"", ""Frida"", ""Love is the devil"" or ""Girl with a pearl earring"" although I've seen them many years ago. Movies about painters aren't copies of other movies. The art of a painter can be an inspiration for shots and scenery of a movie. The life of a painter and his paintings can help to come up with an original plot.""Loving Vincent"" contains hundreds of animations based on paintings created by Van Gogh. I wouldn't be surprised to see it in a short music video, but in a full-length movie it really comes as a surprise. I can recommend ""Loving Vincent"" just for that reason.The plot makes ""Loving Vincent"" a sort of a detective story. After allegedly suicidal death of Vincent Van Gogh his friend tries to establish the motives of Vincent's decision and all the events that led Vincent to the suicide. In my view that odd perspective of telling about Vincent Van Gogh and the ""detective"" plot of the movie are its weak points.Overall, though ""Loving Vincent"" is far from being a masterpiece, it's still an interesting and distinctive movie."
25,Loving Vincent,2,6 January 2018,This is an animated movie,"This is an animated movie - like a Disney comic movie - but done in a fake Van Gogh style. 
The characters are not historical people, the names may be but the characters are as false as a talking mouse. 
So - it is NOT an art movie. It is NOT a documentary. It is NOT a bio-pic.
It is to Van Gogh's art what The Lion King is to the Serengeti.
If you like movies with talking mice saying cute things, you may like this one."
26,Loving Vincent,,23 November 2017,Impressive in its achievement,"This was actually better than expected! When I first heard about it I was beyond excited. It seemed like such an impressive technical achievement. Then the reviews started coming out and they seemed to indicate that technically it was impressive but substance-wise, it wasn't all that great. I think it's a flawed piece and the animation is definitely the most impressive thing about it, but story-wise it was actually quite moving, and the cast is absolutely wonderful. I guess wanting to solve a kind of mystery like this is bound to be somewhat problematic, but I admire the filmmakers' ambition for trying to go there. Most importantly, although the animation was always going to be impressive, I wondered whether it would make the viewing experience sometimes hard to get into. I heard some of those criticisms but I honestly thought the whole thing worked. I would say it's rather underrated and I hope the filmmakers are bale to get an Animated Feature Oscar nomination."
27,Loving Vincent,9,14 November 2017,"just general spoilers, nothing too specific. GREAT MOVIE!","I really loved this film. The painting animation was glorious, and they really captured Vincent's style in every scene. The flashbacks are in black and white, and when only black and white colours are used, the figures seem more clear, stable, as if symbolizing the truth being revealed, and everything becoming a little more clear. The use of music is really good, and I was really touched when the ending came."
28,Loving Vincent,7,30 October 2017,"Groundbreaking, unique, and stunning visuals utilized to illustrate a bland BBC historical drama","Loving Vincent came out of nowhere for me, the film was advertised once, and that was enough to grab my attention.Visually, Loving Vincent is very unique and stunning. The audacity to display a film entirely through oil-painted canvases was not only a challenge, the style also ensured authenticity and gave respect to the artist. It's a pity that these stressful tools are utilized to be an overlay for a bland BBC historical drama.The reason why I refer to Loving Vincent as a 'BBC historical drama' is due to the similarities in tone, script, and sound design. While intending to illustrate a setting in the 1800's, the film instead illustrates a manufactured modern setting that feels out of place. The script for the film is a very theatrical and bland. This aspect alone is what decreases the quality of the film in my opinion, as the film is dialogue-driven. As a result you're not invested due to the lack of engagement or immersion.Once I gleamed at the cast for Loving Vincent, I was concerned. Douglas Booth has always been a terrible actor in every film I've seen him in. However, he was surprisingly authentic for this film. However, the acting wasn't substantial at all, and drained the life out of the film in my opinion.If Loving Vincent was manipulated slightly, the film could be enjoyable as a visual experience, however the film is constructed by its dialogue. Therefore, you'll have to juxtapose the best and the worst aspect of this film together."
29,Loving Vincent,8,5 November 2017,Great work of art,"Loving Vincent opens the world of Vincent's paintings in a 3 dimensional way. Something which I'm very grateful for. The story line is alright, and has some convincing parts, some less convincing. It doesn't matter.. It's fascinating to find oneself, for the length of the movie, in his world. I like the colored paintings the most, the black- and white are a bit strange in this 'Vincent language'. It's a fascinating project, with all these artists working on it. The money is very well spend European money, if I understood correctly that it is made at the time and with the money of Poland being the creative center of Europe. (2016) These kind of creative projects are crossovers at it's best!!"
30,Loving Vincent,10,5 November 2017,Will go down as a classic....,"This is a film that will go down as a classic like ""Penny Serenade"" or ""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a day."" We all think we know Vincent Van Gogh; like Beethoven and his Fifth Symphony, he has an impact on the collective psyche of humanity. This film takes a simple premise, the need to deliver a letter, and attempts to trace the last moments of Vincent Van Gogh, this taking place in 1891--a year after Vincent's suicide The directors took his paintings, including his portraiture, and morphed a story line with animation moving through a time-line of Vincent's last days.The story is told through Armand Roulin, son of Postman Roulin, who is expected to deliver the letter and on his way he attempts to learn from eyewitness of Vincent's last days. (Think Thorton Wilder's ""Bridge of San Luis Rey"".) He talks to these various people.And here is one of the not so small caveats. Vincent committed suicide on 29 July, 1890; he painted the portrait of Adeline Ravoux in June of 1890 when she was 12 years old; she can be recognized in the film from the 1890 portrait. Given that many 12 year old in 1890 would have a certain maturity, still the Adeline Ravoux depicted on film is clearly a grown up, not a 13 year old child, which is what she would be in 1891. She appears int the film as tall as Armand, which would be unusual for a 12/13 year old, even allowing for growth spurts. While we recognize many of Vincent's paintings, they do morph so one is lost on where the painting ends and the morphing begins. What part is a Vincent, and what part is morph? No small or irrelevant question there. We are forced to return to the books of his painting to help us discern the difference. Like that is a bad thing? As the movie progresses, the old man, posits a theory of murder not suicide as the cause of death. Armand, citing from a letter written a few weeks before Vincent's suicide, asks the question of how a person goes from being calm and six weeks later committing suicide. Of course, in 1890, the notion of bi-polar, manic-depression would have been unknown; something the modern mind is all too familiar with. So Armand wonders about the feasibility of murder as an alternative to suicide. By the end of the film, Dr. Paul Gachet, who treated Vincent and also recognizable from Vincent's portraiture, offers an explanation that Armand seemingly accepts.The story that unfolds about Vincent Van Gogh is a very human story; while there are serious caveats, it is still an excellent film and will be established as a classic. Vincent only painted for eight years, starting at age 28; in that 8 year period he created 800 works, of which only one was sold. Presumably, letters make up the back story that unfolds in the film; though that would include another level of scholarship."
31,Loving Vincent,10,4 November 2017,Solid visuals n superb film.,"One year after the death of Vincent van Gogh, Postman Roulin requests that his son Armand personally deliver Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo, after previous attempts to mail the item failed. Despite not having been fond of Van Gogh and recalling the incident when the deceased mutilated his ear and gifted it to a local prostitute, Armand begrudgingly accepts due to his father's affection for the painter. Postman Roulin acknowledges Van Gogh's mental illness and blames the other townspeople for ostracizing and driving him out. He also expresses bemusement about the cause of Van Gogh's death, as he had received a letter from him six weeks prior to the suicide that showed him in a calm and normal mood."
32,Loving Vincent,1,5 November 2017,WAKE ME UP Before I GOGH GOGH To Sleep!,"My goodness, what a B O R I N G experience seeing this film was! I thought this might be interesting-- WRONG! Thought it might be visually stunning--WRONG! The visuals actually made me feel dizzy and slightly sick, and I'm a fan of found footage films like Blair Witch Project and don't find those films to make me feel ill. The only thing good to say about this experience-- I didn't know the details of of Gogh's demise. But really, it all plays out in such an uninteresting manner. I found myself tuning out the dialogue and looking away from the screen. I congratulate myself for not only seeing this in its entirety, but staying ALL THE WAY until the final credit had rolled to see who performed the mediocre cover version of the song that was playing. And now for something that will most assuredly anger those who LOVED this film-- I can't help but think this would have been less tedious had it been live action and not a cartoon (yes, I know... lovingly hand-painted animation frame by frame.) Just thinking about this experience is making me want to have a nice nap."
33,Loving Vincent,5,26 November 2017,Disappointed,"When you have seen so many films in your life, the anticipation to watch something new raises your expectations, sometimes excessively. Unfortunately I was visually disappointed, possibly for being misinformed regarding the frames. The matter is that the movie was announced that 65,000 paintings were made but I do not quite agree with this data, on the contrary, constantly I felt I was watching South Park. A very graphic example of this and shown in most of the pictures, it is that for i.e., 10 frames aren't 10 different paintings but 1 that has been modified 9 times, and I'm sorry, but for me those are not 10 final paintings. One of the grossest examples is when windmill blades are turning: the corrections were poorly executed and after approximately the tenth correction, a massive one was made to cover all the previous small ones. I don't think I'm being too strict in this matter, what happens is that too many frames are too flawed, and those flaws, in my opinion, demerits the star of the film, which are the paintings themselves, in contrast to the scenes in black and white that do not have that type of visible corrections. I understand that the scenes in black and white were carried out differently to the color ones, however the transition of movement is completely different, my retina just cannot forgive it. To be clear on this point, except for the first painting of each sequence of paintings, the following ones looked like a drawing of a child who must erase and erase constantly different pencil strokes to complete the drawing, therefore leaving a trail of seen semi deleted strokes. In a child drawing however this is forgiven and the effort appreciated. The narrative didn't convinced me much either. However I understand that in this movie the narrative is just there to link Vincent's pictures first, and then to tell parts of his life. I feel the narrative in this movie just as a secondary component; but as the visual part in colors did not covered my expectations I needed to lean on the narrative to support the visual aspect. Unfortunately I could not do that. I have to say that I could not finish watching the move, it bothered me so much visually that had to quit halfway through it. Excellent idea, I applaud the boldness on changing the painting seasons, but mediocre execution in the frame-by-frame color paintings, poor music, for me it is a 5 stars movie."
34,Loving Vincent,7,3 November 2017,Visual feast,"It doesn't matter if the movie plays fast and loose with the facts, what they were attempting and was accomplished is a feast for the eyes. This hand painted animated feature looks great on the screen. When a character walks through a field, there's a hay stack deprecated like a painting.The movie feels a bit long and the technique is a bit unsteady at the start. Some of the scenes are redundant with the dialogue explaining to one character the information given not long before by another character. There's a good score and the characters are well voiced. The main reason to recommend the movie is the look. The movie is in very limited release, but worth seeking out. Ignore the the constant chatter and enjoy the visual."
35,Loving Vincent,,31 October 2017,Brilliant and beautiful!,"My independent film group showed Loving Vincent last night. I'd say from the feedback is was an overwhelming success. Here are some of the remarks I heard: Brilliant, amazing, I didn't want it to end, a visual feast,remarkable, I'm going to read about his life... After viewing the trailer, I wondered if the concept of the hand painted animation would get old in the first few minutes. Well, it didn't. I can't wait to see this film again to see what I missed while I was carried away marveling at how certain flowers were painted or how they got the shading and expression on the characters' faces. I didn't want it to end. I loved that I felt I was looking at a full size Van Gogh and suddenly there was a figure walking through it. I think that it helped that it was on the large theatre screen as the visually dimension of the movie could easily be missed on a smaller screen. The characters are well played and the painters have done a wonderful job of giving dimension and emotion to them. The characters' eyes are amazing. The starry skies are amazing. The movie is amazing. The story line is interesting enough to carry the movie but not a blockbuster. Overall, I loved this movie. Any movie that can move people to talk about and to research the subject is an overwhelming success. See it."
36,Loving Vincent,6,30 October 2017,Loving Vincent,"I heard about this animated movie a short time before its release, what makes it really special is that it took 6 years to make, with over 65,000 individual oil paintings, by 115 artists, the producers called it a ""labour of love"", as an art lover, especially of animation, I was looking forward to it. Basically set in the 19th century, one year after the death of artist Vincent van Gogh (Robert Gulaczyk), Armand Roulin (Great Expectations' Douglas Booth) is requested by his father, Postman Joseph Roulin (Chris O'Dowd), to personally deliver Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo (Cezary Lukaszewicz). Armand was not fond of Van Gogh, he recalls the deceased artist mutilating his ear and gifting it to a prostitute, but he begrudgingly accepts his father's request, Postman Roulin the artist's mental illness and blames the townspeople for ostracising and driving him out. Armand visits Père Tanguy (John Sessions), who informs him that Theo suffered became depressed, suffered from syphilis, deteriorated and died shortly after his brother's death, Tanguy recalls Van Gogh's eventual pursuit of art after several career path failures. Tanguy describes Van Gogh's funeral, and mentions Doctor Gachet (Jerome Flynn), who housed Van Gogh after his release from an asylum, he shared his love for art, he treated Van Gogh as family and was visibly distraught at the funeral. Armand travels to Auvers-sur- Oise, Dr. Gachet is out on business, his housekeeper Louise Chevalier (Helen McCrory) expresses contempt for Van Gogh, Armand waits for the doctor's return and decides to stay at the local inn Van Gogh had during his time in the area. There he meets temporary proprietress Adeline Ravoux (Eleanor Tomlinson), she had been present during Van Gogh's apparent suicide attempt and eventual death, she describes him as a quiet and eccentric man who loved his art and his children. Like Armand's father, she admits to being surprised at his suicide, as he had seemed in good spirits and had ordered more paint to continue his art. Armand follows Adeline's suggestion to visit the local Boatman (Aidan Turner), who informs him that Van Gogh was in close to Dr. Gachet's daughter Marguerite (Saoirse Ronan). Armand meets Marguerite, she claims she did not have a close relationship with Van Gogh, he suggests Van Gogh's suicidal mood was brought on following an argument with her father, who forbade her from seeing him, she rejects this. Armand continues to investigate Van Gogh's death, he questions why he returned to the inn and shot himself in the stomach rather than in the head, he finds out later that he was shot in a different location than the one reported. Van Gogh was in the company of some local boys, including Rene Secretan (Marcin Sosinski), who often drunkenly waved a gun around town. Armand visits the boatman again, he is informs him that Rene enjoyed tormenting and humiliating Van Gogh, Armand also visits Doctor Mazery (Bill Thomas), who examined Van Gogh, he tells that the shot that killed Van Gogh came from a distance, suicide was ruled impossible. Meeting with Marguerite again, she admits to Armand she was indeed close to the artist, but not romantically, and the argument between him and her father was not about her. Armand theorises to Marguerite that a drunken Rene accidentally shot Van Gogh, she says that no matter what happened, Van Gogh was still dead and his life mattered more than the circumstances of his death. Dr. Gachet finally returns and promises to deliver Armand's letter to Theo's widow, the doctor says that depressed patients' moods can vary wildly, he could easily have gone calm to suicidal in six weeks. The guilt-ridden Gachet admits to being envious of Van Gogh's talent and commitment to art, the argument was due to Van Gogh calling him cowardly for not pursuing his passion, the enraged Gachet accused the artist of making Theo's health worse due to a profitless pursuit of art, he theorises Van Gogh was driven to suicide to release Theo from the burden. In the end, Armand returns home, his father received word from Theo's widow, Johanna, thanking Armand for returning the letter  signed, ""Your loving Vincent."" The end credits reveal that Armand joined the army, Adeline married a local innkeeper, Marguerite remained unmarried and kept Van Gogh's painting of her for over 40 years, and Rene Secretan admitted on his deathbed to tormenting Van Gogh, but claimed Van Gogh stole his gun. It also says that Vincent Van Gogh painted over 800 paintings in just 8 years, none of which sold to the public, though he would go on to be named by art historians as the father of modern painting. Also starring Richard Banks as Ravoux Regular and Shaun Newnham as Landlord of The Night Cafe. The cast all do their parts fine, and the story is mildly interesting, looking into the last days of the artist who only became famous after his death, but let's be honest, it's the animation that is really the best things about this film, the colourful wash of colour to bring the characters and scenery to life is impeccable, including clever black and white flashback scenes, ""the world's first fully painted feature film"" is a most watchable animated drama. Good!"
37,Loving Vincent,9,26 October 2017,A Visual Feast Like None Other,"If you've ever had the privilege to see a Van Gogh up close, you know that the painting always seems to be in a state of kinetic motion, with its vibrant colors and furious brushstrokes. Loving Vincent takes that motion to the next logical step - it literally animates the paintings. A team of artists copied Van Gogh's works precisely - color for color, stroke for stroke - and then set them in motion, using them as the basis for a detective story of sorts tracing the last days of the painter's life.Watching this film, your eyes are dazzled over and over. You keep thinking, ""Haven't I seen this painting somewhere before?"" - and then, when you see the closing credits (which display the animators' reference materials), you realize that you have. Every character in this film is based on a person in Van Gogh's art, every backdrop is drawn from his landscapes. It took a lot of imagination to put all those parts together and make it a whole. (You're going to want to see this on a real theater screen if the opportunity presents itself. I'm not sure if the depth of the details will be conveyed in smartphone or tablet viewing).Other reviewers have pointed out that the story is the film's weakest point, and I will agree with that - I've knocked off a star for that reason. But, really, the story is not what you're going to be coming to this film for. With visuals this sumptuous, you don't really need an Oscar-quality script.I will say one thing about the story, though - kudos to the filmmakers for getting The Ear out of the way early on in the plot. You know going into a film about Van Gogh that it's going to be dealt with, you sit there half-cringing waiting for the moment . . . and the filmmakers made it one of the first flashback sequences. ""Okay, you all know it's coming, here it is. Now you can put that aside and focus on the rest of our film.""It's not a film for everyone, but those who enjoy art should make a point of seeing this - and for admirers of Van Gogh, it's essential.(I'd love to see the Academy throw this film some love in the Best Animated Feature division, by the way - but you just know they're going to give the ultimate prize to the Big Disney Film Of The Year)."
38,Loving Vincent,7,14 January 2018,the best way to tell Van Gogh.,"They found the best way to tell Van Gogh. I do not know if these films will continue for other painters. But Van Gogh looks very good, a different experience"
39,Loving Vincent,7,14 January 2018,They found the best way to tell Van Gogh.,"They found the best way to tell Van Gogh. I do not know if these films will continue for other painters. But Van Gogh is very well-suited, a different experiment."
40,Loving Vincent,10,12 January 2018,Beautifully Innovative & Sentimental,"When I visited the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam I was unaware of the amount of letters Vincent wrote to his brother, Theo. Throughout the museum were snippets of his letters in both written and audio form. As I read or listened to each one in the midst of some of the best artwork ever created, I became extremely moved by what they revealed about history's most prolific painter. What I learnt was that Vincent was a man who felt deeply; he loved deeply, worried deeply, thought deeply, perhaps a little too much for the mind to bare. 
This film showcases this conflict and I think it does so beautifully and more importantly, respectfully. The artistry achievement alone is astonishing and I don't think I want to watch any other film about Van Gogh if I can't see it through his eyes like you do in Loving Vincent. Not only is this effect innovative & unique, but it heightens the tones of mystery, nostalgia and grief to an exceptionally moving level. 
The morality of the story is overwhelming. Van Gogh was a severely misunderstood pioneer of the creative imagination, an attribute not commonly appreciated by small communities in that context. The success of this often gloomy narrative is due to the evolving mindset of our protagonist played by Douglas Booth. Not only does he eventually come to understand that Van Gogh was a natural at his craft, his character is one that changes from start to end aas he becomes to realize the tragic yet kind person Van Gogh really was. We as an audience are discovering all this with Booth and so by the end, we too are irrevocably moved and inspired by the ever Loving, Vincent."
41,Loving Vincent,6,10 January 2018,an interesting and different biography.,"I expected more from Loving Vincent, unfortunately the animation could not move me, it did not excite me and did not leave me interested in the film, I found a boring movie even though it is a short film, the quality of the animation is incredible, you are watching the Van painting Gogh, is impressive, the voice work is good and competent, is not the best biography of the painter, has better options, but ta far from being a bad movie, worth the quality of animation and can also thrill other people, but unfortunately did not get the movie. Note 6.4"
42,Loving Vincent,8,9 January 2018,a head-turner for both art lovers and cineastes,"The very first fully painted animated feature film, each frame is an oil painting on canvas, using the same technique as Vincent van Gogh (in toto 125 painters are employed), apparently for its sheer workload alone, Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman's sui generis animation picture is a head-turner for both art lovers and cineastes. Concatenating van Gogh's extant works together as the backbone of a post-mortem journey examining Vincent's last days (with flashback in lowering black-and-white to counterpoint the present time's varicolored palette) on the pretense of delivering his final letter to brother Theo, the film consigns the task to a young man Armand Roulin (Booth), and through his encounters with many a Vincent's acquaintance, he becomes increasingly intrigued by the myth cloaking around his apparent suicide, raking through conflicting accounts and forensic evidences, Armand comes to the solution that Vincent is shot by someone else, presumably a local tearaway René Secretin, who habitually bullies Vincent but also profligate in paying tabs for his drinks. But when he finally has a tête-à-tête with Dr. Gachet (Flynn), the man who is the closest associate of Vincent, the theory of murder is outstripped by the painter's sudden capitulation to taedium vitae, maybe the gun wound in his abdomen is not self-inflicted, but it does prompt his resignation to the Grim Reaper after all, an opportune incident to shuffle off this awful mortal coil, leaving 800-plus works behind. The film is a legitimate testament of the often overused filmic rhetoric ""every shot looks like a painting"", because they all are, and what is invigorating (apart from those final products' aesthetic exuberance) to see is the discernible ""moving painting"" flow and movement amongst each frame's transition, as in the stop-motion technique, and it introduces a salutarily animating effect to viewers even the story itself routinely rambling around. Also, a wheeze of applying real actors to enact all the story, pays off by keeping us rapt in looking deeper over their Post-Impressionist masquerade, to savor their acting in a way that is both layered and emphasized (tellingly Douglas Booth is a much eloquent actor with the camouflage), that is, for my money, the mainspring which makes this laboriously confected artifact the bee's knees in the face of its innately nondescript and over-reverent biopic treatment."
43,Loving Vincent,9,7 January 2018,A film that is beautifal as well as compassionate,"Based on true events: In southern France, a year after the death of painter Vincent Van Gogh, Armand Roulin (voiced by Douglas Booth) is assigned to send a letter written by the late Vincent to his brother Theo. During this venture, he discovers many details leading to Vincent's death.""Loving Vincent"" is a Polish-UK animated production and is in the English language.This movie joins many other films and other works on a man who continues to endlessly fascinate many. It is also a very compassionate film that focuses on life's deeper timeless challenges including mental health, concerns of the vulnerable of being a burden to those who are kind, career choices made against one's heart, and the great harm caused by bad parenting. While there remain many stigmas today around mental health, this movie leaves the question: how would Vincent's life have ended up if the society around him knew as much about mental health was we know today?The most praiseworthy aspect of the film is the animated frames which are all oil-painted in Van Gogh's unique style by over a hundred artists. The colours and images are as stunning as the paintings they emulate.While the viewer may never know all of the true details of this part of history, ""Loving Vincent"" provides a wonderful possibility of it. It's an enjoyable mystery as Armand discoveries more clues about the fascinating painter and a very moving film about life as well.""Loving Vincent"" joins a list of other fascinating animated, international co-productions that include ""The Breadwinner"", ""The Red Turtle"", and ""The Illusionist"".OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: the animation"
44,Loving Vincent,9,2 January 2018,Intriguing Movie,"Was he shot or did he kill himself? Why were the people so bad to him? Why did he not want to live somewhere else? Not much is known about the man. What kind of childhood did he have? What was his relationship like with his parents and those around him? Was he infatuated with the daughter of that doctor? What was it that drove him to cut his ear in actuality? Watch this movie to get puzzled and appreciate this interesting painter. The part that I did not like was the depiction of the doctor's wife, who was very terse with him, and appeared as a foul Christian in which I have sensed some anti-religious propaganda. But nonetheless, I suggest you to go and watch this aesthetically pleasing and intriguing movie"
45,Loving Vincent,8,29 December 2017,Shines more light onto the life of the misunderstood painter,"Loving Vincent is a biographical drama film about Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. Being the first fully painted animated film, it is a fascinating and often moving look into the life and death of the world-renowned tormented artist.One year after the suicide of Vincent van Gogh, a young man named Armand (Douglas Booth) travels to the artist's hometown to deliver a letter to Van Gogh's brother, Theo. Upon arrival, Armand learns that Theo has since died from syphilis, and decides to give the letter to Theo's widow instead. On his journey, Armand learns through various stories and anecdotes from the local townspeople about the type of person Vincent van Gogh really was, both positive and negative.Beautifully animated in Van Gogh's distinct art-style, Loving Vincent shines more light onto the life of the misunderstood painter who wanted nothing more than to find his purpose in life. Each frame shows the painstaking effort a team of 125 painters went to illustrate the beautiful and unique way in which Van Gogh likely saw the world. This film makes for a fine entry point for anyone wishing to know more about Van Gogh's life with only a passing knowledge of accomplishments. Douglas Booth does a fine job of playing Armand, someone who knew little about the artist's life but upon research gains a better understanding of the legacy he has left behind.I rate it 8/10"
46,Loving Vincent,9,8 December 2017,sort of like a watchable version of WAKING LIFE,"LOVING VINCENT is undoubtedly a work of art with startling imagery, excellent performances, and a nicely informative bend on history, approaching Van Gogh's final years as an unfolding murder mystery. It's difficult to review movies like this as there really weren't many flaws to speak of, other than there being a few of the longer and landscape shots where the artwork feels a bit too crude to make out too well.As far as the character art and close-ups, the film really shines, managing to incorporate most of Van Gogh's most famous pieces into the narrative. Not only will this movie appeal to fans of the man's art, but likely will create a new generation of fans by making it all more accessible and adding an emotionally resonant backstory to what otherwise would be viewed as just nice looking portraits of random people.I couldn't help but feel a lot of comparison to some other rotoscoped films like SCANNER DARKLY and WAKING LIFE, especially with the otherworldly tone granted to the film by the visual style. To my eye, it's far better looking than WAKING LIFE and has a much more compelling narrative, even if it really boils down to a similar series of interviews. Hats off to all of those involved for the many painstaking years of combined work to put this together. It's a shame that films like this don't find a larger audience but a minor miracle that they manage to get made considering the economics of the industry these days."
47,Loving Vincent,,6 December 2017,Quite good!,"Uh, this one is so hard to rate!I always usually give the rating and start the review but with this film, I am not sure how to rate.First, I love Van Gogh's paintings. His paintings are an explosion of color when you see them for the 1st time and I will never ever forget the day I saw my first paintings by Van Gogh!So, it was really really interesting to see all the paintings I know come alive in this film. The work is amazing! Really, if I could give rating 100 for the animation/painting I would.As for the film, it is what it is for the film that wants to explain last 2/3 days of his life. I find it interesting that it does go in a sense of some kind of Agatha Christi's mystery with 'Van Gogh's Poirot'... But there is not really a mystery after all - not the one like in true mystery films...Loving Vincent is really loving homage to him.I guess at the end this would get 8 from me."
48,Loving Vincent,7,1 December 2017,A nice comforting film to fall asleep to.,"'LOVING VINCENT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)'LOVING VINCENT' is the first fully painted animated feature film! It was created by a team of 115 painters, all using the same technique as Vincent van Gogh, to create every frame of the movie as an oil painting on canvas. The film is a biographical drama, all about the life, and in particular the death, of legendary painter Vincent van Gogh. It was written and directed by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman (with Jacek Dehnel also serving as a screenwriter). The movie features the voice talents of Douglas Booth, Chris O'Dowd, Eleanor Tomlinson, Saoirse Ronan, Aidan Turner, Jerome Flynn, John Sessions, Helen McCrory and Robert Gulaczyk (as Van Gogh). It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards as well. I found the visuals to be very interesting, and the story too, but the movie itself is mostly a bore.The story begins one year after the death of Vincent van Gogh (Gulaczyk), apparently from suicide. Postman Roulin (O'Dowd) asks his son Armand (Booth) to deliver Van Gogh's last written letter to his brother, after multiple attempts to mail it failed. Armand does as his father asks, even though he didn't especially like Van Gogh, but he knows his dad was a big fan of his. Roulin is also suspicious about the cause of the painter's death, and he blames the townspeople for harassing and alienating the mentally ill artist. While trying to deliver the letter, Armand ends up interviewing multiple different people that knew Van Gogh, about his death. He begins to have more questions about the legendary artist's mysterious passing, and unusual life, than answers. The movie is of course always visually interesting to look at, although the animation method would have been better used on a film with a more visually striking story to tell. This film is made up of extremely long dialogue scenes, so the visuals are mostly just of people (and especially long shots of their faces). While the life, and death, and mental illness of Van Gogh is extremely fascinating, it could have been used to make a much more interesting movie than this. This film is excruciatingly slow-paced. I kept nodding off during it, even after I took a caffeine pill, and I rarely ever do that. It is a nice comforting film to fall asleep to, I guess though, and I honestly mean that as a compliment.Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us"
49,Loving Vincent,7,30 November 2017,Really liking if not quite loving Vincent,"Vincent Van Gogh was a fine artist with a distinctive visual style. His personal life was also an interesting one and lends itself well to film.'Loving Vincent' was an interesting film. It is an uneven and flawed film but it is also very beautiful, thoughtful and emotional, as well as having one of the most innovative visual styles of any film personally seen. It is very easy to see why a lot will like, and even love (like many have done here), 'Loving Vincent'. Can also see why others may be frustrated by it, despite the visuals and emotional impact it is wanting biographically and while it didn't bother me at all the slow pace may test people.Would have liked for 'Loving Vincent' to have focused more on his life, which is substantial and intriguing enough to fill a film, and less on the interesting and thought-provoking but fairly speculative and controversial conspiracy theories with artistic license that will frustrate purists and historians.Most of the script is fine but runs out of steam a little too early, which makes the conclusion not quite as satisfying as it could have been (no matter how tear-jerking one feels after the film is over). Some of the rotoscopic technique doesn't quite gel.On the other hand, 'Loving Vincent' is mostly visually stunning and stylistically it stands out in a unique way. The oil painting animation is so rich in detail and a feast for the eyes that it's enough to make the jaw drop, the distinctive psychological rawness of the painting style captivating. The black and white flashbacks are almost classic film film-noir-like, and are not just beautifully shot in their own way but they are handled and meshed very neatly. The music score is both haunting and soothing.The script is mostly thought-provoking and intelligent, never stilted or rambling. The story is deliberate but the melancholic tone is genuinely poignant and offers a lot of insight, even if it could have been more focused. The characters intrigue and carry the story well and they are well performed, even by Douglas Booth who tends to leave me indifferent.In short, really liked 'Loving Vincent' but it fell a little short of me loving it. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
50,Loving Vincent,10,29 November 2017,The mystery of Vincent van Gogh's death explained in all its unfathomable tragedy,"This is a very remarkable and impressing film made almost like a detective story searching out the truth behind Vincent van Gogh's death by a shot in his belly. It is based entirely on his paintings and is actually like a cartoon film made of his paintings, while the characters, who are all genuine and existed in reality, are impersonated by actors by their voices, and it is expertly done - couldn't have been done better.The chief character is the son of Vincent's postman, who is entrusted with the task of delivering Vincent's last letter to his brother, whom Armand Roulin, the postman's son, doesn't know is already dead. He interviews people who were in touch with Vincent and who he lived with, ending up with doctor Gachet, who provides the final solution to the mystery. I don't think there has been made a film like this before with the ambition to explain the whole situation, but here it is done thoroughly convincingly. No question marks remain as the full tragedy appears in all its pathetic regrettability and loss, unnecessarily, of a great genius.The solution to the mystery will not be revealed here, but it appears quite clearly and rather soon that van Gogh impossibly could have shot himself in the belly. Someone else must have fired the shot, but who and why? That is the mystery. Or was it just an accident, but how could then such an accident be explained? There have been various other van Gogh films made before, and the best is probably still the Kirk Douglas version based on Irving Stone's famous novel, while other films have fallen flat. This is probably the version that comes closest to ""the true story"", although, naturally, Vincent's character appears slightly romanticized and brushed up."
51,Loving Vincent,9,25 November 2017,Unlike any other film,"I had read about the making of this film last year - and I was so thrilled with seeing the results. Many reviews above have given the whole story so I won't. The artistry of the film is the most unusual and beautiful I have seen. The work of the artists who produced the 65,000 shots for the film - unbelievable and so beautiful. The story is sad and well told - and the artistry of the film is Oscar worthy. Made by two countries it is a beautiful collaboration."
52,Loving Vincent,8,25 November 2017,A visually stunning look into how he suffered for his sanity,"Focusing the last days of Vincent Van Gogh & his life briefly, this visually striking film actually looked like a continuous series of live oil paintings of VVG that somehow came to life with words! This tremendous achievement for live action animation genre surely is a treat to watch not only for the fans of the Father of modern art but also whoever is fond of different sort of animated films & art. Purely influenced by the works that Van Gogh had painted & using his same painting technique, each of the frame of the film (in total 65K!) is actually an oil painting on canvas, created by a team of more than 100 painters (source: The Making of Loving Vincent video & wiki)! The film also heavily revolves around the mystery surrounding the suicidal death of this troubled genius and that gave it kind of a feel of a mystery movie also. Not in a first person perspective, rather as point of view from the others who were somewhat close to him or observed him more or less closely, the film tries to captures the tragic life of a bullied & struggling Vincent, considered a madman and a failure, had a very unpleasant relationship with fame & fate during his lifetime as they never collided till long after his death. But the way the basic narrative was set in the film, it won't be as much appealing if they made it only as a live action film without this unique style of animation. So Vincent's own style of art, contributed by more than hundred of modern classical-painters saved this film and made it something very special. And last but not the least, a film about Vincent Vang Gogh would never be complete without Don McLean's one of the most moving & best songs ever...Vincent (Starry Starry Night). Though they should have added the original version but glad at least they added a cover version of it at the end credits.♪ Now I understand What you tried to say to me And how you suffered for your sanity And how you tried to set them free They would not listen, they did not know how Perhaps they'll listen now ♪ ♫"
53,Loving Vincent,8,23 November 2017,Transports you to the world of Van Gogh,"WHAT an amazing movie! Unique in every way. It is not a movie at all one could argue, it's ""Art in motion"". Not any art but Vincent Van Gogh's art! This movie literally transported me to the world of Vincent Van Gogh and how he would have perceived the world. Very innovative to use his artwork to generate characters, I loved it.The only problem I experienced was that I often got caught in the artwork and lost my focus from the story line. Will have to watch it again. Well done to everyone involved."
54,Loving Vincent,8,18 November 2017,A Piece Of Art🖌🎼,"Loving Vincent is the world's first fully painted feature film. The story which I genuinely didn't expect to be that good, it's about a man comes to the painter Vincent hometown to deliver his final letter in his final days.This film was outstandingly beautiful, I'm a person who admires art in any kind and when I heard about this film I was so happy I thought that it will be a good film but was it only that ? Absolutely NOT this is the most beautiful film I've seen, When I saw the film I was exciting but I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT THAT ! The film was A PIECE OF ART truly speaking this film was incredible.When I was watching the film every scene that passes by I try to forget the fact that it's painted by HAND ! Just to focus on the story alone and forget about the incredible work that those painter's made but I really couldn't it was so fascinating to look at and the fact that I'm a person who likes art and artists, once in my life I was trying to be one I was just blown away from the work of the painter's it was just mesmerizing. The way you feel of as these are real people it was just spectacular. The music oh yes the music, music is maybe my number one thing that I look forward to in a film because music could tell you a story it could move you in a certain way and the music in this film was composed by Clint Mansell which happens to be one of my favorite composer's of all time alongside just Hans Zimmer and Max Richter, I LOVED his music in The Fountain, Black Swan, Moon and Requiem For A Dream films, and in Loving Vincent I loved his work even more, he made the film just beautiful with his amazing music. I'm honestly still at a kind of disbelief of the beauty of that film and the reality that it was hand painted, I don't have anything more to say except to truly thank everyone who worked at this masterpiece yes A MASTERPIECE I said it."
55,Loving Vincent,9,18 November 2017,A tribute to everything Van Gogh,"Life of Vincent Van Gogh portrayed using oil paintings of his own style. Loving Vincent is a tribute to the one of the greatest painter through worlds first completely oil painted animated film. Through the traditional narrative of the finding of the dead protagonist's life, this proved to be a heartfelt drama. Taking more than 7 years with 100s of artists what is achieved here is something overwhelming. The acting is translated into the canvas with such efficaciousness that the beauty of it keeps you transfixed."
56,Loving Vincent,9,18 November 2017,Beautiful,"This is an exquisitely beautiful film. A film which hinges on the conceit of Vincent's paintings speaking to each other about Vincent. It is a respectful, heartfelt tribute to the painter, and deals with his short life and tragic death in a sympathetic and sensitive way.A moving, stunningly visual film which will delight anybody who has a nodding acquaintance with the artist's works. But for those who are fans of Vincent it is even more. It is an evocation of his dreams, a parade of familiar scenes and a recreation of the ethos of Vincent, the greatest painter to have ever lived."
57,Loving Vincent,10,18 November 2017,Van Gogh is a loved one,"I saw the movie yesterday and i know it will be (because it was) the most remarkable film to me. Not just because i adore Vincent but also because it's all perfect. The image, the sound, the characters and even the computing animation' are just brilliant. I have always known that Van Gogh is a name in History, and maybe this movie can make people thing that history is culture and culture is artLoving Filipe"
58,Loving Vincent,10,17 November 2017,One of a Kind,"This is an astonishing feat. When animated shorts are nominated for Academy Awards, they frequently run 10 to 15 minutes. How a group of artists were able to ""paint"" the scenes and incorporate great paintings into a really fine story of full movie length is beyond my comprehension. Van Gogh is dead and so is his brother, Theo. It is thought that he took his own life for whatever reason. Lord knows he had enough issues, including his utter genius. A family friend is dispatched to deliver a last letter from the great artist to his brother, but when the friend arrives, he find Theo is dead. This guy has his own issues and at first tires of his task, but when he finds that there is some suspicious stuff relating to the ""suicide,"" he becomes entrenched in solving the case. A running theme is that Van Gogh had no weight because of his lack of commercial success and, beside that, he was weird. As the friend gets into the case, we get to know that there were people who cared about him and liked him, but they also didn't do much to hold him up. As others have said, this is an amazing expression of the painter''s world, put before us through his paintings. One other thing. Don't leave the theater too soon because there are some great closing items that one shouldn't miss."
59,Loving Vincent,8,17 November 2017,A visually amazing tribute to the founder of modern art,"I've never seen a film that looks like this one. As I understand it, the film was shot using the actors whose voices speak the lines of the animated images. A team of about 125 professional oil painters painted a reported 853 paintings in the style of Vincent van Gogh. These were used in various ways to provide each individual still frame of the film, of which there are over 65,000. The paintings were filmed and animated to bring the action and story to life. It is visually absolutely breathtaking, an amazing tribute to the painter generally credited as the founder of modern art.The story is set a year after the artist's death, when the postman who collected Vincent's nearly daily correspondence asks his layabout son Armand to hand deliver the artist's last letter, addressed to his brother Theo. He eventually sets off to the village of Auvers-sur- Oise, where the artist died. He becomes increasing fascinated by the circumstances of Vincent's death, and talks to nearly all of the people who had direct knowledge or perpetuated rumours of the events. Many of these people are subjects in Vincent's paintings, and so the film has an astounding quality of bringing familiar characters to life. The narrative is not totally satisfactory, but the visualisation more than makes up for this. The variety of voices of actors from various parts of the UK works, and I concluded that having the characters speaking French with subtitles would have removed the freedom to look at the visual scenes all the time, detracting from the visual impression. I suppose it has been dubbed for release in non English speaking countries. I wasn't familiar with many of the actors, but Chris O'Dowd as the postman Joseph Roulin sounded comfortably familiar, and his characteristic jerky and slightly awkward movement patterns were faithfully represented in the postman's animated movements around the scenes. It doesn't hold back from the intensity of Vincent's life, and is the stronger for this.The film, directed by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman took nearly a decade to make, and I just hope that the amazing effort of the team is rewarded with a reasonable commercial outcome. Go see it and help them along."
60,Loving Vincent,,17 November 2017,A piece of art,"This film tells the story of a young man who is drawn to investigating the circumstances of Vincent van Gogh's death from a gunshot wound.It is an innovative way to make a film, as all frames are oil paintings. They didn't even superimpose a moving character onto a static background, but they draw over the painting to make the characters move. I can't even imagine how many hours it must have taken the artists. The plot is engaging as it does into the mystery of Vincent's death. It is a great piece of art, and it's worth the watch."
61,Loving Vincent,10,15 November 2017,Like nothing you've ever seen,"Van Gogh's painting style is captured magnificently and is the selling point of the film. The story is a DATELINE-esque narrative of the people and situations that may have contributed to Van Gogh's death. The first time I saw it, I did think it was a little slow. But I went again with a friend and it was even better the second time. I noticed more details, and understood the impact of certain characters more. The closing song adds an emotional punch - best use of an end-credits song since TITANIC."
62,Loving Vincent,9,4 November 2017,The most amazing animated movie I've ever seen!,"The story talks a man who is in charge to deliver a letter to Vincent Van Gogh's brother Theo but when he found that Theo is dead, he involves in a adventure to find why Van Gogh killed himself. I loved the fact that the movie was painted by professional painters with the technique of Van Gogh which gave to the film a personal touch. Plus, the story was very captivating and interesting, involving a lot of mystery and suspense which catch the audience's attention. The most well 95 minutes spent on cinema."
63,Loving Vincent,1,16 November 2017,BOREDOM at its FINEST!!! (for a rational adult),"Monotonous, very far from being creative let alone being interesting. (I got bored at credits and more boredom ensued then on). Try and see if you can get past 10 minutes without fast forwarding, which leads to even more intense boredom. I appreciate the effort but maybe it should have been a short movie, more to the point and with much more punch."
64,Loving Vincent,8,10 November 2017,Canvases Are Windows Not Doors,"When a humble Dutch painter dies under a set of precarious village stories, an impromptu detective vacations in the artist's final inn. This amateur sleuth is the son of the postman that shepherded the letters of Van Gogh. When a final undelivered letter arises, the gray beard passes the duty off to his bar fight prone son.The letter's contents are preserved in obscurity, and only the recipient is known. The brother of Van Gogh has an endless gap of correspondence that the young Armand has been commissioned to fill. A simple delivery soon transpires into an entangling film noir melodrama. Lies fly loose in this homey countryside community. Everyone wishes to claim a piece of the genius. Some deny connection altogether. Armand does not have any horses in the race beside his unquenchable thirst for truth. A pursuit that leads to innkeeper flings and drunken tussles.A film that dissects its subject in the most honest form, oil oozes character, and scrapes define setting. The toil of over 100 artist and 853 establishing paintings leave an undeniable mark of care. Each frame speaks to the playful tinkering that brought still figures to live.A celebration of Van Gogh's tumultuous life, and an examination of his curious demise, the postmortem play chooses to remember the painter in unassuming vignettes and ordinary tasks. A man burdened by finances and plagued by aristocratic contemporaries, he weaved about a drab lifestyle with obsessive dedication to his craft.Van Gogh could turn the most ordinary into a fascinating exploration of form and expression. His rain-soaked canvases tell a tale of uncompromising devotion when the world punished legacy creators. His death marked the greatest ""what if"" in art history, a question that will spark a dangerous journey for Armand."
65,Loving Vincent,4,26 November 2017,Not loving this film,"I just don't get this film. I can't stand the regional British accents. Just do it in a standard accent or better French mixed with Flemish if needed. The animated style was pointless and distracting, especially a mustard yellow jacket that made me want to vomit, but I imagine it took hours, allowing the costume, sets and acting departments to then take it easy.I'm not a super fan of Vincent's art, but I still find him an interesting personality and I'd like to watch a movie that explored this further. This film was simply boring chat with animation over the top, I gave up after an hour. I can't understand why it scores so highly on IMDb."
66,Loving Vincent,8,19 November 2017,Beauty or Headache? Depends,"This film accomplishes such a feat of animation that I feel like a heel making the following statement: at times I just felt an overwhelming need to hit *pause* so I could re-settle my overstimulated senses. If Van Gogh actually saw nature around him in these patterns, I have no reason to doubt why he would go a little (or a lot) looney. The blending and sifting from image to image or even within one image, is profoundly impressive. Yet it also is so constant that I felt a serious headache and nausea coming on. Perhaps that is just my own physical failing but it hope it can be but a warning to others."
67,Loving Vincent,10,17 November 2017,Remarkable Love Letter to a Even More Remarkable Painter,"Beginning from the credits, rolling in front of a beautifully animated Starry Night, this film was- first and foremost- a work of art. There is a story, yes. A very educational mystery, in fact, that held me in suspense. I was aware of how Van Gogh supposedly died, but never the puzzling details surrounding his supposed suicide in 1890. What really happened to him? Did he commit suicide? He seemed to be doing fine. How was his doctor involved? His brother? The doctor's daughter who is as beautiful as she is evasive with answering questions surrounding the relationship with the painter? Van Gogh chops off his ear, gifts it to a prostitute, then shows up at the hotel he is staying at, shot in the stomach. He claims he tried to commit suicide, but is this the truth? Could he be protecting someone instead? He was a shy, rough man in his early thirties that had no formal training, but had somehow made it. A genius of an artist that was at the height of his career, there was little reason for his suicide. He had some mental health problems but had been feeling better. He had a somewhat unprofessionally friendly relationship with his doctor whom he visited at his home. There might have been financial problems, as evidenced by his correspondence with his brother Theo. The script is based on these real-life letters. In the summer of 1891, shortly after Vincent Van Gough's death, the protagonist Armand Roulin is given a letter by his father, the local postman. The keep was written by the artist, addressed to his brother. Armand has been given instructions to delivery this letter by hand. He soon finds out that its intended recipient had also recently died. But this is not a film you watch for the story. The paintings come alive, one brush stroke at a time; paintings I recognize from the little exposure I have had to the artist. As a small example, I would feel like I was looking at a gorgeous painting when suddenly the rain would begin to move, smoke would move from a pipe. Every scene with a light was animated to look like the stars in Starry Night, i.e. nightlights would have the curls around it. How awesome is that? 65,000 frames, hand-painted by hundreds of individual hands. This was a work of love, a work from the heart. You can no doubt see this as you watch the film unfold, a tribute to a genius. Be sure to watch the credits, which compare the original Vincent Van Gogh paintings with the actors and animated versions. Depending on the voice actors, characters can really be completely different. I felt the choices for the voice actors in this film were excellent. They made the animation come alive. They all used French pronunciations, making it very believable. Loved the monochrome scenes, all flashbacks. A perfect artistic choice, considering there were obviously no paintings to document these earlier years. As for the title, Van Gough often signed his letters, ""Your loving Vincent"". Aside from the play on words, that is. According to a press release, ""Loving Vincent"" was first shot as a live action film with actors who worked on sets specially constructed to look like Van Gogh paintings, or against green- screens. Then this reference footage was used to hand-paint the film frame-by-frame in oils. The final effect is an interaction of the performance of the actors playing Vincent's famous portraits, and the performance of the painting animators, bringing these characters into the medium of paint. A well-told narrative that felt like an animated, artistic documentary. For more on this magnificent treat for the eyes, I found myself losing a few hours here: http://lovingvincent.com So what do we have here? 125 painters, 180 hours required training each, 10 days per 1 second of film, 65,000 frames, 6500 tubes + 1300 liters of Royal Talens paint, 7 years, 1 extraordinary film."
68,Loving Vincent,10,15 November 2017,Unique and new achievement in animation,"Loving Vincent is a remarkable film that vividly brings the paintings and last years of Vincent Van Gogh to life. Every frame has been lovingly and painstakingly oil painted, and the animation connecting them all is amazing in its artistry. The storyline, characters, and setting are compelling and historically accurate. You feel immersed in 19th century France. The film cleverly casts actors for the historical characters from Van Gogh's paintings and life and melds them together with beautiful animation. The film lives up to its muse and then some."
69,Loving Vincent,7,9 January 2018,"Mediocre editing, poor scenario, excellent visuals.","If we can evaluate a film according to the sum of each item, it is absolutely impossible to be at a level above the average. Because the film speaks too much but it does not make much sense. It is a great film if you only talk about the size of the experiment and the technique and technique on it. But I am not sure that it is right to use an evaluation technique like this. But it still deserves a certain place because of his respect for artistic attitude and artistry."
70,Loving Vincent,5,18 December 2017,"Great movie process, lack of movement, and action.","Lovely and painstaking process to get this movie done. Being all made by paints deserve just by itself an oscar of labour and skills. Its fantastic to see the brushes moving and the lines, the faces waving. Lovely story, but as the movies goes on, we lost the first uau effect, and the lack of movement and action kills a bit the awesomeness of this movie."
