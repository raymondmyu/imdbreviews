0,Monster House,9,2 August 2006,This movie caught me by surprise,"Monster House was a perfect combination of kid-friendliness, horror, action and adventure. When I first walked into the theater I thought it would be ""kiddy"" because I went to see it with my younger cousin. You know how most animated movies are somewhat funny and about teamwork and working together or teaches life lessons or morals but I actually came to find that this movie was more scary than comical or ethical. I actually got into it. I actually ended up liking it more than my cousin. Some of the content is for older kids but it's non-stop action and the momentum of the story line never stops. And the characters seem so real. 2 thumbs up. I definitely recommend it."
1,Monster House,8,6 July 2006,Scary fun,"Well, I think if I saw this movie when I was ten years old, I would have been totally scared and could not sleep for weeks. Now it seems time has changed: ten-year-old children are playing horror-video games so probably what was too scary for them in the eighties is just right and fun now. Actually this is just what you could expect from a movie about a monster house: funny, spectacular, sometimes frightening. Quite a well-developed story - even if it is full of clichés, or should I say homage? - with the usual ""two boys, one girl"" trio as seen in Star Wars or Harry Potter. The animation is strange at first: they seem like rubber dummies, but thanks to the motion capture, their movement and expressions are first rate. While they look like having plastic hair, there is a great development since Polar Express in one field: their eyes are constantly moving - full of life. And the whole movie is just a typical and fun Spielberg-Zemeckis production with elements of Hitchcock. Besides the extraordinarily dark scenes it just feels like those very entertaining Spielberg productions of the eighties."
2,Monster House,8,16 June 2006,Quite the enjoyable movie!,"I just saw this movie at the Seattle International Film Festival. I didn't know what to expect, but I must say I found it quite enjoyable. There was a lot of talk before the movie. People were saying that it will be too scary for the little kids, but not adult enough to capture older kids attention.I can see it being quite frightening at times for the little ones, but of the kids in the theater its not like I heard any of them screaming mommy. I don't know how well the movie will do with kids, but from an adult's perspective, its definitely worth a viewing.The best part of the movie definitely has to be the characters. Each were extremely well thought out and put together. They did a fantastic job of matching right voices with the right characters. Characters facial expressions were amazing. You'll find yourself laughing at things they say and do quite a lot.The animation looks great. They certainly aren't ground breaking. But they fit the movie well. However, I will say that some scenes looked quite amazing.If you are looking for a fun, clean movie with plenty of laughs and chuckles, this is definitely one you don't want to miss!"
3,Monster House,9,28 July 2006,A trio of preteens must work together to conquer the frightening house across the street when they discover that it is alive.,"Let's be clear - Monster House is not your typical 'feel-good' children's movie. That isn't to say, however, that there are never any points where the viewer is allowed to feel good. In fact, I discovered, despite my initial resistance to a movie that I thought would simply impress me graphically, copious moments of warmth and humor within the unembellished and utterly human actions of the characters. This is the movie's paramount success. Not the plot, the myriad celebrity voices, or even the decisively unique and dazzling computer animation. Where Monster House really shines is within the dialogue and behavior of its perfectly believable personalities. From the girl-musings and growing pains of the pubescent DJ and Chowder to the cantankerous rantings of their crotchety old neighbor Nebbercracker, the cast is so natural that one would expect to run across such people within day-to-day life. It is this element that helps Monster House transcend an entirely surreal plot to make an idea so bizarre and twisted seem entirely real. It is true that Monster House does contain a predominantly dark theme, with a considerable amount of eerie scenes to support it. I don't believe, however, that this should keep it from being shared with children, especially those preadolescences that will soon enough be able to relate to the emotions and actions of its protagonists. As long as younger children have the guidance of a parent or other compassionate adult, this film has the potential be viewed and adored by all ages."
4,Monster House,8,26 August 2006,A Nutshell Review: Monster House,"In almost any neighbourhood, there is always that one house, or that unit of apartment, which has spiritual connotations attached to it. It could be because of tragedy, or rumours, or just for the simple reason that it's unoccupied, or has some elderly, probably unkindly, strange looking old folk living in it, that gives the creeps to anyone under the age of 10.In Monster House, it uses a familiar urban legend, and plays up the nastiness associated with such a location. DJ (Mitchel Musso) stays opposite a creepy looking house, and bears witness, through his telescope, of the things that go bump in the night, and the horrible things that it does. Natually, because he's a kid, nobody believes him, save for good friend cum resident fat-kid loser Chowder (Sam Lerner).The story's kept tight by having set a day before Halloween, and despite the children being stereotyped, Chowder actually stole the show from DJ with his at time innocent, at time crafty and sly antics, and there's a nice tango for attention between the two boys and their crush of the moment - Jenny (Spenser Locke). So while the three of them get set to unravel the mystery of the Monster House, it doesn't disappoint, with the bickering, laughs and budding romance, chemistry like that between Potter, Ron and Hermione. Hmm.. now that I mentioned, it looked more like a Harry Potter clone.The graphics require some getting used to, given that it's deliberately not done in a cutesy manner, thereby coming across at times as quite stiff. Come to think of it, there isn't an artificially created ""cute"" character in the movie, as it adapts ""real life"" as best as it could, in an animated form. And for a horror movie, it put its real life counterparts to shame, especially in its anticipatory build up in mood and atmosphere.Anyway, the trailer doesn't give much away except to whet your appetites, so I'll keep it at that rather than to inadvertently reveal any surprises. And if you're undecided between the two animated flicks on offering this week at the local cinemas, then my advice would be to pick Monster House over Barnyard. Here, the story is clearer superior. And that's what matters, really."
5,Monster House,10,24 July 2006,Awesome Movie!,"Spectacular visuals, unforgettable characters, and a fairy tale story with a twist! Highly recommend the Real D 3-D version if available in your area.Movie was scary, funny, dramatic and entertaining all at once. However, some parts of the movie may be a little too scary for kids 8 and under. For grown ups that still try to catch every episode of SpongeBob, this is it!The Real D 3-D version added to the movie going experience. I didn't experience fatigue or dizziness for the entirety of the movie -- which was more common in previous 3-D movie technology. When I saw the beginning of the end credits, the experience just leaves you begging for more -- but for now, I know that desire can be satisfied by watching this movie again in the near future."
6,Monster House,8,16 June 2006,"The story is the key to the movie, and it's very good.","Looking out his window, DJ (Mitchel Musso) sees a creepy-looking house (Kathleen Turner). It's owned by Mr Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi), who really doesn't want people on his lawn. Toys that end up there disappear, taken by Nebbercracker to discourage trespassing. DJ catalogs the lost items, but his parents (Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard) aren't interested in his observations of the house. Just before Halloween, his parents leave him home, in the care of babysitter Elizabeth (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who prefers the nickname ""Z"". His friend ""Chowder"" (Sam Lerner) visits, and joins his observation of the house. They spot Jenny (Spencer Locke, who is a girl whose parents stuck her with a boy's name) about to try to sell Halloween candy to Nebbercracker, and hurry to talk her out of approaching the house. Before long, they discover that Nebbercracker isn't the only thing that's creepy about the house. The house, it seems, has a life of its own.This movie started as a script that sat unproduced for years, for want of technology and the right people to make it. The technology that went into it turned out to be the same sort of animation as _The Polar Express_, digital animation based on motion capture. Like _Polar_, it has a stylized look rather than attempting photorealism, but instead of taking the look of paintings in a book, it took the look of extremely detailed dolls and doll accessories. But with motion capture driving the movements of the characters, they end up with a lot of personality, which overrides their stylized look. The animation is least effective in the climax scene at the end, where it exaggerates the action just a bit too far for my tastes, but even there it's pretty good. Most of the time the animation is excellent, with just the right degree of exaggeration to fit the stylized look. The sets are very good, particularly a construction site near the house. I'd rate the animation very good.More important than the technology is the story. What really makes the images on the screen interesting is the way they serve the story. Comparing with _The Polar Express_ again highlights the point -- this movie had a solid story, compared with _Polar_, which expanded a very thin children's book into a feature-length story. This movie's story isn't in a class with the best of Pixar, but the film-makers are clearly aware of the fact that the strength of the story is very important. I'd rate the story very good.The voice and motion capture performances, shot in only 34 days, are almost all excellent. My favorite was Maggie Gyllenhaal, who was wonderful in her supporting part as babysitter ""Z"". The least satisfying, I thought, was Jon Heder (as video-game master ""Skull""), and he was good, just not great. Even Kathleen Turner, as the house, performed in the motion capture space, moving around in a neighborhood constructed of foam. I really hope that the director wasn't joking when he said he might include her motion capture video as a DVD extra. Nick Cannon, as a rookie police officer, was probably the funniest character, relative to his screen time.Kathleen Turner's presence in the cast is a bit of a nod to executive producer Robert Zemeckis, who cast her as Jessica Rabbit in _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_. She was thrilled by the part, which gave her a grotesque role to mirror her glamorous role as Jessica Rabbit. Other Zemeckis references are more obvious. Most obvious one is in the opening, featuring a leaf. Another deals with a basketball -- originally an accident during production. Others may exist, but it's not packed with pop culture references like the _Shrek_ movies.Directing an animated film is different in a lot of ways from directing live action, which makes it more complicated to rate. Directing this movie involved directing both the motion capture performances and the camera positioning. The director took the script, and made complete storyboards from it. From those, he made an animatic, which guided the way he directed the motion capture shoot. Because of the way character interactions affected the results, he said that he ended up throwing out all the storyboarding, but I'd guess he meant that figuratively. The character interaction looked really good, better than almost any animated movie I've seen. I'd rate the directing excellent, in a class with Pixar.Overall, I'd rate the movie very good, mostly on the strength of the story. Kids are usually easy to please, and they'll probably find the movie excellent. Adults are harder to please. Where _Shrek_ emphasizes pop culture references for adult appeal, this movie targets adults' memories of childhood, effectively drawing adults into enjoying it like the kids in the audience.Credits: There are a few additional scenes after the credits begin. Don't run out right away. Stick around at least until the fine-print credits roll.Personal appearances: The director, Gil Kenan, and a couple of the producers (I don't know which ones, but not Spielberg or Zemeckis) were there. The director took questions from the audience, and answered very enthusiastically -- he seemed like he was thrilled to see his film in front of a real audience, and not burned out from hearing the same questions over and over. He was really nice to the kids in the audience, and behaved like he was new to the experience of being the center of attention. He signed lots of autographs (including one for me), and seemed genuinely pleased that people cared enough to ask. That's a reaction that one might expect for the director of something obscure, but uncommonly nice for the director of a big-budget summer movie.The US rating is ""PG"", for some scary scenes and (supposedly) ""crude humor and brief language"". The crude humor is minimal, compared to typical movies aimed at kids. I can't think of any inappropriate language."
7,Monster House,8,21 July 2006,3D Makes All the Difference....,"First of all, let me establish that I have never been impressed by the 3D process. The best that I had previously seen was ""Ghosts of the Abyss"", but there were still too many glitches for my eye to really buy into the process. I never had a chance to see ""Polar Express"" in 3D, but wasn't really anxious too because of my previous lackluster responses to the 3D experience. Then came ""Monster House""....I have NEVER seen anything like this before. The story itself is entertaining and very reminiscent of the type of movie that Steven Spielberg would have made in the early 80's, but the 3D element makes it an EVENT! If you have a choice to see this in a regular theater or in 3D, do not hesitate to see it 3D! From the moment the title comes on screen, I knew I was going to see a level of realism in the 3D process that I had never experienced before. In fact, seeing ""Monster House"" in a regular theater might be akin to seeing all of ""The Wizard of Oz"" in black and white. It would severely diminish the potential impact of the film. ""Monster House"" was obviously envisioned as a 3D experience and the technical process envelopes you in the story and the world in which it takes place in a way that is so immediate and palpable.Lest you think that only the technique is worthy of praise, let me mention that the script, the performances, the direction, the score are all of the fun, adventurous spirit of all the best movies I remember from my youth. It has the feel of ""E.T."", ""The Goonies"", even a little bit of ""Poltergeist"", just a lot more kid-friendly. The movie isn't extraordinary, but it's a heck of a lot of fun. So a giddy 8 stars for the movie, but an enthused 10 stars for the experience. PLEASE, do yourself the favor of seeing this on a 3D screen!"
8,Monster House,8,18 July 2006,"I would take some kids, and a few adults","I saw this film as part of a free screening I took my little sister to and was ready for an immature piece of fluff. Preparing for restless children making bathroom trips and throwing an occasional tantrum overshadowing a mediocre movie I was happily proved wrong. Too many CG-generated films ride on the spectacle of the animation technique keeping audiences in awe while forgoing story. While jaws drop at impossible camera angles and while 3-D rendered characters being stretched in a 2-D way we all play spot/ear the celebrity voice. The Dennis Leary as a ladybug joke can only be taken so far. Perhaps a bar is being set by Pixar to work from an entertaining script like ""The Incredibles"" that would make an good movie no matter how it was made. Drawing from the neighborhood ghost story and a dash of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Shunned House"" Amblin delivered an entertaining popcorn movie that ranges in age appeal. The humor could have easily fallen into stereotypical characters, the familiarity of the story, and bathroom laughs, but maintains irony and, while not naive, maintains a reverence for the innocence of the characters and no doubt much of the young audience. This is a popcorn movie, no doubt, and not every gag is spot on, but it makes for a good matinée and a pretty good introduction to horror movies for a younger crowd. As a fan of animation I walked into a second-run screening of ""The Iron Giant"" and loved it. For me seeing a good movie outside of hype is a lot of fun. I know my expectations were low and the movie was free but I thought it was pretty cool."
9,Monster House,8,6 December 2006,"Entertaining, But Not For The Real Little Ones","I guess you could label this an ""edgy animated film."" It's certainly wasn't made with little kids in mind. If it was, that was a mistake because this a pretty scary film in parts - much to much for the little ones.The ""edginess"" isn't just the violence (a Halloween-type scary house and the comes alive and attacks people), it's most of the characters. They are typical Hollywood-young people meaning they have ""attitudes."" They aren't exactly sweet, lovable people, except for the one young boy ""D.J."" (voiced by Mitchel Musso). The dialog on the kids - two boys, the babysitter and her boyfriend - make this more of a film for teens and younger adults. The ""attitude"" means wise-remarks and general obnoxiousness and rebellious attitudes. The worst in that attitude category is D.J.'s friend ""Chowder,"" the kind of guy who talks you into doing things that wind up getting YOU in trouble.The best part of the film, besides the animation, is the unpredictability of the story. You kept wondering what was going to happen next. That made the 91 minutes go by pretty fast. It's a simple story but very entertaining despite the not-so-great-role models and, as most pictures do, has a good message and a few heartwarming scenes at the end."
10,Monster House,,8 August 2010,The kind of film you have to know the end of but not the kind you'd want to see again,"What really annoyed me about this film was that it was so unrealistic. This probably sounds like a stupid accusation: it's an animated movie about a monster house, but still there were some things in it that spoilt the whole thing for me. Such as: a house exploded and nobody seemed to notice or care, the only police that were involved went missing and nobody came looking for them, a house got up and walked around and nobody seemed to notice it or the path of destruction it left behind, a man fell unconscious on top of a boy and the poor kid wasn't told anything by the people in the ambulance about whether he was okay or not (wouldn't he need to get a treatment for shock or something!? He was under the impression that he'd murdered someone! How come no police were informed?)and anyone who was supposedly eaten by the house wasn't looked for, you get the gist. I didn't expect this list to be quite so long, but when you look at the entire film logically I didn't even see any cars on the street just when the monster house is stomping across the road, how convenient. In fact there hardly seemed to be any cars on the road, but maybe i'm just getting paranoid that can't be too unusual. Oh and whilst I'm complaining why on earth did Nebbercracker have dynamite in his home!?On a more positive note the characters were interesting, especially Nebbercracker. I could tell that he clearly had some sort of motive, when you saw the look on his face you knew everything he was feeling. I certainly began to develop hunches. Yet he still managed to be truly creepy. As a friend once said to me: if a boy is spying on the old man across the street it's called paranoia, if the old man is spying on a boy across the street it's called something else. As for the 3 main characters I liked DJ the most. He seemed much smarter than his friend and had a fair amount of common sense which was good because I absolutely hated Chowder. He got on my nerves big time for not being a very good friend and for being incredibly stupid at times. He'd seen all the signs that the house was dangerous but as soon as the owner's gone he happily jumps all over it's lawn, if it's a monster house surely it doesn't matter who's there or not. As for Jenny I thought she was okay, she certainly brought a lot of sense and planning into their attack but didn't seem to have much else to her other than being pretty. I thought Constance was a very misunderstood character portrayed brilliantly by the animation and script, I felt sorry for her even when she was trying to get rid of the heroes. Probably due to my dislike of Chowder...but never mind."
11,Monster House,6,2 April 2007,There Goes The Neighborhood.,"Douglas J. Walters (""DJ"" ) is a preteen boy who is observing his neighbor, Nebbercracker, for a long time. Nebbercracker lives on the other side of their street, and is well known for his bad mood and terrible manners towards the children of the neighbor. D.J. is almost sure that Nebbercracker's house has some kind of monster inside of it, since weird things happens there, even when Nebbercracker is hospitalized and the house should be quiet.When D.J.'s parents travel , it's his chance along with his friends Jenny and Chowder, to know the truth about the house. What they don't know, is that a mysterious secret is hidden in it, that is also the reason for Nebbercracker's bad mood.''Monster House'' is a cute animation, but I found it too weak to be nominated to an Academy Award. The movie doesn't scare ( as the title of the movie would imply something frighting ), has flaws (like no one watching the house moving, except the children) and the story is very silly, even for kids in their 9's and 10 years old. I miss great animations like Ice Age,Finding Nemo, Monsters S.A. and Shrek (thanks God the third movie of the series will be released this year!); this movie cannot be compared to them, unfortunately, and I would only recommend it to younger kids."
12,Monster House,10,22 July 2006,Animation is qualitatively superior to what I've seen before,"This film was just fabulous. Digital animation of people is supposed to be really difficult; this film made it look effortless. Unlike most animated films, the camera angles weren't static; the illusion of reality was heightened by a sense that there was a camera on-set with carefully planned pans and tracking shots. Oddly enough, I thought the basketball game early in the film was one of the best pieces of animation throughout (though it had little to do with the plot). Take note of the unsteady camera effect. (This reminded me of the CGI in ""Firefly"" -- the shaking camera is a particularly cool effect when you know that the entire scene is artificially created).The story and characters were fabulous as well. I took my five-year-old to see it and he wasn't unpleasantly scared... he just thought it was cool. I can't wait for the DVD to come out -- hopefully at Halloween. What a great film!"
13,Monster House,7,23 July 2006,Not for little kids,"The animation was incredible - best rendering yet, and the character movements so mimic how real people move it's very easy to forget you're watching an animated movie. It's for kids, but not for the littlest ones. My six year old got too scared to continue about 1/4th of the way in and she had to take him home. It lightened up later, but the scary set up was too much for him to get through. Steve Bucemi's Nebbercracker was great. I'll go back and see it again when it comes out in digital 3D later. You can see that it was set up to be a good 3D flick from the beginning. All in all very well done film; but my kid will have to be seven or eight to handle the scary set-up."
14,Monster House,,4 August 2008,Lots of fun,"Pros: 1. Some genuinely scary moments. There are a couple really clever spooky scenes in this film, one involving a moving shadow and another involving a demented old man.2. Some nice nods to Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and ""Rear Window"", as the three children spy on a sinister house through a telescope.3. Some pretty clever camera work. Director Gil Kenan's orchestrates several neat flourishes worthy of Welles. Watching this film in 3D, I was also impressed with the use of shadows. It's a pretty creepy looking film.4. Captures the whole ""suburban fantasy"" feel of Zemeckis' and Spielberg's early work (ie ET, Poltergeist, Back to the Future etc).5. One of the first animated films to use motion capture technology. ""The Polar Express"" did this a year earlier, but married the captured performances to ""realistic"" looking characters. Here the technology is used to apply realistic motion to more overtly cartoonish models.7. Two or three funny nods to ""Forrest Gump"".Cons: 1. Forgettable characters. Our 3 heroes are pretty bland.2. Like most CGI flicks, the last half hour degenerates into loud and annoying action spectacle. I had this same problem with ""Surf's Up"". What starts off as an unconventional and charming flick, eventually ends up in mindless Hollywood territory.3. Inside the house is pretty unimaginative. All the horror and mystery is lost once the kids go indoors.7.5/10 - Outside of PIXAR, this is one of the most imaginative and entertaining animated films of recent years. Worth one viewing."
15,Monster House,1,18 November 2006,"bad, horrible, terrible, DON'T BOTHER!!!!!!!!","I honestly can't believe what passes for entertainment now. Death (and making fun of death), violence, sexual innuendo, adults threatening children, crudeness, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitter from hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, police and fat people, and kids sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night - yup, sure sounds like a kids movie to me - NOT!!! Add to that the dark and scary elements - a dead woman possessing and turning into a house and keeping her loving husband a prisoner inside for over 20 years, and also terrorizing an entire neighborhood - how sweet for kids. PARENTS - is this really what you want your kids to be watching - is this what you want to teach them about life?!This movie is too scary for young kids, and i'm afraid that teens today may be living some of this movie scenario - so why rub it in their faces? As for an adult audience - you won't find it scary or amusing - just boring, contrived and predictable. And the characters are just wrong - clueless parents, ignorant police, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters, and beer drinking/womanizing boyfriends. What great material for kids - does this really sound like a children's movie to anyone? Even the computer animation and good voice work aren't enough to redeem this terrible flick. Save your money, save your time, and save your children's minds - go rent Ice Age, Monsters Inc., the Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - ANY of them are way better than this horrid film. Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it as a children's/family movie!!"
16,Monster House,2,31 July 2006,badly executed sequence of tired clichés,"Typical of the level of this movie is the ""uvula"" gag (literally). The visuals make you think this is going to be something cool and important, but what develops is one dumb joke and the weak/gross basis for an escape. The whole plot feels strained an unbalanced. There's just not a lot of fun in watching it. To anyone posting a good rating...who's paying you? How many lines does it take to say that I didn't like the movie? Before seeing it, I'd read one review that claimed there was an interesting story behind the ""horror"". After seeing the movie, I have to disagree. The back story thin. The flashback animations are not up to the same standard as the rest of the movie, which makes you think they were slapped in after the fact. I'm giving it a two out of ten just to save the one rating for a movie that actually does damage when you see it."
17,Monster House,5,1 March 2007,Not convinced,"THE GOODThe cinematics (camera movements and virtual lenses), which are almost better than Pixar's, the virtual lightning (marvelous). Great cinematic experience.The ending song, ""Halloween"". Stunning to hear how this 30 years old song by Siouxsie and the Banshees still sounds fresh and edgy in 2007. What a great band, ahead of its time.THE BADShallow and formulaic character development, hollow one-dimensional characters, lack of face expression (they relied too much on the actors).Also looks kinda outdated. When you have such a ""realistic"" CGI environment for the characters to live in, having static hair and soft movements for human characters is a major letdown, it doesn't fit in.Extremely poor screenplay and lazy storytelling, mainly the flashback part about the circus woman, which could have been a terrific and very moving sub-story, but is sadly just sloppily executed.Unfunny gags. Far too clean. Lacks grit. Lacks spirit, lacks real juice. Questionable editing decisions.Overall, pretty tame, and slightly boring compared to the ""big"" projects in modern animation (Over the Hedge, Madagascar, Nemo...), with the exception of the cinematics, which are among the very best I've seen."
18,Monster House,6,6 February 2007,"Subpar, with a loss of focus too awkward to amend","Despite its obvious Halloween themed overtones, Monster House was released this past summer to modest box office receipts. Being a ""scary"" animated film in the middle of July, it did fairly well for itself. I had wanted to see it, but something felt off about the trailers and reviews I read about it. It was recently nominated for a Best Animated Film Academy Award, and just by chance, I finally had the opportunity to see it. And there indeed was something off.Something is not right at Mr. Nebbercracker's (Steve Buscemi) house. Anytime an object lands on his property or anywhere near the house, it automatically becomes his, and he is never nice to anyone in the neighbourhood. D.J. (Mitchel Musso) is intrigued by the whole thing, and continually spies and watches Nebbercracker's movements. Shortly after his parents leave for a two day trip, his friend Chowder (Sam Lerner) arrives with a new basketball. A missed shot lands the ball on Nebbercracker's lawn. D.J. attempts to retrieve it, and ends up in an argument with the old man, resulting in his apparent ""death"". After the ambulance takes him away though, strange things begin happening with his house, and begins to come alive.Yes, the plot is extremely silly, but in a nostalgic 1980's sort of way. It may be animated, but it feels much in the same realm as live action fare like The Goonies, Gremlins and all the other mildly scary and terrifically silly films of that time period. It just has that distinct feel and mold to it, that just seems out of place in 2006, but would be right at home in 1986. It is not that the film is not good, but it just feels a bit too over-the-top, even for a kid's film. When the house really starts getting to the point of being beyond haunted, it just loses its focus and becomes a bad monster movie. Giving the whole thing an emotional backgrounder that little to no kids would be able to understand really does not help the film all that much either. It just contributes to its ridiculousness.The story is imaginative and most definitely entertains, but only to a certain point. When things start getting explained, the film's narrative stops at a halt, and just barely picks up afterwards. It drags itself out to its eventual finale, and it just does not need all of this extra exposition. Why do we need gross pee jokes? Or a tokin' bumbling black rookie cop? Do the filmmakers honestly believe that little children are going to be taking these in as the funny moments they are meant to be? Or are they going to be too afraid to open their eyes with all of the horrific mayhem going on on-screen? It is not like the film holds back on the cheap child-like scares, it only keeps up. And especially being a kids movie, it just felt awkward to do so. The in-jokes were amusing however, but again, will go sailing past a young child more so than similar things in other animated films.Another thing that threw me off was the animation itself. Now I may be more accustomed to the work of Pixar and Dreamworks, but some of the work done here just feels very aged and withered. No character has any real distinguishing features between each other (beyond their obvious personality differences), and virtually none of them have any real detail in their looks. Now, this may be attributed to the motion-capture style animation being done to bring this film to life, but then why were Gollum and King Kong so frigging detailed? It screams of lazy film-making, and again, makes it feel more at home in 1986. Even after looking at the fascinatingly short making-of featurettes on the DVD, I still cannot fathom why so much work went into creating the animation to be just right, but not enough was put in to make it intricately detailed like other CGI-animated films.The voice talent all deliver their lines and actions very well. Buscemi is a hoot as the crazy old man Nebbercracker. He gives the right amount of intensity and emotion needed at all times, even when the focus of the film really begins to slip. Mercer, Lerner and Spencer Locke (the female of the group, Jenny) are not too bad at all as the kids trying to get to the bottom of the disturbances. Their naivety and adventuresome nature make for some greatly imaginative moments in the film (albeit, the film could have cut most of their wasteful scenes from their material). Supporting turns from Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Lee, Kevin James and Jon Heder are all amusing in their own right, and were definitely interesting choices for these actors.All around, Monster House is a disappointing film culled from a very interesting idea. Its sheer ridiculousness just cannot be offset by the fact that its a children's film. That never gave anyone else a free pass to make subpar work, and unfortunately that is exactly what this film is. It is watchable though, but I doubt I will ever see why the Academy gave this film the nomination and passed on the astonishing satire of the far superior Over the Hedge.6.5/10."
19,Monster House,3,6 September 2006,Frustrating and annoying,"Monster House looked cheaply made as far as CGI films are concerned, like they didn't want to spend the extra money creating characters in the background. Until the end, it seems as though DJ, Chowder and Jenny were the only people living in the neighborhood, which is especially odd considering the film takes place on Halloween and lacks a sense of excitement and anticipation.No cars drive by except the cop car, no one is seen walking outside their houses until after the film's climax, and this Suburbia has the most soundproof houses ever as no one seems to notice a roaring house a few feet away causing quite a raucous. The pizza shop is also completely empty. No crowds gather when the house chases the trio, not even a ""Look, Mommy! The house next door is walking!"" Was everyone off on holiday? Not to mention DJ's oblivious parents that don't believe Nebbercracker harassed a young girl and swiped her trike when they were right across the street.Even for a children's film the dialogue is just atrocious. There are so many cringe-inducing one liners. The writing all together was awful. The plot unfolds at a briskly uncomfortable pace. We don't know anything about the characters (or care) and one phone call from the apparently uninhabited haunted house points to one conclusion: it's a ghost and the kids are hellbent on solving the mystery.After hearing Jason Lee in The Incredibles and the guy who voiced the turtle in Over the Hedge, I'm beginning to believe that it is possible to give a horrible voice-over. Every actor here has an grating voice and play even more irritating characters (Jon Heder, in particular... if any actor was far overdue to portray a mute, he's it). Far too many lines are delivered aggressively, obnoxiously or in an unsuitable tone of voice.This should have been a modern-day, CGI Stand By Me, a coming of age tale woven into a more convoluted plot while still possessing relevance. There's no moral here, no lesson to be learned. There's a vague sense of the ""Don't grow up too fast"" tale but it's jettisoned too quickly to matter once the kids decide to go trick-or-treating in the end.Ultimately, a grating movie experience that had me checking my watch and rolling my eyes constantly."
20,Monster House,9,28 August 2006,i have meaner neighbours obsessed about their lawns,"there was something about Mr Nebbercracker that provoked suspicion about just how terrible a guy he really was. the fact that i wondered about this is, in my opinion, a testament to the superior animation and performances in this film. The characters were well fleshed out as well. How many of us have had best friends like Chowder? Or a baby-sitter like Zee? And Jenny, the very wise preppy with a great business mind, was vulnerable yet courageous, a theme applicable to almost every character. i am a fan of everyone in this film: Steve Buscemi, Maggie Gyllenhaal.Kevin James, Kathleen Turner, Jason Lee,Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard, and the kids portrayed by Michael Musso, Sam Lerner and Spencer Locke...everyone was convincing, empathetic, and engaging. This collaboration by Zemekis and Spielberg delivered an excellent piece which we've come to expect from these two masters. The direction by Gil Kenan had a great mix of scariness and compassion; and the screenplay is a star unto itself. What i enjoyed the most about this film, is the tenderness and devotion, courage and tenacity shown by the lead characters. And of course, Mr Nebbercracker. Ir's about love, after all. Ir's a great family film, perhaps for older children as well as adults, and it has a kind message disguised within an 'animated' horror. And the dual meaning applies. Ir had it's scary moments for sure. and an interesting, although guessable, story line.But this didn't take away anything from the film. I enjoyed it quite a lot, and wouldn't hesitate to take my niece or nephew or friends' child just to see it again. OK. so i'd watch it again by myself or with another adult too. Highly recommended!"
21,Monster House,9,27 July 2006,Respectively the best animated feature of this year,"Each year that one animated feature comes out that really sticks with me (Corpse Bride, Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Shrek). This year's been fairly boring, with mediocre to not-so-good movies coming out (Cars, Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, Doogle, Over the Hedge, Barnyard, The Ant Bully). It is simply a great movie for kids. Not for ones that are too young but definitely a nice gem for boys who like to get spooked. It's a thrilling ride that's as entertaining as it is stunningly visual. Gil Kenan's directorial debut comes in as somewhat of a shock, with his excellent attention to detail and incredible sense of direction with the spook-fest that is ""Monster House"".The movie centers around DJ and Chowder, two pre-teen friends who suspect the house across the street is evil. After losing their ball on the yard, Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi), the owner of the house, gets a heart attack while trying to scare the kids off. His sudden 'death' angers the house, making it turn into a creature with the windows as the eyes, and the door as the mouth.The idea that a house has a face and walks around may sound stupid, but with the stellar animation it completely works. Kenan not only offers much laughter, but focuses on scaring us with what we all feared as kids (at least the ones who lived in Suburban homes), that one spooky house we were always afraid to go near. The house swallows people, blows steam from the chimney and plays dead when authority comes to check it out.There's always some aspect of the film, at least in an animated feature that doesn't work. Take for example ""Shrek"" or ""Shrek II"". What bothered me is that they focused on making little children laugh (the donkey is NOT funny for someone who doesn't laugh at fart jokes). Or ""The Incredibles"", where the aspect of children having superpowers has been done to death. Aside from ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monster House"" is the one movie that has everything going for it. Though at times the humor is targeted at a much younger audience, there are instances where you know this is not a G-rated movie ('OK, let's cut the crap, I know that the owners left you some money... Now buy some Halloween candy').DJ and Chowder are almost too realistic. Their mannerisms, their facial expressions, their behavior far reaches beyond any child star. The character of Zee (voiced by Maggie Gyllenhaal) is awe-inspiring, with her exaggerated body language that probably made Maggie herself blush. Nebbercracker is probably my favorite character. Voiced by the hilarious Buscemi, the seemingly rotten old man is both hilarious and scary. He's the heart of the story (pun intended) and the drive for the 'horror' aspect of the film.We've all been there. We all loved to watch scary movies as kid. But not too scary, I'm talking about movies like ""Goonies"" and ""Gremlins"" and ""The Addams Family"". We all loved to watch scared kids taking on adults or monsters, with classics such as ""Home Alone"", and ""Die Unendliche Geschichte (The Neverending Story)"". This movie combines both of those in order to satisfy a younger audience and create a sense of nostalgia in the older demographic.With one of the best animated scenes I've ever seen on the screen (at the end, with the dynamite being thrown), ""Monster House"" goes up there with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", and ""Beetle Juice"" as a Burtonesque type of film that defines childhood desire for fear. Definitely a movie that can be seen more than just once, and the best 3D Animated Feature since ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monster House"" is a sure contender at the Academy Awards in 2007, and perhaps the most fun movie of the summer so far."
22,Monster House,7,21 July 2006,A solid fun horror ride,"I saw the 3D version of Monster House, which I recommend as THE format to see the film in.The story is pretty simple and not entirely original. But the zest for which the characters jump into your lap (figuratively and literally) makes this a fun ride through a house of horrors.The overall animation is pretty decent, but the facial expressions are absolutely fantastic. They are so lifelike. The lack of photo realism in other features is quickly ignored as you feel at times like you are watching a real life childhood drama unfold right in front of you.Who hasn't had a spooky house in their neighborhood that was legend? This film taps into that legend and brings to life through gleeful fun the horror that unfolds.This continues a great bunch of surprises I have experienced this summer at the local multiplex."
23,Monster House,7,3 March 2007,Stay Away From Nebbercracker's Lawn,"The teenage DJ is observing his neighbor Nebbercracker on the other side of their street in the suburb that destroys tricycles of children that trespass his lawn. When DJ's parents travel on the eve of Halloween and the abusive nanny Zee stays with him, he calls his clumsy best friend Chowder to play basketball. But when the ball falls in Nebbercracker's lawn, the old man has a siege, and sooner they find that the house is a monster. Later the boys rescue the smart Jenny from the house and the trio unsuccessfully tries to convince the babysitter, her boyfriend Bones and two police officers that the haunted house is a monster, but nobody believes on them. The teenagers ask their video-game addicted acquaintance Skull how to destroy the house, and they disclose its secret on the Halloween night.""House Monster"" begins like ""Fright Night"", i.e., a teenager sees a weird situation with his neighbor and nobody gives credit to his words. The story is flawed, since nobody sees the attacks and movements of the house in the whole neighborhood, only the three teens. But the movie is very funny, with great animation and hilarious voices, and an excellent and worthwhile family entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Casa Monstro"" (""The Monster House"")"
24,Monster House,1,17 October 2006,Don't bother watching,"Seeing the 6.9 overall rating, I figured it must be pretty good, so I went to see it. It was a complete waste of my time. There were parts that were amusing, but didn't last longer than 5 minutes combined. The rest of the movie was not inspiring, predictable, and simply unreal (especially towards the end). The characters are annoying, especially the main characters best friend. The babysitter's friend does not deserve to live. Reminded me of people I knew back in high school. They are probably jobless, walking around the streets somewhere. The only success they'll find is probably illegal. drugs or something similar. You'll get nothing out of this movie, be amused for a few minutes at most here and there, and you'll come out wishing you spent your time better."
25,Monster House,2,2 August 2006,I don't really see the appeal...,"I don't really see the appeal of this movie. I enjoy a lot of cartoon movies, both geared towards kids and a wider audience, but this one just didn't seem to come together for me.It wasn't really captivating enough for the adults in the group I saw it with. Parts of it seemed a bit too intense for small kids, and I think older kids just wouldn't care. The morality lesson of not making fun of people with unfortunate physical characteristics was tired (not that it's not a good lesson, just doesn't always make for a good movie).Oh, and isn't this a Halloween movie? Maybe they released it now so the video would get a sales boost by having an October release.All of this just makes this one a bit of a waste of time."
26,Monster House,4,26 July 2006,Bad for kids,"I'm an 8 year old boy who saw the commercials on TV. I saw the movie and I think it is wrong. The old man dying when he attacked that kid was wrong, just died out of the blue. The boyfriend and stuffed animal thing where he licked it and ripped it up should have been rated pg-13. It is not a movie for kids.--------------As the parent of my son - he is correct. This is not a movie for ""children"", despite being advertised to children on TV, in movie previews and magazines. Many of the scenes are disturbing, and while OK for some families, it does not reflect the values I wish to teach my child. A list of some the more appalling images shown to small children are: An adult attacking a child. The child believing he caused the man's death. A teenager attacking a child in his sleep. The teenager ""making out"" with the child's stuffed animal. The teenager tearing the animal apart in front of the child. The teenager drinking alcohol.If this had not been billed as a movie for kids, I wouldn't have had a problem. But once again, Steven Spielberg has shown that he must be a failure as a father if this is what he considers children's entertainment. I should have known better since this is the man who brought the foul mouthed Goonies to children."
27,Monster House,1,23 July 2006,this movie sucked,The animation wasn't that great and the story (such as it was) dragged (I dozed off at least three times). The dismal attempts at humor fell flat - there wasn't a single funny scene in the entire movie (unless you find bad manners and rudeness funny). This movie was COMPLETELY inappropriate for children and contained several sexual innuendos and references to puberty so obvious a 6 year old would pick up on them. It also contained some psychological themes that are not only not funny but were also inappropriate for children. I don't personally think it is funny to make fun of obese people and make them out to seem as if they belong in a circus and that they are all psychologically damaged. This just wasn't right.
28,Monster House,2,16 August 2006,Empty House,"Monster House eh? I felt more like home alone in an empty house. But first let me say it is way too scary for little kids. They'll be so scared it will stunt their growth from being forced to watch such a vacant flick. And kids should not be raised on bad flicks. Take the suburban neighborhood where this takes place. Either its a really paranoid locale or folks are too afraid to venture out because of the Bird Flu flap. This is a place where only the essential characters exist. And if you ain't an essential character, stay in your homes. What a strange place. The best part about this movie, besides the credits, was the ""old man"". He's great, but copying the ""Scrooge"" effect, he turns around. Geez didn't see that coming or the predictable ending. Okay, so this house is a ""fixer upper"" you say?. I say its a house that should be condemed, now that I've torn it down. In the past I really loved Spielberg and Zemicis works. But as others have stated, they lost it. This movie made me think not only did they lose it, but now it rolled under the couch and they can't get it back. But at least together they've made a truly forgettable film."
29,Monster House,10,31 July 2006,In the wonderful footsteps of The Goonies,"Three things make up a good action/comedy: A dangerous task, hilarious yet loving characters, and action scenes that scar in your mind. Monster House took these rules and surpassed them for miles! The main characters (the heroic, puberty-cursed DJ, the clumsy sidekick Chowder, and the cute-for-a-girl Jenny) are simply brilliant. They are all very realistic (in attitude, anyway) and their small childish comments in the face of danger (""I kissed a girlon the lips!"") make them believable and memorable. Their humor and actions resemble those of the characters in The Goonies, which this movie greatly resembles itself. Fans of Goonies will feel somewhat at home when watching this film.The side characters are your typical from-the-kid's-point-of-view grown-ups who don't quite understand, or believe, what the children are saying (babysitter, police officers, angry neighbor). They are all amazing performances, even the video game-obsessed Skull, voiced by Napoleon Dynamite's Jon Heder, who simply comes back to play yet another nerd.The storyline was somewhat ridiculous, but still made for an extremely interesting movie. The scary, Gollum-looking, kleptomaniac Nebbercracker iserno longer living in the scary ""house across the street."" However, DJ notices that the house itself is still alive, taking its vengeance out on anything that steps on its lawn. With Halloween in just two days, he and Chowder think of ways to prove to adults that the house is, in fact, evil. When Chowder catches eye of the adorable, red-headed Jenny, selling candy door-to-door, approaching the Monster House, the two boys save her, thus forming a sort a friendship that continues throughout the entire movie. The best moments between the three are up in DJ's room while DJ and Chowder are trying to impress the girl. Oh, how I laughed. Another priceless scene is between the babysitter, Z, and Jenny as the young girl tries to sell the wicked teenager Halloween candy. It was very sarcastic, smart, and hilarious.The voice acting was superb and the effects were top-notch. In my personal opinion, this topped Disney/Pixar's Cars by a mere hair. It was very close, but Monster House has the wit, the sarcasm, the excitement, and the characters that keep you interested and sometimes breathless throughout the entire film.I've seen three movies this year that have instantly because new favorites of mine overnight: Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Click, and Monster House. This movie is destined to become a cult classic. But, then again, would you expect any less from Robert Zemekis and Steven Spielberg? Great, trippy, bizarre, and hilarious film!"
30,Monster House,4,26 July 2006,"Wrong season, should have been released around Halloween","Boring...1. Why would you release a Halloween movie in the middle of the summer blockbuster season, instead of around, say, Halloween? I really believe that contributed to it's lack of enjoyability. Wrong season.2. The skinny kid who saves the day gets the girl, the fat kid continues being clueless. There is one black character in the entire movie, everyone else is white. The fat woman is mean. Thanks, Misters Spielberg and Zemeckis (sp?), for continuing on our stereotyped traditions.3. How is it that an old man who has what seems to be a stroke or a heart attack shows back up wearing a sling on his arm? Can't see a pacemaker and had to use a visual? Truly a boring movie, and I am a huge proponent of children movies for adults (see Hoodwinked, The Incredibles, Monsters, Inc.). If you're interested in seeing Monster House, I recommend waiting to rent it around Halloween."
31,Monster House,3,21 July 2006,not for kids,"I just took my 7 year old to see the movie. We didn't think of the movie as ""scary"". We do however feel it is very unsuitable for younger children. There were to many references to beer drinking and what I would consider adult content. In one instance, a character actually insinuated that beer drinking would make him appear attractive to the opposite sex. I would not recommend this movie to anyone under 12(maybe older) and I would cautiously let an older child watch. There were actually a couple of families that left during the beginning of the movie. I can only speculate as to why as the movie had not yet started to be ""scary"". The beer drinking started right from the get go though."
32,Monster House,5,15 July 2006,"Rental for you kids if they are over 10, but nothing more.","The movie uses motion capture, which I just could not get into. Does it want to look like Claymation? Does it want to be but CGI? The look of the film isn't bad, but I didn't appreciate it. The dark edge of the storyline wants to be like a Tim Burton movie but failed to capture my imagination. The music wants to be Danny Elfman but comes off as imitation. No Pixar magic. No Spielberg or Zemeckis spark (although they are the Executive Producers). Not suitable for my seven year old son. I give the writers credit for keeping out the Shrek/pop culture type references (which have become all to common), but I just had too many problems with the story that I found its other faults distracting. People don't talk about how Nightmare Before Christmas doesn't make sense, which of course it doesn't. But all I keep thinking during this film was 'this storyline too doesn't make sense'. Because the storyline is not very engaging, I didn't suspend disbelief and found the whole plot just odd. Do I care about the ""monster in this movie"" like I cared about the say monsters in Monsters, Inc? No. We find out about the history/story of this monster in a 2 minute flash back, otherwise this monster has no personality, nothing to care about. The monster here is not an engaging character--it just the scary bogeyman (bogeywoman?) screaming, yelling and shaking its arms. Not a terrible movie, just not very good. And who is this movie for exactly? I think that it will have a problem finding an audience and I think the producers are aware of this. Why else would you release a movie that takes place on Halloween in the middle of summer? So, it can be out on DVD by the time Halloween rolls around and hopefully make up the low box office take I predict will occur in its release this summer. Rental for you kids if they are over 10, but nothing more."
33,Monster House,5,20 July 2006,Not as kid friendly as trailer looks!!!!!!!,"The movie is very entertaining. BUT!!! Don't let the previews fool you. It's not just a funny scary house throwing newspapers at passing kids. It is very much a PG movie. The Trailer leads you to believe that the kids will laugh and giggle throughout the movie. There were a lot of scared children for the screening. There are a lot of scary images, suggestions, and implications. Mom's and Dad's might have to do a lot of damage control for some things that happen. Be ready to do a lot of hugging and explaining. The kid's in the movie are engaging. Monster House is a Oct. 30 must. A sleep over would do it justice. Stay through the end credits to cut out some explaining time. HA! HA! HA!, the house was just playing. : )See!!!"
34,Monster House,5,14 August 2013,"Some Laughs, Few Scares Here","Scare comedies are never easy. You have to do two very different things, get the audience scared and make them laugh. Each is hard enough on its own; finding the right balance is the real trick.""Monster House"" falls, but falls on the right side of the fence, for a kid's movie anyway. Director Gil Kenan and his writing team overwork the laughs, leaving you with a shaggy-dog ""Goosebumps"" story about a carnivorous old house and a trio of unlikely pre-teen friends who team up to take it down.DJ is a boy on the cusp of puberty, beginning to feel too old for trick- or-treating when Halloween comes along. But trick-or-treating is very much on his mind, as he discovers a dark secret about an old house across the street: It's alive, and it's hungry!Since it's designed for a younger demographic, it's hard to complain about a mildly funny comedy that leaves me flat in the story-and-thrills department. It amuses, in part because of some sharp moments in the script and in part because it captures a sense of suburban preteen life, when one begins to think like an adult without being required to act like one. I think the film is set in the early 1980s, with old coin-operated video games and Olivia Newton-John on the car radio, so I felt more at home watching this than expected.I liked the banter between DJ and his pal, Chowder, likable dorks who find their friendship tested both by the house and by the appearance of the pretty-but-snobby Jenny. ""Normally I don't spend time with guys like you, but a house just tried to eat me so you've got one hour,"" she tells them.Despite funny lines like this, I found it hard sitting still during the big finale, when we learn the secret of the house's ornery owner, Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi). Though it's an animated film, Buscemi and the other actors doesn't just voice their roles but act them out using the same ""motion-capture"" process pioneered on ""The Polar Express."" It's an interesting technology, though the animation isn't quite there yet here. All the characters seem to have influenza and severe dental issues, and move stiffly and unnaturally at times.The big problem is the story; it's basically the title premise and some build-up with patchy logic. Adults don't believe anything is wrong until they find themselves on the wrong side of the welcome mat, yet their disappearances seem to pass without notice. Much of the action occurs either on a quiet street and in a vacant lot, where no one seems to notice the screaming, explosions and other activity. Normally I'd be concerned about a homicidal house on the rampage, but it seems this Mayville place may have bigger problems not discussed in the script.I don't think pre-teens will enjoy ""Monster House"" that much; I don't expect they'll identify with the characters. Smaller children will probably enjoy the wild visuals, and adults will find some humor in lines that fly over the heads of the small fry."
35,Monster House,7,7 September 2011,If this film had come out when I was a kid...,"There is something really spooky about this animated film for children. I think that if this film had come out during my own childhood, it would have scared me away from even going outside. The entire film is centered around a humiliated and abused old man who is haunted my his beloved wife, who was actually his abuser. Her evil spirit then takes control of the house, which harms children because of her own hatred for children, which comes from years of children harassing and demeaning her because of weight issues. All of this seems pretty heavy for it's target audience. With the whole storyline aside, I can still imagine it from a child's perspective, it's a creepy house that comes to life and eats children. That, all on it's own, is enough to scare any child. It was well put together, the score was great, and I would consider it a good film. It seems like perhaps an older child's stepping stone from kiddie movies to horror films, and I love that concept."
36,Monster House,10,23 November 2010,Brilliant,"I firmly believe Monster House is the best animated film of 2006. I did like Happy Feet and Cars, but Monster House beats them both in my opinion. It is superbly animated, with the colours really bold and the character designs and backgrounds really interesting. I also liked the music, which further added to the atmosphere, while the story is briskly paced and smartly written. My favourite assets though are the script and characters. The characters are brilliantly written and wonderfully voiced, while the script is witty and inquisitive. Overall, I love Monster House and strongly recommend it for pretty much anybody really. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
37,Monster House,9,14 August 2006,I Wish More People Would See This Movie,"I wouldn't say this movie was brilliant. But I would certainly say it was really, really good. Especially for a ""kids movie."" It's probably a little much for small children. I would describe it as a Horror Movie for kids, so if you're a parent and you feel your children are easily freaked out or you are evil and refuse to let them watch anything fun, you may want to view it yourself first. All I could think about while watching it was, ""Man, I wish this had come out when I was 12."" I think it hearkens back to the kinds of kids movies I grew up on, kids movies that had some edge to them (Goonies, Gremlins, Dark Crystal, Ghostbusters, etc.)I highly recommend seeing the movie in 3-D, if you can still find a theater showing it. I normally hate 3-D because it looks like crap (Superman Returns's 3-D sucked, for example.) But I'm assuming since this was computer animated it simplified the process. Frankly, seeing it in 3-D probably elevated my opinion of the story. Everything just seemed more interesting."
38,Monster House,8,28 July 2006,Don't let the summer pass without visiting this house...,"You can grab your popcorn with pride again, because someone has remembered that the movies are supposed to be fun sometimes! Halloween is only two days away, but DJ (Mitchel Musso) can't enjoy it. Much to his pal Chowder's (Sam Lerner) chagrin, he's thinking of giving up trick-or-treating. There's just too much on his mind--his parents off on a convention, his punk-rock babysitter Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) giving him grief, not to mention weird old Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi), whose full-time occupation appears to be terrorizing the neighborhood kids.The atmosphere of weirdness takes on new dimension, however, when, after one negative encounter too many, Nebbercracker drops out of the scene. Afterward, not only things, but PEOPLE begin to disappear, and only the kids, DJ, Chowder, and straight-arrow girl scout Jenny (Spencer Locke) realize the truth. They have stumbled on to the bad side of Nebbercracker's domicile, and their only chance is to find out the whole truth--before Halloween arrives and all the neighborhood kids become a smörgåsbord.Per a rule of thumb I made, I went in with no expectations, and came out loving this. I personally believe that the true horror film is a lost art, buried in suspense thrillers, shock value, and cheap slashers or slasher sequels. VERY few movies are actually scary anymore. I read another critic's review of this movie, and he said something I thought was profound--had this film been done in live action, it would be far TOO scary (possibly for no one more than the poor producers who would have to pay for it). In the able hands of first-time director Gil Kenan, this second experiment by Zemeckis & Spielberg into the world of motion capture pays off. We get more of a scope of the actors' performances--of course, it's more fun if you don't know who's playing whom, so you've gotten all about the cast you're going to get from me! Special touches help bring us into the kids' plight. Some great airborne camera angles and fine visual effects draw you in. It also has a long-overdue story with heart; about loneliness, loss, and moving on. Very small children might come away with a share of nightmares--just a warning of what is possible; to its credit, the House is truly terrifying, particularly in the last 15 minutes. The good humor in this picture should overshadow any ill will, however.The youngsters in my showing gave it a nice ovation, well deserved. Don't let summer go by without visiting this house, just don't go alone."
39,Monster House,6,23 July 2006,"Silly Fun, But...","While watching ""Monster House"" I found myself trying to ignore inconsistencies in the story, but they kept cropping up. For example, I kept wondering why only children ever noticed anything wrong with the house. Even if no one else saw anything, the house was terrifically noisy throughout. Especially when the house began dragging itself through the neighborhood in pursuit of the children, it seemed impossible for others not to notice.Also, though I was willing to suspend disbelief, there seemed to be no reason for any attraction between the old man and his wife, unless he simply had a fetish. Nothing about the wife's circumstances made sense, anyway. At least her history only came out near the end.The best thing about the movie was the main characters' well-developed personalities. Though the animation was somewhat strange, the children were especially fully and realistically developed and their facial expressions were marvelous. At times, I felt like I was watching real people.The one thing that spoiled the movie for me was this: Though both the policemen were stereotypical cop buffoons, the rookie cop--the only black character in the film-- was offensive. His round rolling eyes, ""humorous"" mental slowness and mannerisms were too much like the racially stereotypical comedy popular in 1920's-1930's. I am a white person, and this sort of characterization was out of place. It left me wondering how it would be received by my African-American friends and their children. As I exited the theater, I felt bemused that this type of ""humor"" had been done, especially since I thought Spielberg or someone ought to have been more aware. All I can hope is that those negative racial stereotypes are far enough in the past that most of today's audiences do not associate them with ""Amos and Andy"", et. al., though they're still around in old movies.Over all, I think I would have preferred to have rented the movie, instead of paying theater prices to see it."
40,Monster House,1,4 August 2006,The first five minutes convinced me to leave - should be PG-13,"This movie is being billed as a fun, funny, and family movie. I took my 5, 6, and 7-year olds to see it (two boys, one girl). In the first five minutes we saw a curmudgeon yell and scare a little girl and tear her tricycle apart. Then we see the neighbor boy lifted by his lapels into the air and screamed at, just before said curmudgeon has a heart attack and dies. Then we see the boy's baby sitter show up, who is a crude, rude, drinking, and acid-rock goth-type babe. Then we see the shadow of the monster house 'flowing' through the boys window, emit a large clawed hand that then grab him. My little girl was jumping and crying. Although the boys protested, we all left. Fortunately, the theater manager said he had received a lot of complaints, and allowed us to see 'Garfield:Tale of Two Kitties' instead.Make no mistake, the movie is very good for teenagers. It uses all the standard scare techniques of a slasher movie, so its much too intense for younger viewers. That is, the music, sound, and color are all well done to set the mood of fear and surprise, but younger children just can't handle such psychological manipulation. After 90-mintes of Garfield my little girl was much happier, but I'm still sorry for having to put here through all that. This movie should be rated PG-13 to warn parents that little kids should stay away.I'm rating this as awful for hopes a parent will see the review and be forewarned. For older kids, this is probably a very good movie for its type."
41,Monster House,9,14 September 2014,"A really good animated movie for Halloween, next to Coraline and Paranorman.","When I first heard about this movie, at first, I was hooked. I was taken in by the animation, characters and the plot of the movie. Now when I saw the whole thing, I was seriously satisfied at what I've seen. The movie flowed very well; The characters were really good that I felt something from each and every one of them and the story of the movie was riveting and compelling. It made me want to know what will happen next and when the house gets what's coming to it. I'll give a brief summary without saying too much. A teenage boy named DJ is with a pretty terrible older teenage babysitter while his parents are away. Things aren't going so well for him so he asks his friend Chowder to play basketball with him. Then the ball lands on the territory of Mr. Nebbercracker's lawn who's really serious of people not on his land. When DJ and Chowder try and get it back, things go from bad to worse when Nebbercracker has a heart attack and goes to the hospital. That's when DJ has these strange dreams of his house coming alive as a monster. Little does he and his friend Chowder know and will soon find out that it's true and will uncover the secrets of the house and try to defeat it before it hits Halloween. My advice; If you want a movie that's scary fun for the family or a good Halloween flick for kids ages 9-12 or 13, make it ""Monster House."""
42,Monster House,6,15 September 2010,Monster House,"It was rated four stars by the critics, and then I found out that Steven Spielberg was involved, so I had to see what the big deal was. Basically little DJ (Mitchel Musso) is observing the spooky looking house right across the street belonging to neighbour Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) in the peaceful suburbs, it seems to be taking away anything and anybody that trespasses on the lawn. When DJ's Mom (Catherine O'Hara) and Dad (Fred Willard) go away on the eve of Halloween that things really get scary, but he can't get babysitter Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and her boyfriend Bones (Jason Lee) to believe him. It is when a ball goes on the neighbour's lawn that Nebbercracker comes out to get DJ and best friend Chowder (Sam Lerner) and gets so angry that he collapses and is taken away by an ambulance. Soon comes along Jenny (Spencer Locke), and when the house comes alive and tries to take her away, the boys save her, and now all three friends are determined to stop the chaos. They get some advice from video game nut Reginald 'Skull' Skulinski (Napoleon Dynamite's Jon Heder), and are watched a bit by Officer Lister (Nick Cannon) and Officer Landers (Kevin James), but the kids come up with a plan. When they manage to get themselves into the house, DJ discovers a bit about its history, and when Mr. Nebbercracker returns alive and well, he confirm the house is possessed by the spirit of his wife Constance (Kathleen Turner). After she died he buried her under the pit where the house was meant to be built, and when it was it became a monster with her spirit living, and after ""she"" chases after them all, Nebbercracker decides it is best to blow the house up with dynamite, and it is. This film was apparently made with the help of motion capture technology, like The Polar Express, it would certainly explain most of the lifelike body movements from characters. The film is filled with both family friendly funny moments, but also some moments the kids will probably turn their heads away from, I think personally it is a little overrated, but not a bad animated comedy horror. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Good!"
43,Monster House,9,27 December 2008,Great Animation Movie.....for teens or older!,"I enjoyed watching Monster House but do not believe the previews of this film. They portray this film as a PG movie that kids will enjoy. Actually this movie will probably encourage kids to never watch animated movies again. This should be PG-13. That point aside, it's time to talk about the positive side. The storyline is great and intense. It's about a house that has a spirit of the owner's wife within. It terrorizes kids and adults alike. It's up to three unlikely kids to try stop the house from eating everyone. The animation is decent. I have seen better, but this will pass. The music basically describes this movie. It is eerie and haunting. The voices are full of stars such as Steve Buscemi and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Parents, beware that you should never hire a babysitter such as the one in this movie. I rate this movie 9/10."
44,Monster House,10,11 November 2008,"Finally,something for the older crowd.","At first,I was thinking it was gonna be another stupid CGI-animated kids film,but when I went to see it,it was so great! The characters weren't cutesy-pie or dumb,just normal and quite hilarious teenage characters. Have you noticed how some computer animated movies have always been boring and nothing to it for the adults to enjoy but the kids only like it?Yeah,it's a pity how every animated movie nowadays have sucked,but Monster House is a different story. The idea about a scary house that comes to life is exciting for kids and mind-blowing for the adults because of its suspense and fright,and I was glad to see that. Monster House is not an average brainless kiddie movie,it was edgy,jokes that little kids wouldn't get,intelligent and hilarious characters make this animated movie nearly perfect. The only disadvantage was the computer animation that looked like it was still incomplete(a reviewer here said that it takes time to get use to the look of the animation because of how stiff it was),but that's just ONE problem,the rest of the movie was brilliant.Monster House is great to watch on Halloween or if you feel like getting away from irritating kids movies that today's kids are into nowadays instead of watching movies that are decent and humorous like this movie."
45,Monster House,8,3 November 2006,Quite a surprise!,"Although it was not as good as I thought it would be, Monster House is still quite an enjoyable movie.This animated comedy/family/action/mystery/thriller stars a lot of people from Nickelodeon's TV shows, like Ned's Declassified School's Survival Guide. Another one is from a show called Hannah Montana from Disney Channel. Monster House stars: Mitchel Musso (Disney Channel's Hannah Montana, Nickelodeon's Avatar: The Last Airbender), Sam Lerner (Envy), Spencer Locke (Nickelodeon's Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, Disney Channel's Phil of the Future), Steve Buscemi (Spy Kids trilogy, The Island), and Maggie Gyllenhaal (Stranger than Fiction, World Trade Center).Monster House is about a man who owns a, 'haunted house' across the street from an obsessed kid named D.J. (Musso). He's obsessed with the house. And so is his sloppy, porky best friend, Chowder (Lerner). While Elizabeth, a.k.a. Zee, is babysitting D.J., Chowder comes over, and they start becoming more and more obsessed after Mr. Nebbercracker, the owner of the house, supposedly has a heart attack. But when Nebbercracker comes back from the, 'dead', D.J. and Chowder become even more obsessed. And when they meet the sexy girl named Jenny, they become obsessed about her. And when the three go inside the house, they discover the truth about the house.An excellent movie for the whole family.Oh, and by the way, the music is awesome! It's so different from other movies.My MPAA rating: PG: Scary Images and Sequences, Thematic Elements, Some Crude Humor, Mild Drug References, and Brief Mild Language.My Canadian rating: PG: Frightening Scenes, Crude Humor, Mature Theme"
46,Monster House,7,2 November 2006,Well-Done Children's Adventure Movie,"Mild Spoilers Ahead.Leave it to the great team of Spielberg and Zemeckis to create a fun and exciting computer-animated movie. This movie should prove that Dreamworks CGI is just as capable as their Disney/Pixar rivals of making good and competent entertainment. This movie recreates the kid's adventure genre we've all seen in ""The Goonies."" The kids behave realistically, and their antics are not sugarcoated. Adults and children will both find something to enjoy in this flick. The story behind the ""monster house"" is rather tragic, and you do end up feeling sorry for the eponymous creature's fate. Overall, this is a very fun movie to watch."
47,Monster House,9,1 November 2006,One of the best Halloween movie for kids!,"I watched ""Monster House"" with my brother at Halloween night and it was perfect movie for that day. It has that temper. The image of house was very good. It acts like humans psychological world. My brother was very scared, because it was his first Halloween (he is 4 years old). But he liked it. It has a light scary moments.The creators has chosen a perfect voices for characters. They acted like voices. Every thing with characters was nice. I don't knew, that will be a Nebbercracker (an angry neighbor). But when he's gone, then begins that I was thought - the Monster House will be alive and hunt kids. Script and idea is very nice and everyone has to watch it at Halloween...I give a 9 for this scary day in the year..."
48,Monster House,7,28 October 2006,"Would have been nice if they kept it a ""Monster House""","Artistically, graphically, CGI wise - this is a nice film to view. And I scored it high based solely on that. You can tell much work went into the technology of this film.The question is: Who is it aimed at? Definitely not small children. The forgotten tweens? Possibly. Teens? Maybe. Adults - well, they should watch this first and decide whether or not to show it to their tweens. Not because it's scary per ce, but because it projects a lot of stereotypes that children of that age can easily detect.I would have enjoyed this film more if they kept it a 'Monster House'. The idea of an entire house being ""alive"" is a neat one, and done in this kind of animation is also interesting to watch. As children, I am sure we've all imagined houses with strange mean people who lived inside of them, alive. But what bothered me overall about this film was: the reason why the house was a monster.I got the feeling that those involved with this film didn't know how to characterize women well. There are four - The mother, who has a very limited role - you see her coming and going and that's about it; the babysitter - who you actually could have done without for in the scheme of things, she did nothing but complain about her missing boyfriend; the smart-alec-candy selling girl who was about as warm and friendly as a snowstorm in hades...and of course, the reason of this film - the Monster House.Monster House would have been fine with just the two boys trying to discover why the house was ""alive"". I felt these women characters were put in after the fact so not to show it's an ""old boys club film"". That should not have happened. There isn't any reason why it should not have just been the two boys adventure. Why be politically correct? Two boys trying to discover the problem is just fine, especially when you explain away the women as it is in this piece of animation.With Spielberg and Zemekis as Executive Producers, they could have shown the director the original movie of ""Poltergeist"" to gain some ideas. Disney's installments of ""Halloweentown"" would have helped too. I was totally dismayed with the explanation how the house got to be a Monster House. There is enough hate against women for not being a perfect ideal in the world. Making them into a 'monster house' for children to get that idea doesn't help promote compassion or understanding either."
49,Monster House,7,22 October 2006,Funny and frightful family animation,"Enjoyable CGI Halloween tale is most likely not for young children as it's marketing may have suggested, but would sit well with boys over twelve as one of the more entertaining animated films of the year. Coming to DVD one week before pumpkin night, Monster House is the ideal family Halloween movie at the moment. Taking place on that very night, the spectacular physical animation, creepy underlying themes, and haunted atmosphere make for that rare family cgi film that will sit nicely with young teens as well as many parents that join in. While the film might even go a little too far into it's serious tone late in the third act, the mostly light-hearted affair will carry plenty of laughs provided by the perceptive and witty interactions between characters."
50,Monster House,7,22 October 2006,"Monster House , Monster Good Time","Before sitting down to watch this animated film, I was expecting a children's tale filled with toddler-like jokes and juvenile references. I was pleasantly surprised and at the same time shocked at the darkness of the story and the adult humor. After seeing that this film was produced by Robert Zemeckis, it all started to make allot more sense. Starting out with an obvious reference to the filmmaker/producer a floating leaf is what introduces us to Steve Buscemi's character, Nebbercracker. Following this introduction to a very scary old man, we are introduced to the main character DJ, who has been spying on Nebbercracker from his house across the street for weeks now, watching the old man amp up his confiscation of children's toys.Filled with voices of well-known actors, including Jason Lee as the stoner boyfriend, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as his punk rock girlfriend, ""Z"", Monster House turns out to be a beautifully stylized animated story. Going for the ""Toy Story"" doll-like animation in this instance, Monster House pulls off its stray from realistic looking characters with its engaging animation and aesthetics. A little too morbid and scary for younger children, Monster House is perfect for any teenager, or adult alike. Beside the over-the-top ending bringing the ""Monster House"" to its feet, literally, the rest of the animated flick is very entertaining and is surely not a picture to miss."
51,Monster House,9,14 October 2006,"A landmark in animated film achievements, Monster House delivers!","I saw this movie TWICE at the cinema - and enjoyed it both times. The animation is superb, the characters memorable, the humour surprisingly strong, and the plot much better than I thought it was going to be. Though it is a bit predictable, this film completely steers clear of stereotypical animated film territory - the usual kiddy-drivel with talking animals and a fairytale plot, and is a film that will go down well at Halloween. Especially when we get inside the house, the story gets gripping - the kids find things that make them very suspicious. This is a film that is worthy of Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg, two great Hollywood directors, and is something much different. I am saddened that this film has gone from a low 7 to a high 6 - it is a superbly animated film, and I look forward to seeing it again when it hits DVD.Monster House never weakens throughout its running time, and unlike I said earlier, it is not predictable. This is something truly special - a strong script and good animation should always combine to make something like this. I damn well hope this gets the Best Animated Feature Oscar this year - or at least a nomination. A stunning job! 9/10"
52,Monster House,9,16 August 2006,A Kid Movie Not Just For Kids,"I went to this movie in order to cheer Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon on, expecting the way simple comedy often ends up on the big screen: stretched and mangled and not-so-funny. But, instead, I ended up being pleasantly surprised. Because this film is hilarious. I'm a bit too old for it to be scary (perhaps the seven and under group would find it so), but Monster House made me laugh out loud. The plot was basic with its own layer of complexities, the characters were lovable and oddly realistic, and the ending slipped by not being too cheesy for passing. Huzzah! I'd recommend this to be watched while in a good mood, with someone you don't mind laughing and making a fool out of yourself with. Three cheers for Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon, making it on the silver screen!"
53,Monster House,3,15 June 2006,"Technically proficient, but lacking in art, Monster house fails to engage","The computer animation technology used in this film is some of the best I have seen, nearly photo-realistic in the case of inanimate objects, but it left me with the question ""why was this animated?"" Frankly, live action would have at least had some, well, life to it. Unfortunately despite the technical proficiency, the overall feel is very cold, and the characters are unlikeable and poorly developed. The tone is very uneven, swinging wildly between trying to establish a sense of real peril, and cartoon goofiness. For example, twice a very realistically animated character is struck by a moving car, but the character bounces back utterly unharmed ala a Warner brothers cartoon, which leaves one with a weird disconnect. The voice acting was good, but the character animation fails to convey much physical emotion, and leaving one feeling disconnected. Ultimately the movie was loud, shrill, and mostly boring. Pixar need not fear any competition just yet."
54,Monster House,1,30 July 2006,Much too Sinister  and Disturbing to be a kids' movie!,"I have read a lot of the reviews on this movie, and contrary to what it seems most of the other people thought, we hated it. We almost walked out of the theater. Seven of us, of all ages, went to see this movie together, and the highest rating it got from our group was an ""okay"" from my nine year old son. For the younger kids it was terrifying and we had to leave the theater. From the previews it looked like something we'd really like and we made a point on vacation to see it at a theater in 3D. The animation was well done, but I didn't like most of the characters and it was more like an episode of ""Supernatural"" than a kids movie. The plot seems like a rehash of the popular horror genre TV shows. The poor attempts at humor are really sad. A couple of short giggles a couple of time is all we heard in our theater. The beer drinking and sexual suggestions DO NOT belong in a kids' movie! I hated the way the all parents were portrayed as stupid, immoral, and uncaring! All the threatening and abuse of the kids was disturbing. What can I say, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time! It turned out to be nothing like any of the commercials we had seen marketed it and it was a horrible way to end a wonderful vacation. There is so much that is disturbing and inappropriate about this movie and it should NEVER, NEVER have been marketed for kids and families, or ever even made as far as I'm concerned! I will be telling every parent I know to avoid this one like the plague!"
55,Monster House,1,27 July 2006,Inappropriate,Very Very inappropriate. I took my little bro to see and we left right at the beginning. Wjhat type of babysitter is a liar. and brings friends over.Then the friend is like french kissing the little bunny of DJ's. Not appropriate at all. BAd for kids.........Don't. SEE........ NOt for little kids...... THE COMMERCIALs don't make it seem this way but it NOT funny not smart. y add those kind off things. I Didn't LIKE IT ONE BIT!!! !!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! A don't see movie. Instead watch pirates of the Caribbean it is appropriate the worst in it is kissing and violence........now that movie is a must-see .... don't waste money on this film
56,Monster House,,31 July 2006,Don't Bother with the Non-3D Version,"Good luck staying awake for this movie, I barely did. The animation is interesting at times, but it takes too long to get to the point, and when it does you can't believe that's all there is to it. If you've seen the previews, then you've already seen all there is to see about this movie.The movies main saving grace is that at times the animation almost appears to be real life. Some of the close-ups and character movement was done well. And actually, I didn't realize there was a 3D version. The 3D would have made this movie a lot better. But the non-3D version that I saw; you'd have better fun watching old Buggs Bunny and Roadrunner cartoons from Saturday morning. A huge disappointment!"
57,Monster House,8,28 July 2006,"if you ever wondered what a Spielberg/Zemeckis-produced Goosebumps serial novel would look like, this would be it","Goosebumps, if not familiar, was a series of novels from the 90s which dealt with various spooky, unexplained, supernatural, and just plain weird stories meant for kids to take in in all its simplicity and imagination (or re-imagination to put it another way). Monster House is kind of like one of the books never written put up on the screen with an extra dosage of some funny moments and lots of visual tricks up the animator's sleeves. It's directed by first-timer Gil Keenan and written by a group that seems like they're more into older-animation (or at least not usually for the kiddies) and other comedy by their career rosters. But probably the biggest reason I decided first to see the film was because of the exec producer credits belonging to Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg. I'm not sure what their input was on the film, but it feels like one of those 80s era horror film or adventure type works that they were attached to (Poltergeist, the Goonies, and a few of Zemeckis's recent horror movie productions come to mind). It's a family horror comedy that actually has some characters for kids to connect and root for, with a little more development past the conventions, and a host of supporting characters that are actually as funny for adults and older teens as they might be for kids.And the creativity in the animation department is some of the best I've seen in non-Pixar computer animated films so far. The house itself, possessed by a dead fat woman named Constance (Kathleen Turner surprisingly enough), is quite the marvel that really does make a good chunk of the enjoyment in the picture. The little twists and dark turns inside the house are like the best possible clichés of a haunted house turned inside out with added human-features (including a good joke about a part of the anatomy at one point). When the film goes into its final act and the house then literally lifts off of its foundation after the kids, it really becomes an entertaining spectacle where cliffhanging moments are abound and there's always time for a grin. In fact, it's really something to see how the humor in the film is not overly juvenile or predicated on excrement jokes, but more on behavior and stuff kids relate to- being talked down to, boys clumsiness around girls, and fears of what may possibly be where they'd rather not look.And making up the characters is a very good voice roster including Steve Buscemi as the old man Nebbercracker, Fred Willard & Catherine O'Hara as the parents, a nice crop of talented kid actors (Mitchell Musso, Sam Lerner and Spencer Locke), and others like Jason Lee, John Heder and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Like a good kid's horror book it delivers on some interesting bits involved in the mystery of the crux of the story, while as an animated feature it delivers on being engrossing (and fun) entertainment in its execution. It's also a blast, if you happen to get the chance, to see it in its limited run in 3-D. In short, I'm sure if I was younger I would've liked it even more, but as it is it's one of the more successful diversions in animated film this summer."
58,Monster House,4,30 October 2017,Spoilers: The movie was okay/bad,"The reason for my rating is that it was kinda crappy animation. you could clearly see the cuts between scenes. The reason that I don't give it 1/2 in a rating, is because it hides some small details, like when you could see, when the house where first defeated, you could see the box that contained dynamite where The house originally was. The character arc was surprisingly developed with the two perverts fighting over the same redhead. There were some dirty jokes in there, like when Chowder said ""I know that place. There's a taco bar at the corner of that street!"" ""I hate Mexican food,"" said Jenny ""Yeah, me too!"" Chowder proceeded to say. If I could give it a 4,5 at the rating, I would."
59,Monster House,7,25 July 2017,Excellent graphic animation!  7 Stars!,"I was baffled by the graphics and what they got an animated movie to do. I'm so curious about what goes into the making of an animated movie such as this. I've been backstage at Disney to watch how they created an animated film years ago, probably 80's. But I haven't been recently and it would be intriguing to see how it's done and put all together. What are the easy parts and what are the difficult parts, ya know? This movie is cute, but a bit far-fetched. It's still good though because of the quality of the animation these days and what they can do with it. Impressed! Great work! This is a good movie for small children to watch, particularly around the Halloween Holiday."
60,Monster House,8,24 May 2017,"An Old, New Halloween Classic","With shades of October classics like Monster Squad, Monster House is a halloween movie just about anyone can enjoy. Though on the outside it may look like a ""kids movie,"" it doesn't pull its punches and isn't afraid to put our heroes in legitimate danger, leading to the same sense of joy one would get when watching a movie like The Goonies.Part of what makes it such a joy is the movie's overarching mystery regarding the titular house itself. The secret to successful horror is to keep the audience guessing, and Monster House is great at this. There's a few big mysteries lurking inside the Monster House, and the movie takes its time building a tangible, winding suspense. The monster itself is absolutely awesome in motion, and some of the most creative use of visual effects out there.But... about that. This is one of the movies to use Robert Zemeckis' ""performance capture"" technology, which is an overly complex, incredibly expensive way to take real people on real sets and digitize their movements into computer animation. The more stylized, claymation-esque aesthetic of Monster House makes it less creepy looking than Zemeckis' other movies (The Polar Express and A Christmas Carol) but it still veers too close to the uncanny valley in some scenes. Characters can vary wildly between looking like puppets, cartoon characters, and unsettlingly realistic people in a way that can look a little gross. Without getting in to a debate about the value of real animators and hand-crafted animation versus using a computer to auto-digitize the movement of physical actors, I'll just say that this performance capture stuff continues to look wholly unnecessary in Monster House, but it doesn't spoil the movie. It just didn't need it.Monster House didn't just exceed my expectations, it juked around them like a football player. Every time I thought I knew right where this movie was going, it took a left turn, and kept me entertained the whole time. It's a kids movie that almost feels on the edge of not being suitable for children -- and if you ask me, those are the best kind."
61,Monster House,7,16 March 2017,An Animation For Both Audiences,"Having horror in a kid's animation is rarely seen and can be a risky move since being too scary can lose the child audience while not being scary enough can lose the adult audience. However, Monster House is able to appeal to both audiences really well although it could be scary to some kids during some scenes. So let's start with perhaps the most important part of any horror movie:1.Horror: While the horror present in Monster House would be considered scary to little children, it is enough to entertain adults. Perhaps the scariest part of the movie would be when a cement covered body disintegrates and leaves a skeleton behind. The design behind the house is also creative and is a very threatening character. Also, the disturbing ideas help make the movie more interesting for adults and help to challenge adults instead of being a cheerful movie.2.Animation: The animation in Monster House is quite impressive (for the time) and looks like claymation in the close up shots. The film also features many impressive scenes were characters come out of shadows or the scene focuses on one item while another is in the background. However, there are some scenes that look really funny which may be due to the fact that the film utilizes motion capture. As mentioned before the house is really well animated and transforms naturally and smoothly.3.Characters: Another strong attribute of Monster House would be the characters. Almost every character is well acted and fits naturally in regard to each other. As well as the main characters being excellent, the side characters are amazing as well and add some fantastic humor to certain scenes. 4.Humor: Speaking of humor, the humor present in Monster House is more for adults then children. Perhaps one of the best characters would be Skull, a stereotypical gamer who is seen as a god to the main characters. However, as an adult it is clear that he is a loser. In the end Monster House is a decent animation. While it isn't the best animation, it is quite entertaining and can be fun (and scary) to both children and adults due to the humor appealing to adults while the horror is for children. Final Verdict: 7/10"
62,Monster House,,29 December 2016,Gil Kenan's best is also his hardest work,"""Monster House"" boasts a top-notch crew, memorable voices that fit the characters perfectly, a great story, an ingenious backstory, and a twisty ending. With plenty of recognizable voices in the film, and a beginner's luck choice of cast, the actors are a nice mix. Steve Buscemi, Nick Cannon, Kevin James, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Lee, Kathleen Turner, Catherine O'Hara, Jon Heder, and Fred Willard, any kid below 15 should see this film. Besides the my opinion that the film should've been done in live-action instead of this...kind of animation, it's reasonable by me, to let them show a possessed house fully eating a police car, with 3 kids still screaming in the back of it. Weird, but still a good film."
63,Monster House,,27 December 2016,admirable,"its first virtue - the science/courage to be more than a demonstration of technology. to have a story, full of clichés but touching in the final part. and this is real a good thing because it is a rare case when entertainment is mixed with a story who gives more than horror moments, fear and tension. a story of friendship and love, full of memories about old fairy tales, exploring the need of adventure of each generation of children and using the secret truth as the best part of an animation who translates the vision of a great director and the joy to tell the right story in the right manner. so, a well known story who preserves a beautiful surprise. and this is the best detail - to impose the image of a world who becomes more and more familiar but has a nice and useful fundamental meaning."
64,Monster House,3,23 December 2016,"Exaggerated, morally debatable, not advisable for all children.","This film revolves around the obsession of a small group of children with an old neighbor, living in an old house. The neighbor, Mr. Nebbercracker, rudely drives away the children who will knock on his door or play near his house, stealing the toys that are left in his lawn. Obviously, grown-ups don't want to hear the suspicions of the little ones, who believed that something is wrong there.This movie deals with four things: privacy, private property, fear and monsters. Initially, the old neighbor looks just like an old man who does not want to be bothered or wants anyone stepping on his ground. So far he has every right to do so, and we must see the behavior of this children as a mere voyeurism. They have no right to spy the old man or get into his private life. Its only with the development of the film that we actually find that the children were right in their suspicions. Anyway, we condemn the fact of this film, in a way, encourages voyeurism. The life of others should not be more interesting than ours. Aside from this moral detail, the film's story is good and solid. I also thought the ending of the movie was very exaggerated.The film features voice actors such as Steve Buscemi (the old man), Mitchel Musso or Kathleen Turner. I think they all did a good job, according to our expectations. Animation was done in a very interesting way: contrary to the general trend of looking for realistic animations, this film decided for a more classic, stylized look. This made it different, with some pleasing originality. I don't think it's the right movie for young children, given the content mildly associated with horror and the moral options we already spoke. Discernment and care of parents and adults is key to understanding whether its appropriate or not. Either way, it's a family movie, where grown-up kids are likely to feel more at ease than adults."
65,Monster House,6,26 January 2016,A Great Idea is about all this Movie has to Offer,"I hadn't seen this movie in years, but loved it as a kid. When it hit Netflix I decided to give it a re-watch. While it wasn't nearly as good as I remember, there were still some great things about it. The plot of Monster House is interesting. There's a haunted house across the street where a crazy old man lives and steals kid's belongings. Only this time, there's a twist to the house and it's owners. Unfortunately, the house itself is the best part of the movie. Everything else is just okay. Gil Kenan had a great idea, he just didn't know what to do with it. The characters aren't great either. While some of them are just forced in simply for the sake of a female protagonist, others just end up coming off as kind of dumb. Sure, they're young, but they're still not very good at following common sense, even for their age. None of their life problems seemed particularly well-developed or original either. This movie suffers heavily from its animation style. It's kind of ugly. The movements are fine and everything, but some character actions end up looking unfinished or just awkward. The overall look of the characters is very unappealing, which really made it hard to get through the movie at times. The movie was over way too quickly. Towards the end I wish they'd drawn out some parts, but instead they just briefly touched on them and rushed to the climax. The climax was pretty awesome though. Overall Monster House has an awesome idea, but that's about it. The plot isn't well-developed, the characters are cliché and underdeveloped, and the animation looks unfinished. While the climax was awesome, it wasn't enough to save the entire film. In the end I'd still recommend giving this movie a watch. It's got some really great ideas that I wish could have been surrounded by something better, but it's still worth your time, even if it's only for the ending."
66,Monster House,5,3 January 2016,Worrying trend?,This film was recently screened on Australian television. I quite liked it although as a person who is obese I felt uncomfortable about the villain being an enormous woman. But what concerned me the most was the cynicism and throw away comments by children about (1) the police and (2) the government. I am very much aware that some people in the USA perceive the government as the enemy and the government is responsible for all possible ills. I found amazing the response by some to the proposed changes to health care - the hysterical outbursts and cries of give us back our country. So I was disturbed that during this children's film one of the characters states words to the effect of 'you cannot count on the police' and then 'I hate the government' and 'the government never helps you'. I should imagine most thinking and intelligent people would advise their children to seek out the police if they are in situations which are dangerous and most thinking and intelligent people recognise that in a highly industrialised and complex society government is vital to assist in management of resources of to ensure that individuals do not exploit the weak and that vulnerable people are taken care of. I hope the writer of this film gets to read this comment and takes it on board. Do we really need to put biased and cynical opinions into the mouths of children in a children's film? I think not!
67,Monster House,8,23 October 2015,"Good Movie, If Only Parents Won't Stop Shading.","You know i am getting tired of how parents complain about how awful the movie is, yeah there a few themes that are not suitable for children but if you are so concerned about your children being corrupted by a simple movie? Then might as well control everything they watch. Because honestly they will see and hear things worse at school. The movie had it is flawed but it isn't a bad movie. The movie should be given a lot more credit, overall it doesn't have anything badly. A lot of movies for children put adult humor for the parents sake, and the children won't exactly understand so why try to diss on a movie that certainly deserves some credit?"
68,Monster House,8,2 July 2015,This House Should Never Be Entered By Children.,"Monster House (2006): Dir: Gil Kenan / Voices: Mitchel Musso, Sam Lerner, Spencer Locke, Steve Buscemi, Maggie Gyllenhaal: Chilling family animation about facing fears, particularly those that inhabit a child's imagination. The house across the street is rumored to be haunted, and its owner elderly Nebbercracker gets cranky when kids or anything enter the property because they disappear. This captures the attention of twelve year old DJ who, along with his best friend, the chubby Chowder, are nearly devoured by the house when it shapes itself into an evil expression with a red carpet that rolls out acting as a tongue. They are eventually joined by Jenny, who was rescued by the duo when she attempted to sell Halloween candy there. After a dog, two cops, and DJ's babysitter's boyfriend disappear in the house, they make a daring rescue attempt. Creative screenplay until it reaches a ridiculous climax where the house roams about like Godzilla. Directed by Gil Kenan with nifty animated segments, unfortunately this may be way too intense for its intended audience. The children are drawn well enough to relate to with Steve Buscemi voicing Nebbercracker, whose motives are given a heartbreaking back story. It contains a strong message regarding facing one's fears. It is not viewing for really young children but older children may wish to enter this house, accompanied by their parents, of course. Score: 8 / 10"
69,Monster House,7,24 October 2014,And I turned into a couch potato.,"Few months back when Monster House (2006) was on TV; I tried to resist watching it as I was busy with doing something but it was too interesting to miss and I turned into a couch potato. It is a horror comedy revolving the tales of Domus Mactibilis and a group of children who are determined to unveil the mysteries of that living house in order to defeat it. The film sets in a beautiful neighbourhood during the Autumn, around the time when children are trick-or-treating for Halloween. There are also several likable characters and certainly, there are plenty of hidden mysteries. Some parts of the film doesn't make sense but with realistic personalities, engaging storyline and characters that are so mean to scare children, it is truly an enjoyable watch.Most importantly, Monster House (2006) doesn't bore. This relatively unknown film is not new but it's not that old either; I just came across this film recently yet it has already impressed and imprinted on me. True that the whole film seems to lack of other living beings around the neighbourhood, that doesn't mean it is not entertaining and it should be out of anyone's watchlist!PS. Domus Mactibilis is supposed to be terrifying but I find the Monster House so adorable and pretty. *-*"
70,Monster House,10,19 October 2014,One of my favorites,"When I first saw this movie, I was about nine or ten and I walked in on my younger brothers and neighbor watching it. At first, I refused to watch it because I deemed it ""too scary"", but I allowed myself to sit down for 5 minutes. I ended up watching the rest of it and loving it. I turn seventeen next Sunday and this movie to this day is still one of my absolute favorites. WARNING: SPOILERS: The only thing that truly scared me about this movie when I was younger was the haunted phone call and the eerie moaning on the other end. I was worried that whenever I answered the phone, the same thing would happen to me. The final 20 minutes of this movie are very intense. Personally, I don't remember being scared of it when I was younger, but take caution if you watch this with young kids."
71,Monster House,10,15 October 2014,Monster WIFE!,"I was first drawn to this film after reading that it was written by none other then Dan Harmon, creator and HBIC on the hard hitting college drama Community. I knew that I was in for more then just your average children's horror movie when I sat down to watch Monster House. As to be expected, Harmon takes the genre to new levels, and addresses that which we fear most: fat wives. After Years of being emotionally tormented by his dead fat wife Old Man Nebbercracker has a heart attack on his front lawn. The attack raises the concern of 3 neighbourhoods children, who then take it upon themselves to free the old man from his wife-imposed shackles. This film explores married life and is a metaphor for how divorce and untimely death is sometimes the best thing for everyone. This is an excellent children's movie with a fantastic message. 12 golden apes up, but 5 down also, bringing Monster House a total of 7 golden apes (the equivalent to 1 platinum squirrel)"
72,Monster House,,11 May 2014,seductive,"a nice film who search to mix the horror, Gothic themes, realistic childhood reactions and a high animation. and the result is not bad at whole. interesting is the manner to not create another 3 D animation but a story with soul.and that does it not only for children because the rehabilitation of old themes is a smart idea to remind to adults many classics and, in same time, the children reactions is a good point for atmosphere and for conquer the young public.because it has the flavor of old fashion literature for children - mysteries and adventure, the superiority of child against adults image about reality - all is at perfect place . in fact, nothing new. the content, after end, reminds a lot of same stories but the package gives new nuances to them. a film for entire family. and that is all."
73,Monster House,10,25 October 2013,In my house,"Both 2005 and 2006 had been some year for animation. Loads of CGI and hand drawn animation came out on the big screen and to DVD. Some animated movies failed way back then, and others became Box Office smashers. Also this animated thriller Monster House. Some kids lives in a quiet suburb that looked like the one I been raised in as a little kid. But the different is that a monster house and a strange old man lives there. So the kids must save the nice suburb from that scary house on Halloween. There are scary moments, funny scenes and beautiful animation. The animators must had fun with this. If you and your kids want something for this Halloween go watch this. Well deserved Oscar nomination. 10/10"
74,Monster House,8,12 October 2013,Good motion capture animation in a fun 80s horror,"DJ is a suburban kid living opposite cranky neighbor Nebbercracker in his old crumbling house. Nebbercracker never lets anyone on his lawn. His best friend Chowder is a chubby loser. When Nebbercracker dies, somethings seems to be happening in the old house.The motion capture animation is pretty good for that era. I think it was really smart to place the movie in the 80s. It has a more innocent feel without all the technological gadgetry. It's the perfect time period for a haunted house movie. This is a good scary kids movie. It benefits greatly from the Rear Window start. It also benefits from all those great 80s horror movies. It has all the sense of those movies except they did it on the computers."
75,Monster House,7,4 September 2012,A must-watch for Animated movie lovers !,"Interesting movie ! A good watch for both adults and children. The animation was neat and story-line is a little mature to be branded a kids movie. I do want to mention a scene from the story that really didn't click to me. Although, I understand It's an animated movie. The part where the house is uprooted and starts chasing the kids & Nebbercracker was a bit unrealistic. Where were all the people of the town ? Wasn't a single soul out there to help and could hear all the ruckus ?! Just a thought. Overall, this is a movie that will keep you glued to the screen. Get your TV on, on a lazy weekend and get ready for a Spooky adventure."
76,Monster House,,29 August 2011,Good Halloween movie for the kid in all of us,"I personally remember the day this movie came out and it made me think to myself this looks like a family oriented film. I saw it and found out how wrong i was. Not only does it have a lot of scenes that i wouldn't recommend for small children but some of the jokes and gags will not be understood to children possibly younger then 9 or 10. The story is about a boy who believes his neighbors house is haunted. The story is pretty predictable at times but their are a few twists and turns that some wont see coming. A lot of veteran actors appear on this movie such as Jason Lee, Steve Buscemi, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Kevin James. The rest of the cast are mostly people from kid shows but overall the cast is funny and strong. This movie is indeed perfect for the season of Halloween, if you intend to watch it with kids however be warned of its content before doing so. I want to give this a 10 because it is a really good film, i enjoyed watching it and watch it all the time with my family every Halloween, its kind of a tradition for us now. I hope this helped to inform you if you would like it or not and just remember not to expect anything shocking or mind-blowing but its still a fun film nonetheless."
77,Monster House,8,23 September 2009,Best animation of 2006,"After his evil neighbour dies, DJ (Musso) and his friend Chowder (Lerner) become obsessed with his house that appears to be haunted by the spirit of the neighbour.Pixar are undeniably the finest animators in the market. Their last 5 movies have showcased all new meaning to the genre and competitors are left scratching their heads in a resolve to finally pip the Toy Story creators.2006, I believed, was a pretty poor year for animation. Cars was below par for the masters of animation and Happy feet was a degrading and predictable collection of penguins, and somehow it beat this spellbinding picture to best animation Oscar! Monster House showcases a normal everyday kid who wants to grow up but is still living in a young lad's world with his childish best friend Chowder. The simple understanding nature of the script is easy to sink into and whilst DJ may be a conventional lead character and Chowder the less good looking and more slow and silly stereotype, the familiar nature of the plot is easy to sink into and enjoy. These two bring the laughs with their conspiracy theories that no one believes and their antics in the industrial sight come the end may be highly unrealistic but are good fun for the target audience, which is most likely the family.However what is worth mentioning is the nature of this film. The house which comes to life and eating random people is quite a startling ideology for a family flick so if you have young ones in the room you may be wary. For the more adult viewer its quite refreshing to see a bit of spookiness in an animation and see it significantly work. The house has al the attributes of a monster. The carpet as a tongue is ingenious and the door teeth are likeably comic. What grabbed me about this film as well was the interesting twist that was placed on the house in the final stages, something that will delight many.The script is wonderfully woven into a mystery regarding the nature of the house and though occasionally annoying the two main characters bring in the laughs with the younger audience. The inclusion of Jenny is refreshing and adds a spark to the humour element. Not to mention the two cops are hilarious.The quality of filming is exquisite but not on par with Pixar. The opening montage of the floating leaf is good, if a bit too long. The house's many splinters and reformations in the finale are impressive graphically also.This is a springy good fun film that brings the laughs and light hearted enjoyment for the family.It may not have the punch of other animations but as far as I can tell, it was certainly the best animation of 2006, by a long stretch."
78,Monster House,10,7 July 2009,Movies about evil houses have never been this much fun.,"As I recall,I went to see this movie at Cinema Cafe for my 10th birthday.I think it was my 10th.Or was it my 9th? But anyway,I was given a chance to see one of three movies: 'Cars' or 'Monster House'. I forgot what the third choice was.But I ended up choosing 'Monster House', and if I didn't,I probably would've regretted it.The movie itself is as alive as the house is.It's funny,scary,action-packed,and a boatload of fun.Just like any other animated film,there's also a fairly good cast.Jon Heder,Nick Cannon,Fred Willard,Maggie Gyllenhall,Jason Lee,Kevin James and Steve Buscemi did an excellent job in this movie as much as everybody else did.This is one movie that just can't be missed.With a huge cast that I just mentioned,this movie is nearly impossible to love."
79,Monster House,8,25 March 2009,"Not a lot of hype, but worth watching","This isn't a movie that got a whole lot of hype but it's actually one of the best animated films I've seen, and also a good movie overall, animated or not. The characters were original, and believe it or not, the acting (or voices) was good. It was very clever, and the jokes were quick and almost non stop. You do not have to be kid at all to enjoy this one. Kevin James and Nick Cannon come through big playing the two police officers. They add comic relief to an already funny movie. Great original story, lots of laughs, great action, great characters, and a very visually pleasing movie. Go grab this one, trust me you won't regret it."
80,Monster House,9,15 October 2008,Perfect for Halloween Time,"I am a big fan of horror movies and Halloween movies in general. I also really love Halloween movies that I can view with my whole family. This movie falls into that category. Usually, ""family"" films are pretty cheesy and just poorly written. This one isn't. It's actually a very clever little film that could sit next to Disney's Sleepy Hollow, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and James and the Giant Peach.The animation looks great and sets a good feel for the film in general. There are some really good ""scary"" moments as well. I really loved the story and thought it was one of the most well thought stories I've seen in a ""kids movie."" This movie is great for this time of the year. Be sure to see it soon because Halloween will be over before you know it!"
81,Monster House,7,23 September 2008,Monster House,"DJ: ""Chowder, your ball just landed on Nebbercracker's lawn. It doesn't exist anymore..."" A suburban home has become physically animated by a vengeful human soul looking to stir up trouble from beyond the grave, and it's up to three adventurous kids from the neighborhood to do battle with the structural golem in this comically frightful tale, directed by Gil Kenan and featuring the voices of Steve Buscemi, Nick Cannon, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Kevin James. DJ (voice of Mitchel Musso) lives directly across the street from a most unusual house. A malevolent entity that longs to feed on the energy of the living, the once peaceful house that looms ominously outside of DJ's bedroom window would like nothing more than the chance to feast on the children of the neighborhood. As Halloween begins to draw near and the children of the neighborhood prepare for another long night of trick-or-treating, it appears as if it may be the house that is in for the biggest treat of all. Now, with the adults turning a deaf ear to DJ's strange findings, it's up to the brave young boy and his faithful friends Chowder (voice of Sam Lerner) and Jenny (Spencer Locke) to break through the barrier of the supernatural and defeat the powers of darkness before the house grows too powerful to fight.A highly amusing kids movie produced by Robert Zemeckis, one of my favorite directors, and is directed by Gil Kenan which apparently marks his film debut with this movie. The visuals looked so delicious on screen and you can't help but be amazed at what kind of animation style they got going on in the movie. Apparently, they used live motion capture which is like, the in-thing in Hollywood right now when it comes to the animation business. No wonder the facial expressions of the CG characters were so accurate and almost like a real person. Gone is the day where the animation people have to draw every move of a certain character in hundreds of pages and flip it like a notebook.I always enjoy animated films like these, you don't have to really think of the story because its a kids movie and just leave your brains out the doorstep and just enjoy 90 minutes of good, clean, animated fun."
82,Monster House,9,21 September 2008,One of the best animated movies I've ever seen.,"I'm a hardcore horror fan, and I also seriously love animated movies because they're a break from my normal ultra-gory viewing lineup. As a kid, I also loved the Goosebumps books and pretty much any other children's horror fiction out there as well. Monster House takes all my loves and puts them into one, flat-out amazing animated movie.For someone who isn't a horror fan and just wants another Finding Nemo, you're really going to be disappointed here. There is little humor or heartwarming scenes, but a lot of classic horror elements with a punk, childish twist. If I had to make a live-action comparison, Monster House would fit somewhere between Donnie Darko, Halloween, and The Shiningall toned down enough for a PG-rating, of course. However, with the tone-down, it also manages to have a plot that is far superior and creepy to a lot of live-action, R-rated horror movies I've seen.Overall, this is a must for any horror fan with a childish side. Period.9/10"
83,Monster House,7,29 August 2008,"A lot of potential here, not quite realized","Too many American directors think that have to fill their movies with ""whiz, bang, flash"" in order to make a point. Spielberg is one of those directors. Subtle, he's not. Nor is he very original. The influences of Alfred Hitchcock, Ray Bradbury and Disney were just a little too obvious. And good technique is not enough; there has to be some substance in order to make a movie great. I almost got seasick as the sharp geometric perspectives in this movie made it feel more like a virtual reality roller coaster than something that I could just sit back and enjoy. Having said all of that, this movie had some very good things about it: wonderful color sense, decent characterization, a Halloween atmosphere that was very appealing. It was just overdone, that is all. Disney knew where to draw the line; Spielberg clearly does not."
84,Monster House,5,12 August 2008,Questionable animation technique,"As a rule I love CGI animated films - especially those by Pixar - so I was optimistically biased heading into this film. I was almost immediately disappointed as the animation was, in my opinion, very substandard. After browsing other reviews, it seems animation was done mostly through motion capture as opposed to hand animation. Given this, one would expect much more fluid and life like movements, but I found the opposite to be the case. The animation of the human characters felt clumsy and choppy to me, as if the animations themselves were under 20 FPS. Character's expressions seemed to be lacking any animation whatsoever of non-critical facial areas, leaving the human characters with a puppet-like, certainly not life-like, feel. Additionally, the animated world seemed underpopulated. I was left with the sense of a lonely world where the only characters in existence at any given time those that were absolutely critical to the plot.The movie itself was decent with an average story, but the script definitely lacked the finesse or oomph of a typical animated film. Jokes often fell flat and I found myself feeling embarrassed for the actor's at times (the cast is stellar).Overall, this movie's story, script and animation felt to me more the caliber of Jimmy Neutron, or some other TV kids show. Good, but not worthy of the big screen."
85,Monster House,9,2 August 2008,Very Entertaining,"This movie was very entertaining for me and I really enjoyed it. The story was kind of unique in way because you don't see that many movies where your neighbor's house comes to life. Basically the movie is about this crazy old guy named Nebbercracker and he doesn't like anybody near his house. So anyways DJ one of his neighbor's gets caught on his lawn and Nebbercracker yells his head off until he collapses. Sooner or later DJ notices that the house is alive and he is on a mission to find out the special secret that the house holds.Now to the main characters which are DJ, Chowder, and Jenny. Now DJ is the mature one, Chowder is the immature one, and Jenny well I guess she's apart of the girl scouts who is selling candy. My favorite character out of all of them would probably be DJ mainly because he's the only one who really sticks out and the most serious one out of all of them.This is definitely one of my favorite movies and is definitely worth buying on DVD."
86,Monster House,6,28 May 2008,Passable family movie fun.,"My Take: A decent animated comedy, but not a great one. Way behind of the computer-animated movie race, Sony Pictures Animation launched MONSTER HOUSE in 2006, and with some professional help from thrill masters Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis, it turns up pretty well and enjoyable, even if it doesn't hit the same ground as FINDING NEMO or SHREK, which set the comparisons among recent animated films. Even when it isn't right on that level, this film is a lot of fun, and it makes for decent family entertainment.The secret juice comes from the screenplay, which is basically a horror movie for kids. It tries to be creepy, funny and be a for-kids entertainment at the same time, which it succeeds on for most of the time. The story is a mixture of POLTERGEIST, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR and THE GOONIES, and only the GOONIES part didn't work for me. The kids in this movie grow pretty annoying at times, since once again, it targets on a couple of misfit kids. Still, so much about the plot works, where three misfit kids DJ (voiced by Mitchell Musso), Chowder (voiced by Sam Lerner) and Jenny (voiced by Spencer Locke) who team up to fight an abandoned house which may just be alive.The supporting cast are the real stars, as they are voiced by some really great actors. Steve Buscemi voices the neighborhood grouch named Neberkracker, Maggie Gyllenhaal voices Z, DJ's teenage babysitter, Jason Lee voices her boyfriend, Kevin James voices a cop and Kathleen Turner is underused but scene-stealing and creepy as Nebercracker's deceased wife. The voice cast is superb and grabs most of our attention for the entire film. The script is also filled with numerous energetic moments, much of which are very enjoyable. the comedy is quite uneven, which is either funny and often corny, but overall fun. This is a decently enjoyable animated family comedy, energetic and I'm easily recommendable.Rating: *** out of 5."
87,Monster House,6,11 April 2008,"An interesting house, but seems too dark for kids.","When Monster House came out in theaters, I thought it was one of the types of films that I didn't want to see (even though I simply love 3D animated films). But after actually seeing the movie it surprised me. While not great, it is entertaining with some wonderful cinematography. The story of Monster House sounds like something from the Twilight-Zone and the premise is an interesting take on the stereotypical cranky old recluse everyone seems to have in their neighborhood. However the plot stretches kind of thin along the journey and near the end things start going overboard in the traditional Hollywood fashion. What surprised me most about Haunted House was the subtle detailed cinematography and camera moves used in the animation. They really added depth and atmosphere to the film making things actually nerve-racking at times. Which causes the biggest problem for me. This is a children's movie at heart. The style, way the story is told, and the main characters are all geared towards a child audience. But the atmosphere developed seems pretty dark, dealing with characters dying (so we think while watching), children finding a corpse, and other situations you would not normally want to find children in. So the film seems not totally appropriate for the the audience it would seem to be made for. However for adults, while it might not be everyones cup of tea, it is enjoyable and a fun ride to take."
88,Monster House,10,11 February 2008,This film delivers more treats than tricks!,"""Monster House"" was the second animated movie release behind ""Cars"" but with a little more edge compared to the moral life lessons from the Pixar team for a summer movie.The premise of ""Monster House"" has DJ, a young preteen going through the stages of puberty, spying on his neighbor Mr. Nebbercracker from his telescope where he notices there are more than just things wrong with the old man. After his parents leave him, DJ's friend Chowder goes over to play until their basketball moves inside their curmudgeon's yard where the old man goes after both boys before getting a stroke. Afterwards they discover that something fishy is going at the house where they realize it has a life of its own. The windows are the eyes with the door being the mouth where not only is it keeping an eye on DJ and Chowder, but consumes anything from humans and objects that walk by. Nobody believes the duo until a prep girl name Jenny almost becomes devoured by the house where it's up to the trio to do something about it before anybody else gets in harm's way.Monster House may be a little frightening for children, but it's not one to give them nightmares. The film itself was made using motion sensor imagery where the actors both young and old had dots around their bodies to capture every detail for the movie itself. The young trio of actors are a marvel delight for which I cheered for them all the way and I was also surprised to see the list of credits from wise guy Steve Buscemi as Nebbercracker along with Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara playing DJ's parents. Jon Heder, A.K.A. Napoleon Dynamite, plays the aid of the young boys while Maggie Gyllanhall plays DJ's babysitter.The film may have lost the best animated feature to ""Happy Feet"" since the academy liked the ethnic penguins and heart morality more than the frights of this funny caper; but there is no way I'm avoiding this movie, especially on Halloween."
89,Monster House,4,24 November 2007,Writers on Acid,"Let me preface this with the fact that I'm 17 and watched this movie with my brother (25) and his girlfriend (28). We watched it expecting something along the lines of Shrek or Ice Age. What came out is what I can only describe as writers on acid. After the first few minutes, we only watched out of morbid curiosity. If I were younger, this would definitely be fodder for countless nightmares.The whole movie is animated well, the conversation flows easily. I just think that they forgot who their target audience was, the CHILDREN under the age of 13 that go to see this movie. If this had come with an appropriate warning and information that this movie was NOT suitable for people to bring children to, that'd be a different story. Crazy plot though."
90,Monster House,9,23 November 2007,Very good.....,"There are 2 types of animated films: 1-A selfish character makes friends, learns to be unselfish and learns life lessons. 2-a character must do something, but has a problem of doing it. Monster House is none of them. Well, maybe number 2, but it's made to entertain people, not teach them a life lesson on unselfishness and kindness. Why does Cars win on ""The best animated film of the year award?"" Cars is just a simple storyline, nothing new. Monster House also has a simple storyline, but the movie is GOOD! It is mature, obviously designed for the seven years and over, but still, very nice. I highly recommend it. With a storyline so simple and a finale so amazing, it's a wonder it didn't get the best animated film of the year award."
91,Monster House,7,7 November 2007,good animation,"i was really knocked off of my feet how good this movie was. it was almost as good as over the hedge, except this time it's all humans,, yeah a couple of parents, the babysitter, the boyfriend, and the rest all kids, which is good, the movie is about a house who after the owner get's carted off by the ambulance, the house starts acting very peculiar, the kid who lives across the street spays on the old man , with the help of his friend , and a girl selling cookies they team up to match wits with this ""horror house"". the special effects were pretty good in this one,, if this is the way animation is going, then i'm all in,, this was a great movie for the kids,, say 10 on up.. and i think good for adults too, this movie along with over the hedge, makes me want to see more kids movies,, especially the animation kind."
92,Monster House,6,15 October 2007,What neighborhood doesn't  have a...Monster House!?,"Adventurous animated feature; CGI enhanced and at times constructed with visual brilliance. ""Shrek"", ""Nemo"" and even ""Cars"" fear not; MONSTER HOUSE is just not THAT good; but nonetheless a hoot to watch. The photography is better than a lot out there. Some of the humor may actually go over the heads of the prepubescent throngs with eyes glued to the bright and colorful screen. It helps to have well liked characters. DJ(Mitchel Musso)lives right across the street from an old house owned by Mr. Nebbercracker(Steve Buscemi). DJ and his friend Chowder(Sam Lerner)lose a ball to the crotchety geezer, who has a heart attack before the boys can get their ball back. The house takes on a life of its own, gobbling up the ball...just an appetizer before gulping up innocent animals and foolish trespassers. A new friend in the neighborhood Jenny(Spencer Locke), yes...a girl, joins forces with DJ and Chowder trying to convince anyone who will listen to the unlikely story of the freaky activities of the Monster House. Other voices giving life to this macabre little tale: Catherine O'Hara, Jason Lee, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Kathleen Turner, Kevin James and Fred Willard."
93,Monster House,7,1 October 2007,Good fun,"Monster House is a great animated film for both children and adults combining atmospheric visuals with an original story sure to be remembered at least on premise basis. In some respects, I did notice at times that I was watching a film aimed at younger audiences, particularly when the story began to get repetitious and when it climaxed in a typically fluffy way, but for the most part Monster House served as good entertainment, especially for the eyes. Perhaps the best thing about Monster House is its artistic style which fully brings the possessed house to life superbly, creating a character out of a normal everyday structure. The only time I got a little weary of a house that had life was near the end of the film where it starts walking around, but even then it was a complete joy to watch. There are also some major pacing problems near the front end of the film, where it stalls for quite some time, hardly progressing plot or character. Small details such as this did hurt the film as a whole, but nevertheless I enjoyed the film and will probably give it a few watches again sometime. Good, light and originally beautiful entertainment for the whole family."
94,Monster House,7,30 September 2007,The ending was a bit boring but the rest was great!,"Monster House is a very good movie. However, it may scare younger kids. It also has flashing images so it you are prone to seizures you may want to avoid it. The cast for this movie was great. Having kids play the main characters instead of adults playing kids was a very good choice. Nick Cannon and Kevin James are very funny in this movie. They play two crazy cops. Jason Lee who plays Bones made me laugh. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a nice choice. Her character was half nice half bad. In fact the only bad thing I can say about the cast is I wish Jon Heder had more time on screen. I only remember him in two scenes and you may miss him in his last scene. The animation was just fantastic. This is very advanced animation. It's not just walking into a room and putting your voice in the cartoon. They were acting it all out. Spencer Locke played a very strong role in this. I've never seen her in that much. Overall good but may scare younger kids."
95,Monster House,9,4 September 2007,It Shows That Kids Films Can Be Dark When They Want To Be,"After bad overly happily bad kids movie that have taken over the industry (Happily N'Ever After, etc.) CGI world needed something dark, something original, and Monster House was just that.Now I'm not saying that you should get the DVD for a six year-old, there are some really dark, and arguably... violent, scenes. All the characters are well-rounded, and the plot never gets to dull, and the black comedy is always high-key, and I mean how often do you get a CGI film with Spielberg credited as producer let alone a comedy. And there are some really scary stuff and violent in there, but being a family movie, the scares aren't half as good as Jaws.I say I rather liked this movie, it's a must-see."
96,Monster House,7,30 July 2007,Delivering some fun but nothing new,"This movie is not bad but it's just the same old thing. The children see something creepy about the house in their neighborhood that the adults cannot see, so they try to do heroic thing like breaking the spell of that house. Actually, this kind of plot can be made into a better movie, but unfortunately, this film doesn't give anything more than just a few thrilling moments in the first half of the film when the mystery of the house is still unrevealed. After that it is plain Hollywood stuff that you've seen over and over again.The climax of the film is so predictable that it made me feel bored.Well, the children will enjoy it though. They like to watch something fun anyway. But this movie doesn't give them anything to think about. The story doesn't deliver any theme. At least it should try to say more clearly that it is not right to make fun of an obese woman.By the way,I just don't understand why nobody in the village come out to see what's going on when the house turns into a monster chasing after the children. And what happen to the people and the dog that the house has eaten in the first half of the story.(We only see one of them climbing out of the house at the end of the film.) Anyway, one good thing I want to say, the voice of the main characters are natural. They did good job on the voice part.In conclusion, if you really have nothing to do, you can watch this movie for some fun. But don't expect too much. It's just the same old thing."
97,Monster House,9,18 July 2007,Do Not Enter! But Watch The Movie!,"MONSTER HOUSE was an entertaining movie to see. I seen this with my sister and I thought this was a cute movie. But there are some faults, actually one fault. I did not like how the old man changed from an old, mean man into a caring man who loves children. That seemed too common in a children's movie. So I take one star for that because that really annoyed me. Everything else was just fantastic.It's about boy who discover a house whose lawn eats anything that touches it. Also, his friend was there. Anywho, they decide to be brave and enter the house. That is when all the fun starts happening.I do not remember this movie quite much, even though it has just been a year but I recommend this movie for anyone who loved Toy Story, Toy Story Two, Finding Nemo, and the Incredibles.. And more movies that has been created by Pixel. Although, I don't think this movie was created by them. I also recommend this movie for children, teens, and adults. This was a very cute movie."
98,Monster House,7,29 June 2007,Not for Adults,"This is a good movie, for kids. I am 18 and I just watched this a few hours ago and was bored. This isn't a movie for adults though. If you are an adult you will not be entertained. Saying that, it is a good movie. You have to look at what the movie is. There are adult movies and kid movies. You cant rate it like an adult movie. Just like a burrito and pizza are both foods but you wouldn't rate as burrito on how much it tasted like pizza.Is it a good kid move, yes.also, for the people who said it should be PG-13. Grow up. Your kids will be fine. I've been watching R rated movies and playing M rated games since I was 5 years old. I understand how something OK in a game is not OK in life."
99,Monster House,8,16 June 2007,A terrific scary movie for kids and adults alike.,"What a treat.After several disappointing CGI efforts from the big names in the business, Monster House came as a pleasant surprise. Consistently entertaining, with fabulous animation, a great creepy storyline and some nicely realised characters, this is one scary movie that the whole family can enjoy.DJ lives opposite grouchy old man Nebbercracker, whose favourite pastime is scaring the local children and stealing their toys when they land on his lawn. After their basketball lands on Nebbercracker's turf, DJ and best friend Chowder make a brave attempt at retrieving it, but are stopped in their tracks when they realise that the house itself is alive and also on the lookout for naughty kidsto eat!Aided only by Jenny, a precocious prep school girl (who both the boys take a shine to), the plucky kids decide that a ravenous house has no place being on their street and set out to destroy it.Monster House's wonderfully twisted plot also includes mean spirited babysitters, the mistreatment of sideshow 'freaks', and dead bodies in the basement, meaning that it is not only enormous fun, but quite disturbing too. Sensitive kids might be best kept away (the little wusses!). The rest of us will love every minute of it.With top-notch voice talent (Maggie Gyllenhaal, in particular, is great as Zee, the babysitter-from-hell, and full marks also go to Nick Cannon as rookie policeman Officer Lister, by far the funniest character in the film), inventive direction, and some very dark humour, this is a great film to introduce kids to the wide and wonderful world of scary movies."
100,Monster House,6,6 June 2007,"Cleverly-pitched horror flick for kids, thinly plotted but generally quite well made.","Many kids like that experience of being scared without being actually harmed. That's why they like rollercoasters so much, which drop them from great heights at terrifying speed without placing them in real danger. It's also why they like creepy horror stories. Sadly, some kids are exposed to adult horror movies before they're really ready  it just isn't appropriate that a young thrill-seeking kid should get hold of a copy of The Exorcist or The Shining or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The gore, the sex, the language, and the incessant nature of the horrors in such movies, are aimed at grown-ups not kids. Monster House caters, very cleverly, for a specific target audience  this is the movie for those kids who like horror but aren't quite old enough for a hell-for-leather adult horror flick. It has jumps and scares, moderate violence and creepy characters, but it rationalises these things with appreciative touches of humour.Inquisitive kid DJ (voice of Mitchel Musso) lives in a regular suburban house. On the other side of the road is the dilapidated home of Mr Nebbercracker (voice of Steve Buscemi), a ranting and roaring old guy who constantly terrorises the kids in the neighbourhood and has a particular penchant for keeping any bikes, kites, balls, etc, that land on his yard. DJ spends much of his time spying on the Nebbercracker house through a telescope in his bedroom, convinced that something just ain't right about the place. One Halloween DJ's parents go away on a trip, leaving him at home with teenaged babysitter Vee (voice of Maggie Gyllenhaal). Aided by his friend Chowder (voice of Sam Lerner), DJ decides the time is right to prove once and for all that Nebbercracker's house is every bit as deadly as it looks. The pair of them get more than they bargained for when they actually witness the house turning, before their very eyes, into a monster and eating up passers-by. Unable to convince anyone of the truth - other than a pretty girl named Jenny (voice of Spencer Locke) who survives an attempt by the house to digest her - they realise that the only way to save the neighbourhood is to destroy the ""monster house"" before it can do any more harm. But how, exactly, do you kill a house? Monster House is brisk, efficient and amusing. It's reminiscent of an animated homage to the Tom Hanks' movie The 'Burbs, with much of the action taking place on a seemingly quiet street and lots of bizarre characters coming and going throughout the story. At no point does the film attempt to come up with some ground-breaking plot twists or eye-popping surges in animation. It's just a simple, small-scale spook story told in a simple, small-scale way. The voice work is OK  Buscemi is probably the best of the bunch as the cranky old guy  and the music adds a subtle eeriness to the proceedings. Just when the horror aspects threaten to reach too intense a level, the makers knowingly pull back and treat the audience to a wink and a joke. No classic, but fun while it lasts."
101,Monster House,7,21 May 2007,Great fun,"""Monster House"" is hands down the best kids adventures movie in a loooooong time. It's fast paced and exciting. So why wasn't it a huge hit? The giant flaw of ""Monster House"" is that it doesn't really have a definite target audience. It was definitely a problematic decision to turn this story into an animated movie. Make no mistake, the animation is perfectly executed and it has the advantage that the house can practically do anything without having to look a hundred percent realistic. However, animation has the negative side-effect of attracting a young audience. For really small children this movie may be a tad bit too spooky, however. Grown-ups, on the other hand, will find the story of a monster house a bit, well, childish. That's a shame, because this movie has been realized so perfectly.The script is terrific and filled with witty and charming dialog. From a technical point of view, it's a joy to see how characters, places and devices are established, so they can be used later on. But of course this movie isn't just a technical exercise. Most of all it has a lot of heart and its 80ies-ish look and the suburban setting references classic movies like ""The Goonies"", ""The Monster Squad"", ""Poltergeist"" or ""Halloween"".The movie would probably have had a bigger audience if real actors had portrayed such memorable characters as Chowder, Officer Landers or Officer Lister. Still, ""Monster House"" has the potential of becoming a real child adventure classic over the years."
102,Monster House,10,8 May 2007,What a pleasant surprise!,"I have seen every kid's movie from America known to man. I am a big city mama with an eye for the beautifully crafted. With life-like body movements and expressive yet cartoonish faces, a blend of photorealism and cartoon, this movie was more than I was expecting. It is perhaps the most beautifully realistic animated film known to me, with all the spunk of the brightly sunlit Toy Story, but with so much more depth through shading and textures. It kind of looked like a computerized stop motion at times. The story was fun and clever, not too scary (my 5 year old liked it too), although not for the really little ones... all I'll say is it's like Amityville Horror meets Toy Story meets The 'Burbs meets What's Eating Gilbert Grape."
103,Monster House,8,21 April 2007,"Good Story Idea, Great Execution, But Not For Younger Children","From a small child's perspective, this movie is scary. Point blank and period, it's NOT for younger children. But your older youngsters will love it.There are a few twists in this animated house version of Fright Night, which lead the audience into an inner examination of bravery and courage. But above all that, this is a purely entertaining, though thoroughly recycled, venture.This work reminds us of Fright Night, Monster Squad, the Goonies, Ernest Scared Stupid, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Hocus Pocus, Peter Pan, and about a million other movies, in that the kids tell the grown ups that something weird is going on, and of course, the grown ups don't believe them.It's fun, but nothing new.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :."
104,Monster House,6,13 April 2007,Not a kid movie!,"Okay, this definitely was not an animated movie for kids. It was too scary. The story was O.K. Three kids are going to enter a haunted house before the house takes a lot of kid victims on Halloween.The movie got my attention, because I was curious what was going to happen to the kids. But after seeing this movie, it wasn't that great to watch it a second time, or over and over like great movies as Shrek.In the movie some people disappear, like two policemen. What happened to them I don't know. The boyfriend of the babysitter's character disappears too, but at the end he shows up again, so where are the policemen?Weird movie."
105,Monster House,8,5 April 2007,Monster House rocks!,"The idea of adding reference points to actors as an aid of creating a base for an animated film is not entirely new, but Monster House uses this to create a very entertaining film, in which both the actors and the production team evidently enjoy themselves, as both the actors movement and their voices are used, and the 'cinematographers' can choose their camera angles very late in the process, long after the actors have moved on to other things.As a film it is somewhere between Toy Story and Miazaki's films, the entire story taking place in an idyllic American suburbia, where one house is different from the rest.Good for any age, I would say, and the extra material on the DVD is superb! Awaiting with eager interest the next film using this technique!"
106,Monster House,6,18 February 2007,"Not as Magical as It Could Be, But Fun to Watch","I have been a fan of feature animation since I was a child. Since the advent of computer-animated features in the mid-1990s, I believe that this technology has the potential of growing ever more powerful with each passing year. But there is a caveat: Power is useless if you don't know how to use it.And on that note, I give you ""Monster House"". In this film, some neighborhood kids believe a house occupied by a crotchety old man is haunted. Many of us can identify with this kind of tale; even I knew of a house or two in my old neighborhood that no one went to. The lights are never on, the landscaping is shoddy, it's in some state of disrepair. Whatever the reason, a house like this becomes the subject of some exaggerated urban tale among the 11-to-13-year-old set, and it just seems to grow wilder every month. There have been other films like this in the past, my favorite of which is ""The Sandlot"", and there are moments in which ""Monster House"" tries to duplicate that sense of exaggeration, but it doesn't quite succeed.The technology behind the making of this movie was groundbreaking, in that it's not a traditional CG-animated film. Instead, it uses motion-capture technology to enhance the performances (by both the actors and the characters), as well as a new kind of editing platform that allows for a more ""organic"" feel to the camera motions (even a hand-held effect). For that, I was impressed by the look of this movie. ""Toy Story"" (1995) will always be a classic, but this technology would have made it a different movie with a completely different feel to it.Overall, the characters were fairly well-rounded. Even though I thought Mr. Nebbercracker's motivation was a bit hokey (to say why would mean a Spoiler Alert), I still found it somewhat believable. I did enjoy the actors' performances in this movie, too (they didn't just speak -- they acted on a motion-capture stage).Still with all the cool technology and the director landing his ""dream cast"" (watch the Special Features, and you'll see what I mean), ""Monster House"" turned out to be an enjoyable movie, but not a magical one."
107,Monster House,8,12 February 2007,Terrifying in spots - not for littlest ones - but lotsa fun,"As time goes by, we become inured to the magnificence of the cutting-edge techniques found in animation. Remember when Toy Story came out, and we were all ""Woo! Awesome animation! It's so... so lifelike!"" And then with each passing year, we were more ""Eh, looks nice. It'll keep the kids entertained."" The resultant ennui with 'toon films has forced animation studios to be even more innovative.So for Monster House, images of the actors providing the characters' voices were captured using 3D motion techniques; then the animated form of the characters was added as a top layer, producing a level of clarity and articulation that approaches that found in live-action films. It's really pretty neat, but there's a caveat: Because of the enhanced realism, the movie can be frightening to young children. When Wile E. Coyote attempts to drop an anvil on the Roadrunner, no one's terrified that a bird's gonna be splattered all over the place, because everything looks.. well, cartoony. Unrealistic. Taking place in someone's vivid imagination. But take that terror and multiply it by two or three and then make the whole shebang as realistic looking as possible, and your fright factor is exponential. (Sorry, didn't mean to involve math there.) D.J. (Mitchel Musso) is a loner/nerd whose parents Just Don't Understand. He also keeps tabs on the house across the street, the kind of house every neighborhood seems to have - a spooky-looking old manse with a spotty history buoyed by decades of gossip and innuendo. The house's sole occupant is Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi), your standard ""Hey you kids, get offa my lawn!"" mean old man. (In the opening sequence, he grabs a little girl's tricycle and destroys it.) Something's fishy about Old Man Nebbercracker and his house, but D.J. can't convince his hands-off parents (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara); they in turn hand him off to a virulently nasty babysitter named Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who doesn't give a rat's ass about D.J. or his babblings about mean old men, she just wants to hang out with her boyfriend Bones (Jason Lee) and smooch.But D.J. is not without backup. His best pal is Chowder (Sam Lerner), a portly, crewcutted lad who acts about forty times faster than he thinks, which makes for high comedy. They've been buds for a long while, so when an entrepreneurial Girl Scout clone shows up to sell candy, they both compete for her affection. Of course, this subtle story thread takes a back seat to the ominous house across the street, and D.J. and Chowder team up with their new pal Jenny (Spencer Locke) to solve the mystery. But is this an ordinary tale of a crotchety old man who hates kids? Or is there something more sinister at play? The title of the movie might provide a subtle hint.The characterizations are wonderful, with the troika of Lerner, Musso, and Locke perfectly essaying the dynamics of childhood interactions: the two best buddies, the interloper, the first love. You honestly believe these are real kids acting out real situations and facing their fears of the unknown, older people, even puberty. Such natural-seeming acting isn't simple for anyone, especially novice actors, even if they're providing only a voice. Gyllenhaal is sweetly menacing, and I wish I'd seen/heard more of O'Hara and Willard. Kathleen Turner, who provided the voice of Jessica Rabbit once upon a time for producer Robert Zemeckis, shows up as the voice of the titular house, and although we don't hear a heck of a lot of her, what we hear is choice.As I mentioned before, one issue with the movie is that the violence can get pretty intense at times. I mean, the house is ALIVE and eats people and pets and toys. There's no blood or dismemberment, certainly, but kids are in constant peril, and it all feels so much more real than your typical cartoon that for really young tots this might be a little too nerve wracking. I actually looked at the screen at one point and said, ""This movie is messed up!"" the hair-raising, children-in-harm's-way would make for a decent thriller/horror movie if it were live action. Hey, I'm not saying I was scared, mind you! I'm just looking out for the kids. Yeah, the kids.Anyway, Monster House is loads of fun. It's genuine scares and thrills combined with a real ear for how kids interact with each other. A winner."
108,Monster House,8,10 February 2007,It's gonna be a bloodbathMonster House,"I really wasn't sure what I'd be getting with the new film from Robert Zemeckis, utilizing his technology from the enjoyable Polar Express. I have been intrigued by the buzz I heard saying that Monster House was a bit darker and scarier than parents initially thought when taking their children. Also, being nominated for the animation Oscar, along with the wonderful Cars and utter garbage Happy Feet, I put the DVD in with some nice anticipation. Thankfully the animation is leaps and bounds better than the oddly shaped characters from Expresscan't wait to see where they go with Beowulfand the plot line has just the right mix of off-the-wall humor, moments of pure terror, and good old-fashioned family fun. True, while I wouldn't recommend taking children much younger than 10 or so, if that, I would still urge you all to check out this gem of a film.When you have a plot involving a house that eats whatever lands on its lawn, whether it toys or even humans, you expect to leave all sense of reality at the door. Surprisingly, the writers and director never delve into a true fantasy world, but actually personify this house into a character in and of itself. There is no Disney-like cuteness or fantastical magic; this house truly is a beast to be reckoned with. The adults, and their lack of imagination to believe what their children tell them, leave the job of saving the neighborhood to the three misfit kids nerdy dorks DJ and Chowder and their new overachieving prep-school friend Jenny. What the film results in is the best tale of kids against supernatural odds adventure since the classic 80s movies The Goonies and Monster Squad. I really had a lot more fun than I ever would have expected.Definitely notice the amazing talent pulled together for the voices. Although only on screen briefly, Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard are absolutely hilarious as DJ's parents. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that they improv'd their whole role much like they do in Christopher Guest's mockumentaries. While the kids were great, especially the goofball Chowder voiced by Sam Lerner, it was really the supporting players that made the film. Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfect as the dual-image babysitter and Steve Buscemi as the misunderstood cantankerous old man who owns the titular house. The ones who really shine, though, are Kevin James as the corny cop trying to do his job with a twitchy rookie partner, Jason Lee as the babysitter's boyfriend (why did he look like he was 40 years old though?), and Jon Heder as the video game/comic book guru Skull. Heder's short scene is pure gold. How can you not love a film that succeeds on all levels, from children to adult situations, with lines like Chowder's, knowing Jenny was in the room and that he had just hung up on his father, yelling for his dad to shut-up, slamming the phone down, and asking DJ if he had a beer? There were priceless moments like this throughout, and they truly made this a worthwhile viewing for the older crowd, while maybe a bit too risqué for its target audience."
109,Monster House,8,10 February 2007,Very Dark and Very Good.,"One thing I wasn't expected was how dark the film was. There are a lot of content of in the story that are actually pretty spooky even for the grown up. But, whoa that animation is brilliant, absolutely stunning.Synopsis: D.J lives a crossed the street he believe is the monster house. Inside lives an evil old man that likes to talk to his house and terrorize neighborhood children if they ever came across his house area.Almost everything about it is very well done. This Oscar nominated for best animation truly deserve to be in there. Though the story is pretty dark it was very well written, and I like the fact that all the three main characters are very well balance and the pace of the movie is interesting from first minute to the end credit. Chowder is what to look out for in this, he is lovable character with a lot of sense of humor. I get a lot of laugh and smile from him. The actor also did a pretty great job with the voice.The style of the film is nothing that I normally seen that usual. It was good, the hair was like a plastic but at the same time everything moves like it suppose to be. The directing also is brilliant, much better than expected. Though it adds effect to the movie a dull sky and town was a bit too dull for me. It makes it look very depressing.Recommendation: Yes, Worth A DVD.Reason To Watch: Brilliant Animation, Great Story and Direction. Funny.Reason Not To: A little too dull.Rating: 8 (Grade: B)"
110,Monster House,9,31 January 2007,Strangely Watchable,"I watched both this and Cars in the same day.This is miles better with no competition at all. It might look more cartoony and animated than Cars but it's hand drawn innocent appearance has much more appeal than Cars' over drawn, over polished and frankly over thought illustration methods.This film uses a new technique which has only been used in The Polar Express, which is known as performance capture. This is an improvement on motion capture and I expect it to be used far more in the future.This is a tale about the scary house that everyone has in their neighbourhood. Everyone has a house that they thought things about when they were kids, so this film will appeal to adults, kids and big kids all alike.I'm not going to reveal too many details of the plot but the lead boy DJ reminded me of Hogarth from The Iron Giant (they look so much alike). His friend Chowder looks excellent and is well played and their girl sidekick whose name escapes me is also very well played.Watch this film to enjoy the visuals, enjoy the amazing acting and a very good original story which is well thought out and is almost a perfect length (I would have liked maybe another 30 minutes or so).Watch and enjoy, I did."
111,Monster House,2,18 January 2007,"Boring movie, too many genres?.","I did not like this movie, very boring almost all the time. The movie got me sleepy, so i dozed off at least for 30 minutes. The story was not very interesting and you don't want to see this movie if you are the kind that want to see a movie that's not boring more than 5 minutes. The animation is OK, but the movie is as said boring. An amateur movie that is taped picture for picture while changing a doll's movements is better and funnier. I think all the genre's this movie goes under is a bad thing, make it one or two genre's and you have a better movie without all the boring stuff. But, we all have different opinions so if you think you will like it go see it or something. ;)"
112,Monster House,6,17 January 2007,Certainly Not Up To Awards Standards,"The Golden Globes are over and their new Animation Category has been added (2007). And anyone who thought MONSTER HOUSE had even a remote shot at winning this award must've been smoking crack. Up against HAPPY FEET and the awesomely entertaining CARS, Monster House was the lemon in the animation ranks. Even though the animation was good (actually these things are more a cartoonish CGI than animation), the story missed by a mile.More interesting than the story itself was the manner in which it was made. On the extra features of the DVD it shows how small, electronic balls were attached to actors as they read their lines and acted out the parts, allowing the CGI animators the ability to track every facial twitch and finger movement, thus making the animated characters move in a more life-like fashion.I don't usually mention the MPAA ratings of films, but here I'm going to make an exception because this supposedly kid-friendly film is rated PG, not G. My guess is that the violence and the one off-comment about female anatomy (""Oh. So it's a girl house."") forced this rating on the film (just something for those stickler parents to be aware of, although I'd be willing to bet your little kiddies get more information from the Victoria Secrets catalogue in your monthly mail and more bloody viewing on the nightly news).The story is about a dank house on a quiet street. This house is inhabited by a crazy old coot named Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) who guards his property with rabid ferocity. Any toys that end up on his lawn are immediately confiscated and never seen again. Across the street from Mr. Nebbercracker lives D.J. (Mitchel Musso). He's infatuated with the dark and dreary house, and spies on it via a telescope from his upstairs bedroom window. And when D.J.'s parents head out for the weekend and put a babysitter in charge of D.J., things start to get interesting. The babysitter's boyfriend vanishes, and D.J. instigates an argument with old man Nebbercracker, only to have the crotchety man fall over with an apparent heart attack. An ambulance takes Nebbercracker away and the house now sits vacant on the verge of Halloween eve.D.J.'s best friend, Chowder, comes over, too, and when D.J. tells Chowder about the strange goings on at the vacant house, Chowder doesn't believe him and decides to play doorbell ditch. But when he rings the bell, the house comes alive! The spirit of ...something lives in its walls.As the boys try and figure out what's going on, they also encounter an entrepreneurial young cookie sales-girl named Jenny whom both boys become somewhat enraptured with; Chowder and D.J. are, after all (so we're told), approaching puberty.Initially the boys and Jenny think that old man Nebbercracker is dead, but his unexpected return changes everything they once thought they knew about the old, scary house.Although loaded with plenty of action, scary scenes, and funny buddy dialogue, the story is simply not up to par. The fact that D.J. is approaching puberty has nothing to do with the story's end result and is given way too much emphasis throughout. The babysitter (Maggie Gyllenhaal) also has little to do with the story and appears more as filler than anything else.Even so, the animation is interesting and the action will keep most viewers watching. Just don't expect Happy Feet or Cars and you'll probably do just fine with Monster House."
113,Monster House,10,15 January 2007,Solid Story; Excellent CGI,"I have lost the thrill of watching a CGI made movie. The last one I saw I panned it b/c it had no story. This movie ""Monster House"" has restored my interest by having a solid story. I cared about the characters and sat at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I forgot how a well written story can take up the slack in other parts of any program. (A good example of this is the BBC TV production of ""Dr. Who."")To augment a solid story you have the CGI. The CGI is excellent not b/c the characters looked real (as in ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"") but b/c of their facial expressions. They were so detailed and life-like that I had a hard time imagining them as anything but human. (Of course in scenes where the faces weren't central, then the reality of them being cartoonish was apparent.) BUT if you watch this, pay particular attention to the faces of the characters, it will amaze you how detailed and subtle they are in their motion. A+ job - as I have never seen in any CGI flick.This one is a keeper - like Monsters, Inc. and Ice Age, it made me feel like a kid again. Excellent story, truly subtle CGI makes this a 10 out of 10 in my opinion.-LD_____________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/"
114,Monster House,9,13 January 2007,What a treat.,"This movie was a lot of fun, and in spite of the PG rating is fine for young kids in my opinion. My three year old loved it, and cuddled up tight to me and laughed at the scarer bits. That is a great way to spend a hour and one half.The animation is very good but occasionally a bit too dark..I like to see what is going on not have to guess.The characters likable and fun particularly the three leads: DJ Chowder and Jenny. I have to mention the the King of Video games too, very funny.A good movie well worth watching with your family."
115,Monster House,8,9 January 2007,It scared my 6 year old into laughter on the way home.,"Lets take this film for what it is on the surface. Its an animation that target older children whilst providing something for teenagers and adults at the same time. The animation is of a new format that may not please all, but is far superior to that of many Japanese animations and a pleasant change to the usual Disney styles we have become used too. There are lines in there that if you don't listen well, you will miss that give the film its adult humour.I expected another dreary wrong-to-right story line with morals and lessons learnt at the end, but there was none of that. All of the main characters are the same throughout and none of them came out thinking 'I'm glade I learnt from that experience'. The fact that this film went right to the brink of being a 'PG' without falling off the edge into the '12' certification was a masterpiece of film making on Dreamworks part. My six year old son went from the regular seating position, to being on the edge of his seat, to then standing behind the seats in front and then finally back into his seat again. All of this in the first 20 minutes. Superb.Give it a go for sure."
116,Monster House,8,5 January 2007,"""Whatever Disease You Guys Have, I'm Sure It Has Letters And They Make Pills For It."" --- Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal)","""Monster House"" (2006) Directed By: Gil Kenan Starring: Mitchel Musso, Sam Lerner, Spencer Locke, Steve Buscemi, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Lee, Kevin James, Nick Cannon, Catherine O'Hara, & Fred Willard MPAA Rating: ""PG"" (for scary images and sequences, thematic elements, some crude humor and brief language) The horror genre is on the downfall. With movies like ""Rest Stop"" and ""Mortuary"" ruining everything such innovative horror directors as Alexandre Aja and Rob Zombie have worked for and with nearly every horror movie being either a watered-down remake or a bloodless, dull PG-13 schlock-fest, I too am beginning to wish Hollywood would take a break from the horror genre, except, of course, for those filmmakers who have proved to be great horror creators. When I first say the previews for ""Monster House"", I thought it looked fun--the typical family movie. To my immense surprise and pleasure, ""Monster House"" turned out to be a frightfully creepy movie that hit the nail on the head when it came to balancing between entertaining adults and entertaining children. It is very sad when a family movie--yes, a movie directed towards both adults and CHILDREN--sports better scares, more suspense, and a creepier premise than seventy percent of actual ""horror"" movies released. Have we pulled an Alice and stepped through the looking glass into another world, where everything is backwards, or is Hollywood just more screwed up than ever? I vote for the second and, after seeing ""Monster House"", you will toobut, regardless, I'm grateful for these filmmakers. ""Monster House"" is the refreshing surprise I have been waiting for.D.J. (voiced by Musso) has been cautiously surveying the house across the street for quite some time. He knows that something is strange about the place, as well as its lone resident, Nebbercracker (Buscemi), but every adult simply shrugs him off, blaming it all on his vivid imagination and puberty. When his best friend, Chowder's (voiced by Lerner) basketball rolls into the yard, D.J. goes in after it and has a run-in with old Nebbercracker himself. As the two struggle, Nebbercracker suddenly collapses and is whisked away to the hospital. Soon afterwards, D.J. and Chowder realize that the house is alive and that it will eat anyone who comes to close. As it is Halloween, the two buddies, along with their new friend, Jenny (voiced by Locke), begin a battle against the house before it can claim any innocent trick-or-treaters who may be wandering by in search of candy. But, stopping a demonic house may prove to be more difficult than they ever imagined. There goes the neighborhood. With a plot like this, some parents may think that it will be too intense for their young children. They are, actually, right. This movie features a few scenes that are actually quite frightening. This movie is more oriented for people above the age of seven, I would say. Kids who are younger may find the movie to be a little too scary.When ""Monster House"" ended, I knew that it was one of the best animated movies of the year. It's an engaging movie, entertaining, and it doesn't dumb things down for children. The characters in the movie are, surprisingly, realistic. The writers clearly have an understanding on how many preteen boys think. The wonderful animation is the cherry on top. It looks fresh, original, and perfectly eerie. The animation itself lends much to the overall creepiness of the movie. On the dark side of things, I found the last act to be a little too long-winded. The scene in which the house chases the three youngsters seemed to take too long and, when everything was being wrapped up, I felt somewhat like I was watching ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" again--you know, you kept thinking it was over, but then it kept going back for more. Also, the movie could have had a bit more ""scary house"" moments--not the roaring, clawing, fighting house at the end--but the moments that effectively used suspense, such as when we are waiting for the house to attack and know it most certainly will. These scenes were incredibly amazing and were the most effective moments of all. They should have been more thoroughly maximized. When the door to ""Monster House"" was closed an the shades were pulled down, I knew that ""Monster House"" is the kind of animated movie I want to see. Like ""Cars"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Finding Nemo"", Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""Ice Age"" and ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", it knows the true meaning of the term, ""Family Film"".Final Thought: Oddly enough, ""Monster House"" will please everyone, from hardcore horror fans to family audiences.Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)"
117,Monster House,,5 January 2007,Stunning and totally lovable,"Monster House was really good, especially since I saw it in 3-D at my local movie theater. I own the DVD. It was stunning that the Monster House was Nebbercracker's wife, Constance. And, of course, the final battle scene was a blast! It was a little scary, but totally lovable. I don't recommend it for children under 8 because it's kind of scary. Just the same, it nearly claws to perfect on the scale of four stars. I think this movie deserves ***1/2.The animation is great. It was used with motion capture by the actors in the movie. As a final review, it's such an awesome movie. Don't miss it. You will have a blast."
118,Monster House,7,28 December 2006,Avoid this film little children!,"I saw Monster House & I have to say that even though this is intended to be a kids CGI film it has some scary scenes I think anyone who is under 9 should avoid this film until you're older or else you'll have nightmares for weeks. Besides that, I really enjoyed this film! Steven Spielberg can pull off kids adventure movies & really made me wanna get into the story. Gil Kenan exceeded at his 1st Hollywood film & he should do more! The writing in this story was ls amazing, everything came together like a puzzle as the story progressed. Anyone who likes kids adventures will enjoy this! Enjoy the movie & have a good time but keep it away from young kids."
119,Monster House,10,26 December 2006,What a delightful movie.,"What a fantastic movie! What else do we expect from the creative minds of Deamworks! Excellent plot arc and the dialog, relationships, and special effects balanced all together to make it an enjoyable movie! I heard of the plot sometime ago and I said to myself, oh it is going to be some pre-teen dribble that will only cater to that age group; but I was pleasantly surprised that it was not. The thrust of the whole movie on the development of the characters and the situation that they are in. Sure there are some ""factual"" flaws, but you know what, who cares! Example: The Goonies. Kids missing, one kid ""Chunk"" kidnapped, criminals, murder, and at the end of the movie no guns drawn at the criminals as they come to shore. Monster House was not meant to be factually correct, but entertaining. So bust out the popcorn, the soda, turn down the light, and raise the volume and get ready to be taken into a world of mystery, creepiness, and lots of fun."
120,Monster House,8,25 December 2006,Wish I could have seen it in 3D..,"Before I had seen this movie, I was expecting a more horror based children's film. Instead I got a really fun and laugh out loud mystery/adventure film. Not to say that there isn't horror implications. With Halloween going on, the parents on a business trip and a formidable house across the street, this movie has all the necessary components. Genres aside, this is a great movie for children and kids at heart alike. It offers a lot of clever and fun humor that can please both demographics. Not to mention, the animation is as state of the art as I've ever seen,which is a joy to watch. A recommended film for anyone that enjoys Tim Burton's films or cartoon romps."
121,Monster House,8,24 December 2006,Animation at its very best,"This is by far one of the best animated films ever. It is not aimed at children and I advise you to leave the younger ones at home as it is a horror film. The film blends together horror, mystery, suspense and humor into one brilliant package.Monster House centers around a boy named DJ who is just starting to go through puberty. DJ has been spying on the house across the street for quite some time, as the owner Mr Nebbercracker seems to be hiding something.He notices that every time something or someone is on the lawn, especially children, Mr Nebbercracker goes mad and sometimes the people or objects disappear. DJ and his best friend Chowder witness Mr Nebbercracker's insanity when Chowder's new basketball lands on the lawn.Nebbercracker collapses, leaving the two boys in a state of confusion. Strange things seem to happen in the house when the owner himself isn't living there anymore. Soon they meet Jenny, an intelligent young girl from the neighborhood. Both boys seem to take a liking to her.After seeing that no one will believe them when they tell people about the house's behavior, the trio decide to investigate deeper into the mysteries of Nebbercracker's house. But while they're at it, they face many obstacles and uncover shocking details that they never would've dreamed of. After all, the house is alive.The animation of this movie is phenomenal. The film was animated using performance capture. The animation is performed by actors whose facial expressions and movements are transferred to CGI animation.The characters are excellent in every way. They are memorable, relatable, and designed brilliantly. The film has elements of horror and humor and isn't afraid to go to lengths that most animated films haven't gone before. The suspense and mystery is riveting.I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this masterpiece. All animated films should be made the way Monster House was. They shouldn't be afraid to take risks, they should have other age groups besides children in mind and they should entertain the audience non stop. Monster House is now one of my favorite animated films."
122,Monster House,8,3 December 2006,A Great Animation Film!,"Although the film's title already gives you a hint on what the plot is, I'll just explain it to you: This film is about three teens who discover that the neighbors house is really a living, breathing, scary monster!This film is very enjoyable and could win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. The cinematography is great in this film, which separates this from other animated films. Some says this might be too scary for young kids. I don't have a mind of a seven year old but I could point out some scenes that could be scary for them.Newcomers Mitchel Musso, Sam Lerner, and Spencer Locke is good in this film. The supporting cast roles are also good. They make the film funny. And this film have being the first film by Gil Kenan is great. I can see a bright future ahead of him.Although not great, the animation looks good, using motion capture animation, since The Polar Express, which was another great animated film. Some scene looks amazing. This film is a mix of kiddiness, horror, action, and adventure.If you want to see a good, fun, entertaining film, watch this! It's fun for kids and adults with some scares and laughs!"
123,Monster House,10,2 December 2006,A great movie,"The reasons for people rating this movie below a 7 are mind-boggling to me. This is a great film. The target audience is for PG by the label but it works on different levels that only an older audience would understand. It is not for children, and some people rated this movie poorly because it certainly does have some scenes and situations which would frighten a young child. I, however, am in my mid 30's, and rented this on whim. I rarely rent animated movies that are rated PG, but I was pleasantly surprised. The animation is great, and Steven Spielberg isn't exactly a bad director. I laughed quite a bit at the ""inside jokes"" intended for the older more mature viewers.It is a PG film by design, but the only reason I see in rating it poorly is if you let your 7 or 8 or 9 year old watch it and have to suffer through their week of nightmares.Aside from that, if you're all grown up, it's a good watch. Especially if you have nice equipment to watch it on."
124,Monster House,10,8 November 2006,Great imagination!,"The best horror movie ever seen by me! It has great imagination that only Steven Spielberg could generate. The beginning of the movie with the little girl singing on the bicycle was very funny. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh. Halloween is a time of tricks and laughter. Monster House had both of these things. To think that a house had a uvula! When you first watch the movie, you think it's a nice and peaceful movie. But as you get further into the story, you find that it is really enjoyable, but not as nearly as peaceful as the beginning. If you watch this movie, I assure you, you will get screams and thrills as well as laughs! (Lucy Kerslake,Australia)"
125,Monster House,6,1 November 2006,Not what you'd expect,"This movie was not entirely what I expected and was actually fairly entertaining. It was an unusual mix of animation and horror that was done very creatively and did do some new animation tricks that were entertaining to watch. The voices of the characters were competent but not very memorable. The difficulty with animated movies is you need to have those characters whose voice leaves a mark on the movie. For example, no one will ever forget Robin Williams as the genie in Alladin. Love him or hate him, but you will never forget his voice when you see that genie. This movie lacked that natural interest.The movie is worth a look especially if digital imaging interests you. The artistic quality of this movie is superb and the graphic artists were pretty effective at creating an unusual movie genre, the children's horror movie."
126,Monster House,6,31 October 2006,Intense But Very Flawed Horror Movie For Kids.,"Monster House is funny and threatening in about equal measures, and considering its main character DJ is ""growing up"" and beginning to learn what the world is like beyond his front lawn, it has just enough of those creepy real-world details to give it that sting of unfairness. The warped, angry babysitter Zee and her ghoulish rock 'n' roll boyfriend are good examples of this natural human wrongness come to occupy and abuse his (basically normal and balanced) parents' household. The first two thirds works fine, mainly because it feels real.This is a mystery story, and the explanation of whatever is at the core of any mystery story is crucial.I enjoyed this movie a lot, you see--until they got into the explanation of ""why"" this was all happening. After that, the wrap-up went badly.The whole business of a soul trapped in the house because it is traumatized and emotionally unstable was a bad idea. It introduced a lot of baggage and responsibility that was not addressed, ultimately. ""Blowing the house up"" gives you a big pyrotechnic conclusion but it does not free the trapped soul properly. The soul does not go through any sort of ""enlightenment process"" that frees it--which is really what should occur. Instead, it gets ""physically"" freed from the house, which basically avoids the issue.Would have been much better if the house had just been evil. Then, if the house had been a true ""bad guy"" (someone evil/an evil spirit), blowing it up would have made sense.What they used was a very poorly written ending to a film that started very nicely and delivered quite a few good scares! If you're wondering why the story begins to feel ""artificial"" and robotic towards the end, and if you're wondering why you've stopped really caring about the characters, this careless approach to the ending is the reason.Considering that this is a kids' film, too, it is reasonable to say that the message that if you are a traumatized soul, your only escape is for someone to ""blow you up"" in a mercy-killing sort of way is VERY questionable. I'm sure this message was built into the ending by accident. But however it got woven in, I would say it's inappropriate.Monster House is worth a look, and is very well executed in numerous ways. But don't be fooled by the rousing score and the pyrotechnics at the end--the wrap-up is no good!"
127,Monster House,7,10 October 2006,A gem under a misleading trailer,"There seems to be a growing trend to see CGI Animated films that are genuinely good natured, clever and pleasing to watch, which have trailers that make them seem cheap, unoriginal and dumb. So I didn't expect much when I came to see this one, but now that I've seen it I wish the marketing had been a bit more tactful, so more could see this little gem.For a start, the animation itself is amazing. I don't mean glitzy and eye popping (in fact everyone's hair seems to be superglued) but I mean emotionally. I don't think even pixar has been able to tell so much through a single facial expression. When you see someone's face slowly change (I'm thinking of Z in the doorway here) you can almost imagine all the things that are going through their mind and identify with it. The characters are so fleshed out even before they talk! The story is interesting too. The first half is just about perfect for pacing, dramatic tension, identifying characters, humour, you name it. Unfortunately the second half starts dragging a bit and has a bit of a clumsy build up, though Mr. Nevercracker, who seems like a stereotype, reveals a side to himself that makes for an immensely satisfying twist to the story. For a long time there was something that just didn't seem right about the story that I couldn't put my finger on, but I've realised what it was- the film was drastically underpopulated. With only a handful of characters shown, the scale of the film is severely limited, and when...'big bad things' start happening near the end it just doesn't seem as dangerous as it could be, since that sea of suburban houses surrounding the film's locations (of which there are only 3) never seems to have anyone actually living in them.Many animated films seem to fare best as a standalone film, but this one is just begging for an sequel, expanding the film's world as toy story 2 did. There were many examples of real thought put into characters that had a tiny amount of screen time- particularly DJ's parents and the humorous hint of the relationship Chowder's mother has with a 'personal trainer', and to see more of these dynamics would be a real blast.Many people say they don't like to see a movie's evil explained, but the way the kids discover how everything works and use that to their advantage is nicely done. A pity they didn't show more of that room of toys, I'm sure the younger viewers would have liked to be able to stare and imagine swimming through all that themselves. I give this film a 7, for it had great characters, clever humour and a great first half, and a second half that, if not completely satisfying, at least answers all the questions that the first half brought up.A solid effort. Bring on the next suburban adventure for this trio!"
128,Monster House,3,5 October 2006,NOT for kids,"I cannot believe this is a PG film! I took my children to it over the school holidays and they were terrified. The ONLY reason I stayed till the end is if they don't see a happy ending to it, they have nightmares. I was VERY disappointed in it as on the radio they said it was a great film for the holidays.As it was they still had bad dreams about it and I was upset that a PG film has that sort of horror in it.I would not recommend this film to ANYONE under the age of 10, and even then it depends on the child. The big kid (my husband) was the one that suggested we go see it because he saw the trailers and thought it was great. Even he had to admit that it was not a very good movie.The plot was good and the ending was fitting. my boys clapped when it all came to a close. A good way to forget about life for a while."
129,Monster House,7,5 October 2006,One Of Summers Best,"After seeing a series of poor summer movies, Monster House was a breath of fresh air. The children actors do excellent jobs and the adult actors are great. The animation was perfect for this type of film and the story was extremely interesting and even scary at sometimes. This film mixed values with horror, suspense and humor so beautifully that it was a shame when it ended. I have to give a big hand to Steve Buscemi and Mitchel Musso who both gave solid voice over performances. This film definitely has potential for some awards at the end of the year. I hope it's not overlooked by the box office busts that surrounded it. If parents get a chance, take your kids to see this movie. You'll love it as much as they will."
130,Monster House,9,26 September 2006,Great fun for all children from 9 to ~ 99,"First be forewarned ... This film is targeted for children eight or nine and up. There are some truly frightening sequences that may upset children younger than that age. But for just about everyone else this film is one not to be missed! When my daughter wanted to me to take her and her friend to see this movie I begrudgingly agreed, only because it was a rainy day with not much else to do. The most surprising thing about the movie was ... I loved every moment of the movie even more than the kids did! The three central stars are three preteen children (DJ, Chowder and Jenny) and these children sounded just like my own 12 year old yakking about preteen stuff. My hats off to the writers who made these young folks intelligent and real! When they are forced to work together and depend on one another they show themselves to be resourceful, brave and daring, even when frightened out of their wits.The veteran actors and actresses that support these three children are also wonderful in filling out their roles including Steve Buscemi, Maggie Gyllenhall, Kathleen Turner (one of my all time favorite ladies) and John Heder, who voices my favorite supporting character Skull, a very nerdy video game player who the boys look up to because he can play for four days straight on one quarter, a gallon of chocolate milk and an adult diaper!Lastly though ... the house is truly a scary and wonderful. With great CGI work and exceptional special effects the house becomes a spectacularly memorable character in it's own right as it comes to life.I suspect this movies will quickly become a true animated classic and there already is s space on my DVD shelf reserved for it!"
131,Monster House,10,25 September 2006,Excellent,"Just see the reactions of my son and the times he ask me see again the picture, over all, because before I saw, I though will be awful. But a had a big surprise, it is amusing, thrilling and funny. Excellent for kids under 12 (and older than 7). The cast is very good made, the faces are so really My son began to play basketball following the movements of Chowder and his faces. Jenny is excellent, and the nanny. Maybe the only one that is a little stereotyped is Nebbercracker, but the rest are really perfect. Each person that I recommend the picture, are agreed. There was some scenes in the picture that my son had to cover his eyes and ears because he was really scared, but he loved the picture"
132,Monster House,7,18 September 2006,Subversive bit of cinematic fluff,"To a horror lover like myself, ""Monster House"" sounded like a bag of clichés, but it surprised me. Across the street from our hero is an old, spooky house that is, literally, alive. A cranky old man, who looks like Roberts Blossom from ""Deranged"", lives in the house and chases kids away who dare to walk on his precious lawn. The animation, which involves capturing live action, then using the moves to trigger the same in the digital realm, was most recently attempted in ""The Polar Express"", a borefest I roundly criticized not too long ago. Here, the process is very impressive, and the digital reproductions of the human characters are real but slightly skewed to the weird side, which suited me just fine. There is a great back story to the monster house that is presented in a surreal montage. The climax is nothing novel, but the simplicity of the story and limited location (everything takes place within a single suburban block) keep the drama focused. A great treat for kids, and a subversive bit of cinematic fluff for adults."
133,Monster House,6,9 September 2006,A roller-coaster ride to nowhere...,"There have been so many attempts at haunted house movies, that you can't help but feel that if you're watched one you've watched them all. Luckily, Monster House, a creative effort from Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis, is a haunted house movie with enough substance to grant it a watch; if not an entirely satisfactory one at that.Monster House's story revolves around a haunted house whose owner, Nebbercracker, is spied upon by DJ. When Nebbercracker dies, DJ and his friend Chowder believe that the haunted house is truly haunted with Nebbercracker's spirit. When DJ and Chowder later save the life of Jenny, all three attempt to unravel the secrets of the house, but to do so, they must enter inside.The story for Monster House creates a nice notion, goes in a different route, but it's not what you would want from a movie which potentially should be scary to some degree. Granted the target audiences are children, Monster Houses true potential is sadly never realized.The film does sport a unique animation style and while it's obvious that a lot of effort has been put into creating the animation, as seen in the facial features, it ultimately is not entirely attractive. Dreamworks create CG animations which are slicker, and Square has the realism issue in the bag. The animation does indeed work for the time frame used, but it definitely won't be a memorable feature of the movie.What is memorable is the voice acting, with Mitchel Musso (DJ), Sam Lerner (Chowder), and Spencer Locke (Jenny) proving very useful for child actors. They bring great energy to their respective characters, and are humorous at times, but like the lack of creepy moments, there is not enough comedy.In the end, Monster House does not prove scary or funny enough in its venture, but it's not a complete disappointment. Voice acting is superb, and the story is interesting even if unfulfilled. The CG animation is sadly not quite A-grade. This is perhaps Monsters House's problem, besides its voice acting, there is nothing to help elevate it, but it is worth a ride if you have the time."
134,Monster House,7,8 September 2006,Funny and scary- I'm an adult!,"I really enjoyed this movie! It has great characters and dialog, and the story has you hooked the whole way. But, don't be fooled, it has some really frightening scenes.Okay, I'm no horror movie addict so maybe I get scared easily, but there were a few crying kids in the cinema, so think carefully about taking your kids. That said, this movie appealed to the kid in me; two buddies nearing puberty discover a ""monster house"", but when the adults don't believe them they decide to solve the situation themselves- after all, it's Halloween that evening! DJ and Chowder are a hoot, especially when they meet street-smart Julie, and Zee and Mr Nebbercracker are scene stealers. Chowder and the cops provide most of the comic relief, and by then end of a scary ride you discover there is a good story at the heart of it all.This is quite a departure from the line other digitally animated movies have taken and is well worth a look."
135,Monster House,7,6 September 2006,Haunted house premise meets CGI,"The landscape of my youth was dominated by school nights consisting of reading books written by R.L. Stine, Christopher Pike, John Vornholt and the like. While those said writers' mere fabrications of a different set of reality have since begun to sound silly as I grew up (and eventually moved on to movies and occasionally, Stephen King), I can never deny with my overactive imagination how those stories once invoked to me a sense of fear and awe to the world beyond what I thought was real. Such is the case in ""Monster House"", a computer-animated film by newcomer Gil Kenan and backed by two of the most imaginative filmmakers today: Steven Spielberg (""ET"", ""Jurassic Park"") and Robert Zemeckis (""The Polar Express', ""Contact"").DJ (voiced by Mitchel Musso) believes something is wrong with the house across the street. Its owner, the grumpy old Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) is one you don't want to come face-to-face with, and will take anything that lands on his property to never give it back. Kids throughout the neighborhood know enough not to get too close to that house.But all that's about to change when DJ's friend Chowder (Sam Lerner) accidentally bounces his basketball towards Nebbercracker's yard. As DJ tries to get it back, Nebbercracker appears, grabs DJ and tries to scare him away, only to collapse, apparently suffering from a heart attack. Soon, an ambulance arrives and takes Nebbercraker's body away.Ridden by guilt, DJ soon notices that the house is starting to come alive, grabbing and ""eating"" everything that comes near it. With the police dismissing their stories, it's up to DJ, Chowder and an intelligent schoolgirl named Jenny (Spencer Locke) to come up with a plan to stop the house and save the neighborhood before the other kids start trick-or-treating for the Halloween.This story sounds straight from the back cover of an early part of the Goosebumps series and might seem as though there's nothing much special about it. But actually, there's more to it to contribute to the film's novelty. There's no question as to how great Spielberg's imagination is and Zemeckis also has shown a couple of times before how special effects can be employed to aid a good story rather than the other way around (case in point: ""Contact""). Here, with the two acting as executive producers, and Kenan on the directorial chores, they employ the same technique of motion-capture just as it with ""Polar Express"", creating one of the most effective CG-animated movies I've ever seen.As a multimedia arts student who has had a firsthand experience in animation (both hand-drawn and computer-generated) I just can't help but feel amazement over the visuals with its beautifully organic computer animation. The environments both convey the warmth of an autumn afternoon and the coldness of October nights. The characters' motions are, although not flawless, captivating and brilliant. The voice-overs are spot-on. Musso, Lerner, and Locke immaculately breathe personality into their characters.All in all, ""Monster House"" is a fun movie, filled with moments of comedy, horror, suspense, and what a lot of animated movies lack nowadays - a film that can be actually enjoyed by everyone in the audience."
136,Monster House,8,3 September 2006,Fantastic movie,"I went to my local Vue cinema on a weekday to see this just to avoid all the noisy kids.Possilbly the most impressive C.G movie i've seen so far, the use of motion capture makes the characters look almost life like & makes the acting seem more realistic than real people.I love the Robert Zemekis Forrest Gump style opening to the movie as we chase a falling leaf into the oncoming path of a girl on a trike then gets whipped up into the air again & lands on the front porch of 'the house'. The movie has a kind of 80's feel to it, it's like a mish mash of The Burbs, Back to the Future & Nightmmare on Elm Street.Due to the PG rating i was expecting more of a kids film, there were a number of kids in the cinema under the age of 8, some of the scenes i thought were a bit too scary for kids of that age, i did here a few screams followed by crying!! i think a 12 rating would've been more appropriate.A great movie, just don't take young or sensitive children with you!"
137,Monster House,,31 August 2006,"My real ""monster house""","I have not seen the movie yet, but there is a Monster house featurette or companion piece at the end of the movie that will be on the DVD as one of the extras when it comes out. It is on a castle in England, and our house here in the states... our family and our house that is on that documentary! I will check back after the DVD comes out to see what people thought of it. Our home is not evil in any way, but it certainly has a lot of activity in it. The town we live in was originally an old Indian trading post and has over 2000 years of Indian history. This may have something to do with what is on the outside. It is 110 years old and we LOVE it. I can't wait to hear people's comments once it comes out. Please let me know what you think."
138,Monster House,7,31 August 2006,Tim Burton meets The 'burbs,"Remember this 80s Tom Hanks film ""The 'burbs""? What would happen if Tim Burton his version of this neighbourhood story with the help of Hollywood's perfectionists Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis? Well, Monster House would be a likely result. If this film was Stop Motion, everyone would have believed it's another Burton/Selik co-operation. The film is exciting and innovative. The computer techniques are astonishing and you tend to forget that this film is not an old-fashioned animated movie but a new development in film-making. I've always felt that a lot of the recent computer animation films were more a platform for show-offs rather than a determined storytelling business. This is more or less the first time that I really enjoyed such a movie for its story and its looks. Yes, the story is old, and yes, the twists and turns in the story don't bear that many surprises, yet it feels like watching a movie that you have seen a hundred times and still watch every time they show it on TV. Some scenes are quite scary and might be a little too much for really young viewers. However, that makes the movie somehow serious and straight. I liked it very much except for the last 10 minutes or so, when I felt that the story went a little over the top. All in all it's certainly a movie worth watching."
139,Monster House,10,31 August 2006,Wow!,"I am at a loss for words. This film is excellent. So funny and so well made. Rather Burtonesque i would say. Easy to fall in love with ALL the characters! And the line - 'Calm down! You make me wanna throw up in tin foil and eat it!' CLASSIC! A must see for all non-Disney animation fans! It's a PG, a kids movie but equally as enjoyable and hilarious for 'adults'! The graphics are gorgeous. So realistic. I mean just look at those leaves at the beginning. Some of my friends didn't even know it was animated right then! I saw an interview with Gil where he said that he is not sticking to animation only. Well i sure hopes he goes for it again in the near future because this film put a huge grin on my face all the way through! I admit i wasn't even expecting that much from the plot but that shocked me big style. So different. See it. DO IT! Thankyou Gil. You have made my summer!"
140,Monster House,9,31 August 2006,First Aussie to see it... loved it!,"I happened to be on holiday in LA when Monster House was showing, and I thought it would be good to go see it just before I went back home to Australia (the film will be released on 14th September).I loved it. I saw previews for it before I even left for LA, knowing it would be good. I ended up knowing it was awesome! The teaming up of Robert Zemeckies and Steven Spielberg is very unlikely (unless any film buffs know any other Zemeckies/Spielberg projects). The one thing that stood out for me was the animation. There were a couple of times when I thought some of the animation was real! Of course, knowing Robert's other film The Polar Express, that was expected to happen.It is a funny film, some scary moments (not recommended for younger kids, you have been warned), great lines, and brilliant animation. I highly recommend this film for a great family film!"
141,Monster House,9,17 August 2006,The Best Animated Film of 2006,"Dreamworks outdoes Pixar this summer, by offering the best animated feature of the year. Monster House is cool for kids, yet certain to be a hit with grown-ups. It manages to strike a chord with children by inhabiting the world they live in, full of creepy old men living in haunted houses, while at the same time, offering up enough scares and laughs to keep any 30 year old kid at heart thoroughly entertained.The animation is nothing short of inspired, as the motion capture technology truly breathes life into the CGI animation. Facial expressions, ""camera angles"" and ""tracking shots"" are planned with painstaking detail; it's truly a sight to behold. You'll forget you're watching a 'cartoon' right from the fluttering leaf of the opening credits.Not content to stop there, the filmmakers have added to the superb animation with equally superb writing and a cast to deliver those lines. Familiar voices (see the above credits) fill the adult characters with a lot of humour, even though each adult is given only about 5 minutes of screen time. Each actor does a lot with their 5 minutes, completely deserving of their pay check. The clever casting of Jon Heder makes this the first film to get full dynamite for his cameo, as he fits in perfectly as an arcade legend.Still, with all this going for it, Monster House would have failed if its child roles didn't measure up. Fortunately, the three leads steal the show, aptly performing voice work that stretches from childhood tomfoolery to ghastly terror to puppy love, all within the same scene. Their honest approach to the scripts' clever and accurate depiction of children almost too old for trick or treating, yet not quite old enough to forget the bogeyman, makes this a film that will certainly become a perennial Halloween favourite. I know I could watch it a thousand times over.Grade: A"
142,Monster House,10,16 August 2006,good movie 5 stars(i dunno if it is a spoiler or not),before i went 2 see this movie with my mum and younger brother of six my mum was looking at the reviews on the internet to see if it was suitable 4 my bro. the reviews on the internet were claiming that there child of 6 or 7 were terrified. my mum had frightened my bro by telling him them reviews and at first he wouldn't go in the cinema but when the movie started he loved it and he didn't jump or cover his eyes once i was more scared then him! there was also a boy of 4-5 i dunno and his guardian left him alone 2 watch it for 10 minutes and he wasn't scared at all. the claims this movie are 2 scary or not funny are fake! this movie is suitable 4 children of about 5+ very funny and only a tiny winy bit scary! go see this movie! &#9829;&#9787;&#9786;
143,Monster House,8,24 July 2006,You people are idiots... Yes Kids under 10 can/should see this film,"8 Stars out of 10.. It's an awesome movie! See the 3d version!!!!! I really don't have anything to add to the below reviews except.. IT'S NOT TO SCARY FOR KIDS! I read some post that said not to take kids under 10, thats not true. I took my 5 & 6 year olds & they loved. The only thing that scared them was when some of the 3D animation almost hit them in the face, but the plot or action it self is not scary. I've spoken with several other parents with young children that all echoed my opinion. So please people, take your young children of all ages to see this & do so in 3D. We took a 300 mile round trip (nearest 3d showing) to see and it was worth every penny & gallon of gas."
144,Monster House,8,23 July 2006,animation AMAZING,"The computer animation in this is amazing. Almost as good as the 'Final Fantasy' animation and a bit better than 'The Polar Express' animation. Even if you don't like the movies story, just listen to your iPod and watch this film play out. I thought this movie was actually really good but not as hilarious as one may think going in. It's more of the 'realistic to life' kind of humour which does work well. I wouldn't recommend this to kids under 8 because it is a pretty dark film for the most part. There is a lot of similarities to 'Stand By Me' and 'The Goonies' in this as well as a Stephen King prop (look for it). I wish I would have seen this in the Imax because it is definitely something to be seen on a grand scale. I don't think this one will pick up the Oscar for best animated feature but it does deserve a nomination nonetheless. Overall, this is an entertaining film that will not disappoint."
145,Monster House,7,23 July 2006,Excellent  family entertainment !!!,"This is the kind of movie which really makes up for watching movies like ""Lady in the Water"". I really liked the 3D version of the movie.The movie had good humor, and the amount of cuteness for the characters, that you can only generate with cartoons. The story is of this kid and his 2 other friends, who investigate the house opposite as it is haunted. The house only seems to make its move when the adults are not there. So these kids try their best to convince the adults, and try to get help from the police. 2 cops come to check the house, and one of them is a rookie ( very funny ).The movie will hold your attention all the time.Enough said . I recommend you to see the 3D version of this, and you will definitely be entertained."
146,Monster House,8,22 July 2006,Just Doing Its Job,"I've read other readers' comments (votes ranging from 1 to 8) and many voters say, ""Young children this or that..."" Animation originally was never really intended for children. Animation is just another form of film (like horror, romance, black and white, action, etc). Walt Disney wanted to create a full length feature film that was completely animated. Thus, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""The purpose of animation is to create magical moments that can't be captured by a regular camera. Animation is used so the impossible can become possible.Yes, I can understand how some kids can become frightened. Yes, I can understand why some people think the jokes fall flat, but this film was very entertaining. The purpose of film is to entertain us. It's a smart animated piece. I predict that this film and ""Cars"" will be Oscar contenders.One reader said that ""Hoodwinked"" was a superior film. Though I enjoyed ""Hoodwinked"" it is by no means superior, subjectively speaking. Who hasn't had the ""creepy house"" at the edge of our neighborhood, a best friend, or spied on neighbors? ""Monster House"" takes these familiar things and creates a fantasy-like atmosphere. ""Hoodwinked"" takes an existing story and plays/modernizes it. Which would you say is more creative?If the film has entertained you, it's done its job."
147,Monster House,7,22 July 2006,did I see a complete print?,"I don't know if this really has any spoiler but, I am not sure I saw a complete print. After the cops( do jokes about cops and doughnuts ever get old?) have been swallowed and the kids are still locked in the back of the patrol car, it jumped to the house ""relaxing"" and turning back to its usual state, then we see the kids come in the house with their water pistols in hand and they say something like, ""It must think we're still in the car"". Is there a scene missing here? If not, it kind of threw the whole flow not explaining how they got in. Please someone let me know. Thanks. Otherwise, some beautiful shots and great performances and good character looks."
148,Monster House,8,22 July 2006,One Sweet CG House,"Monster HouseCompared to Goonies (1985- Directed by Richard Donner, Written by Steven Spielberg (story) Chris Columbus (screenplay)) in plot, Monster house has a 20% commonality in gene pool as Goonies. Though they would be considered in the same group of films, the plots are completely unrelated. The main character is a pre-teen boy who spies on his crotchety neighbor who terrorizes anyone who sets a foot near, on, or lets something touch his house. Items that hit his lawn quickly disappear, never to be seen again. This is a fairly common story point, but the film opens on the main character getting caught on the ""Monster House""s lawn.This conflict set's off a series of chaotic events. The house itself begins to attack assorted town people and toys on its own. The CGI Monster house model is truly a sight to Behold. The transformation mechanism from old wooden house to demonic wooden monster is incredibly well thought out. The assorted cast is very barebones, but the good pull on the viewer only works with the cast restraints. Borrowing from quite a few spook films, the smashing together of ideas and then displaying them in a compelling manner really works out.The Humanoid Character Design is very picture book like, a connection to a very ""dead Summer"" feeling of the film. It also plays to the lack of/difficulty of use behind complex animation simulations, especially in the case of hair and clothing. Not what you would call true horror, the use of quality cutting, camera angles, and ;lighting effects undermines your conscious mind In the way that a good scary adventure film should. Action and other types of adventure films should take a few ideas from Monster House, because it allows your audience to get energized by the film and yet not scare off anyone that can't handle B movie horror.So, should you spend the money on seeing Monster House in the theatres? I would say yes. The Fact that its available in 3D really builds the need for full screen viewing. Note to those who see it in 3D, Monster House is the second film to be released in REAL D's digital 3D format, and as such, viewing the effects means wearing 3D Glasses. This means a about a 3 dollar surcharge to pay. Also, try to get a good seat, specifically towards the middle of the theater so the glasses work fully. Many of the 3d effects are subtle, emphasizing more then owning the visuals. If there is any part of the film you can ignore the first time you watch the film, it's the very beginning. Though it does set up the characters, the plot doesn't really begin until about a half/quarter of an hour into the film. I give Monster House 8 out of 10. I would say that so far this year, the 3D animation awards are a game between Monster House and the very good and very popular Ice Age. Lets hope I'm both right and wrong."
149,Monster House,7,22 July 2006,interesting...,"Wow...I saw this movie last night, and I was shocked with all of the special effects and graphics! I also was very surprised about how they made the characters emotions and looks very realistic. At some points I became somewhat scared, as my dad fell asleep during it. The first part is when a little girl is riding her tricycle and a leaf follows her. She then comes to befriend this very older looking, haunted looking home. Not trying to let all of the story out, but then an old man comes out of his monster looking house tells the young girl to stay of his property and lawn, and breaks her tricycle, as she runs home in fear...THere are many events that lead up to the main climax with two or three main characters conquering above. This movie is a great choice, and i recommend it for children over maybe seven or eight years of age"
150,Monster House,8,21 July 2006,"While I was watching the movie the man sitting behind me yelled out loud,""I can't believe I am laughing at this!""  This movie is funny.","I enjoyed watching this movie, the characters were well developed and the story line was entertaining. I fully enjoyed watching the progrestion of the ""Monster House"", and I enjoyed the ending. I was distracted by the younger children when they asked their parents if they could sit on their laps. Following the question would be the reassuring comment that they were not scared. I know this movie was not scary but I was surprised at some of the scenes and would cation a parent with young children. If you child still thinks Aladan is scary then I would not take them to this move. If your children are like my younger brothers ,however, I would encourage you to take them out and have fun watching the movie, I know I did."
151,Monster House,7,15 July 2006,Better than expected!,"Caught an early screening and was surprised that the movie was pretty good.I think however releasing this movie in the summer is kind of strange considering it takes place around Halloween and maybe better suited at that time.The lighting, and texturing detail was amazing...The image quality overall was very nice. I really enjoyed the cinematography and it was very well edited.I will say that I HATED the animation of the chars... Sorry not fans of MOCAP...The characters still seem way to stiff...On the up side the house moved great! The animators did a great job with that! Not to sure how much I like the character design...And the fact that nobody had any hair...It was all modeled...not sure if it was a look choice or a money choice...but I think I would have been nice to see that detail.Overall a good movieI would not bring anyone younger than 10 years old to see it...I think little kids may be too scared..."
152,Monster House,10,11 July 2006,A great movie for 8 and over,"The movie of Monster House is a great movie,in my opinion.However, I do not think younger kids will enjoy the movie.I think that due to some scary scenes which may scare them.It also includes a little brief language. Older kids may find cool and interesting.It would not be scary to them, though.I also really enjoyed that we can watch "" Monster House"" in 3D.Overall,I truly enjoyed watching the movie. I do agree with the rating being PG ( Parental Guidance Suggested). It will probably to continue to do good all over Canada. I think the studio which is Columbia Pictures should make a sequel.Again, kids aged 8 and over will probably be interested in the movie.MONSTER HOUSE IS GREAT!!!!I really liked this movie!"
153,Monster House,,28 February 2012,"Perhaps the house ate the script, too.","Fat people just can't get a break in recent big-screen cartoons. But this was just warm-up for the trashing they'd get in a certain cute-Armageddon-robot feature. The obese woman is a circus side-show and then becomes a monster house - no less (coz they're as big as a house, see, the over-sized tards). Meanwhile, the red-head girl picks the skinny boy over the chubby one with the big fat basketball-friendly round head. The message of the movie is clear: fatties, go on a diet, or you might become abandoned evil houses and women/men won't date you.Not that the monster-house woman is that much more obese than the average American today. Perhaps in 300 years MH will be regarded as a strange curiosity, with its uniformly obese audiences wondering why the ""odd skinny husband"" wasn't the circus's main attraction and why the chubby kid didn't get the girl. I am of course referring to the kind of future suggested in ""WALL-E"".There is definitely something about fatties that makes computer animators enjoy doing them (I mean animating them, not THAT). They just fill up the screen hence no need to work on filling up the remaining space, because there is none. Perhaps that's why.MH doesn't have a great story, much less an attention-grabbing finale, and it holds little interest for adults. Even worse, MH also shares the same disease as all the feature-length animations in the past decade or so, in that the voices are totally normal and are mostly provided by big-name actors instead of by unknown voice specialists, i.e. professionals who'd lend some much-needed quality in that department  if given half a chance. The annoying thing is that Hollywood stars aren't hired for these cartoons because they're ideal for their roles  which couldn't be further from the truth - but for purely marketing reasons. Dollars at the expense of quality: nice.One of the reasons why old-time cartoons such as Bugs Bunny or old Disney features are superior to nearly all of the big-screen animated drivel made today is precisely that: pros doing great voices. Hearing Tom Hanks's voice in a regular movie is bad enough, but hearing it sound EXACTLY the same in a cartoon is even worse. No Hanks here, to be clear, but even though I like Buscemi I don't want to hear his voice  or any ""normal"" voice - in a cartoon. Is that a strange request? Apparently, it is, in this age of poor taste and diminishing quality. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal, a talent-free nepotist, does one of the voices in MH: that says it all."
154,Monster House,1,29 October 2006,Think twice before taking your kids to see this one.,"Think twice before taking your kids to see this one. In the first 10 minutes, the main character (a kid) has his neighbor die right on top of him (slumping on his body). As if this weren't enough, there are then plenty of nice long shots of the dead man's eerie face smeared up against the screen, and other dramatic touches like a long close-up of his dead hand dragging on the ground, or the paramedics dragging the dead body away, uncovered. Then, when the kid seeks out his baby-sitter to talk about it (his parents being absent), she won't listen to him but is instead annoyed he's trying to talk to her so intentionally shows him who's ""in control"" by breaking a pot and blaming him for it. No one can be trusted! Save your money and go see something more worth your while."
155,Monster House,3,20 August 2006,"Stunning animation, tedious and disjointed story","As with many CGI animated features the quality of the production is faultless in terms of technical achievement. However after sitting through an extremely long introduction to the central characters in this story, and some tedious and pointless meanderings into non-central characters, the kids finally enter the house, which lets face it, is all viewers really want to find out about. But unfortunately in an attempt to build tension and curiosity about what the deal is with the creepy house, all interest has, by the time they enter the house, dissolved away, leaving only the incessant whining of the kids voices, which start to grate very early on, and a desire for them to exit the house, so you can exit the movie theatre and go home. A real shame the whole story is built on such a shaky foundation when you do finally learn the truth behind the house too. Unlike Cars - a vastly superior movie in terms of its full and satisfying storyline, this was an overall visually impressive but very weak film with very few laughs indeed."
156,Monster House,10,15 November 2014,My Favorite Computer Animated Movie,"I saw this movie in the movie theaters 8 years ago on a date. I've rented it and seen it a couple of times since then. But, of all the computer animated movies, I'd rank this one as my favorite for a few reasons. One, is if I see movies like Cars or Finding Nemo, they seem too kiddish for me and they always have, even though they made a lot of money and have good special effects. I mean those movies seem like watching a TV show for preschool aged kids and I don't think of the plots as that entertaining. I feel like watching Cars where all the characters are vehicles, is like watching Thomas The Tank Engine. I think I prefer movies with human characters. Well, I can give you a few reasons this movie really entertained me and why I prefer it over any other computer animated movie so far. Obviously, the characters in this movie are humans, and this movie takes place in the modern day rather than how some of these computer animated movies take place like during the medieval period. Not only does it take place in the modern day but if you watch the movie you'll notice how it doesn't take place during the time it was made in the 2000s, and supposedly takes place in the '80s, a period of time a lot of us can consider when life was more simple. What else is also interesting about this movie, the main characters in this movie are middle school students: DJ, Chowder, and Jenny. I think of middle school as the most interesting age. The characters in this movie, seem like realistic characters and they're computer animated. The neighborhood where the action takes place also seems like a typical neighborhood, minus the creepy house across the street from DJ. It's also cool how Jon Heder the guy who we remember as Napoleon Dynamite plays a voice in this movie as like an alienated obsessed video game player, knowing how things from video games can apply to real life. The movie shows some scary images too, like skeletons. The house across the street, by all means is a scary house and some of the action scenes in the movie reminded me of a couple of action scenes in a bigger movie, War Of The Worlds. This movie did get pretty intense and scary in a couple of scenes where it almost felt like it should have been rated PG-13. This is also like a Halloween movie, as the action takes place the day before and the day of Halloween. Too bad this movie didn't make as much money as a lot of the other computer animated movies. But, to me personally this movie meets more of my taste, and it seems like a more entertaining and less cheesy movie to watch than a lot of those other computer animated movies. I'd give this movie a 10/10."
157,Monster House,9,25 September 2014,Monster House deserves better,"DJ is a preteen boy, confused about growing up, meeting girls, and being ""normal"". His best friend is an immature and overweight boy donning a cape, Chowder, and DJ's hobby is spying on Old Man Nebbercracker, a bony old crone who seems to hate children. When the old guy drops dead while attacking DJ, the two boys find themselves caught up in the mystery of the house the old man lived in, possessed by the spirit of a morbidly obese woman named Constance.What was honestly very surprising in a movie like this, was the strangely delivered message about what kind of rage possesses a bullied individual. Constance was living in a circus during the Vietnam War, as ""Constance the Giantess"". Crowds of people would throw tomatoes and food at her and call her names, until Nebbercracker, in his Twenties then, rescues her and marries her. While building their dream home, a gang of young kids pelt eggs at Constance, and she remembers the circus and ends up killing herself in a fit of rage. Had everyone been nicer to her, perhaps she would have lived and wouldn't be the angry ghost that lives within this film.With the various fart jokes and lines such as ""she grabbed my butt"", you wouldn't think this would be a good movie for kids. It certainly isn't for little kids, I'd say maybe ages 12 and up, but it does surprisingly have some good lessons in it, such as respect towards the elderly, and not to judge people by their appearance. Aside from that, this movie was HILARIOUS! I loved it! I loved the soundtrack, the plot, the characters... my only complaint are the crude humor jokes. There is one scene where the two boys have stayed up all night and haven't left to go pee, therefore they have Mountain Dew bottles piled high full of pee on DJ's dresser. There is some humor only adults would get. Nevertheless, this has been one of my favorite movies ever since it first came out."
158,Monster House,8,31 July 2013,Pretty scary for a PG film,"If there's one thing that's difficult to do in the horror genre, it's to make a scary PG film. Yet, the one that takes place here accomplishes that beautifully. The question is, what elements are the actually key components that help make it so effective - of course that will be covered. For a viewer though, it's just amazing how undeniably interesting the story is to this film. There are a couple of things that I feel needed to be brought up because it doesn't fit but on the whole, it makes up for some good creepy scares.Written by Dan Harmon, Rob Schrab and even Pamela Pettler, screenwriter of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005) & 9 (2009) (for good measure I'm sure) found a way to make this story really stand out on its own. The plot revolves around how a group of ordinary kids figure out that a house in the neighborhood is living on its own, literally. And it's no friendly house either, no, no, no, no. This house is by far from being homey, inside and out. What makes the story even more intriguing is how the owner of the house is just as scary looking as the house itself.The voice acting to the film was done proficiently as well. All the voices matched their characters respectively. The character most viewers will enjoy is Chowder and his ability to be so fickle in his decisions and his kid-like playfulness. However, the character I found the most likable was Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi). Buscemi's ability to make Nebbercracker be so crotchety and soft at different times is remarkable. It's like he was playing a totally different character. Surprisingly though, this is where I found a flaw - character design & charm.I'm not saying the animation was done badly. By no means - the animation is done well for Sony's first animated feature. It's weird too, because the characters do look computer generated, yet they have this clayish texture to them, a claymation picture like Gumby: The Movie (1995). Back to character design and charm. I'm not sure if it's because the plot revolved around kids but none of these child characters grew on me. To me, they just don't make a very memorable group and unfortunately I can't explain why. It's expected though that many people will enjoy Chowder's performance though, he was the comedy relief of the film, no doubt.But, if there's one thing that'll make viewers skin crawl, it'll be the imagery and musical score provided by Douglas Pipes. Again, for a PG film, this is fairly dark. Not only is the Buscemi's character, Nebbercracker, freakishly thin, but so is the external and internal look of his house. If rickety old wood and dirty windows make you cringe, this house will creep you out. Even various characters will be eaten alive (which is in the trailer so that's no spoiler)! I do question what happens to them though, that's never explained....at all.Let's not forget Mr. Pipes' music. This is what really makes this a creepy movie. Pipes not only has a main theme but he also has motif themes for Mr. Nebbercracker and his house. It's basically a light tread on the piano keys and a wipe of the harp strings, but boy oh boy does it create the chills. Not only that, but it also gives the character some real feeling because it shows what kind of person that he is. I will admit, it is not effective all the time for example in an action scene, but it still makes itself known throughout the movie which is important. If you want something new to see, this is a film for that.Its characters may not be the most memorable, but its covered by some creepy music, unique animation and good voice-acting."
159,Monster House,7,9 December 2012,Scary family fun,"I've watched this with our kids quite a few times over the years, and it's still great fun. This film reminds me a lot of 80's movies which put kids centre-stage of a mystery, including E.T. and The Goonies. The animation is pretty good, the voices excellent, and the plot better than many an animated family movie. This film got a lot of criticism for being too scary for the little ones, and there may be some truth in that as our kids talked about 'the man who took that little girl's bike' for a long time, but really this is suitable for all ages so long as they've a grown-up with them to hide behind if it gets to be too much!If you're looking for Halloween haunted house frights for all the family, look no further."
160,Monster House,10,14 June 2012,Like a perfect starter for a Halloween night movie marathon,"I watched MONSTER HOUSE back when it was brand new; watched it on the big screen, certainly. Six years later I still had the memory that it was a really nice movie and that I quite enjoyed it. Recently I had the chance to get the Blu-Ray for a great price on Ebay. I wasn't really looking for it but now I'm glad I got it as I really liked it. First thing that gained my attention during this second viewing was the animation. I mean, this ain't an old movie (only six years has passed since its release) but CGI moves fast and certainly now you can see the differences between its animation and the one from a movie like TOY STORY 3 (from 2010). But anyway, it's definitely a fine piece of work and to be fair, after some minutes into it I was doing nothing more than just enjoying it. I see this as a perfect starter for a Halloween night movie marathon (it is actually set in the hours previous Halloween night). I mean, of course this should not be the main attraction of the night (leave that to something like HELLRAISER!) and of course your pals may laugh with your choice, but if they know how to appreciate stuff like a very nice atmosphere (that sort of echoes Hitchcock's classic REAR WINDOW) and a love story with a great creepy touch they will surely like this ""kids movie"". It's also quite funny and, undeservedly, a bit overlooked too. Highly recommended! *Watched it (again) on 03 June, 2012"
161,Monster House,8,3 February 2011,This Halloween adventure proves to be quite an adrenaline rush!,"It's been a few years since this particular computer animated film came into theatres, but it was only very recently brought to my attention. I watched ""Surf's Up"" and ""Open Season"" late last year and saw that like those two CGI films, Sony Pictures was involved in the production of this one. I found ""Surf's Up"" to be very good and ""Open Season"" to be a mixed blessing, and knowing ""Monster House"" was reasonably popular, but didn't seem to be generally thought of as one of the CGI masterpieces, I thought maybe this one would come somewhere in between the other two Sony Pictures productions I've mentioned. This 2006 animated horror comedy may not have turned out to be what I imagined when I rented it, but it did turn out to be better than I expected, and not like any other computer animated movie I've ever seen! D.J. Walters is a preteen boy who lives directly across the street from a rundown house where a strange old man named Mr. Nebbercracker lives. Whenever a kid's belonging lands on this man's lawn and the kid tries to get it back, Nebbercracker scares the young trespasser away and takes the item inside! One day, when D.J.'s best friend, Chowder is visiting, his basketball lands on Nebbercracker's lawn, and D.J. bravely tries to get it back for him! While doing so, he is caught by his mysterious neighbour, and during a confrontation, the old man collapses and is taken away in an ambulance. D.J. and Chowder think Nebbercracker is now dead. That night, D.J. hears his teenage babysitter, Zee's boyfriend, Bones talking to her about his scary experience with the house across the street, so the preteen sneaks out and meets his friend to investigate Nebbercracker's house. During this investigation, Chowder is almost eaten by the rundown house, so it's clear that this house is a monster! The next day is Halloween, and after D.J. and Chowder rescue a girl named Jenny from the monster house when she goes there to try and sell chocolates for her school, the three of them must somehow stop this house before the kids in the neighbourhood go trick-or-treating tonight! With a little girl being scared away by Nebbercracker and losing her tricycle near the beginning, the story is already intense, and pretty much remains that way for the rest of the film! The characters generally aren't the most captivating ones in the history of CGI animated features, including Zee and Bones. It isn't always that funny watching these two bully D.J., but at least this doesn't last long, and there certainly could be worse characters here. There are frequent funny moments here that made me laugh, with certain bits of dialogue and such, but with all the tension, the humour basically seems like a bonus! There's a huge amount of adrenaline-pumping suspense in the story, and viewers will likely find that they're in for some surprises as they wonder where this unforgettably scary story is going to go next! The protagonists never travel very far at all on their frightening adventure, but that certainly doesn't make it any less entertaining! The cast as a whole do a good job, and I learned from the DVD bonus features that they provided more than just the voice-overs with the way this movie was animated. The high quality of the animation obviously helps the film as well.This movie isn't like any other CGI animated piece I've ever seen, as I've never seen any other this spooky! One can always expect humour in these computer animated family movies, and ""Monster House"" has some of that, but to me, it really seems that it's more about the scares than the laughs, which is unusual for this type of film! However, that certainly doesn't mean this is a bad piece of animation, as I have to praise it for its tension and unpredictability. The only reasons why I'm giving this movie an eight out of ten instead of a nine are perhaps that it's not as pleasant as one would expect CGI family films to be, and maybe some parts didn't seem quite right to me in a movie like this. Still, overall, ""Monster House"" is a very well done and memorable effort, and I think it's a great choice for computer animation fans who are looking for something significantly different! There clearly has been debate over whether kids should watch it or not, and there's no denying that it is scary, so parents just might want to be cautious, but I'm sure many kids have enjoyed it over the past few years (maybe mostly older ones, though I can't be 100% sure). Like most animated family flicks I've seen, I really don't think this one is strictly for any specific age group."
162,Monster House,8,16 February 2010,Succeeds on all levels,"This understated and under-hyped CGI animated movie is a ghost/horror story for kids, a job which it performs very well, being suggestively (rather than actually) scary.At the heart of it is the relationship between two boys and, subsequently, the admission of a girl into the relationship. Because these characters are so well conceived and written, there is bags of audience identification and, after a slowish start, the story fairly whips along as our gang of three fail to convince authority that something weird is going on.The story itself is functional rather than original, and the character design and animation are deliberately stylised and, perhaps, not as lush as we have come to expect.But these are minor quibbles in a film which, above everything else, is well written, with vocal performances which do it justice."
163,Monster House,6,14 November 2006,"An entertaining story done in a boring fashion, Monster House will keep the kids busy, but will bore everyone else","With a plethora of computer-animated films coming out this year, it's surprising to see one that can actually stand out from the rest of the bunch. It's both a good thing and also a bad thing. Monster House is a clever idea done in a not-so-clever manner. While the script and story is very entertaining, the writers and director fails to make this a top-notch Halloween film. But, where the humor and sentimentality fails miserably, its almost made up by the suspense and horror of the house itself. The main characters are all bland and not entertaining in the least bit, the main feature in the film, the main source of entertainment, is the monster house itself. Like Nacho Libre and most of the PG films of 2006, there isn't much of a mix of content for kids and adults, this is mostly and remains a kids movie, despite the heavy adult material throughout the first half of the movie.Every neighborhood has at least one disgruntled neighbor that seems to have something shoved up his-anyway; you know those kinds of people. Well, in Monster House, that neighbor happens to be Nebbercracker, which takes all the toys that enters his front lawn. His bitterness isn't explained, nor is it ever questioned, its just accepted in hostile manner. When DJ, the main character of this tale, accidentally sends him into the hospital, the house suddenly emerges alive and starts taking victims by luring them in different ways. DJ, his best friend Chowder, and a newcomer Jenny embark on a mission to stop the house from taking people before Halloween night rolls in and a potential bloodbath starts.Besides Cars, this is the best-looking animated movie of the year. Animation aside, this is one of the worst animated movies in terms of humor. There is very little to laugh about in this film. The voicework wasn't exactly up to par, with the exception of veterans Kevin James and Catherine O'Hara, the jokes were usually flat, the puberty joke was done way too many times, and the clown of the movie, Chowder, just didn't deliver as many funny one-liners as one would hope, and his crude humor will only interest the most immature of children. With lack of humor, lack of pop culture references, the adults got nothing. As for the kids, if they love creepy stuff, this is for them, as the house delivers plenty of thrills. In the third act of the movie, it picks up, but just as it picks up, the bad jokes continue flying, and then the ending just falls flat.Bottom Line: While this review was written mostly with a negative tone, it's still a decent film, as long as you don't expect humor. Its suspense, drama, and surprises run the film while the cast of characters fails to amuse. Kind of like how the NASA trousers ran the classic Wallace and Gromit cartoon ""The Wrong Trousers,"" the monster house is the main focus of the picture, and the reason why it will keep you at the edge of your seat, especially when the showdown against the house actually occurs. But, take away the house, and you have yourself bland characters in a bland environment with stereotypical situations. Monster House: just let the kids watch this."
164,Monster House,5,29 October 2006,Not what expected,"I actually thought the movie was better than the rating of 5 that I gave it. However, it was not what I expected. Yes I know it has a PG rating, but I expected something that was lighter. My 8 year old daughter was a bit unnerved by it. So if you go into this with the understanding that it's ""dark"" then the story is really good. There are some moments at the start where as a parent I didn't like the interaction between the characters. If you've seen the TV show Fairly Odd-Parents on Nick it's some of that type of interaction. Also, there are some mild sexual comments between a baby sitter and her boyfriend. I was OK??? with my 10 year old but really didn't like the 8 year old listening into that type of conversation and the situation that was presented. Don't get me wrong it's nothing extreme but was just unexpected."
165,Monster House,4,23 October 2006,A Respectable Mismatch..,"A mystery/thriller core under the cover of animation with some crude humor feels so weird, and uncomfortable to watch.. Plus, this movie deserves a way better score to help create the atmosphere. And the plot, or the way they develop it, is bad.. well maybe it's because I'm too old for this, I feel no suspense at all throughout Monster House. (BTW, I'm 20) The way they get the idea about 'the source of life' from the video game king is ridiculously corny. Bored is a strong word, but I was verging on it by the end.However, though personally I didn't enjoy it, I'd quite like to show my adoration to the animation crew- the '3D motion capture techniques' are awesome~"
166,Monster House,3,3 October 2006,Inappropriate for small children and adults; perhaps 10-year olds will like it.,"I went to this movie with small children, expecting it to be at their level. It definitely was not. I found it far too scary for small children, and not interesting enough for me. I left the theatre wondering just what audience the creators of this mess thought they were hoping to reach. That it was in 3-D was a novelty, but it only exacerbated the misfit between film and audience.On the positive side, the movie was technically well done and the voices fit the characters very nicely. These strengths do not make up for the inappropriateness of the story. This movie continues the trend of using cutesy animation designed to attract small children to utterly inappropriate material.I should add that I took other small children (large family) to see ""Jurassic Park"" when it came out, and was admonished that it was inappropriate. I didn't think so, and still don't. Somehow, I am more put off by cutesy animation than by live actors with special effects, although I recognize that 3- and 4-year olds probably don't make such distinctions."
167,Monster House,9,5 September 2006,One of the best animated movies I've seen in years.,"After seeing the trailer for Monster House, I thought it would just be another clichéd movie for kids. But after seeing it in the cinema, I was definitely proved wrong. Gil Kenan gives the movie an enticing malevolent charm and keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, wondering what is going to happen next. The animation is superb and, occasionally, looks extremely realistic. I am a teenager and, I must admit, this film made me jump several times after being so enthralled in its dark and menacing atmosphere. The plot of Monster House is incredibly imaginative and contains some marvellously written issues of friendship and true love what adults can relate to. I recommend this film to anyone above the age of 8, as children younger than that may find it too scary. Adults will enjoy this film as it has a few jokes what younger children may not understand, but had me laughing out loud. A brilliant movie all-round and one that can't be missed!"
168,Monster House,5,30 August 2006,Awwww. ....C'mon........,"Now that's what I call disappointing. I really expected more .... and sure not (well, not only) because it's a Spielberg / Zemeckis -movie, which ,-I admit it-, sounded quite promising. It was much more because of all the other animation - stuff in cinema year after year, that followed the Pixar breakthrough. I must say, I expected this movie to be something NEW. A whole new animation universe, less bubblegum, more density and thrill. Well, I was wrong. And I guess a lot of people know, how I felt after watching MonsterHouse. Actually, I'd say there is enough good things to be said about it. Character interaction, for instance, is very well worked out. The House itself is an amazing piece of animation. But in the end, these are some fine details, that still don't make a good movie. Even from the view of a kid,( which I don't claim to be able to represent here), the movie will probably be a disappointment as not only the few jokes but also the story is flat. I mean, the idea itself is good, but again, while watching the movie, the pieces just don't seem to fit together. In the end, I'd say, there's at least half an hour missing. 30 minutes, that could have made a difference between a capturing and amazing story we might have got, and this masterpiece of fast- food- animation we got here. Very well done, that's why I give it a 5 (and not a 3), but definitely not well enough to be entertaining. Or Innovative.This movie is not for adults. This movie is not for kids. I'd say it's a movie for two guys (Spielberg / Zemeckis) trying to be kids. Nice try , after all."
169,Monster House,6,15 August 2006,don't bother. there are better films than this,"i was highly anticipating the release of Monster House as it was critically acclaimed. upon viewing however i saw a different story unfold before my eyes, the beginning saw me looking forward to a funny and cleverly articulated adventure focusing around children however all i got was kids going puberty and suffering from parents who don't listen and a horny babysitter who only wants sex sex sex! the house itself is a bit of a mystery and i admit i was curious as to why it was like it was, but it wasn't enough to save this dire film from the extinction to which it fell. i admit there were some very funny one liners but that was the only satisfaction i got from the film. it was lines like ""a kissed a girl...i kissed a girl on the lips"" and ""She touched my bum"" that made me laugh (some what politely) The only addition to the entertainment was in the form of the black cop who was both witty and fun to watch.The house itself was lacking certain vital elements which coincidentally resulted in the downfall of this motion picture. As for the reason for the house being the way it is i felt it was very poor."
170,Monster House,8,7 August 2006,OMG: Telekenetic Claymation,"One gets tired of seeing CGI animation these days. This movie didn't look like CGI. It looked like reclamation. Claymation done by people who can bend matter with their minds. The effect was quite arresting - like seeing small dolls actually talking and moving around. The use of focus, such as nearby blades of grass being out of focus, heightened the reclamation effect. I was on my seat just from the visual impact.Then there was the characterization and script - which contributed charm and giggles, and would have made a quite effective live-action film.The tone of the film was somewhere between ""Stand By Me"" and ""The Goonies"". Some of the humor was a bit dark or adult for younger kids. The one black character was a bit stereotyped - dopey, simple-minded, impulsive. And the ""monster"" of the film was also a stereotype right out of ""South Park"" - a voracious sub-verbal obese woman. When her spirit is finally liberated from earthly existence (first as a sub-verbal obese woman and after that as a monster house), the man who loved her before he became her captive is visibly relieved. Somewhat iffy and unwholesome. Both of these characterizations were not necessary and detracted from the quality somewhat. Ahh. I see that the writers Dan Harmon & Rob Schrab have recently worked on a project for Sarah Silverman. Sigh. Well then it's to be expected that you're going to get a combination of laugh-out-loud and messed-up stereotyping. But man, those visuals were so arresting. I'm still considering the 2+ hour journey next weekend out to the nearest theater which is showing it in 3d. ""Chicken Little"" was a huge waste of 3d which this show definitely won't be.PS. Just saw the 3d version. Quite amazing. Nice 3d preview as well."
171,Monster House,2,7 August 2006,We walked out,"We brought our seven year old and walked out. This was not a child's film. But it was marketed that way. We have written a letter to Regal Cinema demanding our money back. What is the studio thinking? Who ever green lighted the marketing campaign for this should be fired. We sent emails to our friends warning them about this so they didn't have to put their little ones through this, but it was too late. What we found out was they too walked out. This would be a good film for 13 on up but not children. I will think twice now when I bring my family to see a family film by Zemekis or what ever his name is. So what it is worth, do not bring your little child to this movie unless you have enough money for your family therapist."
172,Monster House,3,3 August 2006,Monster House,"Great animation, and spooky for little kids. Not much more to say about this movie.The voices are well chosen, making emotion be heard when it was needed to be, and sounding right just like a kids voice.There wasn't very much comedy in this movie. But when there was supposed to be it wasn't really funny, maybe a little ""humph"" but nothing more. Maybe it would be funnier to the 5-9 year olds.The animation was really good though. Everything looked beautiful and spooky at the times when it was supposed to. It would be spooky enough to scare 3-7 year olds. But it shows how good they can make a movie.Overall this movie was okay. Nothing I would watch again, and I'm not extremely happy I watched it, but I did and oh well."
173,Monster House,8,30 July 2006,"The only thing from which kids needs protection is overprotective parents,","My friend and I saw Monster House today, the only college-age folks amidst a theatre full of overweight parents in khaki shorts and fanny packs with their, surprisingly well-behaved, children. All in all it was quite an enjoyable little movie, simple and visually active enough for young ones, but not insulting to the intelligence of older viewers. Was it a little scary? Yes, as it should be. When did it become the case that a child would be hopelessly traumatised by anything slightly frightening, or (God forbid) someone drinking beer or kissing? If such is indicative of contemporary parenting conventions, I dread the generation of massively overprotected, socially-inept adults who will one day be paying into my social security (if such a thing lasts another two years of Republican rule)."
174,Monster House,5,29 July 2006,"scary, predictable plot/ 3-D animation","Digital animation is so common that there is no point to comment on it. The 3-D looks like all the other 3-D films.The film plot is very linear, very one-dimensional. I wish they would have done more character development for the main kid. He was in danger during the movie but I didn't feel the need to care about him.I like that some of shots in the movie were homage to old horror movies.There are some intense scary scenes, something I would not take the little kids to see.It's an okay movie. The main attraction was the voice talent: Steve Buscemi, Jason Lee, Jon Heder, etc...I hope Jon Heder does more animation movies. If they spent some more time on the script, I think it would be a better movie. It's good, not great."
175,Monster House,4,25 July 2006,Missing the adult appeal methinks,"The previews, and the tendencies of current feature length animated movies, led me to believe this would be a humorous thriller. I was disappointed therefore, that the amount of humor was fairly small. I believe this movie might be a thriller for children, but there is nothing there to excite the heart of an adult. I found the character of the babysitter especially repugnant for an animated children's feature. I feel that sort of despicable character belonged in a movie for teenagers, not for younger children. The animation is first rate, but it is not ""fun"" to look at, like Toy Story or Shrek.So no story for this adult, not much humor, and unexciting animation sums up why I give this movie a four out of ten."
176,Monster House,5,25 July 2006,About What I Expected,"I should of known better. In the first place I don't care for the animated movies, but when there are none others, or I've seen all the other ones playing I will take one in. I only rated it a ""5"", cause I thought it was very corny and lame. Everything is predictable and some of the scenes were getting so loud I couldn't ever take a nap. It was 114 out today so I thought I would take a chance on it. Two of us went and with popcorn and two drinks it was only $21.50 for the matinée. I came home and researched it some thinking that I should have recognized some of the voices. The only one I knew was Kathleen Turner and we had got up and walked out before her voice came into play. It is good entertainment for children and I don't intend to take that away from it. Like I said, not my cup of tea, and I should have known better..."
177,Monster House,9,25 July 2006,A great and very entertaining film with just a few flaws...,"Monster House/2006/***1/2Main Stars: Mitchel Musso Sam Lerner Spencer Locke Steve BuscemiTwenty-nine year old Gil Kenan's Monster House is a pure delight but rather short. It was around an hour and twenty-seven minutes. If that's not specific, I don't know what is. The title practically explains the entire plot and that was what was intended. But PG (to me) is not the correct rating. I would actually rate it PG-13 for not only scary images and sequences but a little raunchiness. I expected the scary sequences and cheap loud moments but what I didn't expect was the writing to be a bit over the top for children around eight or nine and up (I suppose that's the age for PG). I would say twelve is the youngest age to see this movie but that's just me. For example: A Gothic and indifferent (except for practically herself and music) babysitter named ""Zee"" or Elizabeth (she would prefer ""Zee"") (played by Maggie Gyllenhaal) going to baby-sit DJ (one main character played by Mitchel Musso) and staying in the house and listening to hard metal rock. Her boyfriend Bones (Jason Lee) is somewhat raunchy in his own way. Kind of ""punky"" actually There are other crude humor scenes but I definitely enjoyed the film anyway. And so far I've shown very positive criticism for every movie of 2006 except for The Benchwarmers. Speaking of that, Jon Heder (actor from The Benchwarmers and actor that played Napoleon Dynamite in Napoleon Dynamite) makes another performance as the somewhat paranoid techno geek Reginald ""Skull"" Skulinski who gives the main characters a little advice on how to defeat the MONSTER HOUSE!! The main characters- DJ, his dorky and porky friend Chowder (Sam Lerner), and a little girl they meet across the street selling Halloween candy named Jenny (Spencer Locke)- are the ones who need the advice. The house's creepy owner, Nebbercraker (Steve Buscemi), is the crotchety old man that forbids everyone to even set a toe on his lawn or, in the movie's case, a basketball or tricycle or beer bottle, etc. But why does he forbid? It's secret unless you've seen it already but it's pretty obvious if you ask me. Once the gang of three sees a few people either being eaten or thrown around, they have enough evidence to step into action. They need to destroy it before it causes any more damage to the neighborhood which doesn't even pay the slightest bit of attention to the house's growling or slinging people around. No one takes any notice except for the people actually getting eaten and thrown around which was just a bit far-fetched or completely ludicrous. But I only somewhat cared. I was having too much fun watching the excellent and exaggerated animation and cinematography (perfect) and, of course the most interesting part, the story. The kids need to convince the cops or anyone that wouldn't believe a word they said that the house is really haunted and really is ALIVE! How can you kill something living that's an animal and not a plant or anything else? Same results practically apply. It is a clever film executive produced by none other than Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis and directed by a no-name young man named Gil Kenan who just graduated from film school before he directed this instant hit. I'm sure Kenan will be a name director after getting loads of money hauled in for this movie which (as of right now while I'm typing) is the second top movie in the box office (behind Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest) making a whopping (in millions) $23.0 (remember as of right now while I'm typing. Results may vary over time and they most likely will). $23.0 million isn't as huge as I would have suspected it to be. I thought it would be more in the $80 million range. But they will make more money after a few more months in the theaters and when it comes out on DVD. As I said before, this movie is an instant hit and I hope many people realize it as I do. However, it was not excellent because it was too short and there was the fact that no one would even hear the house growling and throwing people around and of course EATING them! Well maybe just swallowing them. But still a great, entertaining film indeed! Movie directed by Gil Kenan."
178,Monster House,9,23 July 2006,Something wicked lives across the street.,"A good blend of scares and funny one liners. May I suggest to parents, this movie is not for kids under 10, cause kids around 11 or 12, may under its type of scariness. It really brings out the 12 year old in all of us, has we all used to have fears about haunted houses, not to mention nightmares. The evolves around DJ and Chowder to 12 year old boys, discover that a certain house across the street is a living breathing monster, it hurts anybody that comes in its path. After they rescue a girl scout named Jenny, they all discover that they have to venture in the house,to put an end to the evil, but will they succeed if the house doesn't put an end to them first. This movie had great animation since The Incredible(2004). It was quite an enjoyable ride."
179,Monster House,2,27 June 2006,The movie was a monster to watch!!!!,"Horrible, never-ending and boring. The only redeeming part of this film was when it ended and we could leave the theater. Also, inappropriate for children containing abuse of alcohol, stealing drugs from a pharmacy, cop killing, making fun of obese women and much much more! The kids in the audience liked it, but we couldn't wait for it to end! Save your money, this is not worth seeing. We've come to expect much better from Dreamworks and Spielberg. The animation was crude, the storyline dull and predicable and the content was not appropriate for children (to whom this film is aimed). Jokes were not funny, action scenes were dull and watching this took 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. As my friend stated, ""this is no 'Shrek'."""
180,Monster House,2,2 October 2012,"Ecchh... not good for children, not interesting to adults","Parents: do not be fooled by the cute character animation. This is NOT an appropriate film for children under the age of 14. Little ones will be disturbed. The images are too intense and there is too much of them. In addition, the film teaches disrespect for police officers (they are incompetent and incapable of seeing a potential danger). The idea behind the house could have been worked into something much more clever and less predictable. Adults and teenagers will probably find that the film dragged. Was it boring!!! Try something better for your children. I recommend Disney films; specifically, films from the 1970s and before, or perhaps the Francis the Talking Mule series. For horror, just about any of the classic Universal monster movies are fine for the little ones, especially Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy, A & C Meet Dr. Jekkyl and Mr. Hyde, etc."
181,Monster House,6,21 February 2007,Property Impropriety,"*Monster House* takes urban legend ten steps frightfully further by making the neighborhood ""haunted house"" a real MONSTER.Young teen, DJ (voiced by Mitchel Musso) and his portly pal, Chowder (Sam Lerner), find that the menacing house across the street is actually eating people, with tricycles and basketballs as chasers. Owned by sourpuss, Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi  now that's scary!), the whole property can come alive, the front lawn sucking objects underground, an inner carpet serving as a lashing tongue and the nearby trees turning into grabbing claws when necessary.A technical wonderpiece, director Gil Kenan's use of cutting edge ""performance capture"" animation (placing sensors on actors' faces as well as their bodies) and his ingenious tracking camera gives this 3D cartoon the feel of a live action movie. Adults will be technically delighted, teens might be somewhat amused and little kids won't even conceptualize the psychotic horror beneath the surface scares.The characters are so formulaic, I am typing this review with my eyes closed: DJ is the cute hero kid, Chowder, his dumb fat friend, Jenny (Spencer Locke), teen girl whom they both fall in love with, who is smarter than both of them (and who gravitates towards the skinny kid, of course); there's the two-faced babysitter (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the stoner boyfriend (Jason Lee), the dumb cops (one fat and white (Kevin James), one skinny and black (Nick Cannon)); and of course, the oblivious parents (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara).When Nebbercracker has a stroke and is taken to hospital, the three teens try to neutralize the house's voracious appetite  and end up inside it. While they are in the house's maw, the movie does one good thing  it tells us what a uvula is, without condescending, whereas most movies still call it ""that thing that hangs down in the back of your throat."" The kids also find a concrete cast of a fat lady on the basement floor, which cracks open to reveal a skeleton beneath. That's mighty hairy stuff for a pre-teener  and it gets hairier. We find out later that the skeleton belongs to Nebbercracker's dead wife, Constance (Kathleen Turner), who was a Circus Fat Lady (touted as ""the giantess as big as a house"") and was accidentally buried in the concrete while Nebbercracker was building the house for her.In flashbacks, we see that the morbidly obese Constance was a few slices short of a Sara Lee cheesecake, making Nebbercracker's professed love for her almost as bonkers as she was. After she dies, instead of doing the sane thing, like burying her in a reputable cemetery, Nebbercracker constructs a locked cage around her concrete cast  and then wonders why the house could possibly be haunted by her enraged soul. If you can't see how this kind of psychosis disguised as kiddie fare might be too dark for young kids, you must be as unbalanced as Nebbercracker.Before we know it, we're in the third act Running and Screaming phase. And everything gets way out of hand as the house uproots itself and chases the kids and we lose all semblance of wonder.Though Kathleen Turner voices Constance and the monster house, her voice is so subsumed by vocal effects that we realize she was only hired for marquee strength. The ""performance capture"" process raises questions as well  when actors are performing the whole movie with sensors all over them, is it worth the wonderment to go the extra mile in transferring them to 3D cartoons, or is it just an exercise in hedonism? Are studios trying to subvert actors in the long run by ""saving"" their performances digitally to render onto other actors in other films? (One of the digital artists who worked on Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) mentioned offhandedly that they had so much digitized material of their stars (Brody and Watts) that they could put together a whole movie without them.) Ultimately, when *Monster House* wraps - with everything resolving as vanilla as possible - we are left wondering how something so three-dimensional could still be so one-dimensional.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"
182,Monster House,7,29 July 2006,Monster House,"Monster House is a 3D animated movie about two best friends named DJ and Chowder who have an unusual neighbour who they spy on. Soon after watching him and his house they discover that the house is actually alive and will eat and get rid of anyone or anything that steps on the property. With the help of a new friend named Jenny they plan on destroying the house on Halloween night before anyone else gets devoured. Monster House is a fun animated film that has a lot of imagination and some parts that kids will find both funny and a little scary. That being said, the film is fun for adults too. The 3D animation is very well done and looks quite realistic and adults will like some of the more adult jokes in the film and the story has elements of weird and creepy things that will interest kids and anyone who is a fan of books and movies of the same nature. The film even though generally for kids may be a little too scary for some children because while I was watching it a young girl started to cry and had to leave the theatre. The film isn't inappropriate or anything like that, but some scenes may startle and scare younger kids. I liked the creative storyline of the film and it was very entertaining and I liked the weird and creepy things about the house which perked my interest and overall I just found it to be a fun and entertaining film with a lot of originality and well drawn out characters that a lot of recent animated films seem to leave out. This film will definitely be nominated for the new Best Animated Feature award at The Academy Awards and is worthy of the nomination and even to win. For it's great 3D graphics, originality and for just being a plain entertaining film that will work for both adults and kids I give Monster House a recommendation for fans of animation and anything a little creepy or unusual. Kids will absolutely love this movie and thankfully for parents it will work for them too."
183,Monster House,5,24 July 2006,WAY Too Scary for Children - What were they thinking?,"My children (ages 7 & 10) were really excited to see this movie. We had seen trailers at Garfield II and Over the Hedge - other children's movies, and with the PG rating and comments on IMDb, I didn't have any hesitation taking them to see this. What a mistake! The scary scenes are much too intense for children. The house is mean and scary - and not in a good way. The explanation for the ""haunted"" house is probably over my youngest one's head. The scene where the woman dies is almost graphic, just not gory. To put it mildly, my children were terrified. We just saw Pirates of the Caribbean, and it was nowhere near as frightening.Also, I was rather irritated by the mature subject matter between the boyfriend and the babysitter. I don't see any good reason to show him drinking beer, french kissing a stuffed animal, or groping his girlfriend on the couch.Was this intended for children?"
184,Monster House,4,4 February 2009,"Kids don't want feel-good movies anymore...they may not want this, either","Animated comic horrors from ImageMovers and Amblin concerns three kids in a small town who are convinced a spooky old house once belonging to the neighborhood crank is alive and hungry for passersby. Beautiful art direction, composition design and visual conception, fluid camera-work and a fine direction with a good eye for details can't save this story, which is repetitive, derivative, and mercilessly thin. The narrative has gaps which are not helped by the editing, and the dialogue isn't very clever (""You make me wanna throw up in a piece of tinfoil and eat it!""). Has a very promising opening of about fifteen minutes; from there, it creaks and groans to the finish line. *1/2 from ****"
185,Monster House,,13 August 2006,The Serious Eye,"I don't suppose there is any sort of movie project that is as extensively engineered as these animated things. In part its because you can do things you cannot in ""real"" movies. But it is also because when they hit, you make more because you don't have A-list actors taking their cut.The experiment this time has to do with making the camera active. You can do that in three-d animation more easily than in any other technique because once you model the scene you can decided to place and move the camera in any way. Its not quite as easy because backgrounds are modeled differently.The motion capture technique used here is especially handy for these sorts of experiments because you have real actors creating the movements, so you don't have to decide ahead of time what looks good. You can ""shoot"" the scene and then discover what looks good afterward.Its Hitchcock that invented the notion of a curious camera and Altman that advanced that to the notion of arriving in a perspective just enough late to give the impression that you are discovering it. Kar Wai Wong now plays with the rhythms of anticipated and delayed viewing.Its exciting stuff. And its why this movie was made. And its what you might go to see it for  the story is ordinary, though once again our girl is redheaded. That's another engineered thing.Look here at how active the camera is, especially at the beginning. It almost never does something that a ""real"" camera cannot, but it moves in a way that is practically impossible for a real camera, even to today. In fact it seems that the camera is deliberately moved in ways we aren't used to seeing. And that's exciting, folks.So much the better that the story involves a human incarnated into a space. This way, you get to see and participate in two incarnated spaces warring, the ""house"" - woman and the movie - us.I haven't had this much visual fun since the last big experiment of this kind: ""Nemo."" Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
186,Monster House,5,22 July 2006,Monstrous Disappointment,"It's a Saturday Morning Kids Cartoon. Period. That's it. I have to say this up front because most will defend it as such. ""Oh, c'mon. It's a kids' movie."" They're right. That's all it is. Too bad. 'Problem is: it's touted as a big-time summer fun movie. And with names like Spielberg and Zemeckis (who both did terrific ""Amazing Stories"" episodes that I expected this might be reminiscent of) one expects more. (On a side note, there's a bit of rather mean-spirited if not 'perverse' stuff in this movie. Perhaps that's okay for today's 'modern child' but I think it steals away from it being solid 'family entertainment.' Also, it's so convoluted and shameless in its set-ups that I don't think any kid under ten will be able to follow the twisted backstory.) I expected perhaps something for everyone: the kids would be entertained by some stuff, and the adults would also have a good share of fun too. No such luck. This movie is NO SHREK. NO ICE AGE. NO TOY STORY, NO CARS, NO fill-in-the-blank PIXAR movie. If you have no expectations and you can just drop off the kids (and you don't care that the movie has some rather mean-spirited stuff) then this movie's an okay babysitter. And: Who is this guy that directed it? Where did he come from? Is he a CGI technician? BTW: The pee-pee humor would have been more fun if it were at least consistent! The doggie is apparently first a female...and then...just for the joke....it's a male. My God, am I asking too much for consistent potty humor!?"
187,Monster House,,18 July 2006,"If you're a kid, well . . . .","Monster House may be the scariest kid movie ever made. A house terrorizes neighborhood kids, not just any house but the living embodiment of a very fat circus lady loved by the house's owner.The three Potter-like youngsters endure pain and suffering to help the alleged monster in the house (Steve Buscemi) deal with his circus porker. The thrills are of the disturbing, for the kids a thrown about like magnetized junk at a dump site. But, hey, what do you want for a horror animation that satisfies the best fears of young personsGeorge Bush's Iraq policy? The special film process, which goes from actors to animation, is similar to the effect in Polar Express, but better facial expressions. Monster House is slow in the setupdo wait around. If you're an adult, you're likely to look at the eyesore on your block with new respect. If you're a kid, well, you'll have to grow up before you get the courage to rehab the 'hood."
188,Monster House,2,2 August 2006,Inappropriate for most audiences,"Despite what the promos and some critics are billing this as, IT IS NOT A FAMILY FILM. From what I had heard prior to seeing it, I came into the theater thinking I was going to see a decent family film with just a little bit of rude child humor and a few scares. What I saw before I walked out of the theater was every expectation of mine failing on an level that can only be described as abysmal.Yes, the animation is good. But that's the only thing this movie has going for it. It's also the only reason why I gave it a 2.First off, the movie begins with the death of a disgruntled old man, which becomes such a pivotal point in the movie that the characters feel the need to make a joke of it.Next on my list is the not-so-hidden oral sex joke. When the character Bones is telling the babysitter Zee about the legend of the house, while drinking what is clearly a beer, he tells her that the old man's wife died because he 'ate' her. He then jumps on Zee (behind the couch so we can't see what they're doing) where she seems to fight with him and says that he has no respect for women. She kicks him out of the house, where he goes to the 'Monster House' and, in a drunken stupor, gets devoured by said Monster House.The next day, Zee wakes up and goes to find a young red haired girl at the door selling candy. (I can't remember her name, probably because I prefer not to or because by this point in the movie I just outright didn't care.) Eventually they make their way up to the room, where the two boys have been all night watching the house. They also have clearly urinated in bottles so that they can keep constant watch over the house. Don't worry, if your kids haven't figured that out yet, the movie will make it a point to tell them.By this point, Davy Jones had walked into the theater and offered me the deal of serving 100 years on his ship to delay me from seeing the end of the movie. In the spirit of ""hoping the movie would get better"", I declined his request. He then must have moved on and talked to the family in front of me, because shortly after said urine in bottles scene, they departed to work alongside his crew of miscreants. Or left to see a better movie.The next was YET ANOTHER oral sex joke, much in the same of the first. They say that Bones has been 'eaten alive' by something. Zee replies with an irritated face and tone the name of a girl, implying some kind of perversive act.The next part (which was where I walked out) was when the two cops showed up. I realize that while the black cop was supposed to be a rookie cop, he still came across as another token black character put into a film to appease the black community and be entertainment for the white community.Said acts of bad writing, bad timing, and bad choices by the director lead me to give you only one recommendation about this movie: It is much better enjoyed not through 3-D glasses or the naked eye, but rather through the simple act of ""not going to see this movie."""
189,Monster House,4,26 August 2006,Terrible.,"I find it hard to write 10 paragraphs about this movie. Suffice to say the once mighty Steven Spielberg hit rock bottom with this movie. It was an interesting concept, marred by some of the worst CGI I've ever seen, bad jokes on a kids' movie, and bizarre situations that would have been OK on a PG-13 movie.I still wonder - who was this movie aimed for? Kids? No way. It's too scary, and several comments or situations are quite embarrassing. Young teens? I don't think so - it's too ""lame"" and childish. Adults? Nah. It's boring and a bit dumb. This could have been a great idea - sadly, it's just an uncomfortable mess."
190,Monster House,,3 November 2011,Those 3 Faces !,"It's a horror, starring kids, while being  mainly  not for kids. It's a 3D that resembles live-action movies while being not a live-action movie. Making a horror starring kids is one thing I can understand in a world where kids became accustomed to horror (or became The Horror themselves !). But a 3D that resembles live-action movies ? Why ?! Maybe that was to earn a novel element, whereas it gives rare artistic merits; different image, vital pace, unusual camera's moving, wild special effects, cheaper explosions..etc. Maybe for experimenting new dimension?, or for the heck of it, being a director's caprice? Or maybe because the actors gave the producers such a big headache, so why not replacing them with graphics ! Whatever the reason is, it is a good movie. The idea is bold, with that monster house. Every monster house in any haunted house movie is annoying from the inside, this one is annoying, impressively by the way, from the outside too. In fact, I loved its outside to the extent that I wished for a prequel to savor such a character! The script is solid and unpredictable. The direction dazzled me for most of the time. And it's fun to watch as a horror or E.T.-ish movie with heroic children as leads. So, what could be wrong ?!First of all, the design of the characters SUCKS. They are untalented and forgettable to say the least. Save the grumpy old man, I couldn't find any interesting, rather bearable, character around. Look at the girl, Jenny, how pathetic ! Simply, if being damn realistic was the point, why not making it as a live action instead? Otherwise, they paid attention to everything in this 3D, except the characters. Not only this, the level of animation was embarrassingly weak for an American movie. Re-watch the first scene of the cops to have a good idea. According to this movie using 3D motion capture techniques to digitally record the physical performances of the actors before ""skinning"" them with their animated forms proved to be something dull, that has no quality of other cartoon, 3D, or live action movies, neither a special quality for itself ! Some points in the script looked artless. I mean, the girl is there, putting her life on edge for what exactly? She was about to be eaten, she's curious, or she's in love? I don't think so. The monster wife was an obvious insult to the fat or the retarded people, a point that could have been easily avoided by for instance saying that she was originally a black magic deranged witch or something evil anyway ! The movie's sense of humor was between dry and plain gross. So every single supposed-to-be-funny line ended up, at best, as ridiculously dirty (urine, puberty, how to puke, not going to the bathroom for 4 days !). And seriously, how come a movie with scary, dark and dirty stuff like this earns a PG rating ?!Ironically the performances of the minor characters were way better than the leads'. See how (Steve Buscemi), (Fred Willard) and (Catherine O'Hara) steal the show with short moments. The matter gets clearer  and more painful  with (Kathleen Turner) achieving a lot with only 2 or 3 words as a role! Apparently (Mitchel Musso), (Sam Lerner), and (Spencer Locke), the 3 kids who played the leads, have yet so much to learn. Its imagination wins. The way it carries out itself wins, mostly. A few of it loses. So it's overall good. But if, at least, the 3 main characters' faces were something any preferable, and not to be Disney's either, I would have given it the ""very good"" rank gladly.P.S : after seeing the movie's director (Gil Kenan), I knew after whom the character of DJ was modeled !"
191,Monster House,5,8 December 2008,It was totally Fun and Awesome,"The movie was totally fun and awesome. The Monster House was very cool. Amongst the humans, Chowder was very cute, and he is very funny. Even, the last scene was totally thrilling. When DJ, Chowder and Jenny are in the monster house, that scene is totally interesting. When, Chowder is going to the monster house, that scene it is totally thrilling. When, the monster house is taking the car inside the house's mouth with the three children inside, that scene is totally awesome. Chowder was very funny in the last scene. If, anyone comes near the house that time the house is eats them are do something to them badly, that time it is very cool. I think the monster house is the villain of the movie. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Monster House""."
192,Monster House,7,8 March 2008,Interestingly Inappropriate Adult-Oriented Animation,"Unlike many other reviewers, I would not allow children, even of the age of the ones in this movie, to see this film. It is inappropriate on too many levels. Encourages stealing (the end justifies the means morality), is too frightening, makes the unusual looking people literally ""freaks"" in sideshows treated like the ""monsters"" they are. The only redeeming feature is the message that one shouldn't judge on first appearances, though that is exactly what the writers do as a fat woman is literally made a monster and another fat character a buffoon while the ""normal"" kid gets the ""normal"" girl. Children suddenly realize that the house next door is possessed and, left to their own devices by absentee parents and babysitters (another problematic plot element), they set out to destroy the house and free the old man who is held its prisoner lo these many years.The animation is fantastic, perhaps a little too good, since I found myself distracted by it several times. It takes away from the story when you're wondering ""What would that texture FEEL like?"" oh, it's animation...several times. The 3D effect is wonderful and it is enthralling, just a little distracting from time to time, never quite sure whether it wants to mimic reality (as in the photorealistic leaves throughout) or be putty-like in its characters, or more cartoon-oriented. Cartoonishness may have lessened my feelings of apprehension at some of the messages being sent to children (assumed to be at least part of the audience for an animated movie), but it was too real too often to allow that and the effect is not only the intended fear of the story, but fear of what poor role model messages children were picking up in the process.It's not on the class of the monstrously inappropriate sick styles of The Corpse Bride or Nightmare before Christmas, but it is not a family or children oriented movie either.For adults, and especially adult fans of animation and suspense I think it's worth the watch. But certainly not for children, even older ones, by any means."
193,Monster House,7,2 January 2008,Surprised it was so good.,"First hearing the idea of the CGI film, this sounds very lame. An evil house, people getting eaten by it. Luckily, instead, this film proves NOT to lack the genres excitement, fear, teamwork, humour, girl-hugging-boy, ghost and fun! These and more make up a good film.WARNING: This film is rated PG for a reason. It is much scarier than it might look (the monster house is surprisingly horrifying) and is mainly recommended for children aged 10 and over, anyone younger than that will be liable to have at least one nightmare because of this film.DJ and Chowder are two boys who are only friends with each other. DJ is surprisingly weak and often feels bullied, while Chowder is just plain dirty and silly. DJ becomes very nervous of the house across the road, home to Mr. Nebbercracker. DJ feels there is something strange and wrong about the house and with his friend Chowder and a newly met girl named Jenny are determined to investigate...Enjoy the frightening and bewitching ""Monster House""! :-)7 and a half out of ten."
194,Monster House,8,31 March 2007,pretty fun and exciting 3d animated movie(though some kids under 13 may find it a bit intense),"in my my mind,this is a pretty good movie.it's a stop motion/CGI 3d animation combination.it's a very fun movie.it would be easy to see how scary it would be for young children,as there are some thrilling sequences and scenes of peril.i think it might be too much for young kids,and i would have rated it PG13,instead of just PG.i think most kids over 13 would enjoy it.i thought the animation was well done and the voice actors suited their characters well.the movie is very entertaining and pretty fast paced.if you enjoyed this movie,you might also like ""ice Age and ""Ice Age 2,as well ""Toy Story 1 and 2""and ""The Incredibles"".for me, ""Monster House"" is an 8/10"
195,Monster House,8,24 March 2007,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!,"oooooh this film was so good. For each generation of children there is a new breed of animation film. First there was my generation, Toy Story...then the next Finding Nemo and now Monster House for the kids today.The effects were top notch, and the attention to detail was brilliant. And for it to be the directors first project i was amazed that he pulled off this brilliant film.The humour suites all people, even though they are kids. I used to think that computer animated films depersonalised the characters, but this film proved me wrong. The characters moved realistically and the voices fitted extremely well. Even though the film lasts just over 1hr30mins the characters are defined really well. And the story line was strong too.I would advise to watch this even if you don't have kids, its definitely cheers you up if your ill and cant move of the sofa :)!"
196,Monster House,4,24 March 2007,The Burbs dumbed down a bit for the kiddies,"Take The ""Burbs with Tom Hanks, animate it, change the evildoers into a possessed/living house, remove the Tom Hanks charm and there you have Monster House. D.J. lives across the road from an angry, cranky old man who confiscates any toy or bike or ball that ends up on his precious lawn. Jimmy's friend Chowder's new basketball ends up on the lawn and Jimmy tries to help him out. Mr. Nebbercracker comes out and throws such a fit that he gives himself a heart attack. Jimmy, feels somewhat responsible, but can't help but notice strange behavior from the house which has no occupants. It has smoke coming from the chimney and lights on at certain hours. The house may be associated with the disappearance of a young hoodlum too. Well, they've got to solve this mystery and try to trick the threatening house into revealing itself. It gets sillier and eventually moves beyond the realms of good story, trying to use ridiculous plot lines to keep the story interesting.This kid's movie is rated PG, and the house's early victims are found to still be alive at the end to avoid a PG-13 rating. I watched this with my daughter who is almost 5. I could see she was a little scared by the ferocity of the house as it starts to release its vengeance. To my queries she assured me that she was brave, so it was okay, but could she please sit on my lap. And try as I might, I don't think she understands the concept of vengeful spirits and possession.This movie is like Kroger brand, or Hyvee brand or Alberstons brand fruit punch. The idea of fruit punch can be appealing and it is expected to be manufactured. No one is expecting their fruit punch in the gallon jug to be made from real fruit but when you take a sip of the bright red drink you realize it is composed of too much sugar, making it overly sweet, lots of food coloring, mostly water and not very much of any other flavor, making it a watery drink with a sugar rush. 3.5/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"
197,Monster House,7,21 February 2007,"A good movie, just maybe too spooky for young kids","This movie is definitely not for young kids. Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but it may be a tad too spooky for kids. If Nebbecracker and Constance weren't frightening enough, it deals with death very bluntly when showing Constance's grave in the basement of the house. And if that wasn't eerie enough, it really drives homes the nightmares when the house comes completely to life and begins chasing the kids. I'm glad I watched it before my kids did. The movie is still good though. It is somewhat reminiscent of ""Goonies"" or ""The Monster Squad"" in that you have kids going through an adventure to save the day. A good movie, but please reserve for kids above the age of 10."
198,Monster House,,24 December 2006,Straw Foundations.,"Old hat haunted house story with kids trying to save the day in the tradition of those corny after school specials that used to dominate the airwaves of network television. Still ""Monster House"" is not a bad little ride though in spite of its pedestrian animation and unoriginal story. Admittedly, the characters are fun to watch and the mystery does keep the audience intrigued. However, the plot's explanation is turned in too fast and the picture's climax seems routine and even a bit dull. With all this said though, ""Monster House"" should be a nice little change for those kids in the pre-teen and early-teen age range. Too heavy for the youngest age groups and too routine for more discriminating audiences. 4 stars out of 5."
199,Monster House,10,20 November 2006,perfect!,"an absolutely perfect homage to the great zemeckis/spielberg films of the eighties. everything, the fake video game the elder kid plays at the arcade to the the character name 'chowder' are so seamlessly fitting this feels like a lost treasure from an era where you could actually kill characters in front of children (which sounds horrible written that way).the plot doesn't matter. it's the same plot as everything else, this is all in the execution. taking itself completely seriously, with no audience winks or 'adult' jokes, this movie feels like exactly what people wanted to make in the 80s, but didn't have the technology to explore. no, it's not genuinely scary, but it is engaging as hell. by the end of the film, with the tracking shot from the crane you FEEL for these characters, and they all get to be heroes.the voice acting is top-notch and everyone really seems to 'get it'. it's also beautiful, to boot.possibly the best non-pixar 3D film EVER.10/10"

201,Monster House,7,24 October 2006,A decent animation flick,"I have to admit that I had high expectations for Monster House, after all, I am a big fan of Steven Spielberg. He's great with a typical drama involving non-animation, so I was curious how he would do with an animation film. But honestly, I think I was a little disappointed, I was expecting more humor than spooks. I understand that this is a kid's horror movie, but still, it needed more relief for the audience.But Monster House is about three kids: DJ, Chowder, and Jenny, they are investigating a spooky house of the neighborhood, they've just witnessed it eating people! Since the creepy old owner is in the hospital, they take a tour inside the house finding out what makes it work and how they can destroy it, before it eats the whole neighborhood! Monster House had great animation, it is truly amazing how real those kids looked, it almost proved how we may no longer need actors in Hollywood in the near future. But like I said, there wasn't enough humor to really grab me, not to mention, some of the content, I guess depending on the age of the audience, just seemed a little too teenager or adult. Still, I wouldn't deny this was a good film, just wished that it met my expectations or at least a little higher.7/10"
202,Monster House,3,23 October 2006,Plagiarized?,"Has Joe R Lansdale been credited for writing this? If not, this is just plain plagiarism from his short story ""The Shaggy House"". Except that in that story the people who found out about the monster house were two old men, not kids. Either that or his children's book. I quote Joe R. Lansdale from the foreword to ""The Shaggy House"":""Another story inspired by THE NIGHTRUNNERS.In the book there's a scene where one of my characters sees the house where he is soon to live for the first time, and I gave a sort of over-the-top description of it that I thought worked quite well in context, but there was something in that description that spurred me to consider the house from another angle, a less grim one. What came out was this short story. It's a gonzo hoot with an echo of Bradbury and a lot of tongue in cheek.My title was ""Something Lumber This Way Comes,"" which my friend Bill Nolan, to put it mildly, hated. He suggested this title. Since I used the other title on a variation of this story which became a children's book, I agreed. Secretly, I still prefer the original title.""end of quote by Joe R.Lansdale"
203,Monster House,8,24 September 2006,Good for children,"This movie is actually nice to see with your 5 year old. My 5-year old is starting to get scared of things that just cannot be explained and I do not want her to be. I would like her to know there is a reason behind anything that happens to her. They will not only learn this in the movie, but also know how she can make a difference. It was a wonderfully made movie, the animation was so lively, you would think the characters were alive. Also, I would like to make a change on the information. Neighbourhood Crimes & Peepers is not what it is called in the Philippines. It is also Monster House. No one would've probably watched it if it was named like that here."
204,Monster House,7,24 August 2006,MONSTER HOUSE : Fine Entertainment & Great Animation... But Who's It For?,"MONSTER HOUSE MONSTER HOUSE is the second film by Robert Zemeckis to utilize the digital capture of human actors in creating a CGI world. Personally, the animation from this procedure has improved greatly since it's introduction with THE POLAR EXPRESS, however, the film itself is slightly misguided. MONSTER HOUSE tells the story of two neighborhood children, D.J. and Chowder, who are fascinated by what goes on at the house across the street. Anything that touches the yard incites immediate fury from the old man who lives there, and once something lands on his grass it is brought into the house never to be seen again.One day D.J. and Chowder trespass in an attempt to prove their maturity. Then when the old man comes out to scold them in his usual manner, the man suffers from what appears to be a heart attack and dies. This leaves D.J. and Chowder thinking the evil on their street is over. However, slowly they realize it was never actually the man wreaking havoc on their neighborhood... instead, it was the house itself, which turns out to be alive and has an appetite for anyone who steps upon it's yard.MONSTER HOUSE is an interesting concept that I've been leery of since I first heard of it. It seems too far fetched to have a living, breathing house living on a block with normal everyday Americans. However, MONSTER HOUSE manages to make things believable enough in the context of the film. The animation truly is something to behold, and even though I didn't see the film in it's 3-D format, there were moments where the picture seemed to be leaping out at me.The influence of Steven Spielberg (a producer on the film) is also strongly apparent. Though entirely different in concept, the film follows a similar structure to those you'd see in some of Spielberg's best adventure films (INDIANA JONES or THE GOONIES for example). Like those films, MONSTER HOUSE is consistently entertaining and well-paced with a great balance of humor and thrills.The problem with the film though is where those humor and thrills are being aimed. Essentially, this is a kid's movie because it was marketed as such. Granted, it is rated PG, but no previews seemed to genuinely warn parents of the extent to which this film pushes the boundaries of family entertainment. With a great deal of jokes regarding puberty, underage drinking, children ****ing into bottles, and more... the film left me uncomfortable at times. Not because I personally was offended by the jokes (as a matter of fact, many of them are very funny), but I constantly caught myself thinking... this doesn't seem right! On top of that, MONSTER HOUSE definitely doesn't skimp on the actual scares. Some moments genuinely made me jump, and I can't imagine how a young audience would feel watching the movie.On it's own MONSTER HOUSE is a good source of entertainment, however it doesn't seem to really know what it's audience is. That doesn't mean I didn't have a fun night at the movies, but I can't bring myself to fully appreciate the piece. It doesn't seem well suited for the audience it's marketed for (youth), nor does it appeal fully to an older market. Nonetheless, I was incredibly leery of the concept from the day I first read about it and the film at least managed to eclipse those reservations. It's entertaining and exciting, but not very cohesive.... B- ..."
205,Monster House,10,23 August 2006,wicked!!!!,watch this film me and my family found this film a 10/10 brilliant yet different I'm loving the story line and the characters i will be buying this film monster house when it comes out on DVD to add to my collection of many but this will be far one of the best in the animation collection great for children great for teens great for adults great for any age so yes you cant go wrong i personally think the cinema is over priced but this film was worth every penny every pound every note i paid to watch it most films seem to be based on the same kind of story lines as other films but this one is full of fresh new original ideas i could not compare to another film it has its own and great ideas......i could say a lot more but i will leave it to your opinions!!!!
206,Monster House,9,21 August 2006,What a film. Not at ALL what you expect,"Although I hate to one of those people who write in late about a movie, I've only recently started using IMDb, so catch ups are all I have for the moment! Anyway. MONSTER HOUSE... My boyfriend and I went into this movie, like most other adult movie goers, just to see what it was like, and if it was worth taking the niece and nephew to. Well. From the outset I had the feeling this wasn't your ordinary ""punching a quick kid's movie out to make a few quid"" type of movie.As mentioned by others, the direction for me was absolutely atypical of animated movies. I loved the was that Chowder was able to act more than a little mental, and have his eccentricities really come out in the animation. Fair enough, they do look like they have plastic hair, but I was fairly astounded that you could pick out the woollen stitching on DJ's jumper. All the characters in this film are really well thought out, and I actually liked the addition of ""Skull"", for the brief time he was on screen (In my opinion a little under-used, but what can you do?). The whole film had a ""Real"" feel to it, not solely the animation, but also in the ways that the characters interacted... you could easily imaging these scenes happening on a typical American suburban street. I would recommend this film to all ages, as for the young (who may not be scared, but will certainly be entertained), it contains enough action and comedy to keep them amused, and for the adults, aside from checking out the animation, they can chuckle throughout the film as Chowder goes from one embarrassing statement to another."
207,Monster House,7,20 August 2006,Not great thing but better that a lot of animated films,"The Polar express is a boring animated film that the only good thing is the 3D animation.From that movie's creators,comes Monster House that is way better than that movie and better than a lot of animated films.The movie kept me fun.The 3D animation is simply SPECTACULAR.I have to say that it's not an animated film for all kids.I would recommend this movie to children of 10 years old and up.Monster house is a very fun movie way better that almost crap animated films(like Ice age 2 or Brother bear) but it's not at the same level of masterpieces in the animation like The Incredibles or Princess Mononoke.But,like I said before,Monster house is very fun."
208,Monster House,8,12 August 2006,Unflinchingly fun movie!,"Just got back from seeing this - Monster House is an all out fun movie for all ages with some fantastic visuals and great innovations. The animation is top notch, and Kenan controls like he's been in the game for years. I'd recommend this to anyone that has a heart. It maybe wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be, as well as a little predictable, but it's done so well that these can. Great music from Pipes, particularly in the climactic sequence which in itself is superbly done. The monster house is very well animated and even slightly scary. I guarantee you'll have a good time if you go and see this movie, provided you're not a prude that has to think everything has to be realistic and believable. Pure escapism.Bottom line, go see it!"
209,Monster House,10,12 August 2006,Brilliant,"I went to see this film without knowing too much about it except for the fact that Steven Spielberg was involved in some way. I'm so glad that I did go because this film had everything!!! Scary, funny, a decent story, great action sequences, nostalgia (growing up with one weird mate!), dialogue. Even the style of animation was one that suited the story very well and was at least something different from the standard CGI look. The one criticism that I did have was that I took a young relative to see it and he did get quite frightened as the house looks pretty scary, but then I think this was a mistake on my part as i didn't fully check it out beforehand.This is definitely one to watch. So much so that straight after the film everyone wanted to watch it again! Especially the 3D version!"
210,Monster House,7,11 August 2006,One weird-a$$ movie! Not for little kids. Intriguing for adults though.,"This movie is definitely a mix of realities. First, despite the Spielberg imprimatur, it is NOT for small children. Even with the cartoon patina of happy-happy, this is a very DARK movie! Also, the animation was disturbingly uber realistic. Usually superb animation is a plus in a cartoon. But these scenes, while colourful, true-to-life, etc., were distractingly so. I had the conscious thought that I wasn't seeing anything that couldn't be shown with regular film. Rather than pleasing the eye, it was, in fact, subtly and persistently confusing to the eye. There were a few small exceptions to that--- the house frowning, for example. But mostly, I could have been watching an after-school special.The cast is good. No doubt about that. But some of the characters they were asked to portray were less than admirable. Don't want to give the ending away (so I won't). Be do be warned, especially if you are thinking of taking tykes along, that much of this movie is gross, scary, and violent. And... as an adult, while I was a bit Scroogey for the first half (it's slow), by the end I was mildly enjoying myself."
211,Monster House,8,10 August 2006,Great movie. Smart dialogues!,"Well, we are talking about a very nice animation movie. The characters although they look a little fake and strange are very good and the overall feeling viewing this movie is the best. The basketball scene on the beginning shows in the best way the possibilities of this movie's programmers and designers. Lovely scene. Also there are many smart jokes in the movie that made me laugh enough. Good Job. I'd say that this movie is not for children under 12 or something. It's not only scary but most kids will also not understand the funny parts of the movie.So, they'll miss a lot. It's for older minds in my opinion. The scenario is good written and maybe the whole movie has a few deeper messages to pass, except what we see in the first place. I have not completed this thought in my mind yet. Conclusion: Good scenario, funny acting. Takes the world of animation movies one step further. Not for small kids."
212,Monster House,7,8 August 2006,Destined to Become an Annual Halloween Favourite,"I quite enjoyed this. There was a great ""Goonies""-vibe and it reminded me a lot of being a kid in the 80s. The animation on the house itself was spectacular! There was so much movement going on all over it, it must have been quite a task to accomplish but I think they did a great job. The human characters were nowhere near as well-developed. Nothing can beat ""The Incredibles"" for that (so far).S P O I L E R SI'm all for movies where pre-pubescent kids steal drugs, break and enter, play with explosives and operate heavy construction equipment without supervision. However, there were a few plot things I was not a fan of. I didn't like that the monster had to be an overweight woman and further, that the ""fat kid"" was mainly used for comic relief. Of course the two slim, Caucasian leads have to end up together in a heterosexual union. Whatever, I guess maybe the drugs and and explosives balance it out. As a former fat kid I'm probably a tad oversensitive about that issue.This was entertaining and I'd say it's destined to become an annual Halloween favourite."
213,Monster House,7,8 August 2006,Decent mix of laughs and chills in this winning animated horror/comedy,"MONSTER HOUSE (2006) **1/2(VOICES OF: Mitchel Musso, Sam Lerner, Spencer Locke, Steve Buscemi, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Lee, Kevin James, Nick Cannon, Catherine O' Hara, Fred Willard, Jon Heder, Kathleen Turner) Decent mix of laughs and chills in this winning animated horror/comedy about a trio of kids discovering their neighbor's house is more than haunted with a blend of top-notch animation and sprinkled with enough goosebumps along the way that should make most kids happy yet not an instant classic.Executive produced by Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg. (Dir: Gil Kenan)"
214,Monster House,4,4 August 2006,Mostly Terrible,"First of all, let me say that I did not see the polar express, so this is my first time seeing Real D's motion capture, and it was excellent. And the basic story was fairly descent. And that is where the quality ends. The jokes all fell flat, there did not seem to be any characters who existed in the world other than those who have direct effect on the story. (How did nobody notice that there was an enormous house rampaging through the streets?) I am all for the suspension of disbelief, but come on. And I also love kids movies, and the scary atmosphere was there. But it had nothing to back it up. Save your money, go see Miami Vice instead."
215,Monster House,8,3 August 2006,An excellent movie.,"I had seen the previews on TV and it looked super funny. I went to see it Saturday with my Aunt and cousions (One's 4 and one's 3). And, I have to say, it was really good! I thought the animation was great, the background to me looked almost real! I had orignally wanted to see this because of Chowder from the previews. He seemed hilarious! I was right about that.But the only scene that sort of scared me was the dream that DJ had. I jumped up a little at that part and the woman with the baby behind me cursed.I get back to the Chowder thing. I thought he was a CGI Chunk from ""The Goonies"" his lines were hysterical. I found myself laughing so hard at some of the things he said.At first I thought this would be too scary for my cousions. They didn't complain at all, except that it was *Too* loud in the theater.Other than that, it was pretty good. To me it's the horror movie for children. Hopefully this will be out on DVD soon and so that it could be added to my Christmas Wish-list."
216,Monster House,5,2 August 2006,"Generally entertaining mix of shock, silliness, and schmaltz...","""Monster House,"" the latest computer-animated venture to enter theaters, is rife with the kind of images and lines that take me back to the warm nostalgia of childhood, when a 30-minute episode of ""The Real Ghostbusters"" or ""Scooby-Doo"" (hell, even ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"") was enough to hold my undivided attention. This was also back when adults were frightening creatures and members of the opposite sex were at once appealing and perplexing. During its best moments, ""Monster House"" wields an imaginative story backed up by images that are, creepy, humorous, and visually dazzling--the stuff of chuckles for adults, and bad dreams for the kiddies. While the tale of wholesome neighborhood kids investigating the strange occurrences at the creepy Old Man Nebbercracker's house across the street, only to discover his decayed, foreboding homestead is holding a secret, often smacks of ""Home Alone"" schmaltz, but is satisfactory (considering how uninspired the plots of animated films often are, the writers should be credited for at least trying something original). ""Monster House"" succeeds in producing a creative nightmare interior/exterior to the titular structure, but it is really in the moments of 'growing up suburbia' that the film shines: the Gothed-out babysitter and her Trent Reznor-doppleganger boyfriend; the pizza-delivery dork/video game wizard; the clueless parents (voiced by the underused Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard); the clean-cut neighborhood girl who sets our male protagonists aflutter with puppy love; and the cranky, cadaverous old man who you half-expect to growl at the kids for meddling with his plans. While brilliantly designed and animated, ""Monster House""'s Third-Act Revelation comes off as a rushed contrivance, and for all the visual gags, the dialog comes off as underwritten--the humor is never as sharp as the film's looks. That being said, this is a sturdy, light entertainment that knows its audience."
217,Monster House,8,2 August 2006,Better than Toy Story,"I saw this movie when i sneaked into the movie theaters, boy was that a good idea. I was curious to see because in the previews the animation was way better than James and the giant peach, and toy story, and all those other pixar films put together. i liked the movie a lot in general. its not only a kid movie, hey i sneaked in to see it and i don't really watch cartoons any more but this one was really great. I'll guarantee that anyone who watched it would really like it. It seems a bit Tim Burton-ish because its a bit dark. Steven Soeilburg really helped it out. Didn't think he had the ability to do good in this movie because i was disappointed in some of his movies but this one was terrific. The characters overall had funny personalities. Chowder=Hilarious."
218,Monster House,10,1 August 2006,Great Movie!,"I LOVED this movie SO MUCH! The writing was brilliant, The animation was magnificent, and above all, the acting was terrific! The movie starts out with a little girl riding her trike down the side walk (all sweet and what not) singing and saying hello to everything. She wrecks her trike and the lawn of a very creepy house. She tries to get away and this old dude comes out and screams at her and brakes her trike while she runs away. You find out a little boy was watching the whole thing through his telescope through his window across the street and has been documenting every movement on the house. Along the way we meet lovable characters, twisting events, and a very odd house. One thing I don't understand is this. Along the way, we are introduced to his very hot babysitter, but both the kid and his friend 'fall in love' with this other girl saying Halloween candy! I would SO go after his baby sitter!"
219,Monster House,,30 July 2006,A Great and Funny Film,"It was a really great kid's 'horror'film.The plot is well - written. {You can't see that from the trailers because it would have spoiled the ending} It has humor for kids, adults, and even teenagers! Now, just because it's an animated film, does not make it OK for young children. There are scene which some people might call ""intense for children"". The plot deals with things like murder, death, and even puberty. I am a teenager so I found this film very funny. Since, I've seen real horror films I didn't find it really suspenseful, but again younger kids might.The ending is great. It's a huge twist. You think the films going one way, but it makes a turn. I also found the ending sad, but happy in a way.I think this film beats Cars for the title of the years's (so for) best family film!"
220,Monster House,7,30 July 2006,Monster House,"Once I found out about this was being made I had pretty high expectations for this, It didn't quite live up to them but I found it very enjoyable. I found myself smiling more than laughing during the film, there were a couple chuckles at a couple Chowder jokes. There were a couple scenes that could be a little intense for the youngsters but overall I think kids will find this more cool than scary. Oh the cus words from the clips that showed up on MySpace were cut out, I was a little bummed out about that. A solid cast did a good job especially the kids and great direction from Kenan. The animation of everything was great not the just house but that was the best part of the animation and the look of the film was great to, it had a very distinct look different from the animated films that we've been seeing lately that's what makes it stand out. I'm hoping the films legs will stabilize and families will go see this instead of ""The Ant Bully"" which didn't to well at the box office so that should die out quickly and there doesn't seem to be to much excitement for ""Barnyard"" so I'm crossing my fingers that ""Monster House will creep towards the 100 million mark. I give it a solid B."
221,Monster House,10,28 July 2006,A Great Movie- Not Made For Kids - But Refreshing for Adults,"I loved this movie! I'm one that does not like watching scary movies.But this was a cartoon, so what could be that scary about it? Well, I can say that if the events that happened in the movie, happened in a ""real life"" movie, I wouldn't watch it.But I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it was something I usually wouldn't watch.This movie is definitely not for children under 8-10.Some of the dialog even is above the children's heads who may go see it.I just really enjoyed this movie.If you don't expect it to be hilariously cute and funny just because it's a cartoon, you will like it :)."
222,Monster House,9,28 July 2006,Scary and Funny! Some frightening images,"I saw this movie last night, and I absolutely loved it. The characters are very fun and intriguing, the plot is very entertaining, and the special effects (CG) are impressive. Depending on your child's age, consider the image of a house coming to life and being extremely angry; having a mind of its own, and having a face. The images certainly caught my attention, and a little kid may be frightened by the thought of a house being alive and wanting to hurt them. Although, it is a happy ending, so that might help, and there's a lot of cute humor to keep it lighthearted. It's a very real cartoon that's a good clean scare. If you haven't looked at the cast of characters yet (which you probably have the way the site is set up) then Don't!! It's a lot of fun for the adults to recognize the voices of the awesome cast members (and more fun to spend time trying to recognize them). This movie reminds me of scary stories I was told as a child, and it is a good reflection of how children can imagine things that adults find impossible, until they see it for themselves. And it reminds parents that their kids are intelligent/brave at an earlier age than one might think. It seems to illustrate a Scooby-do mixed with Goonies feel, as you'll see with the ""Chunk/Chowder"" character, and the creepy old man behind the whole thing. I saw it with a friend, and we both really enjoyed it, and we didn't scream once, but we did gasp a couple times. :)"
223,Monster House,10,27 July 2006,Wicked Movie!,"DJ (Mitchel Musso), a 13 year-old boy started spying on his neighbor across the street once he noticed weired things occurring on the lawn. The grass would suck in a wheel and bury it within the earth, or when you step on the lawn, Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) would automatically jump out of his evil house like he was always watching you.When Chowder (Sam Lerner) accidentally through his ball on the mysterious lawn, Nebbercracker came out attacking DJ. DJ fighting for his life gave the old man a scare, killing him. Instantly smoke shot out from the chimney of the house. Suddenly the walls came to life.Static phone calls from Nebbercracker's abandoned house wasn't the only weired thing that was happening to DJ. Doors and windows would randomly open, and even people would start to go missing once they pass the house. This wild adventure has DJ, along with Chowder and Jenny to discover the mystery of Nebbercracker and put the evil house to it's rest! I would give this movie a BIG 10-10. It always kept you in the action. And for a CGI film, I would have to say this movie is for ALL ages!"
224,Monster House,8,26 July 2006,It was sure better than Polar Express!,"I saw this movie on opening day because it was hot and I had nothing better to do. I wanted to see this movie, and once again, a new DVD shall be coming this way around Christmas.This movie is good. On the night before Halloween D.J. (Hannah Montana's Mitchell Musso) loses his friends basketball. He goes over to get it and causes mean old Mr. Nebblecracker (Steve Buscemi) to come outside and yell at him. All of a sudden, he collapses and D.J. believes he is dead. Then comes babysitter from hell Zee (Maggie Gyllenhall). That night the house comes alive and eats Zee's drunken boyfriend (Jason Lee). D.J. and his friend know something weird is going on and get Jenny (Phil of the Future's Spencer Locke) to help. Eventually, they find out Nebbercracker is not dead and he helps them destroy the house.This movie could be creepy for little kids. I knew the Nebbercracker collapse was coming because of Wikkipedia. The story of Nebbercracker's wife being buried alive in cement was spooky.I liked this movie, but unfortunately, all the people who got eaten came back to life after the house was destroyed. If you ask me, those cops and Bones deserved to be eaten by that house."
225,Monster House,10,26 July 2006,Great Movie,"You never know with some kids movies but I have to say that Monster House was really cool. I enjoyed it very much. It is cool. The house can eat people and all that and it is like a really big adventure of the summer. Nacho Libre loses to this movie. This has to be the best children's adventure movie of the summer of 2006.This movie has a lot of known people. Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Jon Heder, Jason Lee, Kevin James, and Nick Canon. Plus the talents of the children. I have to say Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg working on something together brings you a wonderful adventure.I wonder what it would have been like if Tim Burton helped?"
226,Monster House,9,25 July 2006,That's a house with severe behavior problems!,"There was a time when walking into a cartoon usually meant a satisfying great time because of the amount of work and care that went into producing a genre that most people tend to undervalue or think is not as worthy of attention as serious dramatic movie-making. I can think of ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Shrek"" as perfect examples of animated features that should have at least been nominated for best films. ""Monster House"" is on that level of quality. It has an amazing storyline, with terrific special effects that deserve to be seen in both normal and 3D projection, and the talented cast does a terrific job bringing to life some of the most hilarious characters and lines in recent history.The story is simple. Our heroes sense something is wrong with one of the properties in the neighborhood, eventually they have to confront the ""evil"" in the house, destroy its source, and save a few people along the way. It's apparently, not a completely original concept, but then you start looking at its execution, and things can hardly get any better. The portrayal of the children is fresh and sharp. There is none of the gravitas recent releases have been saddled with. Here people do have chips on their shoulders, but they also know that sitting idle is not going to solve the problems. It is also very exciting to have a real problematic villain that is not so easy to get rid of, and with the help of talented artists, some of the scenes in and around the house are truly a lot of fun, with some unexpected jolts every so often. There are genuine surprises and twists, and digital animation is improving so much that it dazzles, especially in the segments when you know 3D is probably fully enhance the camera angle, but one can also notice that is not gratuitous and obvious, as in the recent release involving a hero and another type of real estate problem.I went in unaware of the very talented vocal casting. Steven Buscemi, Kathleen Turner, Maggie Gyllenthal, Jason Lee, and more. These performers are truly gifted at conveying the emotions of their respective characters, delighting us as we hear conversations that are not stilted but true reflections of what happens between two seemingly different, yet alike characters, like Zee and D.J. There is true dramatic tension, and much comic relief is provided as well. There is no room for padding, only for real dynamic and crackling lines, such as the one given by Zee to D.J., as she tries to make sense of his new rather erratic condition.Bring yourself and your children to this film. It's truly a treat, a hilarious, creepy, creative, and fun ride... something that I'm glad to report is back in Hollywood!"
227,Monster House,8,25 July 2006,Surprisingly good movie!,"I was quite surprised by this movie, in a good way. I'm so used to animated movies being comedies, I had assumed Mosnter House would be the same as Shrek, et al. But it wasn't really a comedy at all - it was basically a tween-ager-friendly animated horror movie. It reminded me of a sort of animated version of 'Poltergeist' (although the stories are different.) 'Poltergeist' wasn't a hard-core horror movie, and so was more open to a slightly younger audience. Monster House is similar in that way (and, being animated, even more open to younger audiences.) My 8-year-old son (and his 8-year-old friend) both loved it.My family liked 'Cars', but Monster House was refreshingly different.Definitely recommended."
228,Monster House,9,25 July 2006,Stephen King meets Rod Serling for the Nick and Disney Set,"This is a very enjoyable film. The story was like a Stephen King or Rod Serling tale, that wasn't dumbed down for the kids, which most movies do.The frights were appropriate and sometimes downright intense, even for adults. However, not too much for my six, eight, ten and twelve year olds who also loved it.The voice casting was excellent and the motion capture animation worked very well -- none of the unintentional creepiness of Polar Express.The scripting was very effective -- including homages to the genre and to the producer Zemekis.When this is released on video/DVD, I will purchase it and watch it many times."
229,Monster House,8,24 July 2006,Surprisingly good movie (only tiny spoiler),"I went to see this movie with medium expectations. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. There were many sections that seemed to be aimed at the adults rather than the kids. However, there were also sections where the kids laughed and clapped enthusiastically (mostly in response to the chowder character's toilet humor).The problems I had with the movie were the slow beginning, and the inconsistency of the age-based attributes of the little girl on the tricycle. (1)While riding the tricycle, she appeared a consistent 3-4 years old (more likely 4). However, as soon as she opened her mouth, it revealed that she was missing her 2 front teeth. This occurs at 6 years old. I realize this is a very minor nit-pick to most people, but it really irritated me. Fortunately, the movie was good enough to overcome my negativism. I was very glad I stayed to see the rest of the movie. Next time I go, I will just ignore the little girl."
230,Monster House,7,24 July 2006,This Old House Meets the Goonies,"Highly enjoyable, tame animated film about three young teens delving into the secrets and villainy of the deserted, forlorn, rickety house across the street - a house which, along with its owner, has stood for meanness, terrifying youths for decades as it swallows the toys and belongings of children who played too near its borders. The animation process used in this film is simply marvelous as we get what is in effect a two-dimensional figure looking like a three-dimensional figure most of the time. The process looks very real in some scenes even. The animation brings to life the three young leads, as does a script which is not breathtaking or poignant but on target with the characters being presented. And while much of the script is pretty vacuous and predictable, the story DOES have heart and a neat twist as to why the house is evil and terrifying all the children in the neighborhood. The voices used in the film greatly enhance the characterizations of the three juvenile leads: Mitchell Musso as D. J. is understated and commanding, Spencer Locke is very good as Jenny, and much of the humor comes from Sam Lerner as Chowder. The additional voices are a who's who's of famous people: Jason Lee, Steve Buscemi, Kathleen Turner, Fred Willard, John Heder(a funny ""role""), Maggie Gyllenhaal, and an unmistakable Kevin James as a policeman. Director Gil Kenan does a good job keeping the pace tight. This movie is really quite innocuous. I hear some people say that children under ten shouldn't see this. HOGWASH! There is almost nothing remotely offensive in this film with regards to language, situations, or violence. Sure, there are some made-to-be-scary moments, but nothing strong at all. Just enough to get your adrenaline up. There are some commercials on TV that are far scarier(Right now those Geico ones with the celebrities are giving me the chills.) Take the kids to see this and enjoy. My only comment - not really a criticism - is why did Amblin bring this out during the summer rather than at Halloween. It would have made a great Halloween film."
231,Monster House,7,24 July 2006,Good But Age Group Is Wrong!,I Had The Opportunity To Try And Watch This Film With My Sisters Who Are Aged 9 And 13 And Both Of Them Didn't Want To Watch It All The Way Through They Said It Was To Scary Which Says Something About The Rating That Has Been Given To This Film I Don't Think It Should Be For That Sort Of Age Group I Think It Can Be To Scary For Some Kids Aged Upto 12 And 13 Who Are Not Used To This Type Of Film But I Guess That Depends On The Individual Watching It. However I Did Sit Down And Watch The Film Myself And I Found It To Be A Good Film And Quite Funny But I Think Some Of The Scenes And Lines In The Film Shouldn't Be Heard By Kids Of That Age Group.
232,Monster House,8,23 July 2006,a monstrous joy able ride,"A good tale of horror and humor. Three kids discover that a house across the street is cursed, because anybody gets too near it seem to disappear. When adults don't believe them, or they think they're paranoid. The kids go to a expert on super natural things, and tells the kids that they must go inside and discover where the heart is inside the house, in hopes it will put an end to the evil forever. So the kids decide to do that, but will they destroy the house if it doesn't destroy them first? The best animation since Polar Express, it should have been released during Halloween time. But still a good movie. But not as good as Polar Express."
233,Monster House,8,20 July 2006,Good but... what's the deal?,"I enjoyed Monster House throughly... it was a lot better than I expected it to be.. in fact during parts I thought I was watching something Burton...howeverI felt that the situation was so isolated you know... I felt that the neighborhood should have been a part of the reaction...it was much better than Cars and Over the Hedge and The Wild all the other crap they put out this summeroh and another thing...I'm feeling that these days EVERYTHING that is put out is set up for a sequel... it's either a cliff hanger or you leave with so many things unanswered and in my opinion that's sloppy and unfulfilling- not clever or allusive... not at all... so with Bones emerging from the pit of the house and then being dismissed by the baby sitter I was just like ""great"" next summer they are gonna be looking for more of our money... but the main thing is- what is the deal with the limiting of characters and why do you feel like no one notices except DJ and Chowderthank you"
