0,Uncle,9,8 July 2014,"Excellent short done by Adam Elliot, part of a trilogy.","This is a short from Adam Elliot, best known for Harvie Krumpet. There will be spoilers ahead:Adam Elliot did a trilogy of shorts about his family, Uncle being the first one. By turns touching and humorous, his uncle's life is told with clear and genuine affection, even when discussing the tragedies. Uncle is an eccentric type, given to twisting pipe cleaners into spiders and fussing over crumpets and his pet chihuahua Reg.His uncle's later life isn't an easy one and the tragedies are recounted in the same deadpan narrative style as are the comical bits. This can lend an air of cruelty to the material even when such is clearly not the intention of the author. His uncle ultimately winds up in an old-age home when it becomes clear he can no longer manage on his own. The short is funny and sad, but rewarding in the final analysis.This short is available on DVD, both the Harvie Krumpet DVD and as part of The Animation Show, Volume 1 and is most recommended."
1,Uncle,10,6 March 2006,Love soaked and funny,"With a great bit of animation, great writing, and a wonderful narrator, This comes out to be a beautiful piece overall. The gentle pacing and cartoony but flattering character designs allowed this piece much gravitas. At first I questioned whether or not the short should have been in ""The Animation Show"" but it's writing and fluid stop-motion animation alone carried it well.Personally I have nothing more to say about this piece and to expect me to be anything but excited to write about this great piece is just plain word greedy.If only my family in Austrailia could be this interesting.The Lazy Southerner"
2,Uncle,4,29 July 2016,Elliot's first,"""Uncle"" is a black-and-white animated short film from Australia. The writer and director here is Adam Elliot and he made this one back in 1996, which means it has its 20th anniversary this year. Elliot received a nice deal of awards attention for it and so he went on making films about other male family members afterward before finally moving to his Oscar-winning short film ""Harvie Krumpet"". Comparing this one here to the latter shows that he had a long way to go still. I personally did not really enjoy this 6-minute film I have to admit. It was too dark and depressing (especially with what happened to his aunt) and the story-telling just is not good enough to make it touching really. Also, it was neither funny nor entertaining. I will check out Elliot's follow-up films soon and I hope these are better. The narration did not really impress me either. As for ""Uncle"", I don't recommend the watch."
3,Uncle,8,5 January 2008,Very strange but very endearing,"This is one of three odd little films made by Adam Benjamin Elliot. The trilogy consists of UNCLE, COUSIN and BROTHER. All three are very similar in style--all with similar claymation, all in black and white and all with very deadpan narration. All three films also are quite funny and very poignant.UNCLE is about the narrator's uncle, though I have no idea if these remembrances are true or not. Whatever the case may be, the claymation and way of doing the film make it very funny indeed and you can't help but be pulled into the world of the creator. However, while most of it is rather funny, like the other two films, the ending is rather sad and poignant.Now the claymation quality is just okay, but because the film captivates the viewer so quickly and I found after I saw one I was strongly compelled to seek out the others, then this was a very effective film. One well worth seeing--particularly for lovers of shorts and animation.If you want to see this or the other two videos, go to http://www.atomfilms.com/ ."
4,Uncle,7,26 October 2006,Family,"Adam Elliot's first in a sort of trilogy of family shorts done in the same gray, warm style tells the story of his uncle's life with the same sort of humor and care that he later consummated with Brother. This story shows his uncle's life and decisions after his wife died, and how he tries to hide from the family how lonely he is.It's not crafted different from Brother and Cousin, which means anyone who likes one of them will probably like the others. I really like Uncle, it reminds me of the type of stories people used to tell when sitting in the living room after a funeral, where they're not necessarily depressed but warmly grieving a lost loved one. Adam Elliot's little family trilogy is one of the most heart-felt animation I've ever seen, and it almost makes a lot of other cinema seem flippant and unimportant to what can be done when one really cares.--PolarisDiB"
5,Uncle,5,25 August 2008,Many Dark Tales In This Particular Family Portrait,"Having first seen the other two films in this three-part narration about the writer's strange family, I was disappointed with this one. The writer and director is Adam Elliot.The other two ""Brother"" and ""Cousin"" had humor and tragedy, but more on the humor and lighter side. They may you feel good watching them. This one is much, much darker with little humor, and was depressing. It's almost mean-spirited in its portrayal of old people, which is what his Uncle represents for much of this animated short.""Uncle"" works at his hardware shop. The first time our narrator saw him, he was cleaning his pipe his pipe cleaners and make one into a shape of a spider, and gave it to the young boy. He was impressed. He retired after selling his 1,000,000th nail. All of that is light and fun to hear and see....but after that, we hear about his wife who drinks poison and kills herself. The uncle is showing with his butt half out, peeing on his plants, inviting ""religious"" people to his house (always a bad thing in the world of films), crushing snails with a brick, having his dog run over and killed, acting senile and then going into a home, etc. etc. The claymation was excellent, as always, but it didn't make up for the too-unpleasant story."
