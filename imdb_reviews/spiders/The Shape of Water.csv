0,The Shape of Water,2,1 January 2018,"Guillermo Del Toro does ""Amelie"" meets ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""","Diabetics beware, you're in for a saccharine flavoured heap of mush.The Shape of Water was directed/created by Guillermo Del Toro best known for creepy and violent films such as Pan's Labyrinth and more mainstream writings such as Hellboy and The Hobbit. For some reason he has had a dose of the lovestrucks and written a film that is basically Amelie meets Creature from the Black Lagoon. There are a couple of questionable violent scenes (torturing a dying man by dragging him around via a bullet wound to the cheek had a touch of the old GDT that we know and love) but the plot literally has no surprises whatsoever. I picked the minor twist about 10 minutes in, and spent the second half of the film waiting for it to be over. I am sorry to say the only interesting part was the reveal (not literally) of the sea creature's penis via the main character's description which is frankly hilarious. Octavia Spencer does a fantastic job of playing herself (Was this woman born middle aged?) but let's face it we love her anyway. I would love her to be my best friend, she's a hoot.Michael Shannon (whom I remember from Take Shelter and Boardwalk Empire) plays a creepy bad guy in a way that makes me never want to have him around for Christmas lunch. Why does he always play someone sexually awkward? I pray we'll never find out. I was most disappointed that unlike Pan's Labyrinth and some of the other films GDT has made it's not set in a fantastical different world. It's basically the 1950s cold war era in USA with no real pretense of being anything but. I was hoping for a magical realism, but other than the creature, there's no otherworldliness to it. I am a solid romantic, but I found the plot so saccharine that it made me feel nauseous. There is also a sudden musical number that almost had me running for the aisle, and my sister desperate to see my husband's face (He's allergic to musicals generally). Apart from this light relief, I couldn't wait to get out of there.I am pretty alone in this opinion, our party was split between 3 people who loved it, and my husband and I who hated it. Maybe if I hadn't seen other GDT films I would have liked it more. My husband also thought the trailer completely misrepresented what he expected from the film. So maybe we were in the wrong movie. But I think romance lovers won't like the art house element, and art house/GDT fans won't like this film. So I think commercially it will be hard to place."
1,The Shape of Water,1,2 January 2018,So disappointing.,"I was taught before criticism that you should first bring up the good points. Good points: Cinematography, good actors, great old movie clips and music, great sets, good costumes, and an extremely promising storyline. Unfortunately, this movie missed, when it really could have, and SHOULD have, hit. 
I think from now on I'll choose my movies based upon how they're doing at the box office, and not based on reviews. It seems to be a better indicator of what the public REALLY thinks about a film. 
We're at week 3 and (for such a seemingly magnificent film), The Shape of Water hasn't even broken even. A telling clue. Budget:$19,400,000 (estimated)
Opening Weekend USA: $166,564, 3 December 2017, Limited Release
Gross USA: $12,140,155, 28 December 2017Personally, I found it contrived, unbelievable, and just plain stupid. Where to start? 
A cookie cutter ""Beauty and the Beast"" love story with too many holes. I never caught on to the burgeoning romance. Somehow it just fell flat for me. It was already a mediocre movie when they did that ridiculous black & white dance sequence, which was so far out of place, I lost all interest. The music and old film clips were great, but what were they thinking? Were they trying to cash in on some La La Land success? Or was it supposed be some allusion to Cinderella's ball? It would have made more sense as a dream sequence either where Hawkins had dozed off during a flick, or in the bathtub. 
Ew. Were the masturbation scenes really necessary? I can't see where they drove the plot. 
Are we supposed to believe a creature like that could or would run into a theatre, leaving a blood trail no less, without being seen by ANYONE? Then he just stands watching a film. (All the while knowing he was in danger from humans and he needed to get to water)? All this, and the projectionist doesn't notice? Where are the film patrons? How'd he get IN without being noticed by anyone? An unlocked door? What would be the purpose of having a box office if you're going to leave an access door unlocked? 
Are we supposed to believe that the creature, being so sick and weak that he must be released immediately, suddenly has superhuman strength after some strange (and inexplicable) resurrection event following his ""death""? 
And are we supposed to believe that you could pull a full grown man via a bullet hole in his cheek? (You'd rip right through.)
Are we supposed to believe that the best friend wouldn't have freaked out about the coitus? In her eyes, wasn't it more an animal. At the very least, one would expect her to broach the subject of pregnancy. 
How did those two remain standing in the bathroom? The force of the water would have carried them out. If it was pressing that much on the door, the window should have blown. 
Why didn't Richard Jenkins appear to grieve at all regarding his cat?
And why? Oh WHY? Couldn't they just release him directly into the ocean immediately, rather than wait for the locks to fill. I mean the water was RIGHT THERE. They could have made a bath in the back of the van, and just got him to the coast. 
On and on I could go, but I'm done with my rant. Save your money. If you want dumbed down fantasy get the Hallmark channel. At least you know you're getting purely pleasant drivel, instead of wasting your money and being grossly disappointed."
2,The Shape of Water,1,28 December 2017,2 hours of my life I will never get back.,"I really don't understand the hype for this movie. I know del Toro makes some odd movies, but I did like Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage, so I went into this one without reading any reviews or knowing much about it but expecting something decent as a way to spend 2 hours of my life. Wrong!
-The dialogue in this movie is just choppy and facetious. The most cringeworthy conversation to me was between Hoyt and the ugly bad dude. Fragmented threats like ""I will take you out of this universe"" just don't do it for me. Absolutely illogical and nonsensical script. It seems like they said every line in the movie thinking that it was deep and had an impact and was super important... but nothing was really needed for this movie. It could've been filmed without speaking at all and the stupid story still would have come across.
-I just didn't feel the relationship/love between the annoyingly mousy lead lady and the fish dude. She got on my damn nerves, really. So she brought the semi-sentient creature some boiled eggs that she made while she fapped in her bathtub (awkward and unnecessary). And meanwhile the entire f*cking building is on camera, but they never see her repeatedly sneaking in his sealed off room to feed him and even play music and dance for him?!?! serious cringe-fest right there. 
-the black lady Zelda ran her mouth all the time but yet everyone stepped all over her, including the lead (Sally I think? I'm trying hard to forget this stupid movie). Couldn't she ever tell Zelda a simple ""thank you"" for all the millions of times Zelda stepped up for her, made sure she ate, translated for her, punched her time card for her, lied for her, etc? Not once did Sally show gratitude. It's like Sally is a weird, selfish person that became infatuated with a dude that looks like Thane from Mass Effect 2 (yet Thane was 1,000 times more of a fleshed out character than this ""god fish"") and everyone just helped the anorexic mouse lady because she ""found true love."" No one thought this was f*cking weird?? She meets a semi-intelligent FISH in a lab tank and bangs him and has a sick puppy love for him and everyone in the movie acted like that was completely normal. Seriously? In what world is bestiality normal? Just completely idiotic.
-Soooo many unnecessary and useless scenes. Who cares about the mean dude (Michael Shannon) not liking noise and furiously banging his weird Stepford Wife missionary style while he covers her mouth and continually tells her to shut up? And when he got his new Cadillac car with the weird salesman and all the useless banter about its color being ""teal"" not ""green?"" Or the scene with Sally furiously water-fapping while she makes boiled eggs for the weird fish dude? or where M Shannon pees in front of the 2 ladies without holding his d*ck? 
I could go on and on forever and rip this movie to shreds, but I'm already annoyed and tired from writing all this. This movie was completely and utterly stupid, and I wish I could have my time and money back. Fail, del Toro. Big stupid fail. Ugh."
3,The Shape of Water,3,18 December 2017,Bloody Weird,"G. Del Toro has been frequently fawned over as a 'masterful story teller'. I found nothing 'masterful' about it. I absolutely could not hook in to this film. It made no logistical sense at all. It also had a dark and cartoonish feel to it like a Bat Man film. The setting in which the story takes place is deeply flawed. Eliza (the dumb one), and Zelda (Octavia Spencer) work as cleaning ladies in a so-called top secret facility when there seems to be nothing top-secret about it.The cleaning pair wander at will throughout the facility and discover it's also 'top-secret' biological specimen with no clearance at all. Right.And low and behold, the biological specimen is none other than the Creature from the Black Lagoon! This time in living color and many upgrades.One might also notice Octavia Spencer is appearing in every other bomb out of Hollywood as a supporting actress and nothing more. Maybe in ten years they'll give her one of her own movies. Not holding my breath.Back to the Creature. We'll call him Creatch for short. The homely Eliza has a strict routine of hard boiling eggs while she masturbates furiously in her bathtub every morning. Eliza is fundamentally scared to death of normal men. She then brings the food to Creach, which she eventually falls in love with.Creach is super duper intelligent and can instantly learn English, American sign language and writing, but likes to savagely dine on the occasional domesticated cat here and there. Right.Creach also has super powers. He can almost instantly heal bodily wounds, as well as restore hair to a bald man. Alright, that one small bit I found pretty cool, but that's it. Eliza eventually decides to kidnap Creach, for his own good, so she can turn him loose into the ocean just one step ahead of Russian Agents who have infiltrated the facility for the soul purpose of killing him. Again, not a very top-secret organization.Shortly after that, Eliza and Creach begin having sex. That's right. An otherwise normal woman gets it on with a humanoid looking fish that looks like it dried out in the oven too long. Happens all the time I guess.The two subplots involving a sadistic head of security and an alcoholic neighbor who works as a graphics artist are barely even worth mentioning.And the ending? Beyond impossible.This story is strictly reserved for the over-emotional, over-romantic, and completely naïve.Go see it if you really want to, but you have been warned."
4,The Shape of Water,3,22 December 2017,The Sad Shape of Moviemaking,"While the basic premise of this King Kong-ish plot, the lead acting (with the exception of the stereotypical and WAY overplayed villain), and the recreation of the 60's time period are all somewhat worthy (three stars worth), there are many oddly-forced and clunky scenes all of which impede the storytelling flow and represent a serious distraction: Gratuitous gore (rotting fingers, headless kitty), homosexual innuendo, masturbation, a bathroom that will hold 7 feet of water by simply closing the door and putting a towel under it, inter-species love at first sight sexual attraction and off-screen consummation, and a Saturday-Night-Live-like song and dance skit (?), among several others. Even with the love-conquers-all 'happy ending' and a beautifully depicted submerged in water embrace final scene,' overall it doesn't digest well.P.S. The shill-like adoration of just the titles alone (!) of most of the 10/10 user ratings for this film are absurdly hilarious, their effusively giddy text even more so."
5,The Shape of Water,8,5 December 2017,A Delightful Fairy Tale From Del Toro,"Guillermo del Toro is back with this visually stunning and thoroughly entertaining adult fairy tale. While this movie does not quite live up to some of his previous films (i.e. ""Pan's Labyrinth,"") it is still a great film in its own right. When one begins to watch the film, the first thing that the viewer will notice is the luscious and stunning visuals. These aesthetic qualities are all the more superb and stunning when one takes a moment to realize that they were done with practical effects rather than CGI. As usual, the visionary style del Toro takes to envision his creature and sets is incredibly impressive. Alexandre Desplat's score, with its simplistic, unpretentious and almost low-key charm, is also thoroughly riveting.The plot, which centers on a janitor's relationship with a creature kept in a research lab during the Cold War era in Baltimore, is entertaining throughout. The film is paced well, and never drags or feels tedious. The acting on display in the film is good as well, with a solid performance from Sally Hawkins in the lead role, a show-stealing supporting performance by Octavia Spencer, and a darkly powerful turn by Michael Shannon as a supervisor who serves as the film's sadistic villain. It is also important to note how the film is enhanced by its use of classic filmmaking tropes, which are managed well as to feel original rather than clichéd or too old-fashioned. They give the film a unique layer of depth to it that helps work hand-in-hand with its stylish aesthetic and unique mix of charm and darker themes. The only criticism I have of this film is the fact that there is a lack of individualization or characterization of film's supporting characters; these characters seem solely memorable based on a single personality trait. Otherwise, this is a skillfully made fantasy film and one that I would recommend very much. 8.5/10"
6,The Shape of Water,2,14 October 2017,Disappointing Twaddle,"This has absolutely so much going for it - beautifully filmed, with a magnificent, sweeping score and a stunning performance from Sally Hawkins - but crashes and burns in sentiment, cliché and cartoon supporting acts. It comes across, ultimately, as a cack-handed mash up of ""E.T."", ""Splash"" and ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"", as an aquatic man is captured and brought into a secret military American laboratory in the 1960s at the height of the cold war, and Sally Hawkins' mute cleaner develops a bond with it and, ultimately, falls in love.Sounds interesting, doesn't it? It certainly has potential, but if the sassy black friend, constantly yammering on about her feckless husband (Octavia Spencer, surely tiring of this kind of role) doesn't get you, or the inefficient gay neighbour/best friend (Richard Jenkins - not his finest two hours) or Michael Shannon's cartoonish, 2D villain, then stay tuned for the ghastly black-and-white fantasy dance number, in which Hawkins and the creature cavort on an elaborate set like Astaire and Rogers. It truly is a ghastly mis-step, jaw-droppingly stupid. The film never really recovered for me, and it lumbered to its predictable climax and ending with numbing melodramatics and sentiment."
7,The Shape of Water,9,24 December 2017,Real love under unreal circumstances.,"To communicate or not to communicate. Sometimes is just out of fear that we don't come close to the ones who can give us exactly what we need. They're different, let's stay away. Sally Hawkins in a magical but beautifully real performance invites us to try, to dare. Guillermo del Toro takes us through the paces with extraordinary delicacy and clarity of vision. Thank you."
8,The Shape of Water,3,1 January 2018,Liberal do-gooders save amphibian humanoid from stereotyped right-wing martinets in this vastly overrated tale set in Cold War era,"The Shape of Water is noted director Guillermo del Toro's vastly overrated attempt to link mythic fantasy to the Cold War era. The problem with the film is its absurd premise: there's a secret government facility in Baltimore which houses an amphibian humanoid captured earlier in the Amazon by bad guy Colonel Richard Strickland (a cartoon, right wing martinet adventurer) played by an over the top Michael Shannon.Even if one accepts the premise (which I of course do not), you would think that security would be tight at the facility to ensure no unauthorized persons have access to the creature. Quite conveniently, however, the film's protagonist, the mute cleaning lady, Elisa (who communicates via sign language), is permitted to perform her cleaning duties inside the room where the newly minted ""creature from the black lagoon"" is imprisoned and easily ends up bonding with him (or it-which ever appellation you prefer!). Elisa soon hatches a plan to save the creature from the dastardly clutches of Strickland, and Strickland's sponsor, another vile right wing martinet, General Frank Hoyt. Of course the more than noble Elisa is joined by friends and confederates, all again quite conveniently joined at the hip by distinct, commonly held LIBERAL convictions. These associates include Elisa's best friend Zelda, played by Octavia Spencer in the familiar role as African-American ""help"" (will she ever be cast as the ""bad guy"" in any future films?), Giles, Elisa's neighbor, an artist and closeted gay, and a sympathetic scientist Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, who is actually a Soviet spy (note that Hoffstetler's superiors, are very much Strickland's counterparts, as they also evince a most unpleasant demeanor).Elisa somehow ends up ferreting the creature out of the facility after she learns of Strickland's deadline to vivisect it, allegedly for scientific purposes. Back at her apartment, she keeps the creature alive in a tub filled with salt water. Once the river is at full tide, the plan is to remove the creature from the apartment and bring it to safety, in the watery refuge.Meanwhile, the creature's dark side becomes slightly manifest when it attempts to take a bite out of a house cat (animal lovers do not despair: the creature is unsuccessful in significantly injuring the little kitty!). Giles is more than happy after it becomes apparent the creature has healing powers, touching Giles on his bald pate, and inducing some hair growth. And Elisa experiences pure bliss after discovering that the creature's genitalia is actually hidden and with a little coaxing, can actually engage in sexual intercourse (the act actually takes place in Elisa's bathroom, now completely flooded to the ceiling).Strickland, about to be fired by General Hoyt following the creature's disappearance, remains frustrated by not being able to find the lost amphibian (you would have thought that maybe he could have figured it out earlier that Elisa was the number one suspect). Strickland finally finds out from Zelda's terrified husband after unmercifully browbeating him, that Elisa is indeed the culprit who has sprung the creature from Strickland's deadly lair.No need to describe the rest of the plot in detail. Suffice it to say, there is a confrontation with Strickland who shoots both our heroes, only to meet his own demise at the hands of the creature, who miraculously recovers from Strickland's bullet to the gut. Elisa also revives (despite her wounds) and joins the creature in a blissful embrace underwater. How is this accomplished? Well, it seems Del Toro has kept his clues about Elisa's true nature from us all along. She's also some kind of long lost creature, and the wounds on the side of her neck, are actually gills-so she experiences some kind of re-awakening, again most conveniently while embracing her new found ""king.""I actually have a friend who sees the denouement as some kind of Gnostic allegory. Of course anyone can read into this narrative, anything they want. But the fantasy element certainly seems way out of place with this Cold War tale which also has problems of its own, with its rather cheap triumph of liberal do-goodism over stereotypical right-wing demagoguery."
9,The Shape of Water,9,14 January 2018,Romantic Dark Fantasy,"In Baltimore, in the early 60´s, the lonely and mute Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is the janitor of a secret government laboratory where she works in the night-shift with her friend Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer). She lives in an old apartment above a movie-theater and she usually watches television with her other friend, her next-door neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins), who is a gay artist. When a creature captured in a South-American river and brought to the laboratory, Elisa feels curiosity and learns that he is an Amphibian Man (Doug Jones). She secretly feds him every night with egg and listens to music in his room, and they become close to each other. However the security agent Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) is bitten by the creature and loses two fingers. He meets General Hoyt (Nick Searcy) and convinces him to eliminate the creature. When Elisa discovers, she decides to rescue the Amphibian Man and release him in the sea. The scientist Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg), who is a Russian agent, decides to help her. ""The Shape of Water"" is a romantic dark fantasy film by Guillermo del Toro with a beautiful and bizarre love story. Elisa is a sort of the Beauty and the Amphibious Man would be the Beast in this mature film. The cinematography is amazing in an environment of the early 60´s in Baltimore. The performances are top-notch and the soundtrack is top-notch. ""The Shape of Water"" was awarded with the Golden Lion in the Venice Festival and many awards in the Golden Globe. It was also considered one of the top ten movies of 2017 by the American Film Institute. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""A Forma da Água"" (""The Shape of the Water"")"
10,The Shape of Water,3,31 December 2017,Could have been a good movie.,"Guillermo del Toro is an excellent filmmaker. The premises of this movie are commendable but the implementation is plain horrible. We all have been told that our society is extremely divided today and if one of the sides wins then the end of the world will come. But I wonder since when has it become a crime to have different opinions?
The main premise behind the movie is that it is okay to be different and I am sure we all agree with that. The problem is that according to the movie if one differs from the ""different"" than it is a crime.
The world is simply black and white and there is nothing in the middle. The bad guys are racist, sadistic, and homophobic. The good guys are emotional, creative, and acceptable."
11,The Shape of Water,10,11 November 2017,Guillermo Del Toro's Best Film So Far !,"Guillermo Del Toro's newest film ""The Shape of Water"" took my breath away. Easily this is Del Toro's finest film since ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and may even be his best in general. This is a film where Del Toro weaves magic throughout with a story he created which is simple, yet layered with such interesting facets embedded in each character, set, and prop as he allows the audience to discover this intimate and fascinating world of ""broken"" people searching for a moment of meaning. Captivating from its opening scenes with haunting visual imagery, and a lyrical score by Alexandre Desplat, one is immediately enthralled by this fairy tale that is not your usual saccharine variety that Disney cranks out.Del Toro knows how to tell a story with wit, style and heart. Assembling a cast headed by the incandescent Sally Hawkins in the role of Eliza who is mute throughout the film, but exudes such humanity and strength along with the villainous Michael Shannon who provides a great balance. Every single actor sparkles because every character has been developed with great care. Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer shine in their roles bringing a touch of quirkiness and humor to this sometimes dark story.The film is achingly nostalgic with glorious production design by Paul D. Austerberry evoking the Baltimore of 1962 full of fascinating textures of faded glory, especially in the magnificent design of Eliza's apartment and hallways. Exquisite camera work by Dan Laustsen and beautifully designed costumes by Luis Sequiera contribute greatly to complete Guillermo Del Toro's vision.This film is really the ultimate version of ""Beauty and The Beast"" with a touch of ""ET"", capped off with a very emotional investment, that pays off for the audience in its poetic and lyrical final scene. Certainly one of the finest films of 2017."
12,The Shape of Water,10,13 October 2017,"Del Toro's new moving, thrilling romantic fantasy","If I was to tell you about Guillermo Del Toro's new film what would I say.As the father of dark fantasy, Guillermo Del Toro knows how to bring alive the illusive wonderlands and nightmares we can relish and transform them into wonderful poignant crafts of insight and meaning, and The Shape of Water is no exception. With its journey from Venice to Toronto, The Shape of Water has now hit the London Film Festival, now within reach of this exuberant critic. I had only the budget to see one film at this year's festival and I most certainly made a wise decision.During the Cold War conflict of the 60s, a mute but hearing Eliza (Sally Hawkins) works as a cleaner at a secret government facility, where she becomes drawn to the new specimen: a mysterious marine creature (Doug Jones). While Eliza begins to fall in love with it, the facility head Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), only desires to take the creature apart for experimental advantage against the Russians. Eliza's bond with the creature soon begins to effect those around her: her neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins), work college Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and scientist Robert Hoffsteder (Michael Stuhbarg) What is amazing profound about Del Toro's latest work is its eccentric visualisation in reflection of the political and social conceptions of the past , but also today. The most centralised end is the the treatment of those who are different. Directly dealing with the fantasy of other species but intertwined with racial treatment relevant to the time in which the film is set, and then of course against the back drop of the national conflicts, but then also the value of those with deficiencies, as portrayed by Sally Hawkins.More distant from his darker tones in, Pan's Labyrinth, and Crimson Peak, but not far from the surreal fantasy, The Shape of Water becomes more grounded than previous Del Toro films, and diversely more lighter and funnier. With frequent laughs and jokes on screen, the romantic fantasy is a much light hearted watch, of course not without its moment of bloody violence but at a lower volume. What may be hard for some audiences to get their head around, is this idea of an inter-species relations and with the astonishing design of the creature itself becomes something more than just a fish costume. The bond and sexuality of this romance is a significant thread to the film and is one that featured heavily with its repetitive moments of adult content. But what Del Toro explores its is real beauty in love and within the context of the film it does becomes something remarkable.Sally Hawkins is exceptional in her vigorous performance as the mute Eliza, with dynamic sign language and spirited facial expressions, we see the isolated heart of the ""princess without voice"" which makes her connection to this solitary creature all the more real. Opposite her is the confident physical actor Doug Jones, manning the rubber suit of the creature in a brilliant bodily performance, outdoing his previous collaborative performances with Del Toro. Then Michael Shannon sensationally brings the real monster to the tale in Strickland, the dominating Colonel facing his battle in masculinity as well as with the creature. Shannon gives one of the best performances of his career, keeping with that classic fairy tale juxtaposition of man being the real monster.As with all Del Toro's dark fantasies, it all becomes about the characters. Eliza reaching out to another like herself. Strickland trying to maintain his power and masculinity in his skirmish with the creature and Eliza. Hoffsetider being caught between to sides but seeking his own right, and Giles trying to find his significance back in society.As never fails with a Del Toro films is the signature production design that brings to life these magnificent worlds. The Shape of Water although is not full Del Tory fairy tale land, does have a very extraordinary construct of the real world, from Eliza's apartment to the secret facility, echoing the true Gothic universe of the real world. Opening in a momentous title sequence, Del Toro literally floods the screen in ravishing visual effects and segments. Only more so combined with the inescapable talents of cinematographer: Dan Laustsen, swiftly moving from one room to the next in a mythical immersive experience alluring us furthermore into the depths of the story and art work of the film.The Shape of Water is a wonderfully weird, quirky, heart-warming, extraordinary piece of cinema. For fans who have found Del Toro's previous works too dark or scary, will be delighted by this much more charming fantasy."
13,The Shape of Water,2,24 December 2017,"Duck, Magnum, Duck!","If the heroine could speak, she may only muster a ""Duck, Magnum, Duck"" - with her weak, scared, and fragile feminine character written by someone clearly unaware of how powerful women actually are. I spent 1/2 of this movie incredibly agitated at how scared and weak Zelda is. Scared to do this, scared to do that. It was exhausting. I partially blame actor Sally Hawking - didn't she have a voice and an opportunity to say ""look. I starved myself for this character. I look underweight and malnourished and just am so sheepish and frightened all the time. Any woman who has been thru abuse like Zelda had would theoretically come back strong and eat a sandwich."" But no, she took the role and caved in to the ridiculousness. She couldn't have been more than 80 lbs in this movie, and gladly bared all, bones and all."" I walked out. 2 stars for creative effort. Time to grow up, Hollywood. Real women eat sandwiches."
14,The Shape of Water,5,4 January 2018,Nope - Sorry,"It was a sweet story and the compassion and love was beautiful until the inter-species sex scene. It's not out of being prudish or anything but everyone has a 'line' and mine would be sex between a woman and the creature from the black lagoon.I found the dialogue tediously boring, too. ""Every...sentence...seemed to be something...that...had many...unnecessary...words...that...made it take...a very...long ...time to get...the point across.""I really wanted to love this movie, I will say that I 'liked' it but human and alien getting jiggy with it just blows any sort of 'sweetness' of this love story."
15,The Shape of Water,10,14 October 2017,"Tolerance for All Colors, Creeds, Species and Moviegoers Alike","Every now and then a work of cinema arrives in theaters that completely challenges one's conception of what a film can be. A groundbreaking technical and thematic masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy director Guillermo del Toro accomplishes something that on paper seems impossible; what is essentially a comedic Cold War body horror musical romance between a mute woman and a mermaid. Not only does the modern master of movie monsters blend such an eclectic variety of genres into a single storyline, but he also does so without any sense of convolution or confusion, exhibiting a technical mastery that allows the film to seamlessly flow between its fantastical elements and social realism as well as stand as a work of art on its own. What Del Toro's latest film offers is not merely a stylistic spectacle, but also a thoughtful meditation on the nature of love and its ultimate lack of boundaries.Before directing my appraisals towards the film's exceptional ensemble performances, thematic resonance and technical ingenuity, I feel it necessary to discuss what's on the surface. The film's production design is, simply put, outstanding. Set within the cultural bubble of early 1960s Baltimore, you can tell del Toro feels a genuine love for the aesthetic of the era, between the beauty of the grandiose operatic cinema to the humorously polite manner in which the characters converse with one another. This is contrasted by the grim color palette of the facility that Eliza (Sally Hawkins) and Zelda (Octavia Spencer) work in, a white male-dominated hierarchy in which minorities are abused like slaves. Even outside of the facility, del Toro never shies away from the darkness behind this maintained superficial beauty. Racism, sexism and homophobia are ever present as shop owners reject minorities to preserve their all-white family aesthetic and Col. Strickland (Michael Shannon) exerts his dominance over the wife of his nuclear family in a truly sickening way. However, unlike most period pieces, there is no protest or fight for change. The superficial world remains solid through every horrible injustice committed, for these characters live in the 60s, where there is an understanding (or at least a belief) that things won't change. The characters accept these injustices for it's all they can do, strengthening and almost excusing the central interspecies love story so that it resonates all the more deeply.From a technical perspective, the film truly mimics the element of its title. It's camera-work floats towards and around its characters while its transitions flow into one another like water. Del Toro maintains such a rhythmic pace via his use of editing, usually cutting on sound to craft a film that is as auditory as it is visual. The film's ensemble of is just as stunning. Against the backdrop of the 1960s del Toro's protagonists consist of different social outcasts, placing the authoritative white male in the role of an antagonist who takes full advantage of his societal superiority complex. Octavia Spencer as Zelda (Eliza's black co-worker) and Richard Jenkins as Giles (Eliza's gay neighbor) provide much of the film's comedic relief through their simultaneous embodiment and subversion of the era's stereotypes. While one could argue that their roles of the closeted gay confidante and the black maid are cliché, both characters display a strong awareness for their prejudiced status, with both resolving to disobey the conventions society has imposed on them; a decision that sets them apart from most portrayals of 1960s minorities. Michael Shannon offers another compelling performance as an abusive sociopath, and some of his actions (such as the aforementioned scene with his wife) impressively disgust in a world in which audiences are so desensitized to violence and on-screen abuse.Supporting characters aside, the standout of this film is without question Sally Hawkins, whose performance as a mute woman forces upon her the unique challenge of making an audience empathize with her in spite of a lack of speech. She does this through her playfulness; her love of art, particularly music and musicals, the way she tap dances her way to work when no one is watching, and palpable emotions that require no voice to express. Her sign language offers one of the film's most spectacular visuals, and del Toro knows this, choosing to place the subtitles as close to her hands as possible so as not to detract too much attention.Though more attention could have been diverted to Doug Jones as the Asset, and the creature's general quirky mannerisms, it is the scenes that he shares with Eliza that are the film's most tender. Throughout Eliza's interactions with her two friends (Zelda and Giles), while it's established that the two characters care about her deeply, we get the sense that her muteness is being taken advantage of, as both endlessly vent their personal struggles and anxieties to her with no one to cut them off. Such is the reason for Eliza's infatuation with the Asset, itself a speechless creature that doesn't see Eliza as incomplete in the slightest. When the two finally bring their relationship to the next level, like the supporting cast, we the audience have no problem accepting it. Both employ wildly different means of communication; Eliza's an organized series of gestures whereas the Asset's are primal and animalistic. However, when the two finally bring their relationship to the next level, like the supporting cast, we the audience have no problem accepting it.The Shape of Water is hardly a fantasy. Ultimately, it's a film about tolerance. An allegory for all of history's outcasts that attempts to shine a light on the conditions from which real monsters are born. Like it's moral message of acceptance, del Toro extends this inclusion to his audience, accepting fans of all genres, offering something truly enjoyable for every kind of moviegoer. The Shape of Water is an extremely confident mesh of comedy, romance, horror, drama and musicals, with enough technical wizardry to impress any cinephile."
16,The Shape of Water,1,7 January 2018,Unbelievable Fairy tale,"Movie started off well, but suddenly an unbelievable storyline appeared. At times it was laughable. If Del Toro had went through the storyline, and ended it as a dream fantasy, and not reality, it would have had legs. Could have been much better."
17,The Shape of Water,1,1 December 2017,love conquers all,"creature from the black lagoon meets mute woman. unfortunately, I must join the 10% who did not like this film. I am a big del toro fan, but this left a very unpleasant taste in my mouth. especially in the present climate of sexual harassment, racism and general hate. the acting is wonderful and in this fantasy world there is more than a touch of reality. it may be fine for critics looking to bestow awards, but as a rabid movie goer I don't always need real."
18,The Shape of Water,4,9 January 2018,"Wow, what a mess!","Take E.T., mash it up with the aesthetic sentiments of Amelie, throw in a dash of The Artist, top it all off with some amazingly open-minded attitudes toward bestiality and you have The shape of Water.Elisa Esposito is a cleaner at a government facility where top secret projects are kept. Her life is pretty hum-drum until one day she meets a creature from the deep at work and gives him an egg. She instantly falls in love with the beastie and talks her bestie Giles, an aging artist with relationship problems of his own, into helping her mount a rescue. Along the way she receives initially reluctant assistance from her workmate, Zelda, as well as the help of a kind-hearted Soviet spy named Dimitri.Visually, the movie is quite nice, the soundtrack was also very well chosen, but as a story the film seemed not to be able to make up its mind exactly what it wanted to be. The romance was rushed and never really felt believable, the best friend neighbor was only likeable sometimes, it seemed to want to make some sort of a social statement about male culture in the 60s, but this was only given, at best a superficial treatment; it kept toying with the idea of becoming a musical right up until it sort of did in a number that seemed as out-of-place, awkward and forced as the romance between Esposito and the creature from the deep.All in all I'd say that this would be one of those films to watch with friends some night for a laugh, but don't expect much more than unintended comedy, as it's otherwise an utter mess."
19,The Shape of Water,3,30 December 2017,Was expecting so much more!,"Based on what had been said in some of the reviews and after having seen an interview with Octavia Spencer, I was anxious to see it. I will say there were so many opportunities for this to be a great movie, but when you have a villain with no redeeming qualities he's just mean. I enjoy a good sex scene as much as the next person, but I couldn't wait for our villain to finish with his wife fast enough. I wish I had waited to see it on tv with all the disturbing parts cut out."
20,The Shape of Water,,11 October 2017,Wow,"Guillermo del Toro's wonderful fable  ""my favourite thing I've ever done""  is kind of like Arrival starring Amélie, as a shy, mute cleaner (Sally Hawkins) at a government base begins to communicate with the aquaman in the tank, and feels the first flickerings of love.Set  like my last film at the LFF, On Chesil Beach  in 1962, it's really about today: a plea for tolerance in the light of Trump and co's war on Muslims, blacks and gays, and a monster movie in which the monster isn't the Other, it's right-wing, gung-ho America, represented here by Michael Shannon, as a psychotic vet in a teal Cadillac who'll beat the living crap out of anything that doesn't conform to his very specific notion of a person. The toxic machismo and vicious hatred of otherness isn't restricted to him, though, it's endemic: and hiding behind the most benign of fronts.Shot in a rich, stylised palette of greens and browns (admittedly more City of Lost Children), set partly above an old, working cinema and filled with little visual effects  though with a creature who's delightfully and resolutely real  it reminded me of nothing as much as Amélie. That 2001 movie might be the last time I felt quite so charmed by a lead character as by Hawkins' Eliza Esposito, whose increasingly appealing, steely, sexy performance recalls that holy trinity of great mute turns: Dorothy McGuire in The Spiral Staircase, Samantha Morton in Sweet and Lowdown and Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda, and is just as full of nobility and pathos; just as lacking in gimmickry.There's nice work too from Richard Jenkins, who is frequently held hostage in underwhelming comedies, but showed in Tom McCarthy's 2007 masterpiece, The Visitor that he's just about the best actor in America when he can be bothered. As Eliza's gay flatmate, a struggling, alcoholic advertising artist, he's never self-pitying or trite, and those traits no more define who he is than the fact he's bald.The plot is fine: diverting, involving and well-balanced between moments of intrigue, suspense and humour, but it's the passages of poetry that completely bewitched me, including one sequence in a waterlogged bathroom that took the breath away.There's another beguiling flight of fancy that memorably references Fred and Ginger's 'Let's Face the Music and Dance', and music is critical to this film: Hawkins and Jenkins engage in an impromptu tap, Alexandre Desplat equips her with the most enchanting theme, and del Toro exhibits his great love for  and understanding of  classic Hollywood by including several clips from old Fox musicals, including Bojangles and Shirley Temple in The Little Colonel and colour clips of Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda rendered in the monochrome of '60s tube TV. Realising that I was in a cinema in which a modern audience was being forced to watch old footage of Alice Faye, and listen to a short monologue discoursing on her ill- fated Hollywood career was just the most delightful thing.So a sci-fi, a horror, a monster movie, a romance, a Cold War thriller, and a history lesson about Alice Faye: this genre-bender is many things, but above all it's an emotional experience, a clear- sighted, glowing-hearted picture with some of the most beautiful imagery and a performance I'm going to be rhapsodising about for weeks, months, years."
21,The Shape of Water,,11 September 2017,"Moving, Beautiful, Flawless Story","Just watched it at TIFF and as much as I knew it would be beautiful, nothing prepared me to be so very moved by the story, the way it was told and the delicate details that make of this the most beautiful, moving story I have ever watched.Of course I cried more than once, and over 2 hours after leaving the movie theater (the same where the movie was actually filmed in Toronto), my heart is still heavy in an uplifting and hopeful way.There aren't any words to describe this gorgeous piece of art... as usual.. the effects, the creatures, the colors and most importantly, the words of the narrator (just like in Pan's) move you to no end..."
22,The Shape of Water,5,25 December 2017,Hands Labyrinth,"Okay, first, the good stuff: The sets (which deserve an Oscar) and the cinematography were eye-poppingly-amazing. Desplat's score was moving and beautiful. Richard Jenkins stole every scene he was in - as always.Now, the bad stuff: Sally Hawkins masturbating in the bath every single morning while the eggs are boiling (hence the title of this review) added nothing to the story. Michael Shannon buying a new car added nothing to the story. The Astaire-Rogers, song-n-dance, black-n-white dream sequence completely ruined any magic that had been established.
Look, I know this is a fantasy, but, fish sex, really? Not only that, she went to work and played kiss-n-tell, describing the fish dick to Octavia Spencer (who, sadly, has become typecast.) The writing was just weak. Every character was a cliched, cardboard cutout. The love story read like a bad Harlequin Romance paperback meets The Creature from the Black Lagoon meets Splash meets Mr. Limpet.Overall, I would say, if you are a serious filmophile, see this for the eye candy. That's all there really is to this fantasy.
If you are a lonely, looking-for-Mr. Right, 40-something dreamer, this could possibly be your favorite movie of all time."
23,The Shape of Water,2,29 December 2017,Not as advertised. Not original at all.,"Advised as ""From master story teller, Guillermo del Toro"" yet every possible liberal stereotype and emo string pulling. Totally predictable."
24,The Shape of Water,5,16 December 2017,The Shape Of Fish Guy's Schvantz,"Really Del Toro? This constitute a love story?
This movie is designed for shut-in crazy cat ladies who dream of banging inanimate objects...for life. Then the Pinocchio comes to life.
Though beautiful in its art design, why does everything in this world look like a terrible sound stage? It's not magical, mystical or captivating. It's gross and awkward and mean. People brought their children to this movie. And saw 1) middle aged chesticles 2) Michael Shannon humping his wife brutally. It was so awkward and not the least bit ""romantic."" Can anyone explain how a top secret facility with a Fishman can still allow a woman to have lunch and play Glenn Miller records in the company of?! What nonsense is this? Oh right, it's a fable. Or something. Wait, how does Michael Shannon tell biblical stories in a fable. Wow is that meta.
This movie is just awkward. You stumble out of the theater just flabbergasted at what passes as romance these days. This mute chick will do it with anything."
25,The Shape of Water,2,21 November 2017,Her Splash,"A friend of mine who liked ""Her"" like this movie. I can see why. There was no human good enough for each lead in each movie. I was looking for a ""Splash"" ending & I got it. Spinster and the Beast. And let's demolish the idea that spinsters are not sexual with plenty of hand solo examples. My friend obviously lives in a fantasy world of singlehood."
26,The Shape of Water,10,23 September 2017,"Thrilling, Touching and Surreal Exploration of the Heart; Both Human and Monster","To be seen and desired for who we truly are; it is the passionate wish of many. For Elisa, an unassuming and kind-hearted maid in a 1960s era government lab, this wish is granted in an unusual way. Virtually invisible and isolated, yet content in her little bubble, Elisa is lured from this comfort zone as she witnesses the arrival of a strange, monstrous sea creature in the lab. Despite warnings to keep her distance, Elisa sympathizes with the suffering creature. It is in chains and tortured by Strickland, a sadistic and violent government agent. This wild creature is impulsive. It responds to aggression with the same, and to kindness with kindness. As the cruelty of Strickland escalates, Elisa decides she must act to save the creature. Friendly and opposing forces emerge from unlikely places to help or hinder her. Love and light hinge on the erratic hearts of monsters and humans alike.This thrilling, touching and surreal film explores the many forms and aspects of monsters. The worst monster of them all is the human heart, and yet it is also the most kind and beautiful. The film offers apt encouragement to speak up and act when others are in trouble and in pain. In this world of rising fascists who peddle hatred and opposition to science, art, sympathy and basically to all humanity, such encouragement is sorely needed.With expressive eyes and strong empathy, Sally Hawkins is amazing and mesmerizing in her portrayal of Elisa. Michael Shannon is perfectly cast as the crude, cruel, sarcastic and controlling Strickland. In Strickland's sinful, selfish and negative world, the monster is better off dead. The supporting cast is wonderful. The film is full of depth and splendor. The Southern United States is the setting, yet the film was shot in Toronto. The theater that appears prominently on screen is the very same theater (the Elgin) in which I saw the film at the Toronto International Film Festival. I went into the theater with high hopes and was not disappointed."
27,The Shape of Water,8,27 November 2017,A Beautifully Shot Film,"Being praised around the world as one of the best films of the year from people visiting festivals, The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's latest venture into the strange and moving area of film. From Pan's Labyrinth to recent films like Pacific Rim, I've always enjoyed watching his films. While I won't be praising this film as much as some people have been, it will easily be receiving a recommendation from my end, but to the right crowd. The Shape of Water is a beautiful, yet strange tale of romance, and even though you've seen this particular story many times over, I feel as though there is enough of a fresh spin to win fans over. Here are my thoughts on The Shape of Water.To get this out of the way, people will surely be going into this film and receiving flashbacks from films like Beauty and the Beast, Splash, or even Shrek. Taking place in a fantasy world where men capture exotic creatures and use them to experiment on, Eliza discovers the creature after being tortured. Forming a very close bond with him, forming a plan to help him escape, and having him stay in her bathtub where he can have room to breathe, this very quickly becomes a very strange romantic tale that people will either buy into or find themselves wondering why they're watching this movie in the first place.Throughout the course of the film, certain characters will present themselves in order to provide fear to the creature or to make you side with him, so that the story may progress. There are definitely a few forced aspects about this film, but when everything is filmed and presented so wonderfully, it's hard to let that clash with your enjoyment of the movie as a whole. To add to that, it was clear that certain scenes or lines of dialogue were added to the film in order to give it a sense of realism, but some of the vulgarity actually took me out of the overall experience, due to the fact that it wanted to get you emotionally invested at the same time. You'll know what I mean if you choose to check out this film.Aside from appearances in Paddington or Blue Jasmine, I'd never really thought about Sally Hawkins as a leading lady of a major production, but sometimes you're proved to be severely wrong because her performance here floored me. I was incredibly invested in every single moment her character was on-screen and anything I didn't like about this movie faded away every time she interacted with someone and had to display her emotions through her sign language or by just simply tearing up or showing emotion through her eyes. I will be remembering this performance as one of the best of the year by year.In the end, where I think this film slightly fails is in its addition of human villains. The Shape of Water is a beautiful romance at its core, but I didn't feel the movie shows quite enough of it to really be a masterpiece, even though the production designers sure made it feel like a damn elegant piece of cinema. If for nothing else, the set design, along with the visual effects and art direction, will surely be included in the awards season to come, because it's some of the best I've seen all year (possibly even the absolute best). Overall, I can call The Shape of Water a damn solid film, but it's not quite as wonderful as I was hoping it would be. To fans of strange or unique films, I recommend you check out this movie. Many people seem to be adoring this film, and while I agree that it's impressive, it's just hard not to compare it to many similar concepts. A great, yet familiar experience."
28,The Shape of Water,1,10 January 2018,We get it. Straight White Men Are Evil..,"Besides being long, weird and cheesy, the film goes for the trifecta of evil when it comes to white men. They hate gay people, they hate black people and they sexually harass women. Oh, and they are bad in bed and hate animals. Could you imagine if the sex scene with his wife was done by a black man? The outrage of how racist it would be? LOL... Surprisingly, this doesn't add or take away from the story line, which is a little weird..Save your money.. Unless you like bashing white dudes. Then this movie is for you."
29,The Shape of Water,9,12 September 2017,A 60's era sci-fi fairy-tale made for today's society,"Set during the 1960's space race in Baltimore, the story is a beautiful sci-fi fairy tale that explores the unexpected love between the mute cleaning lady Eliza (Sally Hawkins) and the mysterious amphibious creature (Doug Jones) trapped at the government facility she works at. When Eliza escapes with the creature thanks to the help from a gallery of colourful characters, we see the bond between woman and creature grow from mutual friends to lovers. And if that sounds like it wouldn't work on film, Guilllermo Del Torro can sell it and make it work. While the story of a mute women falling in love with the Creature from the Black Lagoon sounds simple, Shape of Water is anything but which helps it to speak relevance to today's Trump-age judgmental society. Each character is so wonderfully defined and explored through arcs that relate back to Del Torro's classic narratives about the underdog, persecuted and the silenced. We root for Eliza and the creature's relationship because they both know the feeling of people not understanding who they are. With her voice literally being robbed as an infant, Eliza lives a life of silence and always listening but wants someone who truly looks past her disability. Her routinely morning masturbation tells how she how wishes to be loved both physically and emotionally. Only called ""the Asset"", the creature is an anomaly of nature that also wishes for comfort especially since he was taken away from his native home in the Amazon and forced to be a prisoner and experiment for the US government. Eliza's best friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) lives in a strained relationship with a husband who ignores her at home. This leaves her to talk to about her marital problems to her mute friend who automatically listens. Eliza's neighbour and father-figure Giles (Richard Jenkins) is a failing advertisement artist who feels out of place in the world because of his age and homosexuality. The scientist/Russian spy Dimitri (Michael Stuhlberg) feels conflicted between his home country and the preservation of the Asset when both the Americans and Russians seek its death to each further their agenda in the Space Race. Even the villain Strickland (Michael Shannon) has his own ark. He constantly sees whether they are women, lower class, African American or non-human creatures are beneath him and wishes to be part of what he perceives to be the future of a better America but fears being left behind in the past. These characters struggle with communication in different ways from living in silence, hiding their true selves from a judgmental world, not having their ideas understood or preferring to have others be silent. As expected with Del Torro, his visually stunning colour palette is ever present with each shot of the film. From the wardrobe, the look of the government facility, the vehicles to even the food, green dominates the film reflecting off cool, organic algae and water. With the cinematographer Paul D. Austerberry, he creates long panning shots that move so beautiful and organicly which leads to an amazing dance sequence that would put La La Land to shame. Vanessa Taylor whom has wrote a few episodes of Game of Thrones, has written some of the best work I have seen Del Torro direct. Sally Hawkins is the true standout of this show. While not having to use dialogue (minus that one amazing dance sequence I mentioned), she relies on so much sincere and emotional expressions to really show how her character thinks and reacts. I will say it will be criminal if she doesn't get nominated for best actress next year. This being his 6th film working with Del Toro, Doug Jones as the Asset uses mime-like hand gestures to make the this character feel believable and intelligent with a human-like curiosity and soul. Just like in Hidden Figures this year, Octavia Spencer is just a breath of fresh air to watch and adds so much fun to the scenes. Richard Jenkins nearly steals the show with his dry witted and charming performance as his character Giles. While some may say Michael Shannon is getting type-cast as villains, his performance is a reminder why he is so amazing at it. Guillermo Del Torro I have always loved to watch whether his films are these prestigious art pieces or just fun blockbusters. But Shape of Waters feels like new ground that he has tapped into. At the Q & A for TIFF where I saw the film, the reason for him creating this story was a response to how America's persecution of minorities had risen since the Trump's presidential campaign. This is the most relevant film Del Toro has made and is his best masterpiece since Pan's Labyrinth."
30,The Shape of Water,2,4 January 2018,'Amelie' under water...,"Really not sure why this is getting so many plaudits? Yes the art direction is pretty enough, but the pace is so slow and for me it was annoyingly whimsical!I found Sally Hawkins' studied, almost balletic way of performing really off-putting. As an example the folding of the hat against the bus window and the overly-ponderous way she laid her head against it.Apparently it cost $20 million and for me this is no surprise with the whole thing looking set-bound and claustrophobic.It was a surprise-free zone with obvious themes, cliches galore (other than the lure of the Director's name what was in it for Octavia Spencer with such a stereotypical role?), plot-holes and scenes that dragged.Reviewers seem to be adding layers of narrative and meaning, but in reality I'm really not sure there's enough there to bother.#disappointed"
31,The Shape of Water,1,10 January 2018,It's Garbage..,"At a top secret research facility in the 1960s, a lonely janitor forms a unique relationship with an amphibious creature that is being held in captivity. Where do i start with 'The Shape of Water'? Except that the film was garbage fire it was also weird and stupid. Sally Hawkins every morning was touching her self, Michael Shannon has an awkward sex scene that is even more awkward than the sex scene between Hawkins and the creature it self and above all the comedic parts were so dumb (that scene where she picks the fingers was stupid) and above all the film was boring from start to finish and i wonder if that's what all this Oscar bait films have in common this year: bland characters, weird jokes and above all slow pacing that drags and never stops. (0/10)"
32,The Shape of Water,4,9 January 2018,Guillermo del Toro Lost It,"Well, as a white male hetero guy I take the movie as a persiflage of white male whatever-behavior (but I suspect some of the ""good guys and gals of Hollywood"" really think we behave like that in real life). And yes, I confess - the role and acting of Michael Shannon has its strong points and I had a lot of fun watching him.So, as I don't feel offended by the story and the caricaturistication of certain groups of people I have one big complain: after half an hour I was almost bored to death by the movie. 
Guillermo del Toro did a few very good to good movies, but put away all the fuss about certain cliches in his newest one what we get is, well, a very boring story and to add some more pain, a veeeerrry slooooowly ooooone too.Pans Labyrinth is imo one of the new modern classics, and I like Crimson Peak a lot. Hellboy I and II are good. Pacific Rim was a typical Hollywood blockbuster and imo just something like a pimped up Independence Day, and as Crimson Peak had some fine acting and fine cinematography the story itself was very standard. The Shape of Water is not only a standard story but a boring one too (at least how it is told by Guillermo del Toro ) and regarding the ""look"" of the movie, he did already far better jobs. Final words: funny for me is - the one interesting and best part of the whole movie is the performance of Michael Shannon: a white, hetero (bad behaving) man. Damn. It looks like we are the best or at least most interesting kind after all - but I admit, it may be that I am a lil' biased here ;)"
33,The Shape of Water,1,31 December 2017,A big pile of Nope,"At the beginning of the movie, it was going ok. Characters were predictable, kind of underdeveloped. A little slow, and lots of plot hole questions. But I can look past that stuff and still enjoy a movie. Especially in a romance story.
Halfway in the movie, through, stuff went south. Water creature ate a cat. 
-Nope. Not ok with that.
And they showed it.
-Almost vomited in my seat.
And they showed a headless body. 
-Started crying and wondered who in their right mind puts this in a 'romance' story. So much for my date night.
Characters acted like it was nothing..even making jokes about it later on.
-How the heck are they ok with that? How are they not traumatized seeing a PET just gobbled up? I don't care if the guy said it's 'nature' And 'doing what's natural.' Nope. I would dry the creature up with a blow dryer and tell my neighbor she has bad taste in...whatever it is she's attracted to. Normal people don't let their lovers eat their pet cats. 
So yeah, after that it was just downhill. I kept thinking of ways the characters could avenge Pandora, the kitty, and was glad the crazy guy shot them. Even if they survived and he didn't, I gave a whoop in the audience. Love story? More like a nightmare because of unnecessary shock violence (I get voilence but not when it's overdone and has no meaning to the development of the plot, especially in a ROMANCE), stale characters with no development (How many times will Octavia play the same supporting role?), and random water fapping scenes."
34,The Shape of Water,9,2 September 2017,"Who are YOU trying to kid, paul-64175?","Aside from the central premise of a romance between a human woman and an amphibious humanoid, ""The Shape of Water"" and ""Mrs. Caliban"" have nothing in common. Dorothy is a bereaved mother estranged from her husband who meets Larry after he's escaped; Elisa is a mute orphan who finds the Asset while cleaning the lab where he's being held and decides to help him get free. A cursory watching of the trailer for ""The Shape of Water"" should make it clear it's telling a different story than Ingalls' book."
35,The Shape of Water,1,13 January 2018,Utter Rubbish,"Beautifully filmed, excellent actors, great props and very expensive to make, so why didn't they make a really good Cold War movie instead of a totally lame one based on a crude B Movie monster in a cheap fishman wetsuit.The result is an insult to the intelligence of a 5 year old let alone worthy of awards other than maybe cinematography. My advice, save your money and don't patronise lowbrow trash like this as it just seems to encourage Hollywood to further lows."
36,The Shape of Water,3,11 January 2018,Soft Aquatic Porn,"Sadly, I cannot share the public enthusiasm for this uninspiring film. The movie was predictable, the relationship was not plausible and the dialogue lacked depth."
37,The Shape of Water,5,8 January 2018,Splash!,"The most over rated film since 'Get Out'. Cloying, sentimental, mawkish; saved by wonderful performances by Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon and Richard Jenkins."
38,The Shape of Water,5,9 January 2018,A deranged low budget Spielberg movie,"The movie has no sense of balance. It tries to do too much and doesn't do enough of what it does very well.Del Toro seems to always insist on R ratings--which so far sunk his Lovecraft adaptation AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS from happening. He likes to mix ugly and fantasy--sometimes this works, this time it doesn't.In this case you have rather graphic nudity and violence mixed in with Spielberg type elements. Or maybe it's just that the design and performance of the fishman looks like skinny guy in a Ok monster suit.Mix this up with Cold War crisis and artificial period ambience and a frustrated gay sub plot and what do you have, I guess like water is has no shape and pardon the pun but a snail-like pace.Other problem is the villain is overdone, it'd be more interesting if the villain wasn't one dimensional.Oh and did I mention the musical scene? It's a bold idea executed in a flat fashion that is unintentionally funny--or like too much of the film it wants to have it both ways, be funny but true in spirit, ugly but fantastical.Del Toro's English films often suffer from clunky dialogue, this one does too and mixes in too much modern foul language for the period story.Yeah what are all these things doing in one movie? Adding up to a movie that doesn't work."
39,The Shape of Water,3,9 January 2018,Believed little except the acting.,"I give this movie 3 stars only.
The story (concept) was intriguing, but
The writing was muddled, and dialogue often made no sense.
The casting and acting were spot on but 
The directing and editing were strangely bad. I mean in the shot to shot, the cutting, the way the scenes followed each other. Logic and clarity went out the window.I have only one rule when I am being entertained. (Incorporating style always,) do I BELIEVE what I'm watching? Throughout this movie, I kept being pulled up short.
The creature's costume, why no attempt to integrate the face with scales? oh no, mustn't completely hide the actor's handsome American features.
Our heroine, was she to be pitied? No, she had friends and sympathy all around. Not downtrodden.
These cleaning ladies, since when were cleaning ladies in public spaces chatted up by absolutely everybody as ""equals"" even in the toilet?
I could go on, and on, and on, but cannot be bothered. This was an ego trip by one person, the movie maker.
I comment that people are afraid to come out and criticise for fear of sounding ignorant. I forecast that it will do no business at the box offce."
40,The Shape of Water,2,9 January 2018,REALITY CHECK,"I gave this film two stars; one for Guillermo Del Toro because he is a truly talented man and one star because when this film shined, it really shined. The performances were excellent. The directing was what we have come to expect from Guillermo Del Toro. But, that's about it.The film started out rather well. The plot was taking shape very nicely and there was some good character development in the little time afforded for that purpose. The plot was moving along smoothly and then, without any warning whatsoever, the wheels came off. Our dear Eliza falls in love and has sex with the fish man in a bathroom turned into a love pong with nothing more than a few towels jammed under the door to stop up the water flooding from sink and tub.Ok....after some deep breaths and a few silent ""wtf's"" muttered under my breath to myself, I was able to manufacture just enough suspension of disbelief to wash it down. Perhaps the ending would convince me to overlook this nonsense?Nope. Not a chance. It only got worse.The entire film crashed at precisely the when Eliza and the frog man actually performed a choreographed number where Eliza lip-syncs the words to a song about how much she loves Charlie, the Tuna, complete with big band, fake stars and a really shiny, black dance floor. Its been a very long time since I have witnessed such a laughable, cringe worthy scene. I mean, what the happened here? At what point during the script reviews and edits DIDN""T someone raise their hand and say ""ya know, this is kinda stupid?"" If this was an attempt to artfully convey the sentiment of ""love is blind"" or ""the heart wants what it wants"" or ""love can break down the barriers of whatever is in its way"", then, that attempt failed.......horribly....painfully......pathetically.....tragically. The fact that this film earned a Golden Globe is a testament to how the industry is still afraid to call out the king and his new clothes. Do not waste your time with this film. Its two hours of my life I will never get back."
41,The Shape of Water,3,8 January 2018,Is this moving endorsing bestiality?,"That is the question I was asking myself throughout the whole film. I don't get this movie. Its like a poorly written automatically generated fairy tale on you tube kids or something. No idea why it got such great ratings on here and Meta-critic. Maybe people just love it because they are fans of his other work. I have no idea. I personally loved most of Del Toro's work (Pans Labyrinth, Orphanage and Don't be Scared of the Dark) but this film is mediocre at best. It could of been way better. It's a romance about a woman and a fish man. Complete waste of time. I waited so long for nothing. Extremely disappointed."
42,The Shape of Water,10,17 November 2017,A love story we all need to watch in these dark times,"I saw this film at TIFF in Sept, and it is absolutely brilliant. It is much needed in today's world, because it sub textually shows us about the outdated thoughts on masculinity, sexuality and love. It shows us that love can blossom anywhere. It may be my favorite del Toro film, which is saying a lot. Please click the link to watch my video review, and I hope you enjoy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPXZhbiGf4Q"
43,The Shape of Water,1,11 January 2018,Waste Of Time Movie,"Why in hell does have 8/10 rating ? 
(IMDB, please fix your rating system, like some sort of rating per country/region)"
44,The Shape of Water,2,9 January 2018,Waste of time,"Nudity galore wrapped up in artistic filmmaking. We try hard to enjoy this movie still and while the acting was great it just missed the mark. I couldn't wait till it was over.
The movie would have been much much better if we had left the love of the creature out. I was expecting so much better from the director of Pan's Labyrinth."
45,The Shape of Water,4,8 January 2018,"Blah, Blah, Blah","This film about a mute, tap-dancing woman who works as a cleaning lady in a dreary government lair and falls in love with a sea beast is one part Bjork's Dancer in the Dark, one part Amelie, and one part Free Willy. Ugh."
46,The Shape of Water,5,8 January 2018,Good things do not overcome the bad,"The camera work, graphics, music and the acting are all top-notch. Unfortunately the plot is kinda ho-hum and makes no sense in parts. There's a few really inappropriate scenes involving graphic sex, dialogue regarding body parts, a scene involving a cat, graphic violence... they added nothing at all to the story. I found myself shaking my head like 5-6 times saying ""why did you need to include that?!?"""
47,The Shape of Water,2,9 January 2018,hmmm what did i just see?,Just all and all wierd movie. Had pretty high hopes of seeing something diffrent with some form of twist but just predictable and stupid.
48,The Shape of Water,6,5 November 2017,Nice,"Seen at the Viennale 2017: it is good, they chose Sally Hawkins for the main cast. Very well done story telling. It is all a bit too aesthetically. And too predictable. And all feelings are told. There was not much room for my own fantasies. Everything was shown. No space in-between left. If you want to go to the movies for an evening for sheer, perfectly done entertainment - go for it!"
49,The Shape of Water,7,2 December 2017,The Shape of Water (2017),"Guilermo del Toro is a solid filmmaker. I'm not overly crazy about his work and don't rate him as highly as many others do, but the visual beauty of his films cannot be denied. I am not crazy about Pans Labyrinth or Pacific Rim but I do actually love Crimson Peak. I was always going to check out The Shape of Water to see if Toro could follow up Crimson Peak with an equally outstanding piece of cinema. While The Shape of Water isn't amazing its quite enjoyable.The film takes place in the 1960's where a mute cleaning women finds a creature has been captured by a Colonel and starts bonding with this otherwordly creature. She attempts to free the creature and falls in love along the way. On the other hand, the Colonel is an aggressive man and is abusive towards the creature and then goes all out to try to figure out who helped the creature escape. The film is set with a back drop of U.S./Soviet tensions and plays a part in minor aspects of the film.This is definitely the best Sally Hawkins performance to date. She is wonderful as a mousy mute woman and does so much terrific acting in the absence of words. Michael Shannon was just born to play a villain and pulls off a typically good Michael Shannon performance. While this film isn't as visually stunning as some of del Torro's other work, the creature design, camera work, and costume and set design is still very top notch.I'd say one thing about Del Torro's film that could be a criticism is the writing. The film is fairly predictable. Its good, but goes down a route that we've seen in similar type of films. Its an entertaining film but its not anything jaw dropping visually or creatively. Strong performances and del Torro's imaginative creature creation keeps the film moving and he creates characters you want to root for. Its not del Torro's best but its definitely going to please his die hard fans.7.5/10"
50,The Shape of Water,10,14 November 2017,Original remake,"I knew I know the story when I saw first few seconds of the trailer and yet the cast did not seem familiar... I know del Toro will not disappoint, looking back on his previous work. If you would like to get a short summary of the movie, just look up The Space Between Us (2015), you will get the original story in just 12 minutes."
51,The Shape of Water,10,10 January 2018,a beautiful fable.,"I never know what to expect from the Guilhermo Del Toro films, he is a director who made the spectacular El Laberinto del Fauno which is one of the best fantasy films of the genre, but the rest of his filmography I've never been much of a fan of his films, Cronos is a good movie, The Devil's Backbone is cool, but I expected more, Blade and Hellboy I admit I have not watched yet, Pacific Rim disappointed me a lot, even though it's cool too and Crimson Peak is pretty weak and now comes The Shape of Water that is placed as one of the favorites to win the Oscar for best film, and look I think it will win (even with defeat in the golden globe), is one of the best films of 2017 without doubts, a touching and very beautiful film Guilhermo Del Toro does a great job with the characters in the film, but it is not a good idea to have a good ending. your best I work in directing, he does wonderful scenes and there are moments that would give an excellent picture to put on the wall, and in my view he deserves to win Oscar for best director, the film does not lose its rhythm, I do not like romance, but it was Impossible not to like the chemistry of the protagonist Elisa with the amphibious creature, the relationship of the 2 is very well built, the cast is excellent, Sally Hawkins made my favorite female performance of 2017 and I will hope her win the Oscar, she can transmit emotions Even without talking about the film, it's hard for you not to get infected with the character and cheer for her in the film, Michael Shannon is fine as always, you feel angry about your character, even if he has moments that he is a bit generic, but I liked the character in the film, Octavia Spencer is great, I really liked her character and how she is also built her relationship with Elisa, you see that it is a true friendship between the two, and even in difficult times help one another, Ric hard Jenkins is great too, is a character who also has a nice friendship with Elisa and he has a very important role in the film, Doug Jones the actor who always is with Guilhermo Del Toro, is an actor who deserves more recognition for his work, he is always characters that uses a lot of makeup, but he can handle very well always, the creature that is even very well made and looks great, not to mention the beauty of the creature, the rest of the cast is also very competent, the trail Alexandre Desplat's sound is impeccable, it's a smooth and great listening track, a great favorite in the Oscar of the best soundtrack and if you win it's going to be very well deserved, The Shape of Water is a masterpiece, a touching, romantic and very beautiful film , with excellent scenes, impeccable performances, an incredible direction from Del Toro and a very original and very well done script, is a great competitor to take Oscar for best film. Note 10"
52,The Shape of Water,3,10 January 2018,Disappointing,"I was really excited to see this movie. I'm a fan of GDT, especially his movie Pan's Labyrinth. After seeing the trailer for The Shape of Water and all the hype it started receiving I knew I really wanted to see this film and boy was I disappointed when I did. I was expecting the same kind of whimsical feel / story as some of his other movies and instead got something that at times was almost absurdly laughable. Yes, this is a fairy tale but even fairy tales need to have some rhyme and reason. The movie was incredibly predictable in most parts and in other so ridiculous that even for make belief it was too contrived. There were a few bits that were inserted in for some kind of effect that were so out of place and unnecessary that it just looked silly and I found myself flat out laughing at the absurdity. I will say that all the actors did do a good job with their roles and the sets and imagery in parts was really beautiful and well done. Outside of that what I thought was going to be a magical movie turned out to be very underwhelming, making me wonder why it's receiving the praise that it is. See the trailer which is much more captivating."
53,The Shape of Water,5,23 December 2017,Fell short,"Masterfully shot and beautifully acted, it's definitely go to be a contender for awards season, especially for makeup. I was riveted watching Doug Jones in action. Also, Sally Hawkins gave an amazing portrayal as a lonely mute, and Richard Jenkins shined on screen. He was truly the high point of the film for me.What fell short for me was the extreme portrayal of evil. Michael Shannon was cruel enough without showing such violence. He was truly the monster. I found myself looking away a lot at the end. It was unnecessary. The doctor was a pseudo hero in that film. He tottered between good and evil. His storyline seemed to be lacking depth. The Russians didn't make enough of a bid for the creature to ever feel that they were a viable threat to his survival. I wished they had either flushed that storyline out or eliminated the characters all together.The love story lacked chemistry and although I hoped for the creature's release, I would've been fine with his love interest returning to her normal life with her best friend."
54,The Shape of Water,7,16 January 2018,"Not disastrous, but failed to match the high expectation set.","IMDB users appear incredibly divided over The Shape of Water, with many hailing it as a masterpiece and others dismissing it as a horrendously overrated piece of film making. I believe the film lies towards the former, but fails to reach it by a considerable margin.As the lead role, you may expect Sally Hawkins to deliver the most accomplished performance in the film. However, that acclaim definitely lends itself more to Michael Shannon's ruthless and compelling depiction of ""patriotic"" agent Strickland, which I believe is unparalleled by another member of the cast. Guillermo del Toro delivers some favourable, though not entirely innovative or exceptional cinematography and direction (including a moderately effective score). The Shape of Water deserves praise for it's largely successful composite of comedic and serious, violent moments. There aren't a tremendous number of overt flaws with The Shape of Water, it merely fails to deliver consistently high quality material."
55,The Shape of Water,10,16 January 2018,Best of 2017: A Narrative on Love Vs Fear,"I always argue against the concept of Hate being opposite to Love. I think opposite to Love is Fear. When you love someone, you open up to the possibility of being hurt to an extent. Fear makes people uptight, closed. I think The Shape of Water is a great narrative to this Love Vs Fear concept.I love Sally Hawkins. She always play very optimistic, lovable, free spirit type of characters (also watch Happy-Go-Lucky). Here she plays Elisa, who is open to new experiences, pleasure of the senses, loves people, and has a pleasure association with water - which may be synonymous to loving life. Her painter neighbor Giles is also like her, loves art and authenticity, knows to look past fear. The antagonist Richard (Michael Shannon) is the stark opposite of her, afraid of failure, losing, perceives pleasure as something bad, racist, lacks empathy, has a sort of rotten heroic theme, obsesses over objects which will make him seem bigger than other people.Elisa loves this different, other worldly being. She sees the Amphibian Man as she herself is, a loving creature. Richard sees 'it' as something dangerous, something beneath him. I think there is a hint of xenophobia inherent in the plot. Another noticeable thing is that when Giles is wounded by the creature, he perceives it as an accident and heals up. Richard was unable to move past the violent incident of losing his two fingers, the wound also didn't heal. Richard is the embodiment of all the people who cannot outgrow fear. Placing Giles as the narrator of the story, the ending could move past the narrowness of reality.Also loved how Dr. Hoffstetler & Zelda tried to outgrow the culture of fear. Dr. Hoffstetler tried to outgrow Cold War, the mindset of hating and fearing the other side. Zelda outgrew slave morality by doing the right thing, even if it meant committing sin or breaking the law.To me it is the best movie of 2017."
56,The Shape of Water,8,16 January 2018,A Visual Treat- Fantasy.,"First of all, do not compare to any of the films. Enjoy this movie as itself.Elisa is a janitor working in a top secret research facility in the 60's. She is very lonely, though a man and woman always there for her. She finds a creature captured in the facility and develops feeling for it. Richard is a cruel man appointed to tame the creature.The films is a beautiful visual treat, supported by amazing sound design. The extraordinary performance of the actors nailed it to the core. The performance of Sally Hawkins is promising and deserves appreciation. I really loved the performance from Michael Shannon, he really shines over all other cast.Just sit back, relax and enter the fantasy world.

58,The Shape of Water,3,15 January 2018,E.T. in a bath.,"I'm not sure replacing Elliot with a frustrated, mute, female Noah Taylor; the alien with one of Dr Who's sea devils; filling the script with ridiculous plot holes; and suspending disbelief way beyond breaking point is enough to prevent Spielberg taking a share of the limited royalties this rip off might manage to scrape together.You may get a neck strain from shaking your head a few too many times as the nonsense unfolds."
59,The Shape of Water,1,15 January 2018,Just Bad,Jumpy scene transitions and lack of any logic made this movie just awful. Not worth seeing
60,The Shape of Water,5,15 January 2018,"An inferior gender reversed version of the 1984 film ""Splash""","I'm surprised and no one seems to have realized this is a gender reversed version of the 1984 film ""Splash"", directed by Ron Howard, starring Tom Hanks in the rescuer role, and Daryl Hannah in the ""merman"" role.Consider how similar the IMDB synopsis for ""Splash"" is to the plot of ""The Shape of Water"".Synopsis While on a boat at Cape Cod in 1964 with his family, Allen Bauer sees something in the water and dives in, much to the alarm of his family. Unknown to them, Allen has actually seen a little mermaid. However, no one else sees her as Allen is plucked from the water and returned to his parents, much to the sadness of the mermaid as she watches the boat leave. 20 years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) now runs his family's produce distribution business, as well as continues his boyish search to find true love. Along with his feelings, Allen must also contend with his lecherous but still caring brother Freddie (John Candy), who takes love a bit less seriously than his brother. Allen lives with his girlfriend but she breaks up with him over the phone, leaving Allen depressed and despondent. After attending the wedding of a work associate (Bobby Di Cicco), Allen gets drunk and for some reason, decides to go to Cape Cod while his brother runs off to Rio de Janeiro with two attractive single women. Arriving at the Cape, Allen comes across a short-tempered scientist named Cornbluth (Eugene Levy), who is there to search for mermaids in the waters off the town (unknown to his two bumbling crewmembers, or Allen). Allen charters a small motorboat to get to a nearby island, but a mishap sends him over the side. After almost drowning, Allen finds himself on land with a beautiful naked blonde woman (Daryl Hannah), who quickly disappears back into the water (once in the water, her legs become fins, unseen to Allen). Allen pleads to know who she is, but she does not respond. In the water, the mermaid finds Allen's wallet, and swims away, but not before having a chance encounter with Cornbluth. After swimming away, she goes to a sunken ship, and using the information in his wallet and some old maps in the sunken ship, finds out where Allen lives. A couple days later, Allen returns to New York, and on the same day, the mermaid shows up naked at the Statue of Liberty, with Allen's wallet. Allen receives a call from the NYPD, and heads to the station where the girl is being held. After she is released into his custody, Allen takes her to his apartment. The next day, Allen shows up for work happier than usual, much to the shock of Freddie, to whom Allen decides to give more of the responsibility of the family business. Upon returning home later in the day, Allen is shocked to find the woman is missing. The doorman claims she got in a cab going to Bloomingdale's, and Allen heads there immediately. He finds her there with a whole new wardrobe, and also finds that she is now able to talk. When Allen asks how, she explains that it was by watching television in the store's electronics department. As they walk home, Allen tries to ask her where she's from, but she is scant on details, only to say that she can only stay for 6 days, before the moon is full. When asking her for a name, the concept seems foreign to the woman. As he notes that they are approaching ""Madison Ave,"" the woman decides she likes this name, and so Allen decides to call her Madison. Allen then spends the next couple days away from work getting to know Madison. One evening, he hears her in the bathroom with the door locked, and the water running. When he asks to be let in, she panics and demands that he wait. Allen instead grows worried when he hears a strange thump on the floor (Madison's legs had transformed in the water and she'd flopped out of the tub), and knocks in the door, finding Madison wrapped in a towel on the floor, claiming she didn't want to let him in because she was ""shy."" The next evening, Allen gets Madison a gift, and takes her out for a walk. When the come across a fountain with a mermaid on it, Allen recounts how it reminds him of something, but can't recall just what. Allen also notes that they are planning to remove the fountain and build condo's in the area, which Madison finds sad, thinking the fountain is beautiful. Freddie then informs Allen that he has managed to get tickets to an dinner event that the President of the United States will attend. Allen is impressed, but asks if he can take Madison instead of Freddie along. Freddie playfully teases his brother that he's in love, but Allen insists he's not. Allen goes on to explain that he just isn't sure, and that something just seems strange when it comes to Madison, noting the incident with the TV's as well as the bathroom. Meanwhile, Madison's appearance at the Statue of Liberty has made it into a local tabloid. Cornbluth sees the story, and informs his colleagues in New York. However, one of his colleagues named Dr Ross finds Cornbluth's mermaid theory to be ridiculous. Cornbluth is sure that when she is not in the water, the mermaid's fins become legs on dry land. He then sets out across New York attempting to find Madison and throw water on her. In his attempts, Cornbluth ends up offending the same couple twice and is beaten up. As the days tick away before Madison leaves, Allen attempts to ask her to marry him. However, she refuses Allen's offer, and he grows irritated at her, regarding how secretive she has been about where she comes from. Madison then runs away, and Allen attempts to find her, before returning to the produce center. Shortly after arriving, Madison returns, and this time decides to accept Allen's proposal. Allen is eager to get married now, but decides to do so after the event with the President, planning to drive to Maryland to wed. During the dinner, Madison decides she'll tell Allen her big secret and he agrees to leave with her so they'll have privacy. However, as the two of them are leaving the event, Cornbluth sees Madison, and ends up spraying her with water, revealing her secret to Allen, and to a contingency of press. Both Allen and Madison are taken to a secret location in the New York Natural History Museum, where Allen is also suspected of being part-fish. Allen and Madison are kept in isolation, but Madison is soon put into Allen's tank. She attempts to apologize for not revealing her secret, but Allen silently refuses to listen to her. After it appears he is not of Madison's species, Allen is released, only to be mobbed by press outside his apartment. Freddie manages to get Allen out of there, and they return to the office at the family business. Allen is still upset that in his search for love, the one girl he fell madly in love with has turned out to be a fish. Freddie chastises Allen for his attitude, claiming that in the last few days, his brother has been happier than he's been in years and certainly happier than (Freddie) has ever been with a woman. Cornbluth meanwhile, has been allowed to view Madison, but has not been allowed to voice opinions regarding her care and well-being. The scientist in charge of project, Dr Ross, explains his plan to see how Madison reacts to other marine life before his people dissect her. Cornbluth voices his dissension, but Ross just chides him along. Now feeling miserable for what he has done, Cornbluth is surprised when he is found by Allen at the dentist. Allen has decided that he loves and wants to save Madison, and needs Cornbluth's help. Along with Freddie, the three of them infiltrate the lab, and make off with Madison, leaving Freddie behind to distract them for a bit. Cornbluth and the two brothers impersonate Swedish biologists and are able to bluff their way past the half-Swedish guard when Freddie speaks his language having learned it from watching watching Swedish pornography. Madison's escape is soon found out, and the military begins a chase through the Manhattan streets. Cornbluth at one point jumps out in an attempt to buy some time, but ends up almost being run over. Finally, off a pier on the Hudson River, Madison and Allen say their farewells, with Madison explaining to Allen that he can come with her, but if he does, he cannot come back to land. It is also here that she finally reveals that she was the little girl he saw in the waters off Cape Cod, and Allen is overjoyed to know that it was all real. As the military at first closes in, Allen has Madison swim off, but as he watches her leave, he dives in after her, though he is unable to swim. Just as when he was a boy, Madison rescues Allen, but soon, the two have to contend with divers trying to stop the two of them. After a small skirmish, Madison grabs Allen's hand, and they swim away. Thanks to a kiss by her, Allen is now able to breathe underwater, and after some time swimming, they make their way to a distant underwater kingdom."
61,The Shape of Water,7,15 January 2018,Back to water,"Guillermo del Toro is a great director and a good story-teller. Another story, of magic realism, was presented to viewer's eyes, in a captivating and mysterious cinematographic image. I enjoyed watching this movie and few clues remembered me of something: the speechless etherical woman, her attraction to water, how she was found on the riverbank when she was a baby, the signs on her neck and not the least her love story with that half human, half fish creature. Few minutes after the end of the movie I knew: she resembles the little mermaid who sacrificed her voice, long hair, her immortal life etc. for coming in the human world just for a prince's sake, losing almost everything. This time another little mermaid chose to live in the human world, in a humble and mostly inward way. She was turned back to life and taken away to the sea by a man of her kind. Back to the sea, the justice was done and finally the little mermaid found her peace and true love."
62,The Shape of Water,7,15 January 2018,"Beautiful, odd and emotional dream.","The Shape of Water (2017): I would say this is the kind of film that's more of an experience rather than a movie. Walking out of it, it feels like you just had a really beautiful, odd and emotional dream. Now I'm gonna warn you right away, this isn't a movie for everyone, but I think if you're the right kind of person for it, you already know that you'll like it. It's very art-house, it's very Guillermo Del Toro, it's very weird. Overall I really enjoyed ""The Shape of Water"", it leaves you with a good fuzzy feeling in your heart. I loved seeing every frame of it since Guillermo has a very distinctive and stylized look and tone. He manages to create a real world but with a dash of magic and fairy tale to it. The cinematography was absolutely astonishing (especially the colours), set design/costumes/etc were fantastic, the creature was really cool and pleasant to the eye (good mix of practical and CGI), the acting was good (even though the Russian was iffy). My only problem with the movie was the fact that it felt a little too long, I think a couple of tiny things could've been cut here and there and the movie would've been just as good. There's also a couple of things that felt unaddressed but as the viewer you let it slide and forget about them since you're focused on the main story. Basically, if you knew about this movie and you were interested in seeing it, see it. If you don't know anything about it or the works of Del Torro, probably don't. If I had to boil it down (egg joke) to a score it would be somewhere around 7.5/10 P/SDo NOT see it with kids unless you want to have some VERY awkward moments."
63,The Shape of Water,3,15 January 2018,"considering the high reviews, I excepted a lot more.","Let me cut to the chase, Hellboy was better then this, Del Toro takes the character from that film, puts him here and people are saying this is the best film they have seen in sometime ? Watch that film, Abe Sapien can talk, why Doug Jones chose to be in this film is beyond me, well money is money. They did a great job with the 50's theme here but can we move away from the many negative things of that period, why Del Toro chose a racial, negative on women and just an all around bad time in our history, why not add the KKK as well, for me it was not that good."
64,The Shape of Water,1,15 January 2018,A theft of brain cells so bad it deserves study.,"Update. I really really need to help Hollywood market films. 'The Shape Of Water' is a stupid title. It's how I loved a fish and dumped brain cells into a fish bowl. It's like your grandparents made a bad film and made you watch it. Bioshock was a compliment. This is now officially my all time worst film since the Big Lowbowski. It not that it is dumb. It is so dumb, so bad you actually are angry for the time you wasted watching it. It is the anti gravity of film. I could tell you how much I hate this theft of time and effort but it would not come close to the vortex of insanity and rubbish every cent and moment went into this crime of film making. It I'd not just bad it is beyond the worst thing you ever watched with your eyes. I hate it so much it's awesome in its rubbishness."
65,The Shape of Water,7,15 January 2018,Beautiful and enchanting,"Only Guillermo Del Toro could pitch, ""It's a monster romance picture that feels like Free Willy meets Amelie in the Cold War era."" But you know what? It works. More than that, it is absolutely beautiful and enchanting. There were points where I felt like this story tried a wee bit too hard, but it never strayed far from what it was. It was an un-apologetically monster fairy tale. If you want it to be something else, you will be disappointed. If you let it be what it is, you will enjoy every minute."
66,The Shape of Water,10,15 January 2018,Superb !!!,"The movie is magical and Guillermo and his team, all of them, actors, writers, are geniuses."
67,The Shape of Water,9,14 January 2018,a beautiful sick movies,"Del Toro did it again, using beautiful unreal scenes to depict the cruelty of the reality. The color and the structure of the picture are so joyful, and then some scenes make you not too comfortable. Isn't it good? About the story line, it is just complex enough to make this movie excellent."
68,The Shape of Water,8,27 September 2017,An immersive sci fi film soon to become a classic,"This is about a deaf mute cleaning lady learning to communicate in secret with gentle giant of a creature being experimented on and tortured by a US government agency. She pities the way he is treated and that leads to displays of kindness and affection that are returned by the monster.It is a lavish production with a few twists and turns along the way; it is suitable for all. I think it will become a classic before long.A wonderful bonus was the way the two leading ladies played off of each other.Truly a delightful film.At my screening there was a very memorable Q&A with the director that I would like to share.There were some rather technical questions about Japanese influences in his film (I will look for when I see it again). The amount of time and effort to make a real (man in a suit) rather than CGI monster and that he financed it out of pocket for more than a year before he got financing from Fox. A question about his colour pallet, and a comparison of his film with Beauty in the Beast from a little girl in the audience who spoke in Spanish.He used this question as a springboard to talk about a few topics that were on his mind. You might know the director is from Mexico and now lives in Toronto. He went on to say that many of the problems in the United States are not the fault of Mexico. Also, that the reason that there is so much conflict in the United States is because it is intentionally being done by the government. It is pulling people apart and making them fight each other, because, it doesn't want people uniting together to go after the real problem, the 1%.He said this to great applause. I hope that he has an opportunity to speak to many people about his view of America.This film BTW was filmed in Toronto and premiered in the theatre that was used for many of the scenes."
69,The Shape of Water,9,1 December 2017,Sensational director Guillermo del Toro is back to his roots with The Shape of Water. And it's making a serious splash,"Sensational director Guillermo del Toro is back to his roots with The Shape of Water. And it's making a serious splash.The Shape of Water takes audiences back to the fairy-tale style of earlier movies. The story explores the relationship between mute cleaner Elsa and the creature at the government facility where she works. The premise and plot are a little bizarre, but comfortably so. The plot seems interwoven around some deeper message, as is the case with most of his movies. But there is no explicit social commentary. It is the audience's job to fill that gap.The cold war backdrops The Shape of Water, but it never delves too deep into the background conflict. The cold war element of the movie serves more as a cinematic backdrop than a scathing social commentary, like in Pan's Labyrinth.Del Toro uses a generous amount of tropes, especially regarding Michael Shannon's classic bad- guy role. But with the lighter tone, the movie is freer to explore other themes: love, unity, oneness. Or rather, we are freer to explore the themes within the film.The Shape of Water is at heart a love story, although it feels abstracted enough as to be universally symbolic.Neither the creature or Elsa can speak, and it is through this commonality that they transcend differences of species. And symbolically, other boundaries like race, class, gender, and sexuality. But it's difficult to entirely indulge in the symbolism when the couple grows more intimate with each other. Things get a little strange then, but it's all light-hearted.The creature design was also the best we've seen yet from del Toro. He has always favoured physical costume design over post-production. The amphibian man is no different. He looks all the more real for his physical design. This feels homelier amidst the huge shift towards digital effects in modern cinema. There is still some digital effects, but they aren't noticeable. The amphibian man is of course played by long-time collaborator, Doug Jones, who plays nearly all of del Toro's monsters. His acting is impeccable, as is lead actress Sally Hawkins's.The relationships between other characters is excellently written and performed. The one-sided dialogue between Elsa and every other character is surprisingly evocative. This puts all the more emphasis on Elsa and the amphibian man's relationship.The colour scheme of the movie really sets it out visually. The vast majority of the sets are coloured entirely in varying shades of blue and green: a kind of teal. This reflects the coldness of the outside world, the coldness of water, and also the historical context."
70,The Shape of Water,8,11 November 2017,"Wonderful, beautiful, funny","28th STOCKHOLM INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL. DAY 1, NOV 8th 2017. Nordic premiere of ""The Shape of Water"" (2017).‪Balancing humour and drama impressively, the film contains some fine screen writing and an awe-inspiring performance by great Sally Hawkins.‬‪When writer-director Guillermo del Toro returns with his tenth feature, he delivers another amazing fantasy-drama filled with that deep love for movie-making and the oddities of life that very few other Hollywood directors can match. This is beauty in frames.‬"
71,The Shape of Water,9,14 January 2018,Del Toro´s magum opus,"I gotta be honest, when i found the plot of this movie i was really skeptical, i had no idea of how Del Toro would tell this story and i really thought that this would be not a great movie, beacuse the story seemed a little weird. 
But thank god i was wrong. ""The Shape of Water"" is a beautiful and uncommon love story of a mute woman and a amphibian creature that have to fight to stay together. 
No doubt one of the best movies of 2017 and one to watch at this award season. Guillermo was able to creat a gorgeous movie with a unique love story, that will certainly a classic, no doubt is magum opus."
72,The Shape of Water,9,14 January 2018,Best picture indeed!,"This fantastic love story is very timely. It includes themes that we can all relate to for modern times. Themes like love, acceptance, understanding, hope, and communication. The visuals, story, musical score, soundtrack and the performances are so good!!"
73,The Shape of Water,1,14 January 2018,Avoid at all costs,"I WAS a big del toro fan until I saw this dross. It is so transparently racially and gender political that I had to turn it off despite investing almost 2 hours in it, a rarity for me to be so appalled.It's nothing to do with an open mind, this movie depicts a typical working class white male with a nuclear family as the ultimate villain whilst a mute outcast consummates with a living fish man.Also depicts another working class white male as a villain, who turns down the advances of a gay man old enough to be his grandfather in a scene where he is also suddenly revealed to be a racist. Of course, if you don't want to have anal sex with your grandad, you must by definition also be an evil racist.What a crime in general it is to be a white male taxpayer these days. The movie is utterly offensive. The plot is straightforward and linear.The only redeeming quality is Michael Shannon's performance as the evil white man, another actor of who I am a big fan. However I'm not sure I can respect, enjoy or watch him anymore after his willingness to participate in this utter dross."
74,The Shape of Water,9,14 January 2018,the shape of a good movie,"Guillermo del Toro shows why many consider him an excellent director, the film is wonderful as a dark reinvention of the story of the beauty and the beast gives it its touch of originality, it makes an inter-species relationship that feels attachment so real and beautiful his characters and this is thanks to the excellent performance of Sally Hawkins and his chemistry with Doug Jones show that acting goes beyond immense dialogues and that emotions through our expressions and sign language do not limit us to understand the feeling that surrounds us each scene, also the actors like Michael Shannon who plays an excellent role, Octavia Spencer who recently did an Gifted and shows how talented he is and Richard Jenkins also does a great job, the music of Alexandre Desplat using classical music to set the mood according to the moments that are happening throughout the film and the photograph of Dan Laustsen just beautiful who had already I worked with del Toro on Crimson Peak and mimic , but despite the fact that I loved the movie there is only one but I could put it and it is the manipulator that is with the protagonists and I mean is that each of the characters are forced too to love them or to feel sympathy for them or even to feel hatred for them, it is as if they were marked with a sign saying that he is good, he is bad, he is innocent that comes to feel forced at the time of seeing this film, outside of that the film is incredible both visual, and narrative (except for that detail) is definitely a melodrama with fantasy that you must see."
75,The Shape of Water,10,13 January 2018,Beautiful love story on many levels,"Everything about this movie is beautiful! The acting, cinematography, story line,
music, and emotions. I loved this movie! It touches on emotions felt deeply...and the cruelty and kindness of man. However, not all may feel this from the movie. As much as I loved it, my husband did not. He is a realist and could not see beyond the fantasy.. I cannot wait to watch it again!!"
76,The Shape of Water,7,13 January 2018,Enjoyable...Predictable,"The movie is enjoyable. Michael Shannon was great. Yet we all know what will happen anyway through out the movie.
A LOT of nudity and sex scenes with no obvious need actually. Could have worked more on the relationship between the girl and the shape.
Cinematography is great.. Music was great."
77,The Shape of Water,1,13 January 2018,One of the worst movies,"What did I just see? This is one of the worst movies. The high ratings are totally misleading. The moment it turned to a sexual relationship between the lady and the alien, the whole plot was lost. Totally gross. A Stupid, senseless movie and trust me it will get to your nerves. Skip this."
78,The Shape of Water,9,13 January 2018,Strange but very interesting,"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie! Visually it is amazing; a masterpiece of direction from Guillermo Del Toro. Lots of interesting things to look at, it's quite beautiful.The romance is very strange. It's the centerpiece of the film, I guess, and it works well enough. Ironically it is my least favorite part of the movie, there is no personality for the water guy, it falls flat for me. Everything else works great, though, especially the characters. The neighbor, co-worker and villain are all fantastic. As with most Del Toro films, there is some disturbing stuff here. I wanted to look away a few times. The contrast between horror and beauty is pretty interesting here."
79,The Shape of Water,8,12 January 2018,"Solid, beautiful movie with good script and acting","Another very satisfying GDT movie, very reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth. Lots of the technical aspects, such as score, makeup of Doug Jones, scene shooting and cuts, and acting performances of Hawkins and Jenkins, were really impressive and help explain why it's got a good chance at Best Picture. I really like the themes they touch on, with the Cold War, love and understanding, loyalty and hierarchy, and very clearly defined and developed characters. However, I didn't find these themes to be extremely deeply or consistently explored, as none of them are especially vivid, emphasized, or concluded in a way that makes you reconsider the idea - they were smaller pieces to a beautiful movie about the main character finding love and understanding. Nothing wrong with that, and it was well done, but nothing that makes it especially memorable or emotionally intense. Very solid, well-directed, and good peripherals, but nothing that puts it over the top."
80,The Shape of Water,8,12 January 2018,Different and enjoyable love story,"'The Shape of Water' is del Toro's 10th film, and one of his best - better than 'Pan's Labyrinth', in my books. It's an interesting tale about a mute woman Elisa (Hawkins), who works as a cleaner at a military base with her friend, Zelda (Spencer). There they find that Strickland (Shannon) has brought something strange back to the base. Since he's shown in the trailer & posters, it's not really a spoiler to say that Doug Jones plays an Abe Sapien-like creature (man, I wish they'd make 'Hellboy III'!) Elisa and ""the asset"" begin to connect and we're off on a peculiar journey.The film does well to integrate the fantastic with the real world, with everything looking like the 1960's and the racism, sexism and prejudice is still on display. There's also an interesting sub-plot of the Cold War, with Russian spies - and a bit of a sad ending there, but also slyly funny. All the actors are great - Jenkins as the helpful friend/neighbour, Spencer as the chatty/funny work friend, Stuhlbarg as the scientist, Shannon as the bad guy - always excellent - and Jones and Hawkins as the silent, but super-expressive leads.The other main stars are colour and water - everything's either a motif of green, blue or teal, and the use of water as a transition between scenes is great. The score's good and the film never seems hurried - except for one scene - but isn't too long either. There's moments of violence and comedy between the question of how does he exist? But mostly, it's a pleasant story about love and identity, with a solid ending and excellent cinematography."
81,The Shape of Water,8,12 January 2018,Beautiful Movie,"This beautiful and very clever movie will not be for everyone, but if you are prepared to suspend your disbelief it really is a lot of fun (I see from other reviews that not everyone did this). Sally Hawkins is fantastic (I've loved everything she's been in recently) and Michael Shannon is the perfect stereotyped bad guy. The story is simplistic, sure, but the sets and the cinematography are the real stars here. If you've played the video game ""BioShock"" then a lot of it will look familiar. If you're a fan of Guillermo Del Toro and enjoy all genres of movies (including, but not limited to, science fiction, romance, musical) you may well ""get"" this movie, otherwise you should probably skip it. Even if you do enjoy it, there are a few noticeable sub-plots and themes that don't really go anywhere (Richard Jenkins' character being a gay man in the 50s, for example) ... my only gripe.Go watch it, have fun. But leave your brain at home."
82,The Shape of Water,9,12 January 2018,A Beautiful Masterpiece,"Honestly, this film is Del Toro's best piece. While the plot sounds completely absurd, Del Toro executes it perfectly to make a weird and quite frankly strange piece turn into an amazing romantic story. With the beautiful cinematography and magical 50's theme, The Shape of Water combines a variety of themes from love and acceptance to bravery and self worth. The soundtrack in this movie is phenomenal, and Del Toro's choice in old songs fit the movie so well in unexpected ways. The only thing that threw me off was the black and white dancing and singing between the amphibian man and Elisa. I still do not know what I feel about it. On one hand, it felt very out of place and different from the tone of the rest of the film, yet at the same time, the short scene added a sense of fantasy and romance into the film that made it so jarring but interesting to watch.Overall, I loved the movie and would highly recommend it."
83,The Shape of Water,10,12 January 2018,"Whether intended or not, this is 'Blackie's' long overdue update/tribute","It's very rare for me to push 'play' with no expectation of disappointment.
Certainly I was biased going in. I've been waiting for Sally Hawkins to score and I knew choosing to cast her was no fluke.
Nothing made by mankind is perfect, but that's no reason not to try. This is one of the most 'as perfectly as can be' thought out, planned and executed works of art, cinematic or not, I've experienced.
There's too much good in every department, on every level, to list here/now.Whether intended or not, this is 'Blackie's' long overdue update/tribute"
84,The Shape of Water,8,12 January 2018,Speechless,"I love the films directed by Guillermo del Toro, so I was waiting for The Shape of Water.
We follow the story of a woman who falls in love with a strange aquatic creature, during the 60s. We also have an amazing cinematography, a great cast and some good subplots full of metaphors about racism, homosexuality, patriotism and male chauvinism during that decade. That's one of the things I loved more.I didn't hate anything about this movie, but there are some points that could be better, as: the main antagonist, he's just stupid and weak if I compare him with the sadistic and scary Captain Vidal from Pan's Labyrinth. I liked the main creature it but I missed the typical mystery and charisma that we can appreciate in some Del Toro's monsters.The Shape of Water isn't the best movie from one of the most amazing directors of all time, but stills good and perhaps one of the best movies of the year.Rating 7.5/10"
85,The Shape of Water,10,11 January 2018,The Shape of Water is magical,The Shape of Water is a magical movie that will take your breth away. The acting is supurb. I loved how the movie went from English to American Sign Language then to Russian i thought that was really neat. The costumes were wonderfully done. I highly recomend this movie to any moviegoer. This movie is very different then any other movie out there.Parents this movie is rated R
86,The Shape of Water,8,11 January 2018,Breathtaking movie with a heartwarming love story!,"If I told you about her, what would I say? That they lived happily ever after? I believe they did. That they were in love? That they remained in love? I'm sure that's true. But when I think of her.. of Elisa.. the only thing that comes to mind is a poem whispered by someone in love hundreds of years ago. Unable to perceive the shape of you, I find you all around me, your presence fills my eyes with your love! It humbles my heart, for you are everywhere! 
This films was 2 hours of my life that will never ever be repeated. A stunning love story of a lonely woman who falls in love with a sea monster. A love so true, so humble, so rare, so uneasy and yet so beautiful! Two God's creatures find themselves falling in love, this is a story of a magical and real love under unreal circumstances. I'm so touched and so emotional that words are hard to describe, but they come flowing. 
This is an adult fairytale that will take you into a great adventure. This film is for dreams and anyone in love can relate to it. 
Winner of 2 Golden Globes for best directing and score by Alexander Desplat, this movie is definitelt worth watching! It will take your breath away!"
87,The Shape of Water,6,3 January 2018,A flawless story but slow and boring at times.,"The Shape of Water shows Guillermo del Toro visionary direction of a tale that is a love story with a bit of fantasy. The film does well with its storytelling, interesting characters, the concept of a creature that looks like it came out of Creature from the Black Lagoon falling for a mute girl. Guillermo del Toro script does well with its storytelling. A girl falling in love with a sea creature. Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute girl that works at a factory that is mostly kept secret with the experiments done within the facility. Elisa goes day by day, waking up and being lonely, she even has a set timer for her self fun time, and she works and after spending time with her lonely neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins). Giles is obsessed with key lime pies that he keeps in his fridge, which is a lot of pies that he saves for later. And also has an apartment filled with cats. Then, Elisa notices Richard (Michael Shannon) and his secret government project he needs to hide in their facility which is a humanoid sea creature. Elisa becomes friends with the creature by feeding it eggs during her lunch breaks and notices the creature is not the threat they all assume. Richard trying to figure out what it is before the soviets try to steal their specimen away. Elisa helps breaks the creature free and falls for the creature. What I like about the film is it does have a visionary tale. And del Toro always does it best. Every character is distinct and different. Sally Hawkins is a mute girl and sweet and charming with her performance. You can't help but to love her performance. Michael Shannon is addicted to painkillers and racist and becomes very nasty as the villain. A colonel that wants to get the job done by any means necessary. Richard Jenkins was good as a crazy cat man and obsessed with his key lime pie that tries to be friends with the waiter at a diner. Octavia Spencer is good as Elisa's friend. And Doug Jones as the amphibian man, if it was visual effects or practical make up work. It was well done. The concept was neat as it plays in the 1960s. The time were the soviets was on the trail of trying to steal the americans amphibian creature. And also the fear of spies within the facility. What I did not like about the film is the plot is slow moving. Which can be boring at times. Seeing Elisa go through her day-to-day routines can be repetitive and boring. Also, there is one weird musical scene that just took the tone and direction away from the movie. When Elisa and the Amphibian are on the dining room and she burst into an imaginary musical sequence was cheesy and weird. Overall, The Shape of Water was a fair fantasy drama film."
88,The Shape of Water,,23 December 2017,"Beautiful, yet disappointing.","I agree with the few here who have said that The Shape of Water is good, even very good, but somehow it doesn't reach greatness. Although I can pinpoint why that is. The film is very well directed, but it's working with a screenplay that is perhaps simplistic and dare I say it, pedestrian. The film should have been anything but unremarkable, but that's how so much of it felt. The romance at its core was too quickly developed for my liking, causing it to feel like the film was just going through the motions instead of stopping to let us bask in its magic. In addition to being very unremarkable, the screenplay is also filled with some questionable storylines and some unimpressive, if even dry dialogue. Visually it's on point, although I would disagree that the film's cinematography is anywhere near that of something like Blade Runner 2049, which is unfortunate because it could very well win that Oscar. The score is also very nice, although again it should have been so much more memorable. The acting is definitely the best part of it. Sally Hawkins is luminous, and although I'm not sure I would rank her as being better than McDormand and Ronan (for Three Billboards and Lady Bird respectively, all three vying for the Oscar) it's an impressive performance that is deeply heartfelt. The other biggest surprise is Richard Jenkins, who lights up every scene he is in. Stuhlbarg is fine, and Shannon is disappointing. The latter is such a talented actor, but he can only do so much with such a one-note character (again, the screenplay's fault).Overall, it's worth it but in a pool of much more impressive award contenders like Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name, and The Florida Project, it's a film that could have been so much more."
89,The Shape of Water,6,23 December 2017,Sci-Fi Romance,"I saw ""The Shape of Water"", starring Sally Hawkins-Paddington, Godzilla_2014; Michael Shannon-Nocturnal Animals, Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice; Richard Jenkins-Kong:Skull Island, Step Brothers and Octavia Spencer-Hidden Figures, Snowpiercer.
This is a sci-fi romantic movie that is written & directed by Guillermo del Toro-Pacific Rim, Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy. It's set in the 1960's when the cold war was going full speed. Sally is a mute janitor-she can hear but not speak-that works at a research facility with Octavia. Michael is a man that captured an aquatic creature in the jungles of the Amazon and has brought it to the facility to have it researched. FYI: The creature looks kind of like the creature from the black lagoon, only more detailed. Michael wants to dissect the creature and find out what makes him tick. Sally befriends the creature-she even teaches it sign language-and wants to save it so she enlists her neighbor and close friend, Richard, along with her co-worker, Octavia to pull off an Ocean's Eleven. There is also a side-plot about the Russians wanting to get their hands on the creature, too-remember, it's the cold war. The creature looks great-he reminded me of Abe Sapien from Hellboy and in fact, the same actor played both parts, Doug Jones-but the story just didn't cut the mustard with me. I could have used more action and less romance.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes.
It's not one that I'd buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental."
90,The Shape of Water,10,16 October 2017,Artistic giant. Best movie of the decade...it's that good.🌟👍🏽,"""The Shape of Water"" is an artistic giant. Best movie of the decade...it's that good. From its opening images to its last frame del Toro weaves a multi-dimensional feast for the eyes, ears, heart and mind. A magical love story that plays your heart-strings with the kind of creativity a fantastic dream might unfold without the constraints of plausible segues or limits from physical reality. Yet, del Toro weaves such multidimensional elements delightfully and seamlessly. Images and music present implausible suggestions that brighten heart-mind connections like a drug that just kicked in. After feeling joyfully uplifted in one piece of amazing synthesis next you find yourself writhing in horror from human cruelty, until the next surprising turn. ""The Shape of Water"" will be a timeless classic and winner of many awards. People will see this movie multiple times and feel delighted, horrified, and amazed each time."
91,The Shape of Water,9,1 December 2017,An Unexpectedly Great Film,"I never had the intentions of watching this film, but to my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed the film And it is a film worth watching. Without spoiling anything here is a film that gives you a realization of a world we live in. The one question that echoed through the film was ""Who am I?"" It is a story of love with a humanoid creature and a human being. They touch on subjects of mistreatment simply because someone or something is different. The film makes an emphasis on how it doesn't matter who we are on the inside or what we look like on the outside it's that your feelings are true to yourself. The character arc of the Amphibian Man is a seat clincher one moment you're scared he's going to bite and the next you're hoping he does bite. It is amazing how much can be said by a character who uses sign language to speak. It is an honest film that even if you aren't there for the the story it is a pleasure enjoying the music and the art that it is."
92,The Shape of Water,6,8 January 2018,"Even Though Del Toro is a Master Story Teller, I could Not Like This Movie","Guillermo del Toro (the maker of HELLBOY) is such an amazing director, film maker and story teller.. and I so much tried to like The Shape of Water. But I couldn't, It's just simple didn't click with me. I love the Beauty and The Best. 
 and I like the ET. But this is not in that level of beauty (to me). Yes, I like, Guillermo's Hellboy, and I was hoping some chemistry here. But none whatsoever. The acting was great. All characters did their part and the story is not that bad. But that monster was simply to horrible. I know that the ultimate message is that love can be found regardless of the physical looks of a person, which the character Eliza did. The idea is nice and even the production set a feel of the 60's. but at the end of the day I could not like this film. I much appreciate the effort of Guillermo. He is brilliant and a really nice guy. But this movie I could not love.I hope Guillermo could make more normal movies. For him It always have to be monsters?I gave a 6 out of 10. and congratulations to Guillermo for his Golden Glove Best Director Award. What a talent"
93,The Shape of Water,6,4 January 2018,The Shape of Del Toro's Mind,"I'll say this: Mr. Del Toro can make a cinematic experience memorable. I don't know any director who can craft a film in such an exquisite manner and at the same time inject revolting and mind numbing scenes of vulgarity and violence leaving you to ponder the point of it all.In Pan's Labyrinth this combination worked to make a point about self sacrifice and mercy in an ugly world. Hellboy was strictly for entertainment and laughs. I enjoyed both, but for different reasons.But in the Shape of Water, there is a different paradigm in play. While played ultimately as a fantasy, Del Toro makes it morally and ethically acceptable for a woman to express concern and mercy for another species by... mating with it? Perhaps the only reason this is remotely okay is because the creature is intelligent and has the ability to converse through sign language, and it has the shape of a humanoid. I do believe apes fit this description, too.But, as I say, this is a fantasy and so it must play out as a weird and unusual love story. One where even a plain Jane mute with only a homosexual middle age man for a close friend can find herself as attractive, as long as it is with a fish-amphib- man.The premise, as I make it out to be, falls more than a bit flat since you must not only suspend disbelief but your natural inclination to find only those of your own species as suitable mates. Asking us to do both at the same time in the name of what - tolerance, diversity? - is more than most can take.So in this sense, Del Toro goes where no man has gone before and makes a beautifully crafted and repulsive movie wrapped in the same container. I'll give it a hesitant nod toward the positive only because the attempt at high mindedness is laudable, though regrettable in the manner of its execution on screen."
94,The Shape of Water,,4 January 2018,Adult fairy tale,"One of the most hauntingly erotic scenes of 50s cinema is the suggestive underwater pas de deux between Julie Adams and Ricou Browning (as the Gill Man) in CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. Director Gillermo del Toro's THE SHAPE OF WATER was obviously inspired by that image when he conceived of his Adult Fairy Tale. And, adult it is, minutes in Sally Hawkins (Elisa) strips full frontal naked and masturbates in a bathtub. Message: Leave the kiddies at home.
Elisa works at a mysterious government facility where a creature from the Amazon has been taken. Credited as Amphibian Man (Doug Jones in a superb full body costume with some CGI touches), the creature is under the watchful eye of stern Richard (Michael Shannon), while also being experimented on by Dr. ""Bob"" Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg). Elisa is mute, and her only friends appear to be a co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and a lonely man in her building, Giles (Richard Jenkins). Elisa bonds with the Amphibian Man (think a distaff mermaid fantasy). When it becomes obvious to Elisa (and Dr. Hoffstetler) that the government has bad intentions for the monster, a conspiracy is hatched to save the beast.
In outline form, this all works very nicely. And, the Beauty and the Beast story-line is lyrically performed. Unfortunately, del Toro and co-writer Vanessa Taylor layer on a lot of layers - and, not all for the better. The movie is set in the early-60s in order to play off of Cold War tensions with the Russians. It gives the movie some obvious villains, and, setting it long ago adds to Elisa's fairy tale fate.But, Shannon's Richard isn't just a tough security supervisor, but, a sexual deviant, bigot and a psychopath. Sure, in 1962 there was racism but, what does it really add to the movie to have a lunch counter scene (at one point Zelda is even referred to as ""The Help"" (I'm not kidding))? They toss in sexual prejudice and physical disabilities discrimination for good measure. Yes, the point is that Elisa, Zelda, ""Bob"" and Giles are outsiders, and therefore they are the only ones that can ""understand"" the monster. It's not so much the symbolism but the inelegance and heavy-handedness of how it's presented that is at issue here. Most crucially, it detracts from the core story.Hawkins is a wonderful actress. The mute may be a bit of a cliche in these kinds of stories, but she gives it a soulfulness that is entrancing. Jenkins and Spencer are reliably sturdy, but, Stuhlbarg (also fine in the current CALL ME BY YOUR NAME) is quite exceptional presenting the duality of his role as ""Bob"". Shannon is one of our most commanding actors, but his part isn't written (or directed) with much finesse. He dominates the picture, rather than supports it. As noted, the makeup is excellent, and the other effects are subtle but effective. Alexander Splat's music is sweet, but, sometimes it doesn't gel with the harshness of the scenes it's played against. Dan Austen's photography is excellent.THE SHAPE OF WATER is decent, but flawed. I have no particular issue with an R-Rated fantasy, but, here it doesn't seem necessary - or relevant. We've all seen more wholesome Beauty & The Beast/Mermaid stories before (astute genre viewers will also see homages to King Kong and other films). And, the essential base of the story with Elisa IS quite sweet. But, other than the frank nudity, all the other R-Rated elements are side points (cursing, gore and a gratuitous sex scene with Richard that only is there to highlight one particular fetish). Movies like UNDER THE SKIN and Almodovar's THE SKIN I LIVE IN were steeped in mature themes and imagery that were integral to their core, but, in SHAPE they seem extraneous. Hawkins and Amphibian Man make for a charming daydream, too bad its too often woken by interruptions."
95,The Shape of Water,1,10 January 2018,"This is open rebellion to God, which leads to open war.","This movie is in open rebellion to God, and open rebellion always leads to open war. Oh, and trust me, no one wins against God.This movie is Sata-ic. It has the gay, the malformed, and the black fight against the hard working white Christian so that the malformed can commit unnatural acts of bestiality. And don't forget! These people are working with the Russians in the time of the Cold War, AGAINST America, the land that God blessed. Not only that, but the fish takes ""two mortal blows, and comes back to life""... This is exactly what the Bible tells us about the Beast, being Sata-. The fish Beast ends up killing the Christian male, oh, which by the way would never say that the fish was a god, being that he is a Christian and all Christians know that.This movie has done so many things wrong, I don't even think I could list it out in 3 sittings. This is by far the worst movie I have ever watched, as it rebels against ALL Christian ethics."
96,The Shape of Water,7,19 December 2017,Oddly Beautiful,"The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's latest blend of fantasy mysticism and gritty realism. Set around 1960, Sally Hawkins stars as a mute janitor at a research facility who falls in love with a creature that they pulled from the Amazon. This is beautifully played over a cold war backdrop with outstanding supporting performances, like Octavia Spencer as the sassy coworker, Michael Shannon as the sadistic boss, and Richard Jenkins as her struggling neighbor. It is firmly reminiscent of Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, without feeling too similar.There were several moments when it dipped into being unnecessarily crude for a few cheap laughs that felt out of place. They also took her relationship with the creature to a place that kind of undermined the beauty of it and weakened the film as a whole. Del Toro definitely played into the R rating by diverting a touching love story to places that didn't help develop it.The Shape of Water is Del Toro's best work since Pan's Labyrinth and features beautiful cinematography and very strong work by the entire cast. However, it never manages to break through into being a truly great film despite showing the potential."
97,The Shape of Water,6,11 December 2017,Sally Hawkins engrosses in del Toro's Ambitious yet Predictable Fantasy Drama!,"Guillermo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' is visually dazzling & impeccably acted by Sally Hawkins. And sadly enough, its also predictable. While there is much to admire here, especially its technical aspects, its also a bit underwhelming how one can predict the entire film ahead. But del Toro is in form here and that enough makes up for its flaws.'The Shape of Water' synopsis: In a 1960s research facility, a mute janitor (Sally Hawkins) forms a relationship with an aquatic creature (Doug Jones).'The Shape of Water' is del Toro's love letter to cinema, as he said, so there is a beautiful Broadway dance here, along-with a love-story that tugs your heartstrings. There is genuine romance here between the mute woman & the aquatic creature. del Toro makes sure he keeps the narrative like a fantasy & the beauty remains intact in its characters & in the water.On the downside, is a tiresomely one-note villain, played by Michael Shannon, the wicked Colonel who tortures the Creature, even after he gets two of his fingers ripped apart. The antagonist is predictably a racist & misogynist, who only lives by orders & has no heart to speak of. del Toro tries to make Shannon's bad-guy human, but he barely remains anything but a regular villain in a film where you're suppose to be on the creature's side. And it doesn't help that Shannon, an otherwise brilliant actor, goes over-the-top.Another minus in this beautiful looking motion-picture, is the predictable story-line. You know where this is headed right from the word GO. And while some of it is genuinely interesting & offers heart, there is no denying its clichéd form. And the strong violence puts you off after a point.And despite the minuses that cannot be overlooked, the pluses still remain unmistakably powerful. del Toro's Direction is dreamlike & takes us into its world of picturesque beauty & gruesome violence. del Toro is in his element here & proves once again that he's among the most passionate filmmakers of our times, despite none of his films being perfect. Dan Laustse's Magnificent Cinematography, Alexandre Desplat's enchanting Score, Sidney Wolinsky's nicely done Editing, along-with extraordinary work on the Art & Costume Design, only add to the narrative's merits.Performance-Wise: Sally Hawkins is engrossing in her portrayal of the mute protagonist, who falls in love with a creature. Hawkins is pure heart & soul, fleshed out in a sublime performance. Hawkins leads 'The Shape of Water' with her astounding performance. Expect strong Oscar chase! Of the rest of the cast, Doug Jones does a splendid job as the creature. Richard Jenkins as Hawkins' neighbor, as always, is perfect. Octavia Spencer raises the best laughs as Hawkins' co-worker & friend, while Michael Stuhlbarg excels as a doctor who believes in freeing the creature from the sadists around him. On the whole, 'The Shape of Water' isn't perfect, but there's no denying its beauty or its strong leading woman."
98,The Shape of Water,8,10 December 2017,"Enchanting fantasy romance, full of wonder","Although far from flawless, Del Toro's fantasy drama about a mute woman and her unexpected romance with a creature captured from the Amazon by the U.S. government is endearing and sad at the same time. It's a story about two members of divergent species who meet one another by chance and develop a romantic spark. These two beings come to find solace and bliss in each other's company in a world that is cold and heartless. It's a more modern spin on ""Beauty and the Beast"" and it's well worth seeing.The biggest stumbling block the film has to overcome is a claustrophobic feeling that settles in after a certain point. The trailers made this look like a great adventure, but it's actually a desperate fight for survival against daunting odds, but one that is riveting. The film is beautifully shot, has a sterling throwback soundtrack and a beguiling storyline milieu. The creature itself is not depicted as a soft cuddly thing at all times, refreshingly. In some instances, it can be quite menacing. Del Toro's realization of this monster-cum-paramour is both wondrous and complex.Sally Hawkins is utterly splendid as the mute woman who works in a smallish maintenance position at the government facility where the creature is quarantined. Michael Shannon is well-deployed as the government official who views the creature as nothing more than an experiment to be learned from. Michael Stuhlberg is also effective as one of the chief scientists at the lab. And Octavia Spencer, as always, is fun to watch here. The only weak link is Richard Jenkins as Hawkins' neighbor. There's something annoyingly saccharine about his performance and the film winds up having to overcome it, which it does.There might be some larger metaphors in this film about race and religion, but I would leave that open to interpretation. This is a poignant story in its own right, and one that will stay with you, regardless of what else Del Toro might be trying to say. Gladly recommended."
99,The Shape of Water,8,7 December 2017,"beautiful film, creature, performances","Greetings again from the darkness. Recent release THE JUSTICE LEAGUE is filled with superheroes, but filmmaker-extraordinaire Guillermo del Toro finds his league of misfits and outcasts to be much more interesting - as do I. The numerous possible descriptions of this movie are all accurate, yet alone, each falls short: a fairy tale, fable, monster movie, unconventional romance, sci-fi, cold war saga, and commentary on societal misfits. What is also true is that it's a gorgeous film with terrific performances, and it pays lovely tribute to the classics. A government research facility in 1962 Baltimore is the setting, and ""The Asset"" being secured and studied is an amphibious creature that was captured in South America by a sadistic Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) and his electric cattle prod. Now the military, and a 5- star General played by Nick Searcy, is in charge. The lead scientist played by Michael Stuhlbarg certainly has a different agenda than the military, whose focus seems to be more on preventing the Russians (closer than you think) from stealing the asset than in actually seizing the rare scientific opportunity for advancement.While all the ominous and clandestine government operations are being conducted, a member of the nighttime cleaning crew - a mute woman named Elisa (Sally Hawkins)  makes a very personal connection with the creature through nutritious snacks, Big Band music and sign language. This is the enchanting portion of the story and is admittedly (by del Toro) inspired by the 1954 classic CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (a personal favorite of mine). Elisa and the creature experience a romantic courtship not unlike what we have seen in many other love stories  that is, if you overlook the amphibious being that makes up half of this couple. In fact, ""going with"" the story is crucial to one's enjoyment. Sit back and let the magic and wonder and fantastical nature of del Toro's imagination sweep you away  just as it has done for Elisa.There are many elements of the film worth exploring, and it's likely to take another viewing to capture many of them. The band of misfits is comprised of the creature (Doug Jones), Elisa (Ms. Hawkins), Elisa's wise and wise-cracking co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer), and Elisa's neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins), a closeted gay graphics design artist. These are the nice folks/beings who make up the world that seems to be run by bullies and predators (sound familiar?). There is even a religious debate here as it's mentioned that the creature was treated by a God in his natural environment, and a brief discussion is had over what might a God look like. All of the actors are superb, and Miss Hawkins delivers her second knockout performance of the year (the other being MAUDIE).""The future"" is a central theme of the story, though Elisa is most focused on now  how to find some happiness in a world that has been so challenging. Elisa realizes she and the creature are more similar than not, and she feels his pain each time the power-hungry Strickland (Shannon) pops him with the electric cattle prod. There is an ethereal beauty (and yes, sensuality) to the scenes with Elisa and the creature, and it even leads to a terrific song (""You'll Never Know"" by Renee Fleming) and dance dream sequence. In addition, you'll notice many nods and tributes to classics such as Mr. Ed, Dobie Gillis, Betty Grable, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson and Shirley Temple, and Carmen Miranda singing ""Chica Chica Boom Chic"". It's also no accident that the apartments of Elisa and Giles are located directly above a palatial old movie theatre that is struggling to make ends meet. All of these pieces are tied together as Mr. del Toro honors the art forms he so adores.For those who enjoy such detail, it should be noted that the color green plays a huge role throughout the film  the water, the creature, the uniforms, the furniture, the walls  even the Jello, the pie and Strickland's (teal) Cadillac. The use of color ties in the ever- present mythology, and the theme of meanness and power versus kindness and love.Cinematographer Dan Laustsen adds to the magical feel with his camera work and lighting that perfectly complements the characters and tone. Oscar winning composer Alexandre Desplat delivers yet another spot on score that not only syncs with story, but also the numerous classic songs included. Guillermo det Toro is one of the most creative and inventive contemporary filmmakers, and though this one may fall a tick below his masterpiece PAN'S LABRYNTH, it is sure to dazzle and mesmerize those who give it a chance  and let's hope there are many who do!"
100,The Shape of Water,10,10 December 2017,"🍷 🍕 Sunday, March 4, 2018...and the Best Picture goes to The Shape of Water!","Are you a movie fanatic?Are you a movie lover?Are you a hopeless romantic?Are you a dreamer?Do you enjoy films that clearly define good versus evil?Do you wish to inspire our youth to do great things?The Shape of Water is the fulfillment of all these inspirational beliefs. The scenery brings us back to a past time in our lives when life was simpler and hidden secrets were in abundance. The screenplay was written by Guillermo del Toro and Vanessa Taylor. Their screenplay is both creative and at the same time haunting. The cast was perfectly matched. Sally Hawkins plays Elisa Esposito a mute cleaning lady whose partner at work is none other than 2012 Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer who plays cleaning lady Zelda Fuller. These two ladies clean all day mopping up urine from the men's bathroom floor at a government run top secret facility in Baltimore. After work, they go home where Zelda cooks and cleans for her lazy no good husband, and Elisa spends her evenings alone in her bathtub pleasuring herself to the beat of an egg timer.Then in walks Richard Strickland (played menacingly and true to form by Michael Shannon) with his 3 foot electric prodding cane, and a water contraption that contains some type of amphibious creature that can swim and live in both salt water and stand upright on dry land. Richard Strickland brings this strange beast to the Baltimore facility for scientists such as actor Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Doctor Robert Hoffstetler can study and examine the beast.One very interesting character that I cannot fail to mention is actor Richard Jenkins who plays Giles, Elisa's co-tenant who both live upstairs from the local Orpheum theater. Giles character is lonely, he is a gay man, a commercial artist with great talent, but apparently without a bright future due to some previous drinking problem. Giles friendship with the mute Elisa is sincere and loving as they both are two lonely individuals looking for something more from life. Richard Jenkins character Giles, has some of the best one-liners I have heard in a long time. One such one liner was ""don't play with the cats"". You will have to see this wonderful film to appreciate Giles hilarious and timely comments.When Elisa has an opportunity to meet the amphibious creature while cleaning the facility she immediately forms a bond with the creature. They communicate by hand gestures and by heart felt facial expressions which eventually lead to a romantic relationship. Michael Shannon's role as Richard Strickland is a take no prisoners type of character and he plays a despised overseer of the creature who punishes the creature at will and for his own pleasure. Elisa realizes that if she does not react quickly to free the creature from his captivity he will surely die at the insistence and obstinate hand of Richard Strickland. So we the audience are kept in suspense on how will the meek and mild mute cleaning lady Elisa who has affection for the creature successfully save the creature?I felt the escape plan was executed with great suspense and curiosity and contained some of the best scenes by writer/director Guillermo del Toro's vision that I would be surprised if this film does not win at least six (6) Academy Awards on Sunday March 04th, 2018, Oscar night.Mrs Shullivan and I loved the film, and we were fortunate to be able to see the film with son number 2 and his set dresser girlfriend who contributed in making many of the films scenes so beautifully crafted and matched to both the musical score and the characters constant interactions that also happened to keep a full house of movie lovers in awe of your next Best Picture for 2018 winner.A perfect 10 for 10 score!"
101,The Shape of Water,10,2 December 2017,'The Creature From The Black Lagoon' meets 'Amelie' ; one of the year's best films.,"THE SHAPE OF WATER (2017) **** Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, Michael Stuhlbarg, Nick Searcy, David Hewlett. 'The Creature From The Black Lagoon' meets 'Amelie' could've been the pitch for this romantic sci-fi offering from filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (who co-wrote with Vanessa Taylor) about a lonely, mute cleaning woman (Hawkins continuing to make smart decisions in a truly remarkable career thus far) for a top secret government lab circa 1962 where she finds an unlikely soulmate - an amphibious man-like creature (Jones doing wonders in motion capture ballet) that has been captured and taken from the swamps of South America to Baltimore for further observation and study. Del Toro balances fantasy, horror and genuine dramatic pathos wonderfully with dexterity in blending his odd couple into one amazing study of the concept of communication via love. Spencer adds strong and fun support as Hawkins' co-worker, BFF as well as Jenkins as her gay, commercial artist next-door neighbor but it is Shannon who stands out as the villainous and odious security lead to the operation whose racist, sexist, bullying jerk has subtle shades of grey bubbling underneath the surface - which best could also describe this superb film. Outstanding production design by Paul D. Austerberry, Nigel Churcher's varying hues of eerie and ethereally themed greens add punch with art direction, a sublimely romantic score by Alexander Desplat and handsome cinematography by Dan Laustsen prove a joint effort by all involved. One of the year's best films."
102,The Shape of Water,8,16 January 2018,Year's Most Original Love Story,"Let's face it one of the most artistic, visual, imaginative Directors alive and working today in Hollywood is Guillermo Del Toro.A CV with Pan's Labyrinth, Crimson Peak, Hellboy and Pacific Rim is definitely going to get your attention and defiantly make you wonder what a director/writer like that is going to concoct next.... well look no further for The Shape Of Water has arrived.The story set in the 60s follows a lonely mute Elisa (Sally Hawkins) who whilst working as a cleaner at secret government Area 51 style facility comes starts to slowly form a bond with a underwater creature that has just arrived to be experimented on under the watchful eye of violent, paranoid, unstable government agent Strickland (Micheal Shannon).The films spins a highly original fairytale yarn that pulls the audience on a journey of the years most unexpected love stories.The script negotiates multiple genres, moods and themes in order to carefully unfold the story through its generous two hour running time.Care and attention to details has been employed here to really justify any choice our characters make by giving all involved real features, flaws and frailties that isn't always the case in many films.The cast lead by Sally Hawkins are on top form clearly making the most of the script Shannon shines as the deeply troubled flawed government agent, Octavia Spencer hot of Hidden Figures performs charismatically as the best friend and Richard Jenkins lavishes his diverse character journey he goes on.Nicely and neatly shot but certainly not as trade mark stunning say as Crimson Peak the director navigates this film with the experienced skill that comes with his twenty plus years experience and shows us here that risks can certainly still be made. And worth the gamble.Whilst the film may not be for everyone, a highly engaging, entertaining and original modern day fairy tale love story like this should prove that originality like romance is not dead."
103,The Shape of Water,10,16 January 2018,Simply wonderful!,"Breathtaking, fluid and wonderful. I really enjoyed the movie and would certainly recommend it. The thing that fascinated me the most and let me get immersed into the movie was the way it was shot and how everything was set up. Of course all the actors were amazing and by the end of the movie I actually felt like being there in the movie seeing the whole story unravel and feeling the feelings characters felt."

I now have another film to add to my favourites list.Recommended but I know you will either love or hate this film. Rating 10 out of 10"

However, after watching it, it was a huge let down for me...of course, the concept could be wonderful but the characters were not developed to the level it should be....I feel like i want something more..."
108,The Shape of Water,1,14 January 2018,What happened Del Toro??,"I am a huge fan of Pan's labyrinth and El Orfanato movies by Del Toro, both were breathtaking with full on melodramatic feelings with a mix of fantasy and horror, that always make you cry in the end.
From the grades this Shape of Water had in imdb, (and apparently there is a bunch of fake reviewers paid by someone lastly on imdb) I was expecting something close to the 2 previous movies, alas...
-The story itself is a huge ''deja vu'' of an alien/monster/ but good that is tracked down by the army and hidden by ''friends''. Taken by Spielberg is a great example.
-The Music: Well while it was perhaps the most affecting factor in the 2 Del Toro movies I mentioned before, that make you cry in the end, in this Shape of Water it's totally weird and non-sense, it's like if Del Toro gave the sound effects and music field of this movie to a 5 years old child!!
-Politics: slightly pro-communist just like in Pan's Labyrinth, you have the bad but also the good guy being communist, perhaps Del Toro forgot that USSR and other communist dictatorships killed millions of innocent civilians? No need to make then ''the good guys'' everytime.
-The end: pathetic! totally null.
Conclusion: if you loved Pan's Labyrinth and El Orfanato, please don't watch this movie, you will hate Del Toro."
109,The Shape of Water,2,14 January 2018,Black Lagoon Redux,"Does anybody remember ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon""?Maybe this one should have been it's sequel and subtitled ""Gill Man Gets a Boner""A waste of time. YUUCK!"
110,The Shape of Water,3,14 January 2018,"Wanted to like it, but just can't","The Shape of Water (like Beauty and the Beast) is proof that the world thinks that women are so starved for love and affection that they will fall in love with ANYTHING.

(Yeah, she's got a tail but she looks like a super model and has legs when she's out of the water, so I'd do her!) Putting aside the bestiality, the fact that you can make a 7' pool in a bathroom just by closing the door, the fact that a creature from the Amazon RIVER would need salt water, the completely out of nowhere dance number, the unnecessary female nudity, the cat owner who doesn't blink an eye when his cat gets eaten, or the fact that they have to wait for it to rain to release him into the canals as opposed to just driving him directly to the ocean, The Shape of Water is an EPIC FAIL for one major reason. You have a Mexican director casting a Brit to play the one major Latina starring role in 2017. No wonder less than 5% of roles are played by Latinos when we don't hire our own."
111,The Shape of Water,3,13 January 2018,Rating,Reminded me of the same format as the movie Brazil .Also reminded of the occasional dream and wake up wondering what was that all about. Michael Shannon was head of security with a cattle probe giving it up erm now and then. Sally Hawkins would make an ideal wife as she was mute. Some times i watch a film twice because i enjoyed it so much but The shape of water doesn't come under that category.Shame

NOTES
This bizarre love story marketed as a Cold War thriller executes well, but doesn't quite come together in the end, achieving a B-. I hate it when they market movies incorrectly just to get people into the theaters. It's not what you're expecting folks. Usually writer/director Guillermo del Toro is a sure thing for me, but ""The Shape of Water"" misses the mark for reasons difficult to put my finger on.
REVIEW
Sally Hawkins's Elisa Esposito in ""The Shape of Water"" is not deaf, but is unable to speak for unknown reasons and is referred to as a ""mute"" who lives an orderly, simple little life. She lives above a rickety old movie theater that never has an audience and next to Giles (a superb Richard Jenkins (come to think of it, when is he ever not superb?)). Giles is a gay man in 1962 who is self-conscious about his age and his loss of hair. Both of them are understandably lonely and outcasts. Giles is in love with the local (much younger) pie restaurateur and Elisa pleasures herself every morning in the tub like clockwork. Elisa works at a government lab cleaning the floors alongside Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer), who carries on one-sided conversations until it's time to clock out. One day a mysterious canister arrives trailed by the ultra-macho Richard Strickland (a sadistically sensational Michael Shannon), a government agent who dragged the thing all the way up from South America where the Amazon people worshipped it like a god. Once we see the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones) chained up, helpless as Strickland tortures him with an electric cattle prod, he doesn't seem so godlike. What starts with a sympathy Elisa has for the creature becomes an affection, as she brings him boiled eggs, teaches him sign language, and plays him records during her lunch break. This otherworldly romantic sequence is at the heart of the story, but del Toro doesn't give it time to develop leaving it weirdly misplaced among the secretive Russian spies and off-the-wall racist comments provided as atmosphere. Strickland and his boss, a five-star general, decide to kill the creature so the knowledge of whatever it is and whatever humans can learn from it won't get into the hands of the Russians. Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg) pleads that it must be preserved for science. Elisa finds out and must save the Amphibian Man no matter the cost. 
If you look at all the pieces separately they're executed flawlessly. The color palate is made up of varying shades of teal (not green, teal), and is explained to be the color of the future. Strickland's car is teal, the Amphibian Man is green, the water is green, Elisa's apartment is green, the tile is green, the....you get the picture. And it's beautiful. It sets up a beautiful dreamlike tone for the story. Director of photography Dan Laustsen does excellent work making nearly every waking frame drip with water or moisture of some kind. The basement of the laboratory where Elisa and Zelda work appears to be growing moss right before your eyes. The smell of mildew translates from the screen to your unappreciative nose. All this is perfectly executed. Even the choreography of little dance numbers scattered here and there are cute and fun. Alexandre Desplat's score lifts you up and takes you on a journey to a Parisian dream where you're floating in a romantic mist. All this contributes to a dream-like beautifully greenish romantic tone.
Tone is del Toro's main problem here. There are pieces that are masterfully presented, but when they all come together they're shattered by del Toro's abrasive use of graphic images, his sexual solemnity, and his callous use of racist atmosphere. Somehow it doesn't fit together, and it's too bad, because it could've been extraordinary. This all comes to a strange end, which I found to be unsettling, but not because del Toro wanted me to feel unsettled. Maybe because the second half of the film does not fit with the first as if it's two different visions being spliced together, and the ending is the final attempt to force them together.
Hawkins as Elisa is a irresistibly charming and one can't help comparing her to Audrey Tautou in ""Amelie"" (one of my favorites). Her shyness and silence draws you in and makes you want her to be happy. Del Toro makes a point to comment on a couple of social issues rather overtly. He teaches us that the ""outcast"" or the ""other"" should not be looked down upon and deprived of human decency. He makes this clear with the use of a janitor with the inability to speak, a black female janitor, a gay man past his prime (in the 1960s), and an Amphibian Man who are all treated abhorrently by Strickland and his superiors, who represent the privileged white American male. Strickland even makes it a point to bring up that man is created in God's image, and that God looks like him, not so much Zelda, and definitely not the Amphibian Man, but him and his kind alone. Strickland represents the conservative, traditional American man with his immaculately white sunny house, his perfectly put together housewife, and his 1.5 children, which is the past, literally smelling of decay. While Elisa and the Amphibian Man represent the liberal future. A future where love knows no bounds, whether gay, straight, black, white, mute, fish, doesn't matter. 
I appreciated del Toro's messages here, and I really wanted to love this movie. I am a supporter of his and have thoroughly enjoyed his past endeavors such as ""Pacific Rim,"" ""Hellboy,"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but this most recent work fell a bit flat. The feeling I got is that this was a personal project, that del Toro cared about this story on a deeply intimate level, but it emulates the title - coming across formless and disappointingly elusive in the end."
113,The Shape of Water,4,11 January 2018,Overrated and tedious.,"Let me just say, if you're looking for something new and exciting, you won't find it here. Damn, I figure'd the whole plot even before the starting credits, it's so very predictable. And is that what people want these days? Zero imagination? just a rehash of the old and well-known? (Memberberries, anyone?)
Even later in the story I was able to predict everything! And to me, the movie lost all of it's power. It's just boring, I was waiting for it to end, so I can write this review.
I just thought that Del Toro would deliver something more imaginative, after the mediocre ""Pacific Rim"".4/10p.s. ok, I was suprised to see boobies in it :)"
114,The Shape of Water,8,11 January 2018,Artful and creative love story,"Guillermo del Toro created a visually artistic masterpiece with his visionary writing and directing. It's a unique love story told in an amazing setting. Sure there are many plot issues but the message still came across well. This type of film is not my cup of tea, but nevertheless, it deserves praise for its outstanding production. A well deserved 8/10 from me"
115,The Shape of Water,9,10 January 2018,Del Toro's Magic,"Guillermo Del Toro continues the magic he started with Pan's Labyrinth, my favorite movie of 2006, and Roger Ebert's. Sally Hawkins stars as a mute woman living in isolation who works at a top secret government facility who have captured a reptile like being who looks like the creature from the black lagoon. Del Toro was obviously influenced by 1960's American movies and television. Michael Shannon plays the requisite sadistic bad guy in charge of keeping the half man, half beast tamed, often with a cattle prod. Hawkin's, of course, falls in love with the lizard man and must help to save him from the evildoers. The Shape of Water is not a children's fairy tale, as Hawkins is often quite naked in the film. Along with Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri and Get Out, I would be satisfied with any number of Oscar's for all three."
116,The Shape of Water,8,10 January 2018,Beauty and the Water Beast,"I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. I find that is difficult to sit through Oscar bait after a long day at work but I sat in my chair without interruption. The soundtrack was phenomenal. It was the first attribute of the film that I noticed. It felt like stepping through a wormhole and going to the 1960's. Every detail was so well done. From a man battling with his own sexuality in a society where this has caused him to lose his job and his friends, to the racist remarks from the pie serving prick, del Torro depicts the era with flawless determination.I also feel like the relationship between the asset and Elisa develops swiftly and could have developed as the movie progressed. The sexuality between them should have been implied. The relationship became weird for some once the vulgarity of mating with a completely different species sets in. Overall it was an interesting and original piece that deserves its praises and nominations."
117,The Shape of Water,,10 January 2018,Ultra Liberal Propaganda,"So a black, a gay, the Russians, and a liberal woman who engages in bestiality when she's not masturbating in the tub, all unite against the white Christians who serve the one true God. The wicked do this because they blame God for everything not perfect in their life, and subsequently they hate the people who love God. It's nearing that special time, and all Christians know it and are prepared for it.May the one true God be merciful."
118,The Shape of Water,8,10 January 2018,"If they stop to think about it, perspective viewers . . .",". . . will hope that THE SHAPE OF WATER makes more sense than its title. After all, does water or any other liquid even have a shape? Certainly, frozen water cubes are generally square, but they're called ""ice,"" NOT water. Conversely, water that boils off from your pot on the stove is even more shapeless and harder to contain than liquid water, but it's called ""steam."" Movie goers have known since the 1900s era of flicks such as THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and E.T. that the first thing the U.S. military is trained to do with any inexplicable phenomena, whether it's aliens, leftover dinosaurs on Skull Island, previously unknown gods, or Jesus Himself is to blast them to smithereens in sneak ""preemptive"" strikes. Writer\director Guillermo Del Toro should not quit his day job on the Jimmy Kimmel show with the idea that THE SHAPE OF WATER proves him to be an Original Thinker. If I'm not mistaken, most Americans are giving THE SHAPE OF WATER about the same film rating received by the original version of this story, THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON."
119,The Shape of Water,7,9 January 2018,Weird but not altogether bad.,"This movie features the weirdest love story this side of Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom, but oddly enough I rather enjoyed it. It was very similar in structure to director Guillermo del Toro's most acclaimed movie, Pan's Labyrinth, to the point that a few of the minor characters and moments seemed like carbon copies. In this case, I thought Toro did a better job using the setting of the 1950's to inform the world of the movie and introduce more plot complications. However, I thought it did a pretty good job with setting up and paying off several elements throughout. The payoffs weren't the most satisfying, but they succeeded in keeping my attention.
The relationship between Elisa and the amphibious monster that she falls in love with is definitely uncomfortable and unsettling at some points, but I bought it. Their relationship reminded me of Her in that the two parties have a deep emotional connection and don't mind the fact that they are completely different things despite some of the complications that arise from it. 
Tied in closely with their relationship is the fact that Elisa is mute. The movie puts her disability at the forefront in a plot sense, and it makes up a major part of Elisa's character but not all of it. Her relatively loneliness is no doubt caused by how few people are willing to take the time to interact with and get to know her. I liked seeing a mute character be the protagonist because I'd never seen that before, except with a minor character in Alejandro Inarritu's Babel. Plus, sign language and muteness are both things that can be incorporated into movies in really cool ways, and that is definitely true here.
The villain of the movie, Strickland, is ultra-masculine and validates himself by feeling powerful at every moment. The audience spends a lot more time alone with the villain than in most movies, which I thought made Strickland a better character. However, he falls off a bit in the third act of the movie where he started getting too over-the-top and spouting monologues. 
Although I was somewhat entertained, interested, and impressed by the movie, I do not agree with its two Golden Globe wins. Guillermo del Toro did a fine job directing, but I didn't think it was anything that deserved such recognition. I don't remember Alexander Desplat's score, but that in itself makes me disagree somewhat with the fact that he won the Globe for best score. This will probably get a few Oscar nominations once they come out, maybe even a win or two, but I don't consider it ""best of the year"" in any regard.
There is also a fairly talented cast featured here. I've seen Michael Shannon's name come up in a positive context several times in the past year, and while I wasn't amazed by his performance here, I thought he was well cast and would like to see him in other things. Octavia Spencer is a welcome and entertaining presence, as always, but this wasn't one of her better performances. Sally Hawkins doesn't have a ton of opportunity to showcase talent here, but I did think she made for a good emotional protagonist.
By now, it may be difficult to see this in theaters. If you are planning on seeing it, be warned that the subject matter is more than a little creepy and unsettling. It's not a jump-scare movie, though it was advertised that way a little, nor is it visually gross, but it will throw most audience members for a bit of a loop. Overall Rating: 7.3/10."
120,The Shape of Water,10,9 January 2018,A Stunning Masterpiece!,"I usually find Guillermo del Toro's film either a hit or miss but this one is definitely a hit. The Shape of Water is a fantastical love story filled with charm, wit, danger, and somberness. While I will agree the story is a bit predictable, the characters are no less impressive and the story telling is on point with what it's trying to convey to its audience. Sally Hawkins is phenomenal with her portrayal as, Elisa, a mute woman whom cleans for a governmental facility and stumbles up on a creature they call the ""the Asset"", portrayed by the brilliant Doug Jones. Together their performance as two characters whom do not speak with their voice but with sign language or just by actions is truly breathtaking. While the overall plot may be a little unoriginal, I do believe its derivative is done with a creative twist and a spark of genius on del Toro's part. To have a strong female lead be a mute woman with timid tendencies and a quirky yet charming personality was a stroke of pure genius and you really empathize with her character. However, there is one more actor I would love to applaud for his work and that is Michael Shannon. His work never ceases to amaze me and he always portrays his villainous characters so well. His character in the movie, Richard Strickland, is the very definition of a bigoted and ignorant man I would hate to know. There times in this film where you are just feel completely disturbed by his presence and this is only watching him on the big screen! I cannot imagine what it felt like to be face to face with him while he played this vile character. I was really disappointed Michael Shannon did not even get a shred of a golden globe nomination for his performance because he truly deserved one. I love characters that I can relate to but if an actor can do their job well and really make me hate their character then I know they deserve respect. If you are looking for originality in regards to plot, I can't say this film is for you. If you enjoy originality in regards to characters, atmosphere, and special effects then this film will be for you. Its a wonderful and unique romance for those who want something different or whimsical. Overall, I do believe it deserves its praise in some areas of originality and wonderful storytelling done in such a charming way. In my opinion, its one of Guillermo del Toro's finest films he's ever made."
121,The Shape of Water,7,9 January 2018,"Del Toro's beautiful, solitary path perfected.","Lovingly informed throughout by the '30s, the '50s, cinema (and '50s cinema), J.P. Jeunet, Cocteau and Spielberg, ""The Shape of Water"" is an out of the ordinary (but not altogether exceptional) tale of romance and poetic love, told (in the best places, whispered) in the manner of the uninhibited poetic fantasy of bygone eras Del Toro seems to incurably cling to.
I love him for that."
122,The Shape of Water,9,9 January 2018,Shape of water depends on what it is used to contain it,"Del Toro's visually dazzling dark fantasy is probably his best since Pan's Labrynth. The story has got elements from a number of fairy tales and so many other fairy tales are referenced throughout. The production design and the sound design along with the music is as great as the cast. Hawkins, Shannon, Stuhlbarg, Jenkins and even Jones in all the makeup have done a fantastic job. There must be a lot of symbolism I've missed because there were certain moments and images that seemed important and I could understand half of it too but couldn't decipher it completely."
123,The Shape of Water,,9 January 2018,A captivating tale,"This film tells the story of a mute woman who bonds with a mysterious amphibious creature in a top secret research facility.The story is captivating because it portrays the mute woman's inner world fully. I can feel her bonding with the creature, out of being misunderstood, and out of being lonely. They are in the same shoes, and they break every imaginable barrier to bond. It is a beautiful story, even with its occasional violence and goriness. Sally Hawkins was great in ""Maudie"", and she is equally great in ""The Shape of Water"" as well."
124,The Shape of Water,6,9 January 2018,"Started out so good, and then it lost me","I was really enjoying the weirdness, the atmosphere, the unconventional narrative until the midpoint - and then it fell apart. I for sure thought I'd be in for a treat, but boy, what a missed opportunity. And I love del Toro otherwise! Only okay in my book, sorry."
125,The Shape of Water,8,9 January 2018,"Thank you Russia, Thank you USSR for the greatest movies that get copied still and nowdays !","I'd give it 10 or 9 just for the camera. What a production: the angles the light. 
But the idea of the movie is clearly saying: "" Hello ! With love from USSR 1961"".
Yes! And people in Russia are still watching those moves. What a great idea
Russian ""AGENT"" wins golden globes in 2018
With love from USSR (1961).
So, giving it 8."
126,The Shape of Water,10,9 January 2018,Del Toro has done it again!,"I just got back from seeing 'The Shape of Water' today....
Director/Creator Del Toro has mixed a love story, fantasy, science fiction, and a 1960's era Cold War period piece/commentary film, all rolled into one.... and it all works! I fell in love with this film from the magical opening credit scenes, and enjoyed all the developing dialog, characters, moments of action, humor, nudity & sexuality, and some violence, all of which served to tell the whole story, in this beautiful and very adult fairy-tale of a film! 
The movie shows what Del Toro has been and continues to be.... a true modern-day artist & poet of a filmmaker.... Pure genius! 
-Thank-You & Muchas Gracias, Guillermo!!!"
127,The Shape of Water,10,9 January 2018,A message of love.,"What a beautiful film. In fact it is the same message of love I heard in the film ARRIVAL, women are LOVE. Violence and stupidity are the realm of men. Our world is slowly but surely engaged in a undeniable path of destruction and the only way to save us is if women take control of the powers that rule this world."
128,The Shape of Water,10,8 January 2018,A Beautiful and Enthralling Achievement,"The Shape of Water is a gorgeous achievement in film, one of the best of 2017, and one of Guillermo del Toro's finest.We'll start with a paragraph that can apply to any of del Toro's films. It's damn beautiful. Every scene, every setpiece, every emotional beat, is dripping with so much character and vibrancy that it's impossible not to be enthralled from beginning to end. Every frame is a masterpiece, and beyond that, del Toro perfectly films each shot in interesting ways that always remain appropriate for the film's tone. It feels like a finely crafted adult fairy tale. It's like a less-steampunk version of Bioshock.The casting is also brilliant for the roles. Sally Hawkins is the standout, as our protagonist, Elisa. I could not imagine anyone else doing better in this role. There wasn't a single scene, a single moment, where she wasn't perfect for what the film needs. I bought in completely.The other cast members are equally well-suited for their roles. Octavia Spencer is excellent as the foul-mouthed, funny, and caring friend and coworker. Michael Shannon's villain, while a bit over the top, certainly gets the job done and drives many scenes of the film. Richard Jenkins is a delight, as he often is. And, of course, I've got to give some credit to Doug Jones as the monster. Everything else being great, the movie still doesn't work if the monster is unconvincing or silly, and he nails it.Another standout, for me, is the score. The music is not only outstanding on its own, but actively enhances just about every scene. It never comes on too strong, it doesn't steal the show, it just gracefully supplements the on-screen action flawlessly. It's in-line with the setting, the themes, the tone, sentimental when it needs to be, and grandiose, orchestral, and sweeping during the more bombast moments. There were many moments while watching where I couldn't help but sit and smile at the gorgeousness of the film, and they were all moments where the score was in full-swing. It's perfectly appropriate for the film itself, and it's also a soundtrack that I wouldn't mind listening to on its own.While I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the film, it wasn't without flaws:The story is quite simple. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the entire story outside of the final five minutes. Every plot point is easy enough to predict, and every scene plays out as expected (I understand that this isn't necessarily an objective flaw. There's of course nothing inherently wrong with 'simple' stories. I just prefer writing that's generally more enigmatic, I guess). That being said, the scenes also play out with so much beauty, and every setpiece and shot is so meticulously crafted that I'm 100% fine with going along for the ride.Also, like most del Toro films, there's not much room for thought outside of the film. It gives you everything you need and more, delivers it on a silver platter topped with whipped cream, a million cherries, wrapping paper, and a bow for good measure. If you've seen a del Toro film, you know that he loves his metaphors and allegory. But there's a difference between simply putting this stuff in a film and letting the audience do some work to discover them (which, as a filmgoer, is often the most rewarding aspect of watching well-crafted movies), and repeatedly slapping you across the face with them. Again, is this an objective flaw? Certainly not. Just personal preference, so I'm not faulting it too much.Lastly, the characters are cartoonish to the point where it feels like the movie is forcing you to feel certain ways, instead of provoking free thought. There's honestly a decent moral and ethical argument in here about the treatment of a creature like this, about how exactly to proceed knowing it possesses a clear intelligence. Instead, we get an over the top, one-dimensional, pure evil villain (another del Toro staple) along with protagonists who are basically too perfect, without any flaws whatsoever. I'm better about overlooking this half of it, as they are at least incredibly charming, and Sally Hawkins is prefect for the role. Listen, given this set up, it's not difficult - at all - to get us on the protagonist's side. Trust that Sally Hawkins as Elisa will get us there (she would have, easily). You don't have to twist the audience's arm and make her go up against despicable, irredeemable evil in Michael Shannon (who is also great) in order to get us there. Just tone it down with the shades of black and white that are layered on these people. It feels like we're being forced to feel a way that we would have anyway. At the end of the day, is it a big flaw? Not really (I've certainly spent way too much time talking about it for how small of a flaw it is, honestly). The movie is great despite this. It's just something I noticed here, and is also prevalent in his other films, so I thought it was worthy of mentioning.I've spent too much time talking about flaws that really don't hurt the end product all that much. I think the movie is largely so beautiful and enjoyable that the few flaws stick out a bit more. The good elements of this are so great that I'd rather tell people to go see the movie to experience them, while the bad elements are so small and subjective that I feel like I'm obligated to explain them in more detail just to make it clear as to what I mean with my criticisms.Make no mistake, The Shape of Water is an excellent, excellent film. One of my favorites of the year, and probably my favorite Guillermo del Toro work. I'd recommend it to anyone."
129,The Shape of Water,9,8 January 2018,Great work of creativity,"A beautiful and sensual masterpiece of Guillermo Del Toro. Its one of the most creative stories in years, that's for sure, even if the subtle storyline refers to the famous ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme. Its a brave film that works even due to fantastical elements mostly because of the great amount of emotions from what the film lives. Not only the story is creative, so are the characters, especially in the way the are connected. Another great choice was to have all lead characters with a burden. You have a mute lead the film, a gay loner being the second lead and a colored help being one of the greatest heroins. 
Sally Hawkins was fantastic. She really has a brilliant year with this and ""Maudie"". One more prove that she is such a versatile actress. The performance she delivered was so tender and soulful, that you must love that character. Michael Shannon was the villain, and while most of his actions were a bit stereotypical, the character was not. He got an interesting backstory and was very well developed. Shannon himself went beyond that and once again gives a very intense and memorable performance. Richard Jenkins had many great and memorable moments that really stick with you. He makes you care for his role from the first appearance on screen to his last. And you feel sorry for him all the time because of the very natural turn he did. Octavia Spencer is a true scene stealer. Her speciality to mix wit with seriousness works here just perfectly. Its a great role for Spencer and she possibly gives her best performance since ""The Help"". There is so much going on behind her eyes. You really miss her when she is not on screen. The score is beautiful the look is tremendous and Del Toro told the story like a novel. Sometimes he let it go a bit, especially towards the end but generally it is a very intense and focused direction. 
Surely a film that sticks with you and I am glad that Hollywood did not lose all its creativity."
130,The Shape of Water,8,8 January 2018,Strange concept............... Brilliant execution!!!!!!!,"Now when I first heard of this film and subsequently watching the trailer, I was left wondering how on earth this film could actually work with such an outlandish story. Oh wow has Mr. Del Toro pulled this one off in some style it must be said, this film is full of surprises.Firstly, even the idea of having a main character that is mute and doesn't speak a word is extremely ballsy because it is essential it works otherwise the film would not stand up and audience will not connect to it. Wow just wow is the performance from Sally Hawkins just fantastic and even though she conveys most of her emotions and thoughts through sign language, its the looks and mannerisms of the character that are brilliantly done. You as the audience can tell straight away the feelings of her character with the smallest emotion on her face or body language, top class acting and she 100% deserves awards for this. All the other performances are all again really strong, the other highlights I would say are Richards Jenkins and Michael Shannon. Both bring there A game to the table on this film, Jenkins is a lonely heart warming character out of time. Whilst Shannon is just born to play a bad guy and he is so menacing even though in reality he is an every day guy with a family just doing his weird........very weird job. The directing from Guillermo del Toro is sublime you can tell the time and effort that have been put into creating this film, ever shot is done perfectly. The camera at times moves elegantly through the air, as if you were swimming, it works so perfectly for the era of the film and the central story. Coupled together with the amazing cinematography the film looks spectacular from start to finish. This is a true technical achievement behind the camera.The last positives are the creature effects and score, both of which are brilliant. Firstly the effects of the creature are brilliant making the creature look so grounded in reality in and strange way as if he could really exist today. Also the score that seamlessly blends in and out of the film complimenting the direction and pace of the film, very good.Overall its 85 out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10, this film is very good from a technical stand point and with one brilliant performance from Sally Hawkins. The only part I didn't like was this strange singing and dancing scene that made know sense, didn't fit in the film at all. Apart from that this film is great with a central love story that is one of the best that I've scene in a long time from two characters that never speak a word!!!!! Definitely worth peoples time and attention, deserves many awards!!!!"
131,The Shape of Water,6,8 January 2018,Haven't we seen this before?,"A role-reversed R-rated horror version of Splash. The creature is pretty much a combination of the one from Hellboy and The Creature From The Black Lagoon. Not bad, but disappointing."
132,The Shape of Water,8,8 January 2018,Expectional love story,"I saw this at Night Visions event in November. This is really exceptional film. 
One of the best movies of 2017 easily. Everything about this is top notch the acting, set design and the plot. This tooks place in year 1962 and Sally Hawkins plays main character who is mute Elisa who works at the hidden high-security government laboratory as janitor with her co-worker Zelda played by Octavia Spencer. Elisa's life changes when she discovers a secret classified experiment and its not somethign ordinary. Doug Jones is excellent as the water creature. Supporting cast is also very good. Michael Shannon plays once again very good villain role. There is great humour once awhile. Highlight of this movie is Sally Hawkins she is amazing. 
Overall this I love this movie. I highly recommend this to all Del Toro fans you wont be disappointed."
133,The Shape of Water,9,8 January 2018,Del Toro's fantastic spin on a timeless story,"The story is not extremely original, basically it's Amelie meets Abe Sapien, but Del Toro's storytelling and directing makes this film into an unforgettable fairytale. Different from his other films, his take on this story is generally very timid and romantic. Some scenes are so harsh and extreme, they remind us that this is Guillermo Del Toro afterall and he didn't loose his creepy touch. All in all a great film."
134,The Shape of Water,10,8 January 2018,Classic movie with a modern twist and story of love,"Man 2017 it chalk full of great movies. This one too, did not disappoint. I love the touches of classic movies pre 50's era. The acting by all is remarkable. At first it was strange watching a women fall for an animal, but overtime I started to open my mind. I definitely recommend seeing this movie. Glad it won golden globes."
135,The Shape of Water,10,8 January 2018,A nice short review with no spoilers,"The Shape Of Water in a sentence. It's a VERY adult fantasy love story. Words I would use to describe the experience. Delightful, whimsical, sexual, magical, romantic, musical, grotesquely violent, and finally, unique. I want to stress the sexual and grotesquely violent aspects for anyone deciding to bring their children to see it - you'll have some explaining to do after. But for adults, this movie is pure magic. Don't miss it in the theater!I loved it to death and will see it again before it leaves my local theater! Worth the ticket price, no regrets. I cried tears of joy during a particular black and white musical segment that was so surreal and you just know you're watching someting special when it happens. If you saw this movie, you know what part I'm talking about.More movies like this please!"
136,The Shape of Water,10,8 January 2018,Mute woman saves natural creature from vicious governments,"So what is the shape of water anyway? 
 Water is a malleable element that assumes the shape of its container. It's a life-force, an inner quality that can't be read from its surface. It has no exclusive shape but is a sustaining presence.
 The same can be said for humanity. Humanity is an essential quality that can be found in any number of forms. Here it propels the mute Eliza, the struggling gay artist Giles and reluctant help Delilah, and it is embodied in the mysterious amphibian monster. That natural humanity has been trapped by the US army which intends either his live dissection or his murder to serve the government's fears. 
 That merman seems godlike in his healing powers. That's because he is a creature of nature, not the species man so long removed from it. He restores Giles' hair, disappears his wound, cures his own bullet-holes - and ultimately brings eternal life via love to Eliza. 
 As an orphan Eliza Esposito is cut off from any earthly roots, but she has an instinctual connection to the source of life, water. Hence her immediate attraction to and sympathy for the merman. She persuades Giles to help save him because of their common humanity, theirs and the merman's. 
 Her job reduces her to cleaning the masters' piss, blood and excrement. But her humanity has profounder roots than anyone else here. In the opening scene she is asleep and freed into her natural state - floating in an ocean that fills her room, all the furniture bobbing about, until she eases back down to her sofa and awakens into her lesser world, mundane reality. While her egg-timer ticks off her breakfast, she masturbates in her tub, exulting in her freedom, fullness and immersion. 
 The film does have a fish out of water, but it's not the merman. It's the pie-clerk, a bigot from Ottawa who fakes the chain's ""Southern Hospitality.""
 The film also has an obscene monster but it's not the merman. It's the director Strickland. As he grinds his candies and scarfs painkillers he pretends to civilized order, discipline, citizenship, potency, but he's the film's biggest loser. He tortures the merman monstrously, sexually threatens Eliza, demeans her and her partner Zelda, and so provokes the audience's proper rejection that we cheer when his new Cadillac gets crunched. 
 Like water and humanity, manhood cannot be characterized by its outer appearance or shape. Zelda has bigger balls than her cowardly husband Brewster. Despite his failure as an illustrator, the gay and lonely Giles proves manlier than Strickland when he helps free the merman, from driving the rescue laundry van to knocking down Strickland to enable the escape. 
 So, too, the merman's flat groin unfurls a sexual potency that fulfills Eliza and brings them eternal love. This while Strickland loses his fingers, which even after reattachment turn black and putrid. He may have saved his ""pussy finger"" but he's ultimately emasculated.
 Guillermo del Toro pointedly sets the film in1950s America. That's the America that the current Republican government aims to restore. Hence the pie-clerk's and Strickland's racism, the clerk's homophobia, Strickland's sexism, classism and complacent materialism. Strickland is sure ""The Lord's image"" is his, not black Zelda's and certainly not the merman's. Indeed, he loses the trail when he snaps ""What am I doing, interviewing the shit cleaners?""
 As the five-star General Hoyt admonishes him, ""Decency is what we export. We don't use it ourselves."" Their attack on the merman evokes Trump's evisceration of the EPA, his revival of the murderous coal industry and lately to pillage the national parks and to mine the entire seacoast with oil drilling. To Strickland the mysterious captive natural power is only ""the asset"" - as negative a positive as one could assign a living creature. 
 Though the Russians are as murderous as the American's, the Russian scientist spy Hofstetler articulates the human value: ""I don't want an intricate, beautiful thing destroyed!"" We don't have to be restricted to our government's inhumanity. 
 Though the film is framed with shots of Eliza floating in a watery world, first during her dream, then liberated with her merman, the film has another frame, Giles's narration. He tells the story. As he admits its mystery and his incomprehension it represents his blossoming into a fuller self as well as Eliza's. 
 Initially he's an ex-alcoholic failure struggling to get work drawing ad designs. That's a very '50s profession, sustaining a false dream-life for American consumerism as false as the fantasies screened in the Orpheum under Giles' and Eliza's flats. Encountering the merman liberates him too. Giles starts drawing emotional representations of the strange creature and his connection to our humanity. Giles switches his hand and his imagination from selling a false image of happiness to probing our wilder possibilities."
137,The Shape of Water,4,8 January 2018,A fantasy of bestiality,"It's well filmed and acted but basically this is a love affair between a woman and an animal. If the animal were a horse and we saw scenes of the two having sexual intercourse nobody would stomach it. Make the animal a fish on two legs though, an imaginary creature, and audiences will accept it. But there's no difference, it's still bestiality.The plot of the film is as silly as the premise, two cleaning ladies defeating the whole security of a government facility. To be honest I was rooting for the government, Fishface needed to be studied in the interests of science.Not one of del Toro's better films, he seems to have lost his touch lately."
138,The Shape of Water,10,6 January 2018,A Beautiful Love Story With Emotion Dripping Everywhere,Http://nickkaminskysblogspot.blogspot.com/2017/12/review-shape-of-water.html
139,The Shape of Water,10,6 January 2018,loved this kind movie.,"Sally hawkins is transcendent, luminous. 
the set design is creative - consistently dark and retro in a kind of cozy batman way. 
up to now, i have only seen hawkins play awkward, geeky roles - a revelation to see her charismatic, graceful, and sexy. impressively erotic merman as well.
in a way, it's a comic-book superhero movie, but the best one ever.
i was worried this film would be a downer like ""pan's labyrinth."" it's not. whew!"
140,The Shape of Water,10,6 January 2018,above all it is a film about feelings,"By subverting and paying homage to all sorts of styles and genres, Del Toro creates his own style and his own genre in The Shape of Water, a film that will hopefully live on for generations and be considered a masterful classic by future filmgoers. Many people will hate it (there are already plenty of reviews on this very site that are unreasonably negative, which is always bound to happen when someone creates a work of art that is genuinely beautiful and creative and is also willing to take people out of their comfort zones and be totally weird and have serious moral questions and thought provoking statements to make), but many people will, and should, love it until the end of time. It is a moving, touching, thrilling, frightening, funny, and romantic hybrid of the whimsical fairy tale, the classic Universal monster flick, the Old Hollywood melodrama, the surrealist film, the fantastically foreign art house masterpiece, and probably tons of other things to. The characters are well developed, Del Toro's lens has a profound understanding of human emotion that makes me want to cry as I reflect upon this simply flat out majorly f*cking brilliant movie...that's enough of my talking, just see it!"
141,The Shape of Water,9,6 January 2018,So original,Sublime and wonderful performances from all major characters. I don't think I've seen a more intricately detailed movie - both in set design and character development. Touching depictions of 1960's bigotry that are subtle and realistic. So original. A must see!
142,The Shape of Water,10,6 January 2018,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful","Nothing can be said about this film without prefacing it by one thing: this film is STUNNINGLY gorgeous. Since every single shot is a moving shot, and the color temperature is often cool or green toned, the cinematography gives the feeling of calmly and peacefully floating underwater. This is a strange- but perfect- love story that had me leaving the theater feeling as though I was the one who'd found a perfect romance, not the characters on screen. Offset by gore and sometimes gory comedy, this film is a perfect mix of lovey-dovey romance, drama, realism, and even horror. The social commentary deals with issues of feminism, racism, and even homophobia in a period where all of these were hot button issues, but in which period films of the era rarely venture. Overall a stunning, beautiful, heartfelt film that is an absolute must-see."
143,The Shape of Water,9,5 January 2018,Del Toro's most artful and meaningful film since Pan's Labryinth,"So my award contenders binge begins with the Shape of Water. This was a very beautiful movie. Very "" steamy""and ""violent"" . But I really enjoyed it. I saw the Guillermo del Toro exhibit at LACMA last year and the man has such a unique style that I really admire. He knows how to world build in a way that's both magical and realistic. I mean this production design is just outstanding and beautiful to look at. Its a romantic story with beautiful art direction and awesome performances. The score was actually really nice too it was refreshing to have nice music in the background that flowed really well. I really liked Richard Jenkins and how even though it's in the 60's his story is very relevant to today. Sally Hawkins plays a mute character this entire movie and even though she doesn't say a word her performance sill conveys so much emotion. The movie can be off putting for some people because it might be cheesy or just really creepy and odd but it's crafted so well the pros outweigh the cons for me. I think I have to remove the It movie from my top 10 and bump some things up one so this becomes #6 on my list. I'll post a final list once I see the other nominees if I make more changes. Ps to all my fellow gamers, if Bioshock were to become a movie should Del Toro do it? I mean watch the first 10 minutes and think what it would be like if he did a Bioshock movie. Easy 9.5/10 for me."
144,The Shape of Water,10,4 January 2018,Best film story of 2017,"Beautiful, fairy-tale pure story was not only a metaphor for the too common inhumanity of man toward anything not exactly like man, but was also a love story showing how love can happen anytime to anyone, and with no boundaries, even death. Filmmaker Del Toro showed the soul and sensibility of the ages here in his depiction of a shy, working class girl who fell in love with a sea creature in a government ""research project"" reminiscent of the 50's Communist era witch hunts. And, with the same dark intentions.The film's somber mood, dim and sad colorization of the ""research"" area, and the interplay of the characters was so effective in the fairy tale atmosphere it gave to a very serious world problem............man's tendency of hate and cruelty toward anything not exactly like he is, in body and in mind. That that way of thinking is so wrong is well shown here in a harsh way, but also in a way that resonates with anyone who resists that cast in stone way of thinking and acting toward different others.The acting was uniformly great, as was the soundtrack, sets and costuming. And, of course, ""the creature"" was marvelous, so nuanced and subtle. Loved the unique noises he made, and their individual shading depending on what was happening,.... it was all too....can I say..... ""human"", and one of the best and most informative parts of the story. Enjoy this wonderful film, as you will not see another like it until another Del Toro film comes our way."
145,The Shape of Water,7,4 January 2018,I fell in love with an amorphous amphibian creature,"This was the first film by del Toro that I have seen, and I believe that he has made a very good impression on me. He has crafted here a tale of magical realism, with a wondrous amphibian-like creature (Doug Jones) who falls in love with a mute human girl, Elisa (Sally Hawkins). In many ways, it really feels kind of like a fairy tale, with a narrator (who is introduced at the beginning and disappears and comes back at the end - it felt kind of slapped on however), a mystical and godly creature and its lover, and the evil antagonist, Dick Strickland (Michael Shannon), rife with selfishness and hatred. Each of the characters are intricately written and detailed, and are each characterized in a unique and interesting way, very unlike most anything I have ever seen, but done so well and obviously it makes me wonder why it hasn't been done that way before. And to fill these characters are actors that give some of the best performances of the year, especially Hawkins and Shannon. Hawkins doesn't speak a single word throughout this film and conveys every bit of dialogue she needs through her face alone, aided by her signing which was so fluid it seemed like she learned American Sign Language in its entirety in order to play this part. Shannon does so well playing the villain that I would have been satisfied if it ended with him winning. These are some characters that you can really get behind and root for, no matter what side they're on. The creature was beautiful. I couldn't tell if it was done practically or with CGI and I think that attests to how well it was produced. And to sum it up, the dialogue and story were held with care and each felt finely crafted. Oh, and I want to praise the film for being ballsy as well, there was a full nudity masturbation scene in the first five minutes that totally caught me by surprise.
But, I don't feel that everything about this story was so finely told - mainly the attempt to humanize the creature. He eats eggs like us, he listens to music like us, and he has sex like us? What? They don't exactly bridge this conclusion all that well and it's never really explained why Elisa is attracted to the creature in the first place, aside from the fact she might relate to it emotionally. This kind of makes the love aspect of the story feel a little shotty. I could understand wanting to protect and care for this beast, but Frenching it? Idk del Toro. It felt like some sort of furry/bestiality porn to me, and everything up to this point was some really elaborate foreplay. Maybe it wasn't that intense, but I still got that feeling at points. Also, the pacing felt kind of weird between the climax halfway through the film and the climax at the end. Everything slows down super quickly and it feels like it's The Shape of Molasses. But the ending I will admit does kind of make up for that. It's safe to say that this is one of the best of the year and I am sure that it'll be nominated for some Oscars in at least some regard."
146,The Shape of Water,,3 January 2018,LOve happens,"I literally fell into the shape of water. I walked into the theatre not knowing what to expect. I thought it was going to be another scary movie. But instead I was pleasantly surprised because it was a story about Love. How two misfits come together to celebrate a connection. The invaluable importance of loyalty and friendship. How often we tend to disregard the misunderstood and the individuals or things that live on the fringe of a predictable world. This movie touched my heart and gives me hope about finding acceptance in the world that wants to categorize people, things, and events into a neat and organized order."
147,The Shape of Water,10,3 January 2018,Not What I Expected,"I went expecting to see a tacky sci-fi. This film is neither. It is absolutely epic. The acting is so good it makes an unbelievable situation believable and emotionally captivating. I came to absolutely love the heroes and hate the villains. The ending is a surprise so I will not spoil it but it is beautiful. The trailers for this film do not
and could not do it justice. This is not a film you can adequately show off or sample in sound bites. It is a film you must watch from start to end and it just keeps getting deeper and better right up to the time when the credits roll. Not a frame of this film is wasted, every millisecond is an important and integral part pf the story. Sally Hawkins is stunning in this role and it is a role that only a very excellent actress could have made believable and she did so superbly. Everything really had to come together from the story to the scripting to the casting, acting, and directing for this to work a it does. This film will remain a favorite of mine for a very long time."
148,The Shape of Water,10,3 January 2018,Love Runs Deep,"One of the best things for me about the fantasy genere is the romance aspect. Most of the best love stories come from this genere, I feel though it we have not just more creative freedom but the freedom to express what we geniuely feel. It's also expresses our deep seeded believe that someone somewhere is one for us and the struggle we go though to find and stay with them.Del Toro is one of my favorate movie directors and believe or not this is my favorate movie from him and one of my favorate films in general. This is another kind of film I can't help but feel was almost made for me as it has three of the things I love in most movies; monsters, fantasy, and romance. The premise isn't exactly anything new but it's really more in it's execution that makes it stand out.There are just so many great things from the cinematography and production value which is great. I really like how it recreated early 1960s era which was a time of chaos from bigotry and intolerance on all sides but also great change as minorities were struggling for equal rights. Music is just fantastic, the orchastratic score is just beautiful as it just perfectly captures what's happening but most importantly the feelings of both Eliza and the Creature and who they are as characters. However the best thing for me is the song ""You Never Know"" which is just wonderful and perfectly reflects the relationship.Characters are great from the supporting charcters; Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer are great as Eliza's friends, there is great back and forth between them but I like how well rounded both characters are as we get some depth on them to show the commonality all three have as each of them are struggling and dealing with intolerance on all fronts and forms.Michael Shannon is good as a villain you plain hate as he is a monster in the guise of authority. Theres an interesting character study about him is we get depth into his diseased psyche as he is literally a product of his time, a man living on fixed notions on what a person is supposed to be, which justifies why change or anything different that threats his infastruction shouldn't be aloud. But little does he know or a creeping awareness is he's just part of a dying breed because all those notions are bull crap, despite all the things he has in his life like the teal Cadalac, the whole American dream package he's never content because it's all materialistic there is nothing spiritually going on in his life which makes him spiritually empty.But of coruse what really makes this film are both Eliza and the Creature. Elsa and the Anphibian Creature are another one of my favorate fictional couples in my book up there with Misa and Hikaru in ""Macross"" and many others on my list, because like any romance story done right I actually care about both characters. The chemistry between both of them is just beautiful, I really was invested into their connection, despite their differences their feelings for each other are human.Sally Hawins is just great as Eliza, it's probably my favorate role from her. I'll level with you I actually have a crush on this actress believe or not. Sure she doesn't look like someone from the damn CW which makes it all the better. Personally I think she's beautiful inside and out, I really love here character and she's relatable as I'm not a person that talks much either. Despite a lonely soul, her mute condition and not living in the greatest circumstances she never lets it get her down, she's socialable, she has dreams, even like that she knows how to have fun as we see her display some dancing talent.The Anphibian Creature is great played of coruse by make up and costume actor Doug Jones. The design is great it's all practically there's no CGI bull crap, it really looks like something that could really exist. The creature is a fascinating character despite a mute and not much depth but I find sometimes what you don't say you say a lot. I love that there is mystery to him as you wonder if it's one of the meza god's from Mayan Legend, the God Nepturn from Greek Mythology, a creature seen or even worshiped from the lost civilizations like Atlantis or may'be even the mermaid creatures we heard of from fairy tales, as well as certain abilities of his which show as Shakespere put it ""There are more things in heaven and earth."" However it's really in it's behavior that makes us really connect and sympathize because his childlike curiousity and feelings make him very human.What makes the chemistry truly unique is that it's non verbal which to me is the best approach; it avoids a fundamental problem most romance films have where sometimes both characters go into a bunch of meaningless melodramatic prattle that really dampins the story. Personally in romance stories I find the quiet physical expression the best parts because both characters are expressing what they truly feel for one another.
Despite communicated in silence you can hear them loud and clear from not just their sign language but also just physicality which made the connection all the more genuine and beautiful. As Old Pete once said, ""If love is really true, it doesn't need an answer.""There are a lot of beautiful moments between the two like two scenes seeing both Eliza and him underwater together, which was like seeing a dance from how they move and float together. And there is one dream sequence which was great as it's a throwback to some of the old Hollywood musicals, let alone suprising seeing Sally sing and dance which I knew nothing about.The film does a good job at touching upon the issue of racism as well as other themes like the power of indiviuals and miniorities over corrupt powers and the infaststures built on their lies, the meaning of true humanity. But most importantly the universality of love and how there are no barriers or differences.Elsa and the Creature's love for each other just like the depths of the ocean runs deep.Rating: 4 stars"
149,The Shape of Water,8,31 December 2017,A Creature Feature Romance,"Imagine the Universal Pictures' horror classic ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954) revamped as a romantic escapade, and you'll have some idea what to expect from ""Hellboy"" helmer Guillermo del Toro's supernatural saga ""The Shape of Water,"" starring Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, and Michael Shannon. Doug Jones plays an enigmatic humanoid amphibian from the Amazon who walks upright on two legs. Equipped with gills and face like C3p0, he lands in the hands of the U.S. Government. ""The Shape of Water"" takes place in 1961 during the early years of the Space Race between Uncle Sam and the Soviet Union. Unlike the reptilian ""Black Lagoon Creature,"" this gill guy wouldn't frighten a fly, though he does use his large, webbed hands with claws to tear a couple of fingers off his sadistic human curator. Later, he munches on the head of a contentious cat. Scrambling to launch a man into space, the U.S. Government believes this creature will provide them with answers to questions about human survival in space. Basically, this fable concerns an oversized lab specimen and the heartless abuse that his captors inflict on him with Nazi-like relish for their research. Mind you, Hollywood has made movies comparable to ""The Shape of Water,"" such as ""Splice"" (2009), about a lab specimen that unscrupulous researchers concocted from a genetic crucible and then learned they couldn't control it. The humanoid amphibian here isn't as treacherous as the feminine hybrid in ""Splice"" or the ""Species"" (1995) franchise. Indeed, ""The Shape of Water"" creature is altogether sympathetic, and del Toro's relies on imagery designed to win our sympathy-particularly when it is chained up in a way reminiscent of the ""Frankenstein"" monster. A huge metal shackle surrounds its neck while a spider-web of chain links hold it down to a huge circular pad. Nevertheless, despite a few scenes where the villain gouges it with an electric cattle prod, ""The Shape of Water"" focuses on a mute cleaning lady at the top-secret complex who falls in love with it and yearns to free it. When it doesn't remind you of ""Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" del Toro's winsome yarn evokes memories of ""Beauty and the Beast."" Mind you, occasionally things happen that may confound audiences, but ""The Shape of Water"" is ostensibly a love story that indulges in surrealism without rubbing your face in its less savory moments. No, it isn't surprising that del Toro co-wrote and directed this fanciful epic. After all, he was responsible for ""Hellboy"" (2004) and ""Hellboy: The Golden Army."" 
 
Korean War veteran Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon of ""Man of Steel"") has captured an anonymous amphibian during a South American safari, and General Hoyt (Nick Searcy of ""The Fugitive"") wants a team of scientists to slice it up to see if they can duplicate its ability to live in different environments. Strickland serves as a sadistic jailor who terrorizes the amphibian with an electric cattle prod. He enjoys wreaking pain on it, especially after it rips off two of his fingers. This amphibian is imprisoned at a top-secret government research facility where Elisa Esposito (British actress Sally Hawkins of ""Blue Jasmine"") works as a cleaning lady. Elisa's best friend, Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer of ""The Help""), does her talking for her, because Elisa is mute and can only communicate with sign language. Elisa feels sad about the way the creature is mistreated. She displays compassion for it, feeding it hard-boiled eggs and playing music for it on her portable record player. The amphibian reciprocates her kindness. Moreover, the creature seems to fathom sign language, and the two become friends. Eventually, the scientists realize the only way to exact the secrets of the gill man's mysterious corporeal being is to perform an autopsy on it. Predictably, Elisa cannot let this unspeakable act transpire so she exploits her knowledge of the security measures, and plots an escape plan. She finds an unlikely ally in the form of another scientist, Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg of ""Doctor Strange""), who argues killing the amphibian is the worst thing that they can do for their research. While he is sympathetic to the plight of the creature, Hoffstetler has his own subversive reasons for not destroying it. Meantime, Zelda has no idea that Elisa has become so inextricably enamored of the creature. Initially, Elisa doesn't want to involve Zelda in the escape. Instead, she enlists her next-door neighbor, a lonely artist, Giles (Richard Jenkins of ""Me, Myself & Irene""), to help her undertake this spine-tingling caper. Hoffstetler throws in with them and furnishes a vital distraction guaranteed to make the escape a surefire success. 
 
Guillermo del Toro orchestrates several white-knuckled sequences during the breakout that will put you on the edge of your seat. However, it isn't so much the way he stages ""The Shape of Water"" that makes it memorable, but the gallery of characters that he spends a little more than two hours creating until we either love them or hate them. Elisa lives in her own fantasy world above a movie theater, and she has a dull, drab existence until she encounters this strange amphibian and tenders her love to it. Shrewdly, del Toro and ""Divergent"" scenarist Vanessa Taylor make the characters as strong a story element as the predicament in which the amphibian finds itself. All good adventure outings require a dangerous antagonist, and Mike Shannon does a fantastic job making Richard Strickland a thoroughly obnoxious dastard. Nevertheless, they don't skimp on his character. The subplots involving Strickland's purchase of a 1962 Cadillac and his marriage are hilarious. Even peripheral characters, like General Hoyt, stand out. Unfortunately, gifted as she is, Oscar-winning Octavia Spencer appears to have been cast primarily because she played in ""The Help,"" and del Toro and Taylor exploit this advantage in amusing little ways. Unquestionably, ""The Shape of Water"" is as implausibly preposterous but entertaining as the 2006 M. Night Shyamalan fantasy ""The Lady in the Water."""
150,The Shape of Water,8,31 December 2017,A Beautiful Underwater Love Story,"The Shape of Water (2017) Guillermo del Toro is back. Whimsical love story between a mute and a god-like creature from South America. A film rich with meaning. Cold War, early 1960s. The choice for neither of the lovers to have to ability to speak was genius. They communicate in adorable sign language, gifts of eggs, a card that says ""Glad to have you as my friend"", and emotional connection. Is this not the purest form of love? Early on, Elisa signs ""You. Me. Together"", and it is devastating when she has to let him go, making him understand that it can no longer be that way, that it is now ""You. Alone. Without me.""The set, meticulously arranged. Besides the obvious theme of water, there is significant color symbolism. Teal is the color of the future. In general, other greens are as well (pies, car, lab, uniforms in lab, gelatine, the creature). Blue, cyans, greens, contribute to the feel of water and fantasy; almost a mystical world, Elisa's World. Everyone else's worlds (Giles, Zelda, Strickland) are Goldens, Ambers and warm colors (Air, Day). Red for Cinema, Life and Love. Extraordinary cinematography. Elisa and Giles live above a theater, exhibited gorgeously when she immerses herself with her lover underwater, flooding her apartment and dripping onto customers downstairs. What a beautiful underwater paradise. This is recreated in the final scene, as the two lovers escape in the canal, oh so in love, together forever. Each of the main characters are outcasts: Elisa the mute, her black spunky best friend Zelda, her older gay neighbor Giles, Doctor Hoffstetler (really a Soviet Spy named Demetri), insane villain Strickland who is so driven to perform he has little attachment to his family. It was quite the achievement in such an artsy piece to be able to make each of the characters relatable and lovable. More obviously Elisa, Giles, and the creature. But I also really felt for the undercover Soviet Spy, who actually double crosses both the Americans and Russians by playing a pivotal role in The Asset's escape and rescue. We see the lonely world he is forced to live in, paranoia and secrecy. One of the only things Elisa signs to him is that he is a good man. And he is. Pretty much the only flaws I saw in this film were in the characters of Strickland and Zelda. Both play stock characters, the over the top insane villain by Michael Shannon and the feisty, sharp black woman by Octavia Spencer, respectively. The first definitely seemed overdone and the latter was a little cliche for me, especially with the line, ""What am I doing, interviewing the help?"" (must be a reference to Spencer's 2011 Academy Award winning role). Unexpected laughs, mostly from my favorite character, Giles. ""Cornflakes were invented to prevent masturbating."" Giles goes to a bakery everyday to collect Key Lime Pie he hates because he likes the owner. He tries to force Elisa to eat it with him, but it gives her a deep green tongue. Another time is when Elisa continuously signs ""Fuck You"" to Strickland, clearly driven to near madness, demands Zelda to translate, who tells him she is saying ""Thank You"". In the final scene, as The Asset comes back to life after he shoots him several times, Strickland exclaims, ""Fuck. You are a God!""Giles is an advertising artist and sketches gorgeous pictures of the creature. He watches black and white musicals, which leads to one of the best fantasy scenes in the film, Elisa and the creature are in black and white, Elisa magically has her voice, and the two of them dance and sing, with a band playing in the background. Old films are often playing at The Orpheus. An important one is ""Ruth"", which features the line most famously read during weddings, ""Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the Lord do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you."" what could be more fitting for this life changing love affair? At first, I had mixed feelings on the ending. The more I thought about it, though, it was perfect, following the theme of an adult fairy tale. Once known only as The Asset to the Cold War powers, the creature is now everything to Elisa. He not only heals her, but transforms her childhood scars into gills, providing her the ability to be with him forever. That is what she wants most of all, after all. When Giles first meets The Asset, he is taken aback and his first words, quite plainly, are ""He's so beautiful"". He is surprised, and maybe we are a little as well. Like Elisa, these characters are not conventionally beautiful. I would say the same regarding ""The Shape of Water"". It is so unique, so weird, so whimsical. A sui generis. But somehow it works. And stunningly beautiful it is, emotionally and visually. #FilmReview"
151,The Shape of Water,8,31 December 2017,Fairy Tale for Adults,"With ""The Shape of Water,"" Guillermo del Toro has crafted a wondrous fairy tale for adults. Many are saying it's not as good as ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but I didn't much care for that movie and liked this one much more. It's anchored by a marvelous and silent performance by Sally Hawkins, as a mute cleaning lady in a government installation during the Cold War who falls in love and tries to rescue a strange, amphibious being who is wanted by both the American and Russian governments. She's aided in her efforts by gay next door neighbor Richard Jenkins and work partner Octavia Spencer. It's notable that the three principal characters are people pushed to the fringes of society because of various things ""wrong"" with them from the perspective of 1960s America: being handicapped, being gay, being black. That a rag tag group of disenfranchised misfits dare to go up against the government and military establishment of a world superpower gives the film both a tremendous rooting interest and mirrors what's happening right now in American culture, in which groups who previously had no voice in the cultural conversation are now being heard loud and clear.The one thing I did not like about this movie is what it chooses to do with its villain, played by...who else?...Michael Shannon. I guess he's meant to represent the white establishment, but del Toro and Shannon take the character too far, turning him into a nightmarish psycho, when really the story would have been more interesting if the villain had remained more of a faceless institution rather than one single crazy dude with a score to settle. del Toro also can't resist the urge to peddle in gratuitous and graphic violence, most of it connected to Shannon's character, and which doesn't really serve any purpose other than to pull the audience out of the movie. The film doesn't need it and would have been better without it.Still, even with its flaws, ""The Shape of Water"" is a visually absorbing and evocative beauty and the beast tale with one foot planted in old Hollywood and the other in our current unsettled times.Grade: A"
152,The Shape of Water,9,29 December 2017,"Part Cold War and part Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Shape of Water is a beautiful adult fairy tale","Today's movie deals with a love between a human and a monster. Many should immediately shout, ""Beauty and the Beast!"", as that's the most well known fairy tale of that same kind of love. When you come down to it, it's seen as bizarre, considering that it's practically two different species that have declared a love between each other. It's a connection that falls off the radar, but you could argue we have connections to a lot of things that are not human. Children love their electronic video games. Pet owners love their dogs. What's different is that those connections are not romantic, but rather mutual. Cinematically, we've gotten a lot more love stories between creatures then we realize. Shrek had an ogre in love with a human. Splash had a man in love with a mermaid. But the biggest example, oddly enough, are monster movies (more specifically, the universal monster classics). Dracula, The Mummy, and even the Phantom of the Opera pushed the boundaries of the connection that love is. The biggest example, though touched lightly, was The Creature from the Black Lagoon. Though I can't say it's a full remake, The Shape of Water seems to tell a story about a gill man who makes that connection with a human woman. It's the early 1960s. Elisa (played by Sally Hawkins) is a mute woman who lives a quiet life, working as a janitor for a government research facility in Baltimore. Her two friends consist of neighbor Giles (played by Richard Jenkins), a closeted gay man who teaches her about old music and film, and coworker Zelda (played by Octavia Spencer) who is also her sign language interpreter for their employer. Her life is changed when colonel Richard Strickland (played by Michael Shannon) brings in a creature he captured in South America.When Elisa comes to clean the room the ""asset"" is, she sees that it's a gill man. She starts to bring it food and even music to show that she means no harm. Slowly, the two become friends as they connect without ever speaking (considering that Eliza is mute and the gill man can't speak). Things look bleak as Strickland, obsessed with the cold war, want's the creature dissected and studied for the space race. At the same time, Soviet spies want the creature destroyed so the U.S. can't get ahead. The race is on to see if Eliza can outwit both sides of the war for her love. While there does seem to be similarities to Creature from the Black Lagoon, I can assure your that The Shape of Water is not only a different film, but a pretty good one to beheld. It's strengths lie within it's story and cast. Despite being very cold war orientated, this story has a fairy tale quality to it. It's director Guillermo del Toro directed a similar project called Pan's Labyrinth, but the goals were similar; to bring tales of beauty and hope within dark times. The Shape of Water is a love story first, and while I won't spoil anything, I can guarantee that I really wanted to see our two characters live together. You really feel for Eliza (who Sally Hawkins is phenomenal as playing), who is figuratively and literally a silent character waiting for her moment to present her voice. That all comes within the gill creature, whose effects are not only amazing (an example at how practical and CGI can work together), but you get a lot of personality from him. He's shy, but open to trying new things. He's a lot like a powerful child who is learning about the human world. These two do make a great couple.Even the cold war elements are really good. The film smartly presents both sides as wrong...yet with people that do want to see good come out. This is also a secret I'll let the film reveal, but it makes me realize how black and white many modern movies about Soviets usually are.I'll say now that The Shape of Water also happens to be a sexual story. I can see a lot of people turned off by this and simply too weird of a love story, but the movie makes it palatable enough that people should see through it's inner beauty.I'll give this nine gill men out of ten. It's definitely a well written, well acted, well designed, and well directed. Fans of Guillermo del Toro, monster stories, and fantasy will like this. Will mainstream audiences get into it? It's hard to tell, but if people can love a beast from Beauty and the Beast, I don't see why they can't also love this gill man. Go see it, and find out if this story of silent beauty floats."
153,The Shape of Water,10,29 December 2017,Raw Emotions,"I don't often write reviews because I don't always know how to express myself. This movie conveys so many of the deep emotions that are inside of me, that I don't always know how to let out. This movie probably is one of the best movies that I have seen in my entire life because of the messages that Guillermo Del Toro can express with his choices of actors, music, and even just the different lighting in different scenes. It is an amazing work of art."
154,The Shape of Water,8,28 December 2017,Beautiful and yet...,"Beautiful story about love, not about getting it, or keeping it, but about love and how it shows up. It is also about love for the movies. Beautifully filmed and acted. However...the story is kind of thin, filled with obvious jokes & pop culture references of the early 60s. Maybe because of Mad Men, maybe because of Apollo 13, maybe because I've seen these references so many times, they have gotten kind of stale. Then, there is the bogeyman played by Michael Shannon. I read his part was written for him. Good for him. I thought his acting was over the top. Maybe it was his eyes? The ending brought tears to my eyes and I stayed for the credits which I rarely do."
155,The Shape of Water,10,27 December 2017,The Princess and the Frog: A Fractured Fairy Tale,"GRADE: A- THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A lyrical re-telling of an age-old love story that is hauntingly beautiful.SYNOPSIS: A mute falls in love with her outer beast.RUNNING TIME: 2 hrs. JIM'S REVIEW: We all know of Beauty and the Beast, a tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme, etc. Mismatched souls who fight adversity and become one. The famed director, Guillermo Del Toro's, takes that most cliche of notions and creates a tender love story about a plain-looking mute servant who falls for a big scaly Creature from the Black Lagoon type. Not the most typical movie fare, granted, but doomed lovers nevertheless. Such is The Shape of Water, a swoon-worthy romantic story that is glorious filmmaking.Pure poetry in fact.It is 1963 during the Cold War. In a hidden laboratory, the government has a top secret experiment in the form of a captive beast. Chained and tortured, this creature searches for the tiniest bit of compassion and finally finds it in a lowly worker named Elisa, a lonely mute waif who also yearns for that human touch...or the next best thing.The director carefully sidesteps the sexuality and walks that fine line masterfully, avoiding any unintentional uneasiness with its sensitive subject matter. He fabricates a totally believable world of romance and longing. Adding to the overall romanticism is an insightful and poignant screenplay by Mr. del Toro and Vanessa Taylor that takes its rather rudimental storylines of espionage and governmental conspiracies and wisely pushes those plot devices aside to concentrate on the relationship of two misfits who happen to fall in love. The dialog and voiceover narration is quite beautiful and touching. Also noticeable is the subtleties of racial tension and homophobia in the plot. Yes, there is much at play in this film.The Shape of Water works its magic with its strong visual images, lensed by Dan Lausten, and a lush romantic score by Alexandre Desplat. The production design by Paul D. Austerberry is exquisite. The muted colors, all teals and rustics, cast a melancholy aura to the story which most effectively transports the moviegoer into a otherworldly universe. ""The world is a lonely place "" it seems to say, and its characters reinforce that sense of desperation and sadness.The entire ensemble is splendid. Sally Hawkins is an appealing presence as Elisa. The actress relies on her facial expressions and graceful movement to convey the character's isolation and angst. She glows with a radiance that embellishes Elisa's pain. Doug Jones is her love interest and he literally provides such fluid movement and elegance to the role. (Kudos to the creature design, an elongated mass of aqua scales and gills forming rippling musculature that enhances the attraction factor. Let's face reality, the surreal story is far-fetched and if the beast were a gelatin mass of ooze or a furry fanged monster, the love story could have been a tad unpleasant and possibly intolerable.) Yet, we too fall under the filmmaker's charming spell.Michael Shannon plays the real monster in the film, a villain with no redeeming traits. He provides the necessary hostilities and is a compelling force that advances the narrative, although one wishes the character was written in less black and white terms. Michael Stuhlbarg is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, an impassioned scientist who sees positive communication with this alien as a breakthrough for mankind and shows the many sides of a conflicted man wanting to do right. As Elisa's friends, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins are simply wonderful. Also memorable is Nick Searcy as the military-minded General Hoyt.As this fractured fairy tale gently unfolds its love story about ""a princess without voice"" and a giant amphibian as her ""frog prince"", it all sounds absurd. And it is. But The Shape of Water exists and works its magic so completely that one longs for it to be real. One of the year's best.ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
156,The Shape of Water,10,27 December 2017,The love story we needed.,"Such a beautifully, weird love story. Also a story of the life of the outsiders of society during the 1960s. The monster in this movie is the ""normal"" everyday man. The main character Elisa never speaks, as she is mute, but she makes one feel with the emotion she portrays with her eyes and body language. In a world and time where someone like her would be seen as less than, she lives a comfortable life in a world of her own making. She seems to lack a certain something, a sense of fulfillment, maybe. 
All of this changes when ""the asset"" is brought into the government lab, where she works alongside her African American friend Zelda, as a janitor. Seen by everyone else as a thing, Elisa treats the Amphibian Man with kindness and develops a friendship with him. 
Other than this love story, the Shape of Water portrays a 1960s world where kindness is found in the other, outsiders, and malice is found in the ""normals"". It is a beautiful movie to look at, with a plot that flows."
157,The Shape of Water,8,26 December 2017,A magical movie,"THE SHAPE OF WATER is the most romantic, beautiful, charming, weird and wonderful love story that I have seen in a long, long time.The fact that the love story is between a mute woman and the Creature from the Black Lagoon makes it just that much more interesting.From the fertile mind of Guillermo Del Toro (THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, PAN'S LABYRINTH), TSOW answers a question that a young Del Toro had when he first saw the 1950's creature feature CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. He thought, ""what if the creature ended up with the girl?"" In Del Toro's mind, the Creature was the leading man, not the generic hunk that was hunting him.Wonderfully realized by Del Toro, TSOW tells the tale of mute cleaning woman, Eliza (Sally Hawkins) who works at a ""secret Government agency"" in Baltimore. When she is asked to mop blood up in a highly classified area, she soon realizes that a ""creature"" is being held there. It is her realization that this creature is not just ""some creature"", but an intelligent being that starts this lonely, mute woman and the ""creature"" on the road to a loving relationship.Hawkins is mesmerizing as Eliza. Obviously, with her character being mute, she must express herself in other ways - and she does. Her eyes are truly the window to her soul and Hawkins' ability to ""eye act"" is astounding, she conveys more feeling with a look and a glance than most actors can with a mountain of work.She is strongly aided by some really good co-stars - Richard Jenkins is marvelous (as always) as Eliza's neighbor/friend who, himself, has a handicap - he is a gay man in the 1950's. The strength of Jenkins' performance is that he is able to overcome the trap of ""the sympathetic gay best friend"" and bring to the screen a complete character. Michael Stuhlbarg is watchable (as always) as the main scientist that studies the creature. Here is an actor that has grown in my eyes and he is a ""must watch"" in anything he is in. Michael Shannon is a presence as the main ""heavy"" in this film and though his character is pretty one-note, Shannon hits that note strongly and holds our attention. Unfortunately, compared to these 3 (and Hawkins' lead role), Octavia Spencer's talents are not put to the test as Eliza's co-worker. She is capable of so much more and her character is severely underwritten.But, while strong characters are a must in a successful film, it is Del Toro's direction and ""sense of place"" that embue this fable with the character and detail it needs. Set in a 1950's that is a bit more idealistic/stylized than is real, Del Toro steers us through a world that is fascinating to watch - and be in - and makes it seem almost plausible that such a creature could exist and that a woman could fall in love with him.Much like how I fell in love with this film.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
158,The Shape of Water,,26 December 2017,A visually stunning thriller,"I'm a fan of thriller movies, and among all the thrillers I've ever seen, ""The Shape of Water"" is definitely one of the best in terms of visuals. The cinematography, production design, visual effects, and music score are all top-notch, making the viewing experience rather pleasant. It is surely a strong contender in the technical categories of the coming Oscars. The acting performances are also noteworthy. Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins and Michael Stuhlbarg all give unforgettable and natural acting. Michael Shannon proves again why he is one of the best actors in his generation by perfectly playing the villain. The storytelling and character development, on the other hand, are not that satisfying. Overall speaking, the pace is fine and taut. But the third act is overlong, and some interactions between ""the thing"" and humans (after people rescue ""the thing"" from the lab) are completely unnecessary. The director may try to make the audiences emotionally resonant, but fails in the end. The love between Elisa and ""the thing"" looks especially strange: no human wants to make love with a monster. The character development is largely disappointing in the sense that almost every character is flat and one-dimensional. All in all, I would give the film a 75/100 rating."

161,The Shape of Water,10,25 December 2017,The Shape of Love,"""The Shape of Water"" is beautiful. Writer and Director Guillermo del Toro tells the story of the shape of love, that it can look any way you can imagine. His screenplay along with co-writer Vanessa Taylor tells the poignant tale of feeling alone in the world, and the possibility of love that we all deserve. Sally Hawkins is amazing as lonely mute Elisa discovers her greatness within, her voice. Hawkins is so moving in her visage and silence. ""The Shape of Water"" is the strange love story of Elisa and the noble amphibious-man Creature. Discovering that the Creature's life is threatened, Elisa implores her dear friend Giles, played by compassionate Richard Jenkins, to help save him. Through sign language Elisa says, ""When he looks at me, he does not know how I am incomplete. He sees me as I am."" That breaks your heart. Elisa just wants to be loved. She just wishes to be gotten. We all do. ""The Shape of Water"" eloquently expresses humanity. Awesome Doug Jones literally inhabits the Creature through CGI effects and all. His languid movement and gentle expressions illuminate the noble Creature's generous heart of the one, who loves Elisa back. Dan Lausten's cinematography mesmerizes. Elisa is the janitor along with her friend Zelda, played by strong Octavia Spencer, on the midnight shift at the secret Government facility in Washington D.C. set in the 1960's during the height of the Cold War. The story set mostly at night has brilliant tones of gray and muted lighting in the midst of this touching love story fable. Del Toro gracefully balances the dichotomy of the narratives. Lausten and del Toro create the astounding images of Jones's shimmering regal blue Creature, nearly human enough for us to cheer on. Amazingly del Toro's world of ""The Shape of Water"" is mostly light or dark, little gray. The light is Elisa and Giles. Narrator Giles opens the tale of ""the princess without voice"". Jenkins's Giles is the old unemployed commercial artist, who suffers over his sexual identity. Brilliant Michael Shannon as Government Agent Strickland is the dark. Strickland captured the legendary Creature from the Amazon bringing him back to DC to uncover his secrets. He mercilessly tortures the Creature. In the meantime the Russians are also interested in the mysterious ""asset"" and pursue him as well. Strickland represents the one downside of del Toro's narrative. As embodied by Shannon, Strickland is clever, cruel, vicious and insufferably pious. He is also bigoted. He has no nuance. Greater villains are much grayer. Though gray comes in the form of wise Michael Stuhlberg as Dr. Hoffstetler, the dedicated scientist who seems stand for the Creature. We first see Hawkins's Elisa awake to begin her janitor night shift. She sets the timer to boil her eggs while she routinely pleasures herself in the bath. Elisa bares telltale scars on her neck. She packs two bagged lunches, one for her apartment neighbor friend Giles (Jenkins). She smiles and takes her bus to work. Hawkins is understated power in how she expresses Elisa's profound loneliness and hopefulness without saying. Much of the beauty of ""The Shape of Water"" is in the unsaid. Being with the Creature though unlikely as it seems, we get that it is Elisa's ""perchance to dream"". Hawkins harnesses Elisa's authentic desperation, and her great heart touches us with the lighter side of our humanity. ""The Shape of Water"" is the fantastical love story fable. The great fables allow us to enter that world of wonder. ""The Shape of Water"" is the possibility of love no matter what it looks like. That is the world worth visiting, and perhaps living in as well."
162,The Shape of Water,8,25 December 2017,True love knows no bounds,"12/24/17. Saw this in the theater today and it was worth the price of admission. For those who remember the Creature from the Black Lagoon, then this one's for you. It's a sequel that was well worth the wait. Well, it's not exactly a sequel, it's more like a theme in variation. It's a love story of strange proportions, that is worthy of del Toro's imagination. Hawkins is a sad woman of a certain age, who does janitorial duty at an oceanic research facility. She does not speak, but she can hear. She falls in love with a creature dragged in my Shannon's character. And, typical of sci-fi/creature features of the '50s, anything that is not human deserves to die. Hawkins makes it her mission to save the creature while falling in love with it. Implausible? Sure. Romantic? Absolutely. Catch it for Hawkins's star turn. Let's hope she wins something for this role."
163,The Shape of Water,10,25 December 2017,"Guillermo del Toro works his brilliant Cinematic 'Magic' (plus abundant Compassion) again with Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer & Doug Jones (and Michael Shannon) supelative!","Wow...... ""The Shape of Water"" proves once again that Guillermo del Toro is certainly among the most gifted & genuinely artistic Directors (and Conceptualists) working in films today.As with his earlier masterpiece ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (El laberinto del fauno) Guillermo del Toro brings multi-layers of complexity and significant meaning to ""The Shape of Water"" primarily being a heartrending (although highly unorthodox) 'Love Story' ...........but perhaps even more importantly revealing deeply-poignant insights within the (partially broken/ lost) hearts & Souls of endearingly-eccentric characters simply searching for a measure of empathy-connection while traversing darkened realms of the unsympathetic & apathetic 'real' World.Of course Guillermo del Toro has the astonishing ability to take complex moral-dilemma's (and emotional upheavals) adding-in historically resonant back-drops (in this case early 1960's Cold-War) while weaving uniquely-compelling storylines within profoundly-moving and indelible character studies.In the case of ""The Shape of Water"" focusing on the beleaguered 'Elisa Esposito' who works the night-shift as janitor at the highly-secretive 'Occam Aerospace Research Center' (poignantly & realistically portrayed by Sally Hawkins). 'Elisa' is unable to speak (i.e. mute but not deaf), and communicates solely thru sign-Language, fortunately ""Elisa' has a compassionate friend/co-worker named 'Zelda' to share the grave-yard shift hours with (the fantastically-charismatic Octavia Spencer works her magic here again!)...... and after-work watching old-Classic movies along with intellectual, artist/neighbor, movie-aficionado 'Giles' (Richard Jenkins).Even with the caring company of 'Zelda' and 'Giles' - 'Elisa' experiences bouts of loneliness, and desires true companionship..... but her inability to verbally 'speak' is of course a bit of a hindrance to finding personal-happiness (this film definitely gives the viewer the impression that 'Elisa' has basically felt 'ignored' and under-valued throughout her entire Life).'Elisa's Story-arc certainly begins to change the Day a new research 'subject' is brought into the Lab = a large aquatic 'creature' that we only receive glimpses of at first, but one who seems to possesses humanoid form? 'Elisa' is intrigued, and begins to earn this creature's 'trust' by bringing it hard-boiled eggs to snack-on, and record-albums of Music to listen/dance to?,,,, these early interactions between Elisa and the Gill-man (expertly enlivened by Doug Jones, who has brought many of Guillermo del Toro's creatures to vivid 'life') are extremely poignant as the audience begins to realize that this humanoid-amphibian exhibits abundant intelligence + curiosity + genuine emotions, soon endearing itself to Elisa (and vice-versa)....... these significant interactions eventually transforming the initially meek-mild Elisa into a steely-eyed, resolute Lover & 'protector' of the Gill-man (under-siege by those who would rather dissect him in the name of Cold-War scientific supremacy).There are many more developments (in terms of both Love & intrigue) and the intimidating Michael Shannon perfectly-portrays the 'take-no-prisoners' Col. Strickland (out for amphibian blood), along with Michael Stuhlbarg as the seemingly compassionate scientist (with a secret) who also plays a pivotal role here.In summation, ""The Shape of Water"" is one of the Best, most emotionally-complex and highly-imaginative movies I have seen in a long time...... one that most definitely lingers and deeply-impacts the viewer's heart & Soul....... but with the brilliant Guillermo del Toro at the helm, I expected no Less!"
164,The Shape of Water,9,25 December 2017,An imaginative piece of storytelling and a work of art,"The Shape of Water is another fantasy-morality drama from Guillermo del Toro with the imagination and ambiguity of his Pan's Labyrinth, though with less engrossing storytelling. As a movie, I see it as a cross between Creature from the Black Lagoon and Splash with moral themes and compelling cinematic imagery.The core plot is that a man-like, amphibian creature has been found in the Amazon basin and brought to the US for study in a government lab. The time is the mid 1960s and so the creature is a desirable ""asset"" for the US and Soviet governments in their Cold War contestings. Kept in a holding tank, the creature is treated as an animal until discovered by Eliza (Sally Hawkins), a mute janitor. Eliza, personally suppressed from her disability, finds sympathy with the creature's situation and forms a relationship with him. While she's supposed to be cleaning the lab, she feeds him eggs, plays music for him, and teaches him sign language. When the government authorities, represented by Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon), decide to kill and dissect the creature, Eliza and friends facilitate the creature's escape. This central plot of ""escape of an intelligent, sympathetic, fish creature who is loved by a human,"" struck me as the basic plot of the 1984 Tom Hanks comedy, Splash. The similarity extends to the creature's cruel confinement and unsympathetic study, and even to the shedding of its scales in misery. Now, Splash was a good movie and certainly not original in its genre. I don't fault del Toro for using a similar plot device to drive his movie because he took it beyond that device. Rather than just entertain us with a thriller storyline, he incorporates theme and imagery to say something.The Shape of Water's central theme is a solid, Good vs Evil, extended to Misfits vs the Deluded Normal. Again, maybe not so original, but well done. The sets evoke the pre-digital 1960's with massive machinery and systems in a lab controlled by human technicians rather than computers. It all has a ""dirty"" look indicating that a large cleaning crew is required to keep it up. While that does stretch the believability of facility security (something innocuous in today's world) it is part of the fantasy and a needed plot device to put Eliza in proximity to the water creature.The movie's look complements the Fantasy vs Reality theme that is also prevalent in Pan's Labyrinth. Here, it's seen as transitions between black-and-white and color scenes. In an opposite take on The Wizard of Oz, however, the fantasy scenes are the black-and-white ones, reflecting the fantasy depicted in the old musicals seen on the characters' TV sets. Even here, though, del Toro blurs the edges with a scene set in a movie theatre where The Story of Ruth is playing in bright Technicolor. So, with such changing cues, where do we find fantasy and reality? Maybe in people's actions, or maybe we can't.There is also a religious theme that stems from the movie's consideration of Good vs Evil. We see a black-and-white view of God in Strickland's hubris where God is a white male human. Hence, in this view, the amphibian creature cannot be more than an animal (nor can people of color, represented here by Olivia Spencer's character). Playing against that, is the evoking of The Story of Ruth as a tempering Bible story where an autocratic God is not featured and the dominant theme is compassion.As a master cinematographer of fables, del Toro uses his medium to depict his themes rather than pontificate with dialogue. Having his protagonists being a mute and a creature unable to speak underscores this and urges us to finding the proof of things with our own eyes. And so we see the Perfunctory vs Compassionate theme in the sex scenes (yes, this movie earns its R rating), and the delusion of Escape vs Reality in the TV broadcasts of musicals and Vietnam news footage.Where the movie touched base with Creature from the Black Lagoon is in its depiction of the amphibian creature. Mr. del Toro chose to use an actor in costume for this character rather than CGI. That was a good move. Mr. del Toro's creature bears a resemblance to the Black Lagoon creature, even to the point of the webbed fingers with claws. Its ""breathing"" gills enforces that resemblance and allow the creature to be fearsome when required. Overall, though, he is depicted as another sympathetic and obvious misfit. Someone should win an award for this costuming. While The Shape of Water is a fine example of movie-making, it has its flaws. It doesn't draw us into its characters as much as Pan's Labyrinth did. The evil is more institutional rather than personified (Michael Shannon's Strickland comes off as more crazy than evil, as opposed to ""the Captain"" in Pan's Labyrinth), so we don't feel the threat to the characters as much. Also, the ending felt ""forced"" and gratuitous. Still, what I did like about the ending, was its melding of the ""happily ever after"" ending of Splash with the ambiguity of Pan's Labyrinth. The Shape of Water makes its mark in rising above the general fare of ""blockbusters"" offered by Hollywood. It is thoughtful with themes beautifully expressed in its visual medium. Those themes are classic in storytelling, but are progressive when compared to those in the current run of movies that seldom go beyond cliche and propaganda. I heartily recommend this film as an imaginative piece of storytelling and as a work of art."
165,The Shape of Water,8,24 December 2017,Another Beautifully Visual-Driven Film from Guillermo del Toro,"One of the most impressive parts of The Shape of Water will probably go unstated by many, because it is easy to overlook. It is stunning how much chemistry a woman who never talks and a fish monster can have. The energy between them radiates, and I had to keep stopping myself to consciously think about what a feat that truly is. As a direct result to how great the writing, directing, and performances are, this relationship between a woman and a monster never feels strange. If done by lesser talent, this could have come across as very weird or wrong. But del Toro crafts this film in such a way that it never comes across in this manner. In fact, in feels only natural, and that is applause-worthy on his part. That is the single biggest thing that Del Toro needed to pull off flawlessly, and he rises to meet the challenge. As with every Guillermo del Toro movie, the production elements are all spectacular. Del Toro really has a great understanding of mise-en-scène, something I'm continuously taken aback by every time I watch a movie of his. His cinematography isn't usually something that lunges out at you and calls attention to itself; rather, it works to very subtly draw you into the film. I do very much like cinematography that stands out and pops, but there is also something to be said for more the subtle kind of shooting a film. Del Toro has a strong hold on his production design. From the set design to the costume design to the color palette, every del Toro movie has a clear direction that is unique to its own story, and this film is no exception..."
166,The Shape of Water,10,23 December 2017,"""Life is made of the shipwreck of your plans.""","In brief, with Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water, it's like how you might see a hacky critic say it: I laughed, I cried, I watched the other (first) awesome Doug Jones, and witnessed one of the most gorgeous and moving films of my lifetime. Maybe one of those isn't the usual thing, but you get what I mean.Longer: Del Toro is a filmmaker so engaged with how people make choices in stories and how the world around them and what is inside them is sometimes at odds and other times really not so, and how that steers a story in a particular direction. Fantasy is often his vehicle and it's to the point where he is so engaged with it that he deals with it directly as reality, or at least he gives it that texture; this is a film where reality and fantasy coalesce into something that is so tactile, pure, wondrous and it's unlike something you've seen before while being reminiscent of many things you've seen before. Pan's Labyrinth was one such way of going about that, and The Shape of Water belongs into that pantheon of a master working with a sharp focus on what he wants and having the cast and craftsmen to pull off his vision. The movie may belong to a lot of actors actually - Michael Shannon's sympathetic and yet hateful ""big bad wolf"" in this aquatic 60's cold-war spy-tinged fairy tale; Michael Stuhlbarg's Russian agent who actually has a lot of concern for science and what this creature could mean past its ""icky"" insides; Octavia Spencer as someone who on the surface appears to be the chatty best friend type (not unlike in a movie that might have come out in the 50's and 60's, whether she would have been played by a black actress I don't know, possibly not), and has to endure the same kind of racism mixed with sexism as nearly all women then; Richard Jenkins, getting many award nominations and deserves them all, as a closeted artist who is not defined by his sexuality (his hair is as much of importance as who he finds attractive, or his cats) - but, with all those noted, it's the Sally Hawkins show. She commands this with a face that is warm and inviting and a little quirky (maybe like a more tolerable Amelie, I'm sure silent comedians or Giuleta Massina from Fellini's films works in there too), and when she listens to people not like her or the typical-to-1962 worldview she's curious and definitely not dismissive. Oh, and she pleasures herself too, so the sexual active part is not submerged, so to speak.So when this Amphibian Man character, the most creative homage to Creature from the Black Lagoon since that film came out, is engaged by her, it's not like some kind of thing that's too overly quirky or about their differences (so, as good as this movie was, it's not Starman for example). It's about two outsider souls coming together, physically and emotionally (but, at times, certainly physically, though the most, uh, tasteful depiction one might care to see), and how the world around them is... well, it's a fish-man, kill it with fire! Actually, that's how it would have been in the previous generation, and Del Toro knows this. Moreover, he connects that to the political temperature of the period, which is, frankly, a mood that is not unlike at all what we have now. It's a distinctly American story too, and coming from a Mexican filmmaker that's not to be underestimated.But what makes The Shape of Water so remarkable, among the towering pieces of cinema this decade, is how seemingly effortlessly the emotion runs through this thing, and how Del Toro and his cinematographer and production designer and composer Alexandre Desplat and Doug Jones and so on, manifests that in total cinematic terms. He brings us through every step like a storyteller should to get us to empathize with most of these characters and even, dare I say, understand and see Shannon's guy as a tragic figure, the ""All-American"" who's been force-fed a lot of garbage and not only accepts it but wants to live up to it (a scene where his boss explains what decency means to him is the most 2017 scene that will ever be, but extends past that). This is a world that is not all wholly original and doesn't pretend to be - Hawkins and Jenkins live above a movie theater for (Fish-Man) God's sake - but it's sincere in a way that other filmmakers might have found cheaper, or even to the point of not trusting (or simply seeing at all) an actress like Hawkins can be this person. This is beautiful work on all the levels a piece of cinema should be, alive and provocative politically, romantically, in gender, in just how to LIVE in this world with one another. And, maybe, how to look at how we view ourselves in relation to God, or Gods or whatever."
167,The Shape of Water,9,23 December 2017,A breath of fresh water,"Few filmmakers have the ability to present a story in a way that is unmistakably unique these days, in the swirling miasma of cookie-cutter movies that are exhaustingly predictable and rely heavily on pyrotechnics and CGI to make up for the lack of heart. But Guillermo del Toro fills The Shape of Water to the brim with a genuineness rarely seen.Set in 1960's Baltimore, this story is a bit Romeo and Juliet, a bit Beauty and the Beast, except in this instance the beast is the one that appears outwardly normal. A mute custodian with a case of curiosity killed the cat syndrome (Sally Hawkins) becomes entangled in a tug-of-war between American and Soviet government powers after she discovers a creature being held hostage by the facility she works at, and her endlessly kind heart won't allow herself to let them use it as their pawn. The villain of this story, Strickland (Michael Shannon), proves to be one of the most complex characters. He serves up no shortage of the aforementioned beastly qualities, projecting his frustrations of his failings as a man and subsequent own self-hatred on everyone around him in a variety of ways. Torture, intimidation, emotional manipulation, racism, verbal and physical abuse and sexual harrassment are all employed by him, even a lack of basic hygiene is displayed as he fails to wash his hands after urinating in the first scene the audience is properly introduced to him. Despite all this, del Toro and Shannon still manage to make it clear that while this character wields a considerable amount of power, we get quite clearly the feeling that he is also powerless - a sad, joyless man with a lack of connection to his family and a lack of any kind of fulfilling relationships in his life, grasping at threads of power in the hopes of catching one and somehow finding the innate sense of pride and worth he has always been searching for. People respond to him out of fear rather than out of respect. He is a puppet of the system, under the thumb of greater authority and he knows it. It fills him with a rage that he takes out on anyone who either earns - or doesn't earn - his ire.Elisa (Hawkins) shines with a genuinely heartfelt performance. Meek and often terrified of the brutality she sees around her, but also tough in her own way, the audience will find it difficult not to like her. Entirely without verbal dialogue, Hawkins is successful in portraying the kind spirit, gutsy strength and quirky personality of Elisa. Likewise, her screen partner The Asset (Doug Jones) delivers a very convincing portrayal of a creature that's not quite man and not quite animal. He moves in a unique way that is signature to Jones but yet has a quality (and statuesque figure) also reminiscent of the god that some of the film's characters wonder if he is. Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and Giles (Richard Jenkins) are the perfect kind of kindred spirits, with Giles being a realist and Zelda being motherly at the appropriate times that Elisa needs them to provide that for her. Like her, they share qualities that render them ""imperfect"" in the society of the time; Zelda is a woman of colour, Giles is gay, and all of them have a greater than average sense of empathy.Particularly and curiously impressive is the way opposing elements in this film fit so perfectly together - drama, horror, comedy and even whimsy-filled musical routines all somehow work in harmony with each other in a way that feels very natural. The fairy-tale elements are balanced carefully with the more adult aspects of the story, so while there are certainly some tear-jerking and frightening moments, viewers still leave at the end with a feeling of magic and inspiration. Plausible and implausible scenes and elements work so well together that the audience can easily accept the story for what it is.The only real criticism to put forth is that the development of the relationship between Elisa and The Asset is patchy - we see snippets of their admiration for each other growing, but then it seems to take a leap between friendship and deeper intimacy that the audience feels a bit left out on. The film follows Strickland and Giles' characters more closely as far as interpersonal relationships go, something that the film could have used more of for greater development of Elisa's character and deeper understanding from the audience of how much she has really suffered. The character of The Asset is never truly developed either - however, this may be very intentional as del Toro stated in previous interviews that the creature represents something different to everyone. Perhaps it is up to the viewer to decide what he represents for them. In some ways, this renders the character an eternal victim - always being used for something by someone. For governments, a weapon; for Giles, an artistic muse; for Strickland, a punching bag to offload his anger onto; and for Elisa, a recipient for her love and intimate desires. Although the creature reciprocates her affections, we can't shake the fact that he never really initiates them, just follows suit, leading one to wonder what decisions he would make in that matter (or any) if he had the freedom to do so.With all its complex beauty and freshness, The Shape of Water is a must-see for those wishing to experience a film that's truly new, and to feel the true soul that comes forth in it."
168,The Shape of Water,8,22 December 2017,A tour-de-force of Guillermo's del Toro's world-building ability,"The Shape of Water stands out for the way Guillermo del Toro is able to give this fantasy-laden film such a distinct time and place, in this case a military research facility set in the 1960's, which highlights del Toro's masterful screenwriting ability. The writing is further gilded by its intellectual depth, with characters remarking about the origin of certain words and names, or drawing on biblical references to better frame the predicaments they're in. And if del Toro only wrote the screenplay, he'd still be receiving acclaim, yet this entire production is his. All told, he's credited as the writer, director, and producer.The film exhibits an alluring, Amelie-like color profile, with water motifs throughout, featuring a career-making performance by Sally Hawkins. The selective use of nudity and sexuality adds a real sense of depth and fullness to her role, making the character seem that much more lifelike, and Hawkins certainly makes the most of it.Her performance is quite simply magnanimous. She's outwardly tender and sweet, with an inner strength and resolve that manifests itself whenever the occasion calls. It's a combination of perfect casting and the actress rising to the occasion that, in my estimation, places her as the odds on favorite to win the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an actress in a drama, for which she's currently nominated, and the Academy Award in the same category, for which she most certainly will be nominated."
169,The Shape of Water,7,22 December 2017,"At times, we all feel like a fish out of water...","Saw this film as a rare in-theater experience, with my 15 year old boys. They both gave it enthusiastic two fingers, errr thumbs, up. It is a love story, albeit one as you know from the poster with a creature from Del Toro's subconscious.The film floats fairly smoothly, and perhaps for that reason I found myself drifting towards Michael Shannon's character. And yet they pile villainous vices upon him a tad too much for my taste. A befuddled Richard Jenkins adds sweetness beyond a piece of pie or three.It's easy enough to lie back and enjoy the clever creativity of Del Toro, and the soundtrack is a nice blend of incidental music with songs from a simpler era (with more intricate dance steps.) Will Ms. Hawkins be another Oscar award winner rewarded for being female and mute (isn't that some kind of weird Hollywood tacit thing).For what it's worth, I would have been fine seeing this on a small screen, although it was nice for the boys to enjoy it in proper fashion (and as a break during their finals week to boot!). By the way it is a R-rated film, with a couple of sex scenes...which is not a huge deal....but one of them has somewhat of a violent edge to it, and it is NOT one of the interspecies scenes. Anyways, something for parents though I suspect I'm not alone in feeling like 15 years olds can vary from feeling like 12 to 18 year olds. By the way we talked about it afterwards and they felt it was not a big deal.As for the film overall, again gorgeous and such a tremendous opening scene, the trailer we had all seen long ago maybe set my sights a little too high, but on my own amphibious DNA I swear Blade Runner 2049 is a far richer picture."
170,The Shape of Water,8,20 December 2017,"An engaging, if predictable, ""fantasy for adults""","While we know that some monsters are decidedly not lovable, the creature in Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water, like many humans who roam the planet, is more of a lonely outcast seeking connection than a life-threatening presence. Performed by Doug Jones (""The Danger Element"") underneath all the prosthetics, this monster is an amphibian humanoid known as the Asset, captured by scientists from the Amazon (the one in South America) to help with the U.S. space program. Amphibian man (as he is listed in the credits) resembles a cross between King Kong and E.T., though definitely not as cuddly as the latter but a much better dancer. The Asset is also an unabashed romantic who loves hard-boiled eggs, which is even strange for a human and enjoys Benny Goodman which is not as strange but, as del Toro says, ""What is ridiculous can also be sublime."" Sublime or not, The Shape of Water is an engaging if predictable ""fantasy for adults"" as del Toro characterizes it. The film explores the connection between the amphibious man and Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins, ""Maudie""), a mute janitor who works the night shift in the Occam Aerospace Research Center. Elisa lives by herself in Baltimore in an apartment above an old-fashioned movie palace that plays biblical epics in Cinemascope to a few remaining diehards.Set in the early 1960s during the Cold War, stereotyped forever as an age of social conformity, the film seems to be a warning to those who look back on the golden days with starry eyes by showing us how a part of our history has been marked by racism, homophobia, and xenophobia. In the opening scene, Elisa is asleep in a room filled with water as the narrator, whom we later find out is her neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins), describes her as a princess in a fairy tale and Alexandre Desplat's score persuades us that the world is filled with childlike wonder, but it is a hard sell. As Elisa awakens from her dream, she goes about her routine - making hard-boiled eggs, taking a bath, making sandwiches and watching TV with Giles who is a gay commercial artist and has just lost his job for reasons unspecified, but we can guess. Though unable to speak, Elisa communicates at work with Zelda (Octavia Spencer, ""Gifted""), a supportive friend and co-worker who knows sign language. Elisa's routine undergoes a radical shuffling when the Asset arrives in a pressurized water tank. Controlled by arch-villain Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon, ""Nocturnal Animals"") who carries a cattle prod and who we quickly realize is the real monster in the film. Strickland plans to send the Asset into outer space where, if he wasn't lonesome before, he will now really know what lonesome is. The self-righteous and bullying Strickland is responsible for protecting fish-man from the Russians who he fears may snatch him to either kill him or use him to gain an advantage for their space program.
 
Tentative at first, Elisa senses that she has something going with the Asset and teaches him sign language which proves he has a good head on his shoulders as well as other functioning body parts. She then introduces him to the hard-boiled egg which he devours and soothes him with the music of Benny Goodman as they do a perfect imitation of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. Underneath her outward persona, Elisa has a big heart and big ideas. Once she learns that Strickland wants to cut her new friend open to better understand how he breathes, she makes plans to capture the sexy creature and put him in her bathtub until he can be released into the ocean at high tide. Aiding her in her scheme are the Russian mole, Dr. Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg, ""Call Me by Your Name""), Giles, unfortunately stereotyped as being weak and fearful, and Elisa's dependable friend Zelda who joins the group as a late arrival. The heist itself is genuinely exciting and the strongest part of the film with much of the pleasure seeing the expressions on Strickland's face. From the capture, there is the chase, and then the romance which is unorthodox to say the least, all taking place as the sadistic Strickland displays fewer and fewer redeeming qualities. The Shape of Water has some lovely moments and unique special effects, and the inclusion of pop songs from the 1940s such as ""Hello, Frisco, Hello's"" ""You'll Never Know,"" and Glenn Miller's rendition of ""I Know Why (and so do you),"" from the film ""Sun Valley Serenade"" help to capture the aura of nostalgia. Unfortunately, however, the film's potential is thwarted by one-dimensional characters who hammer us constantly with a message that we have already figured out. While The Shape of Water shouts ""magic and wonder,"" it ultimately falls short of conveying it."
171,The Shape of Water,7,20 December 2017,I'm in love with the Shape of you.,"When The Shape of Water started rolling the opening credits, I thought to myself, what could I have gotten myself into? Something about this particular project seemed beautiful, but completely off-putting, even in 2017. There is no secret as to what this film is. A semi-erotic romance picture about a woman and an amphibian humanoid. You might say it's Guillermo del Toro's Beauty and the Beast, as put through the lens of a 1950's Universal Monster Movie, or perhaps there's something more? I take it that del Toro, despite being a well-versed horror movie historian, wasn't just taking a trip down memory lane. I still can't put my finger on what, but The Shape of Water is a provoking piece of art. With all the gorgeous sets, special effects and ensemble cast, I saw the film with an audience of people that weren't necessarily pleased with what they saw. The Shape of Water is no crowd pleaser and I believe del Toro wanted it that way.The film takes place in the early 1960's. Hawkins is a mysterious figure. Elisa Esposito. A mute woman who works as a janitor at a government lab. Surrounding her is a world of stereotypes. Her partner at home is Giles, a starving artist and closeted homosexual with a tendency to hoard Key Lime pie, played impeccably by the great Richard Jenkins. Octavia Spencer plays Zelda Fuller, Elisa's loyal friend from work. Then we are introduced to Colonel Richard Strickland, the film's clear antagonist. He is our Gaston. The straight, broad shouldered, bigoted white man who discovered the poor amphibian creature, and rather than being fascinated by it, he simply wants to crush it for being different. While he's a villain that's easy to hate, there isn't much nuance to his character in comparison to Jenkins and Spencer. He's a brutish thug and that's about it. Although, I got a kick out of his candy addiction and his willingness to dislocate his blackened, gangrene-infected fingers out of anger. del Toro is a brilliant absurdist.Any time Hawkins and the creature shared screen time, either together or by themselves, I fell in love. Hawkins is a revelation. She says not a word, but projects an emotional performance louder than any acting job you saw at the movies in 2017. I couldn't keep my eyes off of her. She mesmerized me and filled my heart with joy. The creature is an odd updated version of The Creature from the Black Lagoon with fantastical healing powers and a rather nauseating way of copulating. Her romance with the creature comes from a place of loneliness. Two souls, misunderstood and rejected by the world. They were meant for each other. A love so powerful that Hawkins even strikes up the courage to sing ""You'll Never Know"" to it in an unexpected musical number. On the surface, you might say the lesson of the story is ""love isn't skin deep"". True as that may be, you will never get over how odd it is to see Hawkins fall for that terrifying frog monster. But that's the point. Guillermo del Toro doesn't want you to feel aroused. He doesn't even want you to shed a tear for the protagonists. The Shape of Water is entirely a visual experience and a trip through the imagination of a world unlike ours, but placed somewhere in the not so distant past. It isn't reality or fantasy, it's that unrecognizable grey area in between. It's only up to you to figure out what it all really means."
172,The Shape of Water,10,20 December 2017,One of Guillermo finest work !,"Just saw The Shape of Water and it a masterpiece.
This movie is so beautiful it so tragic and magical.
The actors are amazing and deliver some really good performances, performances that's actually deserve to be nominated. The visuals were stunning the quality of the image was epic. The direction was done perfectly. One of the weirdest but most beautiful love story I have ever seen. This movie was a dream I felt different watching this movie. The romance was touching the characters were so charming. The gory stuff was really welll done it followed everything, it felt like a real life situations even if the main story was about a monster. This movie was just so well done it deserve itself a nomination at the Oscar for best Picture ! Watch it, it can be hard to watch but it beautiful just give it a try and give it time it no Action movie, it a good movie a must see !"
173,The Shape of Water,,19 December 2017,Guillermo Del Toro creates one of the most cinematically beautiful epics of our time.,"Water gives life. Guillermo Del Toro's ""The Shape of Water"" is all about love and life. Few filmmakers create films where you sense the work of a director in every shot, and Del Toro does exactly that. Through his brilliance and creativity, Guillermo Del Toro places himself as one of the best filmmakers of our time with this masterpiece. Set during the Cold War, the mutant janitor of a research facility named Elisa (Sally Hawkins) falls in love with a test subject, which happens to be an amphibian-like creature similar in many ways to a man. With help from her friend Giles (Richard Jenkins) and Zelda (Octavia Spencer), Elisa risks everything to try and save the creature from the wicked government agents trying abusing him, specifically Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). Del Toro's unusual love story is simply beautiful. We get many gorgeous shots of water in many forms, symbolizing the different forms of love found throughout life. Del Toro isn't emphasizing that people-creature relationships should be socially accepted, but rather uses their relationship as a mechanism to convey the multiple complexities and layers of love and life. Del Toro crafts a truly beautiful film dedicated to the art of cinema, shining in his details and poetic signatures. Each performance is remarkable, notably the wickedness of the great Michael Shannon and the richness of Sally Hawkins mute but brilliant performance. ""The Shape of Water"" is not only visually beautiful due to its breathtaking cinematography, but conveys a beautiful test on life and love and how love itself takes many different shapes."
174,The Shape of Water,9,19 December 2017,Life is But the Shipwreck of Our Plans,"Whether it be Creature from the Black Lagoon, Beauty and the Beast, Edward Scissorhands, or even Her from a few years ago, movies about forbidden love are a common theme in romantic films. And if done right, they could be extremely effective. The Shape of Water stands as a fresh take on that tale, and yes it works really well as a romance between a government controlled creature and a mute custodian.Driven by emotional performances, The Shape of Water feels simple in premise considering we have seen similar stories (mentioned above) almost every year. But it all comes down to execution. Director Guillermo del Toro frames this story as a good guy-bad guy situation, but certainly rounds out each character with emotions and just enough depth to care about every scenario.In that way, the original screenplay by GDT and Vanessa Taylor could be among the best written this year. Every scene has importance and the 2 hour runtime is perfectly paced. There are also several actors who turn in Oscar caliber performances including lead Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, and Michael Stuhlbarg. I would have to go through the other films and put together a list of Oscar predictions, but all actors mentioned above have a chance at a nominations.GDT has a knack for making gorgeous looking films and The Shape of Water is no different. Everything from the creature played by Doug Jones to the production design and cinematography, this is easily one of the best looking films of the year. To that note, I don't really have a complaint with the film. Performances, writing, directing, visuals, and romance are all way above par. These uniquely executed films are always something I will cherish, and I'm glad GDT was able to bring this to screens, especially before the Fox-Disney merger. It really makes you wonder if we will even get these types of movies once that deal goes down. One can only hope.9.0/10"
175,The Shape of Water,8,18 December 2017,"""Life is but the shipwreck of our plans""","""The Shape of Water"" (2017 release; 123 min.) brings the story of Elisa. As the movie opens, we see Elisa getting ready for work. She and her friend Zelda work as janitors at a restricted government research facility. Along the way, we learn that Elisa is mute. Then one day, a new ""asset "" is delivered to the research facility. Mysterious at first, we learn quickly that it is some sort of amphibious creature. Elisa is immediately drawn to it. But the guy running the research project, a no-good scientist named Colonel Strickland, and his boss General Hoyt, have other ideas... What will happen to the creature? At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest fantasy story, if not fairy tale, from Mexican writer-director Guillermo del Toro (""Pan's Labyrinth""). Here he brings us a story that in its essence is a variation of ""Beauty and the Beast"", or even ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and the original (1932 and 1976) ""King Kong"". The movie is set in the late 50s or early 60s (at one point, on of the kids asks if he can watch Bonanza), and in fact the overall feeling of the movie is as it it was made in that era, rather than today. The Location of Elisa's apartment, above the Orpheum movie theater where ""The Story of Ruth"" and ""Mardi Grass"" are playing, only increases that overall late 50s/early 60s feel. The set productions is first rate all the way. The way del Toro directs the movie reminded me more than once of Steven Spielberg. Sally Hawkins is outstanding as Elisa. That makes two noteworthy movies this year for her: earlier this year she was equally stellar in ""Maudie"", but watch her pile up the nominations for this film come the awards season (she already picked up a Golden Globe nomination). Last but certainly not least, there is a wonderful orchestral score composed by Oscar-winner Alexandre Desplat, and I'm going on record that he will score another Best Movie Score Oscar nomination for this.""The Shape of Water"" opened up this weekend at my local art-house theater on not one but two screens, a rarity. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, I'm happy to report. Given the overall quality of the movie and the nice counter-programming to the inevitable blockbuster that is ""The Last Jedi"", I can see this having long legs at the art-house theater circuit. Every day Elisa picks up a ""thought of the day"" from her wall calendar, and on a certain day the thought is ""Life is but the shipwreck of our plans"", and that certainly also seems to be the case for this movie, but in the best possible way. ""The Shape of Water"" is a WINNER."
176,The Shape of Water,8,17 December 2017,The Amazon's freshwater but whatever,"This is an entertaining, even charming fairy tale, if you can suspend not only disbelief but also knowledge and critical faculties. The story appears to have been inspired by ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" although it is a fantasy/romance rather than a horror movie. It has many similarities to Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" so if you liked that movie, you will probably like this one. Like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" it has a horrific torture scene, but unlike that film also has graphic sex. This is not a movie for persons under 14. The main theme of this film is the outcast. Set in the early 1960s, it ties together the lives of a variety of social outcasts including the amphibian monster. Del Toro and his crew do a good job creating the setting and mood. The acting and the costumes are stellar. Then why can't they get some basic geographical and historical details right? A creature from the Amazon lives in freshwater, not saltwater. The Soviets recruited Americans to be moles; they didn't somehow graft a Russian into America and have him pass as ""Bob."" The Bob/Dimitri character was beyond ludicrous (although if he had been presented realistically as an American or as a Soviet double agent his character would have been realistic and more compelling. It's sad because I liked the character). Again Hollywood insults our intelligence. But despite all I enjoyed this film, seeing it as a simple fairy tale on a child's level despite the sex and violence. If you like fairy tales (and I do) you will enjoy it."
177,The Shape of Water,,14 December 2017,"It's fantastic, lyrical, beautiful, and lyrical. It might get the Oscar, so SEE IT.","""This may very well be *the* most sensitive asset ever to be housed in this facility."" Fleming (David Hewlitt)If you consider writer Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (2006), you might call him a visual genius, a poet who transcribes myth into reality. Now in his beautifully-written/directed The Shape of Water, when Elisa (Sally Hawkins) falls in love, it's with a fish, actually a large amphibian that can love her back, and the result is sweet.That is until the government of early-sixties figures Amphibian Man a political liability and the lovers become fugitives. Undoubtedly inspired by The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), The Shape of Water is a lovely fantasy fable set in the Cold War, where a simple janitress, who is mute and an outsider like her Amphibian, struggles along with him to be accepted for the love she chooses.I'm misleading you; the exciting struggle is mostly against the narrow-minded forces of convention and authority, which see the fish as a threat to national security, but just as much inscrutable and dangerous because of being misunderstood. In that xenophobia lies the similarity to today's political climate which threatens our history of tolerance because of ignorance. Just as odd-looking foreigners threaten our way of life, so too does Amphibian Man, whose value as a specimen to be studied is compromised by foreign agents who do not wish us to benefit from research.Strickland (Michael Shannon) is the weak authorities' security guy, who doggedly pursues Amphibian out of duty as much as ideology. His glee using an early version of a stun gun on the fish is a reminder of the rabid torture sanctioned by modern ""safety"" obsession.Although I have made this film out to be a sci-fi political thriller, it is even more of a love story along the lines of a thinking-person's Beauty and the Beast, far more modern and human, possibly closer to Frankenstein, whose monster in the Mary Shelly novel is almost lovable in his ignorance and yearnings. When Strickland seeks out to destroy the Amphibian and his love, he states the mantra of ill-considered radicals everywhere, even in politics: ""I deliver."" He could be Potus fulfilling a campaign promise or just plain evil. In either case, Beauty is always vulnerable and Beast, well, not meant for this ""civilized"" world."
178,The Shape of Water,7,11 December 2017,Love at the interface between water and air,"It's romantic, it's blue-gray-green, it's wet, it's passionate. It's really hard to classify. This film defies any form of convenient categorization, as is typical with the adult fantasy fables crafted by Guillermo del Toro, he of the visually poetic mind. This is lush romance, adult fairy tale, violent cold war thriller, supernatural fable, dark comedy, social justice parable, and horror film, all in one lush, wet, subterranean visual dance.Del Toro has mixed those ingredients before (with the exception of the dance number dream sequence), most beautifully in his master work from 2006, ""Pan's Labyrinth."" And he brought captivating, otherworldly mysticism to sequences of the two Hellboy films he directed. His films glue the eyes to the screen. You cannot look away.Here, not all of this exotic mix works, but the parts that do work, Really work, and are decorated by lush production design by Paul Austerberry, many shades of blue-gray-green. A joke is made about it when a ""teal"" car gets purchased in the plot. The love affair is the most effective thread, in an extremely powerful way, as a mesmerizingly emotive Sally Hawkins plays Elisa Esposito, a cleaning woman who is mute. She befriends the ""Asset,"" played with great physical grace by Doug Jones, an amphibian man who is the subject of a cruel government experimentation program under way in a murky underground lab in Baltimore. Think Creature of the Black Lagoon treated as a Cold War asset. The Amphib-man is intelligent, peaceful at heart, and is graced with amazing healing powers, he was worshiped as an aquagod by the locals in the Amazon basin, before he was captured and brought in a tank to the States.Elisa yearns for a soulful connection, and as she joins the overnight cleaning crews at the lab, she draws the Amphib-man out, tempting him with hard-boiled eggs and Benny Goodman records. She teaches him Sign. He teaches her about his pure heart. The year is 1962, and the lab's secret government staff seek a leg up on the Soviets. It's thought the Amphib-man's unique twinned breathing systems could yield an advantage in the space race.That thread is mostly window dressing, it doesn't work so well as did the fight between partisans and fascists in the Spanish Civil War context that was so deftly applied to ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but it serves to lay out a twisted homicidal antagonist, a true believer, Col. Strickland, played by Michael Shannon with sadistic perversion. It's amazing to contrast these heavy roles he gets now with his part as Fred, the Wrestle Mania fan from ""Groundhog Day."" As Strickland blithely tortures the Amphib-man and domineers his yellow-housed family, Elisa flies under his radar and enlists her coworker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and best friend from her apartment building, Giles (Richard Jenkins), to spring the Amphib-man from his laboratory prison, with an assist by a sympathetic scientist, Dr. Hoffstetler, played with a proud ethical posture by Michael Stuhlbarg, amidst a subplot of Soviet spying (which also doesn't work so well; I would have preferred more of the budding human-Merman romance thread).Spencer's Zelda is the film's incisive comic relief, and she can read Elisa's moods in detail, setting up a mirthful exchange when Zelda discovers that Elisa has ... consummated her bond with the Amphib-man. The line, and the explanatory miming, is flatly hilarious, I won't spoil it. Zelda is Elisa's workplace touchstone, her defender and translator, her unquestioning friend. Spencer hits a home run with the role, another one for her after ""Hidden Figures.""Jenkins is also fantastic, as professional illustrator Giles, fired from his ad agency because he's gay, and bereft of the special contact of love, which is also Elisa's condition. She struggles to express to Giles why she loves the Amphib-man: ""When he looks at me, he does not see how I am incomplete."" (Her muteness.) ""He just sees Me."" Giles, too, is beguiled by the pure heart of the persecuted merman, despite an unfortunate incident with one of Giles' pet cats. The tragedy of the story is the emotional weight of being alone, a condition shared by Elisa, Giles, and the Amphib-man. None of them are complete, all of them yearn for contact.About Doug Jones, he of the virtuosity in acting while clad in layers of prosthetic latex: he was the magical Faun, as well as the monstrous Pale Man in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" he was another merman, Abe Sapien, in the Hellboy films by del Toro, and now he's Lt. Saru in Star Trek Discovery. All roles in which his height and athletic posture help him act sensitively while covered in layers of prosthetics. In this film, he's like Elisa: mute from the human perspective, but his vocalizations are appropriately intense (which were credited to del Toro).Del Toro simply does not make Hollywood formula films. Every item he directs winds up being a singular entry of entrancing strangeness, some working better than others. But every one of them unique and special. I wonder what he might do with a conventional script, something not immersed in the mists of fantasy. But then again, he seems most happy plumbing those shrouded, tragic, romantic depths. More power to him."
179,The Shape of Water,8,10 December 2017,"Auteur Filmmaking with a Capital ""A""","I just love movies like The Shape of Water. Not because it's particularly imaginative (it is) or because it's decorated to the brim with lavish costume, set and creature design (it is), or even because it's thematically ballsy (it very, very, very much is). No  I like movies like The Shape of Water because it is a rare glimpse into the mind of an original creator, cashing in most of his good will and gambling his professional reputation on a film he/she has nearly complete control over and that encapsulates everything they like and care about. George Lucas did it for Star Wars (1977), Christopher Nolan did it for Inception (2010), Zack Snyder did it for Sucker Punch (2011) and now Guillermo Del Toro has done it for The Shape of Water.The film takes place in a fable-esque early sixties Baltimore amid the height of blind consumerism, social conformity, oblivious futurism and Cold War paranoia. Elisa (Hawkins), a mute janitor working the night shift at a top secret research facility forms a deepening bond with their latest test subject  an aquatic humanoid creature with amazing abilities. But when the creature's handler Agent Strickland (Shannon) decides to kill and dissect the creature, Elisa, along with some unexpected allies form a plan to rescue the creature and keep it hidden until it can be freed.The Shape of Water is first and foremost a compendium of very interesting, very different ideas all melting into fine bubbly brine. It's part monster movie in the vogue of Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), part sweeping romance in the mode of Romeo and Juliet. There are shades of 1950's opulence, 1930's escapism and bit of 1960's civil unrest seething just out of frame. A little of Pan's Labyrinth (2006), a little Red Scare cloak and dagger stuff and an overall feel that conjures memories of playing Bioshock when I was a teen (though that last one may not have been purposeful).Even if none of those particulars appeal to you, the craft and detail in this film can hardly disguise the unbridled passion that's infused in every retro-verve window pane and dingy aquarium. This is not just a world you can touch but one you can feel as exemplified by, among other things, Alexandre Desplat's wistfully nostalgic score and Guillermo Del Toro and Vanessa Taylor's mood-setting screenplay. The result is a strong, consistent tone that evokes a feeling of longing for a forgotten past that may have existed in another dimension.Story-wise, the film more-or-less unravels exactly how you'd expect with the only surprises coming in the form of visceral extremes. This may arguably be one of the film's few weaknesses though considering it unravels like a fable, you can't really blame it for following through on its tragi-romantic precepts. Every time we as the audience are lulled into a sense of complacency, the film punctuates the moment with short bursts of gruesome violence, sleepy flights of fantasy and/or, shall we say unique sexual circumstance. These moments of adult content, rather than distract, amplify the overall experience like large crystals of sea salt on sweet caramel. It plays out like a dark, bloody, carnal fable whereby true love is a given and monsters are there to be vanquished.The largest monster in the film is Michael Shannon who plays the menacing Strickland. From one point of view, he's a dedicated family man, a patriotic American and an incorruptible company man. Yet his ruthlessness betrays him, showing that his inner core is just as rotten as his fingers, which the creature bit off and doctors haphazardly reattached. In this situation and in the eyes of Elisa, he's a villain of biblical proportions.Though not to be outdone in the monster department, the distinctive 6' 3'"" Doug Jones manages amazing feats as the amphibian creature. Behind layers of makeup and prosthetics the giant figure has the same level of expressiveness as the demure Sally Hawkins only with occasion to be primal when the need arises. Hawkins, Jenkins, Spencer and Stuhlbarg are all given a chance to imbue their characters with an inner life. Where in lesser hands they'd be relegated to stock, here the black maid becomes the privileged gatekeeper, the communist stooge becomes the moral arbiter and the gay confidante becomes the fallen man given new life.This bring me to the films larger flaw  because we're given so much time to get to know everyone, some of the more romantic moments come across a little unearned. This judgment isn't entirely fair given a lot of ""romance"" movies suffer from the same problem, but not every movie has an amphibian creature playing paddy-cakes with the gal from Paddington (2014). I for one would have liked to see a few more scenes of them getting to know each other before Elisa goes ALF on everyone's a**es. Of course adding a scene or two may ruin the pacing of the film, which is as artfully maintained as everything else in this film.Even at his worst director Guillermo Del Toro knows how to use film language; to make us feel for those tap-dancing across the screen with dreamy grace. The Shape of Water is with little uncertainty one of his best and most powerful films to date. It is a beautiful looking, lovingly crafted and as previously mentioned ballsy movie featuring some of today's best ensemble acting and best Auteur (with a capital A) filmmaking. As of now The Shape of Water is on limited release but if it's playing at a theater near you, you should definitely check it out."
180,The Shape of Water,,7 December 2017,Brilliant directing job by Guillermo del Toro,"The Shape of Water is brilliantly directed by Guillermo del Toro and is set in the Cold War era of the 1960's. The U.S. Military has found a creature in the jungles of South America, an Amphibian Man (that looks a lot like the 1960's monster, The Creature From the Black Lagoon), and they want to use it as a military weapon against the Russians. The Russians want it too. That's the big picture the film hangs its hat on.The deeper story is about Elsa (Sally Hawkins) and how her lonely life changes when she comes into contact with the ""secret experiment"" that the government is keeping in a military facility. She and her co- worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) are part of the cleaning crew and it doesn't take long for them to discover that there's something different going on at the military facility.It seems odd, but the movie is also a love story. Elsa sees the cruelty that the government's project head treats the amphibian man with (the sadistic head of the project is played by Michael Shannon) and she sneaks into his holding area at the facility to show him kindness and to show the amphibian man he's not all alone. The theme of loneliness runs deep thru the movie. At home Elsa lives next door to an artist (Richard Jenkins) who's character is a gay man in the 1960's. They are both each other's only friend. The characters are all well developed and del Toro gives you a good insight into the lives they are all living. Octavia Spencer is stellar in the movie. While Sally Hawkins character Elsa, who was born not being able to talk, is the main character, it's Spencer's character, Zelda, who keeps the movie moving along. It seems odd but the interaction between Elsa and the monster is beautiful. It's a fairy tale love story like in Beauty and the Beast. However, the movie seems to go off the rails for about thirty minutes with a fantasy scene about a musical (the monster actually dances) and a few other scenes that would be a spoiler for the film. But overall the movie has way more good stuff than bad.The Shape of Water is rated R for nudity and graphic violence and has a run time of 2 hours and 3 minutes. On my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" I rate this movie a LARGE."
181,The Shape of Water,7,8 December 2017,Creature from the Black Lagoon never looked so good.,"Here's movie that preaches tolerance. It's a love story between a speechless girl and an aquatic creature. Never mind where will they live.The movie looks great. Beautifully photographed exquisite sets and an outstanding use of music lift this movie above the crowd.Thinks go wrong with the movie when Michael Shannon as a way over the top villain, relentlessly starts shooting. The movie goes way off the rails when it begins to deal with God like qualities of the creature. Some scenes are unintentionally funny.The movie plays well on the big screen and should be seen in a theater. Strong performances and technical achievements will be recognized in the award season. Dive in to this unusual melding of genres."
182,The Shape of Water,10,8 December 2017,One Of My Favorite Movies Of The Year,"""The Shape Of Water"" is the new project from writer/director Guillermo Del Toro who brought us Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, The Hellboy Movies and to an extent The Hobbit trilogy (which gets to much hate). I wasn't a huge fan of Crimson peak, but the Shape Of Water really looked intriguing from the trailers. I sat there blown away by what I was seeing. This is one of my favorite films of 2017. It is unique, original, interesting, intriguing, and weird all at the same time.Sally Hawkins gives a really great performance in one of the most inspirational performances I have ever seen. her character is mute and has no lines of dialogue aside from a dream sequence, but man does she play this character with confidence. The supporting cast also does a really great job, Michael Shannon of course being the next standout, and no one phone sin a performance at all. This film has that old school vibe to it. There is a use of a lot of practical effects, and the makeup and hairstyling is some of the best I've seen on film this year. The amphibian creature, if it is motion captured, is seamlessly integrated into the movie that the use of practical effects looks so appealing.The set designs are also really great. Lots of little details that you have to pay attention to that you wouldn't normally pay attention to. The lighting in these scenes also adds a lot of depth to the movie. There are scenes that are dim for a reason, and some with more lighting for a reason. It is really a great way to use lighting to convey the details of the environment. This is a story that grabbed me from the beginning. Not once was I bored watching this movie. It kept me engaged and there is so much character development that it ended up making me care at the end. Out of all of the characters that you root for, there is not one single character that you end up not liking.And if my memory serves me correctly, there is not one scene of exposition in this film. Not one. There are some ""hints"" here and there as to what is going on in the background, but from what I remember it's not explicitly stated. It leaves it up to you to put together all of the clues and I really like that about this film.I'm happy we got something original in Hollywood. Everyone craves for something original, and then everyone hates it when something original comes out. It was a nice breath to just see something so refreshing instead of plot threads being retreaded and following clichés that we see in movies nowadays. This is one of my favorite films of the year.I am going to give ""The Shape Of Water"" an A+."
183,The Shape of Water,10,7 December 2017,Beauty and the Beast. Girl and the Gill-man.,"Beauty and the Beast. Girl and the Gill-man. Guillermo del Toro's THE SHAPE OF WATER is a charming, funny, sensual and horrific love story and the best film Guillermo has done since Pan's Labyrinth. It's a hilarious 1950s Soviet-era sci-fi romance with a very nice, bloody touch of horror.Elisa, a mute woman played by the adorable Sally Hawkins, works at a top secret laboratory in Baltimore as a cleaning lady. Every night she visits THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, who has been captured and is being experimented on by the evil Strickland played by Michael Shannon. Elisa falls in love with the creature and she has to get the creature out before he's killed.The brilliant DOUG JONES plays THE CREATURE. He's a perfect interpretation of Universal's Gill-Man. This could be a sequel to the original Black Lagoon film. Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer are also charming supporting roles."
