0,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,10 September 2005,A really Grand Day Out  and A Close Ten!,"I saw it at a German press screening. Without giving too much away: Most critics really seemed to like it very much. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. From my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. It keeps the charm and wit of the three W+G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. Of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to ""An American Werewolf in London"", ""Jaws"", ""King Kong"" and even to Peter Jackson's ""Braindead""/""Dead Alive"", but also to other genres.Characterization was better done in ""Chicken Run"", but that movie had a complete new ""cast"" where introduction was necessary. Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. So, the new ""Wallace and Gromit""-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. ""Chicken Run"" had the more convenient, but also more ""storytelling"" plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more ""isolated"" feeling of the W+G shorts. Children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because Gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs... :-) ). But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). The movie manages, like ""Shrek 1+2"" and ""The Incredibles"", to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a British and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of American animated movies.The animation is  as expected  superb, and they kept true to the Aardman style because they didn't put in too many digital effects - I realized just a few when it came to Wallace's inventions.Finally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is ""borrowed"" by Randy Edelman's ""Dragonheart"" score.The bad thing is: It will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from Nick Park & Co."
1,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,10 September 2005,Cracking!!!,"Being a ""Wallace and Gromit-fan"", I was looking forward for this full-length movie. Surprisingly I saw it at THE world-premiere in Vlissingen (NL), at the Film by the Sea festival. A wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and merry movie. It's about Wallace and Gromit (whom I believe don't need an introduction) having their own pest-control company in the city which is hosting a giant-vegetable contest in a few days. Everyone, including an eccentric baroness, is hoping his or her giant carrot or melon will win the Golden carrot. Unfortunately the town is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits. This is where W&G come in. The have their own cracking contraptions to control these cute creatures in a human way.It's a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who liked the three proceeding short movies of W&G (which are more than great!), will love this full-length movie. Nick Park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense for humor. Like in Chicken Run, it truly amazes me how he can capture so much story and emotions in just a few frames. ""Job well done, lad"" ;-) Oh yeah: The music was fantastic! It really completes the ride. Enjoy!"
2,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,9 September 2005,Fun for the whole family,"This first (and hopefully not last) Wallace & Gromit feature lives up to expectations. There are plenty of jokes (some a bit cheeky) as well as some great tributes to past Science Fiction movies. With the barrage of awful and formulaic movies being spewed forth from Hollywood it's great to see such a great film like this that's enjoyable for almost everyone. If there is any justice it will be top of the box-office and be at least nominated for best animation at the next Oscars. The animation is wonderful; the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great fun. This is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy. Charming, clever, fun and well made, what's not to enjoy?"
3,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,23 October 2005,"Excellent entertainment, superb characters and great detail","There are a few aspects to Park's movies, and in particular Wallace & Gromit, that I would say make them so great. The first is subtlety and observation, the flagship of which is the character of Gromit. He doesn't speak, he doesn't make any noise, all he has are his eyes, brow, and body posture, and with these he commands the film. Park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. The comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the subtlest of movements and it works superbly well.Watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen. Normally you'll be guided to things in the movies, the screen won't be cluttered too much, there won't be many things to take your eyes away from the main clue or action. Park seems to need to look the other way with his movies. He throws extra content at his audience, there's action in the background, to the side of the screen, even off screen, and there's just about always something in the foreground to catch your eye. His movies are about multiple viewing and discovery, they're layered with jokes and ancillary action.Throughout this film there are layers of things happening on screen, jokes in the foreground maybe on a jar label and background shadows that give away action. You can imagine that for Park the movies has always been an event, and the movies he loves are ones which he wants to watch again and again. This is what shows in his movies, and in through his most beloved characters.Then there are the bizarre and wacky inventions which Wallace make, something which is reflected in the storyline and the twists and turns of the plot, everything is bizarre and off the wall, yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world. You can imagine that inside Park is the mind of Wallace.There's also one more thing that make these movies so unique, and that's the modelling and precise hand animation. I must admit I was concerned when I knew Dreamworks was involved in the making of this movie, and I thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the forefront. What I was scared of was Wallace & Gromit becoming CGI entities, or at the smallest, CGI being used to clean up the feel that the modelling brought to the movie.Not so. You can still see thumbprints and toolmarks on the characters, and far from distracting from the movie, this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen.So what of the movie? Well I must say that the plot twist was something I had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise, but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit. Actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything, and it had me just as sucked in as if it was a thriller, yet all the time I was laughing.Watching the movie was fascinating in various ways. To see the animation completed, how wild the inventions are, how Wallace is going to get into trouble and Gromit get him out, where all the cross references are in the movie, and where all the jokes are! I must admit afterwards talking with my friends I couldn't believe how much I had missed.There's something different in this movie than with the others, there's a new level of adult humour in here, and I don't mean rude jokes (although there are a couple that are just so British you can't help laughing), I mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face. The kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like Pixar. This just adds even more appeal to the movie.Okay though, let me try and be a bit negative here. I didn't notice the voices in this movie, you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognise them? Well I was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they were...okay, that's not negative. Let me try again. The main plot wasn't as strong and gripping as I'd expected, and I found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves...again...that's not a bad thing, the film was just so much rich entertainment.I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie, probably the worst thing I could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitive...until the final title! Really, that's the worst I can say.The story is a lot of fun, well set-up, well written, well executed. There's lot's of fantastic characters in here, not just Wallace & Gromit. There's so much happening on screen, so many references and jokes (check out the dresses of Lady Tottingham), cheese jokes everywhere, jokes for all the family. The characters are superbly absorbing and you'll find that you've taken to them before you realise. There's just so much in this movie for everyone.There's so much I could say and write about, but I know it will quickly turn into a backslapping exercise for Park and Aardman, it would also just turn into a series of ""this bit was really funny"" and ""there's a bit when..."", and what I would rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie, to go see it, and to experience the whole thing for yourselves. I will say though that the bunnies are excellent!"
4,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,10 October 2005,"A Grand movie, and a Very Close Shave to perfection, Curse of the Were-Rabbit is totally entertaining from start to finish","Wallace and Gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted. The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes ""A Grand Day Out,"" ""The Wrong Trousers,"" and also ""A Close Shave"" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. Winning several Oscars and also countless other awards, Nick Park became quite the popular man in the U.K., yet his impact on the United States has not been big. After the third Wallace and Gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie, yet for years nothing had happened. Then in 2000 instead of a full-length Wallace and Gromit film, we get another brilliant claymation film from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, which almost got nominated for best picture in the Academy Awards. Perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project.5 years later (these kinds of films do take long you know) and a lot of anticipation, Wallace and Gromit finally hits the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie delivers in so many ways. This film will be a delight for both kids and parents. With tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults. This rather difficult technique is one that only Pixar has already perfected and DreamWorks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. Despite the DreamWorks logo slapped onto the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations.Wallace and Gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately. Their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople. To add to that, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of Victor. Simple plot yes, but there is more than meets the eye, be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way, kind of like in the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons.In animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film. Despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. There is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice. Even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. Whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible, or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film, most Curse of the Were-Rabbit's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late. Just picture the movie Madagascar, except funnier much fewer pop culture references, and better animation.Casting was great, even though in a film with not much dialogue, it was not that important. Peter Sallis yet again does a wonderful job as Wallace, even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime (The Wrong Trousers: ""It's the wrong trousers Gromit, and they've gone wrong!""). Ralph Fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit ""Fight Club"") lends her lovely voice as she plays Wallace's love interest. Even though nothing could top the final chase in ""The Wrong Trousers,"" Curse of the Ware-Rabbit did have plenty of action scenes, including one fantastically done chase scene between Gromit and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, the rabbits really steal the show at some moments. Whether it is their cute expressions, their funny movements, or their howling, the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the ""cursed"" rabbit himself, to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter.Bottom Line: Despite not being as memorable as ""The Wrong Trousers"", this film is just as good and entertaining as Chicken Run. Unlike almost every movie to come out this year, the movie does not drag at all, clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun, it will leave everyone watching it asking for more. There is very little wrong with the film; it was a pure delight to watch. This film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar, uncut, raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-Year-Old Virgin, Wedding Crashers, and Sin City) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; that is a good thing. Highly recommend, this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade. Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit: totally harmless fun from second 1 to second 5,100."
5,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,7 September 2005,Better than Chicken Run,"A very enjoyable film. You can see there's much more subtlety in the characters with regard to facial expressions. The voice actors did a great job, and there are some great gags, some of which are not for children, but are not overt in their adult-ness. Much more empathy for the characters in this film than in Chicken Run. Fortunately, the film is still wonderfully British, so has not suffered from Dreamworks' influence on the production. It is also good to see something hand-crafted on the big screen instead of the raft of CG animated films that usually lack a strength of script; that you could see fingerprints in the plasticine in no way detracted from the quality of the production."
6,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,23 October 2005,"I'm ""Crackers"" about this ""Grand"" movie!!!!","When Wallace and Gromit burst onto the scene in their academy award winning short, ""A Grand Day Out,"" they created a fresh new look at claymation. After two more shorts, Aardman's dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. It has an excellent Voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation as only Aardman could do! In this movie, Wallace and Gromit run ""Anti-Pesto,"" a rabbit removal company. When word gets out about a ""Were-Rabbit"" eating all the vegetables in town, a frenzy ensues. Of course, Victor Quartermaine, the town's handsome, toupee-brandishing huntsman, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely Lady Tottington...but can our favorite Aardman duo save the day before chaos ensues?The jokes, I should say, were hilarious. One point, the villain, Victor Quartermaine's, booty-crack was showing, prompting a character to cry out: ""BEWARE...THE MOON!!!"" Vintage Aardman!The characters are crisp and hilarious. Our favorite Aardman team of Man and Dog entertains us as only they could do, earning them their second Oscar (remember ""A Grand Day Out?""). Helena Bonham Carter was terrific as the lovely Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning, toupee wearing hunter Victor Quartermaine. But the one who really stole the show was the priest, whose antics proved to be some hilarious comic relief. Hats off to Aardman for creating another Wallace and Gromit masterpiece!"
7,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,31 January 2006,I didn't know what i was expecting from this movie. A stupid movie?,"I really refused to see this movie. I refused to go with the school and I refused to go with my parents. Just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid, to me anyway. One of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices, ""The Dukes Of Hazzard"" or ""Wallace And Gromit: The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit."" It took me 17 minutes to decide. Time was running out. I had to choose. It came up on the screen ""Few"" as in a few tickets left. By the time we had to line up and get our ticket, only one of us could go in. I desperately wanted Nicholas to go in to see it. But he forced me. I crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that I was going in to see this childishness. I walked in, sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie! must say I was very surprised that I sat through that MASTERPIECE! It was amazing. I don't know what I was complaining about. The Clay Animation was by far the most best i've ever seen in my life. The story was brilliant. About a rabbit disrupting and crashing a carnival that had been planned for over 500 years. Basically Anti Pest Control are protecting the people who are competing in the Vegetable Competition. Anti Pesto known as Wallace And Gromit (Who are in charge of this business) try to keep all the rabbits away from the Vegetable carnival. I wont say anymore. It's just too good to tell. I'll admit that the whole idea of a Were-Rabbit is ab-it unbelievable and ab-it childish, but Nick Park adds substance to it which what makes everyone love it. I mean, there wont be a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely wont be 8 foot werewolves as said in "" Dog Soldiers."" Then again, Were-Rabbits and WereWolves aren't actual creatures. But either way, it worked out very well. The jokes also were more grown up. The kids wont get some of the jokes. It goes way above their heads. It had a lot of British jokes in there. If you love British humor, this is the movie for you.I also loved the cast and the voices. Everything about the movie is so incredibly well done. The direction and pacing was absolutely...FANTASTIC! I recommend this to fans of the old Wallace And Gromit shorts (And no, I haven't seen them yet), and I recommend it to fans who liked ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2 and most importantly, I recommend it to the people who love Clay Animation. Cracking good movie! 10/10"
8,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,10 October 2005,Fantastic Feats of Clay: Wallace & Gromit Save the Day!  Crackin' Good Entertainment!,"WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT (2005) **** (Voices: Peter Salis, Ralph Fiennes Helena Bonham Carter)Fantastic Feats of Clay: Wallace & Gromit Save the Day! Crackin' Good Entertainment!Nick Park, the creator of the animated team of Wallace & Gromit, is a genius. His painstaking art in the form of Plasitcine claymation is a unique process involving literally thousands of hours (it takes roughly an 8 hour work day to contribute 3 minutes of action to a film; this foray into feature length storytelling took 5 years!) in making his lovable master & loyal dog team take form is finally on the big screen in the duo's first full-length motion picture and it's cracklin' good (to coin a phrase from Wallace's usual reply to all things good!) Park, who co-directed with Steve Box and co-wrote with Mark Burton and Bob Baker, sends up the horror genre in this rollickingly funny and swift paced action comedy with the geeky inventive Wallace (voiced by British vet thespian Salis) and his mute yet loyal (and sharper-minded) mutt Gromit (all furrowing eyebrows and mouth-less insouciance) have devised a service to their community: pest control (""Anti-Pesto"" as they are known) for the upcoming Giant Vegetable Festival that has the entire town in the mood for all things vegetative a gigante and the biggest pesk are troublesome rabbits eating the crunchy goods. Wallace's inventive mind has created a vacuum container that is quick, efficient, and more importantly harmless to the cute vermin that plague the estate of Lady Campanula Tottington (voiced by Bonham Carter, making a fast-break to be the first lady of stop-motion animation what with her earlier turn in ""Corpse Bride"" a few weeks ago), who is housing the competition and is a love interest for the nerdy Wallace.The only fly-in-the-ointment is vainglorious, bombastic loud-mouth and jerk Victor Quartermaine (voiced by Fiennes, his first attempt in the animated arts coming across as a Patrick Stewart lunged braggard with hilarious results), a badly toupeed wearing macho moron who is plotting to marry Lady Tottington for her riches while he is a chief competitor to W&G's humane attempts by resorting to his trusty guns and nasty bulldog.To add insult to injury the duo are facing a terrible plight in the form of a huge were-rabbit (the titular monster a nice nod to both Universal and Hammer horror flicks) that is terrorizing the village and devouring every veggie in sight. The two set out to trap and dispose of the creature but there is more than meets the eye as things progress.Relentlessly funny and with such amazing elastic, and kinetic energy to his wonderful clay counterparts, Park and Box have created a truly magical and highly entertaining film with so much amazingly detailed production design to their little world that it may take more than one screening to absorb just how much effort in their blood, sweat and tears have gone into making this instant classic for children of all ages. Wallace, the cheese loving balding inventor, could easily be Homer Simpson's UK cousin with his rotund body and constant knack for getting things wrong while attempting to do the right thing; his heart is in the right place but his head is in the clouds. His sweet crush for Lady Tottington (resembling a pre-plastic surgery Carol Burnett) who is a head taller than our hero will perhaps remind those of their first unrequited love with a smile of awkward admission. His Rube Goldberg-like gift for making the complicated into ease is inspired lunacy that fans will recall from the earlier shorter films ""The Wrong Trousers"", ""A Close Shave"" and ""A Grand Day Out"".But it is in my opinion the wise, silent and long-suffering Gromit, his poached egg eyes of slow-burns and disbelief at what is transpiring, is one of the best animated characters ever created with such an amazing arsenal of exasperated, mouthless expressions and subtle nuances that most live-action actors would kill to accomplish in the attempt of conveying dismay, concern, grief, genuine surprise and relief. His final chase  a signature of the immensely popular comic team  is ingeniously set and quickly improvised especially his literal dog-fight with the equally soundless bulldog with tenacity, wit and a Chuck Jones fueled smartness that would have Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger green with envy.Wallace and Gromit match the best of Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello and any other classic comedy team that comes to mind; here's hoping their longevity continues on screen for just as long as their predecessors. The waiting is most eager."
9,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,8 April 2006,Something wicked this way hops.,"''Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'' is the same type of animation and from the same creators of ''Chicken run'', but the story now is other: Wallace, a inventor who loves cheese and his smart dog Gromit who is always helping Wallace in his problems,are trying to keep the rabbits away from everybody's vegetables,since there is in their town, an annual Giant Vegetable Competition. But when Wallace tries an invention he did, to make the rabbits avoids vegetable, the one who is going to be cursed is him. Before watching this movie I didn't knew that these two characters already existed and were famous.I loved Gromit, and I think he is one of the coolest dogs I already saw.aka ""Wallace & Gromit-A Batalha dos Vegetais"" - Brazil"
10,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,20 November 2005,perfect,"This film is what most of the industry has forgotten how to make: FAMILY entertainment, meaning something which is enjoyable to people of all ages. This particular Wallace & Gromit can be enjoyed by everyone from toddlers who like the colors and cute bunnies to their grandparents who understand the adult references. This film has direction as good as any I've ever seen, and I mean that literally. It is also packed with tiny bits of humor, and each scene has so many humorous details in the background that I'm going to have to buy it, if only in order to read all the signs and handbills in W & G's world. I plan to see this movie at least twice more in theaters, then buy it on DVD. You too should see it."
11,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,7 October 2005,5 years in the making - very impressive,"What-ho! This one is jolly good. I say jolly good, ol' chap. Or should I say ""ol' bean""? My mastery of British terminology is a little dusty. Anyway, my biker boots and I walked into this screening with no prior viewing experience of Wallace and Gromit. I'm happy to say that my boots and I walked out pleased to have made their acquaintance.While not as adult-accessible as Toy Story, W & G still manages to be clever enough to provide the grown ups with a little humor that will most definitely soar over the heads of the young 'uns who are too busy guffawing at the Were-rabbit's belches to have any clue that something is amiss. I highly suggest that you pay close attention any time you see books or words on the screen because there are quick glimpses of puns that you'll miss if you aren't paying attention. My favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the Loch Ness Monster as ""tourist trappus."" If you've ever been known to say, ""I can really relate to Kevin Federline,"" or if you're just illiterate then not only will you miss out on these jokes, but you probably should be spending your time learning to read instead of going to movies. Consider this a public service announcement.The most impressive aspect about W & G is its clay animation. Thanks to the tedious process, it took FIVE YEARS to finish the film! According to the press notes, there were some days when the optimum goal was to merely accomplish 10 seconds of completed film. Folks, I sometimes have trouble finding the motivation to finish responding to a handful of emails or adding captions to pictures for my reviews (a point that is proved by a lack of pictures in this review); so I can't even imagine having the required patience for that.I really like the rough, hands-on quality of the claymation figures. The fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice, personal touch. How can you not be impressed with clay characters that show more expression and emotion than Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves combined? The Curse of the Were-rabbit is, as director Nick Park calls it, the world's first vegetarian horror movie that should entertain both kids and adults alike. Relying on (and as a male who prides himself in his shaggy-haired, cool-bearded masculinity I hesitate to use this word) cute and (oh man, I probably shouldn't use this word either) lovable characters rather than outdated M.C. Hammer references, W & G is proof that DreamWorks can create entertaining animation when it chooses cleverness over the cheap joke."
12,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,26 October 2005,Best Animated Film Of 2005!,"Having just come home from my third viewing of The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought. I noticed a lot of Brits loved it, while those in America just didn't get it. That really doesn't come as any shock, as America doesn't get what ""English"" is.Wallace and Gromit are very English. Middle class English, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure. The film is a lot like our two heroes; simple and unassuming. It has a nice and gentle plot so the children don't get lost, yet there's enough beef there to keep the adults amused too. There's some light innuendo (which seems have to have offended the evangelic - oh noes, drama!) but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment. When people get offended by a plasticine anus, you know the world's messed up...One quick note to those (all American so far that I have seen) who think Chicken Run is a better film: Chicken Run was made to pander to your sense of humour, and I think it suffered because of it. Curse of the Were Rabbit is witty, English, and intelligent. Thomas The Tank Engine's film was ruined because it was made to please the Americans and I'm glad Nick Park did not let that happen to another Great British institution.To sum up: You can keep your Chicken Runs, your Shreks, your Madagasga's - that kind of crude, crass, slapstick comedy just doesn't compare to the wit and grace that is Wallace and Gromit in Curse of the Were-Rabbit. English to the core, and long may Wallace and Gromit stay that way."
13,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,13 February 2009,The World's First Vegetarian Horror Movie Is Outstanding,"'Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit' is one of the funniest and most delightful films of all time. I've always loved Aardman's claymation and their movies. I adore Nick Park's previous short movies of Wallace and Gromit. Gromit is definitely one of my favourite movie characters. Coming back to this movie, the story definitely follows the horror movie trend and pays homage to movies like 'King Kong' and 'Jaws' (just to name a few). The quirkiness and humour is superbly in tune. It has a very British humour. The characters are strong and hilarious.The colourful set designs, props and claymation are remarkable detailed. The music brings an overall energetic feel. The cinematography is great. The voice casting that includes Peter Sallis, Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes is excellent.This is Aardman's first feature film in 5 years since the hilarious and adventurous 'Chicken Run' so perhaps one will have to wait 5 more years before the next movie (as the making does take a considerable amount of time). It has been longer since Wallace and Gromit appeared on screen and it was just awesome to see them back with a new mission. Wallace being the inventer and Gromit as his loyal friend and support, these two form a fabulous duo and I believe any new adventure with them would be worth the wait."
14,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,27 October 2005,flaws are few,"Who can ask for more? Taking my 2 and 4 year old children was a risk, I admit. But well worth it. They were enthralled from credit to credit, with their parents beside them.I have taken the kids to films before with mixed results: too scary, too boring, too sophisticated, whatever. With this film, however, I was glad to see a smart film with wit, style and a sense of passion emanating from the screen. Any film that takes 5(!) years of production to make, good or bad, deserves some respect for the bravery and the patience it takes to film a film like this.O.K. I'm gushing a little. Then again, why wouldn't I get excited? Looking through the movie listing today only reminded me of the poor quality of films that are distributed. At least for the moment Regardless, W & G is a film well made. Perhaps the originality wasn't the most inspired, nevertheless, well told and well paced.Too much adult humour? Too many sex references? Maybe. Though my kids didn't quite catch them. Too young. So, in my case, I didn't really notice.Well, needless to say, I liked it."
15,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,11 October 2005,A new mystery for Wallace and Gromit,"My only problem with The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is that the movie does not take the time to properly introduce Wallace and Gromit to those not familiar with Park's short films. Strangely, ""A Close Shave"" manages to do this with a lot less time to spare. Still, I loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters, human and otherwise. I especially loved Ralph Fiennes voice as the scheming Victor Quartermaine. It is also interesting to see the series on the large screen. The workmanship with the clay characters really stands out. It's a hoot, and great for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs but I have every Wallace and Gromit and will happily add this one."
16,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,18 September 2005,Fantastic movie. One of the best of the year.,"In 1989, Aardman Animations introduced the two heros in The Grand Day Out. In 1993, they fought an evil penguin in The Wrong Trousers. And in 1995, they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in A Close Shave. In 2005, they're back and they are going to fight something that used to be cute and cuddlely in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. In this full feature film, Wallace and Gromit work in Anit-Pesto, a pest-control business. There's going to be a Giant Vegetable Competition, but rabbits keep eating the neighbors vegies. Wallace and Gromit takes care with that problem. But Wallace had an idea. He will brainwash the bunnies with his machine. After doing that, something suddenly eats all of the vegies in the neighborhood and it's big. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the day. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. It kept what the 3 previous chapters had and instead adding a lot of Hollywood actors for voice-overs, they put a no name cast to the job and boy, they did a fantastic job. Wallace and Gromit has not changed. Wallace is still the cheese-loving freak like he always was and Gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog. Also, the script was not too shabby like other family movies were. There is a twist of who the Were-Rabbit really is. The direction from Nick Park (the director of the 3 previous chapters) does a really good job with the storyline. Instead of adding the Hollywood formula in it, he just took the style of the previous chapters and adds a bit of a dark fantasy twist in it. Well done, Nick. The rabbits are also funny and adorable, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is one who has the mix of Wallace in him. The characters were not bad and they weren't annoying, but they'll never top Wallace and Gromit. The animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful. I've never seen a clay-animated movie that is so amazing since Chicken Run. Overall, fans of the two knuckleheads (including the teens) will love this fantastic film. It is a well done film that should get an Oscar next year. Hooray, Wallace and Gromit. 10/10"
17,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,20 June 2009,Endlessly creative and loads of fun,"In one of the early scenes, Wallace and Gromit are called into action on an emergency basis. An alarm sparks the start of a teapot, which then shoots steam into a fan, which operates a machine to wake Gromit up. Meanwhle, a hunk of cheese is brought out to wake Wallace, and both are then launched out of their beds and into an assembly line of sorts. There, they are dressed, served coffee, transported into their vehicle, and they drive off to the scene of the crime.This scene established not only how creative Wallace is with his inventions, it also shows how creative the whole movie is. Nick Park and Steve box create countless images and situations that shine with imagination and wonder. This creative spurt is one of the many joys ""Wallace and Gromit"" works so well.And not only is the film visually imaginative, it has a story that is funny and engaging too. Here, the immaculate duo must save their town from a rabbit infestation that threatens everyone's vegetables, which they seem to take a little too seriously. But when Wallace's experiment to ""cure"" the rabbits of their vegetable eating desires goes horribly wrong, an overlarge rabbit emerges and goes on a nightly rampage eating everyone's gardens.As with the ""Wallace and Gromit"" shorts and ""Chicken Run,"" Nick Park fills this film with good humor that can be universally enjoyed. There are some jokes that are aimed more at adults (particularly in the scenes between Wallace and Lady Tottingham), but for the most park the humor is that which everyone can laugh at. The characters are all very eccentric and memorable, from the priest to Lady Tottingham to the villain Victor (voiced by Ralph Fiennes, who seems to have been racking up the number of villains he has played over the years). Needless to say, this is a winner of an animated picture. It combines great humor with good storytelling, and throws in clever and creative animation."
18,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,20 September 2008,So Fresh It Demands a Sequel,"It has been far too long since I saw the three original shorts of Wallace and Gromit. I did see them once, though: when I was 12 and on vacation. My family was staying in a hotel, and we had absolutely nothing to do; it was Saturday morning, and Cartoon Network aired all three consecutively.Since then, I have been a big admirer of the duo -- but alas, they had not appeared much lately. Chicken Run appeared in the stead of another W&G short, and it was, too, delightful. And my appetite for claymation was fed a little by the short-lived Fox sitcom The PJs. Corpse Bride was another meal of plasticine, but it wasn't terribly clever (however fun).So when I heard of this new adventure of Wallace and Gromit, I jumped at the chance to see it. Moreover -- and to my great delight -- I found that The Curse of the Were-Rabbit was every bit as clever, funny, and weird as the shorts.Ostensibly, this is the world's first plasticine horror film. A scourge of rabbits have overtaken Lady Tottington's hall, and Wallace (head of a humane-minded Anti-Pesto) is called upon to remove them before the big vegetable competition. The picture's antagonist is Victor Quartermaine (voiced by Ralph Fiennes), both the desirous suitor of Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter) and the staunch opposition of Wallace and Gromit. The titular were-rabbit is the result of a horribly botched experiment (too silly to explain here); after the creature's creation, it rampages through the full-mooned nights eating and destroying valuable over-sized crop. This results in an uproar among the townsfolk, who are all seeking first place in the competition. They pit Wallace against Victor -- both of whom not only are seeking to get rid of the were-rabbit, but also to win Lady Tottington.That is, without giving away any details, the plot. Now here is the fun. Besides being a scrumptious visual feast, Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is filled with the silliness of British humor: bawdy sometimes, irreverent other times, but hilarious always. The humor can pacify kids and bemuse adults. What is still most fascinating in the series is Gromit, the adorable dog. Creator Nick Park has fashioned an intelligent animal who never speaks but still says what needs to be said.In 2005, we, the viewers of films, were not offered enough in the way of enjoyable, austere cinema. The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is not a savior, but it is a sign that someone out there has enough creativity to make a smart film, an innovative one, and a popcorn movie all at the same time."
19,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,16 June 2007,"A Laugh Out-Loud Riot--and That's All, Folks!","I'd been a fan of ""3-D animation"" since the days of George Pal and Art Clokey, and I'd thought myself among the apparent few who felt the Aardman short films not so much funny as charmingly quaint, odd and eccentric, very much a product of their environment, whilst displaying great care, even love, and just incredible craftsmanship in their making.Still, the Claymation specials of the Will Vinton Studios struck me as funnier and more imaginative. And if we Yanks appeared to enjoy Chicken Run out of proportion, bear in mind our world-view had also brought forth Stalags 13 and 17. So when I heard W&G would go feature-length, I very much looked forward to the parts but figured the sum would be 90-odd minutes of the same.Wrong-oh! on at least two points. When I wasn't laughing my fool head off I wore a silly or stupid grin (with witnesses). Unlike your garden-variety Pixar flick, where the adults and children laugh at the same time and at the same thing, I actually enjoyed those W&G moments where they just went for the laugh, target audience notwithstanding, and, more often than not, got it. How charmingly quaint, odd and eccentric!The greatest challenge was (and remains) convincing my colleagues to see it. To those too quick to regard me insufficiently young to enjoy this form of entertainment I summoned that silly or stupid grin. To those too quick to brand me ultra-orthodox and a prude I could report that nothing on-screen offended me. And to those who felt compelled to summon an analysis I could only call this film as affectionate an homage to the Hammer House of Horror as Young Frankenstein was to the Universal Pictures classics.But let us analyze it for what it is: That surpassingly rare moment when a production is fun for all involved, on the receiving as well as the giving end. We're all the better for that. We can hope for more. We sure need it."
20,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,13 October 2005,Horror Trousers,"I am always amazed at how many surfaces film has. There seem to be so many places on which an artist can leave us a message. Usually my comments deal with ""normal"" differences in these surfaces: the story compared to explicit commentary on the story, for instance. Or acting in a way that provides a second level on the story. Or a tone or set that does.This Wallace and Grommit stuff is shocking in this context. Oh, claymation is as old as I am (pretty old), but this claymation was designed from the first to be photographed with all the camera tricks you would use in a ""real"" noir or Hitchcock film. That's what made it unique.Once Park crossed into that territory, he had the possibilities to make movies about movies. Many folks do... perhaps a third of all movies have this value, but most take a common approach allowing them to comment on the way others comment on movies. Met-meta movies, but with all this reuse we run out of new ideas.Park has some new ideas. Check out ""The wrong trousers"" where the story is about the mechanics of Hitchcock taking control of the movie and being fought back. Those mechanics are denoted in the story by some automated pants, but the style of the cinematography matches as the battle rages.I guess manipulating that clay for months to get a single scene gives you lots of time to think about movie-making. Last time around we had Hollywood intruding with ""Chicken Run."" It was self-referential, but of the stupid kind: lots and lots of obvious references to other movies. Mel Gibson.This time we go back to the world of characters reinventing themselves. This time the fight is with having the monster genre taking control instead of the Hitchcock one.Sure, most of this can be seen as simple kiddie fun, and it is. But look at the very first shot where we see the copper's ankle stepping from behind the camera. You won't see anything like this in any Dreamworks drek. That was a shot that tells us who love movies that this is first going to be fun for movielovers.The story is as incidental and vexing as a rabbit infestation.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
21,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,17 October 2005,A smashing return of Wallace and Gromit,"Wallace and Gromit is back and this time they're not window cleaners. They run Pesto, a company that provide service to the people of the town that need protection from rodents that feast on their vegetables. This all due to the annual upcoming vegetables competition. It's all jolly good until a were rabbit with a menacing appetite surfaces. From there on it's pretty much a joyride with well written puns and hilarious great parodies ranging from King Kong, Evil Dead, Matrix and Werewolf flicks in general. The movie is excellent in all regards and the clay characters of this movie contribute to making the characters more human than those of the animated counterparts. Far better then Chicken Run and more back to the greatness of Creature Comforts and the original Wallace and Gromit series. It's great for all ages and should be seen by all."
22,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,15 October 2005,Excellent family flick!,"A very cute movie!!! Well made with some hidden adult humor, but not in your face with it!! I must say I was very entertained and pleased with the script and humor in the movie. If you liked the little jokes the Chicken Run offered, then The Curse of the Were Rabbit will be right down you alley! Some jokes are pure English, but the cool claymation animation is a trip down memory lane and I, for one, am pleased to see it! Be prepared to have a theater full of kids which will increase the noise, but it's worth it because of this delightful little movie made me giggle all the way through it!!! The tongue and cheek delivery of all the voice actors is noticeable and they want you to laugh along with them as the lines are delivered! My wife turned to me and exclaimed when the credits were rolling, ""We'll be adding this one to our collection!"" That just about sums it up!"
23,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,16 October 2005,Brits have the 'wit'!,"Imaginative, quick-paced, satirical! Americans do 'zany', but the Brits do 'witty' -- and they love to poke fun at themselves (ahem: unattractive teeth, large lips/nose, 'veddy' common or 'veddy' snobby, obsession with the 'gahden'). Inside jokes for the older folk in the audience, lots of action for the kiddies. Subtle use of devices from other classic films (watch for 'Back to the Future', 'Indiana Jones..', 'Harvey', 'Tremors'.. and more). Also, a nifty 'buddy' film (Gromit is a quiet, but resourceful sidekick). Add brilliant voice work by Bonham-Carter and Fiennes (is it true? the best acting these days is being done in animation?) - enjoy! I saw it with the grandkids. fun time for all. - canuckteach"
24,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,16 April 2006,"Amusing, Inventive, Colorful & Predictable","This was very good, except for two things which I'll mention at the end. The animation is great, highlighted by Nick Park and company's trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters, which make you laugh almost every time you see someone. The color was magnificent, too.The best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven throughout. This is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many viewings to catch all the gags. It's just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball ""Wallace"" and his silent-and-smart dog ""Gromit."" Along the way, it pokes fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens, something akin to how the obsessive dog lovers were pictured in ""Best Of Show.""My only complaints were two typical traits of today's films, animated or not: 1 - let's make the cleric in the film look like a total idiot; 2 - let's overdo the final action scene with the predictable result but way overdone. Those aside, this is still a very amusing film that should provide a lot of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy multiple times."
25,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,22 October 2005,Awesome!,"Everyone waited for the movie, and when it comes out, and now it has. Yay Wallace and Grommit! It looks...weird. But it's not. It's really funny! My friends and me went. We thought we were going too come out of the theater wishing we had seen ""The Fog"". But that's not it at all. We want too see it again!I honestly can't remember the last time I had a good time with my friends! Lol we were loving' the ""May Contain Nuts"" part, and the airplane part.Totally see it! It's better then the trailers look, ya know?10/10"
26,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,12 February 2007,"""Oh ho ho, cracking job!""","After searching for cheese on the moon, being troubled by a penguin thief and blamed for rustling sheep, Wallace makes his debut on the big screen. This time, the British duo run Anti-Pesto, guardians of vegetable patches from the terrible creatures of the night who would disturb gardens. Coming off the heels of their successful Chicken Run, Aardman Studios returned to what originally made director Nick Park a star in the UK: Wallace is an inventor who loves cheese and whose mind is on the moon, while his silent partner is a dog named Gromit, gifted with common sense. Done entirely in claymation, the series has been awarded several nods for fluidity of motion and excellent comedy. Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit continues Aardman Studios' track record of excellence, in the Oscar-winner for Best Animated Film of 2005. It is well deserving.The antics are familiar territory for Wallace & Gromit, with Wallace's wondrous yet inane inventions that cause all sorts of trouble, while Gromit is stuck with solving all the pieces of the puzzle. When a mysterious giant creature begins rampaging the gardens Anti-Pesto is sworn to protect, Wallace finds himself along for the ride, with Gromit playing detective. The silent interplay between Gromit and other creatures in the film are the highlights, while Wallace provides most of the action sequences, including one spectacularly choreographed chase scene. The animation work is without a rival in this field, and it's a shame to have learned that the props studio burned down shortly after completion of the film. Stars Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club, Big Fish) and Ralph Fiennes (The Constant Gardener) lend their voices as Wallace's very-English (see: beautiful teeth) love interest and the shotgun-totting man competing for her hand. All in all, the voice acting has a British charm vital for the comedy of the film, though it is perhaps Gromit's lack of voice that offers the most laughs.Pixar Animations is noted for creating family films that offer laughs for viewers both young and old; despite years of attempting to renew their success with Shrek, DreamWorks Animation has yet to produce a film on the same level as their competition, but having procured the rights for this film accomplishes such a goal  even though all the credit must be given to Aardman Studios. Wallace and Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit succeeds in being a worthy fourth edition in the series, though those who have not seen the three short films will have no trouble jumping on the bandwagon with this film. Unfortunately a poor marketing campaign and the lack of computer-generated animation likely means many gave this film a pass; this is unfortunate being that it is the most fun family film of 2005, filled with quirky humour, action and cute rabbits. One of Wallace's famous lines best sums up my feelings to the film's creators: ""Oh ho ho, cracking job!"" (9/10 Excellent)"
27,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,3 February 2007,Gromit is one of the most expressionate expressionless actors ever,"I went in to watch the new Wallace & Gromit movie with a little bit of bias. Wallace & Gromit: The Wrong Trousers happens to be one of my favorite short animation pieces and although just because it's a Wallace & Gromit film, doesn't mean that I'll love it, I went in expecting to be charmed.And I was.The film was true Wallace & Gromit in form and fashion, this time featuring Wallace & Gromit as humane pest control operatives ""Anti-Pesto."" Again, featuring many cute Rube-Goldberg-type inventions, cheese, and menacing, but somewhat silly, villains, the film is full of things to adore.There were a couple moments that threw me off, namely a couple of jokes that belong in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, but I suppose it will fly over the heads of the target youth audience. Actually, I haven't seen a General Audiences rated movie this enjoyable in a while, and minus those moments, this film is good clean fun.Wallace & Gromit's sense of humor is less the laugh-out-loud humor but more the grin-inducing chuckle-laden charming type, with some punny moments, and it works to great effect. In particular, Gromit is perhaps the best silent character in recent film history. Without saying nary a word or making a single sound, he manages to convey a great deal of emotion and comic excellence, which is quite impressive considering that Gromit is made entirely of clay.The plot is simple and not particularly original, but I was surprised by the inventiveness by which Nick Park and company took a few old stories and refreshed them. I really can find no solid wrong with the film minus those unexpected moments of adult humor.Highly recommended. 8/10."
28,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,31 December 2005,Aardman just keep on getting better and better..,"Aardman have been around a considerable time now, yet they haven't gone the route of most companies, namely that of getting too big for their own boots. Instead, Aardman continue to pursue their classic heroes, Wallace & Gromitt, and give them continuing adventures. I suppose it's simply a matter of ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" at work.In fact, Aardman continue to polish and refine the ""claymation"" process they use for most of their work. Were-Rabbit is the latest example of their work and quite possible their best work (though Chicken Run is still up there).If there is any problem with their work it's often that there is so much to look at that you cannot possibly take it all in at the first viewing. The action (and gags) come so fast that it is easy to miss things. Of course, this just ensures the longevity of the film and the certainty that DVD's will be bought when available.There are a lot of nice touches - the scene with the two dogs and the van door had me rolling about - and the gags vary from verbal to visual with a lot of casual ""name"" plays on items and equipment. Too many to take in, as I said.If you are a fan of animation comedy of any sort, then W&G:Curse of the Were-Rabbit is for you."
29,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,22 December 2005,I _do_ love a bit of brilliant animation...,"Just returned from taking the family to see this movie. Absolutely beautiful. Packed with action, laughs, references to previous W&G's, etc. The kids were commenting while we were still in the movie what a great movie it was. It's a true return to the original heart and soul of Wallace and Gromit, with a sense that they've only gotten better at it in the intervening time.The fact that you can see the fingerprints on the characters, the beautifully expressive faces, the visual puns (they really outdid themselves in that department this time)--it just doesn't miss a beat from beginning to end.Characters like Wallace and Gromit really earn a place in peoples' hearts, and it's always a bit nerve-wracking for me wondering whether the new material that is produced will live up to the extremely high hopes I (and, surely, thousands or millions of others) have for the characters that we feel such a connection to.Thanks to Aardman for caring enough to put out another one that lives up to what seems to me the impossibly high standard they've set for themselves."
30,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,11 December 2005,A Nutshell Review: Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,"In one word: Excellent! I'm a sucker for stop-motion animation, and this movie takes the cake. For the uninitiated, Wallace & Gromit tells the tale of a wacky inventor and his faithful dog, who is a highly intelligent mutt that can walk on his hind legs and operate various contraptions.In the Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Wallace & Gromit protect the town's annual vegetable growing contest by ridding the town's rabbit problem (oh, so cute, you wanna give them a carrot to chew on). However, their humane techniques of capturing these critters, especially the loads from Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter, straight from another stop motion pic The Corpse Bride), led them to a storage problem.Wallace comes up with a hare-brained (pardon the pun) idea of brainwashing the rabbits into becoming non-vegetarians led to a mysterious appearance of a king-sized rabbit haunting the populace, and it's up to our favourite man-dog team to return things back to normal, while fending off the competition from a certain Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes), a poke at a certain Alan Quartermaine.While the storyline's pretty straightforward, and the mystery of the Were-Rabbit would've been a non-event for most moviegoers, what makes this movie enjoyable is the intricate details of the plasticine used in making the characters and town come alive. What works is not pretending to tell a very intelligent story, but one that is simple, accessible and therefore, entertaining. And THE character that steals the show is Gromit, given quite a bit of screen time and involved in pretty much all the action sequences. Kudos too to the filmmakers for refusing to budge to recast the voice of Wallace.You must watch this, and I'd give it thumbs up as the animation of the year contender! P.S. attached to this picture is a short clip from the Penguins of Madagascar. I thought it was pretty hilarious too, and those dudes certainly deserve a picture of their own."
31,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,2 November 2005,A must see for all animation lovers!,"A wonderful and colourful animation that gripped the nation...the duo strikes back! Wallace and Gromit is an enjoyable, family film, and is a must see for animation lovers everywhere and for everyone who has watched and enjoyed the first three films. It is the daddy of animation with more heat and adventure. Filled with more humour and laughter, this film delivers outstanding workmanship with such greater specific detail to each character. With much more controlled effects and models, it really brought to life the characters of Wallace and Gromit, while still keeping the original look of the previous films. With an outstanding and bubbly storyline, it captured the nations hearts and is well worth watching."
32,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,31 October 2005,What a GRAND movie!,"We (two mature adults) saw Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit yesterday. All the other adults in the theater had at least one kid in tow. Most of these kids began laughing early on, but it was the ADULTS who were in stitches most often! It is just amazing to watch the action and try to remember that the ""actors"" are plasticine. Gromet gets the vote for ""Best Movie Dog"" ever. Be sure to listen and watch carefully...there are numerous jokes and sight gags popping up in the dialog and the background. We especially hooted at the label on the old cardboard box Wallace is forced to don late in film. We are huge Nick Parks' fans, and this movie just augmented our deep affection for his work. Go see Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit ASAP. Four adult thumbs HIGH up!"
33,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,26 October 2005,An amazing venture into the feature film world!!!!,"What a wonderful film. I was concerned that W&G were better suited to the 30 minute shorts they were originally restricted to, mainly by time to produce constraints. That is exactly what was the case, RESTRICTED to the shorts because in the 80+ minutes this lasts, you are taken on a meticulously constructed, lovingly created tail!!(sic) The film is scary for very young 'uns but more than funny enough for older kids and actually even funnier for adults with a mound of in-jokes and little snippets of one-liners and observational comedy that you may only pick up everything in the film after a few viewings. Superb and well worth the wait, I have been following the progress of this since Chicken Run (2000) and was not disappointed. I would say bring on the sequel but that might be selfish as the sequel would have to be VERY special to just sit alongside this masterpiece. Well done aardman and dreamworks! Thankyou."
34,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,26 October 2005,Wallace and Gromit's Grandest Day Out,"Aardman Animation Studio's ""Wallace & Gromit"" feature, ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" was five years in the making. Now that it's finally here, everyone who sees it will agree, it was well worth the wait! The beloved duo is back again: Wallace, the flaky cheese-loving inventor, and his brilliant dog Gromit, have a new business. They run a humane service to rid gardens of pests. But Wallace's attempts at scientific rehab of rabbits causes him to create a monster. The movie shows the charm and humor we've come to expect from Nick Park. There are lots of sight gags to keep the eyes busy. The humor appeals to all ages (although a few Benny Hill-type gags are more for adults). In the end, it's another triumph for Nick Park and his creations."
35,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,24 October 2005,Almost everything we could have hoped for,"With so much computer animation around today, Nick Park and his clay figure movers at Aardman were bound to find it difficult to prove themselves in the cinematic world. Nevertheless they managed it five years ago with Chicken Run - a great escape inspired romp that, while entertaining, seemed just a bit too bland and mainstream. And it lacked something.Or should I say some THINGS? Two things, in fact. Two characters. Yes, after five years in the making, Aardman have finally brought the names that truly put them on the map, Wallace & Gromit, and placed them in a cinema near you. And the result is everything you could hope for. Well, almost everything...the plot isn't particularly strong or unique (you will be reminded of King Kong, An American Werewolf In London and The Hulk, among others). Additionally, the humour doesn't seem to be quite as cutting edge as it was in the Wallace and Gromit short films. But the film does keep you completely involved from beginning to end, with the extended running time passing rather quickly. So yes, it can be said that the transition from small screen to big one has been a success, despite those aforementioned minor complaints.Anyway... (minor spoiler warning in the next paragraph) Our heroes now run a critter-trapping business, Anti-Pesto. Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis, as always) and Gromit have the unenviable job of keeping rabbits away from their owner's vegetables. With a vegetable competition in the town soon, business is blooming. It'll bloom even more now that Lady Tottington (an unrecognisable Helena Bonham Carter) has a rabbit problem that even Wallace and Gromit seem incapable of dealing with. But they do, much to chagrin of Tottington's fiancée Lord Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes in full on snide and ruthless mode) who believes killing them is the best solution. (Reminds you of at least one of Fiennes' characters, doesn't it?) However Wallace has come up with an ingenious invention that will stop the rabbits thinking about eating any vegetables. Some kind of mind manipulation machine, as he puts it. Great idea, sure, but a minor mistake results in the creation of the dreaded Were-Rabbit. Cue trouble.What the film lacks in thematic depth it makes up for in good all round entertainment value. Chicken Run showed us that claymation could be visually astounding, but The Curse Of The Were Rabbit is even more impressive to look at. Not that you get much of a chance when the plot picks up the pace, however. For the shorts had the amazing ability to create tense sequences and mix them with fascinating scenes & fine jokes, some more subtle than others. You want those? Well, you've got them. There's even elements of pathos and romance (just like there were in The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave) and wisely, the filmmakers do not overplay them. Any audience members who haven't seen the shorts stand a very good chance of being won over by what they see here.I really do think that The Curse Of The Were Rabbit, or any Wallace & Gromit short for that matter, is impossible to dislike in the slightest. If this isn't a huge hit already, it will be, and deservedly so.Rating: 8/10"
36,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,24 October 2005,"Funniest film of the year, what a treat!","I can't really add to what has been said before, superb animation, great plot, nice suspense, wonderful modelling etc. etc.However I couldn't understand why anyone would give this film a 1 rating. So I read through the comments. I really don't understand how you cannot make jokes about religion in a film, how you can believe some of the jokes in COTWR are too sexy for a U film, or how on earth you can take a 4 year old to a cinema and then blame the film because the 4 year old is badly behaved!In the cinema I was in the audience was noisy during the ads, bludgeoned into silence for the Penguin short and then noisy again during the changeover. During the 85 minutes of COTWR the only sounds from the audience, which was about 2/3rds kids, was laughter, giggles and enjoyment. Ignore the moaners - GO AND SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!"
37,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,21 October 2005,Ey-Up....I laughed till I stopped.,"Nick Park has become something of a British institution - as well as appearing to be a very nice chap. I went to see The Curse of the Were-Rabbit with some trepidation...wondering whether Wallace & Gromit would be able to hold an audiences interest for an hour and a half. I needn't have worried. The film was great from start to finish. It's rare to go to the cinema and hear an audience laughing out loud throughout. It was also good that there were many laughs specifically for adults that smaller children would miss. When you consider the claymation process used then I would go so far to say that this film amounts to a masterpiece of cinema. There isn't a fault that I can think of. The script is great and the cinematography is great - it's easy to forget that you're watching something that's been animated. I'm also extremely pleased that the film retains it's britishness without the need to either apologise for it or have a token American in it to gain credibility over the Atlantic. Just a note to those other brits (presumably southerners) who have assumed that because it's set in the north of England - then it must be Yorkshire. It is quite obviously set east of the Pennines in Lancashire. Nick Park was raised in Preston, Wallace has a Lancashire accent and likes Lancashire hotpot! Go and see it...you won't regret it!"
38,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,24 October 2005,Good old Wallace and Gromit are back again,"A very solid and enjoyable feature film for the British pair. I do think that the feature format is a bit too long for this type of film - I could feel some slight struggles in terms of holding the audience's attention, and do we really need a five-minute long session with the vicar? But when all is said and done, this is Wallace and Gromit, and every frame is filled with care and attention to detail - a joy to watch, and such a relief that Jeff Katzenberg hasn't tweaked our lovable British pair out of all recognition - he has understood that the humour needs to stem from the Britishness of it all. Gromit provides the most comedy, as usual, but the story of the rabbits works fairly well, although just how far can they stretch the Wallace-as-an-inventor element - particularly with the ridiculous ""brain-altering"" invention. But these weaknesses can be easily forgiven as we settle back and let the familiar theme wash over us as we enjoy the well-thumbed Plasticine master and his dog - preferably with a nice hot cup of tea and some Wendsleydale cheese on a Jacobs cream cracker. Ahhhh."
39,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,21 October 2005,My second favorite animated movie,"This is one of the best movies ever made. It's funny, fresh, creative, and above all Wallace and Grommit. I'm not a humungous fan of animated films but every once in a while a good one comes along. (eg. The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Shrek, Corpse Bride.) My favorite animated movie ever would have to be Alladin. Nothing will ever top that. But Wallace and Grommit: The Curse of the Wererabbit comes close. I'd have to say that Quartermaine was probably one of the most annoying characters ever (which is sad because Ralph Fiennes is usually fantastic a.k.a. Schindler's List) but he does little to take away from this gem in the pile of sand that is film making today. Go to see this movie it's one of the best ever. There are some underlying adult themes but they will fly right past children who deffenately should be brought to see this movie. The funniest thing in this movie is probably Hutch the Rabbit. Go and see this it isn't a wasted $5.25"
40,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,10 October 2005,Pure Unadulterated Fun,"As a fan of Wallace and Gromit's (mis)adventures for many years I was eager to see the latest effort by Aardman Animation. Suffice to say I was not disappointed. This movie is a testament to what incredibly talented people can do with an old fashioned medium such as clay. Though I am a huge fan of Pixar's films, there is just no comparison with the ""real"" thing.But if you think the quality of the animation is the main reason I gave this film a 10 you would be wrong. It earned such high marks because it's quite simply the most fun I've had at a movie in years. The film is loaded with humor, both subtle and slapstick, fantastic and lovable characters, and some of the best action sequences you will ever see on film (John Woo, eat your heart out), all in a family friendly G-rated wrapper.You may read in some reviews that the movie contains sexual innuendo that strays from the W&G formula, but I can't imagine anyone being even mildly offended. I found the jokes and sight gags quite funny and the facial expressions of all the characters (especially Gromit) are by themselves worth the price of admission. I advise you to pay close attention to everything in this movie, because there are hidden jokes in just about every scene. The attention to detail Nick Park and Co. pay to every frame is mind boggling.The bottom line here is that this is a must see film for everyone, young and old alike. I guarantee if you're not already a fan of W&G, you will be!I would be negligent if I didn't mention the excellent cartoon short that is shown before W&G. It features the wise cracking penguins from the movie ""Madagascar"". I have not seen ""Madagascar"" but those penguins alone are cause for buying the DVD when it is released."
41,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,31 January 2006,The best animated film I've seen!,"The Curse of The Were Rabbit makes history in the world of animation. Sparkling with wit and humour, it really is quality family entertainment. Wallace and Gromit return as the lovable duo; Gromit; who never says anything, and Wallace; who talks enough for the both of them. This time the pair are on top form as Anti-Pesto, a pest control company on the case of the Were Rabbit, a mythical beast savaging everyone's prize vegetables just before the Annual Giant Vegetable Competition at Tottington Hall. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to catch the beast and save the day, but there's a twist to the tale... I have to say that this film exceeded my expectations in every respect. I cannot fault it, it was everything a family film should be. With tremendous attention to detail, subtle humour and a cracking plot, Nick Parker has once again hit the nail on the head. I heard that several years were spent making this film. Not a second wasted!"
42,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,21 September 2005,A cracking good adventure!,"Bring on the Wensleydale, because the cheese devouring Wallace and long suffering Gromit are back for another cracking good time in Wallace & Gromit : Curse of the Were-Rabbit.For the uninitiated, Wallace & Gromit first starred in a trio of short animations - A Grand Day Out, The Wrong Trousers, and A Close Shave. They've also been in a collection of very short sequences (Cracking Contraptions - the DVD of which is now a collectors item and rather expensive) - and a TV advert (for the curiously named Kangoo car - not made in Australia). Wallace (voiced by esteemed veteran actor Peter Sallis) is an ingenious, albeit rather unlucky, inventor for whom nothing ever seems to quite go right. Gromit is his far more clever, ever loyal, and completely silent, dog. Together they have ventured to the moon for cheese, captured a dastardly penguin diamond thief, and saved a herd of sheep from being converted into dogfood.With their new and apparently highly successful business venture, Wallace and Gromit are garden saving superheroes of northern England. With Lady Tottingham's grand vegetable contest coming up, the two are much in demand. Woken in the dark of night by their security net of electronic garden gnomes, our dynamic duo rush off - in a brilliant sequence that pays homage to the old Thunderbirds puppets of old - to capture ravaging bunnies before they can destroy the vegetable aspirations of the contestants. Is your huge pumpkin being accosted by a fluffy bunny? No problem - call in Anti-Pesto for humane pest control!The fabulous appearance of the Bunny Vac 6000, and the mass suctioning of ravaging rabbits from Lady Tottingham's lawns must be seen to be believed. Yet that could be said for much of the film which abounds with fantastic machinery, incredible cuteness, and a flair all too often missing from movies.But this accumulation of bunnies incarcerated by Anti-Pesto soon becomes a problem, and Wallace seeks a technological solution to their ever hungry veggie-destroying appetites. In doing so, however, Wallace unwittingly creates the were-rabbit!Yes, that's right - a bunny that's ten feet tall with a voracious appetite for the weak, innocent veggies of the contestants.Now, Wallace and Gromit must save not only the vegetables from the were-rabbit, but also Lady Tottingham (Helena Bonham-Carter) and her fortunes from the machinations of the despicable (and bunny-hunting!) Victor Quartermaine (voiced by Ralph Fiennes).In these days of computer generated shonkery the likes of Aardman studios are a distinctly endangered species. Eschewing the superficial glitz of silicon everything in Curse of the Were-Rabbit is finely crafted by hand. Well, almost everything - one explosion and some aetheric electrical effects being the exceptions. This breathes such a life into the characters that they are that much more real, and the bunnies that much more cute, because of it.The enormous care and attention to detail for which Aardman are well renowned are also ever present. Small, hilarious, touches abound throughout the movie. A great deal of asides, backgrounds, and peripheral objects are filled with homage, humour, or outright absurdity. You'd have to be paying real attention to catch them all first time through. But unlike some movies (yes, I'm looking at you, Shark Tale, and you Shrek) Curse of the Were-Rabbit doesn't rely upon those touches. They merely add to what is already an engrossing, hugely funny, and frankly delightfully charming movie.From start to finish the story moves along at a cracking pace, with never a stutter. From the opening race to capture the bunny intent on destroying a giant pumpkin, through Gromit's van drive into the were-rabbit's burrows, and the ultimate confrontation with Quatermaine, the action sequences deliver thrills and laughs.If pressed, I would note two very minor flaws. Firstly, putting Gromit back inside an aeroplane for the finale feels almost like revisiting A Close Shave, though fortunately the nature of the chase (and the 'plane itself) do much to ward off deja-vu. Secondly, the identity of the were-rabbit is obvious (and in fact rather spoiled by some of the trailers around on the internet).But truly, these are very minor quibbles amongst what is a stellar addition to the Wallace & Gromit series. The characters are endearing, charming - yes, the bunnies are insufferably cute - and for all some of them are perhaps two dimensional they are no less for it.If you have children, take them all to see Curse of the Were-Rabbit. If you don't, then go anyway. You'll have a cracking good time.I'll stake my gorgonzola on it!9.0/10"

44,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,19 October 2005,Claymation and Plastecine Amazement! (But what the heck was up with the CGI Penguin short?),"If after watching Wallace and Gromit's first feature-length film, you find yourself with a hankering to try new cheeses or run back into the theater and watch it again, no one will blame you. This is a wonderful movie featuring a cheese-loving kid-at-heart character, and the claymation creates a warmth and connection not found in most CGI productions. Although there are Hollywood influences that snag the story here and there, Nick Park's much-loved creations of the wild inventor and his endlessly patient dog stay true to their small-town selves; even while he improves on the visual complexity of stop-motion animation.As the operators of ""The Anti-Pesto Squad"", the intrepid pair of heroes secures the safety of the town's prize vegetable patches from the numerous hungry rabbits out to satisfy their cravings for a midnight snack. The annual Giant Vegetable-Growing Contest is approaching, and there is nothing more important to the townsfolk and to the hostess of the contest, Lady Campanula Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter). Arriving at Tottington Manor to deal with a prolific rabbit infestation, Wallace (Peter Sallis), attracts the ire of hunter, Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes), by accidentally interrupting his unwanted attempts at courtship. Having corralled more rabbits than they know what to do with, the always-silent Gromit assists Wallace in an experiment to remove the vegetable-eating impulses from the captured rabbits, so they could be safely released (and so Wallace can impress the peaceable Lady Tottington). Although the experiment works on the normal rabbits, a large vegetable-eating predator begins to menace the town gardens. Wallace and Gromit must rely on each other to solve the mystery, keep Quartermaine at bay, satisfy the townsfolk and ensure the safety of the Giant Vegetable Contest.The only things that weigh down the fun are a few misplaced scenes. The previous ""Wallace and Gromit"" adventures had villains, but none so aggressive as Quartermaine. Silly though he is, a hunter character brings in the element of a gun. A single gun even in a children's movie these days is hardly a shocking element, but it feels out of place in this quiet little English hamlet. It certainly clashes with the spirit of invention and the previous short films' Keaton and Chaplin-inspired resolutions. The one scene that truly appears to be drawn from the Hollywood action handbook is the faceoff that occurs when Quartermaine corners Wallace in the woods. It simply felt excessive to give the quiet Wallace an action-hero turn, no matter how the mechanics of the story might make it plausible. Only Gromit's finely-tuned reactions lend enough subtle humor to prevent the spell of fun from being broken.Despite these few misgivings, the whole clay parade is well worth the excursion to the theater for all ages. The characters are warmer and more familiar than most recent animations, even those as successful as the ""Shrek"" series. Everything is done so well, that these characters take on tangible humanity. When dozens of the Plasticine characters dart about the screen in amazing fluidity, try to fathom the fact that they were all coordinated one motion for each character, one at a time, for 24 frames of every visual second. Each camera movement is artfully and carefully executed. There is so much spectacle and gentle humor created in the molded environment, that it is impossible to leave the theater without your spirits being lifted. (And just perhaps a newfound appreciation for cheese and vegetables.) 8 out of 10*********************** ""A Christmas Caper"" (This title does not have its own listing on IMDb.com, so it seems best to leave a mini-review here.) Disappointing and Out-of-Season Schtick Matched with ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is a CGI animated short, ""A Christmas Caper"" staring the Penguins of this summer's ""Madagascar"". This is about a group of four militant penguins who live in the Bronx Zoo. It's Christmas Eve, and the youngest penguin, Private (Christopher Knights), feels bad for the zoo's resident polar bear who is alone. Private sets out to find him a present. When the rest of the group realizes that Private has gone missing, they set out to bring him back. Ultimately, they must rescue their junior member from an elderly Manhattan resident and her bloodthirsty miniature poodle.There were moments of humor, but no tone seemed to hold the entire production together. The scene on the street with the souvenir vendor was easily the funniest. There the penguins ""blend in"" with a group of nuns and inexplicably regurgitate dynamite. However, the whole affair felt misplaced as a prelude to the kind of story to be told in ""Wallace and Gromit"". Although the computer animation is eye-poppingly good, the penguins move frenetically and spend most of their time shouting at each other. It will probably satisfy any 5-year-old on a sugar rush, but wild behavior by itself simply doesn't amount to humor.The story resolves with a nod to friendship over presents, but it seems less genuine when the entire cast of ""Madagascar"" characters is suddenly there to sing a goodbye song. How coincidental that the DVD release happens to be only a month away. The Christmas theme also seems aimed to prime kids for the shopping season. Aside from the fact that penguins fit well in snow and ice, couldn't this have been set during some other time of year, perhaps say, Halloween?If you're late for ""Wallace and Gromit"", don't sweat it. This will pad the start time, so you can grab a snack for the real show.3 out of 10 for ""A Christmas Caper""8 out of 10 for ""Wallace and Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit"""
45,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,19 October 2005,"Pleasant, but not as good as Chicken Run","The clay-mation is great in this film but the colors are not as bright and dramatic as they were in Chicken Run, filmmaker Parks' earlier blockbuster hit. I liked it, but was not blown away as I was by CR, as the rabbit pest control storyline was not as interesting to me as penned-up chickens ingeniously escaping their pen and the axe via a homemade airplane. CR had a lot more goofy characters imparting their various British accents, personalities and antics into the film than did W&G, and that made for a better story.This film's outrageous Rube Goldberg-ian invention devices were just as clever, the characters were nearly as lovable, the cad was not as detestable and threatening as those in CR, and the story lacked much of the zany zest of CR thus it fell short of Chicken Run's brilliance, though a good overall effort and a pleasure to see.As a kid who loved the old Viewmasters and their fairy tale film discs, I was and always will be a sucker for the comic ""art"" of clay-mation. I hope we never let it die, and these two films by Parks and any others he makes in the future should keep it going for a long time. My hat is off, well off, to him."
46,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,8 October 2005,Fantastic movie; I loved it.,"After having loved the Wallace and Gromit shorts and Chicken Run, it was great to finally see a feature length Wallace and Gromit movie. It didn't disappoint in the least, and turned out to be the best time I've had at the theater in a long while. The humor is light, clever and understated, and fast-paced enough to never drag. The lines spoken by the (surprisingly big) cast of characters are absurd and hilarious (if you don't laugh at a little rabbit saying ""Awww, the bounce has gone out of his bungee"" in a British accent, something's wrong with you).It was interesting to see the movie preceded by an incredibly obnoxious short featuring the penguins from ""Madagascar."" I can only assume it was included to show the difference in quality between American and British humor (American humor: penguins drinking egg nog through a beer bong while shouting ""Chug! chug! chug!""). Just when I thought those stupid ADHD penguins were never going to go away, the screen mercifully faded and the charming W&G music started up. It's good to see they haven't changed at all since we last saw them, although they get in a quite a bit more trouble this time around. Wallace takes his experiments a bit too far when an innocent attempt to brainwash rabbits creates a monster, setting the stage for a great sendup on old sci-fi and horror films. Wallace, as usual, has no idea what's going on, leaving Gromit to try and rectify things by himself (the scene where he chases the Were-Rabbit through the streets is the funniest scene by far).Gromit in particular is one of my favorite animated characters. He's the best pantomime character since Harpo Marx. He never makes a sound (doesn't even have a mouth, in fact), but shows loads of personality through his eyes and movements alone. I love how he's never disturbed by Wallace's horrible creations, just sort of exasperated. He's alert to the point of paranoia, and is always ready to set things right, whether it be bank-robbing mechanical pants or a killer rabbit.It's a great movie, with a wild plot and cast of characters, that all ages will enjoy. I loved it, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Now let's just hope there's a sequel."
47,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,4,18 October 2005,what a waste,"Wallace and Gromit-Curse of the Were-Rabbit, what can i say, the voice overs are good, peter sallis does an excellent job as always, as does ralph fiennes and helena bonham carter, ever peter kay did a fine job and i cant fault the claymation, as for the plot, i felt it was kinda thin and unoriginal, it didn't feel like they writers had put a lot of effort into this and had just decided to rip off other films instead of trying to make an original, not up to the standards of previous Wallace and Gromit outing such as ""The Wrong Trousers"" and ""A Close Shave"" there were some funny moment but not enough to keep me interested and even if your not a film fan you wont be able to miss the blatantly obvious King Kong reference, if you haven't already seen this i would give this one a miss, and spend your 5 pounds on something more interesting, like a pot of paint so you can watch it dry."
48,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,23 October 2005,Delightfully British animation despite maybe testing the patience of those raised on the rapid fire Pixar animations,"Wallace and Gromit have spotted a niche in the market so, in a vegetable-mad village, they now run Anti-Pesto, a humane pest control company. Using all manner of high tech devices, they capture the rabbits and keep them in pens in their basement. With storage problems building up and a new client requiring a great number of rabbits cleared from her property, Wallace tries a brain-washing device that he hopes will rob the rabbits of their vegetable cravings. It goes wrong of course and neither Wallace nor Gromit think any more of it until, that is, the village suddenly faces a larger, faster rabbit that threatens to destroy the whole vegetable contest.I think the thing that is most pleasing about this film is just how very British it is; W&G may have hit the big screen but they have certainly not gone Hollywood or lost any of the quaint charm that made them famous as they became as much a Christmas institution as the Queen's Speech (which they followed for several years). So here we have a typically silly little plot around the village adventures of the pair and it manages to be consistently charming and enjoyable. The story is strong and does not need long noises to constantly stimulate  instead it is just a good yarn. Meanwhile the animation is impressive, again providing a real warm feel to it and giving a feeling of depth and atmosphere that the CGI cartoons just don't muster. The jokes are not aimed at children nor at adults (although there are a few that are specifically targeted at those sectors) but rather the majority of it is just a good family film with stuff that everyone will laugh at, rather than having to do physical pratfalls for the kids and lots of cynical adult jokes for the adults to get.To me this is a strength but to some it will mean that there isn't going to be a big belly laugh every 30 seconds and the fact that some of the kids started getting shiftless was testimony to that. I personally don't think this is the films problem so much as it is the problem of kids who need bright moving objects to constantly stimulate them but it is something that adults should bare in mind. Likewise adults used to constantly laughing at snide adult gags in cartoons might be disappointed to find that there are only a couple (although they are marvellously British). This is best seen in the movie references  in some pixar films they come thick and fast and are a means to an end; in W&G they are there but are used to compliment the plot rather than for a quick laugh. However like I said, I didn't find these to be problems and I actually preferred the fact that effects, gags and pratfalls had not been placed before a good solid story. The animation matches this professional, careful approach and it has a real good feel to it with the atmosphere of the werewolf movies and village horror.The cast are great although it is to the animators' credit that the most enjoyable character works entirely on expression: Gromit is as good as ever. Sallis is great fun as Wallis and has remained the fun character we have grown to love. The support cast is very good with good turns from Fiennes, Carter, Kay, Smith, Thomson and others all providing good voice work while still knowing that Wallace & Gromit are the stars and not to try and overshadow them.Overall a very enjoyable family film. Viewers used to the quickfire laughs, adult material and hi-tech animation of Pixar will maybe find that they and their kids get a bit bored by it at times but the majority of viewers will find this to be a lovingly crafted story that sacrifices some of the highs in return for consistent quality from start to finish."
49,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,20 October 2005,Sheer Delightful Joy for Children and Adults on Their Own,"""Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is sheer delightful joy! From beginning to end the enjoyment doesn't stop, from belly laughs to chuckles or just plain constant grins. While there are gleeful references to ""King Kong,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""The Muppet Show"" and Beatrix Potter and other horror and sci fi classics, these are much more in tribute than the usual stitched-together dependence on popular culture knowing winks that passes for two-level humor for both adults and kids in most animated films. But there is no talking down to kids, similar to ""Sleepy Hollow,"" while adults can attend for fun on their own. There are adult puns and leering visual jokes, particularly using melons, there are far fewer than in most contemporary animated features. An interviewer on BBC America thought the humor would be ""too British"" for Americans, but even with some difference in terms I was too busy laughing to notice. Certainly all the accents are comprehensible.The plot resolution didn't make 100% sense but it was all so good-natured it didn't matter.While I haven't seen the preceding Wallace and Gromit shorts to know if directors Steve Box and Nick Park have further developed their stop animation technique, the action and detail were marvelous. Helena Bonham Carter's voice over work was even better than in ""Corpse Bride."" Ralph Fiennes's voice was unrecognizable as he created a whole new character. Stay through the credits, where every employee of Aardman studios and their newborn babies are thanked, for the floating rabbits and the funny disclaimer.Way too early for Christmas, the film was preceded by a holiday short featuring the penguins from ""Madagascar."" Mostly funny, it played on many more stereotypes than Wallace and Gromit did."
50,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,19 October 2005,Great Fun For All,"Went to see this with my lil sister having already watched the 3 other short movies, the aardman classics and just about every other thing that Nick Park has produced, and again he did not fail to impress. The characters are so well put together, there actions say more than their words especially in Gromits case.Now the plot about the whole were-rabbit was entertaining and the twist was at first well hidden and Ralph Fiennes voices his character so well, he always sounded full of evil and malice, which was perfect for his part. Mrs Carter also voiced her part very well, being the posh woman in distress which she pulled off with imperative ease. Wallace, well you don't really need to say he was voiced well all you have to do is look at the other 3 shorts.But overall it was a great film, well put together, perfect for kids and there was adult jokes in their aw swell. But even without the adult jokes this film was still made for every single member of the British Isles. If you didn't like this then you watched the wrong film."
51,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,16 October 2005,Fun for all the family,"The UK critics have blessed this film with the sort of praise that is rarely given to Hollywood movies. I have a feeling this may be a rare show of patriotism by the media, but the film is worthy of the plaudits.The film uses the stop go animation technique as opposed to the cgi techniques used in most animation films these days. It is obviously a very painstaking task since the movie spent several years in production.The villagers are haunted by a huge rabbit who is feasting on the vegetables in the run up to the annual vegetable competition. Wallace and Gromit are brought in to trace the culprit, but it may be harder to find than they imagine. Both adults and kids will find humour in the film and the 80 minutes fairly zip along. Must have a chance of the animation Oscar next year."
52,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,15 October 2005,"Finally, a W&G full length film!","Wallace and Gromit operate a humane pest-control outfit, 'Anti-Pesto' and with only days to go before the annual Giant Vegetable Competition, business is booming. But Wallace & Gromit are finding out that running a 'humane' pest control outfit has its drawbacks as their West Wallaby Street home fills to the brim with captive rabbits. Suddenly, a huge mysterious veg-ravaging 'beast' begins attacking the town's sacred vegetable plots at night, and the competition hostess, Lady Tottington, commissions Anti-Pesto to catch it and save the day.It was great to see Wallace & Gromit in a full length movie and as usual, the characters were fantastic, interesting and funny. The plot was simple enough to ensure that children could understand and maintain interest. There were also some cleaver links to previous W&G adventures and some subtle jokes for adults."
53,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,15 October 2005,Inspired,"This film though very English/British in its nature should appeal to everyone - where ever they reside. This has to be the best film so far this year and it had me rolling in the aisles. It's the little things you have to look for i.e. the jar of 'middle aged spread', the 'Hello' type magazine entitled 'Aye Up' and the Latin name for the Loch Ness monster 'Touristus Trappus' (I think) and there's probably loads that I missed. The star definitely has to be Gromit - though they only have eyes and a nose to work with you know instantly what his feelings are - whether it be sad, happy or just plain exasperated with Wallace. This film is a rare treat - one that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. Superb!!"
54,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,10 October 2005,A great and lovely movie!,"Firstly at all, I want to tell I haven't seen the shorts about Wallace and Gromit made before. Just know one of them won a Oscar Award in 1985 or something like so. I also know the creator is the one who made Chicken Run, which I loved.And, I saw this movie with Spanish dubbing (latin American), so I wasn't be able to see the Sellis, Fiennes and Bonham Carter's works. I guess I have to wait till the DVD version in order to do it.But, what a great movie. Funny, sweet and lovely, all at the same time. I just loved the first picture they showed to us, that one where are Wallace and the one year old Gromit. And then all that stuff about vegetables and the people's worries about their carrots, pumpkins and cauliflowers. And all those references to those old movies, were just great; I laughed out loud with the King Kong one (maybe because I just saw the trailer a moment before). I totally loved Lady Tottington with her dresses and her hair. And Victor's dog. I want to see this movie again! And can't wait for the DVD.Everyone have to see this movie. Definitely one of the best of this year."
55,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,10 October 2005,(inevitably...) Cracking!,"It has all the things we know and love from Wallace and Gromit's shorts while not suffering from being a re-run or expanded beyond its ability to sustain the inventiveness and fun.The audience I was in had a very broad spectrum of ages and everyone seemed to love it with the humour working on all sorts of levels. While the film is full of references and sight gags they are funny in themselves with no knowledge of the source material (my girlfriend has never seen Thunderbirds, but laughed out loud at the light-up eyes on the ""alert portraits"", for example).Wallace continues to be really clever, yet completely gormless at the same time, and Gromit is still the real brains of the outfit with more communication from his expressions than most animated characters manage despite not even having a mouth. Individually and as a team they are both characters you can root for, the villain is a great villainous cad and the heroine is great classic heroine material. The backdrops are all meticulous masterpieces, the set pieces brilliantly animated, breathtaking and never losing their humour even when the tension is racked up.I suppose there are people that won't like it, but it's a bit like not liking Toy Story. The script, animation and characters are all top-notch, it's not too short and not too long, so what's not to like? I am usually very wary of giving 10s to anything, as they suggest nothing could be done better. But it's hard to think where any improvements could be wrought with this. Only downside was the supporting feature, a Dreamworks short with the Madagascar Penguins. We enjoyed the first 20 seconds of the credits to Were-Rabbit more than everything in the support feature put together..."
56,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,9 October 2005,"Paroxysms of laughter, and more besides","This is the funniest movie I've seen in a long, long time. I was in hysterics for a good while, and so was my comrade Thalia. Unfortunately, we were two of the only four people in the giant theatre if you count the couple making out in the back row. This movie deserves a vastly better audience than that.Are you familiar with the phrase ""paroxysms of laughter""? Well, I was in those. And convulsions of guffaws. And spasms of utter hilarity. And then it got even funnier. Oh, sweet Isaac Newton, protect me. This movie had a climax worthy of the word. If laughter were a physical entity, they would have needed ten elephant keepers to shovel up mine afterwards.Wallace and Gromit are in the pest control business. Wallace is the brilliant inventor -- technology is good! -- and Gromit is the backbone of the operation. They catch and cage rabbits that prey on people's gardens. However, in the excited build-up to the Giant Vegetable Competition on Lady Tottington's estate, there appears a giant garden-wrecking bunny that somehow eludes capture. Wallace and Gromit have to capture it before Laddy Tottington's repellent gun-crazy suitor murders it with his barbaric guns.The action is great. The dialogue is excellent. The sexual innuendo is sublime. The claymation is captivating. It is brilliant on every level.GO SEE IT. THE HYPNOLEO COMMANDS YOU."
57,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,12 September 2005,just fun,"there is something about some children movies that are so compulsive to watch, it kinda feels like a guilty pleasure. Wallace and gromit is one of these pleasure.Being a fan from the early short clips, and a lot of the Aardman clay-animation, i had the feel i wasn't going to be disappointed, and i wasn't. I love how a lot of the humor transcends other kids movies, even though they do play a lot on stereotypes of small towns; there is always that crazy old lady or man and they do get the best laughs. The humor is quite tongue-in-cheek, and a lot of the situations aren't over played. They do the joke then roll to the next. Its so redundant when a movie stretches a joke to its absolute limit that it isn't funny anymore.The premise is a simple one, a town crazy about growing vegetables is under attack by a mass rabbit problem, and a giant were-rabbit. Wallace and Gromit then have to catch this were-rabbit before the tottington vegetable festival.Instead of placing a lot of celebrities as voices, Helena Bonham Carter is Lady Tottington and Ralph Fiennes is Lord Victor. Both do great jobs, but Helena was just perfect casting as the voice of Tottington. I feel she is an very under-rated actress.In all i had great fun watching this movie."
58,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,11 September 2005,24 Carrot Gold,"If you've enjoyed the previous Wallace and Gromit stories or you're a fan of British humour or you simply love animation, you are in for a treat.Subtle (and not so subtle) humour is mixed in with superb animation (or claymation as Aardman like to call it) and an original entertaining storyline to give us ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". Wallace and Gromit's village is plagued with rabbits at the time of the annual giant vegetable competition and their latest business venture is as humane pest controllers. Watch out for visual gags and listen out for the numerous puns.Unfortunately, the cinema trailer gives a lot of the plot away, which slightly detracted from our overall enjoyment. Our 4 year old loved it as did we: memories of ""Watership Down"" were stirred on one occasion! A superb English voice cast enhanced the enjoyment: Helena Bonham Carter as Lady Tottington was great. My favourite character was the vicar. Fans of Hammer House of Horror and old Dracula and Werewolf movies will have a good chuckle.Enjoy!"
59,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,8 May 2009,Cracking good entertainment for the whole family!,"The film starts with a very funny short featuring the Madagascar penguins. Curse of the Were Rabbit isn't as good as the three classic shorts, and the recent Matter of Loaf and Death, but the visual jokes and the memorable characters delight. I particularly loved the one about stinking cheese, and when Victor Quartermine puts the rabbit on his head by mistake. The plot is inspired, about a were rabbit who eats all the vegetables, and Wallace and Gromit try to stop him. The voice talents are superb, with Peter Sallis a standout with his vocal characterisation of Wallace, as does Ralph Fiennes as Victor. Helena Bonham Carter also does well, but the highlight was Gromit, with his facial expressions. The script sparkled with wit, imagination and inspiration, and the ending had some poignancy. Technically, the film is faultless with superb claymation. Overall, I award Curse of the Were Rabbit 8/10. Bethany Cox"
60,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,21 March 2006,Supasses all expectations - easily one of the greatest animated films ever conceived!,"It's refreshing to see an animation that doesn't rely only on computer graphics; it's even more refreshing to see that the film uses plasticise figures - and as if it couldn't get any more refreshing - the latest Wallace and Gromit adventure is one great big tribute to one of the greatest types of horror film in existence - Hammer Horror! The film starts off with a delicious sequence that sees a policeman patrolling a dark and gloomy English street. From there, we get treated to a whole host of locations that wouldn't look out of place in a Hammer film, and a plot that isn't too far removed from a classic monster movie either. The whole film is put together with a real good nature, and creator Nick Park excellently ensures that every scene is great fun to watch and every joke gets the laughs. The plot follows Wallace and Gromit in their latest business venture - Anti-Pesto - a company that provides a humane way of dealing with pests, such as bunny rabbits. After Wallace's experiment to deprogram the rabbits from eating people's vegetables goes disastrously wrong, the duo finds themselves dealing with a monstrous 'were-rabbit'! I really can't get over how much fun this movie is. I don't usually like animated films enough to really heap praise on them, but this film is an exception. The way that the plot moves is brilliant, and the screenplay ensures that you're constantly entertained while trying to guess the mystery behind the were-rabbit. Scenes such as the underground car chase, and 'dog-fight' is brilliant; but it's the sly humour that works best. Animation has come a long way over the past decade, and now animated films are no longer just for kids; there is something for everyone here. Kids will enjoy the more prominent humour, while the older members of the audience can amuse themselves with nods towards classic films, and the more adult humour. 'Angry Mob supplies' and Peter Kay's policeman's theory on the vegetables going missing being down to 'arson' are particular highlights! Wallace and Gromit fans will be glad to know that Peter Sallis still provides the voice of the human element of the duo, whilst bigger names such as Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes are excellent in support roles. On the whole, this film is every bit as good as you've no doubt heard it is. The Curse of the Were-Rabbit will appeal to all audience members, and it is with that in mind that I highly recommend it regardless of who you are what you like!"
61,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,19 March 2006,Hilarious!,"Without a doubt, this is the funniest movie I've seen in ages. I know that I saw the original Wallace and Gromit shorts as a kid, but to be honest I don't remember them in the least. So basically this was my introduction to the world of W & G...and what an introduction it was! First of all, I absolutely loved all the crazy contraptions. From the Gromitt controlled she-rabbit to the Bun-Vac 6000, I laughed at every single one. Throughout the film the expressions on Gromit's face were priceless, certainly one of the high points. Finally, I loved all the hidden film references, as well as a few hidden dirty jokes. Hilarious! To sum it up...see this film! I know I'll be tracking down the original shorts in the near future...9/10"
62,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,6 March 2006,Cute...and Clever?,"""Wallace and Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is a very good movie. I expected it to be childish, and (since this is 2006) I expected it to be just plain goofy and full of potty humor, or the victim of another irritating Hollywood scheme to appeal to the ""new generation"". But this movie was not only cute, it was also very clever. It takes a few watches to catch all of the little funnies and jokes, but it's undoubtedly no pain to watch multiple times. This movie is a breath of fresh air, and I hope that more Wallace & Gromit movies are released in the future. There was a brain behind ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"", and it shows when you compare it to most of today's cartoons."
63,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,6 February 2006,First full-length feature for the inventor and his trusty dog,"The next movie offering from Nick Park and Co. out of England following the breakout hit of Summer 2000,""Chicken Run"",was this first(?) official feature film treatment of the popular ""Wallace and Grmoit"",not counting the 2000 straight-to-video collection of short films,another offering I greatly appreciated.The absent-minded inventor and his mute but wise dog are competitive gardeners,who are prepping for the local garden show. This is an enterprise that the whole town(an unspecified town in England)seems to be heavily involved. When a menacing,mutated rabbit-creature start raiding people's gardens and greenhouses,savaging heads of lettuce and various other vegetables. As the fair nears,the locals panic over the impending loss of all their prize growth,and W & G spring into action to ferret out and catch the culprit. When they go investigating the ""Were-rabbit"" in question,they discover something they weren't prepared to tackle.The usual misshapen,simple yet sweet Britfolk that Mr.Park and his studio portrays through their claymations are every bit the charm of this show. The attention to detail is brilliant and the madcap humor is probably going to feel retro and cheap to some,but to those who like a simple story to be amused by,this film will be more than sufficient.The vocal talents of Helena Bonham CArter(as the awkward and gorfy potential love interest of Wallace's) and Ralph Fiennes(As her grumpy,callous suitor) are added for good measure. I cannot,off-hand recall,who voices the Inventor,but he makes the character distinctive and lovably clueless. This is a simple movie to grade,and were it maybe a slight bit shorter and not sensibly padded out(my opinion) toward the end,this film would be a ten. As is,it's a cute,well-executed animated film of pain-staking quality. It made it even more of a shame that the studios where these animations were made and many of the reels kept burned down not long after this show was released. Hopefully,this won't curb the production of future projects,though given the hiatus between films,I imagine it just might. A shame indeed!"
64,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,28 January 2006,Tom and Jerry for the modern age,"Animation has, since about 1990, taken two distinct paths. Firstly there is the simple graphics, and satirical humour, of television series like 'The Simpsons' and 'South Park'. Secondly, there is the high-tech, computer-assisted animation of 'Toy Story' and its numerous successors. Both types of ""cartoons"" have been widely praised, but personally, although I have some favourites, I usually find it impossible to get over-excited about these genres. So much of comedy lies in the subtleties of facial expression, and this is something rarely paid much attention to in animated tales (either that, or, for all the high-tech, it's simply not something that is not yet easy to do well).Nick Park makes films in a style - ""claymation"", the incremental movement of actual physical models - that is so labour-intensive it should by rights have died out a long time ago. Yet there's an honest charm in movies of this type, the physical labour involved in producing them transparently visible on the screen. And such an unslick method of film making almost perfectly suits the gentle, but wildly inventive, humour of 'Wallace and Gromit', a Yorkshire inventor and his improbably monikered dog, who are Park's most endearing and enduring creations. Wallace's own ingenuity perfectly perfectly reflects that of his creator, and the scenes are all the funnier from the sheer effort that has obviously gone into making them. Whereas in some computer animations, the sense that everything is possible actually reduces the impact of each thing you see, this is definitely not the case with 'Wallace and Gromit'. Now, after ten years, the dynamic duo have actually got their own full-length movie. And it's a delight. The laughs-per-minute ratio does not quite match their earlier, shorter, films, but it's still pretty good, the original material combining with a number of spoof references to various famous films. What I love about Wallace and Gromit is the pacing; visually, there's something going on in the background almost continuously, the films are very rich (unlike most animations where the backdrop is essentially static), and yet the whole thing gives an impression of an amiable amble through Park's imaginary world.I was relatively unimpressed by 'Chicken Run', Park's earlier full-length movie, finding it hard to relate to the characters (even if they were chickens!) But I I already loved Wallace and Gromit prior to watching this film, and had no such problems here. Peter Sallis is excellent as always as the voice of Wallace, although the other celebrity voices are unremarkable. But this is perhaps just a way of saying that their real-life personalities do not self-consciously protrude into the movie; for all the in-jokes, this is definitely not a post-modern film, and all the better for it. Just one tiny quibble - one tiny concession has been made to the American market, when Wallace dreams of cheese he dreams first of ""Monterrey Jack"" - surely some mistake? But this is an utterly charming movie, almost anachronistic but very very funny. And for all the advances in modern technology, the true spirit of 'Tom and Jerry', it seems, is alive and well in a warehouse near Bristol."
65,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,10 November 2005,The new PIxar?,"MORE MORE MORE! Andrea True must have been thinking of Wallace & Gromit when she wrote that, because I was actually sad when the final credits rolled. A big fan of the W&G films, I had been anticipating this for a long, long time, and believe you me it did NOT let me down. A great tribute to b-horror film and to the classic film archetypes, a mixture of great voice acting and stellar claymation - the sets in this put the W&G shorts to SHAME - this film has a lot in it for all ages, and kids and adults alike will love this film, for different reasons perhaps, but love nonetheless.This is one of the films of the year for me. If it doesn't win the Oscar for animated film I'll be tempted to send poison pen letters to every member of the Academy. It prompted me to finally dump my W&G cassettes and buy the DVD just to get the extras. It took them two years to make, and you can sense the hardship of every single day's worth of effort they put into it. Pixar be damned, I want more Wallace and Gromit!My highest recommendations - and I hope I haven't hyped it up beyond your expectations, but it surpassed each and every one of mine. 9.5/10."
66,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,6 November 2005,Easily One of the Year's Best!,"I was first introduced to Wallace and Gromit in the mid-1990s. Despite their astounding popularity in Britain, overseas success had primarily been limited to several Oscars for animation and minor cult status. W & G possess a thoroughly British sense of style and humor, which is often lost on viewers from other parts of the world. In addition, many viewers, myself included, were rather unappreciative of the painstaking labor required to manipulate clay for the purposes of entertainment. It wasn't until the release of Chicken Run in 2000 that I finally realized the immense talent of Park & Co. Chicken Run was a surprise hit that helped bring renewed interest to Wallace & Gromit. Five years and thousands of man-hours later, the eccentric duo is back in its first big-screen outing.Wallace is a naïve inventor who, with the help of his trusty, ingenious dog Gromit, runs a humane relocation program for the hordes of rabbits terrorizing gardens in the area. An upcoming ""Best Vegetable"" competition has the entire neighborhood on edge. Desperate to put an end to his clients' woes, Wallace attempts to create a new device that will rid local pests of their herbivorous tendencies. Needless to say, good-natured mayhem ensues.This film's cleverness and warm-hearted optimism are a welcome change from the formulaic, in-your-face nonsense that pervades much of today's family features. While this film's humor may seem a bit cheesy at times, Wallace will be the first to tell you that cheese can be a wonderful thing.Rating: A-"
67,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,30 October 2005,Absolutely fantastic - Best film of the year,"These days, I think I've developed a more discriminating critical eye when it comes to movies and I'm usually not one for superlatives but I feel I have no choice when it comes to this absolute bloody delight from claymation master Nick Park.I think going into this film I'd forgotten just how much I enjoyed the other Wallace & Gromit films (the short ones) and so I can't say I was looking forward to this feature-length effort with any great slavering anticipation, but after about twenty minutes I knew I was in for a wonderful treat.Basically, stripped down to nuts and bolts, this film is not a masterpiece - in fact it's nothing more than a romp. But it is so clever, so beautifully paced, and funny? Oh me oh my - I honestly cannot remember a funnier film. Not since I watched ""Bringing Up Baby"" many years ago have I laughed out loud so often, it's just done to absolute perfection. The quaint, whimsical story is lots of fun, the humour is directed at young and old alike, there are so many little subtle jokes along the way. I mean, it's great, I can't really add much more.All there really is to add is that this is a must-see, and I know it's being incredibly flippant, but when it comes round again to Oscars time, I'm boycotting the Academy if this doesn't scoop up a whole heap of trophies. Screw best feature-length animation, Were-Rabbit for Best Picture! Seriously, in a fairly lacklustre year in cinema, this is an absolute gem. I haven't felt this satisfied and respected as an audience member since Million Dollar Baby, THAT is why I declare this clearly to be the best film of the year."
68,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,26 October 2005,A Devastatingly Irresistible flick after my own heart!,"I have always considered myself a hardened cynic who doesn't even like movies that much, but Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a Force of Nature to be reckoned with! The delightfully nutty, cheese-loving inventor and the faithful pooch with the deepest, most soulful eyes ever to grace the silver screen are taking the movie world by storm with unprecedented grace, innocence, warmth, humor, and unpretentiousness. So far, I have yet to meet a person who does NOT like this flick. I absolutely LOVE this movie and think everyone should go and see it at least once. I am incidentally having a terrible week feeling both stressed out and physically unwell, but the mere sight of this dynamic duo is enough to put a smile on my face and make me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. Having said that, I think a person who is not in the slightest bit affected by the sheer sweetness and charm of W&G should have his/her pulse checked!"
69,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,21 October 2005,Absolutely brilliant,See it. Again and again. There are so many hilarious laugh out loud moments in this film that you miss others (as I have discovered from the message boards!) so you need to watch this more than once to see the true genius of Nick Park's latest work. I won't spoil the film for those who haven't seen it by mentioning any but if you have any sort of sense of humour you will laugh out loud during this film.Considering that (as the promotional bumpf tells us) 3 seconds of footage was shot each day and this film was 5 years in the making - this is a masterpiece! Lesser people would have given up (I wouldn't have even started) but be thankful that Aardman stuck it through and produced this cracker of a film. Go and see it - they deserve to have it watched and enjoyed by as many people as possible and you should feel honoured to watch as superb a film as this.
70,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,21 October 2005,classic,"Okay, Nightmare and Corpse Bride were amazingly done with clay. But what really took my interest in Wallace and Gromit was that you could see fingerprints on the clay figures. I really liked that a lot and it somewhat made me want to pick up the characters and play with them like two dolls. I think they did an excellent job with the animation and I congratulate the hard working team. Did anyone else like the fingerprints on the clay figures? At first I didn't like it, but then i really grew to like it's originality. So anyone have an opinion on the fingerprints or was it just annoying? I know it annoyed my friend. She said it made the movie seem messy and unclean....ah well.."
71,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,21 October 2005,Superb. One for the Kids and their parents.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I wasn't sure at first if the material could stretch from the usual short film lengths to a full blown feature film but I needn't have worried. The trademark Wallace and Gromit humour was there in abundance and lots of in jokes for the adults that would be over the heads of most kids. The voice acting is fantastic and am very pleased to see one of my favourite British Comedians (Peter Kay) doing one of the voices.. although I didn't think he had much to say and his own brand of humour didn't shine through.. but then the film wasn't about him was it? Don't just take my word for it. Go to the movie with the kids, go again by yourself, go with your significant other. You'll love it. I did"
72,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,20 October 2005,Fun for all the family - grandparents too!!,"Last Saturday morning my husband and I made our way to our local cinema in Worcester to see this film. However we thought we wouldn't be admitted because we didn't have the obligatory kids in tow! Thankfully the staff smiled at us benignly and let us pass. That said I must now inform all of you out there that in fact this is very definitely a film for kids of all ages. The jokes aimed at the under twelve brigade were just as spot on and apposite as those directed at us adults. I have one proviso though for all you big kids - keep a watch on everything in the background, book titles in Wallace's house are a particular joy. There are a number of slightly smutty jokes which would go way over the head of the average eight year old not least that Lady Tottington asks the lovestruck Wallace to call her ""Totty"". Peter Sallis, Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter voice the characters beautifully. Gromit must have the most expressive forehead in movie history (The New York Times critic felt his forehead alone deserved an Oscar!)Do see this film, the memory of it will keep you happy probably for a lifetime!"
73,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,20 October 2005,"Job well done, lads!","Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the most fun movies I have seen recently. Having seen the 3 short W&G movies, I had high expectations. The film was amazing and didn't let me down at all, it was even better than expected. It's beauty was for me mostly in the details and the clay-animation was superb: a stunning visual masterpiece from start to finish. It's very funny (for kids as well as for adults) and there's a lot of references to other, mostly classic- and horror-films. The story wasn't too complex, but very entertaining. It's also clearly very British, which I find very charming. It's one of my favorite animated films, a movie that really stands out in a genre dominated by computer-animation. Jobs well done, lads!"
74,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,20 October 2005,Great,"After 3 shorties, now the long movie. And it is absolutely fun! No words about the story, it's really surprising and everybody should see this! The technique is absolutely fantastic, the speed brilliant, the gags powerful, and the music amazing. And all the wonderful citations are great (like the ""M. Batt"", you will know what I mean when you see both movies). The best scene for me is at the beginning, when Wallace and Gromit are in the preparation process for the ""hunting"". I will see this scene docents of times when I have it on DVD (can't wait for it!). And if you are in a good cinema, and if you have good eyes, you will see this real hand made technique, because in some scenes you can see the fingerprints on the figures... So, go out see this movie!!! Heavenicetrip! Fe/2"
75,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,18 October 2005,"Funny, touching, tense...hard to fault","Any self respecting W&G fan should see this movie. Any self respecting person should watch this movie. I hadn't actually watched the duo in quite a while and it was a great pleasure to hear the theme music come in at the start - it puts the whole thing in its quirky perspective of Britishness. In fact, the music throughout the movie was great.Plenty of gags come quick and fast. Wallace is wonderfully silly. Gromit's silent yet beautifully expressive face gives him a lot of character. Both young and old can enjoy this movie, 5 years in the making. If you ask me, those were 5 years well spent. The story gives a lot of nods to old British horror movies and others like King Kong, as well as throwing in some really nice twists along the way to keep everything moving.I really don't know what else to say about this movie. See it. Enjoy it. Go home humming the theme tune, still smiling at the gags."
76,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,15 October 2005,Good film for all the family,"This is a thumbs up for a film that is as entertaining for the adults as the children.This is a film that operates at a number of levels. For younger viewers it is a great primer for classic horror within a non-threatening, humour filled vehicle.For film buffs there are references by the score.I think that the stop-motion filming gives time for the makers to consider and introduce a plethora of nice touches. Wallace has been putting on weight, as the camera pans across the kitchen table it passes a marmalade jar labelled 'Middle Age Spread'. This attention to detail is evident in nearly every scene, and I am positive further viewing will prove I missed a lot of gags - and I will be re-viewing this film.My girls, 14 & 11, both loved the movie - the elder seeing it for the 2nd time today.A VERY solid recommendation."
77,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,10 October 2005,Simply Superb!,"this was one of (with The Corpse Bride) the best films of the year! Wallace and Gromit are claymation heroes! the pair of them never fail to entertain and this, their first (and hopefully not last) feature length film is a cracking good time for all! With chases, puns, homages to famous films and lets not forget the CHEESE, it's a superb entertainment for (sorry Ringling Brothers) Children of All Ages! Gromit is as usual, the star, since even though he doesn't speak, his expressions are great. He drives, flies and runs to help his rather erratic (but well meaning) master. Wallace as usual is in over his head. What would he do without Gromit? If you've never seen them before, don't worry, this is a great intro to the claymation pair!Don't just sit around reading this review! Hurry to the theater and see this film!"
78,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,9 October 2005,Loved it.,"I've been a fan of claymation since the early days of Creature Comforts and the British Gas commercials. It's a marvelous medium, lending itself perfectly to the wry humour of Britain. Hand drawn cartoons may no longer be ""cost-effective"" in the new world of computer graphics, but computer generated characters often seem brash and unsubtle. I'm glad there is still a market for a lovingly hand made film like this; Wallace and Gromit, the Curse of the Were Rabbit, Nick Park's latest.In Wallace and Gromit, Nick Park has created truly wonderful characters and this movie is entertaining and funny on many levels. As Brits of a certain age we appreciated the small details; the car, the dire wallpaper in the houses, the garden gnomes, the cosy fantasy of a 1950s England that never existed. But people who don't appreciate all the cultural details will still enjoy the characters, the marvelous animation and the story of inventor Wallace and his trust mutt Gromit, as pest control operatives, trying to solve the bunny problem in a Yorkshire village preparing for the giant vegetable show. It never sinks to the cutesy, sentimental level of so many animated films, and is always entertaining and witty.Silent Gromit says more with a barely raised eyebrow, than most actors do with a full length script. Bunnies get sucked into the Bun-Vac as Wallace and Gromit try to control them humanely against the dastardly plans of villainous hunter Quartermaine, and as the villagers cosset their giant veggies in the run up to the show, a giant Were Rabbit threatens to ruin it all. There's even a marvelous car chase. This movie is a timeless and charming masterpiece."
79,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,8 October 2005,Funny funny FUNNY movie!!!!,"If you need a laugh (and who doesn't really) do yourself a favor and go see this movie! Cheerful, kind and somewhat eccentric inventor Wallace and loyal dog Gromit (aka ""The Brains of the Outfit""...) are back with another fun and fantastic adventure in ""Curse of the Wererabbit"".No spoilers here - you'll just have to go and see for yourself how hysterical this movie is!The short featuring the penguins from ""Madagascar"" was also too funny.This film is a ""Grand Day Out"" for all of W&G fans! (Sorry, couldn't resist)Peace! PlatinumRoseLadyAnime Diva & Proud Supporter Of Boromir"
80,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,9 October 2005,Entertaining all round!,"Considering it took Aardman so long to get this film to the big screen, the anticipation mounted and pressure was on. I wasn't disappointed! This film is entertaining, fast-moving and visually stunning. I was laughing throughout and as the best animations usually do, there are more jokes for adults than kids! Watch out for all the wonderful little touches and movie references as well.Over all, W&G was fun with a great story, lovable and well-written characters and immaculate pacing. And my hero Gromit is the most expressive non-speaking character on the big screen! Much recommended, to fans and non-fans alike."
81,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,16 September 2005,Another Nick Park classic,"If you enjoyed the other Ardman Wallace and Gromit short films, you'll absolutely love ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". Made in the same genre as the previous short films, the characters are even more endearing in Nick Park's latest. Wallace's heart has again been stolen, this time by a hilarious Lady Tottington, played by British actress Helena Bonham Carter. This quintessentially English caricature had me rolling in the aisles. The animation is typical Ardman claymation, and the script is a winner. Like the previous films, this one is sure to be a hit with the wee ones, but it has even more subtle and clever humor for the older folk. This is a must-see. Two thumbs up!"
82,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,21 November 2016,A Hutch A  Do About Nothing,"Cracking film! What a film! The film is amazing and funny. Very British. People who can't understand the accent and says its Canadian, are just dumb. Like come on, the film's set in England, does not take a Wallace to figure out where the film is set. Aside from the stupid people who don't know what they are on about. The film is amazing. Watched it for the first time in about 7 years and still laughed at the quirky British jokes. Well done Ardman. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a good British film and not see some Hugh Grant RomCom that's dated so badly its funny. ""It's poetry in motion"" - Daniel Coombs"
83,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,25 February 2016,Looks Adorable,"The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of those rare animated films that can be enjoyed and laughed at even by adults. And it's not due to adult"" humour but by simply being smart and clever. It's as much a comedy as an animated film.My favourite part was the kid horror, for lack of a better term. The sort of Halloween-ized scary moments"" always make me nostalgic for my childhood and this film uses them to good effect. And the clay animation is just adorable. The rabbits particularly are some of the cutest I've ever seen.In many ways this is a film that only the British could make. It creates a quaint little country village where our two main heroes work as pest control. Not being familiar with the original Wallace and Gromit shorts I don't know how accurate the adaptations here are, but nevertheless they are very likable.But what I liked best is that the film didn't try to be too big. Usually films of this type try to add unnecessary character drama or backstories. This plot is not longer than it needs to be, but just right. Overall it is a simple story but there is nothing to complain about in this film."
84,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,28 September 2015,Cracking film,"The lovable duo Wallace & Gromit got their first big screen outing in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The point was always going to be on how they could stretch the successful shorts into film length and I'm pleased to say that I think they do a fantastic job by keeping much of the same formula that was present in the original shorts. The eccentric characters and subtle humour remain at the forefront thankfully, while Wallace is still an endearingly unconventional inventor and his mute dog Gromit acts as the perfect straight-man. I feel that putting the characters in a film length piece is a logical progression compared to a lot of other TV based shows or series. The plot mixes the zaniness of the shorts with an effective comedic horror approach. In it our title characters run their own humane pest-control company named Anti-Pesto and find themselves overrun with issues involving rabbits in the run up to the village vegetable competition. Suddenly a large beast starts eating the locals' crops, Anti-Pesto look to stop it and Wallace aims to win the affection of Lady Tottington by doing so. It's a fun little plot that knows just when to play up the comedy and when to just let things breathe for a minute. There is a nice twist that may be a little predictable for some people, but for what the story is it offers plenty of laughs and appropriate touches of mystery.In a storyline such as this good characters are crucial and that is what we get. Wallace (Peter Sallis) is as quirky as ever, enjoying his cheese and bizarre inventions. He also gets plenty of funny lines, ''with a big trap'' being particularly amusing. Gromit is still enjoyably brainy and slightly sardonic, while it always impresses me how much personality they get from just his expressions and movements. Lady Tottington is a little bland on the whole, but she does have some fun scenes with Wallace. Victor (an enjoyably hammy Ralph Fiennes) isn't as creative or sinister a villain as his predecessors, but he is good fun. His snooty nature makes you want to dislike him and he gets his fair share of funny lines too. I also really like the local villagers, especially the quick to panic Reverend who is hilarious, and most of their lines are witty as well as memorable.Claymation is always difficult to do and takes a great deal of time, so it is incredibly easy to admire the amount of work that has gone into the films look. There are also a higher number of locations and characters used than ever before. As said I think the comedy in the film is done really well and it fits in with the originals humour as well as being able to appeal to many people. There are a lot of lines that are memorable for how strange or whacky they are, but there's also a number of great references to other films or works of fiction that are usually smart and understated. The climax is excellent and really delivers on the thrills as well as the laughs. The score (provided by Julian Nott) is very good and brings plenty of excitement to certain scenes, while it's always great to hear the fantastic main theme.It's difficult to find a fault with The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, in that it is pretty much what you would want from a Wallace & Gromit film. It does add more characters and a wider variety of jokes, but it hasn't forgotten its roots or what made it so entertaining in the first place. It remembers that people were drawn to the unusual characters and the funny situations. It's easy to appreciate the effort that Aardman have put into the film and it's always great to see characters that have become almost iconic on the big screen."
85,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,15 September 2015,Claymation Excellence.,"Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005): Dir: Nick Park, Steve Box / Voices: Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, Peter Sallis, Peter Kay, Nicholas Smith: From the creators of Chicken Run comes this amusing and often funny claymation about fear and confusion. Wallace and his smart dog Gromit own a pest control company. The giant vegetable competition is upcoming but a strange beast is destroying the crops. Directors Nick Park and Steve Box are backed with a clever screenplay. Peter Sallis voices Wallace who is an inventor out to solve a problem regarding rabbits only to have it backfire. Gromit is his faithful dog who suspects more than what is floating on the surface. He will also be instrumental in solving the plot problem. Other roles are mainly standard issue although certain voice talents help. Ralph Fiennes voices the antagonist whose scheme will reverse on itself, and Helena Bonham Carter voices what will become the potential love interest, but in the mean time she heads the festival and witnesses the havoc. Other characters are flat and pale in comparison to the two lead heroes. While this is easily another creative claymation wonder, it doesn't quite achieve the level of success of Chicken Run and its clever references to prison films It does succeed in dealing with a less adult subject matter than film, with its warped references to what one creates. Score: 9 / 10"
86,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,25 June 2015,Great Movie,"It's incredible what these guys are able to do with claymation. It is a fantastic- looking film. The claymation is beautiful.But more than that, it is very, very funny. It is more than a usual comedy. It has great jokes as well as visual comedy. The comedy is perfect for all ages. You can watch it when you're young, and then watch it years later and realize all of the jokes you missed.And finally, is a very well-acted, and well-written film. The voice-acting is great, the writing of the jokes as well as the plot is absolutely wonderful. The story, concept, and humor are nearly perfect.It is a great film and one of the best animated pictures ever."
87,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,2 May 2015,"Oh ho ho, cracking job, Aardman!","Zany, delightful, appealing horror spoof chronicling the feature length adventures of Wallace (voice of Peter Sallis), our beloved cheese obsessed gadget creator, and his faithful dog Gromit. Here, Wallace & Gromit operate a company called Anti-Pesto, which disposes of pests such as rabbits in humane ways. Seeking to curb the destructive nature of rabbits, Wallace tries out his new mind control invention. You guessed it: he creates a monster, but not in the way that you might think.The uniquely British humour of this upbeat, energetic animated feature is in full bloom. These characters are completely endearing and played to the hilt by a peerless cast. Sallis is wonderful as the voices of both Wallace and Hutch. Helena Bonham Carter voices a potential love interest for Wallace, the regal Lady Tottington who wants to rid her land of critters without harming them. Ralph Fiennes is hilarious as Victor Quartermaine, the obnoxious jerk who thinks *he's* going to marry Lady Tottington. And of course there's the lovable Gromit, who's at his most priceless reacting to other characters, particularly Wallace, as he rolls his eyes, does a facepalm, and shakes his head.Top notch clay animation and deliciously goofy character designs combine in this superior bit of entertainment that can appeal to both older and younger viewers.Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I fancy a bit of cheese...Eight out of 10."
88,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,30 January 2015,Ignore the haters,"The first half of this film is brilliant. The animation is predictably stunning, Fiennes and Bonham Carter are outstanding and the story develops seamlessly. The Vicar, who benefits from some exceptional screen writing, is especially brilliant. The second half lacks the subtlety and skill of the first half, turning instead to 'crowd pleasing' action and clichés, much like 'A Close Shave' or the more recent short film. Nevertheless, whether or not you are familiar with the shorts I highly recommend this great animated comedy, particularly for families or as a light film for a date night."
89,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,11 February 2012,Fun and Entertaining!,"Wallace and Gromit is definitely a ""horror"" film all the kids will enjoy. The film is what is rare nowadays, a film that all ages could watch. I am happy they finally made a feature film on Wallace and Gromit. I have been a fan of all their shorts.Wallace and Gromit are on a mission to save their town and vegetables from a monstrous vegetable-loving were-rabbit.The voice work is pretty good. Ralph Fiennes certainly can be a villain even in an animated film. 2005 must be a good year for Helena Bonham Carter with her excellent voicework is both this and Corpse Bride.Overall, this is a fun film for the family. Even though I am a grown man, I felt some chills watching this. I also have to say the rabbits are kind of cute. I rate this film 8/10."
90,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,24 October 2011,Wallace and Gromit's first step into feature filmdom rises to the challenge,"The animation world's two best-kept secrets have always been Wallace and Gromit, and creator Nick Park continues to plant the evidence in the duo's first full-length feature, ""Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit."" Although the stop-motion shorts have won multiple Oscars and the concept seems better suited for more concise storytelling, the quick wit and charms remain along with that trademark tinge of horror.""Were-Rabbit"" follows Wallace and Gromit's latest business venture, Antipesto, a service that protects the prized vegetables of the town's residents from rabbits using Wallace's high-tech inventions. Fans of the characters will be comforted to hear that Aardman Animation doesn't just reset to zero and reintroduce Wallace and Gromit for the sake of a new audience given that this is a feature. There's a definite sense of continuity, with Gromit putting Wallace on a diet because of his weakness for cheese, a problem that's gotten bad enough that Wallace no longer slips easily through his bedroom trap door and into the kitchen  his longest standing invention.In this chapter, Wallace (Peter Sallis) finds himself in more trouble than usual and of course Gromit has to clean up the mess. The oddball inventor fancies the wealthy Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter), host of the annual largest vegetable contest, whom he and Gromit help in regards to her rampant rabbit problem. In hopes of targeting her affection, Wallace tries to combine two of his inventions in a way that would allow him to brainwash rabbits into not wanting any produce. The experiment goes wrong, however, and soon a terrifying monster begins to devour the town's crops at night. If that weren't enough, the Lady's other suitor, Victor Quartermaine (voiced with lovable panache by Ralph Fiennes) poses another threat.At times all of that is a bit much; the story does feel like a short film idea expanded into a feature and most of the twists are foreseeable. Although it doesn't have the same snap because certain sections drag, the craftsmanship and the execution never disappoints.""Were-Rabbit"" provides that expert blend of family adventure and horror that Aardman Animation has been known for. Like any expert creature feature, our gigantic beast is kept from the camera until the moment is perfect. The action sequences do not lack for excitement either thanks to creativity and the fact that they always give Gromit, cinema's most fiercely loyal canine, a chance to shine.As technology has improved, so has the use of computer effects in this series. Yet for every digital enhancement, an impressive claymation detail grabs our attention. The vegetables in particular have a lifelike appearance, so much so that I wouldn't be surprised to learn that smaller replicas of vegetables were carved out of real ones for use in the film.Yet the staple of the film, as has been the case with the previous shorts, remains the wit, the array of puns, the peripheral easter eggs and the tastefully crude jokes. A perfect family film slides those in without detracting from the entertainment value for children and ""Wallace & Gromit"" does just that. ~Steven CCheck out my site, moviemusereviews.com"
91,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,29 November 2010,Wallace finally hits the big screen...,"A man and his loyal canine run a ""friendly"" pest removal company, their cosy existence is shattered upon the arrival of a giant ""were-rabbit"", who is wreaking a trail of destruction on the locals with the annual Giant Fruit & Veg contest looming...Wallace & Gromit have been around for it seems forever, and their innocent adventures providing 25 minutes of entertainment to millions every few years when Nick Park saw fit to put together one of his painstaking hand made plasticine creations frame by frame.The announcement of a film length version was music to the ears of many, (including me) and it doesn't disappoint. Given that it takes weeks to film every couple of minutes of screen time the creators have ample time to consider the minutest details, which can be seen by those who watch closely... and then rewatch it.Some jokes will thankfully go over the head of the littlies, who will quite happily watch the bunnies and the clever doggie, but aside from Toy Story there really aren't as many adult-friendly moments in everything else on this list than there are in Wallace & Gromit.What you hope kids will learn: I really don't think they set out to teach in these films.What they'll take away: Wallace talks funny. And Gromit is very smart. And bunnies are very cute."
92,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,29 August 2010,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,"I fondly remember enjoying the Wallace and Gromit short films as a kid, namely A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers, so I was excited to see how the clay-mation duo's first feature film would turn out and if the old charm would still be there. I sure wasn't disappointed; The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is just as charming as the previous W&G adventures.When the story begins, there are only a few days left until the town's annual Giant Vegetable Competition, but the people's carefully grown contest entries are in danger of being eaten by the uncontrollable rabbit population of the region. Luckily the inventor Wallace and his loyal canine pal Gromit have started a humane pest control company that catches the rabbits and stores them in the basement of Wallace's house. However, due to an unfortunate mishap with a new invention, Wallace causes someone to unknowingly turn into a monstrous giant rabbit every night, endangering the whole contest. How can Gromit help Wallace to solve the situation before an obnoxious hunter called Victor finishes the rabbit off with a gold bullet?The character design and the stop-motion animation look as charming as always, and the familiar charisma of Wallace and Gromit never ceases to charm. While Wallace is a talkative and bumbling slapstick comedy character that will surely appeal to kids, the silent Gromit makes an excellent pairing for him and communicates only through his melancholic and frustrated facial expressions and other non-verbal means, even echoing the silent era of filmmaking. Besides the eponymous protagonists, the other characters are well designed too, especially the lovable Lady Tottington who becomes the love interest for both Wallace and Victor. The white-haired Reverend Hedges and his collection of anti-were-rabbit equipment also deserve a mention for evoking memories of classic horror film pastors. In addition, the Were-Rabbit itself looks very funny, both cuddly and a little menacing at the same time.The Reverend's character is not the only thing aimed at more mature audiences: there are references to literature and movies as well as jokes about Lady Tottington's ""melons"" and Wallace's ""nuts"" but such winks to older audience members never become too obvious like in some other family films I've seen. Even though hectic action scenes become more prominent towards the end of the story, they are well created and don't take too much of the runtime as I had worried. More of the humour stems from the relationships of the characters and Gromit's communication troubles with Wallace. The music by Julian Nott also belongs among the enjoyable details of the film; the familiar W&G theme keeps reappearing in the score in unexpected places and further provides more to spot for observant viewers.I haven't seen the film in its original language, but I doubt the English voice acting would give reasons to complain. All in all, it can be said that The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is well worth the praise it's been getting. Old and new fans of the characters have no reason to miss it out, and I hope the series will be continued in the future as well."
93,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,2 March 2009,Universal horror meets the house of Ealing?,"Just a few days to go until the Tottington Giant Vegetable competition kicks off. The villagers are feeling good due to the excellent work of Anti-Pesto, the protection firm run by Wallace and his trusty pooch, Gromit. But when a beast known as the Were-Rabbit starts to ravage the vegetables, the duo must raise their game to defeat the ultimate enemy.Brought to us by the considerable talents of Nick Park and Steve Box, this first full length feature film of the popular clay molded duo, delivers the fun and frivolity with carefree abandon. Tho funded by American Dreamworks Animation, Were-Rabbit is as British as you could get, the story leans heavily on Universal Monsters lore, but the setting and construction of the plot retains a truly British sensibility. The sight gags alone are worth watching the film for, but throw in the hilarious dialogue, the technical craft on offer {Nick Park currently owning three golden statues given to him by the academy} and a rip roaring ending, well it's an essential watch for anyone fond of animation and well crafted cinema. Hell!, they even manage to drop in a romantic sub-plot that benefits the picture, with often hilarious results courtesy of the scheming Victor Quartermaine {Ralph Fiennes}.Cool dog, cool story, just a real flipping great family treat, aye it be great Gromit, it be great. 8.5/10"
94,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,1 November 2007,A dandy little film that is just too cute for words,"Wallace & Gromit have been around for some time, but this was their first foray onto the silver screen. Fans of the British TV series, like myself, were eager to see them and the film did quite well in the theaters. Much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original. In a world of CG movies like SHREK and TOY STORY, this stop-motion film is a nice alternative to the trend in children's movies as well as being totally unlike a cartoon. Plus, compared to much earlier stop-motion films (such as KING KONG and the Ray Harryhausen films such as SINBAD), the quality and movement of the characters are light years better--looking very fluid, natural and more alive.Apart from the quality of the animation, this movie also deserves kudos on every other level. First, the voice actors do a great job. Second, the script is very simple but also very cute and enjoyable--with a few double-entendres that should probably go way over the kids' heads. Third, they manage to make this not only a movie for kids but people of all ages as the film is neither saccharine nor aimed solely at the younger crowd. In particular, I was captivated by incredibly cute the film was--and especially the adorable bunnies. I especially liked them in the closing credits--which made me very happy I stayed to watch the entire film.The bottom line is that unless you are a real stick-in-the-mud, you will enjoy this film. It's fresh, funny and amazingly clever. I hope we see a sequel--and this is saying something, as I usually hate sequels."
95,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,7 October 2006,"Fun, fun movie!","I have to admit: I watched Wallace & Grommit on hotel HBO. I had just flown in, was tired, looked for something on the tube, and found myself watching Wallace & Grommit, by myself, a grown man, and loved every minute of it! Yes, it's goofy and silly, like all kids' movies, but it also has a lot of subtle adult-targetted humor and some very witty sequences. Plus the claymation characters (even the bunnies) had insightful and smarmy facial expressions, sideways glances, properly-placed raised eyebrows, and other cues that really makes this a kick to watch.You can tell the filmmakers really liked what they were doing enough to take great care to turn out a quality product. If I was a parent, I'd make sure this was in the kids' DVD collection.9 out of 10 Barky"
96,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,22 May 2006,Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,"I've never really appreciated how much work goes into making a stop motion animation like Wallace & Gromit. It took 20 to 30 people to animate the film, and they could only make, at most, two minutes worth of film a week; no wonder the film took five years to makeBut that's the amazing thing. It took five years, and yet the result is better than almost all of the CGI animations that have come out in the last few years. If you enjoyed the three Wallace & Gromit shorts, and/or Chicken Run, then you will adore this film. Wallace and Gromit, as well as creator Nick Park, have certainly grown since they started out  everything is bigger, better, more elaborate, more accomplished and crucially, even funnier. There is so much to appreciate in this film that it almost warrants two viewings just to make sure you catch it all. The comedy is fresh and genuinely funny, not needing to resort to simple slapstick humour to squeeze a laugh out; it all flows so naturally.The story revolves around a small village which is about to hold its annual vegetable growing competition. Wallace and Gromit have a company called Anti-Pesto, which safeguards the vegetables from any would-be thieves. However, soon their defences are broken as something begins to terrorise the neighbourhood and eat all the vegetables. Wallace and Gromit must find what's responsible before the competition.The voice cast are all perfect. Ralph Fiennes makes a very good pompous suitor to Helena Bonham Carter's rich Lady Tottington, and of course the brilliant Peter Sallis is back to give life to everyone's favourite inventor. Hats off to Nick Park though, for his creation of Gromit. Despite not having the ability to speak, Gromit can show more emotion than anyone else merely through expression, and his lovable nature and dogged (sorry!) determination give us arguably the greatest character that animation has given us since he became real in 1989.There may be those who are worried that Wallace & Gromit are just for the younger ones. However, there is so much to enjoy for all ages; adults and children alike will be laughing all the way through. There is no difference in quality compared to the earlier shorts, either; all too often a short can get turned into a feature film and it will lose much of its charm, but this film does not suffer from this. If anything, it's even better. Nick Park must surely win another Oscar for this, and it will take a lot for another animation to take away the title of ""best animation of 2005"" from Wallace and Gromit.Rated: 9/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"
97,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,6 November 2005,Movie parody with Wallace and Gromit,"I love the earlier shorter Wallace and Gromit stories, and have Chickenrun as one of my all-time favorite movies, but this didn't really make the top grade. As usual the puppetry was first class, the voices likewise, and I loved the beginning with the reverend blessing his veg's, so that he would win the annual garden fête, this year, sprinkling holy water of the pumpkins.And that Wallace and Gromit are good rabbiters, but that they can't get themselves to kill them, I can buy.Even the Were-rabbit I swallow, but when too many parodies of old horror classics are included in one, it get a bit too much for me.Then it becomes too little originality, and too much copy-cat. And I think we've seen too many garden fêtes go wrong in too many British movies, for this one to get top billing!With all this meta-movie material one wonders if they done it to gain an Oscar, as the members of the Oscars all are movie pros, active or retired. It usually is a good way of getting a nomination!Chickenrun just parodied one type of film, this tries to cover everything from Frankenstein's Monster to the Worm ..."
98,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,4 November 2005,"Lots of fun, well done; maybe just a bit long for kids","Wallace & Gromit films are always fun, and this outing-- their first full-length feature-- is extremely well done. Lots of puns and jokes for older folks and delightful imagery for the younger set. Kids under 4 might not get all that much out of it, but hey-- you can't appeal to everyone.My only complaint is that this movie seemed to run a bit long. It's a bit long to hold small children's attention but, more importantly, it's a bit long to be stretching the otherwise very cute subject matter. Even Bugs Bunny can get a little bit labored in a full-length movie about a single subject; it's just the nature of the genre.Still, that's a small complaint. Overall I applaud the creators' ingenuity, humor and dynamism and hope for many more Wallace & Gromit venues!"
99,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,26 October 2005,The best animated film ever,"This was the first film I'd actually been to the cinema to see since Master and Commander, as I'm a big fan of animation anyway. There's something truly endearing about these two characters. Like getting home after work, slipping on a comfy pair of slippers and tuning into to your favourite programme with a refreshing sup on the hot, brown liquid stuff. As in the other shorts it's Gromit the ever faithful mute dog that steals the film from the gormless but lovable Wallace. How Park and co. get to convey such emotions from him never fails to amaze me. You can easily see why it took them five years to produce, as ever stop motion gem is faultless, except for the odd missed thumb print on the character's heads. The script is well conceived and the sight gags are genius. This is a film that will delight both young and old audiences alike. A hearty recommendation. Can't wait for the DVD."
100,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,21 September 2005,Aardman does it again,"With each feature Nick Park's team get a little more ambitious and develop the characters further. Wallace grows more into the clueless inventor-geek while Gromit saves the day with nous, bravery and luck. Aardman also has fun with some Bugs Bunny and Looneytunes spoofing in general.If I had a quibble, it was that this was a little loose in the editing - but then it is immensely enjoyable and deftly hosts jokes that work on all sorts of levels to keep non-juveniles chuckling as well as those of more tender years. Instead of dreading taking your kids to school holiday flicks you can look forward to this one.The tweenies in the cinema looked at us quizically when we belly-laughed at some scenes - but there's some homage to the pioneering and slightly imperfect stop-start-stop-go animation in the original 1933 King Kong, and lip service to many classic Hammer horror films like Curse of the Werewolf, and various other creep-flicks.The subplot lines work well - Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter provide suitably plummy accents without making you even think of them, which is the way celebrity character voicings should be. It's not quite the perfection of 'The Wrong Trousers' but it is a worthy standard-bearer."
101,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,22 October 2005,Enjoyable,"Wallace & Gromit's full-length feature film (the Curse of the Were-Rabbit), is an enjoyable tale for the whole family. Children will continue to be amazed at the action and overall silliness of the film while adults will enjoy some of the higher level of jokes and the innocence.The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a little better than average, but Chicken Run and the Wallace and Gromit shorts were more enjoyable. Still, this is a good movie and it is one that should be seen if you're planning on going to the cinema (or, if it has been released on video when you read this, renting it). The reason why I preferred the other Aardman productions was down to quality of story. Maybe I expected too much because this film has been in production for so long. I cannot fault the overall technique or animation; I think this is done very well, and it is good to see that they're making films like this rather than computer animation. It's much better because they do not over-do it and it doesn't look computer-animated. Well done; they deserve an Oscar for animation."
102,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,19 October 2005,It was always going to happen one day,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Some years after their last TV outing, Wallace & Gromit, everyone's favourite plasticine heroes, are now running their own pest control business. Together, they must battle living threats to farmers crops, mainly in the shape of pesky rabbits, using Wallace's various contraptions. One such invention he's just developed is a mind-control machine that will rid rabbits of the desire to do bad things (namely eat crops.) But it all goes drastically wrong, and when the town comes under attack from the Were-Rabbit, the mother of all rabbits, it becomes clear that something very dubious is at work.Five years ago, with my Chicken Run review, I said it would have 'been better if they'd made a Wallace & Gromit film instead.' And, five years later, it looks as though that wish has come true with this effort that's popped up pretty much out of nowhere.Although there weren't that many W/G TV shorts, they were popular enough so that someone was bound to make a feature film of them one day. And that day has finally arrived. But unfortunately, here is one of those occasions where what worked as a TV show hasn't translated that brilliantly to a feature film. Although adequately enough.It's a fairly charming film, even a little funny in parts, with the familiar plasticine two-some back to their Yorkshire roots, as well as a neat supporting cast in the shape of Ralph Fiennes as the villain, Peter Kay (!) as a traditional Yorkshire PC and Helena Bonham Carter as a seductive posh bird, providing a love interest for Wallace that threatens to spoil the bond between man and dog. But stretching out as a feature film, it just doesn't quite have the same impact as the marvellous TV shorts did all those years ago. For something that was bound to happen, though, a pretty good effort and something of a welcome change from all the violence and vile language used to entertain in recent British films. ***"
103,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,8 October 2005,This film does not disappoint,"First, the single shortfall. Wallace and Grommit work better on TV. For Chicken Run they used clever techniques which allow claymation to make a highly effective transition onto the big screen; but for Wallace and Grommit a technology make-over would've simply been wrong, wrong, wrong.So, if you can live with this minor shortfall, the rest of the news is all good. The story? Pure Wallace and Grommit. The characters? The stereotypical English eccentrics have all turned out in force. The pace? Perfection.This film pays homage to some classic horror stories, but don't be swayed against taking your youngest kids along - this is pure family entertainment at its finest. I left the theater feeling agreeably satisfied, and I hope you do too. Perhaps it lacks the whiz-bang appeal of The Incredibles but the pure britishness of this film is a glory unto itself. Thanks to everyone who pored their hearts into making this mini-epic."
104,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,27 October 2005,not as good as shorts,"The Curse of the Were-Rabbit was pretty good, except it lacked the traditional dry British humor of the shorts.The animation was top-notch, with only a few digital effects. The voices were well done, and for clay, there was quite a bit of character expression. I liked Chicken Run better, but this was pretty good. The shorts were funnier, and had slightly better dialog. The plot was okay, but a little too goofy. I did not like the disrespect for the vicar, but only a small nit-pick. It was a little too violent and too much suggestive content for a G-rated movie.Overall, 7/10"
105,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,25 October 2005,"worth it for the claymation, story is a little long","This movie is worth seeing mostly for the brilliant claymation, which, in the present day computer dominated world of animation, is refreshingly old school. No doubt there is some usage of computers, but for the most part it's good old painstaking frame by frame manipulation of figurines. I can't imagine the amount of work involved in making a 90 minute feature film in claymation, and for that and the brilliant techniques I applaud this film.The film is the third (fourth?) installment of the lovable Wallace and Grommit characters. The first few minutes will have you chuckling at the buck toothed British stereotypes, but after a while the chuckles fade slightly. There are no outright side splitting moments, but a lot of cutesy jokes. The story is pretty well told but i find W & G work better as a short film subject, there's only so many times you can laugh by seeing people with goofy faces smile."
106,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,9 November 2017,Another cracking adventure from Britain's favourite claymation dog and his companion.,"One of Britain's most recognisable duos, the claymation Wallace and Gromit (who's other appearances are all cracking adventures too, I might add), bring their home-spun and wholesome humour to the big- screen in a big way with what I can honestly say is one of the funniest films I have had the pleasure of watching, one that is carefully crafted to be a charming and entertaining experience that is almost impossible to fault mainly because there is not a single moment that seems out of place - not to mention the fact that the flick keeps a huge smile on your face throughout; of course it is also beautifully animated and holds a hugely tactile aesthetic that makes each frame feel both grounded and alive, but the piece also places an emphasis on its smartly written screenplay and several nuanced sight-gags to elevate what some could consider simple 'kids- material' into something that can be enjoyed by an extremely wide audience, while its story and visuals also include a couple of nice call-backs to horror movies past which cement the picture as a very cine-literate one that knows its place and relishes it. 8/10"
107,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,24 October 2017,"""I never saw such cauliflower carnage!""","What I like about animated films is how film makers insert subtle adult humor that generally sail over kids' heads, the way the old Warner Brothers cartoons used to do with their characters. This one had Lady Totty showing off her melons to Wallace and the Pansy Spray used on Victor was another subtle but humorous touch. Otherwise I'm not what you'd consider an animated film fan, but I'll take one in every now and then, even if I'm way behind the curve by a decade or more like this one. It had it's humorous moments, with nods to other films scattered throughout; the King Kong reference was the most obvious one for this viewer. Even though the title implied a scary character, it didn't appear to be child unfriendly, and I'd say it was fairly entertaining for kids of all ages."
108,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,15 November 2016,Hippity Hoppity Woo --hhhhat the!,"This mediocre film was an alright watch. It definitely wasn't the best. It was super corny, even for a children's animation film. I liked the dorky type story-line though. It may be lame, but at least it was original. I watched it, wand the last reaction I had was ""what the..."" I've seen some goofy stuff, but a were-bunny? That's funny. However, as much as I say it's corky or lame, it was definitely a cute show. They have this ""Anti-Pesto"" team made up of a dog and a guy who eliminate garden pests in a town where they hold vegetables as a high value. Everyone grows vegetables to compete in a vegetable festival every year. So... you guessed it, ""Anti-Pesto is challenged with this were-rabbit situation in the most peculiar way. They try to reach this were-rabbit before this animal killing hunter tries to land the prize trophy for himself. ""Anti-Pesto"" offers bunnies sanctuary. Think they can pull it off? I think you'll be surprised on how they go about it.The animation is kind of predictable. However, it's a fun watch for a family film. It's got dorky humor that will give your little ones a laugh or two . I didn't mind this film at all, except for the bald people. It's like their foreheads are molded into eyebrows. It's hard to explain. I think it's a very enjoyable family film."
109,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,7 April 2015,Good entertainment,"Good entertainment.Charming animated movie, one of the many in the Wallace and Gromit series of movies and TV episodes. Sweet story, with good action and great animation. In a world where good CGI is a given, thanks to technological advances, the animation in Wallace and Gromit movies and TV episodes is brilliant and second-to-none.Good voice castings, with Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes joining Peter Sallis (Wallace).Good fun, ideal for the whole family."
110,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,5,27 January 2015,Wallace and Gromit against all...,"""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is an Animation movie in which we watch Wallace and his loyal dog, Gromit who are trying to solve the mystery of garden sabotage which threatens the annual giant vegetable growing contest. Also we observe Wallace and Victor Quartermaine fight for the love of Lady Campanula Tottington.I liked this movie because it's a different kind of Animation movies that we watch nowadays and the plot of it's really good. Also about the cast it has to be mentioned that Peter Sallis (Wallace and Hutch) and Ralph Fiennes (Victor Quartermaine) voices were really one of the best selections for this movie characters and I believe that they really fit on them. Also the voice of Helena Bonham Carter who ""played"" as Lady Campanula Tottington was equally good selection.Finally I have to say that ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is a must see movie for Animation fans and I believe that from this movie we can gain many things."
111,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,14 January 2015,Good Stuff,"Wallace and his loyal dog, Gromit, set out to discover the mystery behind the garden sabotage that plagues their village and threatens the annual giant vegetable growing contest.This is a film that is both good and bad. Fans of Wallace, Gromit and Nick Park will probably enjoy it. The time and effort that goes into this kind of animation is unbelievable. Is it harder than hand-drawing? Maybe, maybe not... but everything has to be just right, which makes it seem like more of a process than the computer animation of today (2015).But the story is not that great, or at least not as memorable. Today, ""Wrong Trousers"" and ""Chicken Run"" are something of modern classics, but ""Were Rabbit"" has been more or less forgotten. A huge splash in 2005-2006, perhaps, but only decreasing in popularity since. Unfortunate, really, given the great voice talent (Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes) involved."
112,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,14 September 2013,Family film for everyone,"Wallace and Gromit are back. This time they are in pest control. The big pest they are taking care of it in this vegetable obsessed town is rabbit. The two friends in their humane pest-control outfit ""Anti-Pesto"" have one big problem. What to do with all the rabbits? Using a mind transfer contraption, Wallace hope to brainwash the rabbits to not eat vegetables. Instead he creates something much much worst.The story is quite fun and watchable. You don't have to be a fan to like this. The jokes work very well. That's quite a few big laughs. It still has the same sense of humor as before. This is truly a family film for everyone."
113,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,19 July 2013,Timeless Clay,"There is something nostalgic about a Nick Park Wallace and Gromit piece. There's never any indication of a specific time span in the films, though there does seem to be slight indications of a narrative flow and an overall sense of travel, but nowhere do we find the sort of thing that one sees with the Simpsons (nobody in the Simpsons ages, though they do seem to move through time periods; but Bart in the early 90s was a kid and 20 years later, he's still a kid, while the family can look back and remember when he wasn't born). Wallace and Gromit can look back too, and perhaps if there was more to their story, we'd also notice they never age... however, their world is placed in a timeless place that echoes the 50s and 60s. Nobody has a computer. Wallace builds a rocket in the short 'A Grand Day Out', but either he missed Neil Armstrong proving once and for all that the moon isn't made of cheese, or that grand worldwide event has yet to happen in his world. Animation has the ability to be timeless, yet it has to relate to us in a way that makes us comfortable. Wallace and Gromit inhabit that rare place of nostalgia. Their adventures are new, but there's a quaintness to them, like sipping hot chocolate and hearing wild yet tamed down stories of the adventures your grandparents used to have. The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is exemplary for providing us just such a tale. It's cheeky in places if you're old enough to get the jokes, but never offensive. It presents modern ideas (vegetarianism, humane treatment of animals), that doesn't share much of a place with the time period it hearkens back to, but is subtle enough that many years from now, we won't feel off put by it. It's a safe, pleasant, quite-often-hilarious tale that we'll want to return to... watching this movie is basically like hugging your favorite pet dog. Of course, your dog is probably less inclined to wake you up in the morning the same way Gromit is."
114,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,21 June 2013,It's Cracking!!,"To the people who are saying 'This has no plot' chances are your just too stupid to understand a good story line. There is plot and the claymation is remarkably good. There is so much detail on the buildings and town. There are good laughs too, I bet the people who said they don't get laughter is obviously an American who doesn't get British humour, no offense to the people who do. Yes there are some sexual innuendos but they are for the adults. Many shows like 'The Animanics' and the 'Rugrats' and even 'Cat In The Hat', despite it been so terribly done, have some innuendos in them and people who grew up with the show love it now as an adult. These types of jokes are for the adults as the creators know there'll be adults taking their kids to see this movie. Kids won't even understand the joke, but if they do tell them when they're or if they consider it understanding it themselves. I enjoy the movie, I understand the British humour this movie has like the 1-hour long specials. Most people might think the villain is not as great as the ones in the shorts. They see him more as a pompous person who's after a woman's money. But isn't Gaston from 'Beauty and The Beast' like that as well? Pompous? The film had done a great tribute to other classic films like 'King Kong' and 'The Curse of the Werewolf' and that is another thing with people saying they don't like this movie, 'Why can't there be a werewolf?' That would make the movie bad, why would there be a vegetable competition and a werewolf involve? That doesn't make any sense! A Were-Rabbit is good for comedy as they do vegetables such as carrots.I'm not against everyone's opinions here, but if you don't understand what the movie is about and hate it because of a villain or the use of a 'Were-Rabbit' instead of Wolf or its British humour but without any proper explainable reason why, then I'm not going to take your opinions seriously.The movie is great and it deserves the award back in 2006 for its outstanding animation and comedic storyline. I like the shorts and this movie and I do hope one day they make another Wallace and Gromit movie."
115,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,19 June 2013,hare-um scare-um,"I've liked every Wallace & Gromit movie that I've seen and ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" adds to that. It depicts the crackpot inventor and his silent but calculating dog running a rabbit-busting business leading up to a vegetable competition, when a giant rabbit starts terrorizing the town. Like the other movies, it contains a litany of pop culture references (""Carrot on a Hot Tin Roof"" and ""Fromage to Eternity"") with a really clever plot. One of the best things about Nick Park's movies - in addition to their clever plots - is that they aren't excuses to sell a bunch of products. But mostly it was fun seeing all the in-jokes. Like the old Looney Tunes cartoons, it's a mixture of youthful ebullience and mental maturity. You're sure to love it."
116,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,19 February 2013,"Watch-able, over and over","Rarely do I give a film 10/10, but this one does make my cut. I loved the characters' accents, the facial expressions on Gromit, the small village type behaviour of the townsfolk, how funny Lady Tottingham is,...I could go on. It's great animation, a fantastic and easily understood story, motivating music, and had cute scenes of goofy bunny mayhem. It must have been a hoot making this movie, though the minute movements necessary to make the stop-animation a feature-length picture probably tested the nerves of the animators on occasion. My yound kids enjoy this movie. We've gone on to see all of the other Wallace & Gromit movies produced, but this one is the best. This movie is light and ticklish, and a great way to spend a rainy afternoon."
117,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,24 December 2012,Excellent movie,"There are a few aspects to Park's movies, and in particular Wallace & Gromit, that I would say make them so great. The first is subtlety and observation, the flagship of which is the character of Gromit. He doesn't speak, he doesn't make any noise, all he has are his eyes, brow, and body posture, and with these he commands the film. Park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression. The comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the subtlest of movements and it works superbly well. In a nutshell, it's a great movie. They kept the animation style of Chicken Run, which was another great movie. A total fun."
118,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,27 August 2012,Great comic fun!...,"Filmed in stop-motion, it is brilliantly animated with a really marvellous plot and the usual great musical themes that all Wallace & Gromit films have. All the performances were great; You couldn't have a Wallace and Gromit film without the marvellous voice of Peter Sallis as Wallace (and Hutch in this one). Ralph Fiennes supplies the voice of the slippery Victor Quartermaine and Helena Bonham Carter is great as Lady Campanula Tottington. Also worthy of note were; Peter Kay as PC Mackintosh, Nicholas Smith had some of the best lines (IMO) as the Reverend Clement Hedges, Liz Smith as Mrs. Mulch, John Thomson as Mr. Windfall, Mark Gatiss as Miss Blight and Geraldine McEwan as Miss Thripp.Full of subtle little jokes, but also at its heart a great plot that keeps the audience guessing. I must admit I really enjoyed this one; for me it had everything I would look for in a comedy; characters you actually care about, a plot, some really funny sight gags and a lot of more subtle comedy besides. I should also mention the quality of the performances as well; the comic timing was impeccable. Over all, probably the best comic film I've seen in a very long time Well worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My Score: 8.8/10IMDb Score: 7.7/10 (based on 57,298 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 87/100: (Based on 38 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 95/100 (based on 173 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 72/100 'Liked it' (based on 360,968 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
119,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,17 June 2012,Wallace and gromit go to Hollywood,"In a world where CGI is taking over with some stupid movie that try to be the next Pixar and immediately fail. I was beyond excited when I heard of a feature length but then I seen the trailer and got disappointed. I had nothing to do one day so I thought to waste some time by seeing the film in cinemas and boy did I love this filmIt's the most epic in my opinion and the best voice acting. With a close shave and a matter of loaf and death (I know this was before) I easily knew what would happen but with this I was shocked the monster was Wallace! I was thinking after this scene "" Yes, this is a great idea!"" The best claymation and over-all looking of well... Ever I guess or at least the best of Wallace and gromit. The score is fantastic, the humour is not only pee in your pants great but the timing is top notch! The new human people are really funny and even kenny from south park makes a cameo when everybody panics at the fair and faints.I recommend this to any fan of the shorts, I could speak a lot more like the climax music and climax overall or the new voice actors but I'm watching the film right now with some cheese!"
120,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,11 February 2012,COool!,"When Wallace and Gromit burst onto the scene in their academy award winning short, ""A Grand Day Out,"" they created a fresh new look at claymation. After two more shorts, Aardman's dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. It has an excellent Voice cast, humorous jokes and good animation as only Aardman could do! In this movie, Wallace and Gromit run ""Anti-Pesto,"" a rabbit removal company. When word gets out about a ""Were-Rabbit"" eating all the vegetables in town, a frenzy ensues. Of course, Victor Quartermaine, the town's handsome, toupee-brandishing huntsman, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely Lady Tottington...but can our favorite Aardman duo save the day before chaos ensues? The jokes, I should say, were hilarious. One point, the villain, Victor Quartermaine's, booty-crack was showing, prompting a character to cry out: ""BEWARE...THE MOON!!!"" Vintage Aardman! The characters are crisp and hilarious. Our favorite Aardman team of Man and Dog entertains us as only they could do, earning them their second Oscar (remember ""A Grand Day Out?""). Helena Bonham Carter was terrific as the lovely Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning, toupee wearing hunter Victor Quartermaine. But the one who really stole the show was the priest, whose antics proved to be some hilarious comic relief.Hats off to Aardman for creating another Wallace and Gromit masterpiece!"
121,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,5 September 2010,Gromit on the big screen,British institutions Wallace and Gromit make their big screen debut in this funny and charming film.Full of all the heart and humour that made the characters and the original short films so popular this big screen adventure captures everything that made Wallace and Gromit so popular with the wit and in jokes that have become linked with the series coming thick and fast.By adding nice new characters and more plot depth the film manages to move on at a fast pace carrying the audience along on our dynamic duos latest adventure.Overall a fun family film that can be enjoyed by all.
122,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,2 September 2010,Crackers about Wallace & Gromit!,"What can I say about the Were-Rabbit than it was absolutely fabulous! There's not a single area I could zone in on that can be negatively criticized. For, it was enormously funny  Gromit always cracks me up and his mute but loud expressions always have me rolling, it was adventurous, inventive, had a great soundtrack and score and is simply great for the whole family. Not to mention the climax just goes on and on  and that's a good thing. You can't help but laugh and roll with the excitement simultaneously admiring the genius on what they did with what was around.Wallace runs a anti-pest type company that the entire community relies on and on the side he craves cheese and inventions. Luckily for him, his faithful and thoroughly superior pet/friend, Gromit, keeps him in check for the most part.With an outbreak of rabbits  hilariously portrayed by poor overworked Gromit, who humanely takes care of the captured ""pests""  Wallace decides on de-veggie the rabbits. In an experiment gone wrong, a mutant rabbit now stalks the street.Further, the town is terrorize much like the days of old werewolf movies, but in this case a gigantic rabbit beast that Wallace & Gromit try to capture to both save the city and their name. Meanwhile, Wallace is in pursuit of Lady Campanula Tottington who's also wooed by the sinister Victor Quartermaine.Will they stop the Were-Rabbit and save the day? Spoiler Alert! It's a G-rated cartoon.I don't want to go as far as to say you have to be a Wallace & Gromit or British humor fan, so I will say, regardless, this movie is excellent. There is absolutely no harm in taking a viewing to one of the most inventive movies I have ever seen. Especially with what happens in the background. SEE IT!"
123,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,3 January 2009,Lovably Daft Animated Antics Of Crime Fighting Vegetable Protectors,"Trouble is brewing in the country village of Tottington, just ahead of the annual prize vegetable fair. Pesky, greenery eating rabbits are on the loose, and it's up to vegetable security firm Pesto (a.k.a. Wallace and Gromit) to safeguard the competition entries This movie, featuring Park's lovable duo of gormless inventor Wallace and his faithful beagle Gromit, is a fun, beautifully made big-screen adventure for his plasticine heroes. It borrows a few elements from the previous short films (Wallace's crazy wake up devices, strange goings-on in the duo's cellar) but is a fresh and different story, a strange mix of old-time horror movie and mansion house mystery, but shot through with hilarious comic bunglings and destruction. It's lovely to see a film which is pretty much all traditional stop motion animation (albeit with some digital effects mixed in), and to see how far the talented artists at Aardman Animations have pushed the medium, with amazing camera moves, depth of focus and production design unheard of in the children's TV shows this style of material usually graces. Park's genius is to somehow be able to take classic film grammar and recreate it for clay figures, but also to tell great stories full of warmth and humour - sequences like the one where Gromit follows the giant footsteps upstairs and uncovers the terrible truth are simply fantastic. I wasn't quite as impressed by this movie as the second and third short films (The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave), but all of the key talents from them are here; Sallis' wonderful voice, Julian Nott's fabulous brass music, cameraman Tristan Oliver and producer Peter Lord. You'd have to be a real sour puss to start with not to like a movie with the word were-rabbit in the title, but this is terrific comedy entertainment all the way. I really enjoy the credits in this film, where Sallis (the eleventh male lead in Hammer's Curse Of The Werewolf) is billed first, before such minor players as Fiennes and Bonham Carter. Reet grand."
124,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,30 December 2008,Wallace and Gromit arrive on the big screen...,"Wallace and Gromit are iconic British TV heroes who entertain a whole nation during Christmas with there adventures. In the curse of the were rabbit, Wallace turns into a giant rabbit that eats up all the residents veg's....And a local named Victor vows to bring this creature down....Its up to Gromit to save the day....The film is hilarious with great dialogue and brilliant animation that keeps you watching, its amazing that this is still done by stop animation. I loved the little gags like 'contains nuts', the cabbage around the breasts.Wallace and Gromit truly live up to their hype...."
125,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,22 December 2008,Wonderful,"Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005, Dir. Steve Box, Nick Park) Wallace (Sallis) and his dog, Gromit has built up a very respectable business which prevents any pests from destructing the vegetables of the village, but when a creature, only described as the were-rabbit, rampages through the village, all eyes are on Wallace. After hearing his plan, the villagers are on his side, expect one man. Victor Quartermaine (Fiennes) feels threatened by Wallace's relationship with his fiancée Lady Campanula Tottington (Bonham Carter), and aims to take out the bunny himself.With three successful shorts under the Wallace & Gromit name, all eyes was on whether a full length feature can be as successful. Were-Rabbit ends up more than an extended short. Everything loved in the shorts are tripled here with nothing missing. The story is wonderful and the cast make it work without any problems.Ho-ho! Very classy.  Wallace (Peter Sallis)"
126,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,15 December 2008,"Cracking Film, Gromit!","Man, this movie was funny! I'm mean every scene was priceless. The plot always make me laugh 'cause of the villagers are made to look like morons. They are obsessed with their vegetables. I also loved the Were-Rabbit and Hutch. I just hope Peter Sallis does Wallace for a few more years. I know he is eighty-seven now and now getting any younger but it's a delight to hear his voice time and time again. And the bits when Philip got out his little purse made the cinema roar with laughter. And rightly so! This movie just show you that Wallace and Gromit are the jewel in recent British Animation. Can't wait for a Matter of Loaf and Death this Christmas. It's gonna be good. Long Live Wallace and Gromit! P.S. Rest in Peace, Kathy Staff (Nora Batty). British TV will not be the same without you!"
127,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,30 November 2008,Hare-larious!,"The Wallace & Gromit shorts from Aardman Animations are muchly loved. The adventures of a scatterbrained inventor and his much smarter dog have found a rich and varied audience. Every one of their films has been a sheer delight, both in writing and quality animation. The Wrong Trousers is the finest 30 minutes of screen time Wallace & Gromit have ever committed to celluloid. After their third film, the two characters fell silent for five years, before creator Nick Park announced in 2000 they would next be arriving on the big screen.It took a further five years to complete the film, Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. I wasn't sure to begin with if Wallace & Gromit would work as well if stretched to feature-length, but I needn't have worried. This is a marvellous entertainment. Confident. Supremely funny. And the different medium has allowed for a much more ambitious story. But most importantly, despite being produced by DreamWorks, all the quirky, British eccentricities of the shorts are gloriously intact.Wallace & Gromit have tried their hands at ship building, window cleaning, and now they're into pest control. Their village has a serious rabbit problem. And with the Annual Vegetable Competition only days away, W&G have become bunny hunters. Forming Anti-Pesto, they deal in humane ways of getting rid of rabbits. The business is a success. And Wallace catches the eye of upper-class Lady Tottington (should have been Toffington). But things turn sour when a mysterious giant rabbit starts terrorising the town. Wallace & Gromit swing into action. But things are not what they seem.The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the most entertaining family films I've seen in quite some time. From the moment we hear the familiar theme music, the film sets in with a breakneck pace that never flags for a second. Packed with wall to wall gags, hilarious inventions and more rabbit jokes than one can shake a (carrot) stick at, the film is one wacky, wild roller-coaster of a ride.Its hard to tell where to start describing the film. I don't really want to spoil the visual invention on display. Because its so cleverly done. Like Wallace & Gromit suiting up. Its a sequence seemingly modelled and intended as a cross between Thunderbirds and Ghostbusters. I especially loved the garden pond swivelling over to form a driveway. Wallace's different rabbit traps are really sublime. There's always been a delirious nuttiness to the Wallace & Gromit shorts, but in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, that nuttiness becomes positively madcap.The Rabbit-Van (that's what I've decided to call it!) is as just as animated as any of its co-stars. Not only does it have a built-in lasso for catching runaway bunnies, but its most appealing feature is if necessary, it can shake itself off like a dog! The Aardmans' imaginations have really gone wild. But more crucial to the film's success is a plot. And the Aardmans' have ensured that there is an actual story going on, despite how wacky the film may get.The whole mystery of the Were-Rabbit is quite well written on the Aardmans part, full of misdirections and gentle reversals of ones expectations. I don't want to reveal any more because I think one of the film's greatest pleasures is the identity of the Were-Rabbit. For anyone who hasn't seen the film, to know who it is just by reading about it takes some of the fun out of the film. And robs it of some of its surprises too.It was Nick Park's insistence that Peter Sallis return to voice Wallace. DreamWorks wanted someone more well known. I'm glad he stayed firm on that, because Peter Sallis is Wallace. He knows him inside out. A novice to the role would have been detrimental to the film. They wouldn't bring the same insight that Sallis has into the character. They might have made Wallace too goofy, but Sallis brings the right blend of warmth and dimwittedness that makes Wallace so endearing.But as always its the wonderful Gromit that steals the show. Gromit really is one of the animated world's most inspired creations. He doesn't have a mouth, so he can't talk. All he has to rely upon is body language and a very expressive brow. All he has to do is raise his eyes into the air, and you know what he's thinking. Forever having to clean up the messes Wallace makes (when it should be the other way around!), the long-suffering hound goes far, above and beyond the call of duty in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.The ending feels like a blend between Frankenstein and King Kong. And some of the action scenes put several Hollywood blockbusters to shame. The film even finds time to be poignant when for a moment, we actually think Wallace may have died. Its heart-stopping. Gromit's relief that he hasn't is lovely, and their hug is touching. Even at feature-length, the film only clocks in at 80 minutes. 75 if you don't count the end credits. If it had gone on much longer, the inventive puns might have become wearying. This way, it doesn't wear out its welcome. The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is truly original. Its set to become a time-honoured classic. And the rabbits are hilarious. Have I mentioned that?By the way. Make sure you stay all the way through to the end credits. When the disclaimer ""No animals were harmed during the making of this picture"" comes up, it'll be the funniest thing you've seen in a film in years."
128,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,1 October 2008,Cracking good family fun,"As the annual vegetable competition draws nearer, Wallace and Gromit are in charge of protecting the town's vegetables, but a vegetable monster is causing havoc for the famous British animated characters.Audiences were treated with some wonderful animated shorts involving a barmy inventor and his faithful companion in half an hour adventures, and then after 5 years in the making, we were treated to a visually stunning, fun and clever film.The animation and visual effects are as wonderful as you could hope for, even outclassing a number of Pixar films, and those 5 years weren't wasted as Wallace and Gromit won an Oscar for Best Animated film.The plot and humour, though not perfect, are thoroughly enjoyable and contribute largely to the overall feel good entertaining factor, which makes a wonderful family film. The physical comedy and the ""cracking"" catchphrases are all perfect fun. Though funny, the comic technique is repetitive which can be slightly annoying if you don't like that particular style.The whole narrative is amusing as Wallace and Gromit are again a great leading duo and carry the plot with their dialogue and comedy. Their relationship has developed into a heart warming portrayal of loyalty and love and is hard to imagine one without the other. Gromit is perhaps more funny in the film, but Wallace is more interesting to watch.There are plenty of jokes to amuse the younger generations but watch out for a couple of adult jokes which will stay in your memory long after you've finished watching.As with the animated shorts, there is mystery and a great sense of excitement behind the plot which will keep you hooked right to the dramatic and thrilling climax.After a couple of views the film starts to wear off, and flaws can start appearing.Nevertheless, it is still funny and has plenty of quality to entertain and dazzle the family."
129,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,16 September 2008,"An unforgettable stop-motion animated feature, not aimed at any specific age group","After a ten-year hiatus for Aardman Animations' Wallace & Gromit characters, they finally reappeared, this time in their own full-length movie, which had never happened before. By the time I first saw this highly acclaimed stop-motion animated feature, I had seen Aardman's ""Chicken Run"", a full-length movie they did in between the last Wallace & Gromit short and ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"", and was impressed, but I hadn't seen any of the Wallace & Gromit shorts. Nonetheless, this effort still didn't disappoint me, and I think I liked it better than Aardman Animations' 2000 release. Since then, I have seen W & G shorts, and would say that this 2005 film showed that the characters hadn't lost it! Dimwitted but well-meaning inventor Wallace and his smart but silent dog, Gromit, run their own business called ""Anti-Pesto"", providing service for the neighbourhood by capturing garden pests. The annual Giant Vegetable Competition is only days away, and Wallace and Gromit find themselves having to capture a lot of rabbits from the gardens of their customers in order to keep the competition out of jeopardy. With their basement getting crowded with rabbits, Wallace tries his recent invention, the ""Mind-Manipulation-O-Matic"" machine, to try and brainwash the rabbits, so they can be released and no longer be a threat to the neighbourhood gardens! This experiment seems to work, but soon after Wallace and Gromit try it, a giant beastly rabbit begins to appear at night, ravaging gardens all over the neighbourhood, and obviously threatening the upcoming vegetable competition! The first thing I'll mention about this film is the humour. I've seen the movie three times now, and it had never failed to make me laugh. Wallace and Gromit are both funny in different ways; Wallace with his clueless nature, antics, and funny lines, and Gromit, while he doesn't talk, he communicates with his body language and facial expressions, which are often good for laughs. Other aspects of the film that add to the humour include the rabbits, especially Hutch, who eventually starts acting like Wallace after the brainwashing, and sometimes certain other neighbourhood residents. The humour isn't the only merit of ""Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". It also has some suspenseful moments, especially the ones involving the were-rabbit, as well as some seriously heartfelt scenes. The plot is pretty simple, but that's not always a bad thing, and in a movie like this, it works.It takes a lot of time and effort for Aardman Animations to make these stop-motion animated pieces, but their hard work tends to pay off! This successful 2005 motion picture of theirs is a nice, lighthearted one with things to delight all ages with! Movies from recent years like this one prove that although CGI animation tends to be more common these days, stop-motion animation is still going strong, and hasn't been wiped out by CGI animation. So, regardless of you age, if you like the kind of animation used for this film (I have no complaints about the quality of the animation, that's for sure), as well as wit, slapstick, and a lighthearted story, ""Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is probably a film for you, and one you won't likely forget soon after watching!"
130,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,24 May 2008,Great Family Entertainment,"I have always been a fan of Wallace and Gromit and I was so happy when I heard that a feature film was being made. I loved the BBC programs that were made and Chicken Run was also a very entertaining film. In the film Wallace and Gromit have gone into the pest control business and humanely. The town is about to have their annual Vegetable contest and everyone in the village is covered by their company. However, Wallace and Gromit is unable to deal with the growing number of rabbits they end up having to care for so try and brainwash them. However a Wererabbit is created and its up to the heroes to capture it before Victor Quatermaine (Ralph Fiennes) is able to kill it. At the same time Wallace is trying to woo Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham-Carter).Wallace and Gromit has a fanbase, especially in the UK and this film was praised by most critics. It has the best silent performances you will see from a modern film. It is friendly for the kids but has plenty for adults as well. It has homages to horror films, mainly werewolf films and does play on that fact. It does also have fun little easter eggs as well, such as the priest and the nun wrestling magazine. This film is very British which I enjoyed and has a nice old-fashioned felt to it which I liked. I really like the fact that Nick Park ignored what the Americans advised him to do. It is just the right length for children, but it should be noted that spot motion animation does take a long time to make. The film keeps Peter Sallis as the voice of Wallace, and has two great British actors as the supporting stars. There are also other British performers in the film such as Peter Kay (who I normally find annoying), but like in this film. It does what Pixar films do and focus on the story and try not to get big stars in the film. Finally the film is beautifully animated, having great models and good sets. The film is very detailed on that front.Wallace and Gromit is a great film for adults and children."
131,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,1 April 2008,"The cheese crazy inventor, back for good","A quest to free mankind from the rabbit problem forever, thats what old pals Wallace and Grombit are on this time. And thats when they face the monstrous were-rabbit, which too is on a quest. A quest to eat all the vegetables of the town and that too, on the verge of the famous vegetable competition of the Tottington hall.Well, Aardam studios have pulled off this difficult script really well. The cheese-crazy inventor Wallace and his canine pal Grombit have been the best bets for this studio for long. But, casting them in a feature film at a time when the term ""animation film"" has become synonymous with words bigger and better, was really tough. A good script, great clay animation and some special effects make this film an interesting package over-all. In brief, Wallace and Grombit are called by Lady Tottington, to solve a major rabbit problem in her estate. The humane ways of anti-pesto are liked by her, but not by her lover, Victor, who happens to be a hunter. Wallace, who starts to like the Lady, decides to solve the problem by brainwashing the rabbits. But seen they are confronted by a gigantic rabbit. With the aim to capture it, Wallace and Grombit start-off, but not without Wallace's love rival Victor on their tails. It is a twisty mystery from here-on, with the humane duo saving the show in the in the end.Over-all, an interesting movie with a nice story."
132,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,12 March 2008,terrific in every way,"this movie was a delight from start to finish.if you're not familiar with Wallace and Gromit,Wallace is a cheese loving inventor,and Gromit is his faithful canine companion.as the title suggests the duo get heavily involved in a mystery involving a strange creature known as the Were-Rabbit,and hijinks ensue.the entire movie is filmed using characters molded from plasticine,and using stop motion animation.a lot of painstaking work went into the process,and it shows.the detail is amazing.and beyond that,the movie is funny and suitable for all ages.i loved this movie and will definitely be watching it again.for a fun time for the whole family,i recommend this movie heartily.for me,Wallace and Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a perfect 10/10"
133,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,22 February 2008,"It lacks slight charm of the original three, but overall this is a cracking good film!","There was something about the original three films that made them so special and delightful - probably the length of them. Unfortunately this lacks the charm, but it still ends up being a fun film. The bright, shimmering side is that our favourite plasticene figures are still doing a cracking great job, there is good plasticene animation used, there is a silly, but well-structured and entertaining plot, an exciting, fun adventure, a good plot idea (a were-rabbit and a giant vedgetable competition) and good new characters!As well as lacking the original charm, the only other slightly gloomy side of the film is that the humour, though good, is slightly overdone, especially compared to the original films.The popular Giant Vedgetable Competition is drawing near and Wallace and Gromit are helping control rabbits from eating any vedgetables, now they are Anti Pesto. They are doing a good job, but soon, there is danger afoot. A were-rabbit is nearby...Recommended to all Wallace and Gromit fans and to people who like plasticene films, enjoy ""Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Wererabbit""! :-)"
134,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,4 February 2008,"CHEEEEEEESE!  a very cute, rambunctious comedy","The folks at Aardman have done a cool, cute and wild adaptation of their short films of Wallace and Gromit to feature length, as the man and his dog, inventors who seem to have more of the intelligence (or practicality) for the latter. In this case they've invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet English village. In particular for Mrs. Tottington (or 'Totty' for those who are 'intimate'), much to the chagrin of Victor Quartermaine, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle. Wallace and Gromit seem to have success with their machine, but Wallace has a mix-up: a machine he's made to make more food suddenly criss-crosses himself with a rabbit - the curse is on! A lot of this is about as much light-hearted fun that a kid's movie could ask for, but it also tips its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick: Looney Tunes, which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville. Granted, the Aardman guys (Nick Park and Steve Box) have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material. It's never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use, even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny ""ho-ho"" not funny ""ha-ha"" side (a tired criticism but I'll say it). Curse of the Were-Rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience, in its warped story and sudden dips into exposition (the Golden Bullet story is a doozy), Park and Box and company never lose sight of glee in the material.It's fuzzy and warm-hearted and completely off-the-wall for the kids (even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets, such as the truck Wallace and Gromit drive around in), and for adults there's little barbs of funky, absurdist tones in the midst of a classic English farce. Only (and I'm probably a minority opinion here) when compared to Chicken Run it's almost a little slight a work- there's less any plot than there is a series of running gags, and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese (and horrible men with egos in their guns like the Fiennes voiced Quartermaine). But when it strikes best, it's one of the most entertaining films of 2005. It gives me a big goofy smile anytime it's on TV."
135,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,10 January 2008,"Run, Rabbit, Run","Nick Park and his team deliver another quality dose of British humour with another adventure with cheese-loving Wallace and his long-suffering pooch, Gromit (no film character, real or animated, ever possessed a forehead as expressive as Gromit's).The attention to detail is as good as we've come to expect from these films and, thankfully, when we've stopped marvelling at the model sets and the tedious and painstaking work that has gone into bringing those human-shaped lumps of clay to life, there is still an engaging and funny story to enjoy. Sadly, this is something that was sorely lacking from Park's Chicken Run, a pale imitation of what he and his team are capable of achieving.While there aren't any huge belly laughs as such, there are plenty of chuckles  especially for the more observant viewer. In fact, this is the kind of film that will reward more than a single viewing, the visual gags are that abundant Even the last line of credits, in which the producers claim no animal was harmed in the making of the film, delivers a farewell gag..."
136,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,2 October 2007,Great Fun For The Family!,"Going into this movie, I was a bit cautious. I have always been a bit iffy about claymation movies. I've always enjoyed decent animated movies, but claymation was always different to me. But this one caught me by surprise. Wallace And Gromit are extremely lovable characters, and it's a great story with jokes for all ages. There's the silly burp/fart jokes for the kids and the subtle, but over the head of young kids, jokes for us older people. Very neat claymation and while the story had holes, it kept my interest beginning to end.It's so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days, this movie was all the more refreshing. Wallace and Gromit go doing their normal thing, which is exterminating HUMANELY the buggers that ruin people's vegetable crops. But this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their humanely built traps can't even keep under tabs. Great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun. If you have not exposed yourself to Wallace And Gromit, I highly recommend this movie.The only reason I rate it a 7 and not higher is because it's still a family movie and I don't have kids. I enjoyed it, but if I had been watching it with some little rug rats and my wife, it'd be at least a 9 for sure! Give it a shot!"
137,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,11 September 2007,"Which is more entrepreneurial, Wallace or Grommit?","This scene shows how Wallace's experiment by using his brain manipulation invention goes terribly wrong, creating the ""Were Rabbit"". His desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better, therefore, created a ""Brain Manipulator"" machine. He risked his own life to help solve Tottington's pests' rabbit problem and more importantly to overcome the overcrowding of rabbits being collected and stored in his basement. Though he thought his experiment worked, however, it resulted in placing more pressure on him and Gromit to find a solution before the Annual Vegetable Competition again risking his life. Gromit, who is a silent faithful dog and a loyal helper finds himself continuously thinking of innovative ways to save his master, from his radical crazy inventions going terribly wrong. What is interesting in this movie, is trying to identify: who is more entrepreneurial, Wallace or Gromit?"
138,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,9 July 2007,Puppet masters,"If you haven't watched the movie yet, but you do like comedy, go out and buy or at least rent it! The fact it won, the animation Oscar, is not a coincidence! I haven't watched many other Wallace & Gromit movies (in fact, I think I only watched one other), but the humor is very distinctive ... and some would also say very British. In a good way of course! The story will only be an excuse for all the jokes to come, but although it's not the most elaborate one, it still works (by the way, my niece did guess see one of the big surprises coming, I didn't, Kudos to her ;o) ). I do think, that after you watch this one, you'll go out and seek the other W&G movies, that are out there. Have fun!"
139,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,18 June 2007,Hare-Raising Hilarity!,"Although it isn't half as hilarious as ""Chicken Run,"" the new Wallace and Gromit comedy ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" (*** out of ****) yields more laughs than most live action comedies. British director Nick Park, who created the Wallace and Gromit characters, and co-director Steve Box rely on the old-fashioned, stop-motion method of animation--known best as claymation--to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough side-splitting scenes about a monstrously mutant hare out to devour every vegetable in sight. Amusing as its whimsical storyline is, the heart of the hilarity lies in the imaginative way with which Park and company have painstakingly constructed characters and gags out of a brand of modeling clay called Plasticine. Basically, every shot that you see in ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" required patient souls that made minor alterations in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merge into a veritable montage of merriment. Hollywood pioneered claymation as a form of animation as far back as the silent movies of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the complicated process. Aardman Studio animators managed to crank out a mere three seconds of usable footage per day. For the record, ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" took five years to make. The lumpy looking characters, with thumb-prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions, look incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and over-biting mouths. Interestingly, Gromit emerges as the funniest character, a lovable mutt with no mouth but an expressively inexpressive face who says more than most of the talking characters.Wallace and Gromit are respectively master and pooch. As the human half of the duo, Wallace is a homily looking moron without a clue who somehow manages to construct machines that do some rather incredible things. One of the funnier scenes shows master and pooch awakened by a system of chutes, hatches, and spring-operated contraptions that dress and feed them. Meanwhile, Gromit is the animal half. The running joke is that Gromit shows more common sense than his genius of a master. As good as his ideas and inventions are, Wallace could not succeed without the loyal Gromit giving him a hand. Our heroes run a pest protection business called 'Anti-Pesto.' Essentially, they must protect every vegetable patch for miles around using an ungainly looking device called a Bun-Van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits out of their ground and into a huge glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit don't kill the critters. Instead, they keep them as pets, and Wallace experiments with an inventionMind-O-Matic--designed to convert hares into carrot-haters. This ""Frankenstein"" meets ""The Fly"" approach plunges poor Wallace into deep trouble when he swaps bits of his brain with that of a rabbit. Not long thereafter, a mysterious towering terror stalks the vegetable patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the village's 517th annual Vegetable Contest approaches.Initially, Wallace and Gromit appeared in Park's Oscar-nominated, film school project ""A Grand Day Out"" (1989). Since then Aardman has released ten other animated shorts, among them ""Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave"" (1993) and the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers"" (1995). ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" differs not only because it represents the duo's big-screen debut, but also it runs a whopping 85 minutes. The first two-thirds of ""Were-Rabbit"" contain better gags than the last third, but Park and company never miss a chance to slip in an adult joke that kids won't get but attentive grown-ups will appreciate. ""Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is hare-raising fun."
140,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,11 June 2007,Absolutely Charming,"Arising from characters previously developed in a series of much-lauded shorts, THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT is about as far from run-of-the-mill ""family fare"" as you can get: beautifully crafted and with witty dialogue and clever concepts, this really is a movie that will appeal to almost every member of the family.The story concerns Wallace and his dog Gromit, who live in a village obsessed with growing large vegetables for the annual fair and who operate ""Anti-Pesto,"" a humane solution to all those pesky rabbits that torment passionate gardeners everywhere. The business is a great success--but Wallace proves a bit too clever for his own good. When he tries to ""rehabilitate"" rabbits from their vegetable-crunching ways, he unexpectedly unleashes an ancient horror of legendary proportions: the Were-Rabbit! And suddenly no vegetable in town is safe! The movie is full of crazy inventions, unexpectedly smart dialogue, and references to everything from KING KONG to THE WOLF MAN--more than enough to entice even a jaded teenager--but the real charm of the thing is in its characters. The amount of personality the artists and animators can wring from bits of clay is amazing: they seem as fully alive as any flesh-and-blood actor. The DVD release (and I recommend the widescreen) includes a number of informative and entertaining extras as well. Greatly recommended! GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
141,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,16 May 2007,"charming characters, snappy animation, but a bit too long","The first full-length film featuring the Aardman characters Wallace and Gromit manages to bring in elements of all the previous half-hour show which aired on television.Wallace runs a company to humanely capture rogue rabbits from people's vegetable gardens, and has the bright idea to try out his invention on the hapless bunnies once they're caught. Of course, as in other Wallace and Gromit films, things don't quite work out as planned.Similarly to A Close Shave, there's a love interest for Wallace, in this case the village Lady Posh, and a big mean villain with a bullish dog. Gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh out loud funny. And of course Peter Sallis provides the voice of Wallace again and is a perfect fit.And as in A Grand Day Out, cheese features heavily to great comedic effect as the film moves along.On the negative side this film is a little on the long side. There are great effects, and some pieces which make you sit up and watch, but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to feature-length."
142,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,10 January 2007,Another Wallace and Gromit Classic,Following on from the huge success of Nick Park and the Aardman team with the Wallace and Gromit short animations we now have the first (hopefully of many) feature with the plasticine characters that so many love. The DVD of the movie has proved to be the most durable and best used of my two children's many Christmas presents by a long way. The plot of the movie is straightforward enough but the beauty of the W & G films for me is the background gags. There are plenty of up front gags and slapstick for kids and adults to enjoy but the background is the killer for me. All in a classy addition to an already classy filmography for Nick Park etal and I would recommend fans and new watchers to see this film....often.
143,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,31 December 2006,A cracking film for all ages,"When I watched ""Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" on its opening weekend I was, not surprisingly, very impressed. Nick Park has a solid reputation for delivering the goods and this is his greatest achievement to-date. It's, to paraphrase Wallace, a cracking film for all ages.There are great references to other movies that should appeal to the movie buff element of the audience and enough general jokes to please everybody. My eyes were watering with laughter throughout.The film looks great, as you'd expect from Nick Park. The level of detail is simply staggering and the visual gags are breathtaking. Clever stuff, indeed.I dearly hope that there are many more adventures for Wallace and Gromit to come!"
144,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,28 December 2006,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,"Simply delightful claymation feature from Nick Park and company spoofing such film-greats as ""King Kong"" and ""The Wolf Man"" has Wallace and Gromit as rabbit security finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their village..a giant were-rabbit is feasting lavishly on the vegetable crops of the citizens! What makes this even worse is that the great vegetable festival is about to commence and the citizens have all prepared dutifully to win the top of prize. What makes the situation even worse is Wallace is the reason behind the whole vegetable-eating rampage..he was testing out a new invention regarding taking his brain waves in an attempt to brain wash captured rabbits into disliking vegetable crops. What occurs is catastrophic as some sort of hybrid were-rabbit is created in the process..and it has more to do with Wallace than he could ever imagine. It'll be up to his loyal(..and startlingly intelligent)and fast-thinking dog Gromit to save the day.This is a clever and imaginative effort from the crew behind other Oscar winning claymation features starring Wallace and Gromit. Seeing good ole-fashioned claymation is refreshing considering the CGI boom that has featured rather lackluster fare here recently as the industry spits out more and more mediocre product. Here, we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation, not to mention gut-busting sight gags."
145,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,27 December 2006,One of the best animated movies i've ever seen!,"When Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his dog partner Gromit make a special humane pest control service called ""Anti-Pesto"", they capture and try to brainwash all the local town's rabbits from vegetable-eating machines to anti-vegetable eaters that have been in the local gardens of residents and must try to win the hand of Lady Tottington . There's a vegetable competition going on soon but when one of Wallace's inventions get out of hand, there's a humongous rabbit creature called The Were-Rabbit causing some trouble in the night and a vicious hunter (voiced by Ralph Fiennes) out to kill it.Wonderful animated comedy from Aardman studios and is the first motion picture for the popular British clay-mated characters Wallace and Gromit. Director and Aardman creator Nick Park has made another clay-animated masterpiece much like his ""Wallace and Gromit"" shorts and his ""Chicken Run"", after five years in the making Aardman set out to do the impossible much like their first full length picture ""Chicken Run"" about 7 years ago as they have succeeded into making one of the best and most entertaining animated movies of all time.The animation is crafted perfectly since it is Clay animation combined with CGI and the voice acting is terrific, this is an experience in animation not to be missed.Watch it, please!"
146,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,24 December 2006,This Oscar-winning clay animation is a great film,"Plot: Wacky inventor Wallace and his silent canine Gromit start a humane pest control company, seeing as rabbits seem to be taking over local resident's gardens. Something goes awry and a giant rabbit is now on the loose and causing havoc in town.What's Right With It? The film is witty and funny with British humor at its best. The clay animation is done very well and best of all the story keeps you entertained all the way through. There is even an unexpected twist!What's Wrong With It? Not particularly for young kids so don't expect them to enjoy it. Teens and adults will love it.Try It If You Like: Corpse Bride, Wallace & Gromit series, Toy Story and Chicken Run.Worth Buying? I'd say so if you are a DVD collector or a fan of animated films of the 21st century.Verdict Nick Park, the director took 5 years to make this film. The reason is that it took a whole day to make 3 seconds worth of the film. I'd say it was worth it."
147,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,18 December 2006,Just perfect.,"Don't give your kids this movie on DVD unless you have plenty of time on your hands. It is one of the only movies that no matter which scene is on when you come into the room, you will inevitably find yourself thinking ""Oh! This is a really good bit!"" and being drawn in again. :-)Not that that is any bad thing, as each time you watch, you will get more out of it. Not just the wonderful hare-brained (sorry) plot, and the supremely daffy characters, but all the detail and visual jokes in every scene.Don't over-analyse this film. Just revel in the sheer joy of a movie that simply could not have been any better, and hope to goodness that they are working on the next one.And while you are about it, thank Dreamworks for having the good sense not to meddle, but to let Nick Park and Aardman make this movie the way they wanted to."
148,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,28 November 2006,excellent  film for children and myself,"I really enjoyed this film and i think it will be very appealing towards children and adults.Nick Park is a great movie maker as he has made a marvelous variety of ""Wallace and Gromit"" films.What i enjoyed about the film was that it was a good storyline and a script,i personally liked the part were ""Hutch"" (The rabbit) was turning into Wallace and was speaking it was funny for all the family.Further more i did enjoy the characters parts and speech.On the other hand i didn't really enjoy the part were there are lots of dialogue because sometimes i find it a bit boring.But still i did like the film."
149,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,29 October 2006,A great film - the dangerous duo's big screen adaptation is a huge success!,"The Wallace and Gromit shows have never flopped. They have all won Oscars (except the first one, which only got a nomination) because of the genius that goes into animating them. And all the greatness of the animation is thrown into a boiling pot with a stronger plot, more new characters, some action scenes and bright new ideas, and stirred for some time. And what comes out? This classic animated film - which is a treat for kids and adults alike.The animation is just as stunning, and Wallace and Gromit have deservedly beat off all other animated features to take the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, which they very much deserve. The plot is stronger this time round - some parts of the film actually grip and shock you - definite thumbs up. A potentially stupid idea is turned into a movie which works in every aspect. The script is great, with hilarious humour and one-liners, and we are introduced to some brand new characters, who prove to be as interesting as Wallace and Gromit themselves.The amount of care that went into making this film was tremendous - it must have taken years. The action sequences in this film are of a larger scale and more epic, but are done flawlessly and very well indeed. Overall, there is nothing wrong with this film at all - Wallace and Gromit's big-screen adaptation is one to be reckoned with, and one that shall not ashame the originals (in fact, it will make them all proud). Everything, from the script to the animation, works in this film - making Wallace and Gromit one of our country's proudest achievements.Overall, I feel that Wallace and Gromit is a film that got everything it deserved - the Oscar, a worthy 2-disc DVD release, the dizzy heights of success that its predecessors earned, and finally - a successful attempt at bringing two very loved animated characters into the new millennium. A stunning job! 10/10"
150,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,1 October 2006,"Wallace=Master, Gromit=Mind (Piece)","If memory serve me correct Wallace and Grommet has been there since 1989, it was one of a kind then and with it brilliant storyline and animation it has created the fan base all over the globe. 16 years later Wallace and Grommet find itself on the big screen and the best part is it still the same character that we fell in love, and still is one of a kind. This time around our heroes must stop the Were-Rabbit that been terrorize the small town annual vegetable competition.What so special about this movie it is still one of the only few clay animations out there. Plus with the brilliantly storyline and great script makes this movie an absolute must watch list. The movie also has a dazzling cinematography and brilliant direction. And probably one of the best animations (of all kind) out there you have ever seen. Everything in the movie seem to work out just right, from the dialogs to the little British accent, the style of the movie, the score, design, everything! Everything I remember Wallace of in the short film is right in here. Brilliant!!!Extra: If you get the DVD, There are loads and loads of extra footage and commentary = more fun.Reason To Watch: Still Is The Best Clay Animation Around.Reason Not To: If You Can One Let Me Know.Rating: 8.5/10 (Grade: A).Please Rate After Reading (Y/N), Thank You."
151,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,27 September 2006,Laugh out loud funny!,"In 1989 the animated duo, Wallace & Gromit debuted to instant success. The short films ""The Wrong Trousers"" and ""A Close Shave"" earned creator Nick Park an Academy Award in 1993 and 1995! This year, their first feature film hit the big screen, WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT. When the town's vegetables are being mysteriously devoured in the night, inventor Wallace, and his canine partner Gromit, come to the rescue. Their 'Anti-Pesto SWAT Team' is on the case and on the trail of this enormous beastly rabbit that is terrifying the town's inhabitants! The love interest in the movie, Lady Campanula Tottington, is voiced by Helena Bonham Carter, and Wallace's arch nemesis, Victor Quartermaine, is voiced by none other than actor Ralph Fiennes. Carter was the voice of Johnny Depp's bride in Tim Burton's animated film Corpse Bride that came out last year. The gadgets and gizmos that Wallace and Gromit use are imaginative and ingenious. From their daily life, to the mechanisms they use in attempting to catch the fluffy monster, you are in for a wild ride with these two endearing characters! The rest of the film is packed with memorable characters as well, with zany voices and facial expressions that combine to be laugh out loud funny! The creators of this Wallace & Gromit feature, also created the successful hit Chicken Run, which was released back in 2000. This new film is just as memorable, with an equally entertaining story that adults and kids can enjoy. The claymation is astoundingly good, and in these days of computer animated features, its refreshing to see something real and fleshed out in clay moving before your eyes. The manpower that went into creating this 85-minute film was great, with progress slow and work tedious. Many comparable films are created on a computer grid, with keystrokes and mapping, but this was created the old fashioned way - with sets and pieces being manipulated manually through countless hours of physical labor! The final product is visually impressive, and will keep you smiling and laughing the whole way through. This vegetarian horror film is alongside Disney's CARS as one of my favorite animated films of 2006. Laughter is the best medicine, so be sure to put this on your list of antidotes."
152,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,16 August 2006,A Perfect Film,"The sets, the music, the detail, the animation, the writing, its all perfect. One of the things about model animation is it has to be planned out to the last frame before anything is even shot and it shows in this, the first feature to star Wallace and Gromit. Its British to the core and proud.Hopefully there will be a follow up to this, a film that is sure to become a classic in the years to come. Aardman show and prove that they are the masters of the clay! A rarity in this age of CG animation that is more and more beginning to fall short on the jokes and rely on the flat spectacle unlike Were-Rabbit.Excellent piece of family entertainment!"
153,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,2 July 2006,"Simply smashing, astonishing animation","Even people who aren't fans of stop-animation movies, such as the old-timey Gumby cartoons, will love the heck out of this one. Clever and knee-slappingly funny, W&G's latest is about another of Wallace's inventions gone awry.Seems the town has a rabbit problem, and Wallace's Anti-Pesto company is right for the job. Only Wallace gets it in his head that he wants to brainwash his captive rabbits, and in doing so he accidentally transfers part of his mind into a rabbit - and part of a rabbit's mind into his own - creating a ... DA DA DA!!!! Were-Rabbit! This wreaks havoc with the town's annual vegetable festival, as you can quite imagine. If Anti-Pesto can't stop the Were-Rabbit, who can? Could it be Lady Tottington's (Helena Bonham Carter) not-quite fiancé Victor (Ralph Fiennes), who wants to shoot all the little bunnies he sees anyway? Let's hope not. And will Victor get to the Were-Rabbit before the irate townsfolk, complete with pitchforks, knives, and chainsaws, do? Never mind that a were-rabbit would be wolf-rabbit, not a rabbit-man, but hey - who cares? Probably not you, or you'd have stopped reading by now, since those who care about such nuance have no reason to like this kind of kidfare in the first place. But don't kid yourself. Although this is a kid's film, you'd be hard pressed not to find it to be a real stitch, even if you're a full-blown adult. From Wallace's cheese addiction to Gromit's well-worn way of getting his master out of trouble, there's a lot to like about the movie for both kidlets and grown kids.Among the highlights are a ""dogfight"" between Gromit and Victor's dog - in planes from a kids' ride at the local fair; Wallace's suck invention (it sucks the bunnies out of the ground, unharmed); and Fiennes' characterization. Really, good smashing fun for everyone."
154,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,26 June 2006,A fun film for the whole family!,"Beloved animated characters Wallace and Gromit are back for another adventure and this time, it involves a were-rabbit. Wallace invents a gadget that he proposes will help brainwash captured rabbits into despising vegetables, by replacing their thoughts with his own dislike for the food group. Something goes wrong (he is testing the gadget for the first time anyhow) during the experiment and he ends up being saved by Gromit who damages the gadget in the process. Later that night, a monster arises and begins to terrorise the villagers, stealing their prize winning vegetables and damaging property. A town's meeting is called the next day and it is decided that Anti-Pesto's Wallace and Gromit will be given a second chance to try and capture this new type of rabbit dubbed the WERE RABBIT. During their new stakeout, Gromit finds out that the is more to the story than meets the eye. Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter and Liz Smith all provide voices for characters in the Oscar and multi-award winning film!"
155,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,26 June 2006,delightful animated film,"""Wallace and Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is a charming and delightful big screen version of a series that has achieved considerable popularity on television. Wallace and his poker-faced dog Gromit work as pest-control experts in a town whose citizenry have devoted virtually their entire lives to the raising of prize-winning vegetables. When the villagers' crops are suddenly threatened by a mysterious killer rabbit right on the eve of the annual vegetable festival, Wallace and Gromit spring into action, until it dawns on them that they themselves might have inadvertently precipitated the crisis.In an era in which virtually every animated film achieves its effects through CGI graphics, it's a joy to see a work return to the time-honored tradition of stop motion claymation as its medium of choice. With its exquisite backgrounds and beguiling colors, the film tells its simple story without all the frenetic action that has overwhelmed even some of the better animated films of the past several years. With a wry sense of humor and a deadpan appreciation for the surreal and the absurd, ""Wallace and Gromit"" may be even more fun for adults than it is for the young."
156,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,16 June 2006,"A Good, Wholesome Romp","Wallace, a rather perplexing and perplexed inventor, and Gromit, his faithful, silent dog, are the two central animated leads in this clever story about Wallace and Gromit running a bunny round-up ""extermination"" business to save all the large, luscious vegetables - all of which are going to the regional giant vegetable growing contest. Wallace, through some inventing mishap, creates a huge, vegetable-devouring were-rabbit and must learn how to stop the creation he has unleashed on the quaint English countryside village. This movie really surprised me. I thought it would be a cute little animated film but found it to be so much more. The animation is different than anything I had ever seen. Directors Steve Box and Nick Park have created a world all of their own that seems almost real despite the ridiculousness that surrounds everything like a giant, ferocious hare and vegetables the size of trucks! The characters do not look very realistic at all yet are compelling characters with lots of personality and heart. The vocal talents of especially Peter Sallis as Wallace, Ray Fiennes, and Helena Bonham Carter and others solidify this. But at the heart of this film is the universal story of a man and his best friend. The two get into quite a few mishaps yet through all the laughs there is an undeniable bond. I really enjoyed Wallace and Gromit a lot more than I originally thought I would. It is very original and very, very funny. It is also one of the few animated films out there that is totally fit for children without the need to include what many might consider dubious material(like Shrek, Shrek 2, Robots, etc...all of which I like but find they have questionable material for smaller children)."
157,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,14 June 2006,Exquisitely Crafted Horror,"Seeing this right after ""...Black Lagoon"" reminds me of just how stupid so many early monster features were. In contrast, this is smart, smart, smart at every turn.This time, Park has expanded and populated the W & G world; he fixes the central shortcoming of ""A Close Shave"": he has brought back the noir construction of the inventor within losing control of the machinery to a nefarious force that toys with him.Here, Park gets to incorporate ideas from film classics and gets a feature length in which to flesh it all out. He has crafted this artificial world down to the most excruciating detail, using all of the best parts of the prior three W & G shorts.The central borrowings are ""Curse of the Werewolf"", ""The Fly"" (both the original and the remake), with a hint of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". Along the way, there are plenty of clever 'Bugs Bunny' visual quotes. The climax very precisely pays homage to ""King Kong"".For most movies, it's enough to make smart use of story narrative...but Park goes the extra step of filming this world with a care we seldom see. The camera is acknowledged in every scene; it is curious, it explores from impossible perspectives; it provides the requisite degree of subtlety.Here's to hoping that all of Aardman's future projects remain so enjoyably free of Dreamworks' audience testing and industrial pressures toward mediocrity."
158,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,1 June 2006,It is the best movie ever!,"Wallace and Gromit is the best movie I have ever seen! It is hilarious and really cute, the plot is very original and i would definitely recommend watching it; you definitely won't regret it. Although some people might think it is going to be childish, with plasticine models, it isn't and has something for all age groups to enjoy, which is what makes it such a great movie. I have it on DVD and have watched it loads of times, and i am still not bored of it!(you notice new subtle jokes every time that you don't see the first time, because there are so many subtle jokes, you cannot possibly see them all! I highly recommend this, and I give it 10 out of 10."
159,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,17 May 2006,Entertaining and well worth checking out.,"The upcoming vegetable competition is proving to be an obsession for the villagers, including the wealthy Lady Tottington, but is in danger from an explosion in the rabbit population. Fortunately Wallace the inventor and his dog Gromit have a new sideline in pest control, but Wallace pushes his luck too far when he hatches a plan to eradicate the rabbit threat for good.This latest extravaganza from Nick Park's Aardman Animations is the 4th outing for Wallace and Gromit, their first full-length film following on from the success of Chicken Run. Though most animation films now use CGI, Aardman have thankfully stuck to their Plasticene roots. This medium has some definite advantages over CGI, such as the ability to employ natural light.The film is resolutely old-fashioned, and makes few concessions to international audiences. This is the world of 1950's England, reflected in the dialogue and accents, as well as the characters of the villagers, many of whom wouldn't look out of place in an Ealing comedy. Gromit on the other hand resembles a silent movie star, able to convey an amazing range of emotions through his eyes.Comparing Were-Rabbit to Wallace and Gromit's earlier adventures, the film most closely resembles A Close Shave, substituting rabbits for sheep, and having a similar love sub-plot. The film's main challenge was to extend its plot over more than 80 minutes. It occasionally feels slightly stretched and some of the twists are ridiculous even for this series, but on the whole it achieves a remarkable level of success.Overall the film doesn't reach the standard of The Wrong Trousers, but it's very entertaining and well worth checking out."
160,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,21 April 2006,An extraordinary animated achievement,"Although I've only seen pieces of Nick Park's three original short films involving the titular characters of Wallace and Gromit, I was still ecstatic to see the full length film. The fact that it won the Best Animated Film Oscar at the recent award show only helped add to this excitement. And I was not left disappointed.Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his mute dog Gromit are inventors. While inventing a number of helpful things around the house, they also invented devices to help monitor the gardens of every resident in town. Their business, Anti-Pesto (just the start of the witty plays-on-words), helps in this conquest. But after collecting enough rabbits to fill their entire basement, Wallace gets the idea to try and warp the minds of a few of them to not want to eat vegetables. It seems to work, but only days later, a vicious giant were-rabbit appears, and tears apart most of the residents' gardens. So Wallace and Gromit set out to find the beast, but have to contend with Victor Quartermaine (the delightful Ralph Fiennes), in order to take it down.Yes, the plot may seem a little silly, but the film is great. From start to finish, it keeps entertaining, and never lets up. The pop culture and film references are just littered throughout, as are clever plays-on words (which should delight the adults who will get them undoubtedly more than the kids). The film took five years to make, and it looks like the creators took a little care on more than just the animation. If anything, the film is too short, clocking in at under 90 minutes. While not as short as another recent still-animated feature (the excellent Tim Burton's Corpse Bride), it takes away from any extra fun the audience may get out of the film that they may get with others (like The Incredibles, or the Shrek series).I will totally applaud one aspect that helped the animators in making the film short. They cut out any possibility for a song and dance number. If there is anything in modern animated films that drives me nuts, it's the addition of a needless song and dance. If the film was a Disney musical, okay. But every animated film coming out now is not, so it does not need it. Nick Park and Co. make their film that much more appealing for kids and adults by not including one (although it did make the deleted scenes on the DVD).As said, the animation is spectacular and absolutely flawless. While there may be fingerprints on some of the characters, it only adds to the excellence put forth by the animators. Each character has something special all their own, and not one character looks alike. Great care was put into how they all move, act and speak, and you can tell how painstaking it was for the animators to get it all right. The only curious element here is why the were-rabbit has fur, and all the rest of the bunnies are perfectly molded plasticine with no fur.Sallis continues his greatness as Wallace, and Fiennes breathes fiendish delight into his character. You may not realize it's him at first, but it only takes an extra thinking moment to realize for sure. Helena Bodham Carter continues the greatness she had in Bride, and brings it here. She has a perfect voice for animated films, and her take on her character is a great comparison piece to the Corpse Bride. The supporting cast all have great voices, and equally show off a stunning appeal for this film.A great film through and through, Wallace & Gromit is well worth a watch, and well worth the time put into it. Only a few added minutes could have helped this film become even more extraordinary than it already is.8/10."
161,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,20 April 2006,Cracking Movie Gromit! A Kid's Review,"Another amazing Wallace and Gromit Feature. Three words that describe this movie perfectly are: Amazing!, Hilarious!, and Genius! THIS MOVIE IS A Definite MUST SEE. The wonderful thing about Aardman is they include jokes for adults, jokes for kids, and jokes for EVERYONE. I cannot explain how wonderful the clay animation is in this masterpiece. So far i'm just saying see it! See it! SEEEEEEE IIIIIIIIIIT! The movie is to good for me to tell you the storyline now. Go see it, enjoy it, and although, it seems childish, trust me IT ISN'T!!!! It is a great family film, and you will throughly enjoy and embrace this comedy movie. Just go see it...and FAST!!!!!!"
162,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,16 April 2006,Note perfect!,"An absolute joy from beginning to end. A superb example of perfect film making. A wonderous script, fantastic animation and a charm and wit that is utterly infectious. It's a film that leaves you with a spring in your step and a smile on your face. It doesn't outstay it's welcome, it has no sagging middle and heroically avoids any message, skips the Disney song and dance number and - praise the chuffing lord - refuses to allow any one to learn about the importance of friendship or any other valuable life lessons.It's a film whose single mission statement is to entertain.Were-Rabbit ranks alongside the finest Pixar has to offer.This was the first film we took our 2 year old son to. He was utterly captivated by it and stayed rooted to his seat throughout the entire film. His eyes wide with wonder. We went back to see it a second time recently and he spent the entire film stood holding onto the seat back in front (empty - before any of you start). The day it came out on DVD we brought it, he hopped with delight and watched it repeatedly. In fact, he would happily watch this endlessly given half the chance.Although there is something quintessentially British about Wallace and Grommit there's also something that transcends its Britishness. If you're feeling low, watch it and get swept up by it's gloriousness."
163,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,11 April 2006,I'm 'crackers' about cheese!,"If you have any sense of humour, even the a little bit, this movie for you. You'll laugh no matter what. I don't really know why I liked this movie; I mean, I've never seen any of the other 'Wallace and Gromit' things. I didn't even know that it existed for that matter. But after seeing this movie, I wondered how I could have missed out on something so funny, and so brilliant. Some of the jokes actually made me laugh later, just thinking about them. I won't spoil anything for you, because if there's one thing I hate is knowing what happens before the first scene is over. Overall, this is one of my favourite children's movies. It makes me smile just writing this. We love Hutch!"
164,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,11 April 2006,Fantastic Movie,What would you expect with a Wallace and Gromit Movie. This was a spectacular movie that delivered just about everything to satisfy its crowd. What I like about the movie is that it's very safe for kids. Lately the trend is for animated films to have adult references but this movie is for everyone. At most it will give kids a small fright but it will pass. The humor is very family friendly and very enjoyable. The characters in this movie are spectacular. We get Wallace and Gromit back but we also get more characters than any other W&G film. Ms. Tottington is a great laugh and she helps move the story along as the gullible yet lovable mistress. Victor the villain is very mischievous with his hunt dog. He seems to have the villain like roles rapped up along with some cruel humor of his. The other great characters like the adorable bunnies are fun to watch. The plot is very well put together and is a treat for Halloween Nights. What I enjoyed the most... was Gromit. I've never seen such character development without any lines uttered. Gromit's facial expressions tell you a lot about him. He is actual made to do more things and really.... take more action than ever before. The rivalries in this movie are very well done. The action scenes in here were great such as Gromit getting behind the wheel and chasing the beast. W&G have the same gadgets with lots of development to show that times have changed. Overall a smashing film for Wallace and Gromit. Glad Peter Sallis reprized his role as Wallace. 5 years were taken to make this film. They sure put their hearts into this well awaited film. A salute to a job well done from Wallace and Gromit.
165,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,9 April 2006,Charming,"Clever, Funny, Witty, Entertaining. Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the better films to come out last year.To tell the truth, I am not a fan of claymation. I prefer good old fashioned hand Drawn. However, this was every bit as good as chicken Run and the older Wallace & Gromit Movies. It was good to see something rather original as opposed to so much crap they release now adays. And from an Animated film. G-Rated, yet can appeal to almost anyone, even older audiences. The film Contained so many witty gags, that you have to watch it more than once to get them all. They can be pretty funny once you think about them.The voice acting was done well. A cast of good actors whom have good voices, fit their characters perfectly. I personally liked Helena Bonhem Carter the most, she fit the Role of Totty just dead on. Not many flaws here. If you enjoy British Humor, than I say go ahead and check it out. You will have some fun for 85 minutes. I know I did."
166,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,7 April 2006,"Short but not too short. A cure for a bad day, carried in a small bottle.","Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is the first feature from the famous animated series I've seen so far. Frankly I could say it's the finest computer-animated film I've seen so far. I'm not much of a fan of these sort of films and I must admit that I haven't seen neither one of the proverbial Pixar animations. On the other hand as it's written in my Madagascar comment, I've seen quite a few of them produced by DreamWorks. And if that studio ever hit a nail with these movies, they did it this time.The set is an old, small and quite conservative English town. And it's not long until the villagers are hasting for the help of our inventive and crafty pair. Together they run a fine business, perfectly suited for this environment. We could call them parasitology specialists. As they salve most of the problems in no-time, using state of the art technology, the master Gromit gets a little too inventive. Meanwhile we get to know the town's cream. Kind and fluffy-loving Lady Tottington along with her suitor, snobbish Victor Quartermaine. The town is also fully prepared for the most important event of the year. The annual Giant Vegetable Competition. The villagers, including Lady Tottington are all first class veggie-maniacs. By this time something outrageous is happening to the peoples potentially prize-winning vegetables. Every night an unknown predator sabotages their work. So who you 'gonna' call? Pestbusters!The clay-CGI really worked for me. If you noticed it's really interesting how the distant objects seem so real. The closeups seemed more cartoon-like. As for the film itself, it's amazing. The humor is multi-layered. The little bunnies will appeal to kids. The cowardly vicar was my coupe of tea and the 'Were-Rabbit' was drop dead hilarious. Then we have Gromit and his rival and especially the amazing and thrilling action sequences towards the end. What's also become a tradition in this genre are the movie references. They play a part towards the end and are a fine insert, ranging from King Kong to 8 Mile and a few others. Some characters did seem annoying. Lady Tottington was one of them. Her image didn't really bring much good to the movie, except for the unraveling of the Wallace-Lady-Victor triangle for which we all knew how it's going to end. All I can say is see it, it's a must-see if you like animated movies. ........ +4/5 ......."
167,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,2 April 2006,"Good, but not as good as the short films.","We're both really big fans of the Wallace and Gromit short films A Grand Day Out, The Wrong Trousers and The Close Shave - we can watch those over and over again, without getting tired of them. So when we rented this film we were expecting great things from it. Unfortunately, while it IS watchable, it just didn't live up to our expectations, or to the standards of the shorts that preceded it.At times, the film is funny, with clever ideas and funny jokes added in from the beginning to the end, but for us, it just wasn't as entertaining as the old short films were. The animation and voice acting are as good as ever, but it's content where it seems to fall short - some of the scenes seem drawn out, and in the end, it felt more like a short that had been stretched out than it did a film. The time had been filled, instead of used.In the end, it's not bad - it's certainly watchable, it's enjoyable, and there are worse ways to spend an evening. But for us, it's just not as good as the short films that made Wallace and Gromit so popular in the first place."
168,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,27 March 2006,It's great!,"This film is absolutely fabulous! It's great to see someone who feels something for Wallace (even if they don't get together in the end.) It's also good to finally see Wallace standing up for himself and his lady love. It's also full of great comedy like when Victor pinned Lady T's hair to the marrow and said ""You look good with your hair pinned back."" And the little bunnies are SO sweet, they can be really funny and really sweet. Also this film is full of bad puns but it they come off as funny because it IS Wallace and Gromit, my favourite was when Gromit open the storage tin marked ""Buns"" and there were 3 bunnies inside it and also (some of you may not get this.) The carrot sign that is ripped down said ""Harvey's"" as in the giant invisible rabbit of the film Harvey. Time and again this film will always be a classic and you see something new every time."
169,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,26 March 2006,Charm Plus,"It doesn't get better than this. Wallace and Gromit hit another home run on this veritable vegetarian venture into the unknown realm of the horrible were-RABBIT!You know Monty Python warned of the killer rabbit... here we have evidence for the existence of the horrible ... very horrible ... were-rabbit! Hide your pets; hide your friends; HIDE YOUR VEGETABLES!This is an absolute joy to watch. The detail is so good that in one scene I forgot these were only clay-mation figures. Also, some of the laughs are rip-roaringly funny. This is a movie for everyone who is young at heart = all ages are welcome! 10+/10-Zafoid"
170,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,22 March 2006,Brought a big ol' smile on my face.,"I can't start to tell you how refreshing and great it is to see the return of the lovable twosome known as Wallace and Gromit. It's been a whole decade since they did their last short film. In total three have been made, from 1989 to 1995. After the delightful Chicken Run (which used the same technique of stop motion animation), Nick Park returned to create the first motion picture with the Oscar winning duo. This time around, they're up against non-other than the Were Rabbit. So sit down, relax, and hide all your vegetables, you might find them missing by the time the movie is done.Approaching at a fast pace is the annual Giant Vegetable Competition, and Wallace (voice of veteran actor Peter Sallis), along with his non-speaking canine friend, Gromit, are in hot pursuit of all the rabbits eating the competitors crops and vegetables. They run a vegetable security and humane pest control business, ""Anti-Pesto"". Every night they are called in after the hopping fiends. During one of these occasions Wallace falls in love with one of the richest woman in the whole town, Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter). Victor (Ralph Fiennes), a malevolent hunter of all things rabbit, soon finds competition in Wallace because he wants to marry Lady Tottington for her money and only her money.A problem soon arises; there is not enough space for all the animals in the cages for the rabbits. Wallace being the grand inventor he is makes a machine called the brain alteration- o-matic. He uses it on a good portion of the bunnies, and hypnotizes them into disliking vegetables. Something goes horribly wrong when Gromit pushes a wrong button, leaving a rabbit named ""Hutch"" stuck in the machine. They soon save him only to find everything is not normal with the once happy animal. Lurking in the darkness an ominous creature called the Were-Rabbit is eating all the vegetables. The towns people are furious and they request that AntiPesto find the beast and catch it. Victor has other plans up his sleeve. He plans to kill it, and be the hero. On the day of the competition, it seems the Were-Rabbit is still alive and it's up to the pair to save the vegetables from being the creatures' dinner.The story is very well done. It's like an animated version of An American Werewolf In Paris, Frankenstein and King Kong. An extremely entertaining thing they do with the movie is that they parody the films above. As an alternative of a silver bullet to kill a were-wolf you need a gold bullet to kill a were-rabbit. The planes that were flying around at the end, attacking the were-rabbit are an obvious parody of King Kong. A lot of witty play on words are also used. Dogwarts is used instead of Hogwarts (from the ever popular Harry Potter series). The books containing cheese in Wallace's library also include slightly different terminologies, like Grated Expectations, Swiss Cheese Family Robinson, and Fromage to Eternity. The only problem I found with the film is that it was much too short. I wanted to see more of the two friends and the were-rabbit. The director cut out some very funny scenes that could have made it all that betters. Perhaps the best part of The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is how sweet and funny it can be. I laughed more during this supposed kid's movie than during all the inane comedies of last year put together. And that includes the awful remake of The Longest Yard. The direction by Nick Park is superb. He uses effects in stop motion animation that we've never seen before. If you were to look on the DVD at the ""Making of"" featurette, you'd see how much time and precision it takes to make a movie like this. They used about five molds for each main character in different emotional states. It also took a whole lot of rabbits. He also cleverly adds in other elements from the previous stories. The penguin from the short ""The Wrong Trousers"" even has a 10 second cameo. But I'll leave it a surprise. Despite it's look, Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a movie not just for the little ones, but for adults as well. It had excellent mature humour and enough slapstick to keep the kids entertained. This movie brought a big ol' smile on my face and I'm sure it will for you too."
171,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,11 March 2006,Best animated film I've ever seen!,"I've loved Wallace & Gromit since I was six years old, so I was particularly happy when I finally got to see their feature debut, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. I had to wait for some time, though, since it was released in Italy two days before the 2006 Academy Awards. Which is better, in a way, as I therefore knew I was going to see a good film, freshly awarded with the Best Animated Feature Oscar, and deservedly so. Of all the winners so far (Shrek, Spirited Away, which is the only one I still haven't viewed, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and W & G), this wonderful collaboration between Dreamworks and Aardman is the absolute best.Its main charm is the fact that, despite the bigger scope, longer running time and Hans Zimmer's contribution to the music, the film remains undeniably, deliciously British. Even the only two celebrity voices, Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes, are pure-blood Brits, and their performances are just one of the things that make The Curse of the Were-Rabbit a modern classic.This delightful ""horror"" comedy sees Wallace, still a brilliant inventor and compulsive cheese-eater (and still voiced by Peter Sallis), and Gromit, still the one to really save the day when things get bad, embrace a huge responsibility: the two run Anti-Pesto, a company whose function is to make sure rabbits won't eat everyone's vegetables before the annual contest. The competition takes place at Tottington Hall, where Lady Campanula Tottington (Carter) lives. Wallace immediately falls for her, and vows to make sure her garden will remain untouched. Unfortunately for him, two problems are on their way: Victor Quatermaine (Fiennes), an arrogant, narcissistic hunter (think Shrek 2's Prince Charming minus the Charming and the gay subtext), and the titular bunny, who's about to cause a lot of trouble.Almost 17 years on, Wallace and Gromit have lost absolutely none of their universal comic appeal, as people still laugh at their alternate moments in the spotlight. The script comprises impeccable gags, mostly visual (I was already grinning within the first 30 seconds of the movie), interesting, human characters and pop culture references which don't feel inappropriate or unnecessary at all (spoofs include King Kong, Harry Potter and even classics such as How Green Was My Valley, East of Eden and Brief Encounter).A great deal of the movie's magic is also linked to the animation technique: whereas Tim Burton's excellent Corpse Bride looked a little more CG than stop-motion, the W & G flick is pure claymation, and it's beautiful (there is some CGI, but you probably won't notice it). In a time where almost all animated films in the world, apart from the Studio Ghibli pictures, are made with pixels instead of pencils, the experience of watching a traditionally made cartoon is something that can't be easily matched by anything else.So, in a few words, Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is, with very little, if any, doubt, the best animated feature I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. It's constantly entertaining, never daft, and leaves you wanting more. Let's hope a sequel will show up in the near future..."
172,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,11 March 2006,Cleverly funny and made with eye for detail...only complaint; it's too short!,"Lot's of cheese might be featured in this movie but the movie itself is far from cheesy. It's a cleverly made movie, of which its humor relies on its timing and characters, rather then the script.What a wonderful achievement this movie is. The claymation is even more detailed and better looking as in the previous Aardman/DreamWorks production ""Chicken Run"" was the case. The movie is made with eye for detail and features lots of complex, almost flawless sequence's, with lots of pace and detailed camera-work.But the thing that makes this movie so much fun to watch is its humor. It has some incredible good timing, even though I'm sure of it that it must be very hard to time correctly while working with claymation. It takes lots of talent and experience to make a movie like this. That's why Aardman will probably stay lonesome at top of claymation and stop-motion for the next 10 years. The movie is also filled with tons of visual gags. You'll discover some new things, every time you watch this movie. It shows how incredible detailed the movie is. The movie is fun to watch for the entire family. The children will find the almost slapstick/cartoon like humor with Wallace and Gromit amusing, while the more older viewer should be able to appreciate the visual and more adult orientated visual jokes, characters and dialog. There is something for everyone to enjoy here in this movie.The story is very simple and also quite ridiculous. It's so intendedly ridiculous that it's also at the very same time extremely hilarious. Of course you shouldn't take this movie serious. It's one of those movies which requires you to switch of your brain and just sit back, relax and just watch the movie and take it for what it is.Another element that makes ""Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" such a great movie is its action. Just like in ""Chicken Run"" the action in the movie is incredibly good paced, directed and executed and also highly original at the very same time. Truly better than the stuff in 80% of the 'serious' action-movies, made these days.However the pace is also a bit of a problem. Everything is paced so fast, that it's over before you know it. It was so much fun that I wanted to see more and didn't wanted it to end. Of course it's not a real serious complaint though, in terms of that it made the movie any worser or less enjoyable to watch.An entertaining Oscar winning movie that shouldn't be missed by you!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
173,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,2 March 2006,"CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT : Makes For Fast-Paced, Cleverly Stupid Entertainment...","WALLACE & GROMIT : THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT After three knock-out animated shorts, Wallace & his faithful dog Gromit get a chance to stretch their legs in a major motion picture... and although they stretched their legs a bit too far, it's an overall enjoyable ride.My only real problem with the film was that it went on too long. Now these are characters that have clearly shown how perfectly they fit into ""short films""... and while their appeal is more than enough to carry a full-length film, it needed to be shorter. 85 minutes is rather long for a full-length animated feature to begin with, and the characters' appeal starts to lose steam in the final 20 minutes.Aside from the running time though, the film is an incredibly enjoyable movie. W&G have a wonderful way of taking ridiculously stupid humor and outlandish ideas, and making it all somehow seem intelligent and witty. The screenwriters have succeeded in transferring that balance to the full-length mode.Wallace & Gromit run a pest removal business that is currently very busy considering the locals need extra protection to ensure that their vegetables aren't destroyed before the ""biggest vegetable"" competition. Wallace, being an animal lover, specializes in capturing garden-intruding rabbits and giving them a home.However, when he tries to alter the rabbits' minds to stop their constant veggie cravings... a mishap occurs. I won't spoil the further development, but they make for a lot of fun stupid confusion.What works so well in this film is the constant outpouring of outlandish imagination. It realizes it can't rest on the pathos and inner-personalities of it's characters and so it places all it's focus right where it belongs... in stupid humor, fast paced action, and visual creativity.Unfortunately, in the last twenty minutes it all becomes a little too much and a little too predictable. However, With an abundance of it's best parts... and a constantly funny leading duo, WALLACE & GROMIT hits enough high notes to make for a really great time nonetheless.... B+ ..."
174,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,24 February 2006,Very funny and brilliantly executed.,"The first big screen outing for Wallace and Gromit proves to be a thoroughly enjoyable romp  chock full of sharp jokes, engaging characters and wonderful animation.Our heroes are in business together as pest controllers, ridding the town of unwanted vermin  in particular, the rabbits that are attacking the townsfolks' prize vegetables! Of course, Wallace is too kind to actually 'off' the toothy critters, so he keeps them in his basement. During an attempt to brainwash the rabbits into disliking vegetables, something goes terribly wrong and the terror of the Were Rabbit is unwittingly unleashed.This film is fantastic. My 4 year-old daughter enjoyed the silly slapstick humour and I loved the quirky little in-jokes, the occasional touch of 'adult' humour carefully concealed amongst the wacky goings-on, AND the silly slapstick humour.The film has so many nice little touches that repeat viewings are a must!"
175,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,22 February 2006,"Great message, great film...","It's always comforting to see a film that still portrays the main character(s)as being genuinely wholesome human beings. This film shows the economically hardship of a small English community whom relies on the annual vegetable growing festival to help gain attention and respect for their agricultural skills in their own backyard gardens. The only problem is that the small town is being terrorized by small rabbits, stealing and destroying all the vegetables in the garden. But with the help of a gentle middle aged Englishman by the name of Wallace and his K-9 best friend, Grommit, the two of them run an ""anti-pest-o"" business that puts the community at ease, knowing that their vegetables are protected from just a phone call away. On their off time, Wallace and Gromit has a house full of invention with the intent of changing the world for the better. After an experiment with a mind altering machine gone wrong with Grommit and one the rabbits, Grommit is then transformed into a ""were-rabbit,"" at the sign of a full moon, and then terrorizes the community days before the festival.The film has the elements of good moral decision making on part of the characters. When Wallace and Grommit capture rabbits, instead of getting rid of them, they take them in and take care of them, feeding them providing shelter. It's as if they understand that the rabbits are only stealing food because that is their natural instinct of survival and they take them in to there own home to care for their natural behavior. It seems as if they also tackle the issue of man playing God and the repercussions of the actions. With wholesome comedy that delivers well and intense action sequences, that even I began at one point biting my nails, this film is not only enjoyable to families, but to anybody that is looking for an uplifting, good moral film that leaves you feeling good when you go to sleep at night."
176,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,22 February 2006,AWESOME movie!,"Having little knowledge about Wallace and Gromit from past experience, I was not sure what to expect going into this movie. However, it was discount day at the theater, I had my two little girls with me, and Daddy was going to be late getting home from work. I have to say, this was the best $20 I've spent going to the movies! My girls, ages 3 and 5 were glued to the screen with great big eyes. The smiles on their faces were classic. As for me, I laughed out loud several times, along with the rest of the adults in the theater. This movie is PERFECT for the entire family to enjoy. There are a couple of parts that the humor is definitely suited for adults, but it goes right over the children's' heads. I will definitely be buying this when it comes out on DVD!"
177,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,21 February 2006,Watch for cinema staff- a sign a greatness,"I was working in a cinema when this came out and it was easily the best film out at the time. Although some of the foreign staff said it was ""too English"" they were all amazed at the length of time it took to actually make the film.Incidentally if you want to see how good a film is keep an eye out for the staff, if they just pop their Head around the door its not very good. However if they proceed to have their lunch the film is good. (You have no idea how many times we see a film if we eat our lunch in it, it must be good.)Easily one of the best British films ever. On a par with the legendary Monty Piton films? Definitely."
178,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,20 February 2006,A great and humorous work of gentle genius,"I may up this movie to a vote of 10 if I watch it enough. Suffice it to say I gave it a 9, since it's an amazing production done in intricate and ""realistic"" claymation that renders the ""everyday"" world of a suburban British neighbourhood fully, allowing the craziness of animation to erupt while gently satirizing the thoroughly British ""types"" that populate the area, and telling a very funny story.If you know of Wallace the inventor and cheese-lover (who gives real meaning to the word ""nerd"") and Gromit, his great and faithful canine friend, then you know that Wallace's fantastic inventions -- which somehow always manage to spin out of control -- fuel story lines that are mildly demented, with a hint of the ""dark side"" thrown in, and Gromit, who can emote volumes without so much as barking, generally saves the day.This story revolves around the upcoming vegetable-growing contest and fete to take place at the local manor owned by Lady Toppington (voiced by Helena Bonham-Carter). The Lady, who is a vegetarian animal-lover and no mean hand at growing giant vegetables herself, is involved with a suitor, an impoverished nobleman and Snidely Whiplash sort of character (voiced by Ralph Fiennes) who wants to marry into the Lady's money. Moreover, there is a plague of rabbits in the suburban gardens and on the Manor lands, so Wallace and Gromit's pest-control company is quite busy in the neighbourhood and thus the tale unfolds.The daft story about a Frankenrabbit generates a long, continuous feast of claymation eye-candy, with non-stop visual and verbal gags, and the film does not hesitate to satirize films, styles, and clichés.A great, superbly produced and lovingly directed film for any age."
179,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,20 February 2006,It was great,I mean going into the theaters i had some pretty high expectations. I love all the other films...they are so family oriented...it gives me time to spend with my children...When i walked into the theaters and the film started rolling I laughed the entire time. It was fantastic. That fact that it is clay makes it funnier. Its a funny concept that clay can make you laugh. I felt like I was a child again seeing Mary Poppins. I would advise every one to see it. It is already out on DVD and I know that I will be buying it that day. Its a film you can watch over and over again. Everyone and anyone should see this if they want to bond with their children. Its that fantastic. Its not a waste of your money at all.
180,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,15 February 2006,Cheese Gromit!,"This movie was brilliant, when i watched this film i had goosebumps swimming around my stomach, it was a priceless film, i enjoyed it so much.I have never seen an animating team work so hard, 3 seconds a day working on this film, Corpse Bride managed to finish a lot quicker, maybe thats because some of the edges and some of the bits in that film was a little sloppish.But this film definitely broke the mole for stop motion animation, this is superbly the best animation film of 2005 and the best British animation of all time, even though Chicken Run was fantastic, it cant match up to Nick Parks classic Wallace and Gromit.So if your in for fun and laughter watch this and enjoy! 9/10"
181,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,14 February 2006,The magic of plasticine,"It's rare these days to find an animated film that can please both a 5-year-old girl and her 20-year-old babysitter. This film, the latest installment in the adventures of the cheese-loving Wallace and his long-suffering pooch, pulls it off with style and class. The plot is basic enough and silly enough for the kids, and the filmmakers throw in enough asides and throwaway remarks to keep the adults' attention. (Read the sticker on the box Wallace finds himself wearing at one point.) The only downside to a movie like this is that it might take the creators another five years to produce the next adventure. Good things come to those who wait, I guess."
182,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,13 February 2006,"Gromit, don't forget the cheese!","I am a rather large fan of the Wallace and Gromit shorts, so I've been looking forward to this for a while. Why it's even taken me this long to get around to it is beyond me, but I'm glad I finally did.The thing about Wallace and Gromit is that it's amazingly inventive and expressive, especially as concerns the character of Gromit. Think about it for a moment... Gromit doesn't speak. He has no lines. He's a little clay puppet. And yet every look Gromit makes, you understand exactly what's going through his mind.Now what worried me a bit about this full-length adventure is that, since there were going to be a whole lot more characters and stuff going on, the movie might get off track from that whole point. And to a certain level, it did kind of get a little more kooky. However, it's still spectacularly silly fun that you can't help but love.The only thing that really hurts this movie is the ending, which was kind of unexplained and cheesy (though cheese is, afterall, the delicacy to these characters, so maybe that was just another one of those fabulous puns?). However, for a movie that's rated G, seems so obviously childish in appearances, and has cute little bunnies to boot, it's important to not lose track of the overall craft of the work! There's even little things, like the angel wings/devil's horns in the church, the allusions to many different classic horror films and other works, the characters, and the real sense of mystery and fun packed into it, that just can't be ignored. If most children's entertainment held itself to this standard, it would never be so tiresome.--PolarisDiB"
183,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,13 February 2006,"If you loved the previous Wallace and Gromit films, you'll love this.","""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" manages to incorporate almost every classic horror monster of the 20th century in its spoof: Frankenstein, the Werewolf, Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, and King Kong are all combined into the horrible, veggie eating Were-Rabbit. ""Were-Rabbit"" follows Park's tried and true formula of a slow, slightly comic beginning building up to a ridiculously over the top ending punctuated by the most obvious of puns: and the more obvious, the punnier they are.Lovers of Park's previous work won't be disappointed. Parks uses a few old tricks but in completely new ways, and as usual, the fact that a joke is -expected- in a Nick Park film makes the joke that much funnier."
184,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,13 February 2006,in Twenty Five Years Time This Movie Will Become A Classic. I Would Bet My Life On It That It Will Become A Classic.,"This movie has everything you want. Funny thing is the people who watch it don't understand it's classic moments. I mean, northerners preparing for the one and only vegetable carnival. What's more vulnerable than that? It was actually very interesting to see northerners and what they're like. Funny thing is they cared about nothing else but their vegetables. People who hate this movie have something wrong with them. It seems to me that the people who hate this movie are the ones who are stupid and don't come up with good explanations to say why it's bad. This movie is everyone. Took them 6 years to do this movie. There aren't many people out there who hate it either. Seriously, watch it. I recommend it to everyone. It's a classic. A Were-Rabbit attacking a vegetable carnival? Come on, that's original. Things that are in this movie have never been done before. Such as a Were-Rabbit, a vegetable carnival, northerners, an old virgin trying to get along with a girl who's taken by Victor. All those things have never been done before. Great movie. See it now!"
185,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,18 December 2005,"A Sweet, Hilarious Adventure For Wallace and Gromit!","Every once in a while, there is a classic way of filming renewed for a generation of younglings. People take filming techniques that have been used for decades, rejuvinate them, and instill in them a heart that is both touching and entertaining to children and adults alike. And this is what Curse of the Were-Rabbit is: taking stop motion animation and introducing it to a younger generation in a delightful, animated comedy.What is so atypical about this feature is instead of the dog making the mistakes and the man cleaning up after him, the roles instead are switched. Wallace is the human inventor, an intelligent, if somewhat dimwitted figure who is obsessed with cheese, and is the founder of Anti-Pesto, which is a pest control squad run by himself and his beloved dog, Gromit. Gromit, on the other hand, is a sort of motherly figure, always watching out for Wallace as he partakes on his crazy experiments, taking care of the house, and protecting him from harm as best he can. He is a lovable, sense filled, four legged friend that you can not help but fall in love with as he cleans up after Wallace.I walked into the theatre completely oblivious to who Wallace and Gromit were before this theatrical release, yet I knew within the first few minutes that I was going to love this film. The introduction has Wallace and Gromit not speaking a word, instead allowing the audience adjust to their world of pest control inventions. Wallace has invented a way for him to get ready in the mornings without using a muscle, instead creating various slides and robotic arms to make him breakfast, dress him in his work clothes, and pop him in his car. Gromit, in perhaps the most unique role of any animated animal I've seen, uses nothing but facial and body expressions to convey his words. Just thinking of a few golden moments in this film brings a smile to my face, ones I won't spoil so you can soak up his brilliant silent comedic movements. Curse of the Were Rabbit is a film to be loved by children and adults alike. Children will marvel at the dim wittedness of Wallace and the charms of Gromit, while adults will bellow in the intelligence of the script and be surprised at the amount of laughs this gem contains. This is what great animation longs to be, yet so often fails. Highly Recommended"
186,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,12 December 2005,Joyful Visual Invention and Clever Storytelling Drive the Latest Park Concoction,"It's been a scant sixteen years since Nick Park introduced us to his intrepid characters - befuddled inventor Wallace and his stoic dog, Gromit, in the now comparatively primitive short, ""A Grand Day Out"". Yet, Park and his collaborators - Steve Box, who also co-directed, as well as Bob Baker and Mark Burton - continue to astound with their meticulous craftsmanship, expansive imagination, coherent and clever storytelling and mostly a genuine love for the characters and the eccentric world in which they live. Both ""The Wrong Trousers"" and ""A Close Shave"" had similar set-ups to this feature-length film with a nefarious villain lurking about and Gromit ingeniously commandeering a nick-of-time chase finale. The consistent structure is perhaps the only predictable element of this wonderful film.This time, Park and company tweak the notion of a werewolf movie with a gigantic rabbit that terrorizes an English village in its ravenous search for over-sized vegetables. In the dark of night, it lays waste to the neighborhood gardens, and all the stock characters come out to theorize about its origins and next move, including a skeptical, test tube-headed policeman and a Sam Jaffe-like vicar who spouts all kinds of mumbo-jumbo about the beast within. Wallace and Gromit are now running a new business aptly named Anti-Pesto, based on yet another of Wallace's wacky machines, the Bun-Vac 6000, which literally sucks invasive rabbits out of their holes in a humane, cruelty-free way. They run an especially booming business in a community obsessed with the upcoming 517th Annual Giant Vegetable Competition.The contest sponsor and bestower of the prized Golden Carrot, Lady Campanula Tottington, is intent on using the services of Anti-Pesto to have the beast humanely removed before the competition. However, complicating matters is her caddish, toupee-challenged suitor, Victor Quartermaine, determined to destroy not only the rabbit but Wallace once his affections for Lady Tottington become known. The material is rich with smartly observed parody replete with cheeky references to ""King Kong"", ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park"", as well as the Hammer horror pictures of the sixties and the Ealing comedies of the fifties. Peter Sallis' voice as Wallace is becoming as familiar as Mel Blanc's as Bugs Bunny, and his pixilated tone brings a welcome note of consistency to the production. He is joined by Ralph Fiennes, who has never been so animated as he is as Quartermaine, and Helena Bonham-Carter almost unrecognizably upper-crust as Lady Tottington.No Wallace and Gromit adventure would be complete without the creators' weakness for puns - cheese lover Wallace's library contains book titles such as ""East of Edam"", ""Fromage to Eternity"" and ""Brie Encounter""; there's a jar of Middle Age Spread in the kitchen; and a naked Wallace covers his privates with a candy box with the telling label, ""May Contain Nuts"". All of this is clever, but the real magic of the film comes from the fact that such mercurial facial expressions and fluid bodily movements can be made painstakingly from clay and wood. Somehow it all feels more vital and alive than anything from a computer. You can even see fingerprints on the models, a touch that curiously makes the characters even more magical. Even with no voice to call his own, Gromit is an amazing creation with just his stuffed-animal eyes and furrowed brow. There is an unfettered joy in watching the unerring visual invention show up with each new movie adventure, and I am happy to report that the newest installment is further proof of the magic they make out of their meticulously molded love and care."
187,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,10 December 2005,You need to watch it more than once,"May be it was just me, but please forgive I watched this on an overnight flight on a airline TV screen, but you need to see this film more than once just to spot the running jokes all the way through. But that's OK because you'll want to watch it more than once because it's so funny - especially all of the little running jokes...Ralph Fiennes is hilarious as Victor Quartermaine and Helena Bonham Carter voices Lady Tottington superbly. But as ever the animation makes this so funny. I was surprised how well it worked at 90 minutes but they keep it going all the way through.A dead cert for the animation Oscar - Nick get a new bow-tie ready!"
188,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,4 December 2005,"""A gold bullet... 24 karat!""","Inspired by the classic stop-motion animated shorts, ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is a richly rewarding treat for all ages. Inventor Wallace and his mute dog, Gromit, are inventors who run a successful and ""humane"" rabbit-catching business. After vacuuming up the adorable pests in an upper-class woman's lawn, Wallace gets the idea of conditioning the bunnies to resist the temptations of vegetables through brain-washing...unfortunately, the inventor's plan backfires, and panic ensues as the town prepares for a produce-themed contest/carnival. The animation is seamless, unique, and inventive, giving flashier CGI offerings a run for their money; the humor is just as sharp, ranging from gags simplistic enough for children, to more subtle bits that adults will appreciate. A fine achievement in animation and one of the year's best films."
189,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,30 November 2005,A cartoon for adults which kids will also enjoy,"Like the marvelous short Wallace & Gromit animated films that preceded it, ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is a cartoon for adults which the kids will probably also enjoy. The humor will be over the heads of small children -- from certain of the sight gags to the whimsical by-play (a shelf of books with cheeses in their titles like ""East of Edam""; Wallace's passion is cheese of all kinds). Wallace & Gromit are in humane pest control in this movie (their firm is called ""Anti-Pesto) and their quarry is rabbits who threaten the annual Golden Carrot festival for the best vegetables grown in the vicinity of Lady Tottingham's estate (Helena Bonham Carter). Ralph Fiennes is the ineffable Victor Quartermaine, a suitor for the wealthy Lady Tottingham's hand. I won't ruin the film for anyone by going through all the complications but, as always, Wallace (Peter Sallis) and his silent pet, Gromit, get into no end of trouble but eventually save the day. Stay on for the rolling of the credits which have some lovely sight gags going on behind them."
190,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,28 November 2005,Laughter and tears are in store for all in this new Wallace and Gromit classic!,"This film really exceeded my expectations. As someone who has practically been raised on Wallace and Gromit I must admit that I was a little apprehensive about going to see this film. No prequel could possibly be as good as the originals especially as this was a special extended addition... or so I thought. As it turned out I think that this is by far the best yet. I laughed, I cried from laughing too hard, I cried because I was so moved by the end. For those of you who haven't get seen this you really must. Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is not just for children or those who are already a fan, it's also the perfect introduction to anyone who hasn't yet seen anything of Wallace and Gromit and just how funny they really are! I just hope that this isn't the last we see of them!"
191,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,23 November 2005,Nick Park saves the cheese again...,"I can't think of a cuter pair of animated characters. Wallace and Gromit are among my favorite. Nick Park has a one of a kind talent that surpasses all of the contemporary animation directors I know. He gives us characters that make us laugh and genuinely cry. Drama does not come easy in a cartoon visualized world but Nick Park pulls it off with his innocence and sensitivity. What else makes Wallace and Gromit films special is their odd sense of storytelling. We can see how the stories get carried away to such bizarre levels. Audiences might ask from time to time ""how did they come up with that?"" I believe the magic of Park's creative ideas relies heavily on his traditional stop motion approach. Creating a film with that type of technique forces the animators to take directions they did not exactly predict. A move might go somewhere else and once it is shot, it has to keep going. When that happens, new ideas come up that are infinitely more interesting then the ideas that are preconceived on paper and designed on the computer. I am so happy Nick Park made another Wallace and Gromit and I am even more happy that there are still animators working today that don't use computers. This film proves how authentic this style of animation really is. I highly recommend this film."
192,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,21 November 2005,Another Nick Park Classic,"Forget the Madagasca Penguins, the short film that started the show - they were OK, but the main feature was excellent. Be prepared to laugh out loud. Its a typical horror story, written to be acceptable to young children. There's all the usual things that you find in a W&G story, but put you film memory into gear and see how many gags you can spot. The characters may have finger print outlines on their faces once or twice, by this type of production is just a thousand times better than animation, no matter how good that may be.Go and see it, buy the DVD (for me please!). This is in the same league as Chicken Run, or is it better - we'll just have to wait and see."
193,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,15 November 2005,if you love the movie....,"I thought this movie was the most ""originaly funny"" movie that i have seen in a while.Like for instance take hutch the rabbit who is Wallace in bunny form wears sweaters and is in love with cheese!just like him.that makes me want a ""bunny""clone of myself without the love of cheese,and the part near the end when Wallace comes to after returning to his normal self and he's naked and gromit gives him a barrel to put over himself and on the front of it it says may contain nuts.there's acouple of little things like that hidden in the movie for adults to catch by the way.Plus it reminds me of when i was growingup watching other Wallace and gromit shows. Like the close shave(95)and the wrongpants(93)they use to show on nickelodeon.so i got to love it.I would also recommend seeing chicken run though.It's made by the same people who made Wallace and gromit."
194,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,14 November 2005,A Great Parody of the Old Were-Wolf Movies,"Wallace and his faithful dog Gromit run a pest-control company which uses high-tech inventions as burglar alarms to summon them to gardens where rabbits have broken in and are eating the vegetables. The stakes are high, as the 500th Annual Vegetable Growing Contest is about to take place and the townspeople have grown huge pumpkins, carrots and other vegetables to compete in the contest. They fear that the rabbits will eat their prize vegetables before the contest takes place.Wallace and Gromit do not kill the rabbits they have captured. Instead, they put them into pens and feed them. However, the problem is that the pens are full, so they seek another solution. Meanwhile, Lady Trottington, who is running the contest, has a suitor who seeks permission to shoot the beasts.The next part of the movie cannot be fully appreciated unless one has seen the old were-wolf movies starring Lon Chaney Jr., such as The Wolf Man (1941). Wallace has invented a mind altering machine. When the moon is full, the machine will alter the minds of everybody attached to it. Since Wallace loves cheese, he attaches himself and a rabbit he has captured to the machine. The plan is that the rabbit will now love cheese instead of vegetables and therefore can be released without endangering the gardens.The machine seems to work as the rabbit no longer loves carrots but loves cheese instead and is therefore released. What Wallace does not realize is that he has created a giant were-rabbit, who goes through the town eating all the gardens. Now, as in the old Lon Chaney movies, the townspeople gather with pitchforks and torches, trying to kill the were-rabbit to save their gardens before the vegetable growing contest. Where is the Were-rabbit and how can Wallace and Gromit stop him? This is a great movie. My four year old daughter loves it. Transfixed, she watched the whole thing twice. I did not understand the movie at first and that is the reason why I am writing this description.Sam Sloan"
195,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,13 November 2005,Nick Park delivers!,"Wallace and Gromit have been one of my favorite duos in animation. Certainly there have been many Man and Dog duos, both live action and animated, but these 2 just deliver the best presentation due to the wit and cleverness of the characters. If you are not already familiar with the characters from their previous 3 short films, then here are 2 brief Bios.Wallace is an inventor who isn't necessarily mad, nor smart. He invents things in principle of using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. He also loves cheese and crackers, his true passion. He loves his pooch Gromit, even though he is a bit dis considerate of him, not respecting him enough.Gromit never says a word. Not a bark nor growl. The only way he communicates is by eyebrows and hand gestures. But this is enough to understand his mood in every scene.The actual movie is about this annual Vegetable Competition that all townspeople are part of. But unfortunately there are many rabbits running rampant, eating all of the vegetables. Luckily, Wallace and Gromit work as humane exterminators, and they keep them all at home. In an attempt to take care of the storage space, Wallace uses a brainwashing device that is supposed to remove the rabbits taste in vegetables. This is were all Heck brakes loose. A mighty and huge rabbit runs rampant, wrecking havoc among everybody's gardens. So its up to Wallace and Gromit to hinder the beasts actions in a humane way.The animation is superb, containing many elaborate scenes, with beautiful crafted puppets, and well directed scenes, the movie does not disappoint. The only negativity can be found in that you can see many fingerprints on the characters after they had been handled. Music is nothing special, consisting of their theme song and some newly composed music. But it gets the job done, fitting the mood and style of the whole movie.In the end, this is a movie that is great for any age, from the young ones to the old ones. It has many double meanings, but few should be noticed by the young, and most should give the older ones some fun. This is a must see movie for the whole family. 9/10!"
196,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,12 November 2005,"Excellent, don't miss this.","I absolutely loved this film. I've been following all of Nick Park's work on Wallace and Gromit since their first adventure close to 15 years ago. I think this adventure surpasses the original Wallace & Gromit's, ""The Wrong Trousers"", and makes that classic my second favorite in his work to date. For non stop action enduring a full 90 minutes it surpasses any of his earlier works.I took my just turned 6 y/o Grand-daughter yesterday during a school holiday and we absolutely loved it. Great animation, great storyline, just so many little goings on in the background to elicit a non stop giggle. But, I think a lot of the little details were a bit over her head and those of several other young children, as their parents seemed to be the one's laughing and giggling the most.Strongly recommended. My congratulations to Nick Park for another all time classic in the medium only he can create this well."
197,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,11 November 2005,Very entertaining,"This movie manages to keep the wonderful charm of these two lovely characters while developing a entertaining and funny story. However the last 15/10 minutes almost spoil the whole movie, those frantic chasings with fast movements and succession of gags one after another to give that ""final fireworks"" impression is commonly used in other animation movies but it doesn't fit in this one. The plot keeps you really interested during all the movie and the output is quite unexpected. The effects are amazing, it's hard to believe they made it all with their hands (in some parts you can see the fingerprints in Wallace's mouth!). A shorter length would have benefited this film, specially cutting some of the final parts."
198,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,10 November 2005,job well done lad,"The quintessential English animation classic,this has Oscar written all over it. Wallaces canine companion steals the show,silent throughout but expressing more than words could ever say with a rolling of the eyes or the raising of an eyebrow.All the voices are superb but Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the scheming Victor Quartermaine is unsurpassed. The script is word perfect and the dialogue a delight. I know quality is worth waiting for but five years is a long time to wait before we see these characters on the big screen again .If they insist on plasticine employ more staff and lets make this a annual production. A feelgood film that engulfs you in its innocence and charm leaving you with a warm glow and a knowing smile.Would like to give it ten but that would be too self indulgent so 9.9 will suffice.With all the dross that masquerades as cinematic entertainment it is nice to know that craftsmanship is still alive and well. Job well done lad."
199,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,10 November 2005,Wallace and Gromit do it again.,"Just as Wallace is crackers about cheese, so am I about this movie. I've seen it 13 times to date and having seen it so much I get a great kick out of the audience's reaction to it. I know when the laughs are coming and wait for them to respond.What I like is the detail of both the characters and sets. The mottling of the brickwork for instance and the facial expressions are quite good and make the characters more life like. The film shows the eccentricities of the British people and how obsessive they can become about such things as having the biggest vegetables to exhibit for example. But who can resist the appealing Gromit."
200,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,6 November 2005,Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of Dreamworks,"Nick Park's reputation as a stop action animator, using flexible plasticine figures for his characters, was made on the basis of three short films - released between 1989 and 1995 - featuring the team of Wallace, a bumbling inventor with a voracious appetite for cheese, and his faithful dog Gromit, who, though he never utters a sound, in fact provides the brains to extricate his master and himself from various predicaments. Now, bankrolled by Dreamworks, Park and his team have created a feature length film for the intrepid adventurers.Rabbits are devouring every carrot and melon in the countryside, shortly before the annual competition for best vege awards. Wallace and Gromit are on hand as humane pest controllers (d.b.a. Anti-Pesto) who use various preventive gadgets created by Wallace to avoid actually killing any creatures. Through the misapplication of one of Wallace's crazy contraptions, he becomes inhabited by the identity of a monstrous rabbit, a fiend that is unleashed at night when the moon rises, complete with fur, rabbit ears and a huge body. Meek and amnesic by day as Wallace, at night he morphs into the fearsome rabbit, galloping through the land eating veges, destroying property and terrorizing the population. Of course it's up to Gromit to figure out a way to restore Wallace to his senses and reign in some other villains in the process.The action is absorbing enough, the animation is first rate, and sly homages abound. There's the spoof of the werewolf theme, of course, and also a scene reminiscent of Faye Wray in King Kong's clutches climbing up a tall building. (Ms. Wray, incidentally, died near her 97th birthday last year.) Bugs Bunny is honored (with his famous ""What's Up, Doc?"" line) and even Eminem receives tribute with the line, ""Run, Rabbit, Run,"" the title of one of his hits, or is an allusion to John Updike's novel, ""Rabbit, Run""? Whatever.The point is that, amidst all the action of this big, busy, smart flick, the essence - the soul - of the earlier Wallace & Gromit material has gone missing. Vegetables aren't the only things being pilfered here: the quiet, quaint Britishness (the heroes often peacefully hanging out at home) that made the short W & G films so endearing has also been stolen, replaced by all of these Americanisms.Gromit might not agree, but I suspect that the culprits behind this dastardly theft are none other than executive producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and his Dreamworks people. Wait, you say, for Katzenberg also produced Park's first stop action feature length film, ""Chicken Run,"" in 2000, and that was a very good film indeed (I certainly thought it was). Ah, but that film's characters and themes arose sui generis, without a body of earlier short works against which to compare them. And ""Chicken Run"" wasn't about Britishness: it was an allegory in which a chicken farm stood for a forced labor camp.""Were-Rabbit"" is a good enough movie, but I find it impossible to resist comparing it with its predecessors. I can't bring myself to judge it exclusively on its own merits, and so I see this film as another among countless examples of the corrupting influence of American Big Moviedom. My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+) (Seen on 10/09/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites."
201,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,7 November 2005,Enjoyable but long,"The Curse of the Were-Rabbit was thoroughly enjoyable, but it was certainly a bit long.I am a huge fan the 3 original Wallace and Gromit animated shorts (A Grand Day Out, A Close Shave, and The Wrong Trousers) as well as Nick Park's first feature length film, Chicken Run. Fans like myself are sure to love this movie.However, I did think that there was a lot of filler in it to stretch it out to an hour and a half, so it could be billed as a feature film. The same story could probably have been done as a 30 minute short but then they would have been limited to alternative distribution methods.This movie will be in my DVD collection, but my recommendation for non-Nick Park fans is to wait and rent it."
202,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,6 November 2005,great movie - who caught the Haggard reference?,"Hello everyone.I am wondering who else caught the reference to H. Rider Haggard's ""hero"" Allan Quartermain, changed to Lord Victor Quartermain? And isn't his voice the same actor who plays Lord Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire? (Ralph Fiennes.My partner and I both really enjoyed the movie. I was thinking that now that they have the ability to look and change every single frame they can sneak in all those lovely details and satire.So, who thinks that the comments from the vicar about changing nature referred to stem cell research? Karen March"
203,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,6 November 2005,A quality family film with an imaginative story line,"Walice and Gromit are known throughout all ages, known for their spectacular characters and smooth flowing animation. The two hero's hit the big screen in this new family comedy. Curse of the Were-Rabit is their first feature length film after creating big laughs with A Close Shave and A Grand Day Out. The amazing animation and hilarious jokes are sure to capture its audiences laughs and imagination. I have never been the biggest fan of Walice and Gromit, sure i've seen A Grand Day Out and The Wrong trousers, but they never appealed to me as i was growing up. I was rather young to understand the humour and in many of their films they have small jokes that no one notices. And yet this film reminded me of my child hood and sitting with my family watching these types of films. Even if your opinion of the film is that it had bad directing, or a poor quality script - It still, on some level, must have reminded you of your child hood. Sure I'm young now and will be for another decade or so, but this film brought me back to some memories i had forgotten. This film has decent funny characters and contained memories of people the creators had never even met.Highly recommended for all ages and anyone who wants a quality humoured film."
204,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,5 November 2005,"Fun, but I still prefer Creature Comforts","The first feature length outing for Wallace and Gromit sees them in the vegetable-protection industry. As AntiPesto they specialise in keeping the village's prized vegetables safe from the ever hungry mouths of rabbits. In a humane manner. The Annual Giant Vegetable Show is only a few days away when the Were-Rabbit makes an appearance. Destruction of many much-loved vegetables occurs, and AntiPesto also have to deal with Victor Quartermaine who believes that the gun would be much more useful in dealing with the problem than any of Wallace's methods.Through in a bit of a love story, not to mention a weight loss problem, and you've got the essence of this film's plot. And anyone who hasn't seen any of Park's previous work may be surprised at exactly how much plasticine can convey.This is a really enjoyable film. There is plenty of humour to keep you smiling, and at only 85 mins even the younger children should be able to sit through it without too much trouble.There are plenty of allusions to other films, especially were-wolf ones. And we've get our first homage to King Kong though I'm guessing that Jackson's one will be slightly longer.There is also a short before the main feature, starring the penguins from Madagascar. I didn't hugely enjoy that film, but the penguins were great, and here they are just as funny."
205,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,3 November 2005,A movie with feelings and to see if that person has a heart or not.,"I went to see this movie with my friends and I must say I was very impressed. It's a great flick and a very cute movie. It's basically a kids movie. But not only is it a kids movie it's trying to see if you have a heart or not. It's a very cute movie which will touch your heart. It's very hilarious and has excellent direction.The clay animation is absolutely brilliant! The clay animation is even better than ""The NightMare Before Christmas"", in fact, it's better than any clay animation movie ever created. Took them 6 years to make this movie. And just after they finished the movie their factory burnt down. Wouldn't it have been awful if it burnt down just before they finished making the movie? Anyway, be that is it may. The movie was excellent. I recommend this movie to anyone in the world. If you hate this movie than you have no feelings and can't accept a heart."
206,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,3 November 2005,An absolute scream!,"Wallace and Grommit's first full length feature is a must see for all. The film is funny on all levels with even a few adult jokes added for good measure. A brilliant inventive script that parodies horror films doesn't disappoint. Fast paced, the comedy doesn't let down with in-jokes to Thunderbirds and ""An American Werewolf"", and a supporting cast of eccentric villagers, all eager to protect their prized veggies from being eaten by the local wildlife. But as with the short films, Grommit steals the show with his super-expressive face which says more than words ever could. He is run a close second by the Wallace-like rabbit Hutch (who becomes a cheese loving inventor, after a ill-fated experiment by Wallace who also suffers ""bizzare"" symptoms as a result). Hopefully this is not the last full length feature for the plasticine duo. This film must be a favourite for next years Oscars."
207,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,2 November 2005,The best wallace & gromit yet!,"Anyone who has seen a Wallace & Gromit film before, or Chicken Run even, will now what to expect from Nick Park. This film doesn't disappoint.A masterpiece full of great gags, subtle (and not-so-subtle) puns, and tributes to sci-fi/horror classics such as Frankenstein & King Kong.In short, plans for the local village's harvest fête and prize vegetable competition are cast into doubt when a new menacing pest begins stalking the vegetable patches and allotments of the would-be winners. Who or what is responsible for the damage? Can Anti-Pesto (Wallace & Gromits pest control business) catch the strange new beast? Will Wallace win the girl?I recommend you take a bit of time to watch this film and find out."
208,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,29 October 2005,Oooh I do like a bit of Wallace and Gromit,"Wallace and Gromit. The pair has been adored by the British nation since they first arrived on our TV screens in the early 90s. Wallace, the cheese-loving eccentric inventor and his genius canine companion who never says a word are the 'pair that started it all' for director Nick Park, director of Chicken Run and three times Oscar-winner. This movie is the first ever full-length Wallace and Gromit film, and it certainly will not disappoint fans of the duo. The movie expands on the local neighbourhood of West Wallaby Street and beyond, introducing new characters never before seen, notably PC Mackintosh voiced by the British comic legend Peter Kay, and reverend Clement Hedges voiced by Are You Being Served's Nicholas Smith. However, the two star names and star performances are Helena Bonham Carter as the vegetable-mad aristocrat and new love interest for Wallace, Lady Tottington, and the brilliantly versatile Ralph Fiennes as the baddie, the 'no-nonsense' huntsman Victor Quartermaine. The key to all Aardman films and their distinctly British humour is to always watch what is happening in the background  this film is no exception. The film gets funnier every time you watch it as you always spot new meanings in what the characters are doing, what they're standing in front of, or how they're positioned. Aardman fully deserve another Oscar with this hilarious spoof-filled outing. Better than Chicken Run, they only continue to improve. Enjoyable for all ages."
209,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,28 October 2005,Extremely good fun!,"It is really amazing what a dedicated team of animators can create! I've been a big fan of Wallace & Gromit since watching ""A Grand Day Out"" and the stories and plots just keep getting better. To finally have a feature length film with surprising twists and turns (and lots of hopping!) is a treat. Watching it just once will not be enough because so much care has been taken with even the smallest details (remember the ""interesting"" book titles?) and you just don't see them all in one sitting.If you need a very good laugh, go to the cinema and watch the film!Enjoy!"
210,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,28 October 2005,great family entertainment,"Finding a movie which my parents, my kids, my wife and I all enjoy is nearly impossible. Strangely, 007 movies and Austin Powers movies have been the only movies so far to keep everyone's attention, however they are often inappropriate for the boys.The notion of competitive gardening and the threat of pests introduced early in the movie connected with everyone in the group. Humanely treating the growing population of captured rabbits presents an interesting conundrum. The characters were well drawn and familiar, our minister hums ""all good gifts around us"" much the same way as Wallace's minister. The action had a pace which kept everyone sitting forward and the comedy kept them grinning.I have always been a stop motion animation fan and still have a super-8 camera which I used for animation years back. I appreciate what hard work each frame is. Nick Park and company have made a movie which indulges both the artists and the audience. So I can share my appreciation of this art form with those I love."
211,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,27 October 2005,"Wonderfully inventive and hugely enjoyable, Park does it again - 83%","I seem to be one of the few people who thinks that Nick Park is one of cinema's most under-rated directors. Few have had the enormous success he has enjoyed over the years with his almost trademarked clay animation technique. From the early days of the ""Sledgehammer"" video for Peter Gabriel, it was clear that Park's unique vision was a treat for viewers and ultimately led him to this, the big-screen debut of Park's most famous creations. Wallace and his long-suffering dog Gromit have had a long and successful run in small-screen short films (winning Oscars, don't forget) and finally, they have been granted their first feature film and although I suspect Park and his team won't want to hear this, pray that they spend another five years making a second.In case you're new to this cult, allow me to induct you. Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) is a lonely inventor living in the north of England with his faithful canine companion, Gromit. They have developed a small business called Anti-Pesto which rids the locals of troublesome (and very cute) bunnies that are putting the annual Giant Vegetable competition at risk. But when reports of a giant were-rabbit begin to surface, the beautiful Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter) must decide which way is the best to save her competition - the humane capture by Anti-Pesto or the somewhat more violent approach by trigger-happy villain Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes). As the battle for the beast begins, it seems that a bitter love rivalry between Victor and Wallace threatens to boil over into all-out war.Watching this, it's easy to forget how painstaking it was to actually make. Given that only three seconds of film were shot each day, it's not surprising that it took five years to make ""Wallace & Gromit in The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit"". Thankfully, it has lost none of it's charm as fingerprints are still visible on character's faces and it still has that wonderfully old-skool look, no matter how polished the picture is. The humour has also lost none of its impact and like all good comedies, there is as much going on in the background as there is in the fore. You'd need to watch it several times to catch everything and at times, it is laugh-out-loud funny. Sallis IS Wallace and his gentle, unassuming voice was born for the role of the eccentric, hapless hero. And although he never says a word, Gromit's facial movements provide a perfect partner to Wallace's childish enthusiasm. It is also much better than Park's earlier feature film ""Chicken Run"" in that it's just as enjoyable for adults as it is for children. And given how good ""Chicken Run"" was, it isn't surprising that ""Wallace & Gromit"" scores as highly as it has.However, I do have a couple of minor gripes. There is some CGI detectable for the first time (first time they've used it) and many characters seem surplus to requirements. I also feel that the story wasn't strong enough to last the distance and many scenes were reminiscent of earlier outings. For example, the first scene where the rabbits are running amok in the house as Gromit desperately tries to fix dinner reminded me of ""A Close Shave"" where sheep are doing the same. But like I said, these are minor quibbles at best and certainly nothing to ruin my enjoyment of what is one of the best family films I've seen for years. I haven't enjoyed a film this much since I saw ""The Incredibles"" and if this doesn't get Park the recognition he richly deserves then something is seriously wrong with the world. Cracking!"
212,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,24 October 2005,Well Stewed,"WALLACE & GROMIT IN THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT By Steve Box & Nick ParkThe small farming town where this fair story takes place is home to good, peaceful folk who spend the majority of their time and energy attending to their prize-winning vegetable gardens in preparation for the annual vegetable harvest festival. They are simple people with simple values like hard work, community and being humane to all creatures. Perhaps the same can be said for ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" creators Steve Box and Nick Park. Years of dedication and attention were required to assemble this first feature for the Academy- Award-winning characters of Wallace and Gromit and this film highlights similar themes to Park's previous claymation feature, ""Chicken Run"", like being kind to all the animals. However, choosing all the right vegetables does not a great stew make. Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) is a goofy, awkward, good-natured fellow who owns and operates his own security company to protect the villagers' prize vegetables along with the help of his reliable and crafty dog, Gromit. They are always successful, always humane and always admired until the appearance of the Were-Rabbit (a giant freak cross between a rabbit and a werewolf). It is their mission to save the vegetables so that the festival can go on as planned. Without this festival, these people will have nothing  There's a lot hanging on Wallace and Gromit's heads. Lady Tottington (voiced by Helena Bonham Carter) is Wallace's potential love interest and her persistent suitor, Victor Quartermaine (voiced by Ralph Fiennes) acts as the counterpoint to Wallace's humane approach to pest control by insisting that violence is the only way to effectively attack their problem.It's a solid story with solid characters and some solid laughs but ""The Curse of the Were- Rabbit"" is about as exciting as well, a vegetable festival in a small town. I first wondered if perhaps I had not tried to see the film through the intended audience's eyes. After all, it's colorful, the characters are enjoyable (in fact, Gromit is downright endearing) and there are sporadic moments of excitement and laughter. Then I noticed that none of the children in the audience seemed to be having very much fun either. Without trying to sound extremely cliché, the film lacked heart and today's kids (this larger one included) didn't bring theirs from home to make up for what was lacking. B-"
213,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,1,16 October 2005,Just NOT funny...,"I was very excited to find someone who wanted to see ""Wallace and Gromet"" the movie, with me. I had laughed so hard I almost wet my pants over the shorts (the evil penguin and the wrong pants) but OMG - The (Were Rabbit) movie was not funny! Primarily, it lacks the comedic timing that the shorts had honed to painful perfection. This movie has no subtlety. No sneaky surprises. Not even any really creative elements. The funniest thing was Lady Tottington's crazy hair-do and the decorations that changed with each shot. But that grew old really fast. And the movie sports a gigantic plot hole. Wallace is restored at the end but his brain-swap with the Were Rabbit seems not to have been reversed at the same time. What gives with that? Not for adults. I say only funny for 9 years and under. Even 9 year olds might squirm with disinterest. What happened? Did someone run out of juice? Is that why it took 5 years? It seems to be a waste of voice talent. and time and money. At least I saw it as a bargain matinée (in exotic Angels Camp) so not a complete loss."
214,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,3 October 2005,Surely the Worst Marketed Film Ever?,"OK, I'll admit upfront that I'm slightly biased, being a long time fan of Wallace and Gromit.Like many fans of the fantastic duo, I feel a passionate desire to tell all my friends that they have to go see this film. But even now, with fantastic reviews appearing and a seemingly guaranteed best animated Oscar, I get a kind of puzzled look - they just aren't sold on it.And why? I think, because the marketing about this film has been appalling. Not like I know what the marketing should be, but surely the reason Aardman got into bed with DreamWorks was to deliver the best possible platform for their films. Ever get the feeling the marketing department don't understand the product; or the market? Well, I for one, will be going and I hope the film is the success it serves to be."
215,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,17 October 2005,"Make it shorter, I'll buy it","Like many folks, I loved the Wallace and Gromit shorts. I especially thought ""The Wrong Trousers"" was a stroke of brilliance. It went in so many different, unpredictable directions in a short amount of time.That's what was missing from this movie, I felt. The formula-based story was a shock to me, and I was waiting the entire movie for a twist, or at least something odd.I struggled with the length of the movie in terms of the story - it didn't support 1 hour 40 minutes. I would have preferred a shorter 1 hour story and perhaps 2 shorter 20 minute deals.Technically, Wallace and Gromit had a lot of the charming attention to detail that you would come to expect from Nick Park. Seeing it on the big screen really made the fingerprints stand out, especially on Gromit. But who cares? It's plasticine, after all. For me, it's always refreshing to see a stop-motion film. It's all tangible and real, from the sets to the props to the characters and special effects. Plus, it can be real fun to watch for the tricks."
216,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,5,12 December 2005,"Closer than some, but still not quite there...","I was arguably too old for this film, so many of the jokes were kind of lost on me. It's probably quite funny. Some of the humor was diverse enough to make me laugh, though. The plot is pretty simple and somewhat predictably written(though I must admit, part of it is pretty darn original). Of course, that is really for the best... it is, at least to some extent, a children's film. It holds some attempts at spoofing other films. Not all are successful, but a few of them are quite amusing. The pacing could have been better, it felt like it moved just a tad too slow. The acting is solid. The characters are well-written, though a few of them are too clichéd. Most of the gags and jokes didn't really work for me, but I guess it just wasn't my kind of humor. There were a few truly golden lines and scenes, though. The animation is state-of-the-art. I didn't care all that much for the humor in the film, but I have to admit that the clay-mation looked great. The only real problem with this film(providing that whoever watches it is into the humor) is really the direction and pacing. This was directed by animators, not a director, meaning that they knew how to make the clay move and work on-screen, but didn't know how to create tension or pace it properly. That hurts the film a bit, more than anything else, really. Pretty good film, but somewhat slow and less well-directed than it could have been. I recommend this to fans of the two characters as well as anyone who enjoys the humor. 5/10"
217,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,5 January 2006,"Good, but Far from Great.","While I enjoyed the film, I have no interest in seeing it again for a while. Frankly, towards the end, I was getting tired of the constant in-your-face jokes. The beauty of the shorts is their brilliant British subtlety. While there was a lot of humorous detail to appreciate in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, there is very little subtlety left that isn't marred by a forced joke towards the finale.The silent-but-deadly archenemy part of the Wallace & Gromit equation was sorely missing. In all the shorts, the antagonist has been utterly silent, and that was part of the charm. While Ralph Fiennes's voice acting is superb, I can't help but think that his part ruined the film for me.While I would give the original Wallace & Gromit shorts 9s and 10s, I award this film a 7.PS: There is a ridiculous amount of the plot that revolves around killing men and animals with guns for this to have a G rating. Small children will see a lot of violence on the screen (fighting and shooting) while missing a lot of what makes the movie funny. Guide them to flickering images elsewhere.. they won't know the difference."
218,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,9 October 2005,Wallace & Gromit's first full length movie!,"This is Wallace and Gromit's first full length movie. And it's about time too! Unlike the 3 original shorts. this one is longer and has more people in it than just Wallace himself.Has everything you'd find in any Wallace and Gromit including Inventions, an unusual incident/new thing happening, and of course cheese.The story involves a big Vegtable Contest held at Lady Tollorence's place. All the Vegtable Owners own ""Wallace and Gromit's Pest-O Control Security"" on them. Wallace and Gromit make sure that all the Vegtables are safe from Rabbits. But when a mysterious WereRabbit comes out of no where the whole situation becomes a big and furry problem. It contains many British Voice talents. Ralph Fiennes plays the main bad guy. And Helena Boham Carter(one of my favorite actresses) plays the main female character.There's lots of laughs and plenty of gags in it. Even has spoofs from ""WolfMan"" ""King Kong"" and ""Jurrasic Park"". Please know some parts in the film contain a few naughty jokes, such as seeing someones but, and and some other things that look inapropriate.It's a G rated movie so you can let anyone of all ages to see this film.If you're a die hard Wallace and Gromit Fan. Then see this movie! It's great and awesome to watch. You won't be disappointed. And it's something to buy on DVD too."
219,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,9 October 2005,Wonderfully entertaining movie,"I went to see this movie yesterday afternoon. I can describe it in one word: HILARIOUS! It was quite funny. I saw Ebert and Roeper almost an hour ago, and they, unfortunately, split. Ebert liked it, Roeper did not. I agree with Ebert. This movie had quite a lot of humor. You were laughing at something every 5 minutes. The only reason I can't give it ten stars is because they revealed the secret a little too soon. I won't give it away, but I will tell you that you wouldn't expect it. Wallace is quite funny, and Gromit is quite smart. Smarter than Wallace, I think. And most people would probably agree with me. All in all, a great movie for kids of all ages, and adults will find it equally enjoyable."
220,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,8 October 2005,Heavens Above!  This is Wicked Funny!,"Hats off to Aardman studios for the best W&G yet. I went to the Saturday matinée, complete with the requisite gaggle of giggly kids and their haggard parents, yet I was the one getting ""shushed"" by A CHILD, I was laughing that much... The animation is very well-done, with applaudable attention to detail. Fabulous casting with Helena Bonham-Carter as Lady Tottington, Ralph Fiennes as Victor, and the perfect Peter Sallis as Wallace. Add to the mix a brilliant score, spectacular sets, and (finally!) 80 blessed minutes of run time!So, yes, extremely funny, with the trademark sprinkles of grown-up humor (nothing inappropriate, though) interspersed with the ever hilarious escapades of our favorite cheese-loving, finger-waggling, eye-rolling duo."
221,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,7 October 2005,Fun for all ages!,"I was not very familiar with Wallace and Gromit before this and now they have a complete fan in me. I took my younger sister to see the opening of the film and I was laughing harder and louder than she was. It has plenty of humor, both child and mildly adult, but is never disrespectful and a sweet nature that makes it rather endearing. Helena Bonam Carter was magnificent as the eccentric Lady Tottington and the entire cast of townsfolk added hilarity to the entire film. This was a great film and I hope there is more to come from the W & G team. I would recommend this film to anyone, not just to those with children or those who enjoy ""British Humor"". Job well done."
222,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,7 October 2005,A definite MUST SEE!,"I can't remember the last time I fell so head-over-heels in love with a movie! ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" was my first experience with Wallace & Gromit, as I have never seen one of their shorts..but I am HOOKED! The wonderful, original storyline, the over exaggerated features of the characters, the colors, the scenes---GENIUS. And down right HILARIOUS! I am much impressed with the technical side of this movie. The painstaking process of 5 years of work it took to make--it was well worth the effort! Please know that this movie is not just for kids. Parents that take their kids will probably get more enjoyment out of it, as some of the humor will fly over kids heads. Nick Park, in my opinion, has a masterpiece on his hands & a bona fide Oscar."
223,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,5,10 October 2005,"The annual giant vegetable competition is underway, . But there's a problem. Something seems to be attacking all the vegetables,but the anti-pesto, are soon on the job","Although the animation, and graphics of the movie are truly astounding, the movie somehow, does not have the same zest as the original series of ""Wallace and Grommitt."" The storyline is not very well done, taking quite a long time before getting into any action. If you are looking for some laughs, you won't find many, except for the odd one, here and there. The only thing that keeps this movie going, is the truly amazing picture, and almost real life picture of ""Wallace and Gromit:curse of the were-Rabbit,"" but besides that it is a bit of a disappointment, overall.The movie is not all it is cracked up to be, and has failed its expectations. Overall, the plot is a letdown. There are a few funny one-liners, here and there, but besides this, the movie is a disappointment"
224,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,1,12 September 2006,Disappointing and not funny,"Why are so many people rating this so highly?!? Can't you people remember what Wallace and Gromit used to be like!?!As soon as I'd finished watching this I had to rush home and re-watch the previous two adventures, just to restore the balance in my head of where W&G lie on the scale of quality film making! Back in ""The Wrong Trousers"" and ""A Close Shave"" things were done very differently: characters' personalities weren't dumbed-down and overly-simplified to appeal to the moronic mass market and humour was a lot more subtle...and FUNNY! The older films were incredibly good at creating a compelling atmosphere (with such short time-frames!) This film had me pleading for the end very early on. Worst of all, back in the previous works there were scenes with such exquisite build-up of action - layer upon layer of excitement crafted so beautifully that it made me want to hug people! Curse of the Were-Rabbit falls so far short of generating these emotions within me, I may have to conclude once and for all that there is no God!...and the sex jokes???????"
225,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,4,9 October 2005,"If you liked the first two, don't go to this one","I don't understand the praise for this feature movie version of Wallace and Gromit, having been so enthralled by the sheer innovation, ingenuity, and satire of the prior shorts. Unlike its predecessors, the script of Were-Rabbit is not in the least original consisting rather of motifs from clichés of classic horror movies. Even worse, it relentlessly panders to the tastes of children. As a child's feature, it may be wonderful. Clearly, however, what's here is merely what's come of somebody with a lot of money having bought a brand merely to refresh the same old formulas. A very big disappointment for one who had expected very little more than very little more from the original efforts."
226,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,18 October 2005,I love W&G... but...,"I am rating this movie a 6 out of total respect for the craft of this movie, and its visual perfection in an agonizing production process. I also love the characters and their innocence. It's nice to have a movie where you can just sit back with the family and chuckle a little bit and not have to worry about violence or death (a frequent Disney/Harry Potter/Lemony Snickets etc issue).This movie is cute and fun.However... Our family were HUGE fans of the earlier W&G half-hour movies, especially The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave. I went with my wife and twin 7 year-old boys with high hopes. They LOVED those earlier movies and we saw them many times. IN COMPARISON, I found this movie... slow and bland. It lacks the frenetic, intense pace of the shorter films. It also seemed as if it lost something with the perfection. Those earlier films had a choppiness to them, and an imperfection that added to the experience. In movie form, everything was so POLISHED that it took away from the feeling of chaos, conflict and comic danger. Also, and this may be a significant part of our disappointment - the story and character development were off. The love interest was bland, and we've seen her before with the owner of the yarn shop from A Close Shave (a much more interesting character, I thought). The hunter was also bland and only mildly amusing. Silly and stupid, and not a real threat at all, especially when compared to much more interesting and intelligent villains as The Penguin (The Wrong Trousers) and the evil dog (A Close Shave).Do I respect this movie and what it represents? ABSOLUTELY!!! Did our family laugh out loud throughout the movie, and walk out of the theater saying ""that was great, we have to see it again!!"".... Sadly, the answer is NO.I believe many of the reviews of this movie are based on sheer respect of its art... yet if one is honest, one may find themselves wishing for a better storyline, characters and conflict.My opinion, nothing more."
227,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,5,18 October 2005,"Cute, satisfying, and slightly disappointing","This movie was cute. It satisfied the great demand for a Wallace and Gromit movie. However, this movie reeks of big wig Hollywood involvement. One of the great things about The wrong trousers was that it was mainly focused on Wallace and Gromit. There was very little involvement of the townspeople. The fun was the fact that Wallace was a complete bumbling idiot who could not invent to save his life. The wrong trousers was a unique story that revitalized the claymation genre. This story has been done to death. I felt like I was watching sections of King Kong, Jumanji, and Gumby all mixed into to one. Wallace and Gromit are more suited to shorts. After about twenty minutes they loose their mystique and interest. I know that a lot of people talk about the references to those movies but if the makers of Wallace and Gromit had to resort to cheap pops (fan response) tactics perhaps they were not ready to make a full length feature film."
228,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,7 October 2005,"Cute Movie, Great for Kids!  (A Review from the US)","When I read the reviews on this, nearly all of them were from across the pond. I know American and British tastes can be different, so I wanted to post an opinion from an American's POV.Now, keep in mind that we got to see a sneak preview of this movie at a packed theater - for FREE. How much money is sunk into seeing a movie can sometimes taint how I feel about a movie. Since the only thing we bought was a small popcorn, it's hard to feel ripped off.I will also preface this by saying I'm not much of a Wallace & Gromit fan. I've seen one or two of the previous films, and they were all right, but not really my ""cup of tea."" This was an enjoyable, fun movie. Several belly laughs, and I can't say I felt bored at any time. Our two children, ages 3 and 5, LOVED IT. Our 5 year old asked if we were going to be buying the movie. The 3 year old barely fidgeted at all (which says a lot!). As many others have commented, the bunnies are really cute, and the expressions on the faces of the characters are uncannily descriptive.One other note is that I can't think of anything in the movie that would make a parent uncomfortable for their kids to see. The language was very clean. There were a couple of references that were a little saucy and aimed for the adults, but I think they would go over most youngsters heads.Give me Pixar any day, but I still had a good time. And yes, we will probably buy it on DVD when it comes out."
229,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,20 September 2005,A Cracking Film,"I just saw this film and was so pleased that it lived up to the expectations that are had with Wallace and Gromit. The plot, while thin, was still clever, and it was just pure fun on the cinema with English charm and humour. You can't beat watching Gromit as he pulls off some clever stunt, or having Wallace pull off his various catchphrases. Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter were good, but couldn't top Peter Sallis or a mute dog, whose looks alone said more than words. Nick Park's ability to transfer his and the world's two favourite Northener's has been pulled off superbly, resulting in a film that comes off better than Chicken Run, and with just as much charm and entertainment as the three original shorts."
230,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,5,2 November 2005,Bit of a disappointment,"The movie was OK, but i had hoped for so much more. The animation was pretty good (for example the bunnies looked great in some scenes), and i suppose the plot was also pretty well thought out. But for some reason it just failed to hold my attention. At some points in the movie it became a drag to watch.This is the first movie in a few years that i saw at the cinema where i was messing about more with my GF instead of paying attention the whole time (and i go to about 80 movies a year at the cinema per year). I think that says enough seeing as how I'm usually in trance watching movies at the cinema. Could just be that I'm just not a big fan of clay animation of this kind tho.But for people who enjoyed ""chicken run"" and those who like movies with a lot of subtle (and a lot of not so subtle) winks at other classic movies, this movie can be highly recommended."
231,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,10 October 2005,Austin Movie Show review,"Even before the film begins, you get the added treat of enjoying a 10-minute short film starring the ""Penguins"" from Madagascar. It's nothing spectacular, but it's cute. The real magic, however, starts with the opening credits of Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The clay-mation is superb and the story is absolutely enchanting. It reminded me of the old stop-motion and clay-mation Christmas movies that I adored as a kid.In the film, Wallace and his faithful dog Gromit are best-control agents who protect their clients' vegetable gardens from pesky rabbits. But they're not exterminators. They humanely deal with animals, never harming a single varmint. Wallace, the savvy inventor that he is, connects his brain with that of a rabbit in an effort to ""rehabilitate"" the rabbit and keep it from eating other people's vegetables. In the process, they switch brains, and the were-rabbit is born. Now it's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the village vegetable show from a giant and savage rabbit.Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is simply too cute for words. It was never dull and even funnier than I expected. I may have enjoyed it, but the kids in the theater were having the time of their lives!"
232,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,14 May 2007,For the Family!,"It's 'vege-mania' in Wallace and Gromit's neighborhood, and our two enterprising chums are cashing in with their humane pest-control outfit, ""Anti-Pesto."" With only days to go before the annual Giant Vegetable Competition, business is booming, but Wallace & Gromit are finding out that running a ""humane"" pest control outfit has its drawbacks as their West Wallaby Street home fills to the brim with captive rabbits. Suddenly, a huge, mysterious, veg-ravaging ""beast"" begins attacking the town's sacred vegetable plots at night, and the competition hostess, Lady Tottington, commissions Anti-Pesto to catch it and save the day.I was never fond of the series of Wallace and Gromit, because it didn't ""connect"" with me. I knew this film would be good but it started off slow. I really wasn't interested in anything but as the film goes on, it picks up and picks up and picks up. It will make you watch until the ending!I also need to point out that there are many cultural references to this film, but I'm not from the UK so I couldn't spot many of them. Most notable is the King Kong scene, just like another film I've just seen: Flushed Away. This film has twists and turns, leaving the movie really unpredictable and it's also good for adults as it's good for kids.There are even some funny jokes in the film with some light heartedness. It's a harmless film and might probably the best animated film of 2005. Wait, that (in my opinion), is for Shrek 2, so this one is a runner up. You'll also love the lovable characters.Children might like the film, adults may want to sit through it if they have some heart left in them. It's funny, witty, imaginative, unpredictable, etc. That's one good film!"
233,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,19 November 2006,Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit,"Wallace & Gromit has always been the phenomenon that eluded me. Every once in awhile I would be flipping channels and come across a short on BBC, but never took the time to actually watch one completely. When the film came out last year it seemed cute enough, however, the lauded praise and fanfare was surprising to me, as well as the Oscar (granted Pixar was MIA in 2005). Finally I was able to catch up with the animated feature and upon completion I must say first impressions were correct. Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit is an enjoyable little film that doesn't break any ground in storytelling, but is a feat of construction. Unfortunately in this case the wonderful visuals can't overcome a lackluster plot.Aardman definitely has inventive minds at work for them. The characters are all well fleshed out and nicely orchestrated. Each voice is original and cartoony in a good way. Almost like a vaudeville performance, the script is read articulately and showy. Even the name actors like Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter are unrecognizable in their roles. This performance style helps greatly in creating the atmosphere desired with the movie. The animation is a big factor as well with facial features becoming distorted for every emotion. Just the ability to have Gromit the dog be articulate and understandable in stop motion animation, while never uttering a sound, is amazing. Craftsmanship astounds at every turn.Where the film falls flat is in the material being portrayed. The allusions are amusing with references to Beauty and the Beast and Frankenstein, among many others, yet the gleaning from other sources soon becomes a bit tedious to the point where you know where the story is headed. With a plot progression as telegraphed as this one, I started to feel a bit restless as the really funny parts became too staggered to keep my interest. Yes the visual puns are great most times, (the angel wings and devil horns in the meeting scene), the hidden text a delight, (the car's window sticker, the cheese box label, the radio buttons), however, the sexual innuendoes got old and finally just elicited groans rather than chuckles. I almost feel the film would have been more successful either by going full-blown British and adult, or strictly child-driven without the crassness. Instead I feel the brilliant artistic merits are overshadowed by a mixed bag of gags and confused overall feel that never finds its way. Perhaps the switch to feature length created a need for filler in its almost 90 minute runtime, and hopefully when I get a chance to check out the shorts I will experience a tighter storyline and more enjoyable pieces of work."
234,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,23 April 2006,And here's to Stinking Bishop!,"Talk about endorphins! The latest masterwork from Nick Park and Steve Box, less than an hour and a half long, contains more jokes than are countable, or seemingly even possible-- you'll keep giggling for hours past the running time. In this one, the ever-ingratiating Wallace and Gromit turn their considerable ingenuity to humane pest control, saving the local village (and its cherished Giant Vegetable Competition) from the ravages of rabbits. At the bequest of Lady Tottington (possessor of Helena Bonham Carter's voice and a great cloud-bank of orange hair) Wallace undertakes the rehabilitation of his captured bunnies, using an untested brainwashing technique. Needless to say, this goes disastrously wrong, unleashing a gigantic were-rabbit to terrorize the community.Park, like Wallace, loves complexity, and the visual gags are so layered that watching the movie only once would be a crime. He references innumerable earlier movies throughout, ranging from Jaws to American Werewolf in London to Yellow Submarine. (My favorite: the song that plays when Gromit turns on the radio.) Peter Sallis, as always, shines as Wallace (trust Dreamworks to suggest replacing him!) and the vocal characterizations all around are wonderful, particularly Fiennes's ripely ridiculous Victor Quartermaine. Gromit, of course, needs no words. What a great dog. Sheer magnificent entertainment."
235,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,17 March 2006,Superb,"I think Wallace and Gromit - Curse of the were rabbit is the best thing since sliced bread. I know that I am only 14. But I know what I love, and I love this. Anybody considering buying this film should go right on and buy it. It's fab. Superb. I WONT spoil the plot for anyone but it really is a cracker. Wallace and Gromit have been around for a long time and Nick Park is an unbelievable man. Where would the world be without him. This film should get all the awards it's nominated for. Anyone who disagrees must be dead. The humour. Wallace = the goofy mad inventor. Gromit = The mute best friend. I think that everybody can see a bit of either Wallace or Gromit in them. Give it a few years and this film and all it's memorabilia will be worth hundreds. I just hope the rumours about the sequel are true. But since this film took about 5 years (I think) to make, don't plan on the sequel being here in a hurry. But even if it does take another 5 years to make the sequel, by which time I will be, what, 21, I will go and see it, even if I do get the nick name ""That weirdo in the back"", because I think everyone, you might not admit it, but everyone will want to see it."
236,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,25 February 2006,A classic.  It's a classic right here this very moment.,"This movie is a classic. Northerners growing their lovely vegetables. Classic. I mean, look at every single movie compared to this one. There haven't been any other original/classic movies lately, except for this one. I mean, you have disgusting sex jokes in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", a clichéd love story in ""Wedding Crashers."" This one is the best one. And even better, both kids and adults can relate to it. I mean, name 1 film where kids and adults love. Definitely not The 40 Year Old Virgin or Wedding Crashers. Maybe Corpse Bride, but it wasn't as charming as this movie. This movie will be known as a classic.I don't know 1 person that hates this movie. It has so many jokes in there that just cracked me up. I recommend it to anyone. 10/10"
237,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,16 February 2006,"""Turner and Hooch"", the best family animated film since 03's ""Finding Nemo"", animation at it's best","***1/2 Voices of: Peter Sallis, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter. Directed by Steve Box and Nick ParkAfter Dreamworkds and Pixar studios did 2003's ""Finding Nemo"" and then attempting to top it with ""Madagascar"" or ""Shark Tale"", all animated movies have fallen far from it. ""Wallace and Gromit"" thankfully save and fill the void of animation or Dalmatian. Every hand crafted scene delightfully delivers a warm tale of a dog and his owner. Brilliant inventor Wallace (Sallis) and his playful pooch Gromit who work for Anti-Pesto are in charge of lowering the rabbits population for the vegetable competition. And when Lady Tottington (Carter)'s rabbit problem gets out of hand she calls the duo to take care of business. Although her so called boyfriend Victor Quartermaine(Fiennes) may get the best of Wallace and his dog Gromit. Wallace's new invention may take care of the bunny problem for good, but might one up the inventor himself. And it's up to Gromit to save the day and his master. ""Wallace and Gromit"" are a dynamic duo, the two combine perfectly to resemble classic duos ""Oliver and Hardy"" or ""Abbot and Costello"". A great taste in British-Dalmatian family fun, one of the years most enjoyable movies. My final rating 9/10"
238,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,9 February 2006,"An endearing, exceptionally entertaining product of love and sweat.","It's plain to see that lots of love (and sweat) went into ""The Curse of The Were-Rabbit"" because it clicks from frame one. The scripting is tight, the characters are perfectly realized, the jokes are clever and relentless, and the visuals are beautiful. Wallace and Gromit, who run an extermination business, accidentally create a monster rabbit while engaged in the questionable process of ""re-educating"" rabbits about the benefits of stealing produce. The rabbit threatens an upcoming vegetable festival in which giant vegetables compete for prizes like mutts at a dog show. The visual and aural execution of the above is breezy and effortless. The makers achieve an easy balance of both British and a broader sense of eccentric, quirky humor that is totally consistent with their world view. It's not a film of spectacular set pieces like ""The Incredibles"", but it has a unique tone and is never less than totally endearing."
239,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,19 January 2006,A Cheesy Classic,"A little less inventive than 'A Close Shave' and 'The Wrong Trousers', where film and pop-culture references are crammed into every frame, this is, nonetheless a quite adorable, witty movie. That a little of the visual density of Wallace and Gromit's earlier outings should be lost in expanding their adventures to feature length is inevitable: that concentration of cinema puns would clearly be exhausting. There are affectionate swipes a-plenty (from the Hammer Horror canon, especially), and this suffices. What matters is that Wallace and Gromit, themselves, are the heroes we know of old. Gromit's gloriously expressive features almost defy our knowledge that he's little more than a lump of plasticine. This, of course, is testament to the labour-of-love which these characters represent for Nick Park: blood, sweat and tears have gone into their animation  and it shows. The film's depiction of silly superstitious village folk is made the more amusing by the antics of the Mayor of the Isle of Portland, in Dorset (should really be Norfolk, shouldn't it?)  who has insisted that all posters for the film be torn down on account of 'rabbit' being an unlucky word, locally. Rabbits, we are told, are ne'er mentioned in them there parts, save by the nick-name 'ground-mutton', less ill-fortune fall on the heads o' the townsfolk. Replacement posters have been printed bearing the legend ""There's something Bunny going on!"""
240,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,5 November 2005,I don't think going to the cinema gets better than this,"Even though most of what I want to say has been very ably said before in other reviews I thought I'd get my opinion on record:This is possibly the best film I have ever seen!Why? It conforms to everything I want from film entertainment. It has a plot I find interesting, it has characters I really, really want to know about and care about and who have a genuine and brilliantly observed relationship. It is funny, not just in that mildly amusing way that makes you grin in the cinema, but in the way that caused me to laugh out loud at least four times, and that's something I do very rarely. The humour is warm; it's not sly or cynical nor does it rely on any sort of attack, Wallace might be ridiculous on occasions, but he's never ridiculed.The film is ""rich"", by that I mean that it has layers on layers of amusement, something that used to be called fun for all the family. If there's an obvious gag going on then there are also two other more subtle gags happening. If you don't get one of the gags don't worry there's another one coming along in a second. The comedy is brilliantly timed and builds from small jokes and witticisms to outright laughs and then starts building again.I know that if you're producing between 3-10 seconds of film a day then you should have the time to stuff the film full of jokes and gags, but if you don't care and don't have that core sense of humour then you won't or they won't be funny. Nick Park clearly does care and does have the sense of humour.As for the film quality, well, I think it's utterly brilliant. ""Claymation"" has a quality utterly unlike cartoon or computer animation, there's something ""real"" about it; the characters DO exist.In all just a great piece of film entertainment, I've seen it twice, laughed out loud both times and will definitely be buying the DVD.P.S. Oscars? Oh yes, possibly best actor for Wallace but definitely best supporting actor for Gromit, and maybe Nick Parks will win best director. What do you mean they're not real? Are you stupid? Haven't you seen the film, of course they're real!"
241,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,22 October 2005,A very well done cartoon.,"First, of course I have to review ""Madagascar: Penguins Christmas Capers"".The short starring the war penguins from Madagascar, I thought, was actually a lot better than the pointless and annoying actual film, ""Madagascar"". It dealt with one of the penguins going out to buy the lonely polar bear a gift for Christmas, and the other penguins have to find him. They end up stuck in a house with an old lady and an extremely viscous dog. I actually thought it was pretty well done, and amusing at times, but I didn't actually like most of the penguin's voices.My rating-2 1/2 out of 4 stars. Running time:11 minutes.Now the actual movie.stars: Peter Sallis, Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter.The fourth installment of the Wallace and Grommit adventures and the first full length one turns out to be really great. It deals with Wallace and Grommit and their new bunny catching job (their name is Anti-Pesto). The two go to rich Lady Tottington's house and catch all of her rabbits and Wallace becomes infatuated. He gets so annoyed at how the rabbits are all over, that he uses an invention where the rabbits will have his brain pattern and like cheese and such. Of course, this makes him a were-rabbit and makes another rabbit turn slowly into Wallace. Very good and great animation. Even with that said, this is not my favorite of the cartoons. It is still sweet and great though and I recommend it highly! My rating- 3 1/2 out of 4 stars. Running Length-79 minutes."
242,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,17 October 2005,deus ex Macconais,"Excellent! I was worried that some of the spirit of Wallace and Gromit would be lost or overstretched in the full length movie, but it has survived! It wasn't quite as joyful as A Close Shave, but it certainly kept me happy. The plot isn't particularly deep, but you're not watching it for that: the short films also had eminently guessable ""twists"" to them. There is a slightly disappointing reference to Monterey Jack to please some US investors, no doubt, even though a connoisseur of curdled milk such as Wallace would probably find it quite dull. Punsters will not be disappointed, especially during the climactic scenes, but watch out: the film does conclude with a deus ex Macconais"
243,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,14 October 2005,A sheer job for start to finish.,"The most joyous film I have ever seen. Take the best bits of Shrek, both 1 and 2, and you still don't even come close to the sheer harvest of laughs and homages in this film. And that's not saying Shrek wasn't good, but every single scene in this film has been lovingly crafted, and it shows. The humanity as work in this creation shines through and reminds us that CGI (despite Pixar coming incredibly close - good pun that!) still doesn't have this amount of soul, and one wonders if a computer generated character really ever will capture the humanity of a mute mutt.Long live claymation!!! It's just a pity its such a painstaking process, but I suppose the phrase quality not quantity was made for stuff like this."
244,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,12 October 2005,WALLACE AND GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT is superior family fun,"The Oscar winning shorts headlining inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit are expanded to a feature film in Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The results are a splendidly entertaining 85 minutes of fun, excitement, comedy, and escapism that put most live-action films to shame.Wallace and his canine pal, Gromit, have a thriving business as Anti-Pestos who hunt down and capture rabbits that are eating the vegetable yards of the neighborhood. Meanwhile, Wallace, who is constantly inventing new contraptions and devices, is experimenting with a mind altering machine that will brainwash a rabbit into not wanting veggies. But of course an accident occurs and later, under the full moon, a strange series of attacks by a large, mysterious creature ravages the vegetable gardens of many a neighbor. Meanwhile, Wallace is attracted to a woman, Lady Tottington, whose vegetables are part of the annual Great Vegetable Convention. At the same time, a lecherous man named Victor Quartermaine is on the make for her riches. As the vegetable competition is ready to begin, all the entrants are threatened by the giant veggie eating creature. Who is this strange creature and how can it be stopped? It falls on the loyal, resourceful Gromit to try to save the day even as danger threatens Wallace and the vegetable gathering.Wallace and Gromit remind you of comedians Penn and Teller, where one is a straight man to the other's silent pantomimes. Speaking of Gromit, his character clearly pays homage to the silent characters of Chaplin, Keaton, and even France's Monsieur Hulot. Voice work by Ralph Fiennes (The Constant Gardener) and Helena Bonham Carter (The Corpse Bride) as Victor and Lady Tottington respectively is quite convincing. Although the characters are made from claymation, they take on a life of their own, and pretty soon you forget that you are watching clay and instead care about the characters as if they were real people.Clever puns aside, and there are many of them that whiz by at a steady clip, the sight gags are delightfully amusing and inventive. The humorous situations are never stale or run out of steam but are consistently inspired. The title is a giveaway to the plot as it alludes to the werewolf mythology and the full moon. The transformation that serves as a major plot point is played for laughs and not horrific, Wolfman inspired though it may be. The identity of the creature is a playful parody of every werewolf movie ever made with a nod to such staples as King Kong and Frankenstein. The filmmakers even throw a couple of red herrings to keep you guessing until the big revelation. There are scary moments however, without needing to be graphic or terrifying. All this is from a G-rated film? The pacing is very good and the mood goes from simple comedy to suspense to a hint of romance. Not only is the animation effective with its expressive characters emoting believably, but the overall production is strong even in areas one might not expect in an animated film, namely the cinematography and editing. Even the rousing musical score done by committee is heroically inventive and inspired.Made by the creative team (Directors Steve Box and Nick Park) which scored big on the recent Chicken Run, 'Wallace and Gromit' soars even higher in terms of overall excellence. It works for kids to be sure as the screen is filled with a smorgasbord of colorful and imaginative sets, characters, and effects. What is special is how the film plays for adults in equal measure as the simple storyline is played straight and the jokes are rapid and clever. A great deal of care and time (five years) went into making every scene work, no small feat. This marks another high point this past year in animation as the art form has enjoyed a surge in popularity and creativity. Not only is Wallace and Gromit one of the best animated films of the year (surely giving The Corpse Bride a run for its money), it's one of the best films of 2005. So when is the sequel coming out?"
245,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,12 October 2005,Another Oscar for Nick Park? It has to be.,"I'm English and a fan of Wallace and Gromit. That said I went to see this movie half expecting to be disappointed. With so many awards received and the characters so greatly loved it must be incredibly hard to come up with something new that meets with everyone's expectations.This movie is stupendous! I haven't laughed so much in a very long time. Steve Box and Nick Park have taken Wallace and Gromit to a whole new level. A great plot, wonderful characters (just about every English stereotype that has ever existed), fabulous, intricate detail and witty, multi-level dialogue.The well-loved voice of Peter Sallis brings so much warmth to Wallace. You feel you've known him all your life. It's real, human, touching, daft, daring and hilarious. The other voice actors are wonderful too, each bringing something unique and perfect.I don't wish to sound too critical but I think that Disney could learn a tremendous amount from this film. Their 'you-can-do-it-if-stick-with-your-friends' plots are wearing pretty thin. If I see another movie with a brave-but-broke hero who finds a quirky, wisecracking sidekick to help him win the day (and the girl)... Wallace and Gromit are unique in the annals of animated film history. Disney practically invented the medium and have given us hundreds of wonderful classics, but things have moved on, and this new movie offers far more than sugar-coated characters, one-liners and twinkling stars. It's an exaggerated slice of life, normal everyday life, in all its absurd glory. A reflection of all of us... as true art should be.I absolutely loved it.I had another adult and 5 children with me, ranging from 6 to 16. They can't wait to see it again. At the end of the show there was spontaneous applause. Can you beat that!"
246,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,12 October 2005,"Their Curse, Our Laugh-Fest","I fall into the category of a probable first-timer when it comes to Wallace & Gromit. I'm sure, being a parent who has attended a fair share of animation festivals, I have probably seen them before...somewhere. But, I don't own any of their videos nor was I drawn to the film because I was an ardent fan. That could change, because ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is pure enjoyment from beginning to end, with eye-candy, stop-action claymation, crackling, wry humor, goof-ball characters and, throughout the film, a few subtle, perfectly-timed nods to other films and animators (""King Kong,"" ""Watership Down,"" and, surprisingly, ""South Park,"" to name a few).The ""Were-"" in the story refers to the prefix usually affixed to ""werewolf."" That being said, I need not tell you whose curse W & G are out to overcome. What I do need tell you is that their business is the business of combating garden invaders: animals, specifically. The name of their outfit? ""Anti-Pesto."" It's an outfit that offers ""humane"" pest-control and business is booming. Their clientèle is happy. In fact, the movie opens with the team nabbing a rabbit in a garden, much to the delight of an elderly wacko couple who witness the catch.Gardening in their particular neck of the woods is especially important because all of the neighborhood's inhabitants compete in an once-per-year ""Giant Vegetable Competition"" held at the estate of Lady Tottington. As such, within each inhabitant's garden there are one or two prize-seeking giant vegetables growing. Anti-Pesto's services help to keep the contestants, and their veggies, secure. The story picks up when, to further advance business, Wallace decides to implement a brain-modifier that he hopes to use to brainwash the neighborhood's rabbit population into despising vegetables. Anti-Pesto's work load increases ten-fold when one of Wallace's experiments with that gadget goes awry. The effects of that botched experiment lead W & G directly into pursuit of the vegetable-munching Were-Rabbit.The movie flows flawlessly from one scene to the next, always keeping its direction toward generating laughs while advancing the plot. The show-stopping ""dogfight"" is pure delight, right up there with the best battles between Snoopy and the Red Baron. The stop-action claymation, for me anyway, similar to viewing a Pixar production for the first time, was mind-boggling. Wallace's doughy, toothy face is a spectacle to behold. As for his mute but ever-hilarious sidekick, Gromit, who never fails to issue forth the perfect non-verbal reponse, his mouthless face is dominated by hyper-active eyebrows that bend, arch, dip, and contort to show his constantly changing emotions.I highly recommend the film. It is, indeed, one for all ages. I'm 47. I loved it, laughing out loud repeatedly. The audience at the showing I went to was diverse in age: their laughter was non-stop.Indeed, their curse is truly our delight."
247,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,4,23 October 2005,major disappointment,"I really wanted to enjoy this film and was looking forward to it, but sadly found it a major disappointment. There were some comic moments - I loved the Hammer Horror references, in particular the scene between the crazed vicar and Victor, and the organ music joke - I also liked the 'dogfight', most especially when 'Phillip' produced his pretty purse to pay for the dodgem him and Gromit are driving. There were some other enjoyable moments too, most especially the characterisation of Victor (a great job from Ralph Fiennes) and, of course, Gromit, who is absolutely marvellous in every department, the complete star of the show.What I could not abide however - WALLACE. He drove me up the wall. His inane voice, the same old lines, same old jokes - yes, yes we know he likes cheese for the umpteen hundredth time. And the storyline itself was ridiculous and original in its own way, but not ridiculous and original in a 'funny' way, which is what I had hoped for. The multiple puns were vaguely amusing in a 'Carry On' ooh-er missus kind of way - done better, I should add in the original 'Carry On' ooh-er missus films, or even the first Austin Powers, but not so funny re-trod over and over and over again as it was here. In fact this film was simply too over-loaded with intertextual references across a variety of genres and well-known films, and had also parodied itself, its own characterisations, to the point of self-annihilation. I was desperately seeking smidgens of originality - but they were rare sightings. I really, really couldn't care less about this painfully silly fictitious Northern British pastiche, with its dull fixation for overgrown vegetables. Lady Tottington was carried off with some aplomb by Helena Bonham-Carter and was a sweet lass, but was a ridiculous stereoptype -the posh bird and the 'peasant' is old hat. This film was saying nothing, doing nothing - now this I can handle, and I definitely am a glutton for vicarious enjoyment - but sadly Wallace & Gromit this time fell a long way short here. It was empty and vacuous, saved by the always-brilliant Gromit. The Wrong Trousers is one of my favourite animated films - the evil penguin one of our most pernicious and chilling villains (seriously) - perhaps this film lacked a true baddie?"
248,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,4 October 2005,"Cracking fun, lad!","Only pest-controllers Wallace and Gromit can save the town's annual vegetable show from an invasion of snatching bunnies, but Wallace's scientific tinkering creates a much, much bigger problem...With a heart as big as a prize artichoke, W&G's big-screen debut packs more fun into 85 minutes than Mickey Mouse managed in his entire career. The joy of Nick Park's creation is that it maintains a dry, knowing, and yes, very British sense of humour from the first frame to the last without ever lapsing into cynicism or patronising the younger end of the audience. There's only one kind of cheesy 'message' you'll find here, and it's not of the Disney variety.While referencing monster classics from An American Werewolf In London to Frankenstein and King Kong, the balance of jokes is exceptional, be they verbal or visual, subtle or sledgehammer, adult or juvenile. Many are laugh-out-loud inspired, and the rest ensure that a smile is plastered (plasticined?) all over your face throughout. The candy-floss tumbleweed moment and the garden-tool stall becoming a makeshift outlet for 'Angry Mob' supplies are pure gold.Plaudits must go to the voice cast - especially Helena Bonham-Carter's classy bit of 'Totty', Peter Kay as a particularly forthright copper and, of course, the superb Peter Sallis - but the real stars are Park and his crew of animators and writers. If only live-action comedies were this well conceived - this is a real cracker."
249,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,28 September 2005,The best  W&G,"I have seen this movie twice and each time I've seen it, I've noticed some little pun or joke that I didn't see before. Absolutely hilarious and delightfully cute. If all rabbits looked like these guys, they would no longer be seen as pests. Gromit is his usual, cool headed self, if only I had a Gromit to look after me!! The most appealing part was that I saw the movie with someone who had never seen Wallace and Gromit before (can you imagine?) and they loved it as well. The cinema was full and the people seeing it were middle aged, young, teenagers, all different sorts. It is great to see that a movie like Wallace and Gromit, that appeals to absolutely everyone, and has no gratuitous violence or nudity can still pack them in."
250,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,8 October 2005,Gromit for Best Actor,"Wallace and Gromit run the Anti-Pesto pest control. They protect all the vegetable gardens of the people in the town.I've seen this movie twice I liked it so much. Gromit the dog is adorable. Roger Ebert said if there was a best actor award for an animated character it should go to Gromit and I agree. Gromit the dog is an amazing character. He's really cute and it's astounding how expressive his face can be considering he has no mouth.If you've seen the other Wallace and Gromit features you'll certainly like this one. The story has two very funny supporting characters, Lady Tottingham and Victor Quartermaine voiced by Ralph Fiennes. This is not a Disney kid's movie. It's a witty and sophisticated British satire cloaked in a kid's movie which makes it enjoyable and highly watchable by kids and adults. Even if you don't have kids you can rent this and enjoy it. Gromit for best actor!"
251,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,25 September 2005,Turned out grand again Gromit lad,"SPOILERS It may have been the wrong trousers all those years ago, but Nick Park seems to be growing. ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" might not be the first full length film that Park has created (""Chicken Run""), but it IS the big screen debut of his favourite two characters. Amazingly too, it is a joy to behold. Entertaining and hilarious throughout, this film is a re-finding for many as we remember why we loved these characters so much.There's trouble afoot. Working to protect the prizes of the vegetable growing community, Wallace (Peter Sallis) and Gromit are collecting a large number of rabbits. When one evolves into a monster however, they find themselves forced to set out onto the road again to try to capture the creature before the evil Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes) gets to put bullet holes into it.The one disappointment with 'Were-Rabbit' is that it took so long to come along. Stop motion animation is never a fast process, and as a result we've waited for eons for the finished article. Ultimately though, it was worth the wait.Led by Sallis and an all star support cast (Peter Kay, Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter and others), the adventures of Wallace and Gromit have rarely been this fun.Nick Park, this time helped by relative unknown Steve Box, has a gift. Just like his two main characters, he has this unbelievable charm for creating adorable supporting acts who make you laugh and smile. Just like in 1995's ""A Close Shave"" with Shaun the Sheep, in this film we are given the wonderful new character of Buster the Rabbit. Undergoing a massive transformation, Buster is perhaps the funniest character to have appeared in animation for years. Also voiced by Sallis, he is one of those characters who constantly pleases, and for that, Park has once more done himself proud.It's difficult to know how much more you can praise Nick Park. In possession of amazing wit and intelligence, Park never ceases to spoof major films and series, and he always provides the laughs. Whether his use of full moon to reflect horror, or the exquisite aeroplane chase scene, everything which he creates achieves it's goal with a smile and a laugh. Even his scenes when something truly terrifying is happening, he makes it impossible for you to do anything but laugh by including hilarious sights. Rabbits huddling together in terror, a formerly aggressive dog looking pathetic as he seeks protection. Everything in Park's work has you on the floor in stitches. His characters are like a collection of animated Buster Keaton clones. Often the funniest things are not what is said, but what is done. You miss one joke through laughter, so you catch the next one. The humour is so consistently spread, it's hard to catch your breath most of the time. The film, blatantly, is pure bliss.It's been a long time since rumours were put out about a Wallace and Gromit feature. Such a slow, but beautiful art, stop motion animation is not for those without patience. Luckily though, Nick Park seems to be unstoppable in his quest to provide hilarious entertainment. ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is arguably the finest piece of animation of all time. It's cracking good fun lad and you can eat my Gorgonzola if you don't agree."
252,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,3,29 October 2005,"Close, but missed the mark","I have always loved the Wallace & Gromit shorts but found this movie to be lacking in the writing department. One scene shows Wallace wearing only a cardboard box stamped ""Cheese - May contain nuts"" - a joke, yea. Unfortunately, this was one of the few jokes. This picture relied on its wonderful, cute, characters and amazing claymation to carry it, but it just fell short. There was not enough of a plot and the writing was just not interesting. I found myself falling asleep several times. All and all, lackluster. You'd have to pay me to sit through it again. Maybe I'm getting jaded, but after Toy Story and the first Shrek, which were both so well written, it just seems a shame to spend so much effort on producing eye candy without an equally excellent plot and script. How do the people who produce The Simpsons do it week after week? Sorry to badmouth this effort, but life is too short to waste time seeing this movie."
253,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,11 October 2005,Another disappointment this year,"After Corpse Bride came under my expectations, I was really hoping this would measure up. Unfortunately it seems that this year has been nothing but major disappointments (at least for the movies I wanted to see). The movie centers around Wallace (the inventor) and Grommit (the dog) who run a humane pest control business. They're humanly dealing with rabbits who're destroying the crops of the townspeople right before the giant vegetable contest. Unfortunately, after an attempt to ""re-habilite"" the rabbits, the were-rabbit shows up, and it's up to the pair to catch him. The problems with the movie are many. First the pacing is off. It was a good 20 minutes before anything really important happened (keep in mind the movie is under 1.5 hours long). Second, the movie repeats itself. For example, everyday we see the same inventions used to get Wallace out of bed and get dressed. It's inventive and fun the first time, but it just gets tiresome. Also, the voice acting is uninspired. Wallace is quite likable in the shorts, but a whole feature of the monotone voice acting is boring. Also, there aren't any real laughs in the movie. Instead of witty British humor, or even dumb laughs we get stupid puns (ex. their company is called anti-pesto). The only time i laughed out loud, was out of embarrassment when there was a joke about the ""male parts"". Now obviously it went over the heads of the kids in the audience, but i was uncomfortable seeing that in a kids movie. Make no mistake about it, this is a bad movie that never goes beyond being a cute kids movie. Perhaps Ardman should stick to short films.** out of *****"
254,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,15 October 2005,Hectic pace mostly prevents laughter,"Wallace and Gromit are born winners, but their owner/trainer almost blows it by selling out to hectic Hollywood values in their first feature-length outing.Gnat-sized attention spans are the hallmark of American children, who have been bombarded with TV commercials since they could sit up long enough to watch. Dreamworks imposes on Aardman the crammed agenda the attention-deficient US tot audience apparently requires and the result barely allows a moment for a giggle, let alone a roar of laughter.The detail is charming throughout, but as it rolls it is piled on so thick that you can feel the centuries of man-hours that went into building the picture. Did no one warn Park that his crucial sense of timing was getting pincered between the huge budget and the over-achieving producers' passion for over-egging their puddings? Some of the reviews already posted here mention a desire to see the film again in order to capture gags and details. That's understandable, because the action is so frenetic, but it reflects badly on the picture. Let's hope the next production is self-financed so that it can revert to W&G's original pace and naive charm."
255,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,2 October 2005,A reluctance to be funny,"No chickens in this stop-motion British animated comedy; just an eccentric owner, Wallace (voice of Peter Sallis), of the ""Anti-Pesto"" pest control firm and his mute dog, Gromit (actually has no mouth but exceptionally expressive eyes). Creators Steve Box and Nick Park have a full-length hit on their hands, replete with veggie lovers, British peerage, and two lead characters whose morning wakeup mechanics are worth the price of admission. Relocating rogue rabbits that would ravage gardens is the goal of Anti-Pesto, no doubt to the delight of humanitarians and the dismay of neocons.A big hairy rabbit, apparently transformed by the moon, is stealing the highly-developed vegetables from a community that soon will have a world-class vegetable fair. Wallace's exterminator agency to the rescue. The ensuing chase, a delightful staple of their previous shorts, Wrong Trousers and Close Shave, and occasional movie references (see the were-rabbit carry a lady to the top of a tower pursued by toy planes) offer an often hilarious experience requiring some measure of intellect from its audience as well as a healthy sense of humor. The race for the affections of Lady Tottingham (Helena Bonham Carteralso a heartbreaking voice in Tim Burton's current stop-motion hit, Corpse Bride), by Wallace and Lord Quatermaine (Ralph Fiennes), exceeds all expectations for laughs at Brit peerage.Big hands, big teeth, Brit cheeky self-deprecation and self-satisfaction are the stuff of Wallace and Gromit's loving satire. Oscar Wilde implied Americans might take to them when he noted a century ago, ""English people are far more interested in American barbarism than they are in American civilization."" The stop-animated dolls, no more than a foot tall before being painstakingly photographed for each minuscule movement, have a life-like presence no CGI can replicate. And how that can be when CGI has created eerily human representations (Polar Express for one), is the mystery of the gift Box and Park offer. We are cursed with the genius of a were-rabbit whose big sin is to love vegetables. It's a Whole Foods celebration.E.V. Lucas spoke convincingly of the latent amusement in Brits: ""In England, it is a very dangerous handicap to have a sense of humor."" It's the reluctance to be funny that makes this film and England itself a rich source of satire."
256,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,2,10 October 2005,Don't know what all the talk is about,"I had seen all over the web reviews of this movie, people praising it and saying how great it was that I couldn't wait to go see it. But boy was that a mistake. What really bothered me is that everyone was saying how even grown ups would enjoy this movie, but that's just not true. This movie is childish, sure there are a couple of spicy jokes, but thats just it, there are just a couple and they don't save the film or make it funny. I don't think the film is necessarily bad, I just think it's just a kids' film and people shouldn't promote it as being super hilarious and how everyone can enjoy it. Ultimately I don't think anyone over the age of 12 would enjoy this film."
257,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,7 October 2005,The long awaited (and previously thought non-existent) sequel more than meets expectation!,"When I heard that this movie was coming out I literally jumped for joy. Ever since I was a little girl I have been a major fan of the 'Wallace and Gromit' films, and was one of the many (I'm sure) who were extremely sad to hear that creator Nick Park was not planning on continuing the series after 'A Close Shave' was released. I distinctly remember being upset, believing that I'd never again hear about my favourite cheese loving, crackers inventor, and his lovable, curious and enormously intelligent dog companion. Thank you, Mr. Park, for changing your mind! (Or were you leading us along all the while?) After recently seeing the movie, I was definitely not disappointed. My expectations were more than met, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The script was packed with brilliant humour (some being a little audacious, and some perhaps, seen as corny to others) and retained the same exciting essence of mystery and involved a cunning twist - one of the Saul's in the 'Wallace and Gromit' films. My only disappointment was the replacement of wool-shop owner Wendolene Ramsbottom (who Wallace lost interest in after she revealed she disliked cheese as she was allergic to it) with Lady Campanula Tottington as Wallace's love interest. Although Helena Bonham Carter plays Lady Tottington wonderfully, I could not help missing the gentle, simple character of Wendolene (as in comparison to the somewhat whiney gentlewoman). However though, this slight change does not take any of the goodness away from the storyline. 'The Curse of the Were-Rabbit' is something that both young and old can enjoy, as it embraces the universal concepts of humour, love, irony, mystery, action and even a little horror. Cracking job, Aardman!"
258,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,19 October 2005,Look out for the subtle jokes,"What an excellent movie. My family thoroughly enjoyed it. The plot is an old one and even though the outcome will be known, the intermediate action, dialoge and jokes flow without any problems. The array of characters is overwhelming with some excellent stereotyping. We saw the movie in Buenos Aires where the dialogue was in English with Spanish subtitles. Some of the subtlety was lost but the general reaction was very positive with a lot of the jokes being understood. The audience actually applauded at the end.Unfortunately, I will have to watch the movie another two times at least, to catch all the subtle jokes that are too quick to catch. For example, take a close look at the author of the book that the priest pulls out called The Book of Monsters."
259,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,13 October 2005,"wondrous film, for all the family","Took my little 5 year old to see it today, what a wondrous film, its a great sound to hear a packed cinema laugh out loud, especially the kids, they loved it. I loved the expressions on Gromits face, the whole movie was a treat, now i need to find an excuse to take my neighbours kids ... gotta see this again!! There were loads of adult jokes contained within the film that went over the kids heads, no doubt they will get these when they watch the film again in 10 years or so on DVD. I thought that i would not enjoy the movie as much as i did. Take the time and effort to see this film , it's a classic!! I hear it is currently number 1 in the US box office, I'm delighted that the American audiences have taken this film to there hearts."
260,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,20 September 2005,The long wait is finally over for another Wallace and Gromit but is it worth the wait?,"I say yes. Wallace and Gromit:the cures of the were-rabbit was a bit of a let down because I was really looking forward to it thinking it was going to be great going for 90 minutes but instead the humor wasn't really funny not as good as the others,the story wasn't that good, the jokes were lame and the movie was just to long it bored me.Now that I got the bad points out the good points are the clay animation was excellent the best out of all the other Wallace and gromit movies, the sound was good, it had a big cast which was excellent i thought this was great because normally in the other Wallace and Gromit films it is just them or one or two other people in the film which is hard to keep the audience entertained but they did it well in the other movies.In the latest Wallace and Gromit movie it is a few days before the vegetable competition and Wallace and Gromit run the anti-pesto company which protects everyone in there neighborhood's garden from pest especially the rabbits which are eating everyone vegetables then Wallace comes up with a plan to make the rabbits not want to eat everyones vegetables but will it work? Overall I thought this movie was good but not as good as A Close Shave I recommend this movie to anyone that likes Wallace and Gromit or that clay animation!"
261,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,27 September 2005,movie buffs paradise...may contain spoilers,"This Wallace and Gromit full length movie, was a delight from start to finish. There were no lapses in storytelling, just pure fun all the way. Taking an amazing 5 years to film because of its clay stop animation process, and starring the voices of Ralph Feinnes and Helena Bonham Carter, you could be forgiven if you thought you were in a typical English comedy program or on the set of any one of numerous film Blockbusters. Films like Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Watership Down, Harvey, Thunderbirds, Harry Potter and even King Kong are represented, but it is up to the viewer to spot them. The film might be considered for children, but is directed more for the adult audience enjoying its blend of typical double innuendos British humor and amazing animation. a movie not to be missed."
262,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,16 September 2005,A Grand Night Out,"I had the wonderful fortune of seeing Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit at its special Viacom Gala screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. I was not disappointed.As a long-time W&G fan, I was expecting to be let down. I really didn't think - even though I have a huge amount of respect for Nick Park and all the talented people at Aardman - that they'd be able to create a full-length feature and retain the wonderful atmosphere that makes the man and dog duo so lovable. Boy, was I wrong! Despite the fact that the scale of the Wallace and Gromit ""universe"" is taken to a much greater level with the addition of townspeople and a much more vast array of locations, the movie has still been able to reproduce the characteristics of both the title characters and continue with humour that is suited to every scene.The movie is really a lot of laughs. It's a marvelous technical achievement (as is any stop-motion animated movie), but even more so, it's ridiculously funny. The movie is chock full of great jokes and gags, some that everyone will understand and some that only older audiences will appreciate, but done in a manner so that they'll fly right over younger viewers' heads.If you're anything of a Wallace and Gromit fan, you've got to see this. I really think it's got something for everyone, and I can't wait to see it again!"
263,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,10 September 2005,another work of art,"I enjoyed this movie a lot even though I am coming into my late teenage years. I have to say it's another great film by Nick Park. Just like Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit has a great feel to it. The film is about Wallace & Gromit and the pest control business they run and their hunt for the were-rabbit that is causing havoc in the town from eating their prized fruits & vegetables. You feel for the characters, especially Gromit who ends up doing a lot of the work. Like in the scene when Gromit tries to explain to Wallace who the were-rabbit is and Wallace sits there with a blank look on his face. There are many laughs to be made and for a change they are not over rude and can be entire family can understand, though there are a couple that children may not understand but still it's no crude. Thus keeping the Britishness of the film. Nick Park hasn't let Dreamworks change the film to much, so it still has the qualities of the previous short films. It's great to watch another CG animated film on the big screen. Though Wallace & Gromit may not be as enjoyed in the USA due to the sheer Britishness of the film. With that said I still recommend this film to every as it's something everyone can enjoy and have a few good laughs."
264,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,31 October 2005,Good movie but not that *good*,"Wallace and Gromit the Curse of the Were Rabbit was a well made little movie with sprinkles of humour throughout but i found myself not that enjoyed with it. It was funny in certain parts but there wasn't that much fun to be had with the whole piece. It pretty much zoomed through the entire story in about 80 minutes and left me feeling like this the movie was good, but not good enough to warrant anything like an 8 or above IMDb score. In the end it was a decent movie, but comparatively the Wrong Trousers which was a much more entertaining and enjoyable Wallace and Gromit story. The whole Were Rabbit thing being Wallace was predictable from the get to, was there anyone here who didn't think it was Wallace? After seeing all Wallace and Gromit stories i think in retrospect the Wrong Trousers was a much better crafted piece than this movie. And besides nothing beats the Penguin chase on the toy rail road tracks. But comparisons aside movies should be judged on their own merits, i just didn't think this movie was really that good. Sure it had some jokes and had a bit of fun throughout but it really felt pretty lacklustre in the end for a Wallace and Gromit story."
265,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,8 October 2005,The best family movie since The Incredibles,"After starring in three classic short films, Wallace & Gromit finally make the leap to the big screen. It may have taken 5 years to make the film, but it was worth every second of the wait. The film appeals to everyone, and even though it's rated G, anyone with a love for great movies will find much to appreciate. What the movie proves is you don't need state of the art computer effects to dazzle. What is most important to ANY movie is story and character. There have been so many movies made in the family arena that skate by on computer animation, but have no story to tell. Many are so obsessed with pop culture, that it goes over young kids heads, and will not play to future generations because they will not understand the references. But Wallace & Gromit have a story to tell. And in my opinion it's all the more dazzling because it IS done with claymation. It shows far more creativity and devotion to the movie. But unlike so many ""family"" films, the visuals don't tell the story. The characters do. You can't help but love these characters the INSTANT they come on screen. But the movie is also filled with great jokes, exciting chases, and even a little scare or two. Not to fear parents, they won't bother kids. I have two small kids, and we see many family films. But it's not every time that they enjoy the movies so thoroughly. My 6 year old little girl drove it home when I asked her if she liked it. She said ""I LOVED IT!!"". Even before we were out of the theater she asked if we could buy it when it comes on video. One extra bonus...before the movie we are treated to a short film featuring the penguins from Madagascar. The funny thing is...Madagascar is one of those lackluster family movies I mentioned. The short film, however, is great. Very funny and entertaining. I hope that this movie makes BOATLOADS of money to show Hollywood that computers and effects do not make a movie great. It all begins and ends with characters. And as Roger Ebert put it, ""Wallace & Gromit are in a class by themselves."" Amen, brother!"
266,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,1,23 October 2005,Wallace gone wrong,"Loved the three shorts, but why does Park have to join the bandwagon of demeaning Christians (ie, the minister character). The shorts were fine for my daughter to watch, but I walked out after 30 minutes of this godless creation. I can take a joke, but faith jokes are out of place in claymation.I can't really comment much on the rest of the film, since I didn't see it. The pacing did seem somewhat glacial in the first act. The setup was interesting - Wallace vs. Himself, however I would have liked to see Wallace versus a traditional antagonist. Also, I don't seem to recall a prior mentioning of gardening as a hobby of his - a cheesecake contest would have been more in-character, with giant rats in opposition."
267,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,2,11 November 2005,Where Were the Laughs?,"The makers of this film did remarkable--almost impossible--things in making clay figures become action figures. It's too bad they had no script to put them to use. I was unable to follow the incoherent plot, and I suspect that it didn't really matter if you were charmed and/or amused by everything else in the film. In deciding to see this movie, I violated my policy of reading reviews only to find out plots of movies and was swayed by several reviews that said this was a hilarious film. I didn't laugh once, neither did my wife, and, most important, nobody else in the theater did either. I'll never pay attention to another reviewer.Copyright ©2005 The Press Democrat.

268,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,9 October 2005,"Phenomenal movie, VERY Cheesy (a good thing)","The animation is flawlessly executed, the story is well done, and there are plenty of things for adults and kids to enjoy. The short film featuring the penguins from Madagascar (the only quality characters from that movie) was really funny. If you are a fan of the first three W&G shorts, you'll really appreciate the effort and creativity demonstrated in the full-length movie. On the big screen, you can see the artisan's fingerprints in the clay, which to me, is a positive. It shows the enormous care and skill used to craft the characters and make them come to life. It took five years to put this movie together, and once you see it, you'll know it was worth every minute. We loved the movie, and we'll be buying it when it hits DVD."
269,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,8 October 2005,"Excellent, but Parks doesn't top himself","If I had never seen any of Nick Parks' other work, this would be a revelation - full of heart, brilliant, & clever. However, I'm a long time fan and while I'd never pan any of his work, this isn't the best he's ever done. That honor would have to go to either ""A Close Shave"" (short subject) or ""Chicken Run"" (feature length).Although the bits & pieces are typically hilarious and inventive, the whole is somewhat less than the sum of its parts. And there are a few rough edges. The human villain and, to a lesser degree, Wallace's lady interest lack some of the qualities I've come to expect from Parks' work. Also the plot, while serviceable, isn't as crisp and coherent as some of his best work. Finally, both the animal villain and the cute secondary animals aren't up to the standards he set in ""A Close Shave"".In short, I can recommend it to anyone. But true Aardman fans shouldn't set their expectations as high as they might."
270,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,8 October 2005,The film that the fans wanted!,"The appallingly bad Madagascar movie opener not only was forgotten by the first ten minutes of Curse but confused people when the BBFC rating screen popped up. As the images of that appallingly bad happy Christmas movie faded away, we were relished to the images of Wallace and Gromit: Through the ages! Fantastic story based on photos as the credits roll past, and then we highlight the moon and the film name turns into a bunny, using fantastic graphics that put Pixar and Dreamworks to shame. The story unfolds as little rabbits begin to attack the vegetables cared for by the village, 4 days before the town's annual vegetable show and contest. Anti-Pesto, our dynamic duo's security group, and new company, are the ones who secure the vegetables in the most extremely irrelevant ways. As the story unfolds, Wallace meets a rich woman and tries to come up with a way to rehabilitate rabbits and make them hate vegetables. This film has a quintessentially English attitude, although at some parts this film is childish and has some sad moments, only ever done in A Close Shave. The computer graphics are hard to spot, the fingerprints add a realism to the film and make the characters have a soul. This film is great fun, and well made, but a bit too childish in some cases."
271,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,7 October 2005,Solid Movie for Kids & Adults,"Perhaps this is a bit biased, for I loved W & G as a kid, but I was also kind of worried that this movie might not measure up to the shows of old.Luckily I was wrong.The humor is sharp, clever, and the jokes span from kiddie pranks to adult humor. The townsfolk are hilarious and the attention to detail is quite impressive. Sallis is solid as usual, but Fiennes and Bonham Carter both give excellent voices to their respective characters. Most notably, Fiennes really gave his character a sinister feel with his voice.The one problem of this film is that it feels a bit rushed at times, especially during some of the action sequences, which makes them a little clunky.I certainly recommend it. For pretty much anybody.9/10."
272,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,3,13 October 2005,My comments on Wallace and Gromit,"I took my daughter to see this who is 4 years old. She was not interested in this at all. I thought it was okay, but it really wasn't all that funny to me. It was cute and sad at the same time. I was wondering what happened at the end since all the power went out in the town where I saw it and I never did get to see the last 15 minutes of the movie, and even with the free pass, I don't want to go sit through it again. What is up with the foreign type cartoons lately? I just felt this movie was made a long time ago, and with the accents, it just wasn't my type of movie. Maybe someone else might like it, but the other 20 people that were in the theater with us on the second day running, didn't seem very impressed either."
273,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,4,26 December 2005,What The Heck Is A Were Rabbit?,"What in the world is a Were Rabbit. This movie was a bad look for Wallace and Gromit. Their careers were more successful in A Close Shave, The Wrong Trousers, and A Grand Day Out. This movie is not even about them this is about a werewolf rabbit. This movie was hardly entertaining. This was better then The Pacifier. If I were to give it a grade I would give it a C- and out of stars I would give it 1 and a half stars. The movie was good but had major flauds in it. Helena Bonham Carter was a good choice to have be in it. Peter Sallis returning for Wallace was still very good also. I hop one day though that they let Gromit talk in an episode or a sequel movie."
274,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,1,21 October 2005,Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen,"For those who have not wasted their money to see this, count yourself lucky. My kids (6 and 8 years old) begged to see it and we decided to take them.The claymation looked like something from a 1980's high school film project. There were several suggestive references to sex in the movie that I thought should not be in a G rated movie and I don't usually care about such things.The whole plot was absurd and lacked any sort of sense.If you like bad animation and movies with no plot then this is the movie for you.DreamWorks should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing this with their name on it.Horrible."
275,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,4,22 October 2005,"8.1 rating,   You Can't Be Serious!","I just got back from taking my 4 year old granddaughter to see this,and it has been a long time since I was so disappointed in a film! They should get an Oscar for the previews though,and how good they make this movie look to SUCKER you in! My granddaughter,who normally loves movies was so bored that she talked and played through most of it,and I was getting sleepy. It is very S-L-O-W,not much action,and no where as funny or fun as I was led to believe. It most assuredly will not be added to my collection or her father's. It is kind of a cute story,but it just does not hold your interest. There is NO WAY this film deserves to be on the top 250. I hate to think what more deserving film this one bumped off the list! I think from now on I will go by the off-site reviews instead."
276,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,20 September 2005,Cracking good movie!,"The first time I saw 'The Wrong Trousers' and saw the look on Gromit's face when he received a collar and leash for his birthday I was hooked. I grew up watching the three half-hour movies over and over so I waited with cautious anticipation for 'Curse of the Were-Rabbit', unsure whether the much beloved characters could make the transition to the big screen. I was not disappointed. Wallace and Gromit were as adorable as ever, the supporting characters were colourful, the plot didn't drag and all the best bits of the original movies. Maybe I'm biased because I've always been a fan of the duo but I absolutely loved it, so I hope the rest of you enjoy it as much as I did."
277,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,1,20 May 2007,Why do people think its funny? Its Not!!!,"I was going to see Wallace and gromit the curse of the were rabbit and i knew it would SUCK SO MUCH! Lots of people think its funny but it is pointless crap about a stupid weird accent dumbass Wallace who becomes a were rabbit. Was the lighting part funny? Nope. Was the naked part funny? Nope. SEE, NOTHINGS FUNNY IN THIS FILM!!!!!!! How can the people run away from a giant rabbit and why cant there be a were wolf? Who has ever heard Little cute rabbits howl like a wolf. It is dumb how the bastard becomes a were rabbit. Cant it be a failed experiment because rabbits in the Brian is gay. My dad hated it, my sister loved it but my mum never saw the stupid film. God that movie ticked me off, brove! GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY BACK BECAUSE THIS FILM IS CRAP AND SO IT Ticked ME OFF! Stupid flipping film. I give this a 1 out of 10 because the only part that made me laugh was that everyone talking about lemons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
278,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,3,3 May 2006,Not Really My Cup Of Tea,"As I liked the first three outings for Wallace & Gromit I was really looking forward to this feature-length movie.I must say that I was quite disappointed with the whole thing and I didn't enjoy it at all. I never laughed once and didn't even manage a smile, mind you it does take a damn lot to make me laugh, but this movie was not my kind of humour at all; maybe it has something to do with the fact that I have an extreme phobia of rabbits - I'm petrified of the things and a giant one out on the loose is the stuff of nightmares for me, no matter how cute it looked.What really cheesed me off was that on many occasions you could see fingerprints in the clay characters, especially on Gromit and I thought that made it look very amateur. You'd have thought the film-makers would have worn rubber gloves to avoid such a thing happening. And Wallace's inventions were extremely OTT and ridiculous.I think this movie was very damaging for the good reputation the Wallace and Gromit features have made for themselves in the previous outings. If this is the best they can come up with now then I would say the best thing they could do right now is call it a day before they damage their reputation any further.I can see how it would appeal to many people but it just wasn't my kind of thing and was a huge let down."
279,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,1,30 January 2006,I just don't get it,"Not sure what the big fuss about this movie was. Maybe I just didn't get most of the jokes. Possibly because I was having a hard time just following the Canadian or Yorkshire or Scottish or whatever silly accent they were speaking in.Moreover, it seemed like one needed a lot of context from probably previous productions (TV series? short films?) to appreciate the humor. Or maybe it was just too subtle for me. I've been raised on ""Seinfeld-South Park-Frasier-Dumb and dumber-Road trip"" type of humor where one doesn't need a PhD to be able to identify what's funny.Biggest waste of my time ever."
280,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,2,4 November 2016,"Don't let the children watch it, it gave me nightmares as a child","(excuse my English, it is not my native language)I haven't watched this movie in over 10 years. And after all this time of not seeing anything about it, and neither my parents or my sister remembering it, I thought it might have been a weird fragment of my imagination, some weird fantasy thing kids come up with. I don't know if I should be happy this is real, or terrified. Happy because I'm not insane, terrified because other kids might have seen it too.As a kid I watched this movie once or twice, but it gave me nightmares, and sometimes still have nightmares about it, I don't know if its the weird idea of a guy turning into a were-rabbit, or my fear of the machines Wallace build (how they could kill you in a single malfunction), or the fact that stop motion animation was just not my thing as a kid.The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because I can't remember it that well, but I sometimes my thoughts wander back to this movie, and it still scares me."
281,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,15 August 2014,Animation funny images creative,"I watched this movie for maybe 30minutes. Wallace & Gromit were hired by people that had gardens. They had a truck and would capture animals that would ruin people's gardens.They would capture lots of rabbits and them back to their business. There was a built in shoot at in the kitchen like a laundry shoot and they would take rabbits by the bunch and let them slide down the shoot where they all landed and stayed captured. They would dice up lots of carrots and send them down the shoot to feed the rabbit.When things start getting out of hand Wallace starts to experiment how he could brainwash the rabbits into not eating cabbage, carrots and other vegetables. He used an electric helmet attached to his head and put the rabbits in a tube where they get the signals from his brain to theirs.Something went wrong and they changed. At some point I stopped watching because they show a rabbit breaking into a church and breaking the stain glass windows. There was a Cross in the church that ended up on the ground and the minister sees something that scares him and uses two cucumber as a cross to block the scary rabbit and faints.Aardman makes great animation movies and series like Shaun the Sheep. I felt this was insulting so I stopped watching. Humor is good but not when you use religious objects in a offensive way just because it is in a animated movie."
282,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,3 March 2012,Crakling good!,"Being a ""Wallace and Gromit-fan"", I was looking forward for this full-length movie. Surprisingly I saw it at THE world-premiere in Vlissingen (NL), at the Film by the Sea festival. A wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and merry movie. It's about Wallace and Gromit (whom I believe don't need an introduction) having their own pest-control company in the city which is hosting a giant-vegetable contest in a few days. Everyone, including an eccentric baroness, is hoping his or her giant carrot or melon will win the Golden carrot. Unfortunately the town is plagued by lots of hungry rabbits. This is where W&G come in. The have their own cracking contraptions to control these cute creatures in a human way.It's a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who liked the three proceeding short movies of W&G (which are more than great!), will love this full-length movie. Nick Park really delivered a wonderful and original result with a great sense for humor. Like in Chicken Run, it truly amazes me how he can capture so much story and emotions in just a few frames. ""Job well done, lad"" ;-) Oh yeah: The music was fantastic! It really completes the ride. Enjoy!"
283,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,1 November 2010,Not bad,"For a bunch of clay being put together in such a way to make a film from a series that I've seen as a child, I must say it is very well done! I love the old films and the children films where the swearing and the nudity is minimal and the funny children's humor is there.I do admit computer animation would have been more easier to use, but I'm very impressed that it took them that long and they made a high quality film with these limitations in technology, if you call it that.I liked the story idea, it was actually quite entertaining despite the fact that I'm 17 years old and liked Avatar, which is a completely different type of movie."
284,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,28 May 2009,"A hilarious, exciting, thrilling Animated Masterpiece","Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbbit is quite simply extraordinary. It is one of the few films that really is very likable and perfect in every way. The stop-motion animation is incredible, the screenplay is clever and very funny. The voice-overs are really specially realistic and go with the story very well. The characters are hilarious and very touching. I love the gags, one-liners, and hidden humor in the film and the way the plot unfolds. I love the music, which was actually a stand-out in every way. The score was very good. The sound effects were flawless, and although I am very glad it won the Animated Feature Oscar it also deserved other nominations for the sound effects and it's brilliant screenplay. This is without a doubt one of my favorite animated films of all time. It truly is animation at the highest level. Do not miss this, truly an animated Masterpiece"
285,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,27 December 2008,A great claymation film,"Having seen the earlier half hour Wallace and Gromit shows I looked forward to seeing their first feature length adventure, although I wasn't sure how well it would work with the longer format. I need not have worried as it was a delight from start to finish.Wallace and Gromit are now running the Anti-Pesto humane pest control service which is protecting the town's vegetables in the run up to the local produce show. Things go well until Wallace has an idea which if all goes according to plan will brainwash the rabbits into hating the idea of eating vegetables. Unfortunately something goes wrong and on the next full moon a fearsome were-rabbit decimates the town's vegetables. Wallace and Gromit are convinced that they can catch the creature but Victor Quartermaine is determined that he will shoot it and in doing so win the heart of Lady Campanula Tottington, owner of the local hall.As with the short films the claymation style animation is excellent and the voice acting is very good, especially from Peter Sallis, I couldn't imagine anybody else doing the voice of Wallace. There is plenty of amusing action, especially towards the end when Gromit takes to the air to thwart Victor's plans. I would certainly recommend this film to people of any age."
286,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,3,29 October 2007,Full family entertainment.,"Animated action comedy. The town's prized produce starts disappearing. Cheese-loving inventor Wallace and his trusty canine companion Gromit are bewildered as the rest of the town. Large vegetables are being ravaged and putting the annual giant vegetable growing contest in jeopardy. Lady Tottington commissions Wallace's Anti-Pesto pest-control business to save the day...and the contest...by stopping the nightly raids on the town's vegetable gardens. It seems a giant Were-Rabbit is the culprit. Lady Tottington's snobby suitor, Victor Quartermaine, is determined to shoot the huge rabbit before Wallace can capture it; thus Victor is the town's hero and a step closer at claiming Lady Tottington's hand in marriage. But there are a few surprises in store. Lending voices to the animated characters are: Peter Sallis, Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, Nicholas Smith, Peter Kay and Mark Gatiss."
287,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,20 September 2007,Great Eye Candy But 2005 Had More !?,"This is one nice cinematic adventure. It got standout pace, too many dexterous enjoyable details, having such unique talent from everybody. For instance it's based upon new treatment for (Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde), by intelligent and funny script made it this time as (Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Rabbit) ! However I have a bothering importunate question : Why after beautiful time you have with this one.. You just forget it so easily in the wake of its ending ?! I think the answer would be that there is no strong meaning behind all of this pure brightness. As this movie didn't touch the feelings to the extent of moving or impassioning you about something unless being in sympathy with this good scientist who became a victim of his scientific ambition and turned without intention into a gigantic evil freak. But all of that just drowns under the thickness of the adventure itself to be all in all a dazzling fun ONLY.Undoubtedly it is interesting for its numerous glee niceties and for being the most humor (Jekyll/Hyde)'s situation; where (Jekyll) this time transforms into monster rabbit and a serial killer of vegetables ! Though, I see that it doesn't rise high to that area of noble melancholy nor enchant us with many profound paradoxes which are in its tough competitor from the same year Tim Burton's (Corpse Bride). Despite how (Corpse..) lost the Academy Award that this British one gained, I've always thought that Burton's movie speaks to mind and heart before eyes so it'll live longer than (The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit)."
288,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,15 March 2006,Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,"This fourth Oscar winner film for Nick Park is an excellent Plastercine film. I thought Chicken took a long time (4 years), this took 5, and one scene took one of those years! Anyway, Wallace (Peter Sallis) and Gromit are now Anti-Pesto, a service to eliminate the town of pests. Basically Lady Campanula Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter) has a rabbit infestation, and while capturing the bunnies, Wallace and Gromit make a bit of an enemy with Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes). When trying his new invention to stop bunnies love for vegetables Wallace causes a terrifying incident. They thought it was Hutch turning into a huge monster, or Were-Rabbit, but it was the opposite way, Hutch is becoming Wallace, and you can guess what's wrong with Wallace when the moon comes out. Also starring Peter Kay as PC Mackintosh, Nicholas Smith as Reverend Clement Hedges, Liz Smith as Mrs. Mulch and John Thomson as Mr. Windfall. Filled with fantastic gags and Plastercine effects, this is genuine fun for the whole family. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film. Wallace and Gromit were number 11 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and the film was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!"
289,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,14 March 2006,Excellent movie everything I expected and more.,"Five years in the making this movie is excellent and well worthy of the Oscar.Definitely one of my all time favourite animations.Wallace and his trustworthy dog gromit are out to save the day again as the great vegetable competition at tottington hall is about to begin and anti pesto(wallace and gromit)are trying to stop the rabbits that plague their village with their humain methods from eating the contestant's precious vegetables.As storage problems get in the duo's way for keeping the rabbits,wallace attempts to brainwash the rabbits so they don't like veg any more but like most of his untrustworthy inventions wallace gets it terribly wrong and now they have a bigger problem on their hands a much bigger problem they have created a monster the were rabbit and now they must do everything they can to stop it before the vegetable competition begins.This an excellent movie one that advise movie lovers of all ages to check out.Well done to Nick park and Steve box for making such a lovable movie."
290,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,13 March 2006,"Very good, but not quite as good as the 3 shorts.","W&G are excellent as always, but the freshness and originality of the 3 earlier shorts are not quite there; in comparison, CotWR is a bit derivative. The overall effort was a bit of a retelling of 'A close Shave'. In all fairness, a lot of CotWR is homage to the earlier works. Still, if the future holds another W&G, I would like to see some more of the truly fresh and original material.Warning to the easily offended, there is some adult humor skillfully woven into this feature. It is kid safe; it will either fly over their heads, or they're already more savvy than you're giving them credit for.In summary; excellent, in the top 10% of all animations ever, if you have kids, buy the video, your kids will play it over and over, but see the W&G shorts first.MadKaugh"
291,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,13 March 2006,pure class !,"Watched it on DVD yesterday, its genius ,sheer genius. You suddenly remember what the word entertainment means whilst watching it.There are no words to express the obvious amount of love, wit and intelligence that goes into Nick Park's and ardmans creation. Everything in the movie works right from the beginning to the end, the writing, the voice over work, the inspired animation of the characters, it just leaps off the screen.Its so rare to find anything today that would honestly appeal to any age group on some level, but Wallace and Gromit achieves this without any effort, its just pure class, from top to bottom."
292,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,12 March 2006,The atmosphere is intact!,"The taste of crackers and the smell of cheese still puts a smile on our faces, even ten years after.Wallace and Gromit are the unforgettable inventors with a love for crackers, cheese and tea. Oh, and a tendency to always get into trouble while doing harmless things.Nick Park returns with The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which is an absolutely wonderful piece of animation. Even though it's three times as long as the previous masterpieces, it is still able to catch the original atmosphere and brilliant humour.A must-see for those who loved the previous ones."
293,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,,10 March 2006,"Vintage Wallace and Gromit. Good, funny movie.","I wonder, can we watch a Wallace and Gromit movie and NOT at the same time marvel at how well the claymation is done? Having figures in 3 dimensions really adds something over computer animation. But I suspect there will come a time where costs drive them to computer animation, and if so, I suspect we will enjoy the stories just as much. The real charm is in watching the inventor Wallace and his human-like dog Gromit go about their business.This movie is about a giant vegetable competitions. As in ""giant vegetables"". So most of the townspeople hire Wallace's firm ""Anti Pesto"" to protect their prize crops from pests, especially the rabbits.From the title, we can expect a were-rabbit somewhere along the way.SPOILERS. Wallace inadvertently exchanges some characteristics with one of the rabbits. The rabbit begins to take on some Wallace characteristics, while Wallace develops into a giant were-rabbit under a full moon night, subsequently terrorizing the gardens of all the neighbors. With the help of Gromit, eventually all is returned to normal."
294,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,4 March 2006,The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit (2005) ***,"I hadn't watched CHICKEN RUN (2001) or the ""Wallace & Gromit"" TV series, so I didn't quite know how I would take this feature-length effort; I must say that I was very surprised with the results. The film was a delight: very funny, clever and with any number of wonderful sight gags that ought to shame the makers of what passes for comedy nowadays! Wallace and Gromit turned out to be a very likable pair after all, as were the ""villainous"" dog and the flock of bunnies who, obviously, play a pivotal role in the proceedings. Besides, its take on werewolf films is quite nicely done. The form of clay animation adopted here is somewhat crude (when compared to the standard Disney style)...but I vastly prefer it to CGI!"
295,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,11 February 2006,Why Make It Long?,"Why did they have to make a full length film about Wallace and Gromit? I love the short films and was really looking forward to seeing the full length one. After I saw it I was wondering what went so badly wrong. Was it the fact that maybe the shorts didn't have enough plot for a feature film and they didn't want to come up with anything new? Was it the fact that none of the supporting characters seemed alive? Was it that Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter seem to be reading their lines for the first time? Maybe the fact that it brings no new ideas to either the plot or Wallace and Gromit? Who really knows? I guess nobody, all I know is how bad this movie was."
296,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,20 December 2005,"I love W&G, but Nick Park should have stuck with the short form.","I love Wallace & Gromit, but Nick Park should have stuck with the short form. This film obviously replicates the successful formula we saw in the earlier short films, but feels stretched out simply to generate enough length to warrant classification as a feature film. It could have and should have stayed a short. Then it'd be just as brilliant as the rest. It has all the great stuff: Gromit as Chaplin, Wallace as my ex-father-in-law. A mystery solved by Gromit rather than Wallace. A budding romance for Wallace. And two classic cartoon chase scenes. I liked it, while my nieces loved it. Actually, I think they only liked it too, but said they loved it because I paid for them to see it."
297,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,8,16 November 2005,so many hidden gags & references,"Who the were-rabbit was, was obvious. I'd guessed that way before it was revealed. Lots of aardman characters show up, like frank the creature comforts tortoise as a security device. I also saw the lurpak butter guy as one of the church door-posts.The whole king Kong skit, the snoopy & red baron skit. Lots of little throw-away gags which most people will want to buy the DVD to watch.I think a lot of the plot and some running gags were thrown away as maybe too hard to do in the time limit to get the film into cinemas.The film is visually excellent. It looks so nice, the CGI doesn't show too much. Some of the models look a little weird. A few of the Wallace models look a bit weird, it's hard to explain what I exactly mean. He doesn't look right.The film could have done with being a bit longer, maybe 20 minutes or so more in length.I did enjoy it, I switched off my brain, ignored the goofs, gaffs and mistakes (which is normally quite hard for me not to do). It was pleasantly stupid.Go see it or wait for the DVD."
298,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,6,28 October 2005,"Terrific fun, if a little cloying","A triumphant full-length debut from Nick Park. The meticulous preparation that goes into every frame means that jokes can be timed quite brilliantly and the film is consequently extremely funny (In fact many jokes may pass the relaxed viewer by on a first viewing; there are many adult and subtle quips to keep the adults bringing children along entertained).I was a little concerned from the start that the tone of the film might be a little frightening for a U cert. - nothing is truly shocking but in order to set up his gags Park uses pretty robust horror-vernacular which is quite spine-chilling. Irrespective of the propriety of this though, it certainly shows that Park has command of what he's trying to do.Gags, film-references and light mocking of Englishness aside the story is good and has a brilliantly worked twist to it. Above all the technical brilliance of the project surely merits a return trip to Hollywood for its creator. Of particular note is the way in which the Lady Tottington character is first seen walking down steps, in a sashay that not only transcends the fact that the character is plasticine but is also entirely representative of how Helena Bonham-Carter, the voice-over artist, moves. 5/10"
299,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,7,14 October 2005,A Good film - Not Great - but very good!,"I guess I am a minority opinion here - in some ways this film is VERY good - the dog has received praise from a number of quarters as being one of the most facially expressive actors in screen history, and it is amazing what they did with the eyebrow movement.SPOILER AHEAD! I guess my problem with the movie that so much was lifted from the familiar, that some of the fun, which normally comes from the unexpected, was already known, so I had the feeling that I was watching a repeat. For example, the movie pays heavy homage to the Gerry Anderson Thunderbird series - the alarm system, which lights up the eyes of pictures of the customers, is directly lifted from Thunderbirds, as is the entire initial launching sequence, where Wallace and Gromit basically repeat Thunderbird 2's launch sequence.Still, the movie contains some surprises - the actual Were-Rabbit came to me as a complete surprise! And this film is made with a level of loving care that you don't see anymore with the advent of computer generated graphics - its refreshing to see a film that doesn't rely on spectacular effects or gore to be entertaining.The movie here was preceded by a short based on the Madagascar penguins - which, like the main feature, borrowed heavily from the familiar, although the twists were funny (the penguin swallowing a bunch of mints, and then being fired like a machine gun, is almost a straight lift from an old Porky Pig/Daffy Duck cartoon.) And it is also very funny! So, all in all, a very good film - one that I would recommend for any age."
300,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,13 October 2005,A perfectly delightful film that thankfully doesn't drag.,"Wallace and Gromit thankfully didn't succumb to the all too common traps that feature length films about short subject characters fall into and never lagged once (my main fear going in). The first two W&G shorts (A Trip to the Moon and The Wrong Trousers) were excellent, short and sweet. The third (A Close Shave) while certainly better than a majority of animation coming out these days, was definitely a step behind the first two. It focused on thrills instead of comedy which was an unwise choice in my opinion as The Wrong Trousers gives you both. Curse of the Were-rabbit manages to give both with no down time. The requisite love interest and bad guy-who-never-appeared-in-anything-involving-these-characters-before were present but handled so well that I hardly noticed it and even enjoyed said characters. Definitely, definitely one of the year's best films."
301,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,9,8 October 2005,Surprisingly. . . . . . . . Good!!!!,"This movie was very good in the sense that Corpse Bride was released a couple of weeks before this and it was horribly awful. I love the expressions the bunnies make when they are in the vacuum thingy. Also, I love Gromit's expressions. This movie is excellent in the fact that it was clay mation. Also, the short before it with the penguins was awesome. I think the guy that plays Wallace did one of the penguins voices in this short. Because, I don't remember any of the penguins in Madagascar to be English. This movie will knock your socks off. Well, I have to have ten lines of text so blah blah awesome movie keep it real OK done with i think that is about it."
302,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,8 October 2005,A great Return for the lovable duo,"A great return for Nick Park.Wallace and Gromit are back, and the animation is as fresh and entertaining as ever. The Magdagascar short before the film almost highlighted the amazing art of the film making. This has taken 5 years to make and some of the scenes are amazing.The story is original, but not quite as good as the original shorts: Wrong Trousers and Close Shave. However, it serves to reveal the whole town they live in, revealing Wallace's new gadgets.As good as Chicken Run. This should be a runaway box office hit. Great Fun, British Humour at its best. A must see"
303,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,8 October 2005,Excellent,"BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR I will take all my friends to go and see this movie. It is a masterpiece of comedy and animation. I live in a small town in Ohio and the theater was full and everyone applauded at the end. I have always loved Wallace and Gromit films but I did not expect to be this blown away by the film. I also heard children openly laughing and clapping throughout the film. It is appropriate and enjoyable for all ages. After watching the film, I immediately wanted to see it again to catch everything I probably missed the first time considering it is so full of action and jokes and hilarity. I await with major anticipation the next W and G movie!!!"
304,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,8 October 2005,Simply put this is as good as it gets.,"It took around 5 years you make this movie. Maybe that's why the Wallace & Gromit stories are so good. I mean if you're going to put that much effort into something, you're going to make damned sure it's worth it. Simply put this is as good as it gets. Nick Park gets more expression out of a clay dog that doesn't even have a mouth, than 95% of Hollywood's A-list. It's so funny I could never do it justice in a review. The cinema I saw it in was packed with kids of all ages, toddlers, teens, and adults of all ages too. Who laughed more? Probably the adults, as we were old enough to get things like a jam (jelly) called middle aged spread, the references to movies from ""king Kong"", to ""Harvey"" to ""watership down"". This is genuinely one of the best animated movies of all time, more than that it is cone of the funniest films I have seen in years. Please, Please, Please take everyone you know to see this, we need more quality animated films like this, and a few less quickies like ""robots""."
305,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,8 October 2005,"So funny i was in tears, and was cute as well","The first thing that comes to mind is that this would have to be one of the funniest films ever. I am someone who had grown up watching the original 20-30 minute short films so I was really excited about this film. I guess I could see them making it from the moment I first saw the trailer for Chicken Run. And thank god they did make it, as they brought two very lovable character to the big screen and failed to disappoint.The story was a little cheesy and was like a Frankenstein knock-off. But with non-stop gags these things do go unnoticed and will surely make this film a big hit. If you don't laugh you may as well be a robot.What I did like about this film was that there was plenty of cute characters which included Gromit. A lot of the new characters aren't that funny and looking at Wallace's love interest it's a good thing this wasn't live action.If anything this showed that the old fashioned animation seen in the original films has died. And that vegetables can really grow really big as one of the things that made me feel for Gromit was seeing him prepare for a vegetable show that the film was centred around.A warning though there's some scenes that younger children have find to scary.And if anything it was so funny I left in tears!SEE IT OR ELSE TO SUM IT UP!!!20/10"
306,The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,10,24 September 2005,"Could this movie be a satire or an allegory, like The Wrong Trousers?","Probably not. And even if it were, few would see it. Have Wallace and Gromit fans and animation buffs realised that The Wrong Trousers is actually a well-disguised allegory and political satire on post-war Britain, its elites, the welfare state, political correctness, race and discrimination? It alludes to Shakespeare's All's Well That Ends Well, Hans Christian Andersen's The Emperor's New Clothes, Plato's The Republic and George Orwell's Animal Farm. In fact, it deserves to be hailed as the new Animal Farm and be taught in high school and at university as a superlative narrative linking art and politics. And it is even more relevant today than it was back then in 1993. Why didn't the makers admit to the world that The Wrong Trousers is an allegory and a political satire? Perhaps for the same reason that they dare not make another one. Just as worrying is the fact that many millions of W&G fans can detect puns and in-jokes, but they can't connect them into a coherent narrative. Is the viewing public really so ignorant so that they can neither make sense of the allusion to classical works of literature and film nor see connections to modern history? And the same goes for the critics, too, but they should know better. Wake up Wallace and Gromit fans, critics and citizens. And particularly British citizens - it's your political system that The Wrong Trousers is all about. Of course, I could be wrong in thinking that the creators would not attempt something so profound as The Wrong Trousers: The Curse of the Were-Rabitt may yet turn out to be more than just a brilliant animation and wonderful entertainment.
