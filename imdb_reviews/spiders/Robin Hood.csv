0,Robin Hood,10,10 February 2004,Disney's most under rated film,"Robin Hood is personally one of my favorite Disney movies of all time, it's one of those animated films that gets over looked or over shadowed by other Disney classics, I wish it did get more notice. The animation is great and just has that old feel to it when animators used to draw the pictures, it feels more personal and special that way. Not to mention that this was a great adaptation of the Robin Hood story for the kids. Even as an adult I still enjoy watching this movie, it's funny, romantic, touching, and just very entertaining to watch. How could you not love Prince John? He is one of Disney's most awesome and hilarious villains of all time! Granted I know this film can come off as a little corny, but seriously give this movie a chance, it's one of Disney's buried treasures.The story begins as Robin Hood and Little John run from the Sheriff of Nottingham, who has ambushed them with a team of archers. After narrowly escaping, Robin Hood and Little John happen upon the royal entourage which is taking Prince John and his counselor, Sir Hiss, to Nottingham in order to tax the people there. Disguised as female fortune-tellers, Robin and Little John effectively steal all the gold they can carry and run off into the forest, leaving Prince John sucking his thumb in humiliation. In Nottingham, Robin uses Friar Tuck to smuggle the stolen gold back to the peasants. Later Robin sees Maid Marian, she and Robin had once been sweethearts as children, but were forced to part ways when she moved to London. But she is mistaken: Robin can't stop thinking about her. But since Robin is an outlaw he and Marian wait for marriage. Seething with rage, that Robin is winning, John triples the taxes, making the bleak situation in Nottingham even worse. One night, Robin Hood, disguised again as the beggar, learns that Friar Tuck is in jail and will rescue him, save Nottingham once and for all and give Prince John the justice that has been coming to him for a long time.I can't tell you how much I love this film, I think my favorite scene will always be the archery scene. Robin Hood learns that there is an archery contest and the winner gets a kiss from Maid Marian, so he enters and goes in a disguise, and Little John had his back the whole time while getting Prince John to lighten up about Robin being in the contest. I also love Prince John's side kick, Sir Hiss, he's the perfect little sleaze bag tattle tail and we go in Tom and Jerry classic mode when Prince John has it with him and just ties Hiss's body in a knot. This is a terrific Disney movie, just trust me when I say that it's a lot of fun to watch and just enjoy it, we don't get films like this any more.10/10"
1,Robin Hood,,19 April 2000,This Robin Hood is a real scream!,"I've watched this video so many times, I can no longer count, and every time, I wind up laughing my head off!  I really think this is one of the most underrated Disney movies out there.This version of Robin Hood has animals in the roles of the characters, and it works marvelously!  It would be natural for Robin Hood to be a fox if he was an animal, for both the fox and Robin are very clever.  And if Robin Hood is a fox, naturally, Maid Marian would be a vixen.  Also, having Prince John and King Richard as lions are natural choices, since the lion is the King of the Jungle.What I loved most about the film, as I hinted at earlier, is the humor, most of it provided by Prince John, Sir Hiss (a snake), Trigger, and Nutsy (both vultures).  Prince John's habit of sucking his thumb whenever anyone mentions his mother is priceless!  And he's so vain it's little trouble for Robin Hood and Little John (a bear) to rob him when they're disguised as fortune-tellers!  Sir Hiss is smarter than any of the other bad guys, but the humor with him is that Prince John never believes him until it's too late, and abuses him afterwards.  Trigger's ""old Betsy"" (a crossbow) provides plenty of laughs, especially when it goes off!  And Nutsy is so stupid he says ""One o'clock and all's well!"" when it's three o'clock, and when told to set his brain ahead a couple hours, he doesn't know if he has to add or subtract two hours!  That's a scream!If there's any real fault, it lies in the animation.  It is really substandard, and I have noticed reused or inaccurate footage in the film. But it is a minor flaw in the film, and it doesn't take away from my enjoyment of it.So, rent or buy ""Robin Hood"" today!  It's a scream!Belle Book"
2,Robin Hood,7,19 June 2005,Disney's Red Headed Step-child,"I loved this movie as a kid, as did just about every person I know. So it works for the youngins. As an adult, and an animation fan, I was surprised to learn that this movie is sort of the Disney studio's secret shame. I had nothing but fond memories of it, after all. And I could name at least a dozen Disney films that I would have put ahead of it on my Most Crappy list. I very recently watched it on television after many years, and yes, it is definitely flawed. The quality of the animation is terrible, and the lack of an over arching story makes the whole thing seem frivolous, like it was made for TV and not for a big studio release. There are holes in the narrative, scenes that should exist that don't, and scenes that have no reason to exist that do. And I think the somewhat random decision to cast the film with animals lends to the Saturday morning vibe as well.But there's enough cool things peaking out from under all the half-assery that rescues the film just enough for it to be enjoyable. Peter Ustinov turns in an excellent, excellent performance as Prince John, at turns hysterical and genuinely nasty. Brian Bedford oozes easy going charm as Robin. He's probably turned in the second most likable performance of the character captured on film. He's just unfortunately delivering it through the poorly animated mouth of a cartoon fox. And though the actual quality of the animation is poor, some of the character animation is pretty clever and expressive. And I have to applaud the choice to add Roger Miller to the mix as a folkie, possibly pot-smoking minstrel rooster. His character adds a cool, Earthy vibe to the proceedings and as others have mentioned, his song, Not in Nottingham, actually sort of works as a blues song. Weird.So Robin Hood is definitely not the epic tale Disney was capable of churning out in its hey days, but I dug it as a kid, and I still dig it today. You know, looking back at all my reviews on this site, it seems I mostly leap to the defense of classically bad films that I like anyway. That's OK, I guess. Someone has to."
3,Robin Hood,,26 July 2006,Why is Robin Hood Disney's Step Child?,"Disney's Robin Hood is my all time favorite Disney animation movie and right up there with one of my favorite all time movies. I can practically recite every word from ""Robin Hood and Little John Walking through the Forest"" to ""There's the church bells someone's gett'n hitched"". Yet it's hardly ever mentioned, it's always been hard to find and you can never get a poster. The songs are never lauded and they should be ""The Phoney King of England"" is a hoot! And even though ""Love"" was nominated for an Oscar, it's an obscure fact.The animation is beautiful! Those scenes of the castle & the church in the rain - you would think it was shot rather than drawn. The dialog is smart with subtleties & wit. The character's motives are seen and not told. It's not dumb down at all for kids. It's more romantic then Lady & The Tramp, Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid combined. And yes, that Fox, Robin Hood himself, voiced by Brian Bedford was and will always be sexy!"
4,Robin Hood,10,7 April 2002,The best telling of Robin Hood on the silver screen,"It is strange how many people damn the Disney version of ""Robin Hood"" for rough and repetitious animation, one-dimensional characters, and weak pacing. After all, A LOT of animated films suffer from this syndrome, even ""landmark"" productions like ""Anastasia"" and ""Shrek."" The characters are stereotypes, but they act believably: Prince John is silly, but with a truly evil undercurrent (""Squeeze every last drop out of those insolent...musical...peasants.""), the Sheriff is deliciously nasty (""Upsy-daisy""), and Robin Hood is very affable. The music is, quite simply, fantastic. ""Not in Nottingham"" is easily the best Disney song ever (barring ""When She Loved Me"" in Toy Story 2), the opening theme and song are catchy and appropriate for the movie's tone, and the movie's action scenes are clever, chaotic, and action-packed but not gory. This is a movie you can show your kids without being embarrassed upon seeing that the movie is one long commercial for action figures and plush toys."
5,Robin Hood,10,29 October 2005,Disney's best,"I've watched Robin Hood since before I could understand language. Even back then it entertained me, enough for my parents to have to play it whenever they wanted to keep me out of trouble. One would expect that anything that can hold the attention of a toddler is not going to have the same effect on an adult. I am glad to say that it does. I can watch this film today with the same eagerness, the same enjoyment and the same suspension of knowledge of what's going to happen. Who could help doing otherwise? It's first class storytelling.There are the age-old characters, archetypes as well known as the story itself. In a twist of genius, the tale is set in the animal world. Robin Hood, everyone's hero, brought to magnificent life by a fox and given a dashing yet endearing voice. There's his ladylove, the long-lashed, elegant, eminently lovable Maid Marian, also a fox and just as perfectly voiced. One look at Marian, and it's easy to understand why Robin is so lost in his dreams of her that he ruins the stew he's been stirring.Prince John, however likable the others, has somehow topped my list. Fittingly chosen to be a mane-less lion (compare his appearance with his brother Richard who has an ample mane), constantly whining for his mother when thwarted and complaining about Richard, he is the best representation of John I've ever seen. One mustn't forget his penchant for alliterating, in especial reference to his much put-upon sidekick/adviser Sir Hiss, a snake. Priceless gems like ""Procrastinating Python"", ""Slithering Serpent"" and of course the irresistible ""You eel in snake's clothing"" can all be heard directed at the pitiable Sir Hiss whenever John is frustrated in his plans to capture the elusive Robin. The unfortunate duo plays off each other very well. It must be said that whoever thought of getting Sir Peter Ustinov to voice the role of P.J. should have been promoted instantly. The late, brilliant Ustinov is greatly missed, but he lives on in his wonderful comedic works. His part here is right up there with his best performances. No one could have done greater justice to the younger brother who (rightly) feels that his governance compares unfavourably with Richard's.A few other characters deserve to be mentioned. Little John, a bear very reminiscent of Jungle Book's Baloo, is light-hearted, trustworthy and the perfect companion and friend for our Robin. On one occasion early on, they have a great outing together as cross-dressers and use their very believable disguise to steal P.J. for everything he has on him. As for his voice, Little John's carefree American accent works very well alongside the British ones of the others. The lady-in-waiting to Marian, Clucky, is a brave lass and Friar Tuck is a kind old fellow. There are also the kids in the family of rabbits who understandably admire and adore Robin and Marian.The script is smashing. What with the comedy, the heroic and witty lines for the good guys and the hysterical silliness of the sour villains of the story, this is a winner. It's always fun and never grows tired. The little ditty about Prince John's incompetence that goes around (""too late to be known as John the first, he's sure to be known as John the worst"") is very in keeping with the rest of this film's tone. And who can forget the sheer madness of such a line as ""I sentence you to sudden, instant and even immediate death"", courtesy of Prince John of course.It's not only comedy, because to top it all off, this film must have the best confession of love ever filmed. Although it works infinitely better when you watch it, I will attempt to sketch it here. Caught, tied up, sentenced and threatened with execution, Robin looks into Marian's expressive eyes and says ""Marian my darling, I love you more than life itself"". Her emotional response is an equally memorable one to behold. More sweetness inevitably follows in the eventual escape, but I'll leave that for your viewing pleasure.The film wouldn't be complete without a fitting climax, and to satisfy us all, we've been given a good one. Climbing to the top of a turret, Robin has to leap down into the moat to avoid the fires that are close on his heels. His friends down below look on to see where he surfaces and are dismayed to find Robin appearing nowhere yet, to the delight of Prince John and Sir Hiss. It's a nice tug at the heartstrings. Although initially all hope seems lost, we know that the story isn't finished until the deserving Robin gets to be with his Marian and all's right with Nottingham and England.Disney surpassed themselves with this one. It's much more than the sum of its parts (voice talent and likable characters, witty script, character designs, plotting). Having watched this a countless number of times in the past, I look forward to continuing to do so."
6,Robin Hood,10,25 February 2001,Memories,"I am watching this movie while writing this review, and I still remember every single line. This was, and still is, one of my favorite Disney films of all time. People may have complaints about it, (accents, lack of character depth, story line) but I will always have fond memories of watching this movie. To the people who have complaints about it the movie for various reasons: either relax and enjoy, or don't watch it and leave the people who love this Disney Classic alone. Don't ruin this movie for anyone."
7,Robin Hood,,15 August 2006,"Sure It's a Flawed Film, But It's Very Entertaining","""Robin Hood"" is generally considered to be one of the weakest Disney animated classics. Well, much has been said about the film. Remember, after Walt Disney's death in 1966, the studio seemed to enter a rut of sorts. Disney approved ""The Aristocats"" before his death, and the resulting film began production after his death since ""The Jungle Book"" was a huge success in 1967. The resulting film received bad reviews but did well at the box office.""Robin Hood"" on the other hand seemed to be made on a budget, for some reason. I'm guessing the Disney studios wanted to play it safe after Walt's death, and not have anything expensive or very ambitious. Well, on the bright side, ""Robin Hood"" has some interesting characters and some good songs. Some find it annoying and rather generic that Disney adapted the original story and turned the cast into talking animals. Producer Wolfgang Rietherman defended this idea, saying it was a ""whole new way of looking at a classic tale"". He also mentions that audiences exercise a great amount of imagination with animals than humans.Maybe it was done so the newly recruited Disney animators at the time could get started with drawing animal characters. Personally, I'm fine with the talking animal thing. Robin Hood is a fox, and I think that really works for his personality, being sly and crafty. Little John is portrayed as a bear that looks a lot of The Jungle Book's Baloo, and he's voiced by the same actor too, Phil Harris. But Little John is a pretty cool character, and he serves as a good sidekick.I also thought Friar Tuck, Allan-A-Dale, Maid Marian and Lady Klucky were great characters. I wasn't way too fond of Skippy and his friends, as they seemed to slow down the movie a bit with the scene where they go after his arrow.The plot, Robin Hood and Little John rob from the rich to feed the poor. Greedy Prince John, a lion, is taking over while he sent his brother King Richard on a ""crazy crusade"". Unlike the terrifying Disney villains like Maleficent and The Wicked Queen, Prince John is a real wimp. This is what makes him a very funny villain, as he acts childish to get his away. His snake assistant, Sir Hiss, is also a pretty funny character and I like the scenes where he gets Prince John mad.The structure of this film is episodic. It somewhat feels like different episodes of Robin Hood's adventures are strung together to form an 83-minute film. However, I don't find it that disjointed. And the sequences are very entertaining, whether it's Robin Hood and Little John disguised as fortune tellers or the Archery Tournament scene.Not to mention, this film has quite a lot of funny moments. Unfortunately, aside from the plot, the film does suffer from the use of recycled animation. Now yes, ""The Jungle Book"" and ""Goliath II"" (1960 Disney short film) reused animation. In ""Robin Hood"", the reused animation is not subtle. You'll notice, mostly on the ""Phony King of England"" scene, that animation of dancing from ""Snow White"", ""The Jungle Book"" and ""The Aristocats"". This doesn't mean the animation is terrible. The film has nice background artwork and the characters all move fine. It's still ahead of everything else that was out at the time. ""Robin Hood"" was a box office hit despite the mixed reviews, and it's one of the few Disney films that hasn't been put back in the vault (it's been that way since the 1991 video release).The music is one of the higher points. The opening, ""Whistle Stop"", I'll always love. ""Oo-de-Lally"" is a good one too. ""The Phony King of England"" is another good one as well. ""Love"" is alright at best, it sounds sort of dated and syrupy. I'm actually surprised that it was nominated for Academy Award for Best Song. ""Not in Nottingham"" is probably one of the best songs in the film.""Robin Hood"" is a good movie, a very entertaining film from Disney. Sure it's no ""Snow White"" or ""Pinocchio"" or any tour-de-force like that, but it doesn't try to be anything big. It's an entertaining film with flaws, but it's enjoyable.8.5 out of 10."
8,Robin Hood,,16 March 2001,"""Not In Nottingham"" - tough song","When one thinks of Disney songs, one generally thinks along the vein of ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" or ""Once Upon A Dream"".  Disney songs are usually silly love songs, villain's expressions of their villainy, or some generally upbeat nonsense.  Disney songs are generally not hard and gritty.Which is why ""Not In Nottingham"" is my favourite Disney song ever.  It is a hard and emotional song, blues like an icepick to the soul, the loudest and harshest cry of pain I have ever heard in a Disney film.  Where else in Disney-land would you hear a line like ""Don't you know there's nothing left for me?"".Combined as it is with the jail scene, it is melancholia at its depths, and a refreshing change from the general froth one expects, and generally gets, from Disney movies and songs."
9,Robin Hood,,4 July 2002,Disney's Take on the Classic.,"Disney's animated ""Robin Hood"" gets somewhat lost in the shuffle of great animated films from the famed studio, but is still a nice piece of entertainment that tells the popular story well. Good songs and fun situations are the greatest assets here. The film lacks the real drama that makes others of its kind better cinematically. Still a good film for the whole family. 4 stars out of 5."
10,Robin Hood,9,22 January 2005,Absolutely the most under-rated Disney animation ever,"This is my favorite rendition of Robin Hood! Costner has nothing compared to Brian Bedford!This is absolutely the most under-rated Disney animation ever made. While it tells the story quite well, it also has some beautiful supporting characters, a wonderfully treacherous Prince John (Peter Ustinov), and some adorable comic relief in Terry Thomas's Sir Hiss.While this was made when I was around 10 or so, it was still one of my favorite movies of all time. Of course, a scant four years later, Star Wars was to usurp it as my very favorite, but it remained a close second for many years to come.I'm not entirely sure, but I think this is the only Disney animation to have all the characters portrayed by animals alone. The songs, while I usually find them annoying, are quite endearing; cute even. I highly recommend giving it a good watch or two.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :."
11,Robin Hood,8,23 July 1999,"Dah da dee dah dah de doe doe, dah da dee dah diddy, doe","The opening credits present us with all of the animals who will later appear in the film (the very same footage, in fact), parading themselves in front of a white background and a rather catchy tune.  We see a fox dressed as Robin Hood.  ROBIN HOOD, reads the credits.  And in smaller letters underneath, in brackets: (a fox).  We see a badger in a monk's outfit. FRIAR TUCK, says the credits. (a bear).  I find this highly amusing.  I love it.  Don't ask me why.  I think, though, that it demonstrates two things: that ""Robin Hood"" was made under the same cost cutting Disney regime that made ""The Aristocats"" three years earlier and ""The Rescuers"" three years later; and that it has far more life than both of these films put together.It IS the cost-cutting that would damn this film, and it's liveliness that redeems it.  (That, and Peter Ustinov's vocal performance as Prince John.) I can't even find it in my heart to condemn the Southern voices scattered throughout Sherwood Forest and Nottingham - replacing a human sheriff with a lupine one is such a violent change that the use of expressions like, ""Aw, geez, Nutsy,"" seems trivial by comparison.  At any rate I found the voices far less irritating than Kevin Costner's drawl in HIS version of Robin Hood.The animation is mostly good but without the stand-out brilliance of, say, ""The Jungle Book"".  There are a few scenes that look as if they belong on television (which is a problem shared with the next five animated features that Disney made).  The children are more cloying than usual with Disney and we see too much of them.  That's about it with the carping.  All in all it's cheerful, it's shameless, it's hard to resist."
12,Robin Hood,,1 June 2000,A brilliant piece of animation tells a timeless tale,"Arguably the best pre-""Little Mermaid"" Disney film, ""Robin Hood"" takes the characters from past Disney films and features such as Baloo (Jungle Book) and Rabbit (the Pooh films) and casts them in a classic re-telling of the popular Robin Hood fable.  While not as historical as Kevin Costner's big to-do, nor always as laugh-out-loud ridiculous as Mel Brooks' affair, Disney's effort comes off as amiable and very likable.  It's very much a product of its times but has a timeless quality that is unmatched, really, and the humor doesn't date itself as quickly as some of the jokes in recent Disney features have.  The voice acting (as in almost every Disney film) is superb, but contains very few outstanding stars (Peter Ustinov's role is especially well-done, however).  All in all, a film well-deserving of all the praise it receives."
13,Robin Hood,10,28 June 2006,The best Disney film ever made?,"As above. Don't you ever wonder what the fascist, communist-hating Mr. Disney would have thought about bringing such an inherently socialist tale to the silver screen under his life's work's label? I know I do. Robin Hood quite explicitly makes the rich and royal people of England out to be total crooks, and the poor workers out to be heroes in a Marxist fashion. ""Stealing from the rich and giving to the needy."" Indeed. The adventurous Sherwood Forest hero Robin Hood who did so was my very first crush. Luckily, I have since then outgrown my infatuation for animals. Although I can look back and see that he still is quite the fox.I maintain there are subtle elements of English humour that shine through in Disney's Robin Hood, and maybe that is why I like it so much. It may also be the hysterical comedic sidekicks like Sir Hiss. Whatever it is, this is without a doubt the best story of Robin Hood told on film, even though it's a cartoon aimed for kids. Good songs, good fast-paced action (that archery contest at the medieval fair was genius), interesting characters and nicely animated sets. All the characters have been translated into appropriate and symbolic animals. If you haven't thought about that before, do it next time you watch this film.Maid Marion is perhaps one of the weakest female Disney characters, but then, they have never been known to be very dimensional or showed much range other than when they are the protagonists (like Ariel), and Marion is not oneshe is a supporting character to the awesome Robin Hood and that is enough for this film.Robin Hood is Disney film that's stuck with me through the years and its only rival for best Disney film of all time is perhaps Aladdin."
14,Robin Hood,8,2 May 2006,"Great animation, OK story","*Contains a very minor spoiler*Robin Hood is one of the greatest Disney films made, and I applaud Disney for their effort.The story is a little different than what I expected. I knew it would have a happy ending, but I didn't get exactly what I expected. I'm glad that I didn't, because it would have had to have been 20 or so minutes longer otherwise. And a movie that is too long is not always a good thing, with the exception of the LOTR trilogy, which I love.That said, the voice cast is super. Brian Bedford as Robin Hood and Phil Harris - Baloo in The Jungle Book - (RIP) as Little John. They were the best in the cast, and did their parts well. I can't remember any other voices, except George Lindsay who did Trigger's voice, one of the vultures. I mention him only because he appears on my favorite TV show, ""The Andy Griffith Show"" as Goober, Gomer's cousin.Anyway, Robin Hood is a great film. I recommend to people of all ages.My Score: 8/10."
15,Robin Hood,10,25 August 2006,A proud flick...,"Disney's 1973 animated feature ""Robin Hood"" takes place in Sherwood Forest, near which is now Birmingham in England. Here, we see and hear about the famous story of Robin Hood, who, as many of y'all know, stole from the rich and had given to the poor. It's a very exciting story which the folks at Disney made into an animated film; for instance, we have a fox taking the role here.What I like about this film: It's terrific. Disney does an excellent job with the old films; quality animation, many being based on fairy tales that were read to us as little children, and nothing but 100% family fun!!!!!These thoughts have made me have a go at this movie! ""Robin Hood"" is one Disney flick that will never be forgotten and will live in our hearts for centuries to come. :-)10/10"
16,Robin Hood,8,30 November 2003,A nostalgia trip,"When I was about four or five years old I used to watch this film almost every day in my day care. Then a couple of weeks ago I was discussing with my friend about animation movies and it came up that he had this important piece of my childhood on VHS. So of course I borrowed it and watched it for the first time in about 13 years. I remembered surprisingly many scenes.Watching this movie wasn't as big event as it was years ago, but I still find it quite enjoyable. There were some funny mistakes in the translation from English to Finnish, but nothing crucial. I think I'll watch this a couple of times again for the old times sake before I give the tape back to my friend. :) 8/10"
17,Robin Hood,,25 March 2001,"Great Film,Horrible Animation","Robin Hood itself is great.None of the jokes are dated and the character designs are some of the best I've ever seen for ""furries"".The songs are nice,too.The main problem is the animation.It,in a word,stinks.Then again,all of the films from about the beginning of the 1960's to The Little Mermaid were done in this ""sketchy"" style,so I could cut them some slack if it weren't for the fact that it's pretty gritty.Sometimes you can see animators pencil marks,too-they shouldn't have let the Cleanup Department slack off!Also,sometimes the characters in one particular scene don't match what they look like in rest of the film.For example,in one scene during the ""Oo-de-lally"" song,we see Robin Hood and Little John from a distance running away from the Sheriff's goons,Robin Hood doesn't have his shoes on!You just see his back feet(Or is that paws?).In another scene in which Robin Hood is dressing up in costume to steal money from Prince John he has whiskers!So to sum it up;If you don't mind crude animation and pointless,fixable mistakes then you'll enjoy this film!If you DO mind,stay away."
18,Robin Hood,7,12 November 2000,One of my favorite Disney flicks.,"I was raised on and by this movie.  I worshiped it and still do because there's nothing else like it out there.  It's a clever and colorful adaptation of the Robin Hood legend with a zoofull of fun characters.  It was made during the lull period, after classics like Sleeping Beauty and Lady and the Tramp, but before the Era of Mermaid, so ""Robin Hood"" has that sketchy, drawn look like ""The Jungle Book"" and others.  But it's cute and endearing, and remains one of my all time favorites.  It's true that lots of Furry Artists have tainted and soiled it with X-Rated ""Art"" (I use the term loosely here...), but it is possible to filter that out and enjoy this movie by itself.  Any kid with imagination will love Disney's ""Robin Hood"" and any critic will be able to appreciate the studio's inventive take on this well-traversed tale.  It's a classic."
19,Robin Hood,7,30 December 2012,"Animated version based on  famous character filled with  musical numbers ,  entertainment and fun","Again Robin Hood and his Merry Men but this time they are a menagerie!

Though Richard eventually returned from battle and foiled John's rebellion, John eventually became king anyway after Richard's untimely death (1199) in battle without an heir. Queen Eleanor supported John against rival claimants until her death in 1204. Other versions about this famous personage are the following : the classical (1936) ¨The Adventures of Robin Hood ¨ by Michel Curtiz with Errol Flynn , Olivia De Havilland , Basil Rathbone , Alan Hale , ¨Robin Hood and his Merrie men ¨(1952) by Ken Annakin with Richard Todd and Peter Finch ; ¨Sword of Sherwood Forest (1960) by Terence Young with Richard Greene , Richard Pasco and Peter Cushing ; ¨Robin Hood price of thieves (1991) ¨ by Kevin Reynolds with Kevin Costner , Alan Rickman and Morgan Freenan , the same year was exhibited ¨Robin Hood¨ by John Irvin with Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman but was a flop though the critics considered best adaptation . Furthermore , recent and revisionist version titled ¨Robin Hood¨(2010) by Ridley Scott with Russell Crowe , Cate Blanchet and Oscar Isaac ."
20,Robin Hood,10,1 January 2007,"Wonderful, but so underrated","It really makes you wonder why can't Disney do more movies like this? I thought this was one of the most wonderful of any film that Disney ever made. Of course, the people of today do two things with this masterpiece: leave it unnoticed, or bash it to the ground, so they can watch some overrated stuff. Backgrounds: supreme, wonderful. Character designs: Done by the oh-so-wonderful Don Bluth, plus, this film has the most funniest villains ever to be shown on the silver screen (who wouldn't laugh at that mama's boy, Prince John?) and it as all kinds of emotion here: cute, mushy romance, a bit of drama here and there, and lots and lots of humor. Also, that little rabbit kid, Skippy, is one of the most adorable cartoon kids I've ever seen. One last things I'd like to add: the songs, some catchy and fun ""Phony King of England"" while some are really morose ""Not in Nottingham"". Overall, I give it two thumbs up."
21,Robin Hood,10,20 February 2001,Best animated movie ever.,"I watched this movie every day after school as a child, but unfortunatly we had it on BETA and when our BETA machine broke we were not able to find it on VHS.  I eventually forgot about the movie until it came on TV recently and I rushed out to buy it on DVD.  This is the only disney animation, or any animation for that matter, that i feel is worth owning on DVD."
22,Robin Hood,9,6 June 2006,The Best Version of Robin Hood,"Robin Hood is definitely in my Top 10 Disney movies list.Everybody I know loves this movie .It is the best version I've seen.You won't get bored during it I promise.First off, you've got the heroes : Robin Hood and Little John then you've got the heroine :the pretty Maid Marian , and last but not least there's the villain :the very funny Prince John and Sir Hiss. There's even some good songs like : ""O De Lally"" , ""Love"" ,""The Phony King of England"" , and ""Not in Nottingham"".Finally there's some action and romance.Robin Hood will not disappoint you."
23,Robin Hood,8,10 October 2002,A classic Disney movie,"When you talk about Disney movies with someone the first ones named are, for example, ""Beauty and the Beast"" and so on. And when you name ""Robin Hood"" (generally) people say: ""It's one of the worst movies ever"". The thing is, they are unfair. OK, maybe the animation isn't that good and has its flaws, but when you see it you forget everything they told you and enjoy as a child. Really, actually it's much better than many kiddie movies that promised to be great and finally they only promoted toys (do I have to name them?). But the best is that it has that classic Disney spirit that you can find in so many classics like ""The Jungle Book"", ""Bambi"". It has some really good characters (specially Prince John- when you see it you'll know why), some songs are really good (""Not in Nottingham"")and you have a really good time watching it. So forget any nasty comments, rent it and enjoy one of the most (unfairly) overlooked Disney movies of all times.It is much better than many people think, and all because it isn't famous."
24,Robin Hood,,6 May 2000,"The greatest Disney has ever made, and will ever make!","Robin Hood is the funniest, most beautiful and all in all the greatest movie Disney has ever made.  It is also the most underappreciated.  It is constantly being bashed for trivial reasons (The animals have American accents. etc...) All the characters are beautifully animated, especially Maid Marion and Robin Hood.  The backgrounds are also gorgeous, especially in the ""Love"" scene.  The music is beautiful, especially in Love and Not in Nottingham.The dialog is witty and smart.  Prince John and Sir Hiss definately have some of the funniest lines.  Prince John is the best villian ever made by Disney (Ursula from Little Mermaid is a close second). I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes love, action, comedies, or just a good movie!"
25,Robin Hood,10,16 March 1999,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS,"This is one of my two favourite cartoons. It's just great. I think it's the best Disney movie, there's not ""too much"" of anything. The songs are funny, the characters are perfect, there are few who wouldn't be really necessary, but they don't hinder the story. In overall, it's a movie every kid should see. I saw it about fifty times now, I watch it few times a year, but I still laugh at it!"
26,Robin Hood,,14 July 2003,Passable Disney version of the old chestnut.,"This Disney version of Robin Hood has one difference to the live action versions: the characters are played by animals. Beyond that, it follows the usual storyline in the familiar way.Robin Hood (a fox) and his best friend Little John (a bear) spend their days and nights stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. The Sherriff of Nottingham (a wolf) is out to catch them, on the orders of Prince John (a lion) and his slimy sidekick Sir Hiss (a snake). Incorporated into this is the blossoming romance between Robin Hood and his childhood sweetheart Maid Marian (a vixen).The voicing of the main characters is OK, although the Texan accents seem unsuitable for 10th century Sherwood Forest. The guy voicing the Sherriff of Nottingham doesn't really get away with it, though Phil Harris (of Baloo-the-Bear fame in The Jungle Book) is a bit more acceptable because he has an easy, laid-back voice that has enough charisma to help you to forgive its inappropriateness for this particular character and this particular setting. Peter Ustinov is great as Prince John.The animation is good but not exceptional, and the narrative has a few splendid moments (a robbery on the royal stagecoach, an archery contest, a raid on Nottingham Castle) separated by some drawn out, tedious episodes. On the whole, this is a passable experience, but not really one of the studio' finest hours. Still, for Disney completists or fans of the Robin Hood legend, there's enough here to keep you entertained."
27,Robin Hood,5,31 December 2014,"Good for the 70s but a far, far cry from classic Disney","""Robin Hood"" is a very dull film but one that kids will no doubt enjoy. I think much of this is because kids don't think like many adults. Many adults will see the film and think ""wow....this is not nearly as good as the REALLY good Disney films like BAMBI, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and LITTLE MERMAID""--but I cannot imagine most 6-8 year-olds thinking this way. Nor can I imagine most kids hating the music--although lines like ""Oodelally, Oodeelally Golly What a Day"" are truly insipid and annoying. And, kids won't likely think ""Wow...the classic Warner Brothers film with Errol Flynn is a bazillion times better than this dull picture""--but this is clearly true. My feeling is that this film is a great way to illustrate the doldrums in which Disney Studio was in at the time. The film simply isn't in the same league as their better films."
28,Robin Hood,7,28 August 2013,"A charming little gem, if far from perfect","""Robin Hood"" was made at a strange transit point in animation history, long after the Golden Age of Cartoons yet still some time before the renewed interest in animation brought about by Disney, Pixar and others. Moreover, it was one of the first animated features made in the awkward period just after Walt Disney had died, a period renowned for being Disney's creative nadir.Many of the criticisms of the era can be rallied against ""Robin Hood"". The pace is off sometimes, and the plot itself isn't very cohesive (then again, the original legend is essentially a cycle of various stories and episodes). Many of the characters look like carbon copies of designs from earlier Disney films, and indeed whole sequences feature animation re-used from productions as far back as ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"".Yet for all that's going against it, ""Robin Hood"" strangely seems to work. For one thing, it has a sheer charm and spirit to it that few films can boast, and the strong appeal of the original source material arguably helps as well. In addition to it generally being a fun film, it has some good songs, including the soothing ballads ""Love"" and ""Not in Nottingham"" and the catchy ""Oo-de-Lally"" and ""Whistle Stop"". While it can't be classed as highly as the likes of ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Robin Hood"" is definitely worth a watch."
29,Robin Hood,2,30 October 2010,Oh boy oh boy....,"I don't like this movie.I'm not alone in my distaste for Robin Hood. During its making, whispers spread among the staff (Ward Kimball and director Wolfgang Reitherman at least are recorded as complaining to each other). This, to me, is the absolute nadir of finance driven animated trash, akin to a Shrek sequel in artistry. To its credit, though, it is handled by master animators and designers, but this is hindered by the fact that every good piece of animation has to be reused once more to save time.As a Robin Hood adaptation, this one is quite far from its source material. Rather than the legendary folk hero, we get a pussified interpretation who dresses up in drag rather than resort to heroics and trots about carelessly so that he and Phil Harris are easily ambushed by a troop of run cycles. Did I mention cycles? Anyway, Peter Ustinov at least lends some comic voice acting to Prince John, but he doesn't exactly make for much of a villain. Phil Harris plays Baloo as Little John, and three films with Baloo is a bit much for me. Sir Hiss is Kaa...and that's all anyone can say. Maid Marion and her faithful steward Bess...I mean ""Clucky""...are basically useless and oblivious to what's going on around them. Pat Buttram's kind of enjoyable as the Sheriff, but, again, it's hard to take any of these villains seriously on any level when they're all played for cheap laughs. None of the characters endear much, and at least half are basically reused characters from past Disney projects.As for the plot...there is no plot.Instead, we get an aimless series of episodes that advance nothing and provide nothing but cheap, largely unfunny gags. One finds it hard to thrill over Robin Hood garbed in drag when we want to see him doing something masculine and likable. The party sequence in the middle is a masterpiece of suck, tethering together reused animation from The Aristocats, Snow White, and The Jungle Book while basically wasting the audience's time with a lousy song that I can't even recall at the moment. Wrapping it all up is a bit of exposition that essentially skips over the climax of the story, like a final insult to its stupid, stupid audience that will buy into anything with the Disney name.Moving on to animation, this film features all the masters of the last few films, who normally elevate even mediocre material like The Aristocats, and they do contribute a few impressive pieces to this. Milt Kahl does a fun and technically tricky bit with the Sheriff where he bounces down the street in perspective in a very characterized way. The problem is that it proceeds to be reused TWICE. Unfortunately, the rest of the animation is so occupied by walk cycles and reused animation and COPIED animation from films past that whatever virtues are contained wear out their welcome and good pieces are harder to come by.To be fair, the design values aside from the budget cheating are solid, and even with the appalling number of shortcuts the animation is never any less than well crafted otherwise. But what's the takeway? No breakthroughs are made on a technological or artistic level, no characters stand out, no scenes make an impression, and I swear the only bits I can remember are the thumb sucking and the fact that Robin Hood's anthropomorphized character design kind of looks like the primary inspiration for ""furries"" (do NOT look that term up).I've heard from a few folks who worked on this, and have never, in my entire life, heard any of them say they were proud of it. The thing's a cynical sucker punch to anyone who enjoys Disney films, a cesspool of mediocrity and disrespect that doesn't even think its supporters are worth giving competent production values. Yogi Bear and The Flintstones are more exciting to me. Heavy Traffic from the same year also took shortcuts, but out of necessity rather than greed, and actually managed to be an excellent film where its rough animation worked for its themes. I'm not against cheap animation, and think such limitations can actually lead to some of the most interesting animation around when the people involved are putting their all into wrangling descent expressiveness and motion out of their material.But Robin Hood is just half-assed. Usually, The Black Cauldron is brought up when discussing bad Disney movies, but that film had something called originality to some extent in the context of Disney's work. Robin Hood is, for lack of a better term, animated inbreeding."
30,Robin Hood,,26 October 2004,Cast Sadness,"I was looking at the members of this excellent cast, and I noticed that most of them were deceased. I found a bunch of great music by Roger Miller other than Robin Hood that I enjoy very much as well.I remember this movie because it was the first one that made me cry when I was a kid. I still have that same kind of feeling when I go back and watch it.Sadly it took me a very long time to greatly appreciate this movie for the great piece of work it really is, those who took part in the making of the film, and the voice acting of the characters.Thanks to IMDb for having such great info on this film."
31,Robin Hood,10,27 November 2012,The best Robin Hood ever made,"Okay, I have to admit that I haven't seen many films about Robin Hood in my entire life, but I consider this one to be the most entertaining and enjoyable version of this same story, despite all the obvious liberties that could be expected from a Disney movie.The animation was quite good, with very cute and appealing designs.All the character from this movie were very likable, the gags were funny, the songs were catchyActually, I think that every single aspect from this movie was quite charming and well, having all the necessary elements to be considered a classic for the whole family.In my opinion, this is the most underrated Disney film, deserving much more appreciation and recognition."
32,Robin Hood,8,21 June 2011,"Sometimes ups, outnumber the downs. But not in Nottingham","Robin Hood is one of the better Disney films to have been right around a few years after Walt's passing and it doesn't seem any different than if Walt had been in the studio with his animators. Robin Hood has lovable characters, funny characters, and villains you either love to hate or love to love. I personally just love Prince John and how he acts tough and clever yet put him in peril and he runs away like a coward. His sidekick Sir Hiss is even smarter than he is and yet they both seem to be the perfect villain and apprentice. The Sheriff of Nottingham was probably not as likable but he also fits the perfect villain as well.Robin Hood also doesn't run too long and should be a hit with parents who don't want to sit around and be bored. No annoying songs except maybe the ""Love"" song but other than that the songs are easy to relate to with the movie. This isn't one of the best Disney films but it is like finding a diamond in the rough."
33,Robin Hood,6,24 January 2010,"ROBIN HOOD (Wolfgang Reitherman, 1973) **1/2","It was perhaps inevitable for the Walt Disney Studios to make an antropomorphic animated feature out of the adventures of the legendary Sherwood Forest outlaw, yet rather superfluous considering their own superior 1952 live-action rendition (with which I also intend to re-acquaint myself this Christmas  particularly in view of star Richard Todd's recent passing). In spite of the film's somewhat maligned reputation as the unit's least effort from the 1970s, I used to like this one as a kid and, to be fair, it remains eminently watchable (if hardly stimulating) even now  thanks largely to the enthusiastic voice 'performances' of Peter Ustinov as Prince John (depicted as a lion and, amusingly, a mama's boy!) and Terry-Thomas as his reptilian (thus a snake, appropriately named Sir Hiss) but long-suffering sidekick/patsy. In typical Disney fashion, however, the obligatory romance is a drag (while also throwing in a bit of 'child' interest); similarly, the oppression of Prince John's rule is treated with excessive sentimentality. That said, Robin (in the guise of a fox) is suitably wily when dealing with John, Hiss and the Sheriff Of Nottingham (appearing in the form of a wolf)  notably when he robs the royal carriage (dressed up as a gypsy), the famed archery contest (with his features hidden under a stork's countenance) and the finale in which the Prince's income is pinched en masse and swung along ropes from his balcony. As for the ""Merrie Men"", Little John is a bear (voiced by Phil Harris, in a virtual reprise of his Baloo characterization from THE JUNGLE BOOK [1967]  the film, in fact, feels closest to this one in style and approach), Friar Tuck a badger (dialogue spoken by Andy Devine) and Allen-a-Dale a crooning rooster who also acts as Chrous to the proceedings. Incidentally, though an icky love song (unimaginatively called ""Love"") may have been intended as the musical centerpiece here, Little John's bouncy ""The Phony King Of England"" and Allen-a-Dale's wistful ""Not In Nottingham"" are actually much more rewarding numbers."
34,Robin Hood,8,10 July 2007,A very charming movie,"The 21st animated Disney classic is one of the funniest classics by Disney.This movie always amused me. I've always loved it my entire life and I will always enjoy it.""Robin Hood"" isn't among the most underrated Disney classics but, just like any other Disney classic, it is underrated as well.""Robin Hood"" might not be one of the most technically perfect Disney classics but it is very enjoyable and charming.Some people complain about this movie because of its simple picture quality and stuff like that, as if it was terrible. But is it Disney at its worst? Absolutely not! Fortunately this movie is very well accepted in general. Many people love it (including me) and few people seem to dislike it.This great movie has classic humor, British humor, enchantment, charm, romance, drama, nice songs, funny villains and even some depressing moments. But most of the time this movie is deliciously hilarious.For example, the entire sequence of the Archery Tournament's destruction is unbelievably hilarious and hysterical. The whole part of the song ""The Phony King of England"" is also hilarious, which continues with the Sheriff and Hiss singing it.These are just some of the most hilarious moments. I could go on, but it would take forever to mention all of them.The songs are all very nice: ""The Phony King of England"", ""Love"", ""Not in Nottingham"", ""Robin Hood"" and even the whistle song at the opening credits.About the characters, they're very pleasant in general. Robin Hood is a clever fox, charming and a big joker. Little John is simple as a bear should be and has also a great sense of humor. Friar Tuck is funny and kind hearted. Lady Kluck is hilarious. Maid Marian is a charming female character. Alan-A-Dale is a great minstrel. The bunnies are cool characters.The villains are funny in general. Prince John is funny but also heartless, very evil, greedy, ambitious, explosive, a traitor, a tyrant and a cowardly ""crybaby"". The Sheriff of Nottingham, sometimes referred to as ""Bushel Britches"", isn't as mean as Prince John, but he's just as heartless and greedy as P.J.Hiss is a comic relief. He's a hilarious snake, used and abused by Prince John. Hiss isn't really evil or dangerous, he's more kind of ""I want to be evil but I just can't"". In that subject he's very much like Mr. Snoops from ""The Rescuers"".""Robin Hood"" has also the precious help of legendary actors to voice the characters: Phil Harris, Terry-Thomas, Peter Ustinov, Andy Devine, John Fiedler, Brian Bedford, Roger Miller, Pat Buttram, J. Pat O'Malley and Barbara Luddy.This should definitely be on Top 250."
35,Robin Hood,,10 December 2006,"One of the Funniest, Cutest, and most amazing animated films ever.","Robin Hood and Maid Marrien are foxes, Little John is a bear, Frier Tuck is a badger, The sheriff is a wolf, and King John is a lion who has a snake partner named Sir Hiss in Disney's animated adaptation of the tale of the most famous socialist, and it is an amazing and delightful film. The story is pretty much your usual Robin hood legend, he and Little John steal from the rich to give to the poor which includes Frier Tuck, and a cute family of rabbits, all while our hero is eying his past love, Main Marrien. Meanwhile, King John wants to foil his plans with the help of Sir Hiss and the sheriff of Nottingham. There's a goofy rooster sidekick who is delightful in helping stop the bad guys. To make things even cooler, there's a minstrel Rooster who narrates the whole tale through song. This is an amazing film full of color, wit, romance, excitement, humor, music, and action. The visuals are overall perfect, despite some animated shots recycled from previous Disney films which i don't mind. The voice work fits perfect with the characters expressions and tone. The films has a couple of fairly intense sequences(both of them involving the sheriff and both of them in the middle and toward the end of the film) but overall, the parts work well. As for whether or not the characters are adapted adequately, you'll have to be the judge of that. To me, it doesn't matter because i love the way all the characters are. The King John character is hilarious when somebody mentions his mom. Frier Tuck is sweet as the feeble but kind elder of the monastery. The sheriff, despite being kind of cruel in a couple parts, is interesting enough to be memorable. Maid Marrien as the damsel in distress should keep viewers on the edge of their seat. Little John is not so little, but manages to be the same kind of character as Baloo in the jungle book, in other words, AWESOME. And of course, Robin Hood. The best character in the film. The film is about him, and yet when it was over, I missed him. When I was three years old, I fell in love with him. He's just, amazing. The music is also great. Its very memorable and catchy. I wouldn't be surprised if someone were caught humming the music five years from now. Anyways, this is a classic. If you haven't seen it already, check it out. If you have children, watch it with them. It'll become a family favorite before you know it."
36,Robin Hood,,7 September 2006,Hiss Was The Best Part Of The Movie,"The clever little snake, Hiss, was the best part of the movie. He plays Prince John's sidekick and he is absolutely hilarious. I grew up watching this movie and always had a soft spot for hiss. I wonder where I could find hiss merchandise? If anyone knows, let me know! I'm curious to know if there are any other ""hiss fans"" out there. He is probably the funniest cartoon character that I have ever encountered. As far as the other characters go, some of them are corny and boring. The movie itself is really good, and teaches wonderful values. The dialog is outdated because it was made in the early thirties, but it still pertains to world events (stealing from the rich to help the poor.)"
37,Robin Hood,10,10 July 2006,MISSING SCENES?? help me help me,"Does anyone remember a scene where robin hood is about to be hanged by prince john's henchmen when he's saved by an arrow that cuts the noose at the last second (or something like he's about to have his head chopped off, and it turns out that Little John is the hangman in disguise)?! Because I really vividly remember this scene, but when I watched a DVD of this movie last week this scene wasn't in the film. Also, the film felt shorter to me before I even realized that I had remembered this scene; was it cut out of the DVD versions so as not to scare children? Am I totally imagining this?! Hellllllllllllp meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
38,Robin Hood,10,25 March 2006,"Best Robin Hood of all time, the Disney team at it's best.","The Disney Robin Hood would have to be the greatest Robin Hood ever and the rest of this movie is just as great. It's got everything a good movie needs; action, adventure, romance, humour and most of all a good plot all the way through. There is not one character in this movie that annoys you; every one of them is likable. The way all these well known and some not so well known characters are portrayed by animals is excellent. Robin is suited perfect as a fox, as is Prince John as a cowardly lion. This movie is timeless which makes it great for all ages and genders from any generation. It has pretty good animation, especially for when it was made (1973). Although I know a lot of people would disagree with me I would have to say that this is the best animated Disney movie made (and yes I have seen Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid etc). I say this because during my early childhood and even now, Robin Hood is the most frequently viewed Disney movie for me. I would recommend this movie for anyone and everyone. It is a pure classic."
39,Robin Hood,8,14 March 2006,Old but still good!,"I loved this movie as a kid. I knew the lines off by heart, and amazingly, I still do! Watching this movie again as an adult, I can see that there are problems with continuity and animation and the like. However, I noticed that the story is still sweet and funny and romantic. And I still liked it even though it wasn't as song heavy as, say, the Little Mermaid, which is the type of Disney movies I tend to enjoy.I especially noticed the good voice acting, by characters such as Prince John and Robin Hood himself.As long as you don't try to tear this movie apart while watching, or compare it to other versions of Robin Hood, this movie is still very enjoyable and entertaining."
40,Robin Hood,9,7 June 2005,Greatest retelling of the story!,"No matter how many bad reviews there are about this movie, they're all wrong.I've seen this movie a good 10 times as a child, and I still remember it being the greatest retelling of the legend... ever! I'm sure you've heard from everyone on the board saying things like, ""recycling of characters,"" or ""Redoing of old scenes""... even with all that, Disney told one hell of a story, and there's no arguing that.What we have here is an obvious lack of taste... after all, it did win a golden screen award... very nice! Also, let's not forget that it was made in 1973; so don't get in my face about the animation... that's just how things were.For all you naysayers, I say this: take this one for a spin if you love classic Disney.10/10"
41,Robin Hood,9,16 September 1999,"DISNEY, in a single word","I enjoy this movie now as much as the first time I saw it in the early 80's. The movie is spectacular, the characters are fun and are noticeably distinct, and the animation is Disney at their finest,... smooth and nonetheless lifelike, compared to other movies I've seen by them.  Maybe not backed by handfuls of awards and nominations,  but more than worthy of an unforgettable classic that you'll find yourself attached to from the second the movie begins!All in all, you can't escape the fact that Robin Hood is more ""Disney"" than their newest titles will ever be.  I know it and Disney knows it."
42,Robin Hood,8,17 September 2000,Pretty decent Disney movie,"Let's face it. Not everybody likes their Disney movie to be big musicals. Modern Disney also uses too many computer images, and their sense of humor has gotten really bad lately. Here with Robin Hood, you get the same laughs over and over because the humor doesn't seem to date as badly. What Robin Hood lacks in animation and story, it makes for in charm. And Robin and Marian make a very cute couple. While not as grand as the classics or as hip as the moderns, this is still good family viewing that gets nowhere near as hokey as modern Disney."
43,Robin Hood,10,27 September 2006,Not much maybe...but it's my childhood personified,"Perhaps I'm being favorable to it because...well, just because it was innocent and wholesome during a time when I was grateful for anything like it. I'm sure if you compare all of it's elements such as musical score, animation, plot and all, it tallies to be sub-par Disney. But to me there's no greater Disney film. Just because when I was little, King John and Sir Hiss made me laugh, Maid Marrion made me smile and blush, Robin made me feel fearless and roguish. All the clever one liners and witticisms made me chuckle. The sad parts had me bleary-eyed. And in the end I wanted to be like Robin Hood. Now I've seen the Little Mermaid, Aladdin etc... They're all fine films with just as much wit and a little more polish. But their characters will always be alien to me, whereas, these old bizarre fading characters from a half-forgotten film about silly mawkish subjects as courtly love and chivalry are my most prized. Maybe it can be written off as simple nostalgia, if so, then amen. But when I see my little baby sister watching it, I see the same reactions I always had..."
44,Robin Hood,6,8 May 1999,An unfortunately weak film with a few good points.,"While this is great fun for kids, as an adult furry fan, I do have to face facts about this film.Namely, this is indeed the weakest of the Disney animated features.  The story structure is completely disjointed, being basicly a series of sequences patched together almost hastily. The characters, especially the title character, are largely cardboard with little depth.  The anachronisms interfere with the atmosphere of the film.  If they're using furries for the characters, then it would have made better sense to keep the medieval settings as authentic as possible to make it feel more believable.  The American accents for some of the characters like Little John, Alan a Dale and the Sheriff feel most inappropriate for an English setting and for the most part, using American Country music for the soundtrack just clashes too hard.  Finally, the animation is unforgivably slapdash for Disney's standards, with reused animation sequences predominating the footage, giving the whole film a cheap look.On the plus side, the characters, especially Robin Hood and Maid Marian, are beautifully rendered and an artistic inspiration for funny animal fans for decades.  Also, the song, ""Not in Nottingham"" is quite haunting for a country music song and some of the dialogue is quite witty.All in all, kids will enjoy this film as they probably wouldn't notice the flaws, but I would wish for a D2V sequel, as far as writing is concerned. They have an opportunity for big improvements."
45,Robin Hood,1,27 November 2006,It stinks!,"The Hanna/Barberaism of the Disney studios continued (after the plodding and dull ""Aristocats"") with this lame excuse to make money off of kids. A few other reviewers have pointed out the jerky and often grinding-to-a-slow-crawl plot and the characters that were more wooden than Pinocchio. What bothered me, and I mean what bothered me to the point of wincing when it was originally released, was how the people at Disney were simply plum out of ideas. You really can appreciate Walt Disney's genius at telling a story, and the team he left behind simply couldn't pull it off. So, they decided to recycle some old animation in the hopes that no one would notice. First, they put some clothes on Baloo, then they use animated scenes from Snow White, the Aristocats, and the Jungle Book just to cut corners and hope that no one noticed. What were they thinking? Even though Maid Marian's dance moves were so obviously from Snow White, at least that film was older than the kids who went to see this movie. But to rip off animation from the previous two movies? Particularly the high-points of the previous two movies? The only good thing they did was use the Hamster Dance in the opening credits. Pity they didn't have any hamsters dancing, though. Just recycled clips from the movie itself."
46,Robin Hood,8,17 June 2012,One of the best Disney films ever.,"Personally, this is my favorite out of the other classic Disney films. The last time I have watched this was 6 years ago, and I still remember it even after all these years. It's Robin Hood played by a fox, with great music and fun characters. This is one of those movies you watch and love, and still love even after a couple of years. This is a film with not much drama in it and there's no need to over-analyze anything because it's the way it is. It's light and you watch it for the fun of it. All I can say is, this movie is worth watching. You will definitely enjoy yourself. This movie might be a cartoon, but that doesn't mean adults won't like it. It's a movie for everyone."
47,Robin Hood,10,18 June 2002,One of the most overlooked Disney Movies,"When people start talking about their favorite Disney animated movies, this one, for some reason, never seems to come up.  I don't know why.  It has great physical humor, wonderful characters, a good story, and some great songs.  Try not to laugh at the song ""The Phony King of England"" or hold back tears during the sad ""Not in Nottingham."""
48,Robin Hood,,13 August 2000,"Not Disney`s finest hour, but still very good","Robin Hood from 1973 is the Disney-version of the classic tale of Robin Hood, who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. This isn`t Disney`s best but it is still good and worth seeing. The animation is as always nice, the story is neat and the characters are good, but this movie`s biggest flaw lies in the musical department.  Almost all of the music is below average, not up to Disney`s usual standard and many times out of place in the medieval setting.  Disney also released Robin Hood on tape and the music found there is a lot better then the music in the movie. 8/10"
49,Robin Hood,6,8 March 2004,"Kind of cute, but empty and lazy too","Disney's animated version of `Robin Hood' isn't very well remembered, and it turns out that's for pretty good reason.  The concept is kind of cute, with a deliberately mannered comic take on the story, one decent song (`Not in Nottingham'), and famous character actors hamming it up in the familiar roles.  (The camp performances of Peter Ustinov, Terry-Thomas, and Carole Shelley are probably the standouts.)  But it isn't long before the film comes down with a critical case of the Hanna-Barberas, and after a while the empty script, lazy animation, and `Scooby-Doo'-esque chase scenes begin to be tiring.  The kids never seem to mind, but adults are likely to cringe more often than they'd like.  6 out of 10."
50,Robin Hood,7,15 February 2014,Underrated?,"Many hail Robin Hood (1973) as a wronged Disney film, but it's not hard to see why it's been forgotten. The characters aren't interesting, the story is like several episodes of a cheap Saturday morning cartoon strung together, and the music is lazy. (How the uninspired ""Love"" got an Academy Award nomination is beyond me.) Then there's the animation, which is among the crudest Disney ever produced for a feature. It also constantly reuses animation for earlier, better Disney films, from the groundbreaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) to the then recent Jungle Book (1967).About the only interesting elements are the villains, Prince John and Sir Hiss, whose old married couple style bickering proves entertaining.Stick to the Errol Flynn Robin Hood, which is beautifully shot and will have you feeling like a kid again. This is good for nostalgia, but little else."
51,Robin Hood,9,26 April 2011,The Fun Overshadows The Flaws,"Robin Hood, in terms of quality, is a very peculiar film. One thing is for sure, it has a boatload of problems that are both blatant and prominent. The animation is flat, many elements are recycled from earlier Disney films, the story is fragmented, Robin and Marian's relationship is given little establishment or development, the run time is waaaaaay too short and Robin doesn't get nearly enough screen time. All these problems are the essential formula for a sad excuse for a movie. That being said, I love this film. I love everything about it. I love the atmosphere. I love the characters. I love the humor. There is something about Robin Hood that just works; the question is what and how. Here's what I think: Disney's version of Robin Hood is not so much an adaptation of the legend, but a parody. A large majority of the characters are given large alterations, other than being anthropomorphic animals. The biggest example is the villain Prince John. The powerful, greedy tyrant is portrayed as a cowardly crybaby that can't overcome issues from his childhood. The Sheriff of Nottingham, a corrupted brute is portrayed as an obese, bumbling oaf. Friar Tuck, despite being a preacher has some traits one would hardly expect of a man of the church. The effect is hilarious. The entire cast has a lot of energy and make for some strong entertainment. Only Robin Hood himself is a somewhat accurate reflection of his legendary counterpart. But violence is substituted with a clamor for disguise. The cast and humor is aided through some very impressive and witty writing. This creates an incredible atmosphere of charm, whimsy and fun. It comes off as overwhelmingly campy, but it's supposed to be. The film says right from the get-go, ""this is our version and we're going to have fun with it."" Robin Hood has a smile on his face the entire movie, and his mood reflects on the audience. The effect is strange in that most of the films' problems actually work towards its advantage. The lackluster animation gives the movie a down to earth and rustic feel, appropriate for the setting and events. The recycled bits (due to budget cuts during the film's production) come off as a tribute to earlier Disney films and a mild nostalgia trip. Robin and Marian's rather prompt relationship works in a sense. We knew before the film started that Robin and Marian would fall in love, so why waste time with the tedious buildup. The flaws certainly glare once the film is over, but completely melt away when it's playing, even on repeated viewings. I've always believed that a film's actual quality is much more important than its likability and entertainment value. But for Robin Hood I think I'll make an exception. I'd go so far as to call Robin Hood a guilty pleasure, but I don't feel guilty at all."
52,Robin Hood,10,30 September 2007,Disney's red headed BIOLOGICAL child!,"I have loved this version of ""Robin Hood"" ever since I was a kid. All of the other ""Robin Hood"" movies I've seen I thought they were boring. One person said that it was the Disney company's secret shame; I really don't see why. This movie was the first Disney flick without the involvement of Walt Disney the man himself and, despite people thought it would be a flop, was a huge hit and the most popular Disney feature at it's time. It was also all the more a hit when it was re-released in the '80's. Another person said it was the best pre ""Little Mermaid"" film. I agree with them on that, as well as ""Brave Little Toaster"" and ""Great Mouse Detective"". So what I'm saying is don't judge this little gem by its animation: it really is an excellent movie."
53,Robin Hood,8,22 February 2007,My second favourite classic Disney! :),"I love this film because it shows kindness, fun, defending, escaping, disguising, being mean and romantic - all at the same time! :() Most Disney classics don't have these many adjectives to it and that's why I like it so much! I also love all the characters. I even admire the baddies - and that's saying something. The film is based on the story of Robin Hood and all the characters are animals! Robin Hood is a fox, Little John is a bear, etc. It shows Robin Hood stealing from the prince (!) and giving a birthday present to a little bunny! He is also hoping to win in an archery competition and see his love (Maid Marian) for the first time in ages. Can he win two things - the competition and Maid Marian's heart?I recommend this to people who love Robin Hood, daring attacks and defences, kind and fun characters and Disneys! Enjoy this lovely classic! :) ;) :()"
54,Robin Hood,7,15 October 2006,Fine movie:  great music!,"This is a fine animated Disney flick: in the same era as The Aritocats and The Jungle Book (both of which also have Phil Harris voicing a key character) and of similar quality.The quality of the animation is average for the era; but the storyline is above average: lots of good humor, based on the timeless story.But I want to draw attention to the Roger Miller songs: ""oo-de-lally"" and ""not in Nottingham"": both are fantastic tunes, but never seem to have gained the same fame as famous tunes from other animated movies. Roger Miller, of course, is most famous for his mega-hit ""King of the Road""."
55,Robin Hood,10,15 June 2006,"poor animation, great story","This movie was a staple of my childhood. However, Mr. Disney is probably rolling over in his grave at the poor quality of this animation. This film was made after his death. The animators were lazy and used many looped clips as well as recycled parts from other scenes and even other movies. The music and script were worthy of original animation. That being said I still own this movie on VHS and long for the day that I can find it on DVD. ""Robin Hood and Little John walkin' through the forest, laughin' back and forth at what the other had to say, never ever thinking' there was danger in the water they were drinkin' they just guzzled it down......."""
56,Robin Hood,7,13 March 2005,Fine story,"I watched this film last time couple of years ago, and I liked it very much. I don't know do I still like it, but at least I would like to watch the English dubbed version, because I have seen only the finish dubbed version.Story is the same, but characters little different. Robin Hood is a fox, Maid Marian is a vixen, little John a bear, Prince John a lion and Sheriff of Nottingham a wolf. I guess that sir Hiss is the changed name of Guy Gisborne.This is not one of the best Disney movies, but still very good. It has action, adventure, humor, romance and good songs. It was also the biggest hit in the box-office at the time than any other Disney movie before it. Still, I'm very surprised that the song 'Love' earned an Oscar nomination.As I said, I would like to watch the English dubbed version of this film."
57,Robin Hood,,26 August 1999,Best Disney Movie,"I watched Robin Hood again while I was babysitting today and I must say, it's my favourite Disney movie ever.  Just let me say, Robin Hood is one hot fox.  :)  That may sound weird, but it's true.  :)  AND, the littlest rabbit is the cutest Disney character."
58,Robin Hood,6,1 May 2016,A movie that I could write two reviews of because of my polarized opinion,"Despite my profile picture, I have a relative dislike towards Robin Hood, in the same just barely watchable realm as One Hundred and One Dalmatians. While I do admit that the characters and the songs are enjoyable and get deserved credit (despite some that have little purpose and need more), there are major historical inaccuracies that affect not the characters themselves (like in Pocahontas), but what they do. Robin Hood is set in 1192 (at least the ending is, when King Richard returned from the Third Crusades), but the movie features Happy Birthday, balloons, farthing coins, badminton, arrow shooters that are reminiscent of rifles (Trigger's bow and arrow is automatic, includes safety, and is called ""Old Betsy"", as if Trigger's successors would go on to invent firearms) and football player-esque guards (including a fight song during the ""beautiful brawl"" in Little John's words). The climax is also virtually nonexistent, leading from a castle escape to the cliché of a character faking death to fool the enemy, and then cutting straight to a wedding with nothing else. Did I mention that some of the animation is more obviously recycled than in other Disney movies?There is actually still hope for Robin Hood, as the Most Wanted Edition (and later the 40th Anniversary Edition) features deleted scenes including an Alternate Ending (you don't have to buy it to see these scenes, they're on YouTube). When I saw the Alternate Ending for the first time, I was baffled at how much better it is compared to the anticlimactic normal ending. Not only is there more climax and suspense overall, but there are some dark tones which contrast the rest of the film very well, and Maid Marian and King Richard get more screen time. The Sheriff of Nottingham isn't incarcerated in this ending (possibly because he acted only as an enforcer to John's laws, rather than acting of his liberated will), and even though there isn't Allan-A-Dale, I found more satisfaction with the Alternate Ending, so thank goodness it wasn't forgotten by Disney.Overall, I would give this a 5 for the normal ending and a 7 for the Alternate Ending, averaging to a 6. It isn't terrible, but it's the kind of film I'd expect to have a 6.7 instead of a 7.6."
59,Robin Hood,8,6 May 2007,"One of the weaker Disney films, but still a good time","This is one of the few Disney films I did not see as a kid. It was still enjoyable and still better than most of the movies out there. I really like the music especially when they used the staccato to give the viewer a sense of urgency. I was told right before I watched it by my friends I watched it with that this movie was made when Disney was in a lot of financial problems and I think that actually saved the movie, because without knowing that I would have just thought they were ripping off a lot of characters and voices, but it seems to be a little more forgivable given the financial situation. I really like having the rooster being a folk singer and it helped infuse a different feel to a story of this type. Since it was mostly a fairy tale the fold singer really melded the different genres together. In all honestly the best parts were the really quite little animals. They were supposed to be sappy were a cheap way of getting the viewer to feel bad for the situation and it worked extremely well. I actually enjoyed the animals and how ridiculous it was to have all of them in the same universe and playing off each extremely well. It is not my favorite Disney film, but it is still a Disney film, which makes it a lot of fun."
60,Robin Hood,10,20 July 2005,Classic Disney!,"I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities. The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear. Not to mention beautiful! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious Looney Tunes characters that we all love. in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen. In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do! If you like the original Looney Tunes and animated films then I strongly recommend that you watch this movie today!"
61,Robin Hood,4,7 July 2006,Definitely NOT one of Disney's best or even close,"The story is weak. The animation looks more like Hanna-Barbera second-rate TV animation than the quality Disney was known for prior to Walt Disney's death and the ""Little Mermaid""/""Lion King"" era. Let's be honest. Most of the animated films that came out of the Disney studios post ""Jungle Book"" up until ""Little Mermaid"" were quickly put together and seriously lacking in what the earlier animated films had. The only exceptions to this were ""The Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh"", which was a compilation of the Winnie-The-Pooh shorts shown in the 60s, and possibly ""The Fox And The Hound"". Disney did much better in 70s and 80s with re-releases of earlier films than new releases during this time period. Unfortunately, someone was not doing their job during that time. Sadly, the same thing has happened with the post-""Lion King"" animated films that Disney has made. I suppose it's asking too much that the quality of a Snow White or Pinocchio be seen in every one of Disney's animated films."
62,Robin Hood,9,26 September 2012,Great fun!,"OK so it was done on the cheap, taking many scenes from other Disney movies but still it's a great movie.The animation is a bit rough and ready because Disney was on a cost cutting exercise. Don't expect a polished finish like The Jungle Book but more like a straight to TV film.It must be said however that this is one of my favorite Disnesy films. It has a happy feel with catchy songs, great characters and a solid story.It's a real shame that Disney made this on a budget because if they spent their usual budget it would be one of their Classics! Top notch fun!"
63,Robin Hood,10,30 July 2012,"Best of the ""Classic"" Era Disney Animation Features","I have made a point now to watch/re-watch(a few) all the early/artistry-based Disney animation features, 'as this had been oft-described as the best overall animation ever produced. I have been astounded at how bad the drawing-paint looks in only one early Disney feature(""Alice in Wonderland""): it looks and plays as hollow. I have been newly informed and hugely impressed by the unfamiliar title of ""Sword and the Stone"", which is an excellent film start to finish.""Robin Hood"" stands apart/alone as almost perfect among the lot, starting with ""Snow White"" and ending with ""Rescuers""; I am not huge on the love-song(though I'll guess, for some, this is a highlight)...and still this film so impresses, from story-development, to look, to specific art in standout scenes/images: one is inspired with awe. 'An amazing presentation, the pinnacle of art-driven animation(versus cgi), and this will never be matched again.This film is a must see for all ages, and inspires on so many levels, from love to politics...all people should be persuaded to take this cinema experience to heart."
64,Robin Hood,8,8 June 2005,An interesting film from the post-Walt era,"Disney's Robin Hood (1973) was the second film released after Uncle Walt's death (the first was the Jungle Book-1968). I've always liked this film for Different reasons. When I was younger, I liked it because, well...it was Disney. Everything Disney was right in my eyes. Robin Hood was one of my favorite films as a small child. Recently, I saw it again on television after not seeing it for a very long time. Now I have a whole new set of reasons for why I thoroughly enjoy this film.Ken Anderson did something quite special with Robin Hood, he combined the elements of a traditional animated Disney feature with some creative ideas of his own.One element of both Disney animated features and shorts where the use of animals instead of people where telling an unoriginal story. The story of Robin Hood had been told in many live-action movies (with Earl Flynn's performance still the standard). In the Disney film, the animators used the obvious choice of a fox for the role of Robin Hood. Maid Marian had to be a Vixen (because inter-species love is really weird). A bear was a good choice for Robin's right hand man, because as we all know, fat people make perfect sidekicks.Another Disney tradition upheld was the great animation. Ever since Snow White, Disney has been the standard for great animation. Though other animation studios tried to duplicate Disney, they we're seldom successful. The animation in Robin Hood was no exception.Robin Hood was also a very original film for Disney. The film started with a Rooster that sang folks song and was kind of a hippie. In most movies about Robin Hood he was kind of this God figure that was untouchable. In this one, Robin Hood was just a regular guy that only wanted to help his people out. He had his dreams and ambitions and faults like everyone else.In closing, Robin Hood is a great family film. Children, teenagers, and adults can enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars."
65,Robin Hood,,5 October 2003,I just don't see it...,"I saw this one in the theater when it was released and enjoyed it thoroughly as a kid. In the mid 80's, with the advent of cable and home satellite dishes, I was able to watch it again as a teen. Now as a mother of three, I see it as a parent...I don't see what is merited in all the glowing comments.I understand that this is a children's movie, made for children with them in mind, so little things like the Sheriff of Nottingham sounding like he hails from Alabama shouldn't be a big deal. I'll let the country music and dialects slide in a time period when there was no ""New World"".The actors - Robin Hood was very well done. Of course Disney can Never go wrong with Phil Harris and Peter Ustinov was impeccable.The animation - What was wrong with the animators when they were unable to create new drawings for the opening credits? Everything except the shots of Alan A Dale were taken from the actual movie itself. I don't recall any Disney movie having done that before or since.Ever since I saw it again from a more mature perspective, this movie has always felt that, back in 1973, the Disney studios were on their last leg, artistically. What a shame it would be that 16 years would pass before they could recapture the magic they once had."
66,Robin Hood,8,10 March 2003,No flop,"Dull Disney flop? No way! One of my favourite Disney movies. It's different than the others, but that doesn't mean less good. I like everything about it, the characters and the story. I give it a 8 out of 10."
67,Robin Hood,9,20 November 2002,Great movie,"I´ve seen nearly all the Disney movies and I have to say that this one is the best so far. It does not only have good voices, but great animation and interesting characters as well. Even though it has some errors it´s still a good movie and can be watched over and over again."
68,Robin Hood,,24 October 2002,Ooh-de-lally! It's wonderful!,"This is one of my absolutely favorite Disney movies, and Prince John (voice by the fabulous Peter Ustinov) is my absolute favorite Disney character.This movie is hilarious -- and there's just about nothing funnier than Prince John's evil laugh -- ah-ha...AH-ha!"
69,Robin Hood,,30 July 2002,Disney animation?  What happened?,"Traditionally, Disney has always had the best animation and defines its ""classics"" based on the cast's chemistry and musical score.  This movie strikes out.  The cast is made up of good character actors, but the sorts of slapstick gags they have to pull off makes the movie look like nothing more than an 83 minute Saturday morning cartoon.  The music is twangy and the animation looks like it was done by Disney's junior animation department.Do yourself a favor and rent/buy the Jungle Book instead.  The cast is made up of some of the same actors, has more artistic animation and a strong musical score."
70,Robin Hood,,12 August 2001,Coen Brothers do Disney???,"What can be said? Structurely, this film is a mess. It feels more like a string of TV episodes put together to make a film. The characters are also one-dimentional and without motivation for what they do. And the cartoon drawing is rough and unpolished.But there is a charm about this flick that has yet to be entwined into any other Disney film made (with the possible exception of the Jungle Book). From the country songs to the quirky humour (And very witty, for a Disney flim), this comes across as Joel and Ethan Coen (Big Lebowski) do animation. Coen Fans, check this out. Everything about this film screams Coen, (even the one-dimentional characters). Anyone else? Check it out too. These are the days when we have good songs and sharp writing in a Disney movie, none of this Lion King tosh."
71,Robin Hood,5,15 October 2017,"Great soundtrack, animation,and voice acting, but over all, a boring movie.","I used to have a tape of this movie when I was younger, and I always remembered watching it quite a few times. When I thought back to the movie, I couldn't really recall about the movie, except the music, and a few random moments. I saw this was on Netflix, and I re-watched the movie with some friends. We all had the same reaction; the music, like most Disney films, was great, but this time, the plot was boring. The whole movie seems a bit episodic, and unfocused. I don't regret seeing it, though. This movie should be fine for kids, just something pop in, and entertain them for a while. Of you're older, I'd say 15 and older, this movie is going to be more boring than entertaining."
72,Robin Hood,10,4 October 2017,Why doesn't this get more praise?,"I really like Robin Hood. The colours, the humor, the villain, the action scenes. I just think it has everything to be good entertainment for all. It is a shame that it is rarely spoken of. I find it SO much better than the cutesy and lazy Aristocats which is really overrated. Prince John and Sir Hiss are hilarious villains throughout the movie. Basically a spoiled brat who cries loudly when things don't go his way. It is hard to make such a person credible, but Peter Ustinov does a great job. And he also sucks his thumb, genius! Actually, the Sheriff of Nottingham is a far more cruel villain in the movie.Robin Hood also has these great changes in atmosphere. From whimsical and colourful to dark and melancholic. And the soundtrack is amazing! I don't care what others say, the songs are gorgeous. When the soft and sincere ""Love"" plays I cry every time, it is so romantic. You really feel the romance. And ""Not In Nottingham"" sets the perfect mood when all citizens in Nottingham seem to have lost all hope. It also has some of the best suspense from a Disney movie and a good climax. Go watch it yourself. I will not ruin the experience."
73,Robin Hood,7,6 September 2017,Done to Death,"There have been so many treatments of the Robin Hood legend. In this animated one, we are serenaded by the wonderful Roger Miller (who died way too soon). He plays a singing rooster. The plot is the old Sheriff of Nottingham going after the poacher and thief, Robin Hood. Robin wins the big archery tournament and hooks up with Maid Marion (they are both foxes or there would be some issues here). Of course, Prince John and the Sheriff will stop at nothing to get their man and use the threatened hanging of Friar Tuck to draw our amazing archer into the open. There's no question how this ends. The animation is truly striking and it's a nice story. You will recognize some of the voices though we must go back some time."
74,Robin Hood,9,22 July 2017,Just like I remember when I first watched as a kid.,"I agree with another user that said it's one of the most underrated Disney movies. It's been now redone for a Blu-ray re-release. After watching it again, out came my childhood memories, it's a masterpiece, really.The audio could have gotten a full remaster, it still sounds muffled. The picture is very crisp and now shows some edges of the drawings themselves.It's been a long time since I last watched it and I'm very glad I could watch it again, and treasure this forever. Thanks for the memories Disney!"
75,Robin Hood,6,28 May 2017,Much better than expected,"ROBIN HOOD is a Disneyfied version of the popular folk legend, positing the various familiar characters as various animals. Thus Robin himself is a charming fox, and one of the villains is a lisping snake played by the great Terry-Thomas. Overall I found this to be a much better production than expected given its reputation; the music is toe-tappingly good and the voice actors work hard to add emotion and meaning to their voices. There's little to complain about regarding the old-fashioned animation, which has real character. Peter Ustinov is a particularly oily delight as the villain of the piece. The plot moves along at a fair old whack and it's all very light-hearted and comedic without being silly or juvenile. In fact, it might just be one of the most entertaining Robin Hood films to come out of Hollywood."
76,Robin Hood,7,30 April 2017,Not for children only,"I rent this movie for my children in 1993 and end up with them watching this cartoon for first time,once more now on DVD l revisited this Disney's version of tale of Robin Hood this plot is the same but oriented by children's taste bringing a good thief who steal of the rich to give to the poor...and the love with lady Marian and help the people against the phony King John...marvelously conceived by Disney this amazing cartoon not for children only!!!"
77,Robin Hood,10,26 April 2017,One of childhood favorites!!,"Disney's Robin Hood (1973) is often overlooked and has been very underrated over the years. I couldn't ever imagine why in the world it would be though! It's so good! It has great animation just like all Disney classics and it also has very well written and colorful characters. The characters are just effortless to love, it's nearly impossible not to fall in love with them. Many are amusing and will make you laugh, then they'll tug at your heart just like only Disney can do. There's great friendship and romance shared between characters in the movie. The plot is simple and everyone knows what the tale of Robin Hood is all about. Take from the rich and give to the poor kind of thing. The plot is so well executed. The filmmakers do it with charm, wit, and a good bit of humor. The perfect combination for children! This again is a great choice to have for family movie night! It will entertain both the young and old, it's universal as far as age and gender goes in its ability to please an audience. I love the songs, they're fun and catchy. The villain is good too, we have a very silly villain here, not too seriously evil when compared to say the evil queen, and that works for this movie. All in all Disney knocks it out of the park once again. 10/10!"
78,Robin Hood,7,17 March 2017,Generally Enjoyable Disney Animated Feature with An Disappointing Music Soundtrack,"The legend of Robin Hood's exploits may have occurred in the 13th century (i.e. 1200's) and the earliest known written account is from the 14th century via ""Piers Ploughman"" by William Langland. So essentially it is a very medieval story/legend. Disney's animated take on the legend is a fairly enjoyable family experience. It does have one glaring shortcoming which I'll relate later in my review.In typical Disney fashion, the characters are all anthropomorphized animals, i.e. animals which are human-like. Robin Hood is a fox, Little John is a bear, Friar Tuck is a badger, Maid Marion is a vixen, King John is a lion, etc. The story is told by Alan-a-Dale a rooster-minstrel play by Phil Harris. The characters are generally true to those of the original legend, and to give it credit. The friendship between Robin and Little John is legendary and of course the love affair between him and Maid Marion. Friar Tuck provides the voice of morality to the story, very similar to Friar Laurence of ""Romeo and Juliet"". And it does include the famous archery contest which is missing in many screen renditions of the story. Although most kids have heard of Robin Hood, American kids generally don't know when the Middle Ages occurred let alone it's cultural heritage. When I saw this film, I knew of Robin Hood but I don't believe I quite understand that the story was supposed to take place in the 1200's.While I can buy into the anthropomorphized take on the characters, ""Disney's Robin Hood"" is weak in one glaring respect. The filmmakers opted for songs by American songwriters, particularly Phil Harris and Roger Miller, known for country-western pop tunes such as ""King of the Road"". When I saw this Disney's offering of the medieval legend as a kid, I didn't know anything about medieval secular music. Not until I was in college I found out there are quite a number of secular tunes which survive from the late Middle Ages. I think Disney missed out on a golden opportunity to use medieval music rather than late 20th century country-style tunes. Phil Harris tells the story in a gruff American country voice with an acoustic guitar. The guitar wouldn't be invented for another 500 years from around the time of the events. In other words, medieval minstrels wouldn't use guitars. So sadly, the music style fails to bring us into the 13th century. (Roger Miller would a decade later write the score for a Broadway production of ""Huckleberry Finn"" called ""Big River"" which was a much more appropriate use of his talents. He would win awards for the music.) Still, all things considered, Disney's ""Robin Hood"" stays truer to the story than many other offerings. The later ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" is not as well written as the Disney animated film, in particular they cut out the archery contest. The best in recent years is probably ""Robin Hood"" starring Russell Crowe and directed by Ridley Scott. However, even that offering is only about half the story as he doesn't become ""Robin Hood"" until the very end."
79,Robin Hood,8,12 March 2017,"A Good Effort During The ""Down Years"" Of Disney","Sandwiched in between the death of Walt Disney, the visionary who established the entire Disney brand, and the company's partnership with Pixar that produced Toy Story, was a period of time in which Disney Co. was in limbo. This film came along smack dab during that period, but still managed to turn in a more than decent effort.The basic plot of Disney's Robin Hood closely follows the classic tale, where Robin (with the help of Little John and Friar Tuck) tries to save the poor citizens of Nottingham from a corrupt Sheriff and King, all the while striving for the hand of that beautiful Maid Marion. The fantastical twist, however, sees the characters being portrayed in an animal form that children will love. Robin is a crafty fox, Marion is his lovely vixen, King John is a cowardly lion, and the evil Sheriff is a menacing wolf, to name but a few.The plot of the film pretty much meanders around aimlessly, but is filled with enough action, hijinks, and subtle dashes of humor to keep your interest. In a nice addition, a slew of child-like characters add some heart to the movie, as well as give the kiddies some contemporaries to identify with (I did while watching the film as a youngster!).Perhaps the hallmark of the entire effort, though, is the fantastic music. The soothing, clear vocals of Roger Miller narrate portions of the film, as well as provide the signature songs. Other characters also lend their vocal talents to the soundtrack, and none fail.Thus, although Robin Hood isn't as ""classic"" as the early Disney collection or as ultimately engaging as the films of the Pixar era, children (and nostalgic adults) can still find plenty of things to enjoy about this movie. Plus, with Russell Crowe set to resurrect the Robin Hood franchise in a feature film this summer, now is the time to re-discover this hidden gem."
80,Robin Hood,7,3 July 2016,Walt Disney Productions' Robin Hood was one of the pretty entertaining animated efforts made after the founder's passing,"After years of only watching bits and pieces of this movie, I finally watched the entirety of this on a recent flight from Korean Air. Made after Walt Disney's death, it still had many of his old crew involved making this quite entertainingly funny to watch. All the characters of the Robin Hood tale are portrayed as various forest animals with the leading character and his leading lady being foxes. This marked Phil Harris' third and final voice role in a Disney movie, having previously been such in The Jungle Book (Uncle Walt's last in the animated category) and The AristoCats. Roger Miller contributed some songs and also voiced a character though the tune that got an Oscar nomination-""Love""-was written and performed by someone else. Overall, Robin Hood was a nice movie to watch on a flight back home..."
81,Robin Hood,9,27 June 2016,The Foxy Version of Robin Hood,"""Robin Hood""I love the old animated Disney films. Even the lesser known or poorer ones such as ""Oliver and Company"" or ""Aristocats"". The charm to Robin Hood is his persona and his relationships off of the other characters. His rapport with Little John is heart-warming and I do like the sense of camaraderie between them. His love/romance with Maid Marian is sweet, though I do wish that more time was devoted to it. In fact, Maid Marian vanishes in the third act of the film and only appears at the end of the films during their marriage. Where did she go? Was she just sitting in the forest and waiting for the action to pass her by? She displays some ferocity and bravery when she throws a pie in a guard's face during the action sequence in the middle of the film (Which is a hilarious and greatly done set piece). I am a sucker for romance and I do love the chemistry that the two foxes share, it's something that you can all sit down and enjoy. The supporting characters are enjoyably fun and memorable. The one thing that old Disney films (and some newer ones) can do so well is the side characters. You remember them all and you love seeing them get their way. King John and Hiss are OTT and it sounds like the actors are having an absolute ball with their roles. I can't say I didn't like them, as even if they're are evil, they provide some hysterical lines. The kids didn't annoy me here, as I thought they would. They're adorable and I did like their enthusiasm of following after Robin Hood. The action is great and the final climax is bundles of fun. I would say more, but the charming main character, the adorable romance and the fun side-characters provide a good 80 minutes of fun filled fluff."
82,Robin Hood,5,29 February 2016,Robin Hood: The film that birthed many a fur,"When I was young, I loved watching Disney films with my family. From Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs to Brother Bear, I loved every film. So, with Robin Hood being one of their classics, you'd think I'd like it too! Unfortunately, even when I was young, I never cared much for this film...but I couldn't stop watching it either. Why is that? Was it the animation? The characters? The story? The anthro characters?Let's talk about the story. If you know the legend of Robin Hood, then this movie is nothing new. It's basically Robin Hood and his buddy Little John robbing the rich and giving to the poor. It's a classic Robin Hood story that's been told many of times, but Disney does manage to find a way to make it creative, which is the use of anthropomorphic characters. Sadly, the story does fall apart near the middle once half of the villagers are jailed, cause by then it seems like the story is on fast-forward as it races towards a, surprisingly, tense action- packed finale. The ending also suffers from being classic Disney fare, UNLESS you look at the alternate ending, which actually ends the story a bit better and a better explanation pertaining to Prince John's punishment.Thankfully, the characters save this movie from being almost boring. First, you got the main man himself, Robin Hood. Portrayed as a fox, he is the prince of thieves, but not your standard thief. Instead of going for the poor, he goes for the rich to give to the poor. His design is decent for the time, though he suffers from the 'Disney Big Eye Syndrome' at times, especially when the film focuses on his face straight-on. There's also his friend and cohort, Little John, whom I'm just gonna say this, is a straight copy of Baloo from The Jungle Book in terms of both design and characteristics. Yes, I know this film does copy from the aforementioned Jungle Book and I will touch on it in a bit, but if you want to know what Little John is like, watch Baloo in that film and you'll see tons of similarities. Moving on, we got Maid Marian, who is sadly very under-used. Unlike other adaptations of the tale, here she is literally only in three scenes: The beginning where she is playing bad-mitten and kisses one of the rabbit kids, the archery scene and finally the ending. You'd think she would have a good amount of screen time, but she ends up being wasted in her role (Though, I'll give the film this: Her design does make her cute). As for the villains, they are some of the funniest villains Disney had made in a while. I like how Prince John, while ruthless, is more or less reduced to a momma's boy and when stuff doesn't go to plan, ends up sucking his thumb. His assistant Sir Hiss, though, ends up being much like Maid Marian as in being wasted potential. As for the Sheriff Of Nottingham, well, dude's a douche. I was tempted to peg him as the worst character but he is saved by one thing: His voice actor. Voiced by the late Pat Buttram, he manages to bring a bit of goofiness to the character and, at times, a bit of Mister Haney in there as well. With the rest of the characters, they're just there and somewhat forgettable, with a few having some cool moments, so there is not much to say.Like all of Disney's classic animated films, the animation here is beautiful at times. The backgrounds are a treat to look at and the characters are animated realistically but keeping their animal traits in the movement as well. But, there is a problem with the animation. The problem being is that it, well, is infamously known for copying a lot of sequences and animation cells from the previously released films 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs', 'The Aristocats', and 'The Jungle Book', with the most infamous scene in the film being the Dance Scene near the middle of the film. Not only are moves reused from the previous aforementioned films, but it is a shot-for-shot remake of all the dance scenes from those films. Sure, you can attribute this to a smaller budget, but they could've at least made some newer dance animation cells for this film instead of reusing so many from those films.Now let us return to a question I asked earlier: Why did I return to watch this film so many times even though I never cared for the film? Well, it wasn't because of the anthro characters, the story, nor the animation. It was because it was a Disney film that, to me, didn't feel like the usual Disney fare. Unlike their previous films, this one felt more like a live-action film then a animated film, if that makes sense. I think that's why I returned to watch it constantly. It felt like a mature Disney film then what they were known for back in the day.In conclusion, Robin Hood, while it has it faults, ranks up there as one of Disney classic animated films, I still do recommend this film to any Disney fan out there."
83,Robin Hood,8,29 July 2015,Sly as a fox,"Robin Hood is a heroic outlaw in English folklore who, according to legend, was a highly skilled archer and swordsman. Traditionally depicted as being dressed in Lincoln green,[1] he is often portrayed as ""robbing from the rich and giving to the poor"" alongside his band of Merry Men. Robin Hood became a popular folk figure in the late-medieval period, and continues to be widely represented in literature, films and television.It was a really nice Disney movie with interesting characters and some enjoyable scenes. People can perceptive differents recurring scenes, things, symbols, which have been in Snow white and the seven dwarfs,The ArostiCats, and the The Jungle Book. So this movie includes some characteristics of Disney, and it was mixed scenes of the mentioned films."
84,Robin Hood,10,15 July 2015,Childhood favourite,"Even after all these years, this film is still in my top 5. Excellent songs, excellent plot, excellent ending! When I was little I wore out my VHS copy of this to near death, but I still have it today. The story of Robin Hood has been told time and time again, in live action, theatre, and animation. In my opinion this classic telling of the story is the best by far. There is just something so charming about depicting the characters as animals that makes them more friendly, lovable, and great story tellers themselves. This story always struck me as having that fairytale element and I feel that something like that could never be done justice in live action. Overall it is a story best told by foxes."
85,Robin Hood,7,10 April 2015,Sweet little Disney children's classic,"Sweet little Disney children's classic.Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who also directed The Jungle Book, 101 Dalmatians and The Aristocats, Robin Hood is one of the quintessential children's movies. Has a sweet, often funny story, with the characters portrayed by animals. Adults however, may find the plot a bit basic. Still good fun though.Where Robin Hood doesn't reach the same level of class as The Jungle Book, however, is in the music. Every song on The Jungle Book was catchy and incredibly memorable. Robin Hood's music just isn't in the same league, and feels flat and insignificant. This, despite enlisting the musical talents of Roger Miller for a few of the songs.Overall, worth the watch, no matter what your age."
86,Robin Hood,6,14 March 2015,Good Fun,"The story of the legendary outlaw is portrayed with the characters as humanoid animals.This is a story well known but a film probably not often watched. Ranking the Disney cartoons best to worst, this would be lucky to end up somewhere in the middle. Not that it is all bad, but it has been overshadowed by its successors. We still get Phil Harris, Terry-Thomas and some fun characters. Not to mention the song that would inspire ""The Hamster Dance"" decades later.Those from Wisconsin will be a bit surprised and excited to hear the tune of ""On Wisconsin"" during a football scene. Was someone in the music department a University of Madison graduate?"
87,Robin Hood,7,15 February 2015,Disney Animation Lives On,"Many people of my generation (those who grew up in the late 80s and early 90s) light up with enthusiasm whenever Robin Hood is mentioned in a conversation about Disney films. Yet Robin Hood isn't generally regarded as one of the greats. It is a film I enjoy very much, but it has it's ups and downs with me. Robin Hood was the first Disney feature to go into production after Walt Disney's death. This was a time when the future of Disney animation was still very much in doubt, since many didn't think that the studio could go on without Walt. With Robin Hood the studio went back to its roots to the days of the Silly Symphonies. They decided to use all anthromorphic animals for the roles and type cast by animal. That for me was the appeal to the film. Prince John is one of my favorite villains. He's a lot like Captain Hook in that he's very immature and is constantly undermined. The Sheriff of Nottingham is one of the funnier yet most detestable villains. I like how they portray the love between Robin Hood and Maid Marian. The film also has egregious reuse of animation from previous films, but this was because the studio was in survival mode. The second half of the film wasn't as engaging as the first half. Maid Marian disappears until the end. The climax would have been stronger if they showed her in some sort of peril where Robin Hood would rescue her. The film probably had great appeal to children because there aren't any scary scenes like in the earlier films. While not as strong as the Disney films of the 60s, Robin Hood proved that Disney animation could go on without Walt."
88,Robin Hood,,12 August 2014,"""Oh, he's so handsome. Just like his reward posters.""","Charming Disney version of the Robin Hood tale. With animals in place of humans, of course. The voice work is great. The animation is modest but nice. The music is quite fun. I liked all of the songs, particularly the folksy country ones. It moves along at a leisurely pace. Probably better suited for teens and adults than little kids. This one doesn't have the strongest reputation. I can't help but feel it's a little under-appreciated. I watched this movie quite a bit growing up. I realize it may seem a little flat to kids who grew up in the Pixar era, but I hope they can appreciate these older Disney cartoons. They may not be as flashy as today's animated movies but they are still very entertaining, quality productions."
89,Robin Hood,8,16 December 2010,"great film, but might not be for everyone","Robin Hood (1973) A classic cartoon made from a classic story.Robin Hood is a little slower than cartoons now days but it's still very entertaining. It's, in my opinion, one of the most memorable Disney films of all time.It's a little different than most versions of Robin Hood but I think it had to be since it's Disney. The main story is still there and it's great, although I think the main reason its child friendly and liked is because all the characters are animals. Unlike Oliver and Company where the story of Oliver Twist is changed to be about cats, Robin Hood is played by animals and could have been people, which I think makes it less appealing in some aspects.The fox Robin Hood was one of my favorite characters growing up. I also still think that Prince John and Sir Hiss are hilarious. One of my other favorite parts of the film is the narrating and soundtrack of Roger Miller. It is definitely a cartoon you watch for the story more than the comedy, like Snow White or Cinderella.The film however does move a little slow at times. I think most cartoons now are much more active and funny than they used to so I feel some kids now days won't be as into it as kids were in the 70s and 80s. This Robin Hood is still a great version; I just feel it might be appreciated more by a slightly older audience than most cartoons.8/10"
90,Robin Hood,,3 February 2009,Prince John's Song,"The song about Prince John is a cleaned up version of an old English Drinking song called ""The Bastard King of England"".""Oh the English Sing Of and English King Of Many Long Years Ago. Who Ruled his Land With and Iron Hand Tho' his morals were Weak and Low. His Only Outer Garment Was a Dirty Yellow Shirt. With which he tried to hide his hide but he couldn't hide the Dirt. He was Dirty and Lousy and Full of Fleas. But he had his Women by Twos and Threes. God bless The Bastard King Of Eng-a-laaand.""The following verses are too raunchy to print here.Look for Info on an Oscar Brand for more bawdy songs."
91,Robin Hood,6,19 September 2005,Robin Hood,"Before I heard of the Kevin Costner and Errol Flynn versions of the classic legend story of the man who stole from the rich and gave to the poor, there was this cartoon version by Walt Disney Pictures, with the interesting idea of animals playing the characters. I obviously liked it when I was a kid, but I saw it not too long ago, and it is just a bit corny and more aimed at kids. Anyway, it brings back singer Phil Harris from The Aristocats and The Jungle Book, as Little John. It also introduces Brian Bedford as Robin Hood. There are some good moments of cartoon like comedy, but again, more for kids. Also starring Peter Ustinov as Prince John and tom thumb's Terry-Thomas as Sir Hiss. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Love"". Good!"
92,Robin Hood,6,19 March 2006,a classic Disney film,"'Robin Hood' was one of my favourite Disney animations when I was younger. This animation included a cast of animals playing the characters in the tale. Robin Hood is a fox, and Little John is a bear. A group of these animals team up to steal from the rich and give to the poor.This was a fun animation with plenty of humor, action, and adventure. I am not sure what I would think of this film now, through an adult's eyes, but I absolutely loved it. No, this animation cannot be compared to some of Disney's other films, but this does nothing to hurt the film. It is still a fun film and worth a watch. I think it is also a film that children can appreciate even today. This is also my favourite film version of Robin Hood's tale."
93,Robin Hood,6,19 March 2003,A witty Disney tale!,"I used to always watch this one when I was younger.  It was one of my favorites, and like all little children, I'd watch it at least once a day. I watched it again today, if only to revive old memories.Somehow, it's not as good as I remember.  Perhaps I was drawn to the bright colors and the funny characters.  Whatever it was, it seemed to be missing today.But still, it's a nice tale of semi-good versus good.  Robin Hood is now characterized as a charming young Fox.  Little John is a bear (who seems much like Baloo) and Friar Tuck is... uh... a Friar.  Not too sure what he is.  Maybe a mole.Anyway, it's a funny movie with some nice songs and good action.  It probably has one of the best villains in Disney history.  Come on, how many times do you see a guy scream, ""Kill him!"" in a Disney movie?  Not that often.  King Richard and Sir Hiss will have you laughing throughout the movie.However, there are only two climactic moments in the movie, and this makes it out to be just a little tedious.  That doesn't deter from the nature of the film, though, and it's an exciting romp nonetheless.  Although it's more for the children, I'm sure it can appeal to viewers of many ages."
94,Robin Hood,8,23 November 2006,"it's less than great, but I liked watching it as a kid","I wouldn't recommend the Disney animated 70s movie of Robin Hood as essential Disney, but I have some great memories of it as a kid anyway. If there's any one thing I could probably criticize it's the song numbers- they just don't work and lack the fine polish of the Sherman brothers collaborations. Looking back on it it's very dated in that respect, sort of serving to the kids of the moment in part, and even to the point of reusing actual dancing bits from the Jungle Book (if you've seen these movies as much as I have you start to notice these things). And as far as energy goes it's sometimes pretty lackadaisical. This being said, I also found a lot of it to be very funny, with the interplay between Peter Ustinov and Terry Thomas is fantastically good- they're such laughable villains, yet when they do strike their irons down it goes pretty dangerously. Of course you wont find anything at all in way of getting at all into the character underneath their basic demeanors- Robin Hood and those on his side, good, Prince John and those on his side, bad. But within those boundaries there is entertaining stuff going around, with the first robbing of Prince John through the very cheap disguise Robin puts on one, and another when Little John disguises himself as a Duke. Again, nothing immediately noteworthy, but as a kid I found a lot to go on it, with the more cartoonish aspects of the villains and side character outweighing the weaker sections of music and song, stale Robin and Mariam parts, and so on."
95,Robin Hood,5,27 November 2006,"Still, I prefer Errol Flynn and Cary Elwes.","When I was young, my favorite scene in Disney's version of ""Robin Hood"" was always the battle following archery tournament (you gotta admit, it would be cool to experience that). Otherwise, it seems like the whole thing is sort of a Disney movie: a classic story turned into a jolly musical, with some comic relief here and there.So, it's not a terrible movie. I just prefer the Errol Flynn version, and Mel Brooks's spoof of the Kevin Costner version (plus the short cartoons starring Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck). OK for some brief entertainment.So yes, let's point that pea-shooter the other way."
96,Robin Hood,4,26 May 2013,2nd of the 8 in the Dark Era,"This was first film that was completely done after Walt Disney's death (it was approved, produced, and released after his death, unlike his predecessors). While this film was a modest success, at this point it was clear that animated films were not the company's strong point.This film practically your typical Robin Hood story, with Anamorphic animals. Robin Hood and Little John rob for the poor and from the rich. Robin Hood and Maid Marian are in love with each other. The ruler taxed his people to the point that they are in poverty. Will Robin Hood get caught robbing?The characters in this movie are bey black and white. Robin Hood is the generic hero, Maid Marian is the generic maiden, Little John is the generic goofy best friend. The tiger ruler (forgot his name) is the most interesting character in the film, as he is a whiny, lazy brat, but also extremely threatening. All the other side characters are not that memorable.The songs in this movie are....decent? Thy are not memorable, except for the love song ""Love"" which is a good love song. The rest sound like a bunch of random noise that is trying to mix British and Country music.The animation is not good at all. The Xerography is not used well at all, and this movie has the most borrowed animation (tracing back to Cinderella and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad). The entire dance scene is borrowed from films like The Aristocats, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and The Jungle Book. The film is just not appealing to the eye.To put it bluntly, this film is a mess. Bad animation and soundtrack, generic characters, and a good plot that is not executed well. There are some filler scenes that just drag on and on. What does somewhat save this film is the fun and charm that it has, and even that could not save the film. The company's magic continued to diminish with this movie."
97,Robin Hood,5,31 July 2015,Often feels like an afterthought,"Robin Hood rarely features on many people's favourite Disney movies, and there's a good reason why. Disney's original concept was an adaptation of Reynard the Fox, a collection of allegorical fables from Europe. The deceptive fox was seen as an amoral leading figure for their squeaky-clean and child-friendly output, so the plan was abolished in favour of adapting a more familiar folk-tale, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. This sudden change of plan causes Robin Hood to feel almost like an afterthought, written in such a hurry that the plot seems to shift around without focus, and characters feel like abandoned first draft's of the classic Disney heroes and villains.With King Richard away fighting his crusade, the kingdom is left in the hands of his thumb-sucking, mommy's-boy younger brother Prince John (Peter Ustinov). Our narrator Allan-a-Dale (Roger Miller) informs us that the poor are being bled dry by the astronomical taxes set by the Sheriff of Nottingham (Pat Buttram), and rely on the exploits of local hero Robin Hood (Brian Bedford) and his companion Little John (Phil Harris), who routinely steal from the rich to give to the poor. Robin enters into an archery tournament dressed as a stork in the hope of winning the heart of old flame Maid Marian (Monica Evans), under the watchful eye of Prince John and his hypnotic sidekick Sir Hiss (Terry-Thomas), who want Robin's head.Despite the mediocrity of the final film, Robin Hood is certainly bolstered by the impressive array of vocal talent. Bedford provides the charming twang of an English gent and Terry-Thomas is suitably and simultaneously reptilian and hilarious, but Peter Ustinov walks away with the film - his whiny rich-boy Prince John is one the greatest characters Disney have ever created. The presence of such quality British talent makes it strange that a lot of the cast sound like cowboys who have somehow wandered into a distinctly English setting. Some sequences are recycled directly from Disney classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and The Jungle Book (1967), and some characters are even borrowed and simply re-named. It's an up-and- down experience, where the plot occasionally wanders and lingers without any sense of narrative, but when Bedford, Thomas and Ustinov share a scene, that familiar Disney magic re-emerges."
98,Robin Hood,,4 May 2014,Another Winner from Disney,"Robin Hood (1973)*** (out of 4)Disney's take on the classic tale isn't really considered one of their best but there's certainly a lot of very good things going for it. For starters, all of the familiar characters are perfectly brought to the animated screen and this includes Robin Hood, Prince John, Maid Marian, Little John and the Sheriff of Nottingham. I really thought all of the characters were perfectly done and the voice talents behind them really bring them to life. Robin Hood and Little John just have a wonderful comic timing together and there's no doubt that the romance between Robin and Marian feels real. Another good thing is the actual adventure that Robin goes through with his followers as they attack the villains. The ending contains a lot of fun as the good guys try to escape their jails and head for freedom. Yet, more entertaining stuff comes from the Roger Miller rooster character popping in with the musical numbers. The numbers certainly aren't the most memorable from Disney but they're entertaining enough. I think the biggest fault with the film is that there's no more laughs. Yes, there's some very funny stuff here from time to time but just not enough to where the film is a bigger entertainment. Still, there's no question that there's still plenty of magic here and it's another winner from the studio."
99,Robin Hood,8,30 December 2013,A fun-filled entertaining family film in it's 30th Anniversary!,"After Walt Disney died in 1966 right before The Jungle Book was released, they other workers decided to continue making more films without him in honor of his memory. Later, in 1973, after The Aristocats received lukewarm reviews from critics, but found it's audience in 1970, they made an adaptation of a legendary hero who robs the rich and give to the poor known as ""Robin Hood"".It tells the story about the title character and others in an anthropomorphism way about Robin Hood and his friend Little John as they attempt to bring the money back to the poor, but they must also bring peace to Nottingham from the evil tyrant Prince John.Seeing this as a child, is it still a classic that holds up to this day in it's 30th Anniversary? Not exactly, but with all due respect, this is a very entertaining Disney family movie for kids and adults to enjoy. The animation, aside from some recycled bits from Snow White, Jungle Book, & Aristocats in the ""Phony King of England"" sequence, is very lovely with beautiful backgrounds and solid character animation.The characters are likable and are helped by a solid voice cast. Brian Bedford as Robin Hood is charming enough and his line-delivery is solid! Phil Harris, the guy who voiced Baloo in The Jungle Book and Thomas O Malley is The Aristocats, is both funny and serious as Little John. Monica Evans is very lovely as Maid Marian and Peter Ustinov did a solid work as the hilarious villain Prince John. The other characters are great and so are the sidekicks especially Pat Buttram as the Sheriff of Nottingham.The music score is nice and while the songs may not be as memorable as the other Disney films, particularly Beauty and the Beast & The Lion King, but they're pleasant enough to listen to. The dialog is hilarious and smart it makes up for the overall episodic plot. There are a lot of great moments including the fight scene after the archery contest and the climax.Overall, Disney's Robin Hood may not match the same depth as the more superior films, but it's still a fun-filled entertaining family film that everyone will watch again and again for all time. Recommended! :)"
100,Robin Hood,,18 October 2013,little more than a classic,"a fable. first meeting with a legendary hero. touching music. and inspired humor. a pure Disney who teach about basic values in a delicious manner. the voice of Peter Ustinov is one of most powerful memories from last part of my childhood. but, after many years, I rediscover it and the seduction - far to common magic of old fashion animation was rebirth.because , more than an amusing classic, it is a smart film. for the story itself and for the science to make the best portrait of Robin Hood before the contact with history books. for the thin slice of romance and for the unique scene of engagement. for joy and for the option for poor fox to be one of most famous couples of all periods. little more than a classic. or a classic with a huge heart."
101,Robin Hood,8,14 August 2013,Everything we've come to expect from a Disney movie,"""Robin Hood"" 40th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Brings the Classic Home in Hi-Def Robin Hood (a fox) and his merry band of animals steal from the rich and give to the poor. It just so happens that most of the riches come from the greedy paws of Prince John (a lion). He constantly has his henchman, the Sheriff of Nottingham (a wolf), collect taxes from the poor animals of Sherwood Forest to line his own pockets. Even though Robin is wanted by Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham, he risks his life to enter an archery contest and win the hand of Maid Marion (a vixen).This classic has everything we've come to expect from a Disney movie. Basically, it's filled with talking animals in the roles of characters dancing and singing merrily. I'm not a huge fan of musicals, but the story in between more than makes up for the moments I sit waiting for the crooning to end.Much like ""The Aristocats"" was a product of its jazz and big-band cultural surroundings in 1970, ""Robin Hood"" features a soundtrack influenced by the folk artists of that same period. It fits the atmosphere of the movie perfectly. There's no doubt children and fans of Gordon Lightfoot, Peter, Paul and Mary, and other singer-songwriters will be delighted."
102,Robin Hood,6,29 July 2013,Disney's charming take on the legend is an overlooked treasure,"For most kids these days, their introduction to Robin Hood is through this Disney animated classic. All subsequent Robin Hood movies are measured against this one, and no number of misguided revisions of the legend can diminish the charm of this cartoon.""Robin Hood"" was released in an overlooked period of Disney animation, long after ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Dumbo,"" and long before ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Lion King."" ""Robin Hood"" doesn't really live up to the earlier classics, nor is it as good as the more recent films. But as a minor Disney classic, it is still a charming movie.Allan-a-Dale, a lute-strumming rooster, informs us that this is the legend as it is told in the Animal Kingdom, which is basically the same as the Human Kingdom's version, except with animals. It contains familiar Robin Hood legends, such as the archery tournament, although sometimes with a twist. For example, Robin Hood must rescue Friar Tuck from hanging rather than Will Stutely.True to other Disney cartoons, the songs and animation are cute. You will have a hard time resisting the urge to smile hearing the opening song. Oscar winner Peter Ustinov (Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus"") is especially good as the voice of Prince John.However, while the film is relatively short (83 minutes), the story seems to drag after the one-hour mark because the movie doesn't follow the typical rhythm that has been culturally ingrained in our minds. After the archery tournament and ensuring madcap action sequence one hour into the movie, most of the conflicts up to that point have been resolved. The film comes up with a second conflict for the last 20-some minutes. The short movie had a hard time retaining my attention during the final act.The movie also had some historical inaccuracies that were laughable for anyone familiar with medieval English history. In one song bashing Prince John, they said that he will not be remembered for the laws he passed, but rather for being the phony king of England. John is remembered today for passing (under duress) the Magna Carta, an early forerunner to the Constitution. Prince John is cursed throughout the film for imposing crushing taxes, considered by all to be unjust since only the true king, Richard the Lionheart (literally a lion in the cartoon), has the right to tax the people. The film conveniently fails to mention that Prince John had to raise taxes to pay for King Richard's crusade. King Richard eventually returns and arrests Prince John, so he can never harm the English people again. An epilogue pointing out that John would reign as the king of England for 17 years after Richard would have been warranted.But expecting historical accuracy from a Disney film is like expecting gourmet food from McDonald's, so that isn't a major criticism. (One joke I heard around the time James Cameron's ""Titanic"" was released was that if Disney had made ""Titanic,"" not only would Leonardo DiCaprio have lived, but he would have prevented the ship from sinking.)""Robin Hood"" is nevertheless a satisfying introduction to the culturally significant legend that will appeal to Disney's intended audience."
103,Robin Hood,8,26 February 2009,Truly entertaining!,"Robin Hood mayn't have the direct charm or the memorable songs of the later Disney movies, but it is solid entertainment nonetheless. The animation is generally lovely, if slightly archaic which is a style I kind of like, but the story sometimes fails to engage being fairly episodic but this is only occasionally. But the action highlight was the archery contest, which was so funny, as was the witty and delightful script. The songs are not as memorable as the ones in Beauty and the Beast, but they are still lovely. ""Love"" is a beautiful song, but my favourite was ""Phony King of England"" because of the funny lyrics. The only song I didn't like as such was the rather annoying song in the opening credits, which were a bit long. As for the characters, I loved the fact, the animators made the legendary characters animals. The best ones were Prince John and Sir Hiss, who were an absolutely hilarious double act, especially when Prince John sucks his thumb, the only villain to do that. Peter Ustinov and Terry Thomas were superb supplying the voice overs. Robin and Little John were also entertaining, as well as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Casting Phil Harris as Little John was genius, after his incredible voice-over as Baloo in the Jungle Book. I particularly loved the line ""I'm Sir Reginald, duke of Chutney"". I know in some scenes, they looked as though they were running out of ideas, but they weren't. They were just looking for a bit of inspiration. In conclusion, a really entertaining animation, that couldn't really live up to the Jungle Book. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
104,Robin Hood,10,4 January 2009,Disney's very finest offering and one of the best movies of all-time,"Just saw this movie for the first time this year and rewatched it the other day. The first time I saw it, I thought it was utterly brilliant. The second time? Utterly brilliant. One of the few films that remains just as excellent on rewatch and possibly even gets better.I'm shocked and disconcerted to hear it's considered by some to be one of the worst classic Disney films. If this movie is an really an example of Disney when it's being half-assed, then I wish it would half-ass its movies more often, because the result of their supposed insouciance is a wonderful, delightful, and perfect movie, an extremely charming, fun, and well-written interpretation of ""Robin Hood"".I think one thing that seems to throw some people off about it is that it's not like any Disney movie that came before it. To me, that's part of what makes it so fantastic. Many of the jokes and scenes are ones I wouldn't expect to see from a Disney movie, and it seemed like this was the first Disney movie that wasn't afraid of taking a few risks with its characters, jokes, tone, structure, et cetera. And the risks they took with comedy stand the test of time; the jokes in this movie are not dated or forced in the slightest.The lack of an overarching plot was another thing I love about the movie. It all flowed very well and sucked me into the world of Nottingham, as the narrative depicted a time period in the lives of the denizens. Instead of offering a formulaic, beginning-middle-end type of plot, it offered several episodes of different events in Nottingham, each intriguing and engaging.These episodes also balanced each other out quite well in tone; we got to see both the carefree, down-to-earth moments and the darker plights of all the characters, making the whole movie feel very well-rounded and very real. It wasn't as if the movie portrayed everything in black-and-white. There were shades of happiness in the sadness, and it was great to see the characters sometimes be able to forget about their struggles for the time being and just live in the moment. The happy moments made me feel happy and free, and the sadder moments touched me. The emotion was handled in a very rare way: it was subtle and understated, executed perfectly, not overdone, not forced, and not unconvincing.While this lighthearted yet dark, exciting, and yet down-to-earth tone and the sporadic structure were two things I really love about the movie, I think its strongest point lies in its characters. They were not cookie-cut-outs of their traditional roles and were subtly multifaceted. Robin Hood himself was not exactly a perfect Prince Charming, but yet was much more charming than any of the heroes that preceded him (and most of those who were his successors). He was engaging in every scene he was featured; he was funny, compassionate and selfless, intelligent and clever, jovial and fun despite his mission of great somberness, and is easily one of the most likable and quite admirable Disney heroes.Maid Marian could have been typical in her role, but instead she still came off as quite unique, as she carried with her none of the usual melodrama and overreactions of most Disney female characters; she was instead genuinely lighthearted, caring, and kind-hearted, a perfect match for Robin Hood. Little John, while not shown as often as I'd like, served as a perfect foil for Robin Hood in the scenes he did have, was just a very entertaining character overall, and really was the one to save Robin Hood from Prince John...he was an overlooked hero, for sure, and his friendship with Robin was endearing.Of course, Prince John and Hiss were hilarious. John's combination of being utterly insane, pathetic, spoiled, and at times just plain stupid made for an extremely funny and interesting character, and Hiss was a perfect counterpart for him. All the other characters--from the family of bunnies to Lady Cluck to the singing rooster to Friar Tuck to the sheriff--each had a discriminating personality all their own and all contributed something worthwhile to the film. It was definitely an ensemble film, completed with a greatly diversified and captivating ensemble of characters that play off each other wonderfully.So, the only flaw I find in it is the one that's already been mentioned on here several times: the reused animation and choreography. That's not a major detriment at all though, and I really couldn't care less about it when the overall package of the movie was so spectacular. This movie just oozes with great spirit, camaraderie, fun, charm and delivers the very true and relevant message of the power of unity, hope, and love for one's fellow man in times of hardship. It's a pure joy to watch, my favorite Disney movie, and one of my favorite movies of all-time."
105,Robin Hood,10,23 January 2008,One of my favorite Robin Hood films,"There had been many film adaptations based on the famous tales of the English folk hero Robin Hood and his Merry Men since 1908; all of them very different too. It is difficult to choose which are my favorite Robin Hood films. But I would say I love Disney's version and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" starring Errol Flynn.You know something, Walt Disney's Robin Hood is perhaps the most famous animated version of the legend, which had the various characters depicted as anthropomorphic animal characters, including Robin Hood and Maid Marian as foxes; I love foxes. You know, this was probably the very first time that any studio would use anthropomorphic animal characters in an animated feature. I also love 3 out the songs from the film's soundtrack: ""Oo-de-lally,"" ""Love,"" and... ""The Phony King of England."" Overall, as I said I love this film and it's another Disney favorite; my dad's favorite too."
106,Robin Hood,10,18 November 2007,Oh no. He's got a dirty thumb....,"One of Disney's best and most underrated classics (virtually second to none), ""Robin Hood"" is something every family should own.Translating the characters from Howard Pyle's classic Nottingham Forest into the animal kingdom, Disney had its first true masterpiece over three decades after breaking into the full-length animated film business.""Robin Hood""'s only failing is in the song ""Love (It Seems Like Only Yesterday),"" which is a typical, nauseating Disney romantic ballad. Otherwise, it features humor, music, animation, and storytelling that can ensnare fans of any age-- and I am living proof of this.This movie truly is ""Most Wanted."" And snakes don't walk, they slither. Hmmph. So *there*."
107,Robin Hood,10,21 November 2006,Robin Hood,"Walt Disney's Robin Hood is one of the only entirely animated Disney features I've seen that I can recall. I've enjoyed all of the Disney movies that I've seen, but this would be #1 on my list. The use of animals being all of the characters is very clever, considering that very few people would watch it other than to judge whether they like it or not. If you DON'T like this movie, give it away or donate it to a homeless shelter. If you DO like it, share it with other people that you think might like it. If you like this movie but don't have a copy of it, check around for places that do. So, rent or buy your copy of 'Robin Hood' ASAP.My rating: 10 out of 10. ^_^ ^__^"
108,Robin Hood,7,6 March 2002,Ok,"This movie is very funny, due especially to Peter Ustinov, but is a huge copy of ""The Jungle Book"" (in some places the same theme is heard, and Little John's voice sounds like Baloo's, and remember they were both bears. Lack of money? Simple laziness? Maybe I'm exaggerating. Probably.It's very funny, but nothing special.    7/10"
109,Robin Hood,,3 August 2004,fantastic,"Robin Hood i think is another fantastic disney animated movie. This movie was made in 1973, i always thought that this robin hood movie was made in the early 1960's, but i've found out that i was wrong, it came out in 1973, making this as of 2004, 31 years old. Besides having Robin hood as an animated movie, there has been a series of Robin hood and other movies, but making them live as for real, Robin Hood Prince of Thieves was made in 1991, with the best, the longest running soundtrack: Bryan Adams: Everything i do (I do it for you) The song spent an unbelieveable 16 weeks in the chart in the uk, making this the most amount of weeks for a record to be spent at the top of the uk chart singles, i've never every seen anything spending that amount of weeks in my life, but in 1994, a group called wet wet wet made their amount of weeks with the song love is all around, from the movie 4 wedding and a funeral, making that spending 15 weeks at the top of the charts. If you like this robin hood movie, then i'm sure you will love the live movies, the prince of thieves and men in tights."
110,Robin Hood,,1 October 2000,Fun to watch even with its flaws. But...,"Even though it has the worst story pacing this side of Bakshi, this version of Robin Hood is enjoyable simply because of the appeal of its characters and art design. At the time of its release, it was the most successful animated film to date. It also has enjoyable songs with only one stinker (""The Phony King of England"", which is a disaster). It has been a source of inspiration for animation/cartoonist students for years and remains a big favorite with children and adults alike.Sadly, it has also become the Holy Altar worshipped at by that sick and bizarre cult known as The Furries, who have dragged its appeal into the sewer by using it as fuel for their own twisted (and even X-rated!) fantasies. It simply isn't possible to enjoy a screening of it at a convention or movie house without encountering them these days, and they ruin the experience. I went to see a special benefit screening of it recently, and THEY all showed up...they're so fanatically obssessive over this film that they make The Partridge Family Temple look normal by comparison!So, as a warning to both parents and anyone wanting to watch and simply enjoy, be sure to get your own copy so you can see it in the privacy and innocence of your own home... otherwise you'll have the film ruined forever for you by a wacked-out group of loonies."
111,Robin Hood,1,21 August 2017,The stupid cringey version of Robin Hood,"Now the plot is similar to most Robin Hood stories robin and his band steals from the rich and gives to the poor fights the Sheriff of Nottingham and King John but with anthropomorphic animals. However this films seems to begin in the middle of the story after Robin has lost lordship and been branded a traitor to the crown and an outlaw however none of that is ever mentioned in this film as it is lazy in its storytelling and would rather begin in the middle than at the beginning like most well-structured stories. Now this version of Robin is a fox and tries to be suave and witty like Errol Flynn but comes off as an annoying idiot with a cockney accent. This version of Maid Marian is bland and boring who loves Robin however it is never shown as to why she loves him only hinted at because the writers are lazy, also make sure not to google her with safe search off otherwise you'll need a lot of bleach. Little John is basically Baloo from the jungle book and recycles some of his animations from the jungle book as well as the same voice actor. There also a King John who is a lion, but he and his followers are overly incompetent to the point of nearing mental retardation King John is also shown to be a total coward and the only reason he is unable to outwit Robin is because of his sheer incompetence.The film starts off with a stupid chicken narrating the tale of Robin Hood and says this is the real version of Robin Hood and the cringe overflows from there. After an annoying song and dance Robin and Little John walk through the forest while a song is playing about them being in the forest (redundant I know). Then the Sheriff of Nottingham and his men ambush the pair of imbeciles but being incompetent oafs they lose sight of him and easily give up their hunt further illustrating their stupidity. They then dress up as gypsies and do what gypsies do steal and though they say they are not robbers their eyes seem to gleam greedily when they spy the kings hoard of gold and proceed to steal it from him while he and his men just sit there like rocks completely unaware they being robbed even though little john clearly just fill his pockets with gold in broad daylight no one notices and they leave with their pockets full and their enemies stumped. What further illustrates that this version of robin is greedy and vain is when he only gives a small bag of gold to a poor family and is never seen giving more than that meaning he and little john greedily kept it for themselves what irony. Then the worst part of the film occurs the annoying children who are just disgustingly cute and cry like little babies and they just make the film even worse luckily after about 10 minutes they are gone for the moment. Then King John sets up an archery contest which should be near the end of the story not in the beginning however they did start the story in the middle but it still feels rushed. Of course robin wins and wears a disguise that would only fool a blind beggar but it fools the king and his guards and if robin had not been so egotistical about winning he could of left and the king would have been none the wiser. But eventually even the moronic King John catches on and tells his men to seize robin. However Little john is able to sneak up behind king john and of course when robin is found out he sticks a dagger in john's back telling him to let Robin go or he'll cut him. But the sheriff notices the kings strange behavior of letting robin go and sees little john threatening the king and sneaks up on john who get away without a scratch. They then escape there's a cringey scene with Robin and Maid Marian.The sheriff of Nottingham then arrests friar tuck and the king announces he will be hanged to lure out robin into yet another trap but being an incompetent oaf messes that up too and Robin is able to rescue all the captives in the castle because the guards are brainless buffoons. But then as they are escaping robin gets too greedy for his own good and steals too much gold waking up king john who alerts his men to attack but they fail as they lack even mediocre intelligence then everyone is about to escape but robin back goes back to save an annoying child at the risk of his own life and is cornered by the kings men but with them being idiots they let him escape and he flees to the tower where the sheriff is waiting for him and chases him while setting the tower ablaze and in the best scene in the whole movie it looks like robin about about to become fried fox but then jumps into the moat surviving the fall and the arrows being fired at him but makes them wait before surface to provide false drama then they all escape and king Richard shows up to arrest his brother and Robin marries Maid Marian and become an in-law instead of an outlaw. This robin is not the dashing hero like Errol Flynn in the Adventures of Robin Hood nor is he the more hardened warrior like Sean Connery in Robin and Marian the only other robin he's comparable to is Kevin Costner who also made a mockery of Robin Hood but at least that version didn't help to spawn the cringe inducing furries who draw animal porn and dress up in stupid costumes, yuck."
112,Robin Hood,9,4 February 2017,Great entertainment. One of the better 'lesser' Disney films,"An underrated Disney Classic. Disney was the man to beat back in the days. They have had a few missteps over the past few years, if you ask me. Frozen is one of the most overrated pieces of boredom in the history of cinema. Anyway, I'm going off topic because I want to make the point that even though this is a great film by any standards and age, it is in fact one of the lesser Disney animated features from Disney's silver age; after the death of Walt Disney. So yeah. The songs at lacking but the laughs are more than there. But more importantly, this film has heart. It is the classic tale of Robin Hood told in furry form before furry was a thing. I was going to talk more about this but I'm sure if you're reading this review than you've seen this classic already. The cowardly king John and his snake servant make this film exceptional."
113,Robin Hood,5,19 October 2015,"Robs from a rich tale, but gives a rather poor effort","I've never really had any love for Disney. I don't worship at the church of the mouse or get all weepy over it's iconography. So I'm judging its early 70s take on 'Robin Hood' strictly on merit, and sadly it barely gets a passing grade.Considered one of Disney's weaker animated efforts by even the most ardent of fans, 'Robin Hood' ambles along pleasantly enough, but it never displays any sense of purpose and ultimately never builds any momentum. The humor lacks wit and often falls flat despite the best efforts of a solid voice cast. Only their talent and the animation--which looks up to the usual Disney standards despite it's reduced budget and some cost cutting recycling--manage to rise above.Disney's 'Robin Hood' has it's charms, but they're likely to be lost on the young, and grownups are likely to be too bored to even notice them."
114,Robin Hood,8,8 September 2015,I wish all Disney movies were like this.,"Marked for spoilers just in case. May still be relevant despite the ageing of the story. For starters, I wish all Disney movies were like this. Like pretty much all Disney productions, this adaptation is horrendously inaccurate to its source material, that being both the original legends and the ""canonical"" story dramatised by the Robin Hood: Legend of Sherwood video game. However, this movie is greatly different from the others because of the prologue. Our Narrator of sorts, Rooster!Alan-a-Dale, starts with a prologue saying basically that this movie is going to be an original work. Don't expect the source material, expect a new story fashioned out of it by Disney for their own use. That is the huge difference right there. The annoying inaccuracy and such are still there, but it's better to establish that right off the bat so we can put that aside and speak about the movie. As for the movie itself, barring canonical fidelity of course, it is a decent production. It has its low points (mainly composed of cringeworthy humour and ""eccentric"" for lack of a better word bits), but for the most part it is classic Disney. Anachronistic, musical, funny, and quite memorable. One thing about Disney is that its work is memorable. Whether for good or for bad, it is always memorable. As for the story itself, it is internally consistent (mostly) and fairly amusing in itself. I don't recommend it for serious social watching, but I highly recommend it for casual enjoyment and especially for middle to low intensity class kids (the high ones are better off in the serious circles). Lastly, I raise my rating for the depiction of Friar Tuck. I'm not in favour of equality and representation and all of that, but as long as you people are at it you ought to raise the rating for having a legitimate priest in there, acting pious and zealous for the Lord."
115,Robin Hood,,3 August 2015,Fantastic medieval romp,"Robin Hood is Disney's version of the classic English folktale, including multiple elements from different retellings, including King Richard being away on a Crusade, evil Prince John ruling the land with an iron fist, Maid Marian and many others. It's also one of the most successful films from the so called scratchy era of Disney when they were using the Xerox copy paste method to make their films with a smaller budget.Robin Hood succeeds because it's just so likable. The style, for one, is nicely medieval. Everything, from the opening titles to the characters to the style of music to the dialogue, hearkens back to the Dark Ages and as a whole it's one of the best medieval films Disney has ever done.Another great thing is the character cast. This is a film of many unforgettable characters, from Robin Hood himself to Little John, from the sheriff of Nottingham to Prince John, who's the perfect example of how to make a complete wimp of a villain that's still a legitimate threat, plus interesting to watch. The side characters are also excellent and as a whole they're so good that the story practically tells itself.The one problem and the reason why I didn't rate this higher, is the fact that this film is notorious for borrowing heavily from previous films. Various dance and action sequences were copy pasted directly from The Jungle Book and Snow White, among others. The character of Little John is basically just Baloo with a green shirt. Sir Hiss, Prince John's lackey, is simply just Kaa with a hat and a cape. It doesn't ruin the film, and you really can't tell if you haven't seen the films in question, but it does mean that it cannot be called a perfect film.Nevertheless, Robin Hood is a great deal of fun. It's filled with thrilling scenes, one after another, has a great character cast, some good songs and as a whole it's simply entertaining."
116,Robin Hood,7,25 February 2015,Legendary outlaw in a daring Disney film!,"This is Walt Disney's 21st full-length animated feature film, where the fox hero Robin Hood and his bear sidekick Little John set out on a daring adventure to give money to the poor residents of Sherwood Forest. In doing so, they try to outwit the greedy lion Prince John and the cold-hearted wolf, the Sheriff of Nottingham, and stop them from suppressing the poor.This movie starts off with a captivating intro where Prince John had his brother, King Richard, hypnotized so he could rule the land in his place. This all leads to Prince John being outsmarted by a disguised Robin Hood and Little John in some jewels, resulting in a widespread manhunt for the outlaw.While this film has a basic and predictable plot and is slow at certain points, the story is actually quite entertaining and imaginatively fun - especially in seeing all the animals take on the roles of a legendary human tale and trying to survive a tax assault by the unscrupulous king and his cohorts. There are some great adventures and action - great excitement for the kids. There are also some humor that even adults might find enjoyable.The animation was pretty good, not as vibrant as earlier films or in later films of the 80s and 90s, but it is serviceable. The songs by Roger Miller has a nice country and comfortable feel to it and the music score by George Bruns is top-tapping fun and intriguing. Wolfgang Reitherman did a nice job directing and Larry Clemmons and the story team gave us quite a captivating screenplay.Overall, it's an adventurous Disney movie with a predictable plot, but has that certain charm and special ""Disney touch"" that the entire family would enjoy.Grade B"
117,Robin Hood,8,27 September 2014,A really good showing of the Robin Hood story from Disney,"This is animated telling of the Robin Hood story, and it's executed really well. I think it was a brilliant idea to make the characters into an animated animal form. It really does add to the more light- hearted feel of things. Robin Hood is how he should be, with his charm, wit and slyness. However the villains which include Prince John and his companions are just super incompetent, cowardly and dumb. To the point it's kind of difficult to really dislike them. Except maybe for the snake. Which does get kind of tedious after a while, because everything just seems one sided. But I guess the Disney team did the best they could with the running time and development. It's just cool to see Robin Hood all sly and mischievous while doing some rebellious tasks again Prince John and his men. Overall this is a entertaining and well made Robin Hood adaptation from Disney.8.5/10"
118,Robin Hood,8,14 August 2014,Disney at its finest,"Robin Hood the animated version is definitely one of my favorite Disney films. I first watched as a little kid and loved it and recently watched it again to find it just as entertaining. Anyone, young or old, can appreciate this film and that's about all I have to say. It's a great film that the whole family can enjoy plus it's one of those light-hearted films that just gives you a happy feeling. The voice acting is great. The comedic fight scenes are perfectly executed. This film is definitely a classic. I personally enjoyed it better than other animated films such as the lion king, which is why I'm giving an 8 out of 10"
119,Robin Hood,10,4 July 2014,Oo-De-Lally What A Movie!,"A very cute version of the Robin Hood tale. It's hilarious when it should be and feels very melancholy at the appropriate times. Disney did so well to capture the emotions of the characters that you can almost feel them yourself. A very comical movie.The musical numbers are good... the songs work well with the scenes and are not bad to listen to for a Disney family film. I used to try to whistle Roger Miller's ""Oo-De-Lally"" to my cockatiel who in turn would try to whistle it back to me. LOL, it's quite a catchy little ballad.This is an all time favorite Disney animation for me. I loved it as a kid and I still love it today. I can still laugh every time I watch this movie or even just thinking about it I can bust-a-gut with laughter.10/10"
120,Robin Hood,8,4 May 2014,Merry Menagerie!,"Disney take on the Robin Hood legend in animation form with family friendly rewards aplenty.Directed and produced by Wolfgang Reitherman (Sleeping Beauty/The Jungle Book), the voice work comes from Brian Bedford (Robin Hood), Phil Harris (Little John), Monica Evans (Maid Marian), Peter Ustinov (Prince John), Terry-Thomas (Sir Hiss), Andy Devine (Friar Tuck), Roger Miller (Allan-A-Dale), Pat Buttram (Sheriff of Nottingham) and Carole Shelley (Lady Cluck).All the characters are drawn as animals, with Robin suitably given a fox make-over, plot revolves around the dastardly machinations of Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham. Who find themselves hindered considerably by Robin and his band of merry men. Meanwhile Robin and Marian are rekindling their romance on the sideline. It lacks the class of other Disney animation movies, with no songs of note to tap the feet to, but the action is strong (love the archery), Prince John and Sir Hiss are great comedy value, and ultimately it's a delightful retelling of an often told wonderful legend. 8/10"
121,Robin Hood,9,8 November 2013,"A charming, hilarious and exciting Medieval Zoo ...","It seems like the same pattern governing Walt Disney's animated movies released between the 'Golden Age' (from ""Snow White"" to ""Cinderella"") and the 'Renaissance' (from ""The Little Mermaid"" to ""Tarzan"").First, they're inevitably compared with their glorious predecessors hence rarely meeting with the critics' expectations of something on the same league than ""Bambi"" or ""Fantasia"". However, in their mighty magnanimousness, they reckon the entertaining value of the film and never doubt its capability to please each member of the family. And rightfully so, the film meets with popular success and becomes a box-office hit, generally throning on every year's podium. And a few decades later, the film is an instant classic.What I just described applies to ""The Jungle Book"", ""The Aristocats"", ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" and ""Robin Hood"" is hardly an exception. The adaptation of Walter Scott's novel (or the animated remake of the Errol Flynn classic) carries the mark of that particular period where low-budgeted Disney studios recycled old footage and reused the same animation in different scenes I thought the most blatant case was ""The Sword in the Stone"" but ""Robin Hood"" isn't beyond reproach either- at the end, we get a rather rudimentary approach to animation which isn't on the same vein than blah-blah-blahI stop here, because I'm bored by my own review, as if the very rationality I'm expressing was depressing both the little kid I was and the grown-up I became, as both saw the film with equals levels of excitement, fun and enthusiasm. So, if ""Robin Hood"" offers a fair share of action, humor, music and romance, that anyone would expect from a Disney film, do any technical consideration matter? ""Robin Hood"" has always been a cheerful legend, the iconic outlaw who stole from the rich to give to the poor is such a flamboyant, rebellious and romantic hero I could never picture him without a smile on his face, whether from Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn or Disney's fox. The stroke of genius is to populate the film with anthropomorphic animals, which has never been done before, even in ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""The Jungle Book"", animals were still coexisting with men.In ""Robin Hood"", it's a whole medieval zoo created with the perfect animal for each character. The hero is as clever, fast, agile and intelligent as a fox, his strong and jovial friend is a bear and the victims of Prince John's tyranny are all fragile and weak animals: owls, rabbits, mice or raccoons. As for the villains, the treacherous sheriff is a wolf, the Prince, naturally is a lion but deprived from the obligatory mane as to emphasize his immaturity, his counselor is sneaky like a snake, his troop is made of elephants and rhinoceros lead by a raspy-voiced crocodile.(And now that I think about it, I noticed that the good guys are all animals from the farm or forest and the bad ones from the jungle, as if it had to show the poor habitants of Nottingham as the unfortunate preys of greedy predators (Little John is a bear but bears have sweeter tastes), as if dictatorship was the only the socialized version of the 'law of the jungle'.) It's obvious that since the creation of Mickey Mouse, Disney films could never do without animals, even ""The Sword in the Stone"", which was set in the same period than ""Robin Hood"" approximately, featured many sequences where Merlin and Arthur were turned ones. My guess is that it probably has to do with the wide range of animation it offers and the way animals enhance children's imagination with a great use of colors and diversity in movements drawings. This is the main appeal of ""Robin Hood"" and had the film featured humans, I don't think I would have cared much about it when I first saw it at the age of 5.I remember the film was recorded from an Italian channel and I could hardly understand a word, but with this unique touch of marvel animators' magic hand bring to their film, the whole adventure excited me. As a teenager, I still loved it, and as an adult, I started to notice that the film carries many pleasantly surprising aspects.""Robin Hood"" is perhaps the first film to talk about 'having children', 'marriage', some cute naughty innuendo like when a rhino whistles at a disguised Little John, waving his stocky posterior, that's not usual Disney material. Even 'God' is uttered many times and a few political matters, notably when Little John questions the morality of their actions.Sex and politics have always been forbidden themes in Disney movies, but ""Robin Hood"" tackled them without hurting any sensitivity. The film is cleverly written and the dialogs' wits are highlighted by the voice-over, which is strength of the film, especially from Phil Harris who reprises his Baloo-role, and Peter Ustinov who's absolutely delightful as the royal Mama's boy, sucking his royal thumb with an irresistible baby moaning voice, or shouting ""Seize the fat one!"" during one of the film's zaniest and most exciting moments when the aftermath of an archery tournament turn into a football game parody.At the risk of repeating myself, that's the stuff that family movies are made of. I myself just turned into a father and I'm looking forward to make my daughter discover the film like I did with her grandpa, that's the magic of Disney classics, their appeal is both universal and timeless. And who can't resist to that little whistle tune that open the film and reflects the cheerful mood of the story, just the thought of it erase any piece of criticism.Not that the film is flawless, it's just that the flaws don't really affect it. It's fun, full of bright colors, hilarious, catchy and 40 years after, it's a classic. ""Beauty and the Beast"" might be superior, but I wonder how many Disney fans would choose it over ""Robin Hood""."
122,Robin Hood,9,23 April 2011,Not really accurate adaptation but sure the most fun,"Although I liked the concept of an outlaw stealing from the rich to help the poor the story of Robin Hood never did much to me. I found all the movie adaptations pretty rough and uninteresting, but that's how it was in those times. Disney however made this story into something more fun to watch. There are no humans in this animation but all the characters from the story are played by animals. Robin Hood and Maid Marianne are foxes, little John is a bear and prince John is a lion just to name a few. They are all humanized however and can talk. Humanized animals is a concept that often causes for fun scenes and this movie is nothing short of that. The funniest scenes in my opinion are between the Sheriff of Nottingham and his stupid guards, and not to forget the big fight at the tournament with Lady Cluck simulating some kind of rugby game. Yes Prince John is mean and cruel but he is also naive, childish (thumb-sucking) which makes him laughable. This is surely one to watch over and over again. I don't think this movie would have turned out that well had it been humans playing the characters."
123,Robin Hood,9,1 April 2011,Dinsey classics are always great!,"I just love these classics! Disney used to be a great company with fun shows, and in this case the cartoons were great, entertaining, had a moral to them, made you laugh, made you cry, made you smile. Here's a classic I just got through watching and sure enough, I enjoyed it. Cried here, laughed there. It was very entertaining.I am sadden by the way Disney makes their films these days. Most of the time, it's junk. Which is why a story like this makes me appreciate the good old days.I rate this 9/10 because I think it's a perfect example of a classic cartoon movie with a good story, good characters, wonderful music, great comedy, and perfect romance. :)"
124,Robin Hood,8,26 February 2011,This Is Soooo Richard Scarry,"man. was this film intended to be so much like Richard Scarry? if it wasn't, then the resemblance to the works of Richard Scarry is extraordinarily similar. this really does seem like Disney adapting Richard Scarry.that's just fine with me. i love Disney and i have a lot of respect for Richard Scarry's anthropomorphic creations. Richard Scarry delighted me as a child and still does, although i find the books to be aimed at very small children so i don't read em anymore. but i still dig Disney as an adult so i find this combination of Scarry and Disney to be a delightful blast of fun.'Robin Hood' is also one of Disney's best cartoon features for the toddler set. most all of Disney's cartoon features aim at acceptance from an older more mature audience, 'Robin Hood' doesn't seem particularly concerned with adult appeal. that's just fine and that's also what i like best about it. it requires less involved thought then the other Disney films and has far less ambitious and lofty pretensions. not every work of fun or entertainment has to be ""high culture"" or serious ""art"". this is one of Disney's most ""laid back"" films animated or live action, and definitely one of Disney's least pretentious. which is saying a lot because on a whole, Disney is not very pretentious. Disney is a art form that is made to appeal to middle America and it's traditional values.i was really surprised and appalled to read that some people actually thought the detailed, full animation in this was terrible or shoddy. even some viewers liked the film but thought the animation was bad. so much for pearls before idiots. this is not a matter of opinion. if you think this is poorly animated you know nothing about the art of hand drawn animation. not only was a lot of time, care and money lavished on this feature, there is so much nuance and detail to the animation, especially in the prison escape sequence toward the end. if you can't identify or see the detail then you are obviously in too much of a hurry and not paying attention or using your brain. saying the animation here is poor is just plain stupid and unfair. use your eyes and brains folks.Disney's 'Robin Hood' doesn't even warrant or elicit that kind of judgmental criticism in the first place. it's not exactly a film that is mired in self importance. Disney's 'Robin Hood' cartoon is a very easy going experience and should be taken as such. it doesn't have that kind of ambition or reaches that far as to be taken too seriously. and the wonderful hand drawn animation reflects it's simplicity as entertainment. anyone too critical is trying to make too much out of this and perceive this as something it's not. if you try to make too much out of this charming little film you've gone over the deep end and you need to get a real life.Disney's cartoon feature of 'Robin Hood' is a cute and charming little film with terrific animation and character vocals by some fine and engaging actors. it also boast some catchy and memorable music by Roger Miller. the whole film is a total delight from beginning to end and very Disneyish.i feel sorry for the people who were too overly critical of the animation and this film. how can you be critical of something as simplistic as this? being too critical or having a problem with this film is, well, sort of 'Scarry'."
125,Robin Hood,8,28 May 2010,A solid animated version,"I saw this version of _Robin Hood_ when I was a very young child. I liked it so much, my parents bought the soundtrack album, and they seldom did that. It's fun and lighthearted, and like most Disney animated features of that time, very safe for kids. It's arguably not a classic, but it's well worth seeking.All of the characters of the Robin Hood mythos are present: Robin (a fox), Maid Marian (ditto), Little John (a bear), Alan-a-Dale (rooster), Friar Tuck (a badger), King John (lion), the Sheriff of Nottingham (a coyote/wolf?), and many more. The comedic interplay is great, and the music is highly enjoyable."
126,Robin Hood,7,13 May 2010,A Unique Take on the Robin Hood Legend,"Over the last 40 years, there have been a number of adaptations of the Robin Hood legend, but the animated feature from Disney is the most unique of the bunch since it features the characters such as Robin, Maid Marian, Friar Tuck and Alan-a-Dale as animals. The one character that's new to the Disney version was Sir Hiss, a snake voiced by Terry-Thomas.I remember seeing this movie when I was 12 and really liked it. One thing I remember is that Alan-a-Dale was a rooster and voiced by Roger Miller, who wrote and sung three of the movie's songs. Miller was part of an outstanding voice cast besides Thomas that included Brian Bedford, Phil Harris, Peter Ustinov, Pat Buttram, and two actresses who played the Pigeon Sisters on The Odd Couple, Monica Evans and Carole Shelley.If you haven't seen the Disney version of Robin Hood, rent it. Just like the title of one of Roger Miller's songs, it will make you say ""Oo-De-Lally."""
127,Robin Hood,9,1 April 2010,"Deliciously animated, great adaptation with a disappointing ending","Could Disney ever do wrong during their golden age? As far as their adaption of Robin Hood goes, not likely. This is an absolute gem of a film, both well-written, animated, cast and presented. It takes what is already a well-known tale and adds a real depth to it. The ageless story is presented (and the movie itself acknowledges it, to my delight) in an animal kingdom form. It follows the quest of outlaw Robin Hood as he robs from the rich and gives to the poor under the nose of tyrannical Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham. With a little help from his friends - amongst them Little John - he just might save them from the evil lion's tyranny. But of course it's not so easy - nor is his quest for the hand of the fair Maid Marian.The animation in this movie is absolutely delicious. In the leading hands of such geniuses as Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, I'm not surprised. The old-fashioned Disney style (pencil strokes quite evident) never fails to inspire me, and in fact is at its absolute height here, in my opinion. The character design and animation is all spot-on - Robin is a foxy fox, Little John is a not-at-all-little bear, Prince John is a lion, the Sheriff of Nottingham is an overweight wolf, Sir Hiss is a snake, the royal guards are rhinos and Prince John's squire is a crocodile. All these diverse characters are impeccably believable and entrancing to behold. Both Little John and Sir Hiss might be considered extensions of Baloo and Kaa in the Jungle Book (indeed, both retain their respective voice actors). However, this is only a passing reference, as both characters are strong enough to stand alone (not to mention is Little John more of a straight-man than Baloo, and much more responsible).For the animation itself as well as the whole animal setting, I'd say 5 stars are nowhere NEAR enough. The story is also fabulously written. Believabilty of the characters is stronger than in any Robin Hood incarnation that I've ever seen. You totally feel the despair of the poor people, and absolute hatred for Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham - in fact the latter is the character I personally love to loathe.However, while the story itself is quite strong, the ending is very disappointing to me. If you don't want me to spoil it for you, I strongly suggest you skip the rest of this paragraph. After a heist and a breakout of the royal jail conducted by Robin and Little John, the scene fades away from Prince John's frustration. Then when we take off again, King Richard has returned and our rooster narrator/folk singer says that ""he sort of straightened everything out."" Given the strong character- and story-build-up, this is NOT something I wanted to hear! The 'show, don't tell' rule that Disney were so good at following is broken here, to my immense frustration. Sure, we see the evil cronies in chains. But given all the loathsome things they do during the course of this film, I wanted to see them humiliated for all to see! By King Richard as well as the rest of the bunch. His return should have been emphasised much better, as a kind of symbol for the people that the bad days will end. The ending, as such, feels like a real anticlimax.But despite the disappointing ending, the movie itself is a quite impeccable visual work - fluid and eye-candyish 2-d animation with more charm than today's CGI-ridden features can even hope to achieve. Disney's Robin Hood signifies, to me, what animation is all about. And despite my faults with the ending, it remains one of my favourite films of all time - and a film which inspires me in my ambition to become an animator myself. Bravo and thank you for the marvellous job, Disney!"
128,Robin Hood,7,7 February 2010,The Broken Clock is Right Twice a Day,"Here we have the second film in what I consider the ""bleak years"" of the Disney canon that while doing everything I abhor in animation, still manages to make me like it all the more. I cannot bring myself to love it, but actually liking a film from this period says a whole lot.I am a Robin Hood junkie. I have watched nearly every adaption available and it does take more than turning my hero into a fox (very sly- bravo Disney!) to deter me from this ageless story. More specifically, it takes Kevin Costner. I can't say this really improves upon the story to make everyone talking animals, but at least it doesn't make everything thoroughly unpleasant. In fact nothing really can kill it: the anachronistic folk-country music, dodgy American casting, the stupid XEROX outlines (yes, even I am getting tired of harping on it), the massive loads of recycled animation not only from within the film but icons of previous films, or the overall laziness this film was apparently treated with based on the assumption that when you market to kids, quality no longer matters. Do you know no shame, post-Walt production team???And it probably comes down to personal opinion, but mashed all together this stuff just works. Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas as Prince John and Hiss make the lamest of Disney villains into some of the most watchable- rather than fearing them, you just want them to go on to see what will come next. I also admittedly enjoyed Brian Bedford as Robin and though the casting of jazzy American Phil Harris as Balo- errr, I mean Little John should be bothersome- who can really help but adore Phil Harris?The music is hopelessly out of tune with the setting of the movie, and even with itself from song to song- how in the world does Love end up right next to The Phony King of England?- but blast my ears if I don't love it anyways.So even after telling myself there is no possible reason to or way I could like this Robin Hood, I do. It throws all the conventions of how to make a proper animated feature out the window and then proceeds to spit on them. Yet all this roguish thumbing of the nose only further endears this outlawed film to my heart.Quote of the Film:Taxes! Taxes! Beautiful, lovely taxes! Ah-hah! Ah-hah!"
129,Robin Hood,10,7 January 2009,Disney classic preaches and entertains,"Robin Hood and Little John fight the forces of the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John and help feed the poor.Walt Disney is quite possibly the greatest story teller of all time. Not only do his animated pictures excite and entertain us, they all have an encoded message that preaches towards its family audience. From the being in the right place Jungle Book to the circle of life in the Lion King Walt has become legendary.This 1973 animation has an equally impressive story and message as his previous releases with a memorable score and riveting narrative.Retelling the infamous story of outlaw Robin Hood and his adventures in Sherwood Forest, this adaptation isn't afraid to go political for its message. We see a strong issue driven narrative that sees the greedy Prince John take from the poor to feed his wealthy life and the torments that the poor residents go through is almost tear worthy.Although being very political and issue driven, the film is not without entertainment and fun value.Seeing Robin Hood dress up in humorous disguises such as a gypsy, a stalk and a vulture will have the kids engaged to the narrative. The fact that the characters are all animals makes the film easy to view and appreciate without taking away the importance of its preaching politics.The humour is a fantastic advice to portray the personalities of the characters such as Prince John's baby sequences and Lady Kluck's ambitious and forceful antics, watch out for the football parody, one scene which never fails to steal the moment.Being Disney and an animation, this is a great introduction into the life of the poor and rich which children should really appreciate.Simple and with enough information to contain this is a gateway to a better understanding of grown up issues for the younger viewer.The animation is as usual top notch from Disney but story aside the element which steals the limelight is the beautifully written score.Combining so well with what is happening on screen; Robin Hood finds the right mood at the right time to make it believable and equally enjoyable.Not as strong as Jungle Book or Lion King per say but there is nothing to be faulted."
130,Robin Hood,7,21 December 2008,Robin Good ! (DVD),"As a kid, the only Disney I watched were ""Snow white"", ""Jungle Book"" & ""Aristocats», thus being an adult now, I got a lot of movies to discover. Five years ago, we wanted with my twin brother to do the list from the oldest and we picked up ""Pinochio"": it was so slow that we felt asleep on the sofa.A recent friendship made me look after ""Aladdin"" and now, ""Robin hood"". For this one, I wanted a summer vacations funny movie. The kid didn't like it (again too slow) so I watched it alone and have a really good time.England, medieval times are among my favorites interests. In addition, it's above all a comedy and without a lot of choregraphied songs! When I notice that it was released in 1973, I'am truly amazed. The movie is among my oldest I have seen and as nearly my age, I can tell it ages much better than me, ah, ah! In the DVD, you got also a Mickey cartoon from 1933, making me realized that the Disney company had a tremendous monopole over family entertainment: nearly 60 years (of wonder, like they said!). It's paradoxic but when Disney was the only one, they delivered great classics and since they have newcomers, they didn't have a great hit (I don't count Pixar movies as Disney)"
131,Robin Hood,10,14 April 2008,An uncut gem is still a gem,"I did not grow up with this movie. In fact I was closer to 30 when I first saw it. Funnily enough I find it the most charming and human of all the Disney movies I've seen, despite it being played by animals. It could be the timeless humor and joyfulness in it, the theme of oppression against evil, the down to earth music or the lack of ornamentation. Or maybe it's simply the digressions and the flaws that does it. It's like a long therm relationship, where you love the other person as much because of her flaws as for her good qualities. I highly recommend seeing it - it will cheer you up."
132,Robin Hood,8,8 June 2007,One of My Favorite Disney Cartoons,"I LOVED this cartoon as a kid. I was and am an animal lover anyway, so the idea of Sherwood Forest being populated by a bunch of talking animals delighted me.My favorite characters were Prince John, the hapless lion with his crooked crown, and his right-hand man (or snake), Sir Hiss. I especially enjoyed Prince John's unique way of robbing ladies of their rings, which was to suck them off their fingers while he was pretending to kiss their hands.The highlight of the film is the famous archery contest that turns into a wild and crazy football game. All these years later, I wonder if that section of the film was tipping its hat to the equally delirious football game in ""MASH."" Grade: A"
133,Robin Hood,10,13 May 2007,over looked,"This film was my first movie as a kid. My dad is a history teacher and he wanted me and my sister to know the story I guess. It's full of witty humor , action , music, and romance (Pretty much any type of film rolled into one). At the time the movie was released there were other films out (The Jungle Book , The Aristocats) so most people don't really think it was a Disney cartoon . As a young adult watching it, I find memories flying back to me. The highlight song of the film is the ""Phony King Of England"". It's bouncy , catchy and I still find myself singing or humming along. The highlight scene is definitely the big fight at the end. There is one scare but in true Disney fashion the bad guys faces the consequences and the hero and his lady love are married.But it's one film that I certainly enjoy even now and will be thrilled to have my children watch it too someday."
134,Robin Hood,9,23 March 2007,Refreshing,"This movie was so much fun to see again. So many animated movies today are for adults first and children second. This story of Robin Hood was truly a family movie. The humor, though not as excellent as ""The Jungle Book"", was really good. My kids haven't stopped talking about certain scenes. They like to act out some of the silly scenes, especially of Prince John. And I don't have to explain anything to my kids because of lines being written over their heads. I think this tells us where we were in the early 70's for children's entertainment and where we are today in the 00's. I did recognize some of the same voices from previous Disney movies, but that has always been their trend. I prefer not recognizing celebrity names that distract from the story, but that just can't be avoided. I just really enjoyed it."
135,Robin Hood,10,16 March 2007,"A Delightful, Up-Beat Disney Treat.","While it is obvious Robin Hood may not rank amongst Disney's finest such as The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and the Little Mermaid, it is in no way awful!This plot retells the timeless story in a kid-friendly fashion without compensating for quality. The music, while not exactly dazzling, is fun and enjoyable. The characters are irresistible and their voices match perfectly. Phil Harris, Brian Bedford, Monica Evans, Peter Ustinov and Terry-Thomas play their roles well and bring forth the personalities of each character from the charming wit of Robin Hood to the sweet demure of Maid Marian. The script is chock-full of witty banter and memorable speech. All things considered, Robin Hood is a lovely movie with something for everyone to enjoy."
136,Robin Hood,8,3 March 2007,Excellent Animated Robin of Sherwood,"To introduce your children to the Robin Hood story, this one does a very good job. There are many qualities it has that make a child want to watch it over & over again. This is the official Disney animation of the Sherwood Forrest bandits.The Roger Miller soundtrack is great, & even adults can appreciate what the old King of The Road singer put into composing his songs for this movie. The music is contemporary & catchy. Phil Harris has a great song in it too. The music appeals to everybody.Add to that, a lot of fine voices for the animated cast in this one. This is one of the first animated films that really got a lot of good celebrity voices. Some of the animated sequence drawings very much resemble the live action ones in the 1938 classic too.The story is told slightly differently & the script actually has some real fun with the characters & brings the story to a new lifestyle as Robin Hood is a fox in this story.My favorite quote in this one is from Friar Tuck, ""Parise the Lord & pass the tax rebates!""."
137,Robin Hood,7,3 March 2007,Robin Hood goes American -- with surprising success,"This is Robin Hood given the good old American folksy treatment to help it go down with Disney's domestic market: the characters adventure around the 'village' of 'Notting-Ham', the cutesy bunnies worship 'Robbinood' and the Sheriff has a 'posse': doubtless the only sort of Sheriff those Saturday-morning audiences had ever encountered... But the amazing thing is that really, it does get away with it. Half the characters may be upper-class and the other half hoarse-voiced American gangsters, the songs may be lacklustre (weirdly enough, I heard this first in a dubbed Scandinavian version on board a ship going up the Baltic -- it's a long story to explain -- where the singing seemed much better), but the story of Robin Hood is pretty robust, and it can survive almost anything save being taken excessively seriously. Robin Hood is the trickster of English folklore, a wicked merry rogue, and the worst thing you can do to him is submerge him in meaningful gloom; no danger of that here.For what could be more impudent and wily than a clever red fox? Half the humour of the film consists of watching the archetypal characters matched to appropriate animals: the ponderous spearmen as rhinoceroses, the trumpeters as elephants, burly Little John as a bear, Prince John as a mangy royal lion, Marian's nurse as a plump and flustered hen (with a lone and inexplicable Scottish accent...). I confess I could do without the obligatory Disney child-characters (""Aw, they're kiiiissing!""), but at least they don't have any significant role to play in saving the day -- that would be just too nauseating. The little church-mouse-deacon and his wife, on the other hand, are a nice touch.Given its general child-friendly remit, the film does a pretty good job of painting its villains in a convincing bad light, showing them stealing a child's birthday present, squeezing taxes from a cripple by jarring his broken leg (with the infamous tax slogan 'if it isn't hurting, it isn't working!'), and emptying the poor-box. From the very first scene, we are reminded that things are getting more dangerous for Robin and his band: even Robin has to admit that the Sheriff's men are getting better. And while Prince John is an ineffective villain, his intentions are gratifyingly ruthless: none of those infuriating scenes where the Evil Overlord dithers around giving the hero a chance to escape. Earlier ""Robin Hood"" pictures are referenced in the sequence where Robin is trapped just the wrong side of a portcullis as his companions escape; but there is no effortless swarm to the top and over the gates here. In one of the genuinely nail-biting pieces of action, our quicksilver fox ends up cornered in a burning tower, climbing ever upwards as the flames rise, and rapidly running out of options...The film has its flaws, although I'm not sure the lack of an overarching plot is one of them: the Robin Hood legends and ballads never really had one, being a long list of apocryphal exploits strung together. The ending is a definite cop-out, though, jumping directly to the happy-ever-after epilogue without any intervening action at all -- it's as if someone just got bored of writing and decided to stop dead. What it does have in abundance, and what some of its live-action rivals disastrously lack, is a saving sense of mischief."
138,Robin Hood,8,20 December 2006,Robin Hood,"The film focus only one a few merry men and the poor peasants. When we did see Sherwood forest was after the romantic scene with Maid Marion. Robin had a pig, cat, dog, jackrabbit on drums and two foxes or wolves by the looks of their paws clapping to the music in the party scene.During the tournament escape scene, the posse were chasing after Maid Marion , the only person who was behaving and not doing anything wrong or against the law. This is the niece of Prince John, guys? why are you chasing her? She cries for help and her hero, Robin Hood fends one off with his sword. All posse were carrying a spear or spears when they started to chase Maid Marion. Where did one of them get a sword? Thanks goodness Robin Hood push a throne on them? Shouldn't they be arresting Lady Kluck or one of those peasants, Little John, a female wolf, or someone else who is actually breaking the law?"
139,Robin Hood,10,29 November 2006,A True Disney Classic for all members of the family,Robin Hood is one of the best told stories ever told.There have been many different versions of the story told. But this one is told with animals.Disney true has made some classic movies and this has to be one of their very best.You have some of the best hand drawn animation ever seen in a movie.Of course the music is more of a Disney style and it is very well done.The voice acting is top notch.And the jokes are sure to make you laugh.Overall Robin Hood is one of Disney's classic and one movie that is never a problem.I give Robin Hood 10 out of 10.Classic movie
