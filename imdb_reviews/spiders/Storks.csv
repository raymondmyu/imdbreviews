0,Storks,7,25 March 2017,Threadbare. Uneven. Underrated. HYSTERICALLY Funny.,"I found STORKS in the way that you're supposed to find underrated/cult classics: by accident. When it was released, I bought into the collective sigh of underwhelm that most critics expressed and that was my mistake. It's easy to understand why the critical community didn't like it: in an era where Pixar, Disney and even Dreamworks keep churning out magnificently multi-layered heart-warmers that set the bar stratospherically high, STORKS doesn't register all that well. We've been spoiled by excellence. As a result, we've lost the ability to enjoy the simple pleasures of pure entertainment.And that's what STORKS delivers better than babies or packages: entertainment.You might have noticed people commenting on how forced and thin the storyline is and how uneven it feels, and those complaints are accurate. The plot is extremely thin (virtually an extended sitcom-sized premise stretched into an epic road-trip format), and the story moves so quickly that it goes too far too fast with nary any breathing room to savor the experience or give the characters the tension or time to build any real catharsis or change. But the characters are so authentic to themselves that you know just about everything you need to know about them from their first scenes.I think the main reason STORKS gets such middling reviews in print and here on IMDb is because it's an old-fashioned type of comedy: a screwball-slapstick hybrid. The emphasis on sight gags, pain-humor, and wackiness has generally been avoided in animated films as passe and vulgar--low comedy. The rapid-fire snark between the main characters of Tulip and Junior hearken back to the old Howard Hawks workplace comedies of the 1930s, which is definitely an acquired taste in the post-narrative style of humor found in kids entertainment today--where non-sequiturs and punchlines exist in a vacuum and visual comedy is derived from abstraction rather than plasticity. But the comedic energy and the variety of jokes from modern ""Office""-style cringe (Pigeon Toady) to the machine-gun-speed HIS GIRL FRIDAYy-style verbal sparring (Tulip & Junior), absurdism (the wolves), post-modern meta-humor (the boy and his parents) to classical WB slapstick of yesteryear, and the film is riotously funny because of it. At the end of the day, that's what STORKS wants to be: FUNNY.STORKS is not a great film. It's not a masterpiece like TOY STORY or UP. It won't win any Oscars and it won't be everyone's cup of tea. But there's an excellent chance that it will live on as a multi-generational favorite for the same reasons as dumb-fun-with-a-heart-of-gold treasures like SPACEBALLS, DUMB & DUMBER, THE NAKED GUN, and NATIONAL LAMPOONS CHRISTMASs VACATION:Because you can watch it 1,000 times and it will NEVER stop being funny.So try it out. There's a 50-50 chance you'll be among the ones who can't stop watching it."
1,Storks,8,29 October 2016,Highly Underrated,"I entered to watch Storks expecting the worse. However, I got an really enjoyable movie.The Characters are charismatic and they have good chemistry. In Fact, I LOVED Tulip and The Wolfs were hilarious.If you want a funny and heart-warming film, then Storks is a great option for you.It's such a shame to see how uninterested was Warner in marketing this film.I Trust that in a few years Storks will have the recognition that it deserves, and a big fan base."
2,Storks,10,12 January 2017,Underrated - this movie is one of the best animated films out there,"If you want a movie that is entertaining, funny, action-packed with twists and turns throughout - then this movie is for you! The animation quality is as good as any out there. The voice actors are sensational. Kelsey Grammar and Andy Samberg and their back and forth bantering is totally brilliant and any of us involved in business can understand the dynamic and completely understand the humour.It is one of those movies that you can watch again and again and never get bored.Kids love it and there is plenty of content to keep adults laughing.This movie is a terrific and I can't understand how anyone could not thoroughly enjoy this movie!"
3,Storks,8,23 September 2016,What a cute and adorable movie!,"Watching this movie in the earlier parts, I could not help to feel that the funny scenes were a little bit forced, but as the movie continues, the funny scenes becoming more and more fluid. The funny moments became more natural. And since the baby girl was ""produced"", the movie became much more alive. I think the star of the movie was really the baby. The animation of this baby was soooo cute and adorable that you would really want to hug and play with the baby.You would also be enjoying the very colorful scenes and the funny moments during the chase by the wolves. Those were some of the most enjoyable moments. But the moment that I laughed the hardest was during the scene involving penguins (and the fork). It was priceless!I also loved that the trailer shown many times in the theaters was only showing some brief introduction about Storks and baby making machine. This helped us to be enjoying the movie without knowing there were so many plots inside this one. For parents who want to bring their children to watch this, I believe they would be able to enjoy it. For teenagers & adults, this movie would also be enjoyable to watch. However, please do not expect logic or the making sense of the story of Storks delivering babies. If you can only enjoy movie when logic is very much a great factor, then I do not think this movie is right for you. If you are looking for some fun and good laughter, then you can definitely watch this one!By the way, this movie was produced by Warner Bros Animation Group (WAG) which also produced The Lego Movie. Hence, it was not a surprise to see there was a short funny animated Lego movie of a Chinese Kung Fu Master and a chicken before the start of the movie. I guess WAG also wanted to follow the success of such pattern used by Disney, Pixar and even Illuminati (remember those cute minions in The Secret Life of Pets ?). It did give us a nice thing to enjoy before the start of the actual movie. So when you already bought the tickets for this film, please make sure you are not late to be able to watch this short fun movie.please read my full review in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"
4,Storks,8,8 October 2016,Tulip is awesome,"I admit that while it's not one of my favorite animated movies of the year, it's still definitely something I would recommend. I admit that it does start a bit slow. It really gets better when the character Tulip is introduced. She is the heart of this movie and by far the most entertaining part. Thank you for featuring her so much. Almost everything she says is funny. I guess I just have a soft spot for genki girls. Pinkie Pie is the one who comes to mind most at any time. She even has red (pink?) hair like her. The best parts are probably her interacting with her personas.I admit that the story makes little sense. How exactly are babies brought into this world now? We briefly get to see the process of how a baby is made. I love how big and epic this movie gets. Yes, it's technically short, but it still gives you everything you would want in a good movie. They have a lot of great details and it leads up to an exciting climax. As a huge fan of ""The Lego Movie"", you have to watch the great short that precedes this. If only ""Looney Tunes"" did stuff like that nowadays. It's great to see a good movie based on an original concept too. ***"
5,Storks,4,20 June 2017,Very boring and chaotic,"Storks seemed like a good kids movie you would watch just to get out of the house and go to the theater, but I found that storks is very boring and fast paced. Many of the jokes fell flat and felt forced, speaking of forced, the parents. The parents are absolutely terrible characters and suddenly go from being responsible to downright stupid and unrealistic. Many of the scenes are rushed and the characters actions and dialogue left me confused. Over all, storks is a waste of time movie to watch once and never again."
6,Storks,10,23 January 2017,"Fast paced, hilarious, absurd and slightly evil","Saw it on a long flight, had never even heard of this movie before despite us watching anime and cartoon regularly. What happened there WB?? So I ended up seeing it more by coincidence - the same as many other adults on the 5 hour flight. And the plane was full of laughter. One of the most absurd and hilarious movies I've seen in a long time. It is very fast paced, lots of word play and verbal humor, slightly evil in touching all kinds of topics from career-nuts adults, over-ambition and sacrificing it all, bullying, casual nastiness to people. Delivered by a fast-talking, bright, very cheeky teen girl with a big heart and a stork trying to keep up and sorting it all into his very structure perspective on life. Go watch it!"
7,Storks,3,22 September 2016,A decent enjoyable flick!,"First thing of all, this is the kind of a movie that's surely not for everyone and it doesn't really give that stereotype where children will absolutely have fun watching it. The storyline follows a group of storks engineers a vast industry relating to delivering babies to their respective families. Things go south when the living storks are tired by umpteenth of accidents occurring on arriving the destination that eventually turns into an industry of selling goods. With the help of an unknown boy, an unintentional event takes place for re-living back the old era of the storks.The plot is fairly decent, and it does give much time for the character to develop but it takes too many spaces in their limited duration of the movie. It drags the movie at certain parts that we won't be needing to see. Despite all of this, there are a few sequences that do take place abruptly, leading to many inevitable questions. Children that are trying to learn and understand stories may get confused with 'em. The pacing is half the chance being good and bad, people will judge in their own way. As for me, it starts to get bad after 40 minutes in.The humor here is enjoyable, but it can get cringe-worthy sometimes. Basically, the script is telling the characters to force the jokes from themselves.As far as I can tell, there are moments in the movie that trigger your mind if this movie is really worth spending your money for. The motion images are tolerable, it's totally not as bad as Norm In The North and totally not as good as Kingsglaive Final Fantasy XV. The moral values here are worth it but it does not contain as much as you have seen in Inside Out or Toy Story. A major example that can be taken is to give love to each member of your family without regarding career or any other things.The best time to watch this movie is when you're having a daytime off with your family on a Sunday afternoon. Overall, it is an enjoyable flick and to my point of view, it deserves 5 out of 10."
8,Storks,8,7 October 2016,"An adorable film, that the whole family can enjoy.","Storks tells the story of Junior(Andy Samberg), who is a stork. Storks used to deliver babies but, they stopped. Now, they deliver packages to various people around the world. However, an unfortunate mishap causes a baby to appear in the stork headquarters. Now, it is up to Junior with the help of the human girl Tulip(Katie Crown), to deliver the baby before any other stork finds out. Storks is a brilliant film. Director Nicholas Stoller has successfully made the transition from hilarious adult comedies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall(2008) & Neighbors(2014), to equally funny family-oriented fare, like this movie. The animation is top notch. The 3D is immersive & has some duck-worthy moments. One minor flaw with this film is that, the humor is mainly slapstick-oriented. However, this is my personal opinion. Kids & their parents will thoroughly enjoy this film. The babies are the highlight of the movie. They are cuteness personified. The voice acting is flawless. Andy Samberg is outstanding as Junior. Katie Crown is spectacular as Tulip. Kelsey Grammar is mind blowing as Hunter. Jennifer Aniston is great as Sarah Gardner. Ty Burrell is amazing as Henry Gardner. Anton Starkman is awesome as Nate Gardner. Keegan Michael-Key is hysterical as Alpha Wolf. Jordan Peele is hilarious as Beta Wolf. Danny Trejo is excellent as Jasper. Stephen Kramer Glickman is unforgettable as Pigeon Toady. Storks is a must watch, particularly for families. Go, have a jolly good time!"
9,Storks,2,14 February 2017,"So overrated. I hate this movie,","Directed By: Nicholas Stoller and Doug SweetlandStarring: Andy Samberg, Jennifer Anniston and Kelsey GrammarOverall: With 'The Jungle Book', I believe this is one of the most overrated movies of 2016. I think this movie is boring and stupid. I wanted to like it but I just couldn't.Good:1. The animation is pretty good.2. Two jokes in the whole movie made me laugh.Bad:1. I was falling asleep during this film. It was so boring and so incredibly unfunny that it was impressive.2. They just tried too hard to be funny.3. The story was just stupid and the idea was just absurd.4. All the characters were boring and dull and just uninteresting.2/10"
10,Storks,,14 January 2017,Family entertainment,"This film tells the story of a delivery company run by storks. They stopped delivering babies for many years, until one incompetent employee broke the rules and created a baby for delivery.There are many reasons to like ""Storks"". The animation is super cute, and the story is very sweet. Most people would connect with babies, making this film an easy success. The wolves are funny too. However the broken heart has gone just one step too far as it gets too repetitive and non functional like the other formation of the wolves. I also like the literal downfall of the boss. Adults can relate to that too. It is rare to see a film that can be enjoyed by all ages. I liked it."
11,Storks,7,6 January 2017,Big surprise,"Storks wasn't specifically on my watch list. I had seen ads here and there, but it seemed to get overshadowed with the release of other movies. When i got the chance to watch it on a flight, i took it. Mostly because there was nothing else to watch. I ended up laughing out loud a couple of times and being charmed by some of the characters. The movie was cute and a little awkward at times, and had a fun and not too serious premise. The awkwardness is especially what drew me in. This movie might not be for everyone, the comedy might be a bit too obvious and cringy, and kids might not understand the humor at times. I personally don't think those are bad things, since i enjoy that type of humor. The voice acting was okay. I mean Andy Samberg was Andy Samberg and Ty Burell was Ty Burell. I enjoy both actors very much, but it made it hard for me to get into their characters. Stephen Kramer Glickman, Kelsey Grammar and Danny Trejo were outstanding in their performance. Overall this movie was a fun ride, and took me by surprise. I got a little lost in the storytelling sometimes, and wasn't sure what 'message' they were trying to convey. But overall it was enjoyable and cute, and not every movie needs a 'message'. I'm not sure if every kid will enjoy this movie, but i think adults who like awkward humor and great animation (I forgot to mention that) will enjoy this movie. This movie is definitely underrated and got drowned out by other (hyped) animated movies that got released around the same time. 7,5"
12,Storks,2,12 December 2016,Simply Awful!,"One of the more annoying cliché American animations! I rarely have such an averse reaction to cartoons, but this was a seriously irritating waste of time :-(... Don't know why I even put myself through this nightmare! Was it a lack of story line or the lame characters? Whatever the case this thing must be aimed at retards!!! One of those sad cases where you root for the two-dimensional main characters to fizzle out as soon as possible!!! Save yourself an hour & a half, and don't bother with this rubbish! Given that IMDb require me to write a novel of 10 lines for this review to be admissible, here goes: rubbish, terrible drivel, not worth watching, shame on Warner Animation Group, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Stoller Global Solutions for taking up screen time with something so unimaginative! Is that 10 lines now?! Oh goodie!!! Over & out!"
13,Storks,9,9 January 2017,best cartoon so far in 2016,"After watching the trailer I got excited for watching the Storks movie and the promises where at least 'good fun'. Storks is undoubtedly funny and keeps up with the audience attention just enough in spite of an at par performance in pretty much all departments. Let me start by saying that I don't this film is a 10/10 but hopefully my rating will add to its overall rating. This is a best cartoon for family.Stork Mountain was a place known for delivering babies and its employees are primarily storks, along with a few other birds. Their current CEO, a stork named Hunter (Kelsey Grammar), discontinued the baby delivering business, seeing more profit by having storks operate a parcel delivery service called Cornerstore. Tulip (Katie Crown), having just turned 18 years old, is working to promote new ideas for Cornerstore, but they always backfire. Meanwhile Junior (Andy Samberg), Cornerstore's top delivery stork, is about to be promoted to boss of Cornerstore while Hunter is the boss of cornerstone now and he will be chairman of the board. Hunter demand Junior to fire Tulip but Junior cannot find the heart to fire Tulip due to her kindness and hard work, and he lies to her that she is being transferred to the mail room, instructing her to never leave her new office space.Meanwhile, a young boy named Nate Gardner (Anton Starkman) feels lonely because his parents, Henry (Ty Burrell) and Sarah (Jennifer Aniston), are too busy to spend time with him and he want to have another brother. Nate Gardner found ad about old stork deliver baby and he writes a letter asking for a baby brother with ninja skills and sends it to Cornerstore. The letter makes its way to Tulip, who reluctantly leaves the mail room to put the letter in a slot just outside the room despite Junior's attempt to stop her, injury his wing in the process. To their surprise, a baby girl is created inside a metal container, whom they later name Diamond Destiny.Junior agrees to secretly help deliver Diamond Destiny. As Junior's wing is broken, they use Tulip's flying machine for transportation. However, they crash into a frozen tundra and they met group of wolfs who leaders named Alpha (Keegan-Michael Key) and Beta (Jordan Peele). The two manage to save Diamond Destiny, whom the wolves have fallen in love with baby. At last, Junior, Tulip and baby diamond escape from group of wolfs.Back at Cornerstore, a pigeon employee named Toady (Stephen Kramer Glickman) learns of Diamond Destiny's existence. Toady told Hunter about the baby then he promises to give Toady Junior's position as the boss as they scramble the coordinates Junior and Tulip have been following to mislead them to a different location. Junior is captured and tied up by Hunter and his cronies at the false location and they kidnap Diamond Destiny. While Tulip follow the Jasper to her lost family. However, Tulip comes to rescue Junior without having met her family and the two resend themselves back to Cornerstore. After fighting an army of penguins, Junior and Tulip are chased into the abandoned baby making room and start up the machine as a distraction. As thousands of babies are being made, Hunter angrily confronts Junior and Tulip with a large robotic machine, but Junior refuses to surrender Diamond Destiny with Hunter's re-offered promotion. With the infant's playfulness, Junior and Tulip are able to cause the machine along with Hunter to fall off the cliff elevating the collapsing Cornerstore.Junior rallies the storks, as well as the other birds, to help deliver the babies to the families who wanted them including the Gardners, and Nate accepts having a sister when he realizes that she has the ninja skills he asked for in the letter. The storks, former employees of Cornerstore, and the wolf pack reunite Tulip with her expanded family, and she and Junior continue their job of delivering babies as co-bosses of Stork Mountain."
14,Storks,10,4 December 2016,A fast paced and really funny animation with great character voices.,"Ooh where to begin.After watching the trailer I got excited for watching the Storks movie and the promises where at least 'good fun'. And now after watching the movie I can just say, what an awesome roller-coaster ride of fun. Laughing throughout the whole movie, without the movie getting boring or losing any real tempo.From great and funny animations, characters, to the facial expressions of the characters and just how the whole movie looks in terms of style. The (English) voice overs that just match perfectly with the characters and not one boring character in the movie.Through the years there have been some really good and funny animations, but I don't think I have laughed so much through a whole animation movie since 'Tangled'. And there have been some really awesome animations the last few years.For me Storks has been the sleeper comedy animation hit of the year. So If you want a good laugh and/or the trailer makes you already excited, go watch it with an open mind and let the movie take you on a ride of fun."
15,Storks,3,17 January 2017,Hectic and Hard to Watch,"This movie was very hard to watch. The hectic pace and scatter-brained delivery of the ""Tulip"" character left both my wife and I occasionally wandering the online world looking for relief. The story line was cute, but all the jabber-jabber-jabber behavior. Frankly, speaking most especially of Tulip, any child of mine that acted with such disrespect toward others. We did like the character of Jasper played by Danny Trejo and liked the revenge of the small angry-birds, but the show just didn't rank with us. Lastly, we're supportive of homosexuals, but delivering a child via stork to lesbians? Storks deliver adopted children? There comes a point where representation is no longer valuable, and that scene felt more like indoctrinating children than including same-sex affection into mainstream presentation. But, I suppose that's the world we live in --- one where political inclusiveness appears more important than actually making a good story (or, at least, one in which the inclusion of the scene has anything to do with the movie at all)."
16,Storks,4,17 October 2016,What tried to be a rival to Pixar quality came out as awkward,"How many people, do you reckon, came into the theater with their young, impressionable kids, and right in the middle of the movie, the young kid asks ""Mommy, where did I come from?"" I swear this is going to be the flick that makes more kids question things than Zootopia. However, unlike Zootopia, being the 10/10 movie of the year (so far) that it is, Storks is... awkward, and very blatantly strange. It really tries. It truly does. But it's left as a footnote to much better movies.The animation is quite the breath of fresh air. It feels unique and new. But animation alone isn't going to get you anywhere in life. Story and characters are where the spotlight is shown... or so you wish.All the characters feel awkward and unfunny at best. At their worst I wished I could leave the theater. I ask you, what was the ""villain's"" (if you can call him one) intentions? What were they? Outside of Jasper, not counting him. The OTHER, more ""plot twist-y"" villain. Except it's not a plot twist. It's just... he doesn't want storks to deliver babies anymore? Then why does the movie feel the need to make him sound evil about it? All that happened was that a tattle tale little pigeon told him something was up, and he... puts on his evil persona and moves on? I guess? Oh and that little pigeon is the single worst character I've suffered through in some time. Bar basically none.The story is decent, but not nearly enough substance. It has like 2 set pieces, and even then you have to suffer through the characters.Enjoy if your standards are low. Otherwise, my advice is to avoid."
17,Storks,1,4 February 2017,Awful movie,"I have been using IMDb to view ratings for years, but I had to create an account to review this movie.Storks was truly awful. Even our 4 year old said he didn't want to watch it after about 15 minutes. Thank goodness because we were also not wanting to watch it anymore (Two adults and a 14 year old).Our son will watch almost anything, including some of the low budget animated movies you find on Netflix.The conversations the characters are having seem quite odd. They are talking fast with random comments that don't really seem to fit any narrative.It was like watching a bunch of ADHD characters amped on up caffeine spouting out random thoughts to try and be funny. Sure, a few moments like that can be funny, but we just did not find much humor in this movie."
18,Storks,4,7 October 2016,Expecting a different kind of entertainment,"I saw the previews of this movie months ago and was watching for it. The audience was mostly adults, surprising for an animated feature that is presumed to be aimed primarily at kids. Not hard to figure the story has something to do with the old myth that babies are delivered by storks. The delivery system failed one child who grew up among the storks. She is stereotypical of the girl/kid main character who talks at an unpleasant pitch with sassy, sometimes in-you- face cracks in almost every cartoon story lately. They came along as animation turned from timeless stories to tales with dated, faddish, words and phrases. An example is ""Oh, snap."" But originally the prospect of lots of cute little cartoon babies and how the story would develop was enticing. It turned out there wasn't much use of the babies.There was a lot of irritating squawking, much too loud. Was it the theater's sound system? I doubt it. As it turns out, this story was not light and at one point a scene of destruction brought a child behind us to loud sobbing. At this time the sights and sounds were overbearing and unpleasant. If I had attended on my own I would not have stayed to the end. This could have been so much more. I rated it a ""4"" for the quality of illustration/art."
19,Storks,7,25 September 2016,Well-made movie with good animation and super score on cuteness factor,"Storks is undoubtedly funny and keeps up with the audience attention just enough in spite of an at par performance in pretty much all departments. The movie doesn't have any wow factor, except for the ""baby cuteness"", but I didn't find it bad either. Story (7/10): I've heard about this concept for the first time, but apparently, storks, in some mythologies, are associated with baby delivery and that's what the story is about. In the modern times, though, they have moved away from baby delivery to cell phones. However, in a dramatic turn of events, one of the soon-to-be-boss storks, Junior, is unable to prevent the restart of a baby-making machine by Tulip - the only human at the facility, which creates a baby. Along with Tulip, he has to not just hide it from the rest of the storks at the facility, but also deliver the baby. And in that process, he has to prevent the babies from external enemies as well. I didn't find the story so exciting but what I liked about it was the screenplay that had good punches - although inexplicable on some occasions. What I also loved the most was some of the innovative stuff with wolves and penguins, which was innovative and great to watch. The characterization of Tulip and establishing her chemistry with Junior was a little tricky but the writer managed to do it pretty much smoothly without making it looked forced. Overall, a pretty neat job by Nicholas Stoller. Animation (8/10): The animation is really good, especially the ones on creating various baby faces and expressions. It was pretty much like they poured in all of their energy into that. Also, the work around landscaping and making the entire visual very colorful is great. Direction (7/10): The combination of Nicholas Stoller and Doug Sweetland has pulled out quite well. While the former hasn't had a great run with the movies yet, Doug's experience with the animation movies seems to have come handy, even though it was a first time for him. The idea of getting wolves creating amazing shapes - totally fitting into the context of the story - and the silent fight with the penguins was great. However, the direction could have improved in the beginning of the movie, which was a little slow and low on momentum. Overall (7/10): A well-made movie with good animation and super score on cuteness factor!"
20,Storks,1,20 October 2016,"Horrible, waste-of-time movie","Storks was a horrible movie. It was inappropriate for kids and adults. I would not recommend anyone to waste their time watching in theaters or at home. It's sad nowadays that movies are being released with ""kid"" ratings and ""towards"" kids when its seemingly obvious that its toward a non-intellectual audience. Wish I had read the reviews before I hadn't thrown my money down the drain. I had started off with enjoying the movie, the jokes were different and unique until towards the end when a inappropriate scene was included that was two to three minutes long. Seems I have to stick with Disney, Pixar, and BlueSky movies. Where there isn't suggestive, crude, or hidden scenes in children movies. Take my and other people's advice. You do not want to waste intelligence."
21,Storks,9,8 October 2016,"Refreshing, heartfelt and entertaining.","Impressively, Bad Neighbours and Forgetting Sarah Marshall director, Nicholas Stoller directs his first animated movie along with Pixar animator/director Doug Sweetland about, well, Storks as a global delivery service that USE to deliver babies in the mythical, traditional sense and now deliver electrical goods instead. We follow Junior, who's likely to inherit the position of booosssssss once Hunter (Kelsey Grammar) moves on up, however his first task of the day is to fire Tulip, the human catastrophe orphan that wrecks havoc whenever she decides to help. As expected, and as the trailer suggests, things don't go to plan and there's an incredibly adorable baby involved who needs delivering to her wanting brother, which leads the unfortunate pair on a funny, haphazard adventure. The Lonely Island comedy superstar Andy Samberg voices Junior superbly, I didn't even recognise the voice, actually sounding much older than the Samberg I know and he works so well with animated voice actress Katie Crown who voices Tulip. Watching the relationship form and crumble between the two was entertaining, witty and touching. The creativity with this film is brilliant and the animation itself stunning. The penguin silent fight, the love-lusting wolves with incredible yet hilarious group-abilities it pushes the boundaries even for an animated movie and actually parodies itself in parts, ""what are the chances of that?"" They manage to squeeze in quite a lot for 87mins, not saying that it drags because it really doesn't; it's fast paced, quick-witted and loaded with silly action that ignores plot holes and just skims right over them. Again, really not a bad thing and purely there for comedy effect. As with all good family movies, there's a couple of good strong moral lessons here which are quite touching and honest. Sharing family quality time and asking the question, what is family? Or, who are family? You could hear the ""awww"" from the audience and yeah, I was touched only to then be made to laugh at the heartache watching Junior trying to comes to terms with it all. There's a good soundtrack with tracks from Jason Derulo, REO Speedwagon, Talking Heads and Vance Joy with a great original track ""Holdin' Out"" from The Lumineers. Brothers Mychael and Jeff Danna do a typical animated score covering a wide stream of styles and sounds to help emboss the mood and atmosphere of the story. I enjoyed this film from start to finish, finding it hilarious, entertaining and heartfelt. I really hope the kids enjoy this as much as I did. I could go watch this again. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 7 Script: 8 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the sharp wit, the wolf submarine with sonar pinging wolf and the silent fight. Would I buy the Bluray?: Yes! 87% 9/10"
22,Storks,7,1 November 2017,Wacky Flick for the Whole Family,"In 2016, Nicholas Stoller (Get Him to the Greek & Neighbors) and Doug Sweetland (Presto) presented Storks, an animated film from Warner Bros. Animation Group (The Lego Movie). While it had a mixed critical reception, it's definitely a movie that typical movie-goers and families may find adorable and funny?The main plot centers on a stork company that delivers packages and babies. When the top delivery stork, Junior, becomes boss of the workers, he is told to fire the only human working there, Orphan Tulip. Instead of firing her, he sends her to the defunct mail room. Meanwhile, the son of two workaholic parents, Nate Gardner, sends a letter to the company asking for a baby sibling to play with. When the letter arrives, it creates a baby, so now Junior and Tulip have to deliver the baby to it's guardians while going through many obstacles like avoiding getting noticed by the company's CEO Hunter, a pack of hysterical wolves, and trying to care for the baby itself. In concept, the film has all the right ideas to make a charming comedy for the whole family, and it mostly succeeds in it's execution. Even though the journey Junior and Tulip go on feels similar to almost every Pixar film (e.g. Inside Out and Finding Nemo), the film gives the characters enough time to develop off each other, where they came from, and what each other's goals are, even if their quirky eccentric personalities don't always contrast that well. The subplot featuring Nate and his family, however, does come off as rather straightforward and it's easy to guess what will happen since all his goal is to have a baby sibling. It doesn't help that the movie itself does come with some tired film clichés, not just the duo who overcome each other on their obstacles, but also the workaholic parents who try to make their son happy, the big promotion from one job to another, the side villain finding out where the heroes are, and even how the main villain tries to get rid of the protagonists.As for the rest of the characters, the CEO of the company Hunter at first comes off as a trustworthy boss, but there's quite a nerve he has with babies which presents him as threatening and cunning. The pigeon Toady can either be amusing or annoying with his exaggerated ""bro"" voice, but he's also a decent deuteragonist as he only follows his orders to make the most of his job. As stated before, the Gardner family have the same trope of the little kid who wants his busy parents to spend more time with him, so they decide to bond with him more to make him happy. And then there are the wolves led by the alpha and beta, who deliver the absolute funniest parts of the movie due to their personalities constantly shifting from menacing to energetically adoring the baby, as well as performing the best visual gags in the film.However, if there are two things this movie really nailed in the execution, it would be the heart and the humor. The filmmakers definitely knew when to have cute sentimental moments with the baby, and they always come off as adorable instead of schmaltzy. Also, when the movie's main characters have their moments of relief and sentimentality, it gives the film a lighthearted tone that never comes out randomly, and portrays the scene with just the right emotion to make the audience feel for them. However, the humor would have to be the highlight of the movie, as there's plenty of one liners, visual gags, surprisingly decent pop culture jokes, slapstick, subversion and line deliveries, and it's very rare when they miss their mark as they have such exquisite timing and charm to them. Also, since Junior and Tulip do spend the journey caring for the baby, they spend time feeding and trying to put the baby to sleep, which also makes the movie relatable to any parents who raised their own offspring. Since the movie acts more on the cartoony side, it creates the animation to be as cartoony as it can, and it did the job beautifully. The characters look kinda simplistic, but given the silly nature of the film, they contrast well, and their movements can get exaggerated and wacky at just the right moments. Although some of the places they leads go to range from a cave, to the Arctic, to suburbs, the animators still give the backgrounds life and present them in colorful, unique, vibrant, and bright manners. The effects animation is also quite creative such as the factory robots, the water, the machine that creates babies, and even some of the lights and electrical effects. The only criticism there is to give the animation is that many of the storks look like the exact same model (probably by means of cheaping out a bit), but they don't ruin the sporadically wonderful quality that the visuals have to offer.While Storks may not have flown as high up as other animated films of 2016 such as Kung Fu Panda 3, Zootopia and Kubo & the Two Strings, it did offer enough good laughs, silly concepts, well crafted animation and memorable characters to stand on it's own. If you're in the mood for a cute little family comedy with some relatability to those who have raised babies before, then this will be a delight from beginning to end, especially since it knows who to aim itself towards. If Nicholas Stoller and Doug Sweetland can do this good of a job with cartoony movies, then I can't wait to see what they have in store next for animation.like Captain Underpants, nice job Nick."
23,Storks,5,19 December 2016,I expected a little more.,"Storks is an animation even with an interesting premise, but I found it badly used, the animation is not bad, but there are some weak jokes, moments without thanks, and characters that you will probably forget the next day, plus the cast of dubbing Is good, Adam Samberg, Katie Crown, Stephen Kramer Glickman, Jennifer Aniston, Ty Burrel, Kelsey Grammar, Danny Trejo, and etc, the soundtrack is just okay, the script is weak, the film has few memorable dialogues, most are From good to weak, have funny moments, but are not moments for you to laugh at the movies, or at home, Storks is weak, has weak moments, a good and competent dubbing cast, the soundtrack is just cool, the script is weak , Plus Storks may be a good call to take the young child to watch. Note 5.5"
24,Storks,1,14 August 2017,Nope.,"I was so disappointed. This is possibly the worst cartoon I watched. At 44mins in, I haven't laughed once. It is borderline painful to watch how a somewhat cute idea was so badly delivered. The script is just ridiculously awful and forced with idiotic jokes. I expected an easy to watch, cute kids movie, but watching Storks became almost a challenge to see how long can I endure wasting my time watching this pointless thing."
25,Storks,7,14 January 2017,Totally underrated movie,"I admit this movie is not on my watch list.In the beginning of this movie I can't stop my mind to think why they create this world-a world the baby is delivered by storks.This is no sense and totally different world with the real world.Why? In the end of movie I think it give me the reason.In the final scene, the storks start to deliver baby again we can see so many family receive a baby include Same-sex marriage couple.In such a Utopian world, we don't need a man and woman to get a baby. We just write a letter to storks.I see so many good idea in this movie.Baby is most wonderful thing in the world no one want hurt baby > Everyone told you that you want to be boss, but most important is what do you want to do after be a boss The funny scene in this movie make me laugh loudly"
26,Storks,5,30 September 2016,Gave me a clearer perspective..,"I wanna ask first what comes to your mind when you hear the word Baby? I wanna make that a hanging question. So is this film any good? Like pixar good? No, in fact it tried so hard to be. The punchlines just doesn't hit the right spot and even if it did they were fleeting right away. It did made me laugh but there was no fun. Its anthropomorphic world is not easy to get and its eccentricity became annoying and unfunny quirks. Junior and Tulip are too frenzied like they were high on something. Though I will rate this film 5/10, Storks had given me a clearer perspective, that final scene hit me like an epiphany and now when i hear the word baby, I think of family."
27,Storks,10,9 October 2016,A Really Sweet but Funny Movie,"Hey Guys GravityFalls2 Here again & today I'm reviewing the movie I just saw today called Storks. The Movie is about a Stork named Junior (Andy Samberg) who is the top delivery stork. His Boss Hunter (Kelsey Grammar) wants to make him boss by firing the orphan girl Tulip (Katie Crown). Meanwhile a Boy named Nate wants a baby brother because his mom & dad are too busy so Nate goes to find to get a baby brother by hoping stork will deliver it. I also like to point out there some good music in this movie like Like The Talking Head's ""And She Was"" & Vance Joy's ""Fire and The Flood"". I really liked The Wolf pack how they turning to things. Bottom Line A Really Sweet but Funny Movie. I really enjoyed this Movie a Lot. Anyway I give Storks a 10"
28,Storks,5,13 December 2016,Tries to hard and fails,"This movie tries too hard to be funny it just ends up being awkward. I slightly laughed maybe a couple of times, but mostly I was left groaning at the lameness of it all. The whole wolf scene where they all turn into different things just wasn't funny in any way. I usually like quirky and silly humor.. but it just felt too forced. I'm not sure what was going on between the stork and the girl, either. Was it friendship, was it more than that? I don't know, but it was weird. My daughter seemed to like it though, but I didn't really hear hear laugh that much either. In the end it wasn't too bad, the plot was decent and some of the characters were OK and that's why I gave it five stars."
29,Storks,9,1 January 2017,Surprisingly great and extremely funny,"I have to admit, the subject material for the movie didn't entice me to watch it. But once I did get around to seeing it, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience! Though I found the two leading characters (Junior and Tulip) to be the most bland characters in the whole movie, this was easily mediated with by the many, many, redeeming qualities of the movie. From the colourful, original and hilarious supporting characters, to the lovely animation and design, through a fast paced, original, and twist filled script and the dynamic editing and flow of the movie. More then anything else, though, what I found most enjoyable about storks was how downright funny the movie was. Jam-packed with jokes and funny moments, the laughs-per-minute count was off the chart, with many memorable and hilarious moments. The movie was a joy to watch and to laugh to, and I recommend it for any constellation- be it to watch on your own, with friends, or the whole family."
30,Storks,6,18 December 2016,More for kids rather than families,"Storms no longer deliver babies, they have moved into light freight. The top delivery agent needs to get the last baby (now 18 years old) off the property so he can get promoted.The main characters are quirky and interesting with some very funny lines.This looks good on paper but I just didn't warm to it. The story is weak even for a kids cartoon and I didn't really like the animation style, which is very clean and bright. I think this may appeal to children more.I didn't love this, but I didn't hate it either. I think this is aimed squarely at a younger audience. I chuckled a number of times but lost interest a number of times."
31,Storks,7,26 November 2017,Brief exposure to baby cuteness!!,"Here's a Better Late than Never review of ""Storks"" (PG - 2016 - US)...Pretty adorable!!Genre: Animated/FamilyMy Score: 7.4Cast=8 Acting=6 Plot=4 Ending=9 Story=6 Art=9 Voice=10 Music=6 Family=10 Funny=6Storks have moved on from delivering babies to packages. But when an order for a baby appears, the best delivery stork must scramble to fix the error by delivering the baby. ""Just a brief exposure to baby cuteness can ruin your life!"" This actually turned out to be a special delivery...not first class mail, but I was willing to sign for it. Although I did not like the premise, this ultimate family movie more than caught up with some great voice overs and a solid ending. Your wolf pack will not form a broken heart after this one...it ended up softening mine. I recommend this for families with younger children...the cute level was a high 8 with a diaper and big eyes."
32,Storks,10,18 November 2017,Definitely one of my favourite animated movies ever!,"***May contain spoilers*** When I sat down to watch the movie I had neutral feelings..A friend suggested it to me and I checked the trailer immediately. I really liked it and I was already laughing on the silent fight scene at the end of the trailer,so I decided to watch it that night. BEST CHOICE OF THE DAY! While watching the trailer I felt kinda weird about watching a movie where storks deliver babies and basically most of the scenes are about a baby,but then I started watching the movie. My God! I was literally smiling trough the whole movie...Because of the jokes,cute scenes and for god's sake...That heartwarming ending. I feel free to add that even a few tears came out when Tulip flew away with Jasper to find her family,when the baby was finally delivered and when Tulip was reunited with her parents and family.. The whole movie made me melt. The characters were just WOW..I could totally relate to Junior and Tulip as well...Junior is that type of person who is not sure about what he really wants,the one trying to seem tough but is the one who's the most emotional and who needs the most love,who's kindness,care and softness grows to the end of the movie. Tulip is simply the best kind of person you can ask for a friend. She's kind,loving,loyal,she's funny,she's energetic and very joyful. All she seeks is her family,but once a baby has to be delivered,she's ready to sacrifice her machine built for the role to fly away and find her parents to help the baby girl find her family first,hoping that she can find her's too eventually.Tulip and Junior are #friendshipgoals. They fight a lot,but they realize that they can't be without each other. Also they can perfectly work together to solve various problems together,as a team.The visuals of the movie are amazing.. The movie was ADORABLE! Not only the visuals (of course Diamond Destiny did the thing) but the story itself..The movie is about ''finding your flock''.. Is about finding the real meaning of your life,finding your family,finding happiness,finding that thing which makes you feel full. It's also about the time spent together with your loved ones on the Gartner family's perspective. Nate is a very honorable character as well in that case and seeing the parents actually being there with him, being there for him is heartwarming.This movie is a roller coaster of emotions..In the beginning,you may feel confused,questioning the story and the logic of the movie,then you start enjoining it,smiling at the many jokes the characters make, blasting out in laughter at the wolf chasing scene,melting during the scenes featuring the beloved trio (Junior,Tulip and the baby) and you'll even feel some tears rolling down your face time to time. If you're an emotional snowflake like me,you will find yourself finishing the movie in tears,but with a wide smile.The soundtrack is one of the best things in the movie. Even as a huge metalhead,I found myself singing She Was,Fire and the Flood and Holding Out every day after watching Storks. I added the songs on my list right there among Arch Enemy and Nightwish and whenever one of them starts,I'm grabbing my phone to turn it up.I suggest Storks for those who want to be a part of far one of the cutest and funniest stories ever made. Some people may think it's childish,but always look for the actual meaning and the story it tries to tell,your opinion will change with a good chance.I simply love it! (Sorry for grammar mistakes..English is not my native language.)"
33,Storks,9,12 November 2017,Cuteness OVERLOAD !!!,"Lots and lots & Lots of cute babies in the movie. The concept of the movie is very simple. Its hilarious, emotional (at times) and very touchy movie. I would recommend this movie to all age groups right from small kids to adults. Great movie for entire family.Hope you all will like it."
34,Storks,10,26 July 2017,"This Movie is Really Great, Deserves My own Oscars xD","In my opinion This is the best Animation movie of the year 2016 and frankly 2017 too :DI dunno why this under rated, coz this movie is really funny, has a good story, very very nice Animation and production,I must say though that storks delivery company would defiantly beats Amazon. hhhhhhh, obviously Amazon can't deliver kids :Dthis movie is actually asks you a question, for the life, for your purpose. for your existence, your might be in a wrong place but that will never limit your imagination and spirit and your ambitious dreams to make them come true.. i loved the spirit in the movie it's really incentive.i really really enjoyed watching that movie. it's adventurous Action a lot of comedy . also i admire very much the animation work and effort that has been done to the movie, it was Amazing and yet sooo much funny :Dall of that made me watch it two times , and i definitely give it a 10 , thumb upGreat thanks to all of the team, i would really recommend you see ityou will never regret thathave fun ;)"
35,Storks,,6 July 2017,Storks is the BOOOOOOSSSSSSSS!,"What a hilarious movie! When it came out in theaters I thought it would be another lame excuse to tell a useless story and fill it with adult-oriented but sugar-coated jokes. Nevertheless, when my daughters rented this movie, I reluctantly decided to give it a try, preconceptions aside, but having low expectations.It turned out to be one of the funniest, most touching animated movies I've seen in recent times, and it's been years that either Disney or other companies have come up with something I really enjoy. My suggestion is that you give it a try.Storks not only provides good comedy, it also touches on serious aspects of life (in a hilarious way), such as the stress that comes upon a baby's arrival and the need for kids to spend quality and quantity time with their parents.Andy Samberg and Katie Crown take the lead, their arguments throughout the movie are not only hilarious but based off actual new-parent's experiences. What make that and every other scene or line in the movie is that you can completely relate, this is intelligent/deep humor we're talking about. I recommend it!"
36,Storks,8,22 May 2017,b movie,"Storks have moved on from delivering babies to packages. But when an order for a baby appears, the best delivery stork must scramble to fix the error by delivering the baby.The story was very unique and useful for the kids to understand the important of family, and never judge a person from its look. The voice Andy Samberg and Katie Crown duo voice was amazing and funny in the film, Kelsey Grammar was great in his sentences. The music and sound effects were not that good, but the graphics were amazing."
37,Storks,10,16 May 2017,An extremely fun and delightful experience,"This movie was what I was expecting from an animated movie, funny, cute and with a touch of inspiration and real life value. The movie talks about the Storks who run a company, cornerstore . com who used to deliver babies, I'm not going to go way too deep in the plot or give spoilers, but all I can say that, it's really fun to watch and is very humorous, and is a great, clean, fun entertainment for the whole family."
38,Storks,8,14 May 2017,The wolves.. THE WOLVES.,"Highly recommended. The movie constantly makes fun of both itself, and family-raising tropes and injects the importance of communication in digestible doses.Although I don't have any spoilers in here, I do mention a couple of specific scenes. This won't ruin your experience of the movie, I promise.This is a great entry into the 'animated family friendly / oriented' genre. The beginning was a little slow to be sure, possibly uninteresting, even.... but 10 minutes in and I'm hooked. It had great chemistry, and the mom-dad type interactions between some of the character pairs were clearly inspired by parents who have been there, recently enough to remember the humour and challenges of early child-raising. That's clear, even to someone who's never had children of their own.Emotionally, it tugs at a few strings, but not to the point of needing tissues; it's light and humorous, tackling the importance of family bonding in a positive way.Warning; If you have young ones going to see this, I think that you should likely make sure they know where babies come from, as this film raises this question in a provocative way, and young inquisitive minds..... well. Let's just say it's a question that begs an answer.Also, the wolves. oh and the penguins. Both are hilarious and cleverly done, and the movie using silence in a creative and funny way to make light of how every-other-film-ever uses mood music to artificially amp up action scenes.Genius."
39,Storks,7,3 April 2017,"A silly, but fun movie.","""Storks"" is one of those movies that looked pretty bad from what the trailers advertised. The film looked like a very stupid comedy made by Warner Animation Group, the studio that took the world by storm with ""The Lego Movie"". It also didn't help with the writer of the film was Nicholas Stoller, a writer I wasn't very fond of (he wrote the new Muppet movies which I really don't like). But, much to my surprise, I did like this film. Was it great? No, it wasn't a movie I'd watch over and over again, but for the most part it was fine. Not a bad kids movie as the advertisements made it out to be, but certainly not great. It has problems that hold it from being a complete piece, but it was a fun movie to watch.We all know that babies are delivered by Storks, delivered through the clouds from a mountaintop, but unknown to us humans, the storks are getting annoyed delivering the babies as they are problematic and get the storks into some serious danger. So, they decide to quit and move into the online store business forming a sort of Amazon clone called Cornerstone.com. And so, eighteen years later, a stork named Junior (Andy Samberg)  is about to be promoted to boss by the CEO of the company Hunter (Kelsey Grammar) after being the top deliver of packages for the company. But before he can become boss, he has to fire the only human employee of the company, an eighteen year old named Tulip (Katie Crown) who is in fact one of the reasons that the storks quit baby delivering eighteen years ago. Unable to fire her though, Junior moves her to the mail room in the old baby factory with really nothing to do. However, after a optimistic young boy named Nate Gardner sends a letter to Storks asking for a baby brother, which accidentally creates a baby, Junior (who accidentally broke his wing) and Tulip decide to quickly deliver the baby without the company knowing so Junior can become boss.""Storks"" seems really silly from the way I wrote the plot, and yeah, it basically is. But, it's silly in a good way. It's fun and funny at times which is usually high praise for a goofy kids movie. It's animation is great. It's colorful, fast, and sometimes, it can be pretty to look at. The characters of the movie are also fun. I particularly like the character of Tulip. She's goofy and silly and has a pretty funny scene with her playing other people out of boredom with nothing to do in the mail room. Junior is funny at times. Although he wasn't great, I had some respect for him in a way. The wolves (Key and Peele) are also pretty hilarious too. Wanting to make the baby part of the pack, they actually would do anything to get it back, even taking on the forms of different kinds of object like boats, submarines, even a bridge. My biggest problem with the film is I think it would have been better of as a Cartoon Network miniseries rather than a movie based on the way it was edited. The film would randomly cut to black and then start again oddly as it was edited like a miniseries made into a movie. It took me out of the experience for a while, but I was able to get back into the goofy nature of the movie.So, would I see ""Storks"" again? Probably not, but I will admit that I did like the movie for what it is. A silly, but fun animated comedy. With good characters, some bright animation and a fun story, I thought it was a pretty good kids film. Not great by any means, but fine. While it is not a must watch, I think it's worth one watch if you have the time."
40,Storks,7,5 February 2017,a Good film,"Storks is a solid, well-made movie that viewers of all ages should be able to enjoy. It doesn't scale the emotional heights of some of 2016's other animated offerings (like Zootopia and Finding Dory), but it still has important morals that speak volumes to kids and adults. The positives outweigh the negatives, and Storks' merits make it worth checking out on the big screen. Families looking for a fun time at the theater won't be disappointed by what Stoller and company have to offer them. well ! after I finished watching this film, I quickly added to the list of my favorite films. Wolves were my favorite characters, they've made me laugh hard."
41,Storks,10,4 February 2017,Just adorable..,"Storks have moved on from delivering babies to packages. But when an order for a baby appears, the best delivery stork must scramble to fix the error by delivering the baby. Storks is no ""Finding Dory"" for sure but just like always you can't do no wrong with animation like this or a cast of very well done actors, most of the humor was actually pretty well done and i laughed with the wolves mostly, the friendship between the little baby, the stork Tulip was very well done and it was pretty heart breaking at times. Overall this was a very well executed movie with a great story, soundtrack and an excellent animation and who knows there might be a sequel too. (A+)"
42,Storks,8,25 January 2017,Amazing,"I watched this a few nights ago and I just bawled my eyes out. yes, the story makes little logic, but I think that is the point. It isn't meant for critical eyed adults who scrutinize everything but for kids to enjoy. however, it is a light hearted and funny movie with hidden jokes for adults and I believe it is suitable for the whole family. I absolutely loved it. the ending had me in tears. there are some hidden meanings in the story, about acceptance, and what it means to be a family and cherishing those around you. it carries a great massage hidden within the comedy. someone in a vouge article said that the comedy fell flat, and to that I say f** off it is amazing."
43,Storks,10,15 October 2016,STORKS is probably the most poignant cartoon feature since UP . . .,". . . with even more gratuitous animal extras (such as, ""Wolfpack, form a Submarine!""). As one would expect from ANY Warner Bros. production, STORKS is chock full of warnings for America. (Warner warnings for upcoming U.S. 21st Century Calamities, Catastrophes, Cataclysms, and Apocalypti have pervaded most, if not all, their film products for about a century.) In STORKS, Warner's Warners first blow their whistle against Corrupt Corporate Capitalism, in the guise of boss stork Hunter's Cornerstone.com (an obvious allusion to Walmart and Amazon's on-going and highly ""successful"" campaign to destroy Small Town America and American Values, as they depopulate the rural U.S.). Next, Warner warns us that Corporate Greedheads also are sowing the seeds of destruction in the American Family by requiring ""workers"" to be EMPLOYEES FIRST (and family members on the side, if there's any time left over) by keeping them connected--or tethered--to ""work"" 24/7/365 (as is the case with young Nate's Mom and Dad, Henry and Sarah, who are rarely parents and seldom even spouses in their Home OFFICE environment). Finally, as futurists such as Aldous Huxley predicted as far back as the 1900s, Human Reproduction is on the verge of being fully automated during the First 100 Days after Jan. 20, 2017, since President Trump will not tolerate having any babies getting in the way of his roving tiny fingers."
44,Storks,10,5 December 2016,Why so underrated!? best animated movie 2016 and best animated movie in years,"I loved this movie. Is it almost flawless. The story is about a stork named junior who is about to get a promotion to be the new boss at the stork delivery factory. Storks used to deliver babies but now they ship everyday things and no babies. A human( no humans allowed otherwise) has lived there because another stork 18 years ago failed to deliver her and she is stuck there. So the stork junior gets a order from his boss to fire her (tulip). But junior can't fire her because he feels sorry for her so he ""hides"" her in the old babyfactory.Meanwhile a young boy has two parents who are 2 busy workers with a home company. They don't have any time for him he is alone and wish for a baby brother. In the addict he finds an old paper add from the stork company when they did delivered babies and write them a letter. Tulip gets the letter and accidentally put in the letter in the ""baby machine"" and a baby is made. So Junior and tulip need to deliver the baby ( a little girl) and deliver her to the family before juniors boss finds out after the weekend. Such a fun heart warming and great story. I loved the characters. Usually in movies in general there is some bad character .But i most say i didn't hate any in this cast. The voice actors was great. Andy sandberg plays junior, katie crown tulip , Kelsey grammar hunter( the boss) and key and peele is two hilarious wolf. Jennifer Aniston and Ty burrel does the voice for the parents. So great story great acting great humor. Its just work. Also very emotional movie and like i said heart warming. Cant believe it just broke even at the box office and the IMDb rating is at 7.0/10. In my eyes a lot better then zootopia and kubo and the two strings( haven't seen moana yet). A 10/10 movie and one of the best animated movie i have ever seen., and i most add one of the best movies this year."
45,Storks,10,12 November 2016,"Very cute and funny. Fast paced, but i think it works.","I thought this movie was hilarious, i saw it twice with multiple friends.I also recommended it to other people. Like i said, its fast paced but it works because that's what the comedy is going for. There's a user here who gave it 1 star and said there was an inappropriate scene at the end but i have no idea what they could be talking about? I think i know but you have to be outdated to think so but its definitely not inappropriate. So here's the spoiler of what it could be...SPOILERAt the end the babies are being delivered and the 3 minute scene could be the storks delivering the babies to all the different parents who wanted them (including) moms and dads, single moms, single dads, moms and moms, dads and dads. That's it. Big deal. It doesn't even shove it in your face. Its 2016. Grow up. And they're all happy that they got their baby. It flashes all the different parent types. Its not inappropriate. Don't impose your outdated personal beliefs on this perfect movie for everyone.I gave it 10 out of 10 because it made me laugh, i loved the animation and the characters.The story was great."
46,Storks,9,11 November 2016,"Exceeds Expectations, Entertaining for All Ages","Going into this I was expecting bad animation or a lagging/annoying story but to my surprise I was very entertained . I went with my 3 year old son and considering the last two movies we saw at the theater (which ill mention later) this one definitely blew them out of the water. The animation was very crisp, the story although somewhat predictable did not follow the VERY predictable format that I have seen in most other children movies. From the start the movie was unique and wasn't trying to be over the top funny. The main characters are very likable and stay true to their nature. There is something for everyone in this movie, for me personally it was the scene where Tulips character almost falls out of the plane and when the two are trying to get the baby to sleep which any parent can relate to. Sure it wasn't Toy Story but the animation was wonderful and the characters were solid and I really liked the main character Junior voiced by Adam Sandberg a person who I don't really like haha, I could of given it an 8 but I gave it extra pointage because I was genuinely locked into what was going to happen and as an adult that is impressive. Granted the last two movies I saw Life of Pets which i would give a 6 and The Good Dinosaur I would give a 1, this one actual got me a little teary eyed at the end and I didn't necessarily want to get up to refill my soda because I didn't want to miss anything. The only negative I would say is that there wasn't really a true back end story or fill story to this and that there wasn't any true closure to the movie or to the side story of the family involved, but there was definitely enough charm to look past that. To sound corny: it definitely delivered!"
47,Storks,9,6 April 2017,A heartwarming story about family values,I loved how the movie reflects family values. The problem of modern times is that we can fall into the trap of working for no purpose and all the time. This movie makes me appreciate the miracle of life. The wolves formation were really unbelievable but definitely entertaining :)
48,Storks,7,8 February 2017,Very Nice Movie :),"As simple as that.I just wanted to say that this movie kept me interested all the way through, had a really nice story, nice music, likable characters and voices.Time flew past when watching it, the 90 minutes felt like about 45 minutes, there was plenty of action, great animation plus the babies were sooo kyoot...blah at spelling it correctly. :pIt was a welcome return of entertainment from a animated movie after that annoying Trolls movie with it's bad and cheesy awful singing every few minutes.Would I want a sequel...nah...was so nice as it was...but then again I would watch the sequel. ;)I thought it was a nice little nod at Aliens movie too but it does not list it in connections with the giant yellow machine..no?...well I thought so...so there. :pAs for the Wolfpack lol, they stole the show. Now a spin off with them would be kewl...haha spell check is gonna moan at this pfttt to it. :D Wolfpack submarine ...ping ping ping ...hahaha...too funny.Overall it's a user friendly fun movie for all the family. :)"
49,Storks,6,12 October 2016,Slightly soaring,"This is my review of Storks (spoiler free) *** (3/5) MOST OF US in our lives as youngsters would have asked our parents the question of ""Where do babies come from?"" and they would look embarrassed and try to give a less graphic and more child friendly answer ""Babies come from storks in the clouds."" Storks is a computer-generated animation that brings that reality to life or as close to life as we as youngsters imagined it. Although in Storks it shows that delivering babies became a hassle but they always gave their word by their creative motto and try to deliver the babies as best they could, they now run an international cooperation donned by Kelsey Grammar's Hunter (who interestingly has the same sounding voice as The Simpsons' Sideshow Bob, without the English accent) that delivers other products by pods, those products will be computers or even something that may be a necessity.This was written from the mind of Nicholas Stoller who earlier this year gave us the clunky sequel to Bad Neighbours his story about the storks delivering other types of products is good at first filled with a few jokes that deliver a few laughs and that goes on throughout but as it gets to the half way point it seems like he ran out of ideas as he delivers one unfunny to another unfunny line. So as he tries to make an entertaining fit to The Lego Movie as shown with the enjoyable and quite funny Lego Ninjago short before the film starts. But instead it thrives on mediocrity and incessant, brainless writing that may entertain audiences under the ages of six essentially this isn't for every audience as the adults may get a headache. The pacing is relentless but again as it thrives on mediocrity it feels like this type of film has been done before. Familiarity is another point to settle as it has the same animation style as Illumination studios with their last attempt The Secret Life of Pets if it had wings mixed with a part of Pixar Animation like Toy Story if it had feathers although it's not nearly as clever or as ingenious as those two films, and delivers fewer laughs than Donald Trump's hair when he walks into a political debate.Filled with flaws from the start however all of which can be forgiven with wonderful voices behind Junior (Andy Sandberg, on his second best form this year) and Tulip (Katie Crown in only her second feature in nine years) or 'Orphan Tulip' as the storks call her. Tulip has a unique story she is a spirited and hyperactive 18 year old girl who has lived with the storks her entire life and she calls them family she doesn't know any other life, however the storks want her gone as Hunter shows Junior a very creative graph that profits go down when she tries to help, in that way it's a lot like Elf so Hunter tells Junior that he has to fire Tulip or take her to her family who have no idea she exists. He has to fire in order to become his lifelong dream to be boss of the company with quite a fun montage showing what will happen when he is boss.The best parts of the film are the beginning and the finale but in-between those parts is a rather messy flop journey with Junior and Tulip as they go on an adventure with the baby and they are overrun by many obstacles, including wolves with the leaders the Alpha and the Beta voiced by the brilliant Keegan Michael-Key and Jordan Peele who have a good time arguing with each other until they see the baby and they get very big-eyed and simply say ""awww,"" at the baby who has a rather florescent pink hairstyle unfortunately that joke is repeated it's funny the first time but that isn't the first joke that is repeated, it seems to go with that theme throughout. Through the second act there is also a pigeon named Toady (Stephen Kramer Glickman) who finds out what Junior is really doing by tasting a bit of baby powder that he left behind, and he goes into detective mode with the title credits of either Sherlock or Magnum P.I. and he goes to tell Hunter who turns into the villain and tries his best to catch Junior with a well thought out capture. From then on the story thrives on predictability still delivering a few laughs but not as many as before and still keeps the theme of repetitive jokes that are now lumbered and over-used. As we fly into the third act there are quite a few of funny scenes but that manage to shy away from flying hilarity, there is a rather funny fight scene with some baby protecting penguins and they try to be very quiet while the baby is sleeping, this scene is rather inventive and seems to be the funniest and the best scene.Despite all the large holes and silly brainless dialogue all of the flaws can be forgiven with great voices and original plot at the start but instead throughout runs out of ideas and soars mostly lumbered babies which look the same as if they were cloned and broken winged. Storks is okay but mostly an ambiguous mess.VERDICT: Occasionally soars at points, but mostly it's filled with large holes, repetitive jokes and brainless dialogue that fails to deliver a huge amount of hilarity, and instead is flying broken winged and delivering bouncing bundles of mediocrity.6/10 okay."
50,Storks,9,24 September 2016,"""Storks"" is everything most Movie Fans want from an animated family film.","""You had to be there!"" Have you ever said that while retelling a funny story which seems to be losing something in the explanation? Well, that's how I feel writing this review. There are so many moments in the animated family film ""Storks"" (PG, 1:29) that I want to explain examples of how entertaining this movie is, but I don't think mere words can do it justice. Consider the following: Birds often fly into glass, wolves travel and work together in packs and babies are irresistible. These ordinary-sounding facts become great sight gags in the hands of ""Storks"" directors Nicholas Stoller (who also wrote the script) and Doug Sweetland (in his feature film directorial debut). I could explain the scenes in question, but my descriptions would never be the same as being there and seeing all this play out yourself. You probably also know that penguins go to great lengths to protect their young, bored employees do strange things to entertain themselves at work and adults will do almost anything to make sure a sleeping baby stays asleep. (Funny stuff! Trust me!) Oh, and (of course) storks deliver human babies to their waiting families.Correction: Storks USED TO deliver babies. A stork honcho named Hunter (voiced by Kelsey Grammar) stopped the legendary practice eighteen years ago, deciding that there was more profit in having his feathered employees deliver packages. (Picture Amazon using drones with beaks.) Now, Hunter supervises the business CornerStore.com, and his best delivery stork is a hot young employee called Junior (Andy Samberg), who has just completed his one millionth delivery. Hunter is about to become president of the company and he plans to pass the responsibilities of the company's daily operations to Junior. This blows Junior's mind (which we see play out literally), but Hunter has one condition before he makes the promotion official. Junior has to fire Tulip (Katie Crown), the sole human who works there.Firing an employee whose hair-brained ideas create more problems than they solve seems a small price to pay to become the boss, but little in this movie comes easy for Junior  or goes according to plan. Tulip is a strange, but sweet young lady who became stranded on Stork Mountain when the address to which she was to be delivered was accidentally lost by a stork named Jasper (Danny Trejo). Tulip, the last baby made at the facility, was stuck living there and it's the only home she's ever known. Taking pity on her, instead of firing her, Junior puts Tulip in charge of the (unbeknownst to her) defunct mailroom. She's excited about her ""promotion"", but soon finds it necessary to keep herself entertained in the large empty room by talking to herself (actually, having conversations with herself, while adopting different personas) until one day that a letter actually shows up in the mailroom the old fashioned way! A young boy named Nate Gardner (Anton Starkman), whose workaholic real estate agent parents (Ty Burrell and Jennifer Aniston) practically ignore him, writes to the storks requesting a baby brother (""with mad ninja skills""). The conscientious Tulip, trying to figure out where she's supposed to take that letter, accidentally puts it in the dormant baby-making machine, which fires right up and creates a baby! In a panic, Junior sets out to deliver the infant before Hunter finds out what happened, but an injured wing forces him to depend on Tulip to help him complete his mission. On their journey, they start to bond with the little one, but that's just the beginning of the complications for this odd couple. They soon run afoul of a couple of wolves (Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele) who lead a very team-oriented, resourceful and persistent pack. A CornerStore.com employee, of the pigeon persuasion (Stephen Kramer Glickman), starts to figure out what is going on and threatens to ruin everything for Junior. (The character, Pigeon Toady, is written and performed to be annoying, and is so effective, he risks annoying the audience at times.) Meanwhile, Nate gets his parents to help him build a landing pad for the storks on their roof. It's a true bonding and emotionally rejuvenating experience for the Gardner family and Nate's parents can't bring themselves to tell him that storks don't even deliver babies anymore.""Storks"" is everything most Movie Fans want from an animated family film. It's original, clever, funny, adorable, wonderfully animated and voiced, and is likely to please kids as well as adults, no matter how long ago the stork delivered them. Actually, there's so much going on in this movie, some of it may be lost on younger kids, but there's nevertheless still plenty for them to enjoy. This movie rarely hits a sour note, but its appeal is hard to describe. You just gotta be there! ""A"""
51,Storks,7,24 September 2016,Saved by a Really Sweet Ending,"Although the humor is more than goofy and the animation isn't anything too special, Storks provides a well-strung emotional story about birds' history with delivering babies. That's more than impressive in and of itself.Nicholas Stoller is now on a bit of a role in my book as a director. I've enjoyed all of the films of his that I've seen, and Storks is a drastic change from his previous work. I mean was I wrong to think the directed of both Neighbors films would have a difficult time transitioning to a kids' film? Surprisingly, Storks is a well- directed adventure. The comedy doesn't always hit the way you'd want, but the third act certainly packs an unexpected emotional punch, and that was enough for me.One of my main issues with this film, and most non-Disney/Pixar films, is the tendency to make central characters over the top and distractingly goofy. Take the minions for example, they're hilarious side characters, but when they are the focus of the entire feature, the bits grow tiresome. The same sort of thing happens here, but with almost all of the main cast. The voice over cast do their best and make for some entertaining moments, but I would have liked some more simplicity and humane moments. Every character doesn't have to be fast talking, twitching rapidly, or bombastically animated.Luckily, the film's message and themes are sweet and heartwarming enough for me to get over some of the more ridiculous elements. Much like Dreamworks' 'Home' from last year, the film is made by the ending. Without the climax, it would just be another forgettable animated feature, but it actually turns out to be another entry in the line of great 2016 animated features.+Ending+Message-Too many over-the-top characters7.4/10"
52,Storks,5,25 September 2016,"Storks does fly comedically, it paces at an exhausting rate that needed to slow down in order to deliver","Childhood fables have a magical quality that is hard to replicate as adults. Those that want that fantasy escape usually find a Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings, where a lot of this seems more real then an Easter Bunny or a Tooth Fairy. The latter rarely need more detail then their claimed existence as young children (lets set the bar around under ten) are still processing what's real and what is left to their imagination. Of course one of life's mysteries they ponder on is where babies come from. Until their ready for the birds and the bee's talk, one classic way to explain is the stork.Most have probably heard about the legend of storks bringing newborn babies to their parents that want one (or like in Dumbo, are just given one no matter what). It's a cute idea, even though my parents had always told me how children are made (my family didn't believe hiding those hard facts). I could see how expanding that idea could lead to something larger, like a product out of Pixar. So let's see how Warner Brothers tries to explain storks and their mission inStorks.In this world, storks have been bringing children to parents forever (with clever art reflecting cavemen and ancient Egyptians), but when one child is accidentally forgotten with her route destroyed, it is decided that the birds need to change their business mindset. Cut to years later that the storks now deliver for an Amazon-like website called Cornerstone. It's being run by the ambitious, but ruthless Hunter (played by Kelsey Grammar) while the birds under him makes their delivery round. One such bird, Junior (played by Andy Samberg) is about to get his promotion under the condition that he immediately fires the forgotten child now an adult, Orphan Tulip (played by Katie Crown).Unable to do so, Junior instead makes Tulip the head of the mailing department which hasn't gotten a single letter in years. Meanwhile, a young boy Nate is board by his parents Henry (played by Ty Burrell) and Sarah (played by Jennifer Aniston)always working and asks for a sibling. When told by his parents no, he finds an old brochure for the storks and writes to them. Of course they get it and the letter is a accidentally processed, creating their first baby in a while. Junior and Tulip decide to deliver it themselves, knowing that getting caught would result in their ejection.Storks reminded me a lot of The Lego Movie, which was really fast paced and threw a lot of jokes while explaining it's complex story. This too is hyper, but maybe too hyper for it's own good. I laughed a lot while watching, but the first thirty minutes are exhausting at it seems to fast forward through it's buildup without giving the viewer much of a chance to rest and to let it rest. We do get those moments later, but this is a situation where I wished it had a longer running time to take more of it's time.The casting is the best thing about it. Andy Samberg and Kelsey Grammar add a lot of their over the top personalities to these characters which makes it more interesting when Samberg does go through a character development. Plus I'll give the filmmakers credit for NOT hiring an A-list star for Tulip, but a simple voice artist who is clearly given some recognition. The animation, though occasionally looking strange, is very nice to look at and does move at an appropriate fast speed. Again my major problem is that Storks seems to be so keen on moving fast, that it's own setup, though funny, often leaves a lot of other questions. If they've been delivering for eons, did they need another baby making machine or did God do it? Are storks people? If not why do they need money? How come the storks could have not found Tulip's address from their computer? You see what I mean?I'll give this five storks delivering babies out of ten. Kids will probably really like this, though parents might be questioning the complex world more then admiring it. If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, then you'll probably be laughing along with your child. I just wish the film had delivered more for me."
53,Storks,7,23 September 2016,Delivering Cuteness Wherever They Flock,"""Where do babies come from?"" For decades kids ask this question to parents and in a state of desperation creative answers, (aka lies) are cooked up. One popular story wielded by parents is the concept of the stork delivering babies to doorsteps. This weekend, the creative geniuses over in La La land have managed to craft an animated film all about the miracle of these white winged wonders. Yes, today I'm reviewing Storks starring Andy Samberg and Katie Crown. LIKES:  Originality  Cute  EmotionalWe all know there is really no original story anymore, but animated films usually put a creative twist on things. Storks breaks the mold of princesses and dogs by switching to birds with the fabled job of bringing lifeliterallyto people's doors. I enjoyed the poke at our online consumerism by making the storks trade babies for technology, which isn't the iconic adventure setting. Along the way, the orphaned Tulip (Crown) accidentally creates a baby through a giant magic wielding device that leads to a simplistic adventure to return her home. It's a fun twist on the tale of creatures uniting to accomplish a goal (Ice Age anyone), topped with a few unique kicks to sweeten the deal, including Lego versions of wolves. Stupid as all this may sound, Storks main attraction is the cuteness bundled in the 100 minute run time. I don't just mean the baby, although the magenta haired munchkin will certainly melt many aspiring/current parents' hearts. Much of my audience awed at some of the sweet moments our first time ""foster"" parents experience, many of which will bring nostalgic memories of your child's firsts rushing back. But if the main story isn't up your alley, the side tale of a family struggling to spend quality time might be the ticket for you, especially with that song track they play. Perhaps the biggest bang of Storks though, is the emotion the team have placed throughout the journey. A simple opening starts to soften the heart as the intentions of Tulip are shared, which no surprise is the preachy, noble, and justice filled goals all protagonists have. It's just an opening I promise. As they travel through the world, various themes of parenting and letting go fill the screen that again will start to knock the walls down further. Yet the ending is where the true punch is. Without ruining anything, Storks ending has a powerful, well animated, montage, complete with orchestrated sappy music, to open the flood gate of tears of most parents in the audience. Not me of course, I'm pretty much a robot, but there were loads of sniffles at the heartfelt moment portrayed. Sigh, such a nice wrap up of the movie, despite the predictability. DISLIKES  Predictable  Misdirected Comedy  Annoying at timesNo surprise, Storks has a predictable plot that most animated movies have and I'm being a stickler. I know this isn't a shock so it's why I'm saying it is a minor weakness. Despite the unique twist on the story, Storks originality does not extend much past that and falls into the time tested pattern once again. Oh sure, I was wrong on one prediction, but the trailers have given much of the little surprise away. Such a shame with the promise they made, but hey we at least got laughs out of it right? Right?Wrong! You might go into Storks thinking or hoping for kiddy laughs with a few clever puns thrown in the mix. This was not the case. Surprisingly, this movie's jokes are geared towards a more adult audience in terms of delivery, content, and comprehension. I don't mean sex jokes (this isn't Sausage Party), but much of Storks gears towards parenting humor and themes of abandonment that might be a little over your little ones' heads. Yes, there is some slapstick comedy, bodily harm, and a pigeon with a goofy voice named Pigeon Toady that will make them laugh. Aside from that, most of the comedy is a shot at entertaining parents, which I'm sorry to say failed for the most part in the laugh department. In fact, much of the comedy was actually annoying to me. First off they rely on constant banter for much of their dialogue. It was kind of entertaining at first, but they ran too far with it and by the fifth round of arguing it had gotten old and rather stupid. The wolves that seemed to be so funny in the trailers were indeed entertainingin the beginning. However, their comedic ploy also got annoying, particularly in the way they spoke in a very direct, robotic like manner. And as for Pigeon Toady, there were times I laughed hard, but this character gets old quickly, especially his gigolo like attitude that seemed like a diluted SNL character. I could go on, but I think three strikes is enough to make my point. The Verdict:If you found Storks' trailers cute, then the movie will only amplify that factor as you watch it. This simplistic film is fun for kids, but ironically seems to be geared towards parents for the true emotional kick. Unfortunately, the comedic aspect failed to take flight and stumbled into the stormy skies of annoyance and stupidity. Can't say it's the best animated feature to grace the silver screen, it is a decent distraction for a rainy day. My recommendation is to wait for a Redbox rent, except for parents wanting to recapture baby magic. My scores are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0"
54,Storks,,22 September 2016,Hard-edged story for a such a soft subject.,"""No! Just a brief exposure to baby cuteness can ruin your life!"" Junior (voice of Andy Samberg)Actually, Storks is not as cute as that quote, for part of it has a hard edge I find disconcerting for a kid-friendly animation. That storks no longer deliver babies in favor of a delivery contract service like Amazon's ambitious plans forms the conflict of the story whose resolution you could compose right now. The film is hard until the babies arrive, as is true in life itself.The conceit of their not delivering babies anymore still leaves kids without a clue about how the babies are born and delivered. The lack of an adequate explanation compounds the already difficult task parents have explaining the origins of babies anyway. For much of the film, the world is a bleak, sterile place where an orphan with soul, Tulip (voice of Katie Crown), is about to lose her job at Stork Mountain because of her accident-prone imagination.Hunter (voice of Kelsey Grammar), the head of the company, represents tycoons who are in business for the bucks, and he is out of the baby business to deliver inert packages. Junior hooks up with Tulip to deliver an unwanted baby, encountering various challenges on the way to the home, including an amusing pack of wolves (""I'm gonna devour this thing."" Then wolf licks baby, who coos).The story picks up and moves to warmth the closer the heroes get to delivering the babies. Perhaps I was turned off by the stork figures that have a beak tough to make varied or even likable.Important, too, is a married couple so mired in their work they ignore their loving boy, who orders a baby brother to love. The comment on the distracted parents is a poignant criticism of the overextended modern husband and wife."
55,Storks,4,27 February 2017,Good enough,"It's really sad that this animation didn't get enough credit as others. The reviews I've read about it, mostly by critics, were bad, mainly characterising it as a waste of time. And yet, after watching it, I can say for sure that it wasn't so bad. Yes, it's not Frozen or even Minions, but it's cute and has babies in it!! (come on! you can't go wrong with babies in a movie for children). The main story is clever: the storks have changed their baby business into a simple delivery network that has more profit. But then, an orphan who had never been delivered to her real family due to an accident, accidentally creates a baby for a family and she and her stork boss have to deliver the baby secretly so no one can find out. The film is quite funny and had some cute moments, even moving ones, with the parents who ignore their child, the stork who wants to get the big raise, even the wolf pack was funny (okay, that pigeon was creepy though!). Sure, it wasn't very original and the ending was predictable, but the movie is satisfying enough, so 4 out of 10."
56,Storks,10,28 December 2016,A diamond in the rough,"Let me start by saying that I don't this film is a 10/10 but hopefully my rating will add to its overall rating. Since the rise of cgi animated cinema there's been a influx of rubbish movies made for a quick buck. This isn't one of them. It's no Finding Nemo but it was a pleasant surprise. People who have rated it a 4 or 5 are being far too harsh. It doesn't feel overly forced, maybe in parts but that's the same in SOO much modern cinema and American sitcoms. My only criticism would be that we never really emotionally connect with the main characters but probably mostly with the female lead. But hey it's a kids film and you still connect with the main family so all is good."
57,Storks,9,12 December 2016,Cuteness level: infinite...,"This is one of these movies that even if you don't have kids, you will sit down and watch it yourself, either way. I really enjoyed the story line, which was pretty clever if you ask me. The whole story with babies and storks, although it may seem too old in the beginning, as the movie progresses you see that this new spin was really really interesting. The CGI was super, the characters were amazing and overall, the movie only gets better and better towards the end. Pigeon Toady was THE character for me, but other characters were also equally funny throughout the movie. Really enjoyed the wolf pack, all of them, as well as the way the reacted to the baby. Being a new parent myself, I really sympathized in more than one occasions with what was going on in the movie and laughed really hard."
58,Storks,7,30 September 2016,Delightfully stupid,"Very clearly, this movie did not aspire to the same level as of animated storytelling as Disney, half of Dreamworks, and what used to be Pixar. If you watched the trailer and thought this might be a serious contender for the Best Animated Feature Oscar, you're probably also too dumb to be reading this.Instead, Storks aspires to be just a goofy animated romp. And at that, it pretty well succeeds.A lot of the humor feels forced, that is true, but the movie is by no means predictable (at least not until the very end). We have no trouble identifying the villain and the conflict, but it does a good job keeping the audience guessing as to just where the frig the writers intended to go with this. So if nothing else, the kids won't be bored.It only falls short for me at the very end, and only because they picked a resolution that felt safe and generic as opposed to one with a lot of heart. The short version is that, after the characters really grow to trust and care for each other, they just splinter apart and go their separate ways at the very end.I would be willing to bet that the original script had a lot more heart, but that somebody somewhere felt it was too risqué having humans and birds call each other family and made a last-minute switch. This leaves us with a few characters that feel like fillers, eating time away from the ones we actually do like, and leaves viewers with a very unsatisfying resolution.So. . . I guess my advice would be to get the movie on home media and quit right after the epic climax, because, unsatisfying ending aside, it is a cute little story appropriate for all ages. If nothing else, this is worth watching if only to encourage a sequel."
59,Storks,7,21 October 2016,7/10,"Storks have always been delivering babies, but not in the last 18 years where they have moved to delivering packages with a remarkable success. Junior (Andy Sandberg) is about to be promoted as ""the Boss"", he just has one task to do before, that is firing Tulip (Katie Crown), an orphan girl who lives with the storks. Things go unexpectedly south and a baby is created, now Junior's goal is do deliver this baby before his boss knows anything about it or he will surely be fired.Being an adamant Nicholas Stoller fan, I was looking forward to this film from one of the best comedy directors of our times. ""Storks"" might lack the depth or the grit that we have had the pleasure to experience with many animated films of all kinds in recent years, yet it manages to overcome many of its issues with sheer sense of joy and fun, making for a constantly kinetic experience.The characters in this film aren't what really sticks out. Sure you start to feel something for the main central relationship and there are a couple of side characters that get to have a valid arch, but honestly there isn't really anything that's deeply moving or engaging about these characters, they have a very explicit arch and a very schematic development. At no point I was bothered by them, on the contrary many of them are quite enjoyable to have on screen, yet when it comes to giving emotional payoff or touching the audience's heart, ""Storks"" didn't exactly do it for me and it would have made for a slightly prodding film were it not for its energy.What makes this film worth the ticket of entrance is the incredible artisan-ship implemented in the comedic sketches. Scene after scene the number of jokes included just flies past you and even if the film looses steam its family story-line as soon as you're back in the comedy you just roll with it instantly. Stoller and his co-director Doung Sweetland just don'ìt give the audience the time to take it all in and throw at you the very best visual comedy there is in the animated industry right now.The brilliance in each joke was astounding and the frequency of such intelligent comedy was even more. The way the animators and the directors find a way to turn every single story beat into a hilarious gag is a pleasure to behold. The use of sound too is vital to the success of many jokes and it used sparingly in a way that doesn't become overbearing and on the nose as it is easy to become using sound as a comedic tool. These people know comedy and its workings deeply and they show their full wisdom in it with this filmmaking effort. Just brilliant visuals, I was radiating a wide-spread smile on my face at every cut, both because of the genuine laughter induced by these great jokes and both out of joy for the great exercise in craft of film and comedy.Stoller proves once again his great sensibilities in the comedy realm and whilst both emotionally and thematically the film was underwhelming, the amount of success the filmmakers accumulate with the comedy in this film is so high you still manage to be engaged at every scene."
60,Storks,8,30 September 2016,Loved the animation in this animated feature.,"One of the best 3D animated film I have seen in a long time. I'm no animator, but this movie seem more polished than anything I've seen in 3D animation in a long time. The character design was great.Pretty cool story about the storks getting out of the baby delivering biz and becoming regular delivery boys, when Tulip, the last baby they never got to delivered 18 years ago, messes up and creates a new baby that needs to be delivered to a family that's waiting for it, so a stork named Junior has to help him Tulip quickly and secretly deliver this baby before it threatens his no promotion.Overall, I did not know what to expect from the film, but it turned out to be a very impressive animated feature."
61,Storks,9,22 September 2016,Wonderful animation with humor in just the right places making this great movie.,"Went into this movie today expecting it to be like any other animated movie this year with bland crude jokes and weak plot...ehmmm angry birds/secret life of pets. Anyways walked out super thrilled as this was much more than your average talking animal story.If the trailer even looks ""half-decent"" to you than this is your type of movie and you will LOVE it. I went into this after watching their last trailers for this, which made me feel like this would be a drag plot with some weak humor but was surprised on just how clever this movie was. I don't want to spoil anything but based on the trailer the Piegon looked annoying and likely to spit off crude humor jokes. However, this was not the case even for a minor character like this he pulled off some of the best jokes in one scene in particular. Another thing to note is the animation is so top notch you will be laughing just watching how amazingly crafted it was. My favorite part of this movie has to be the main characters Orphan Tulip and Junior because of how well done the jokes were used by them that added to the plot. I was surprised the jokes were made without needing any commonly used crude humor which is the go to nowadays. The only part that could of been removed from the movie is the jokes with the wolves but even then they added quite a funny scene that had the audience laughing. Anyways, if you are looking for a movie and like to watch animation this is DEFINITELY one you want to see. Overall, this movie has just the right amount of comedy while maintaining a good plot and ends leaving you happy with a strong theme of the importance of family."
62,Storks,6,25 September 2016,An okay WB delivery,"Compared to other films of 2016, Storks is a flick that I elicited a viewing of merely out of curiosity. When I saw Zootopia back in March, one of the previews that came prior to my showing was for Storks, and it was assuaging in stark contrast to the other trailers. I almost instantaneously noticed the decadent quantity of ideas Storks offered when I viewed it, and for many of them (metamorphosing wolf packs, storks delivering packages, and quiet fight against penguins), their execution was anything but lurid. Despondently, that is the principle prerogative of the plot of Storks, as the writing leaves much to be desired and the conflicts between Junior and Tulip are perplex even though they do add to the complexity of their relationship, a pleasantly surprising aspect of a more cartoony animated film. Speaking of those two, the characters are bewilderingly polarized, from indisputable highlights (the wolf pack) to bland as the most generic cartoon characters (I found Pigeon Toady to be like this). The animation is the saving grace, delivering some of the better looking examples of cartoony animation with its ability to give good expressions and acting in a coalition with the ideas and the way the characters act to give us an animated movie that knows that it is an extended cartoon and doesn't cast vital elements of a true movie into the umbrage. Storks would simulate a desirable diversion for young children watching with grandparents who remember watching the various Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts of pre-1969, but for other audiences, it would be up to your own choice. At least we know, though, that Warner Bros. knows what to do with animated Legos."
63,Storks,7,24 September 2017,You're Fired!,"Storks no longer deliver babies. They have a large warehouse not named Amazon, where they deliver packages and hopefully life won't imitate art. Tulip, is a undelivered human who works there and messes things up. Her most recent error is to process a baby delivery which involves a long perilous formula trek.The theme once again is family and friends, give up that electronic device to bond with your kid(s). The kids seemed to like the film, while I had a hard time getting into the characters, finding Tulip's situation sad as were her cute antics as in talking to herself. The film had some funny moments, mostly for the kids."
64,Storks,7,19 August 2017,Unexpectedly fun,"This film does not try to hard with the humour which makes it all the more endearing. The dialogue is good, and the pace keeps up the adventurous journey.The voice-overs are all done so well. I am glad I came across this perhaps underrated fun movie."
65,Storks,10,10 June 2017,See this movie only if you want to laugh......a lot........,"Storks is one of my all-time top 10 favorite movies ever. The story line is compelling, the humor is belly-laugh outrageous, and the creativity is superb. What's disappointing is that it isn't more popular, because when I saw it, I was sure ""wolf pack, form (insert random noun here)"" would become part of our cultural vernacular. The pigeon scene (how do you like me now?!) was snort-milk-out-your-nose funny. The brilliance of the writing is that instead of relying on tired, over-used 'bad guy' scenes to move plot ahead, even the what-you-think-will-turn-into-scary-scenes have a way of turning on a dime and becoming screamingly funny."
66,Storks,5,10 May 2017,cute but boring,"Storks have always delivered babies from their Stork Mountain. It was a sacred duty until 18 years ago when Jasper tried to raise orphan Tulip after a botched delivery. Leader Hunter (Kelsey Grammar) stopped delivering babies and started delivering packages. The storks are now delivering for Cornerstore.com. Hunter promises Junior (Andy Samberg) to be the future boss if he fires Tulip who is a constant headache. Junior takes pity and keeps Tulip in the abandoned part of the facility to head up the non-existent letters department. Nate Gardner wants to have a baby sibling. He writes a letter to the storks which generates a baby from the Baby Making Machine. Junior is injured and must join Tulip in flying an old flying machine to deliver the adorable baby.The setup and the story is too complicated for this simple animated movie. The characters are suitably cute and lovely. It lacks a compelling villain and the plot rambles around. Ultimately, it's a brightly-colored but boring adventure. The character construction is solid but the writing needs help. Kids may like some of the wacky colorful fun but it's not much more than that."
67,Storks,10,8 May 2017,a good adventure in delivering a baby,"This is another bird's animated movie after 'Angry bird'. This story is about a boy who wishes to have a baby brother. After receiving the message, a girl and a stork struggles to deliver the baby to the boy. This is my favorite birds movie. If you are movie fan of 'Angry bird' I suggest not to miss this movie."
68,Storks,5,14 April 2017,Cheesy but not bad,"I had no idea what to expect of this movie before I watched it, but I enjoyed it, although part of it are seriously weird. The conflict is that a whole bunch of storks run a business and their job does not happen to be delivering babies. However, a red-head girl accidentally makes a baby with a machine, and she and a stork named Junior have to deliver it in secret; the business owner must not know. Along the way, they meet wolves. There is a certain boy that ordered the baby because he is a single kid and wants more family time.As for the humor, a lot of it was cheesy. The humor was for kids six and under, yet most say the plot is for kids six and over, which means it has a small age range. However, the whole family enjoyed what the wolves did. Everyone would burst into laughter and want more. What the business owner did to show the income was pretty funny.The wrong actors were selected. The characters talked too fast, mostly the main two characters, which was annoying. There were no characters singing, but when the characters weren't talking, there were a couple of songs, and they were horrible.At the end, storks are delivering babies again. It shows a bunch of parents happily receiving their new children. Two of the pairs are homosexual, one of two dads, and the other of two moms. You see them only for a split second. I won't say where I stand.I wish it was less cheesy and that the actors had talked a little slower, but it was otherwise mostly good (again, weird plot). Not the sort of movie worth watching in the theater. That would be a waste of money. Perfect movie, though, if you want to watch something with your kids on the weekend."
69,Storks,7,6 January 2017,Hopefully the Warner Animation Group keeps this up.,"'STORKS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The new computer-animated comedy from Warner Animation Group; which had it's first big hit in several years, with 2014's 'THE LEGO MOVIE'. 'STORKS' tells the story of a world where storks once delivered babies to expecting parents, but now the business has been turned into a parcel delivering service instead (because it's more profitable). When a new baby is accidentally produced, the lead delivery stork, and an adult human orphan (who was accidentally never delivered as a child), set out to make sure the new baby reaches it's destination. The film was directed by Nicholas Stoller and Doug Sweetland (in his feature directorial debut), and it was written by Stoller (who's also helmed such hit comedies as 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL', 'GET HIM TO THE Greek', 'NEIGHBORS' and 'NEIGHBORS 2: SORRORITY ROW'; as well as co-written such hit kids' movies as 'THE MUPPETS', 'MUPPETS MOST WANTED' and 'GULLIVER'S TRAVELS'). It stars the voice talents of Andy Samberg, Katie Crown, Kelsey Grammar, Jennifer Aniston, Ty Burrell, Anton Starkman, Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele and Danny Trejo. The film was a hit at the Box Office (although it didn't do nearly as well as 'THE LEGO MOVIE'), and it's gotten mostly good reviews from critics. I watched it with my nephews, and their father, and we all had a good time.Years ago, storks used to deliver babies to their parents; from a baby producing business at Stork Mountain. Then the company's CEO, a stork named Hunter (Grammer), decided there was more money to be made delivering parcels. Before the business stopped delivering babies though, a baby girl named Tulip was accidentally not delivered to her parents. So the storks raised her, and employed her at their new company (now called Cornerstone). When Tulip turns 18 though (now voiced by Crown), she becomes a nuisance to the business; and Hunter tells his top employee, Junior (Samberg), to fire her. Junior doesn't have the courage to do it though, and when a new baby is ordered, and accidentally produced by the two of them, the duo teams up to deliver it.The movie is beautifully animated, and pretty funny (at times). It's even slightly touching, at the end, but it never gets too serious. The cast is all great in their roles, and I think Stoller definitely has talent in writing/directing kids' movies. It's a little weird, given that his adult comedy films are so vulgar and raunchy (and I love them that way). The film is definitely not in the same league as 'THE LEGO MOVIE', but it's also definitely better than most animated kids' movies these days. Hopefully Warner Animation Group keeps this up.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc"
70,Storks,7,30 December 2016,Better than Expected and funny,"In midst of animated giants like Zootopia , Moana , Kubo and two string , Finding Dory,Sausage Party and some simple ones like Secret life of pets , Sing and Trolls I expected only worse from storks but it delivered well beyond my expectations. Being a kids movie there is not much to expect from the plot , themes or characters and the same goes with this also but within 1 and half hour it made me laugh and was quite enjoyable and entertaining but not remembrance possible for this. Highly clichéd , talking animals , same story, same characters but it does come better than others at points of its comic timing and usage of everyday topics to give you some new laughs for which this movie is actually much better than some of those who earned very high on box office. Well its a simple movie to enjoy nothing further here."
71,Storks,10,19 December 2016,Funny-Entertaining-FULL OF ADVENTURE!,"I REALLY Liked the trailer and the Movie was really good too!It was Funny and sad ( at some places ) and Entertaining.And I simply LOVED the animation..If you want to see a funny and heart-warming film, then Storks is a GREAT option for you.Th Character that was REALLY Annoying was Pigeon Toady! and you will see why... :PFrom great and funny animations, characters, to the facial expressions of the characters etc. the movie was NOT boring at all!the creativity in this film is brilliant and the animation is GREAT.I enjoyed the film from Start TO Finish!YOU SHOULD *DEFINITELY* WATCH THIS.10/10"
72,Storks,7,14 December 2016,To realise their actual line of work.,"I usually anticipate the animation films, but I was not interested in this. I saw it mainly because of how much I liked 'The Lego Movie'. This is not as good as that one, but cute little adorable animation. The film is exclusively for the kids and the families, but anybody can have a good time if they are not expecting according to their age, gender and other things. So if you are yet to watch, leave behind those in order to enjoy it.It is nothing to do with the 2009 short film 'Partly Cloudy'. But those who wanted a feature film on the similar theme would enjoy it. It is a little different though. The storks who switched their business to another, 18 years later a chain of events makes them realise what they should be doing. So in an adventure, soon to be the boss, a bird named Junior struggles to fix his mistake. In the process, he unleashes some secrets which brings the final act where the narration decides which way to end.Not a bad story, which is a road adventure like many animation films. The comedies were good and the characters are well developed in the short span. Some parts seem very silly, but enjoyable. Particularly the wolf-pack and their weird approach to deal with things. The animation too was very smooth and overall film was short, so swiftly narrated tale. This is not the year's best animation, though watching it for entertainment would work. Animation fans should not miss it, and must see for little children.7/10"
73,Storks,7,9 December 2016,Fun stuff..,"To me, this is the best and most entertaining animated feature film since Despicable Me.One simple reason: it's funny, at times even hilarious. The characters are wacky. Sandberg's voice also adds wackiness to the main character. This movie doesn't only make the kids laugh, which is great.When you want to watch animation features, those are the ingredients you should be looking for. Mindless fun, not too much on the nose. No singing (Disney)! Songs ruin the animated experience, in my opinion. When I looked up the directors, I understood, why this film was so funny and entertaining. One previously did a great job on many animated films and shorts, and the other made a few decent comedies. Both were very much qualified. Each year the studios release animated features because they're sure moneymakers. Parents take their children to the cinema. When an animated feature comes out, it runs longer than most live features. I know. I used to work at a big cinema. Studios (producers, directors) often forget to combine animation with a good script, a problem roughly 3 out of 4 films in this genre tend to have. I get it. The visual (and music) entices, captivates a child's (or viewer's) mind. From my point of view, unpredictably comical dialogue is also something this kind of film needs. Very entertaining 7.0"
74,Storks,7,25 October 2016,Storks Slightly Soars,"For a film studio like Warner Bros who until The Lego Movie was released two years ago was pretty much defunct in the animated movie making business, it would appear making a pretty good go at their animated output.Now yes The Lego Movie was a huge critical and financial success and deservedly so and although Storks is certainly not anywhere near that level of quality I still came out from watching it thinking it was a pretty decent effort and shows promise for their future projects.Storks without a doubt does rely upon a couple of predictable arcs and tropes familiar to the regular film watcher, parts of its kookiness so to speak reminded me of Shrek and the whole angle of 'we've got to get this baby back to its parents' story arc has been played out so many times beyond my initial Ice Age comparison as did the seemingly so different characters having to come together for a common goal, pretty standard kids animation fair.So what is it that makes it stand above other animations of its kind that have been released this year? Well I'll begin with Andy Samberg who as one of the lead characters manages to impose himself comedically on the film, many films have prominent comedians in central roles but rarely give them ample opportunity to have a voice on proceedings, The Secret Life of Pets is a prime example of this as why hire Louis C.K to be one of your leads if he's given almost no comedic voice (no pun intended), it's always a difficult decision no doubt but Samberg manages to attain some of that awkward confident charm that has made him so entertaining on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Kelsey Grammar is on some decently entertaining form as Samberg's boss with many of his exchanges with Samberg being some of the funniest moments (from my point of view) in the film, there's also entertaining material from comedy duo Key and Peele who feature as a pair of wolves and again this feels like they've had input into the script, so actually overall I think the voice cast was pretty bang on the money.Yes there are quite a few positives but some times you do have to work hard to get them, what I mean by that is that some of the humour is so bizarre and offbeat that there could be something you find hilarious but easily doesn't connect with a single other audience member and that is a problem, so therefore there certainly is a scattergun approach to the films humour, also there are periods in the film where it does feel like it is going through the motions in order to get to the next part of the story without having to rush to it.I do on a side note have to pay comment to a fight scene between our two leads and a bunch of penguins that has to be done in silence as to not wake a baby, its was truly brilliantly done, even to the point that I felt guilty actually laughing out loud during this silent battle so I muffled my laughs, now that is some effective stuff.So Storks is very much a notch above the likes of say The Secret Life of Pets and certainly The Angry Birds Movie but no way near anything like the quality of say Finding Dory, Zootropolis or Kubo and the Two Strings.Storks it certainly good natured family fun that if you're in right mood could surprise you with some of it's offbeat humour."
75,Storks,7,15 October 2016,"Messy, but enjoyable with a strong emotional core","'Storks' will never be up there with the greatest animated films, which have more focused plots, humour of more consistent quality balanced with great emotional power and for some a dark and daring element. However, 'Storks' is also a long way from being one of the worst.The biggest problem with 'Storks' is the story. It definitely has its moments, but things do get over-complicated and chaotic, predictability is high in the second act and the pacing is erratic with a couple of parts lacking momentum and some so hyperactive that you don't have much time to process before having to keep up again.While most of 'Storks' is incredibly entertaining, the laughs are not consistent, some of them in the second act being repetitive and laboured, a couple also try too hard and feel forced as a result. One character doesn't come off very well, and that's Pidgeon Toady, who is meant to be funny but is far too over-the-top and annoying.However, the visuals are spectacularly beautiful. The colours are incredibly rich, the backgrounds are rich in imagination and detail and the characters are all modelled well. The soundtrack is infectious and upbeat but also dynamic and with some tender understated pathos at the end. The dialogue is on the silly side but there are some amusingly witty moments. The sight gags are much more memorable, with the multi-tasking wolf pack being an absolute hoot and the silent penguin fight being every bit as hilarious.For 'Storks' to work, the relationship between the central characters has to come off well. Luckily, Junior and Tulip's chemistry is both fun and heartfelt and dealt with in a sympathetic way. So it was easy to root for them, particularly Tulip who is essentially the heart of the film. The babies are simply adorable, and the last act more than makes up for the predictable and fragmented (in execution of the humour) middle act. The climax is exciting and the ending is incredibly touching. What 'Storks' also does very well is how much it has to say on family life and the execution of its message never feels forced or over-didactic.Voice acting is very good on the whole, especially Andy Samberg, Katie Crown and Danny Trejo. Kelsey Grammar also does a very good job, suave and articulate-sounding as ever, if a somewhat predictable casting choice, think a less mid-Atlantic Sideshow Bob and you know what to expect. The only exception is Stephen Kramer Glickman who overdoes it dreadfully as Toady.On the whole, messy but enjoyable with a strong emotional core. It is a bright and breezy diversion, with some inspired humorous moments and a genuinely touching ending, but kids and adults alike will find trying to keep up with, or completely understanding, the plot a bit of an endeavour. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
76,Storks,6,2 October 2016,Awkward at First but Eventually Delivers,"Storks is a good-natured kids movie about the importance in peoples' lives of having a solid family. Storks starts off with a somewhat disconcerting notion--the world's storks have stopped delivering babies and instead work delivering products for Cornerstore.com. The head of the corporation, a blowhard stork named Hunter, is looking to take corporate gains to new heights, and tells Junior his assistant, that the boss job can be his if he releases (fires) Tulip, a human living with the stork since her infancy. Junior knows that Tulip would be devastated and cannot do this, and instead buries her in the mail room where she can't get into trouble. Except that when she receives a letter from a lonely boy looking for a younger brother, she fouls things up by making a baby and is determined to deliver it.If you think the plot is goofy, well, you are correct. However, this is definitely meant to be light-hearted stuff, so don't worry. Most of the movie turns out to be a mad-cap romp of Junior and Tulip trying to deliver the baby, with a side plot of Tulip looking for her real parents as well. The movie has a serious side in the notion that many of the characters are looking for a sense of belonging-- Tulip is looking for her parents, a young boy looking for a connection to his parents and a sibling to play with, Junior looking for acceptance in his job, etc.This movie would be really good if not for the interaction between Tulip and Junior--at the beginning of the movie, their personalities are a little too forced, and are not really as charming as they need to be. As the movie proceeds, however, the laughs seem more natural and their characters seem more genuine, and the movie hits its stride. There is a lot to admire here, as a lot of lonely characters struggle to find the fulfillment that their life is destined for."
77,Storks,10,29 September 2016,Booming Baby Bee Bopping Blast,"Fun. Fun. Fun. *** Took the whole family. Gram, daughter, Down's bro, and me. We all enjoyed it and laughed through the whole flick. Agree with the other reviewers: The beginning is a bit pushed, but we soon find out that the writers and story board artists are laying some tracks. Come on folks, they have to push a bit - otherwise they wind up spending 12 minutes on setup (think The Hobbit), or a whole movie (think Tarzan) and never get on with it. Once they've got their tracks laid, we're on our way. The material is not entirely original - but then what is? It's a long way from repetitive. Animation: Totally childishly fun. It's ice cream. Voice acting: Perfect casting. All characters on point. Unlike 'Secret Life of Pets' no character is 'forced.' Crazy wolves could have gone terribly wrong, but hey, they were great. Plot: The trailer gives the basics. Storks don't deliver babies anymore, but they deliver packages. Trigger Warning: Babies are good. Corrupting the core mission of baby deliver is wrong. Our hero 'Junior' fixes it. He has to give up his hopes and dreams and his career and defy the boss, but ... he does what we all know is right. Ooooops. I am so sorry... Not. I'd see this flick a million times just for that. A few prudes might worry about 'pagan' storks: Nonsense. The storks are generic angels dressed in avian clothing for kids.Be warned this is a really feel good movie: Family people might go home and make babies. Go. Take everyone. Have a good time."
78,Storks,9,27 September 2016,Warner Brothers animation children's animated film with G rating,"This is a surprisingly good movie and well paced. In a packed theatre it kept parents and kids captivated to the end. I had low expectations and had not been spoiled by the trailers and was pleasantly surprised at the pace of the humour and timing of the voice actors who played their roles well enough that their identities in some cases (excluding Sandberg )were not obvious until the final credits. The voice actors are superb and well cast .The 3D was not exploited but added to the depth of visuals in a subtle way and was probably not necessary. The film is a true animated film ,an often silly and witty romp with typical visuals only possible in this genre and a good throw back to the fun of classic looney-tunes cartoons . This is the best animated picture yet from WB animation that I have seen. This is a feel good little fantasy romp that I would highly recommend parents take their kids to. In my view, a sleeper hit that sets the bar high for future productions"
79,Storks,10,25 September 2016,Funny and refreshing!,"I think it wouldn't be fair to judge this movie outside of it's genre, and it's genre is a animated family movie. The plot is predictable, but so what? I really didn't watch this movie expecting complicated plot twists or drama.I really had fun watching this movie and it got me howling with laughter, and so did everyone else in the cinema. The delivery of jokes are done smartly and was nailed perfectly by the voice acting of the actors and actresses. I can't say if the kids get all the jokes because some of them are targeted more for the parents, but I think that's where the slapstick came in because they can be enjoyed by all ages. They don't have to get all the jokes, just enough to keep them entertained. I think the kids enjoyed it because they were laughing at all the right places. Some of the jokes are really over the top, but that works for me. It has it's heartwarming moments, and the message about the importance of family is loud and clear. It also has a message about how all families are different, but all families are important. Overall I love it and I would probably see it again when I have a chance."
