0,The Wind Rises,9,18 September 2013,The Most different Miyazaki's Film,"This film is totally different from Miyazaki's other films and I personally think, like what he's mentioned, a message to to world about how he looks at the war, war machines , peace, love and living. As I am a Taiwanese, who has once colonized and ruled by Japanese during the second world war, how Japanese coped with the war topic is always sensitive. However, what I saw in this film is truly reflecting that Miyazaki is peace loving and his point of view on war, life and love. He depicted about the beauty of dreams and surviving. You can see that everyone in this film try every hard to live, even though the time is hard and forced to strike a balance between dreams and reality. However, they are self fulfilling. So who is to blame? who ruined their lives and dreams? Those who leads them to the war to blame.In short, the film perfectly shows how the director's been telling in almost every his masterpiece but in a personally way, to the audience. Just like a final message he would like yo transmit to the world. I felt overwhelmed by the film and sad that he decided to retired. Please go to watch this film and you will do feel the courage to live hard and live well."
1,The Wind Rises,10,28 July 2013,Miyazaki's most mature film?,"The announcement of this film was a pleasant surprise after Ponyo and From Up on Poppy Hill, which both had simple, childish plots. Few films in Japan have tackled the lives of imperial period heroes; the ghosts of the 1960s urge people to denounce what really happened in that time and memorialize an imaginary anti-war movement, for example in this year's film ""Shounen H"". For Miyazaki to choose a subject like this showed that he was really going for a huge challenge. Miyazaki is of course anti-war and environmentalist. But Ghibli films are never negative. What sort of positive image of the Zero bomber inventor would Miyazaki produce?The result is astounding. As everyone has noted, this is not a children's movie. It's complex, so it doesn't have the epic sense of Miyazaki at his best, but history and adulthood are just as complex, and Miyazaki does justice to both. The film indeed stays positive throughout, by showing from start to finish how everyone wishes they themselves would behave, rewarding the viewer with virtue and beauty, but without being condescending about the hardships of real life. In a sense, the film is about the ""importance of dreams"", but it's also about what it means to be a dreamer in real life, and how our highest fantasies can be turned into beauty if we put our minds to it. The cartoon medium is put to full, extravagant use in dream sequences that merge right into the narrative. Certain elements at the end of the film leave the obvious unsaid in a peculiarly Japanese and fulfilling way. The most classic films of Japan, like the great works of Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu, say something profound about the meaning of life, and Kaze Tachinu deserves a place among those ranks."
2,The Wind Rises,,20 February 2014,A must see for animation fans! Stunningly beautiful.,"This is a breathtaking masterpiece of art that allows your mind and heart to soar like the wind .The story is loosely based on the real life story of Jiro Horikoshi (Joseph Gordon- Levitt). He dreams of flying but, because he's nearsighted, decides to be a Japanese airplane designer. We observe his life from child to adulthood as he makes his dream plane and, in the process, falls in love with Naoko (Emily Blunt). Will Jiro create the beautiful plane or realize that the beauty he's seeking is right in front of him all along? The film is a work of art. Hayao Miyazaki (Director and Writer) creates unique color palettes and designs. Since the movie takes place in the sky, the animators go above and beyond to hand draw backgrounds and movements for the planes. We witness them majestically soaring through the skies and you feel as if you're with them. The voice acting is well done. I think they portrayed the characters and their relationships exceptionally well. Much of the film focuses on the romance between Naoko and Jiro. Their connection is both loving and tragic. The film was first released in Japan, so American voice-overs are dubbed over the animation and yes, it can be distracting. They confront actual events that happened in Japan, such as the Kanto earth-quake of 1923 and Japan entering the war. I love the truth in this film. It doesn't shy away from talking about the real issues that happened during this time.My favorite character is Mr.Caproni (Stanley Tucci) a historical Italian aircraft designer who is Jiro's mentor in his dreams. I enjoy Stanley's voice acting skills. He's one of those character actors who is fantastic at everything he does. The character himself is fascinating. He looks at aircraft not as a bringer of war, but a creator of dreams. My favorite scene is the last dream sequence, after Jiro goes through a life changing experience. This is one of those bitter sweet endings, where you don't know what to think at first. You just need to take it all in.The message in this film is, ""Sometimes the outcome to your dream is not always what you expect."" Jiro spends his whole life wanting to make his aircraft, determined to do anything to fulfill his goal. After a few sacrifices, he realizes his potential but it's not what he expects. Mr. Caproni then asks him, ""Did you have a good ten years?""I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11 to 18-year-olds. This film shows people smoking and deals with serious issues of the time. This is a must see film! Reviewed by Keefer B, KIDS FIRST Film Critic. For more youth reviews go to kidsfirst.org."
3,The Wind Rises,10,1 March 2014,Miyazaki's swan song doesn't disappoint,"I don't know if I loved it right from minute one, but then it doesn't quite start like any Miyazaki film (well, even with a dream scene). Its a little quieter, more natural, thoughtful and subdued, much like the main character will be through the film. And then earthquake hits. Its unlike anything you've seen in an animated film. It doesn't hype up its suspense or action. it simply shows Its protagonist, Jiro, react to a situation as calm and controlled as possible amid the debris and darkness and chaos, and help a couple of people in need. of course he doesn't know this young woman he saves will be an emotional foundation for his life. But as with any simple but splendid poetry we have a sense of the connection made.Any other director might just make it a film about the 1920s earthquake that devastated Tokyo. Not Miyazaki. Soon after Tokyo is up and running and Jiro is after his passion which is airplanes. He dreams about them, and more than that dreams about the Italian icon of flying he looks up to as he gives Jiro advice and philosophical points about flying, inspiration and technology. And very soon after the film is more than anything about this man and his process - finding without any grandiose strokes what can make a plane fly quicker, faster, safer, with more agility and s look like no other. And, sometime soon, finding a love all his own.Miyazaki has said (once again but probably for real this time) that he is done making films with the conclusion of the Wind Rises. If so, that's fine. I'm not sure if it's any sort of culmination of what his career has been or what he's said - Though you could certainly have a double feature with Porco Rosso, also about the wonder of flight but more in an adventure fantasy approach and have a fantastic several hours - and yet it's no less a marvel than anything else he's made. And if anything it just reveals more depths to how he feels for people and can show them in dimensions on screen than ever before. It is a biopic still, and a line here or there may be cornball, but so what. Its a fiercely intelligent film with genuine sentiment and a grace that comes from being a master letting your story unfold without rushing, letting scenes play out for full emotional weight, And ample colors and compositions painted with nostalgia for a mood (if not necessarily a side in history).And yet you may think going in that there will be some sort of agenda politically speaking as it looks at a man who helped, ultimately, design planes that dropped bombs and shot and killed the US during world war two. It really isn't, or as simple as that. A couple of scenes with a German businessman of a sort voiced by Werner Herzog (yes the one and only, you'll know him when you hear him) lays out the futility in war and conflicts. And Jiro agrees. when someone speaks to him about what planes will be sent to fight whom, he is already resigned. ""Japan will burn,' he says more or less. And yet he always stays more pragmatic, more about the work and the hard enough task to make the planes and make them fly high and well. This double edged sword also comes out when he is talking to his Italian guru in his dreams (especially the last one at the end of the war).With all of this, the Wind Rises is a touching love story that seems possibly very doomed from the start - before getting engaged Jiro is told by Nahoko she has Tuberculosis and he doesn't care, or at least about that deterring him away - and how strong their bond is. How often do we get to see people in a movie, animated or otherwise, act like this to one another with kindness and compassion and a tenderness that (for the most part, maybe there's a bit of that ""Japanese Disney"" schmaltz but not much) is without any reservation? Not often really, at least like this as told at times without words at all; the high point of the picture is when there is a kind of wordless courtship as Jiro flies a paper plane around and it goes to the girl and she flies it back out as he chase to catch it and it repeats. The moving music, the amiable tone of the whole set piece, the mild peril... I'm at a loss to how much that just works because it feels true.Did I mention its among the ten most beautifully animated films ever made? And I'm sure that group includes Mononoke and Totoro already. And I know full well a term like 'beautiful"" is overused and tired. But Miyazaki crafts his works (or did) by hand with gorgeous, clear lines, water colors and maybe some cgi, and it both serves the story and its own sense of the world it's in: the earthy greens, the shiny clouds and blue skies, the metallic force of the planes, the drab grays of the offices and plane hangers. And yet you are still wrapped up in the tale of this man and those who cared about him or were inspired by and led by him, and is another rarity (easier to pull off in literature, trickier here and Miyzaki just about pulls it off): a mild wind that grows with power and energy, briefly, and then ebbs and flows with reality and, again, thought."
4,The Wind Rises,10,9 November 2013,Hayao Miyazaki's Most Beautiful Film,The Wind Rises is a fictionalized biography / character study of Jiro Hirikoshi and his story of becoming an Aviation Engineer. This movie had a great impact on me after seeing it in the theatre and I thought about what I had seen for the one hour drive home afterwards. In terms of pacing and how the movie focuses on the main character I was reminded of David Lean movies in its maturity and emotional grit. There were also times when watching that I thought to myself I have never seen hand drawn animation this good ever and will probably never see animation this good ever again. The character designs are beautiful. The backgrounds and color pallete are beautiful. The animation is breathtaking. But the story is just as beautiful as the artwork. The movie is about one mans journey to make beautiful airplanes but is also equally tragic in later scenes of the movie in the evolving love story and especially the last scene in the movie.This movie does not explain at any time through dialogue what the character is feeling but instead it shows you and the subtle and at times powerful emotions which are the glue of what holds his story together. Some people may wonder why Miyazaki took creative risks with the real life story of Jiro Hirikoshi. The real life Jiro never married to a woman with Tuberculosis. Did he really fantasize about building airplanes? Was he really followed by a Soviet Spy? I think the way the character fantasizes about airplanes even when not dreaming is an honest depiction of how creative people like Hayao Miyazaki think.Along with Porco Rosso this is probably Hayao Miyazaki's most personal movie. If you study Hayao Miyazaki's movies and read about his career like I have it becomes obvious that this movie is as much about Jiro Hirikoshi as it is about Hayao Miyazaki.I recommend anyone who has ever been creative to go see the Wind Rises.Hayao Miyazaki's Most Beautiful film.
5,The Wind Rises,10,13 March 2014,Film Authority on The Wind Rises,"Aviation has always been a key element of the Studio Ghibli films; from the flying broomstick in Kiki's Delivery Service to the airborne armies in Howl's Moving Castle. So for Hayao Miyazaki's reported swan-song to focus on the development of aeroplane design is no surprise. A fictionalised biopic of designer Jiro Horikoshi, The Wind Rises is a stunning achievement, an animated film that uses the medium to tell a compelling, highly emotional story that has appeal for children and adults alike. Horikoshi's designs were used during World War 2, and that detail may make The Wind Rises unpalatable to some. But Miyazaki's films have never focused on battle-lines, but on the personal stories involved, and The Wind Rises gains power from the balancing of the beauty of the designs against the knowledge that the purpose for which the designs will be used leads to death and unhappiness. It's a bitter-sweet paradox, and one that many directors would sweep under the carpet. Instead, Miyazaki puts Horikoshi's dilemma centre-stage, and depicts the designer's angst as he finds himself immersed in industrial and international intrigue while he attempts to keep his own thinking pure. A subplot, invented for the film, relates how Horikoshi's work life is informed by his chaste romance with Naoko, a woman with tuberculosis who won't marry until she recovers. Horikoshi's dreams take flight while his day-to-day reality struggles to leave the ground behind. The Wind Rises stirs up sensational aerial dream sequences, but also captures the bleakness of life on the ground, as Tokyo recovers from a devastating earthquake. Horikoshi and Naoko journey to the Magic Mountain resort in an effort to address her physical malaise, and their interaction with a mysterious German spy, beautifully voiced by Werner Herzog, sketches out the sinister world of warmongering that forms the backdrop to their romance. Studio Ghibli films have always been beautiful to watch, and The Wind Rises excels in every frame. But the overriding message, about the role of a gifted individual to overcome the constraints of society, is just as beautifully wrought; The Wind Rises is required viewing for anyone who wants to have their spirits lifted and soar like the wind for two blissful hours."
6,The Wind Rises,10,29 September 2013,The Beauty of Life,"There might be people saying that it was the bad thing to do to create airplane to kill people. However, the beauty of his life through his Mitsubishi Zero is worth viewing. The young guy lived with his dream, creating the beautiful airplane to fly in the free blue sky. It describe that even though there are many beautiful moments to live as a human being, the wart itself turns them into all evil. I felt like Hayao Miyazaki wanted to tell us the point. And even though under worst situation like world war, people live their own life, and those lives themselves are just so beautiful. Once you watch this movie, you must feel something warm from deep of your heart."
7,The Wind Rises,10,23 February 2014,Definitely Oscar worthy.,"So when I first saw that an anime called the Wind Rises was coming to theaters I could not wait to see it simply because it was an anime coming to theaters. I had no idea what the movie was about, but when I saw the movie, I discovered it was about one of my Favorite subjects, Airplanes. It's a very simple story that could have been done in Live-action. Jirou who as a boy met his hero, airplane designer, Caproni in his dreams was inspired to become an airplane designer. Years later Jirou lives his dreams and designs airplanes for a manufacturer who sells his beautiful designs to be used for the Ugly art of War. Jirou also fines love in the movie with a young girl name Naoko. All the characters in the movie who supported Jirou, from his little bratty sister, to his firm but fair boss, to his best friend and rival at work. They all help to make you feel like Jirou had a real posh life. I also loved how the story gives us a perspective of Japan pre-World War 2 through the life of Jirou. All of this could have been done in live action, but the craftsmanship of fame director Hayao Miyazaki makes you think otherwise. The animation takes a very surrealistic approach to telling this drama without making it seem cartoonish like Mickey Mouse. The scene portraying the great Kanto earthquake of 1923 made the ground feel like it was coming to life as a giant wave just took out an entire city. The Dream sequences worked very elegantly, just naturally seeming through. And the planes! the animation team did a great job of making the entire layout of the airplanes look fantastic. I've seen dramatic anime where the animation does nothing to push the story along but Mr. Miyaazaki did fine work to make sure that was not the case. It's been forever since I've seen a 2D moving illustration on the big screen, it felt a little weird, but this was definitely the movie to bring us all back to that. Someone told me that Hayao Miyazaki may retire after this one as he feels he can't top this. I will not disagree, because this one is excellent."
8,The Wind Rises,10,15 August 2013,"Another ""Visualized Masterpiece"" from Miyazaki","First of all, let me start by telling ""Woah, What a great movie"". Hayao Miyazaki's latest movie The Wind Rises is one of his best movies till date though the story line and plot is completely different from all his other movies which had a magical and fantasy feeling to it. It's nowhere near Spirited Away his best work till date but it ranks 3rd in my ghibli list after Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. The story, partly non-fiction, evolves around a young mechanical designer whose dream was to build beautiful airplanes. He ultimately succeeds in building fully up-to-date planes, but which went to war, and none came back.His personal life is set in Japan when people were facing great uncertainty after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, the Great Depression, and preparation for the war with China, then America, and Britain, and Netherlands, and the Soviets ... He and his colleagues do what they do best and what they are supposed to do under those circumstances: make planes. Just do it. His life enters into a new stage when he meets again accidentally with the girl whose life he saved during the earthquake. Their beautiful romance and eventual marriage is however overshadowed by her disease (tuberculosis, which was incurable at that time), and war.The ending completely pays off and blew me away in every term. The Movie is what we wanted from Miyazaki though intended for Mature Audiences only, I suggest everyone to watch this movie and I am sure that you will receive 1 ounce more pleasure than I did. 10/10 For this Masterpiece."
9,The Wind Rises,9,6 March 2014,Deeply beautiful,"Miyazaki's swan song, most likely. It's an animated biopic of Jiro Horikoshi, a Japanese aircraft engineer who developed the Zero, the plane which would eventually bomb Pearl Harbor and do kamikaze attacks in WWII. The man himself was a pacifist (at least according to this film). Most of the film just deals with the man's love for flight, which obviously makes the story very dear to Miyazaki. In fact, a good portion of the film takes place in Horikoshi's dreams, where he can invent any crazy contraption. First and foremost, the film is gorgeous. Though it mostly deals with the real world, it finds the beauty in it. As good as the film is, it isn't one of Miyazaki's best. It's a little long-winded and slow (definitely don't take your kids to it, even if they're big Ghibli fans). Miyazaki kind of neuters the militaristic history of Japan at that time. You can feel some terrible stuff going on in the background, but, outside of the Germans, whom our hero visits at one point, all the characters whom we meet are perfectly nice people. I would have liked a more detailed picture of history at the time. Also, the romance that is depicted in the film, which is entirely invented, is a tad too maudlin (though it is quite nice up front). And, though I won't hold it against the film itself, the English language dub is awful. This may be due to the film's specific, Japanese setting, but I really felt the voice actors were just dull as Hell. I hate to say it, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the lead role is the worst. The least offensive performances come from Martin Short and Mae Whitman (the latter is a professional voice actress who is great on Avatar: The Last Airbender, though she is best known for her role as Michael Cera's dull girlfriend Ann on Arrested Development). I wish I had just seen the subtitled version instead (it was playing here, but at an inconvenient theater). I might like the film better seeing it subtitled. All those criticisms don't amount to too much, though. It's a wonderful film."
10,The Wind Rises,5,13 May 2015,"Boring, overrated movie.","It's no secret that Mr. Hayao Miyazaki admired aviation since he was a boy and it is awesome that he turned that into an anime movie once again! However, it is unbelievable even for me to write this but honestly, The Wind Rises (2013) is a boring, overrated movie from the renowned Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli. The Wind Rises (2013) has received critical acclaim and has been dubbed as the farewell masterpiece of the award winning director Hayao Miyazaki most likely out of respect or marketing strategies but if we truly analyse it, this piece is much inferior even compared to much lower budget foreign animated features especially in the storytelling department.If you are expecting an inspiring film, there could be some scenes that are inspiring. If you are sensitive, there could be some elements could upset you. Then, there is a good chance that this will not satisfy you at all if you are looking for a good romantic or drama film and even if this might appeal to those who are genuinely in love with everything aviation or engineering, they might just experience frustration as the whole film seems to be a series of underdeveloped scenes put together.Despite there are some deep messages in the The Wind Rises (2013), both the storyline and characters are very dull even with decent music and animation. Perhaps this is not intended for everyone and not everyone will enjoy this but as a record, I watch this with an open mind, with genuine interest and patience until the very end; it is sad to report that I believe I am watching a poor attempt at a biographical film filled with the littlest dose of drama, romance and war. A weird and disappointing movie indeed."
11,The Wind Rises,4,28 January 2014,Disappointing movie - Doesn't meet expectations,"I am afraid this movie cannot be considered good. It is slow from the beginning to the end... At minute three I started to question myself... ""Why is this scene lasting 20 seconds ? 21, 22..."". I went to the theater without the knowledge of the synopsis... and I must say, it is the worst way of discovering the film. One must be warned before he watches the movie... that ""the wind rises"" has nothing to do with any other Miyazaki's productions. -- SPOILER -- I have read critiques praising Miyazaki for this ""fantastic, intense, poetic film""... In my opinion, any beginner could have made a better storyline... and the drama is just so common. It is dull, monotonous, slow. Half of the movie was 100% disappointing and boring, or cliché (""I have loved you from the moment I saw you"" etc). A slight interest caught me in the middle of the movie, when Jiro must struggle for his work and for his wife. Sadly, it is only a fictional part, nothing close to reality... so, well, could have been anything else.Besides, some moral values promoted by the film are disputable... Jiro lets his wife breathe his smoking because she doesn't want to leave him any second... He prefers that she stays living with him rather than having a chance of getting cured in the mountains. And so on. I think this is very childish. Nourishing such ideals is idiotic. There is nothing to be praised in the decisions of this couple. The film only presents a way of thinking at a given period of time, and takes no step back. Miyazaki casts a childish eye upon this couple when he should have been able to emphasize the flaws of this reasoning. Jiro could have made more compromises to take care of his wife... etc. ""But working is important for a man"" says Naoko's father. And... no rebellion, no step back, ... we're deep in some Japanese conceptions of life... and it bothers me deeply. In the same category, Naoko leaving the house not to be seen dead is another weird ideal. Such ideals are WRONG, for very known reasons : any man has a need for mourning when a person dies, and mourning is easier when the dead person can be seen, touched, buried... So basically, Miyazaki here is praising the ability to mourn without seeing the body. Jiro even says ""thank you"" to Naoko who asks him to go on living. I'm so shocked by all these idiotic ideals actually ! Anyway, all in all... their decisions could have made sense. Yes it makes sense when someone is suffering; and you know this person will die eventually; to please her in every way, even if it doesn't benefit her health... It is somehow the ""best"" thing to do when someone is about to die. But the problem is, they stopped fighting far too soon !! How could they know she was so much about to die ?! -- SPOILER -- Many elements of the film needed more depth or explanation or stepping back to make a good adult movie. But as for me, Miyazaki only casts a childish eye on matters way more complex. ""The wind rises"" is the typical example of work that gets fantastic critiques ONLY because of the name of the producer. Say it was ""The wind rises"" made by Unknown 001, it would not have received any good critique. People would have just watched the film for what it is, as I did. But since it's Miyazaki, everyone tries hard to see *what's HIDDEN*, because since it's Miyazaki it must be great !! So let's say the animation is tremendous !! Erm, guys, the animation is absolutely standard. We could expect much more for the last film from Miyazaki...It so seems I don't like any of the ""personal"" films from Miyazaki (""the wind rises"" and ""Porco Rosso"" as it seems). I do not share the passion for aviation at all and it feels like a neurosis of Miyazaki. To sum up, if you expect the usual Miyazaki fancy, do not watch this movie."
12,The Wind Rises,4,13 September 2013,Weak plot,"The advertising slogan of this film was 「生きねば」 -- do not give up no matter how tough your life is.However, the difficulties the protagonist happen to face are very few and mild, especially considering what the average Japanese citizens went through during the war. He is born to a rich family, gets his dream job at a first-class company without any struggle whatsoever, and is soon given a chance to study abroad in Germany and keeps pursuing his dream of designing a ""beautiful plane"".This was a time when young men were forced to die in the battlefields, never allowed to even have a dream except dying for the country, while the only real difficulty the protagonist faced that I could personally relate to was the fact that his wife was dying (and it was still very difficult to understand why he fell in love with his wife in the first place).The first half of the movie was a slow paced story about a man who pursued his dream without having to face any difficulty interesting enough to observe. The second half was a sloppy tear-jerker love story starring a young woman whose character depth was as shallow as the protagonist's.I may have been the shallow one but that was what I thought anyway."
13,The Wind Rises,10,1 November 2013,Gorgeous movie!,"I watched this movie yesterday night, on the International Cinema Festival here in São Paulo, Brazil. This movie is astonishing. It really feels lie a good-bye movie, but that is not what makes it sad. Although the movie is uplifting, colourful and with an amazing music score... it is quite sad to think that Grave of the Fireflies happened just a few years later! This movie is deliciously colourful. We can also see Miyazaki's style on the characters. They actually do the Totoro's head size changing thing when expressing strong emotions. One of the things that I really liked was the music score. It starts as a simple guitar, but in the end it evolves to a full orchestra. The sound effects are quite amazing as well. I felt that the Germany part of the movie was a tad slow, and some parts could be more developed, such as the flashligh part of the movie. This is a bit annoying, but is soon forgotten. The mixture between dreams and reality is delicious. I felt happy and warm inside watching all the happy people riding Caproni's plane. But in the same time... I felt sad, because, as I wrote above... this would all end in a few years or months. It is disturbing that the Zero would be used as a weapon and that many would not return. It is funny - the movie makes you feel good and uneasy on the same time. Still, this was one of the most gorgeous animation's I have ever seen. Mr. Miyazaki finished his career with a great movie, and his work sure be missed."
14,The Wind Rises,10,28 February 2014,Completely Worth the Long Wait for North American Release,"How do you even begin to talk about the final film from one of your favorite filmmakers to ever live? Japanese animation maestro, Hayao Miyazaki, has made some of the greatest animated films ever. From My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away, Miyazaki's imagination seemingly knows no bounds, so when he announced last Fall that The Wind Rises would be his last film before retirement, I immediately knew I had to see it on the biggest screen possible, no matter what. The Wind Rises is simply put, another Miyazaki masterpiece. If you are already a fan of his works, then you will love it, and even if this is your first taste, this very well might be the best place to start. The film tells the slightly fictionalized life story of one of Miyazaki's personal heroes, aeronautical engineer, Jiro Horikoshi. While Jiro is now more famously known as the man who built the Zero Fighter that the Japanese used to bomb Pearl Harbor, the real Jiro was a pacifist who only wanted to build something beautiful. The film follows Jiro from 1918 all the way through the start of World War II and details the sweet, yet tragic love story between him and his ailing wife, while also showing how Jiro was inspired to create the Zero Fighter.Upon seeing The Wind Rises, it's obvious why Miyazaki chose this particular story as his swan song, it features every major thematic idea of his various works all compiled into one narrative, and yet it is very different from any of his other films. Could Miyazaki have created another lavish fantasy adventure as his final film? He could have, and all of his fans would have watched it, but there's something special about The Wind Rises that makes it worth every ounce of salt in the world. Miyazaki's pacifism, his eccentricity, and his optimism are all on full display throughout the narrative, all represented through the eyes of Jiro and how he processes everything through vivid daydreams and his own quiet optimism.As far as the animation goes, the folks at Studio Ghibli have all done another marvelous job. The dream sequences, where Jiro envisions planes, are all some of the most gorgeous images Ghibli animators have ever drawn, and the way that the animators use wind, especially when dealing with any outdoor scene between Jiro and his wife, Nahoko, is simply stunning. There is an expressionistic flair to the wind that is very reminiscent to how Studio Ghibli approached the water in Ponyo. The wind feels alive and almost becomes a bit of an invisible puppeteer, often working as hard as the music to cue you into the emotions of the story. Speaking of the music, Miyazaki's longtime collaborator, composer Joe Hisaishi, has delivered another breathtaking score that manages to defy expectation with the Italian-inspired theme juxtaposed against the Japanese setting.I really can't say enough about The Wind Rises. Perhaps the film has so much resonance for me because I am such a huge Miyazaki fan (he ranks behind only Steven Spielberg in my book of favorite directors of all-time), but The Wind Rises truly is a sensational film as well. This is quite possibly the most romantic film Miyazaki has ever made, turning paper airplanes into a new form of love letter, while also delivering some of the most fully fleshed out characters Miyazaki has ever committed to film. Like all of Miyazaki's works, the characters are all slightly eccentric, funny, and extremely lovable, even in all of their flaws, but there is a depth to every character and their motivations, in particular Jiro and Nahoko, that is deeply moving.While The Wind Rises is not typical Miyazaki, the spirit of invention is still there in every frame, where you feel as if you are discovering a long lost epic from the Golden Age of Hollywood or something. That's actually how The Wind Rises feels to me. The Wind Rises is so simple, yet complex at the same time, and is consistently entertaining while being a movie you'll definitely want a hankie for. Thank you, Miyazaki-san, for this film and for a career that has inspired me so much.I give The Wind Rises a 10 out of 10!"
15,The Wind Rises,,5 June 2014,Dispirited Away,"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" - J. Robert Oppenheimer Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, ""The Wind Rises"" tells the tale of Jiro Horikoshi, designer of the Mitsubishi Zero, the lightweight and highly manoeuvrable fighter plane that enabled many Japanese victories early in World War II.""Humans have always dreamt of flight,"" Gianna Caproni, an Italian aeronautical engineer, tells Jiro, ""but the dream is cursed!"" In sequences like this, Miyazaki sets up the film's central theme: not only that flying machines will inevitably be used to massacre human beings, but that every human endeavour, every piece of art, every piece of technology, is inevitably compromised.Later, Jiro and Caproni discuss the Great Pyramids. ""I'd rather live in a world with pyramids than a world without,"" Caproni states. The implication is clear: dreams may be cursed, pyramids may be built by slaves to honour tyrants, but better them or nothing. That this is a false binary, or giant straw-man argument, is lost on Miyazaki; one can always extricate oneself from problematic actions or systems.But the difficulty in extricating oneself from such things, or noticing them in the first place, is what seems to interest Miyazaki. Jiro himself eventually emerges as a ""Little Eichmann"". A reference to Nazi bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann, the term refers to anyone who on an individual scale seems dutiful, benign or harmless, but is nevertheless complicit in aiding or propagating destruction. As such, Jiro's romantic idealisations are subverted throughout ""The Wind Rises"", culminating with the death of his wife to tuberculosis. Jiro may remain naive, but bombarded with much dread and apocalyptic imagery, Miyazaki's audience is never allowed to forget the darker ramifications of Jiro's actions.Though Miyazaki never really sanctions Jiro and Caproni's romantic rationalisations, the intensity at which Miyzaki portrays Jiro as a wide-eyed moron has led many to accuse ""The Wind Rises"" of whitewashing Jiro's historical role. Jiro's planes, after all, were built by Chinese and Korean slave labour. They were used to attack Korea, invade China, the Philippines, Vietnam and so forth. Historians point out that Japan's militarism was hardly unique in terms of early 20th century Imperialism (no better, the Empires of France, Russia, Britain and the burgeoning United States would account for far more deaths), but ""you did it too"" is no defence.Odd for a lead character, Miyazaki's Jiro is passive, lacking in any self-reflexivity, and never questions what's going on around him. Despite (or because of) this, the film works well as an allegory about the innocence, arrogance, myopia and culpability of artists, and the way in which states co-opt and pervert the aspirations of individuals. Such themes are typical in Japanese animated features (everything from ""Akira"" to ""Sky Crawlers""), the nation seemingly forever sceptical of urbanisation, modernisation and every new piece of technology it rampantly gobbles up. Miyazaki is himself a bit of a technophobe. ""Modern life is thin and shallow and fake,"" he moans in interviews, ""I look forward to when developers go bankrupt, Japan gets poorer and wild grasses take over!"" ""The Wind Rises"" is as gorgeous as Miyazaki previous films, bouncing from bucolic, agrarian Japan, to urban spaces, to several long flying sequences. Elsewhere scenes in 1930s Germany echo a German tourist's visit to Japan, and the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 foreshadows the atomic destruction of 1945. Jiro's wilful naiveté itself resembles that of the physicists who split the atom.What's perhaps most remarkable about ""The Wind Rises"", though, is the way it accurately captures the psychology of those working at the cutting edge of high tech industries. Jiro is intelligent, passionate and single-minded, but always moving between hotel rooms, offices and lonely spaces. This alienation, Miyazaki says, is precisely what makes Jiro's intelligence so dangerous. Cacooned and sheltered, Jiro belongs to a learned class which rarely meaningfully interacts with ""ordinary people"", and so rarely questions the morality and ramifications of its own behaviour. The result is a lead character whose brain is incredibly parcellated, steeped in all forms of sophisticated denial.This being Miyazaki, ""The Wind Rises"" is also obsessed with notions of ""Progress"". Miyazaki's Japan becomes corrupt and perverse as it embraces the ""emacipatory"" tenets of Modernism. These ""perversions"" are subtly mentioned by Miyazaki (if we ignore his heavy-handed dream sequences), such as sequences in which poor children roam the streets, or when banks foreclose on civilians. The result is a very sophisticated portrait of a nation in decline at the precise moment it embarks upon a project to lift itself up.Many have complained that ""Rises"" isn't as fun as Miyazaki's other works. Indeed, the film at times seems like a dour melodrama by Yasujiro Ozu. But Miyazaki subverts the conventions of the melodrama at every turn. Consider, for example, the way Jiro's blindness (literal and metaphorical) echoes the film's very own aesthetic and narrative structure, which relentless avoids looking at or thinking about warfare. For this is a film about a young man who is so preoccupied with love, life and aviation, that he doesn't realise that he's helping rain destruction down upon Japan (the spectre of the atomic bombings loom over the film). In this way, ""Rises"" plays like an anime version of Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" (or De Sica's ""The Garden of the Finzi-Continis""), another film in which surface beauty and foregrounded decor ironically counterpointed thematic underbellies.""Rises"" boasts Miyazaki's most autobiographical script since ""Whisper of the Heart"". Parallels are drawn between aeronautical engineers and animators, between hanger bays and animating studios, and Jiro at times resembles Miyazaki himself, with his bespectacled eyes and love of wind-swept wings. Elsewhere Jiro smokes Cherry cigarettes, Miyazaki's brand of choice, and scenes in which Jiro's sister accuses Jiro of neglecting his family echo Miyazaki's own outspoken fears. ""The Wind Rises"" is reportedly Hayao Miyazaki's last animated feature; farewell Master.8.5/10  Multiple viewings required. See ""The King of Pigs""."
16,The Wind Rises,10,6 August 2014,The perfect swan song for a great director,"This film went beyond my expectations and I am so glad I got to see it on the big screen. The Wind Rises (2013) is Hayao Miyazaki's swan song and he could not have bowed out on a better note than this. Going from the TV series Future Boy Conan (1978) to TWR shows how Miyazaki's vision has changed and evolved over the years; it's a beautiful thing.A loose biopic of Jiro Horikoshi, this film is a gorgeously animated meditation on art, love, war, and social responsibility. It's grown-up tone and refusal to answer life's big questions make it so unlike the animated fare we are continually fed in the United States. If I didn't already hold nothing but contempt for the Oscars, I would be furious that it lost to Frozen (2013), which is a cute but underwhelming movie.Let's hope Disney will release this for the home video market soon. This movie would also make a great double-feature with Porco Rosso (1992), another Miyazaki film concerned with the rise of fascism before WWII, albeit done in a more light-hearted manner."
17,The Wind Rises,10,3 August 2014,Beautiful!!!,"I have been watching Studio Ghibli films for only a little over a year. And by now, I have seen more than a dozen films. I have seen films released in 1986 (Laputa) to 2013 (The Wind Rises) and the beauty of the films has not decreased in 27 years. That's a long time to be consistent and I appreciate Studio Ghibli to still be producing films of such quality.I first watched The Wind Rises just after watching Grave of the fireflies (which is a great movie itself) and therefore could not appreciate the film to that extent. Having recovered from Grave of the fireflies after about 2 weeks, I watched the film again and was astounded. And since then, I have watched the film 3 more times. The magic doesn't seem to fade. Its still there.And what a soundtrack. It is the best of all Ghibli/Miyazaki Films and whatever credit you give to Joe Hisaishi, it is still less. The music is stuck in my head since then and with the same intensity. I can not overemphasize the beauty of this film. There are a lot of strong moments, moments which will persist even after a long time. You feel like you have gone back to childhood. There are a lot of themes touched. Love, Sacrifice, Regret, Determination to name a few. Its more of an experience than a film. Its a tribute to Flight and Animation and if its to be Mr. Miyazaki's swan song, then it is fitting enough be considered one of his if not the best. There are not a lot of things you can call beautiful, but this surely is... Great work!!!"
18,The Wind Rises,9,19 July 2014,A Flight of Imagination,"I'm going to pull out all the stops as I'm trying to verbalize how mightily impressed I am with ""Kaze tachinu"" (2013), or ""The Wind Rises"". Miyazaki has now been at the top of his game for well over thirty years, and his latest and apparently last film is remarkable in all the usual modi operandi  luxuriant use and understanding of colour, extraordinary level of detail in even the most mundane-seeming particulars that make the scenes come to life, fantastical sense of the relationship between dreams and imagination and reality, and how the story stems from the images and extends to the world of the creator, and ours. The film tells the story of Horikoshi Jiro, a genius whose enthusing search for perfection makes him descend the dream-path laid down in his youth. A story of determination, the film is also a profound meditation on the forces of nature: Tokyo destroyed in the earthquake and by fire, the aircraft in shreds and pieces. The influence and inspiration given to Jiro by what only he seems to be able to see around him makes him the visionary that he is. Airplanes, trains, ships, radiators. The path to advance technology, first by exposure, then by imagination and invention. To be either Achilles, twenty years behind, or the tortoise. Filmmaking is very much the same: seeing the unseen, imagining that which has not been imagined. This is not compromise or pampering to the lowest common denominator, but art that goes all the way beyond our wildest dreams and is still able to describe the indescribable so lucidly we become enraptured and immediately converted.All the Miyazakis I've seen have some incredulously indelible moments without compare. Here there are several, including the utterly beautiful dreams, especially the wind, the opening five minutes in full, the remarkable sound design during the dreams and the earthquake, the water, the rain, and the flight.And speak of the wind! It has personality, it's brilliant and as powerful as in ""Ran"" (1985), ""Zerkalo"" (1975) or ""The Wind"" (1928), in some ways even more so because it's animated in ways impossible to achieve in live action. And the love that uncharacteristically seems to evade and elude, as it does in Wong Kar-Wai's ""Fa yeung nin wa"" (2000). She paints, and the picturesque mise en scène and the atmosphere is comparable to ""Van Gogh"" (1991) and its languorous lushness. Then there's Thomas Mann's ""The Magic Mountain"" used by Castorp as an allegory for forgetting, yet the novel becomes real through Nahoko's illness and not as a token of forgetting but instead of never forgetting.And then there's the war. ""It flies like a dream"", the pilot says, thanking Jiro during the apparent climax of the film, and Miyazaki cuts to a scene of utter destruction, a cemetery of people, ideals, ideas and technology, a disaster not unlike the earthquake in the beginning, yet so tragically unlike.The name of the film comes from a quotation from Paul Valéry, but refers to Ghibli: the name of the studio but also the engine of the aircraft in ""Porco Rosso"" (1992). It's a real engine used in an Italian aircraft during World War II, designed by the Caproni seen in the film. In a way, then, this is as natural a conclusion to Miyazaki's career as one could imagine: a flight of imagination, carried by the most powerful wind, and a shared dream of great minds that we are lucky to be invited in."
19,The Wind Rises,10,1 July 2014,"Most beautiful work of all the beautiful works by Hayao Miyazaki, Studio Ghilibi","I am a huge fan of Hayao Miyazaki Movies under the banner of Studio Ghilibi. His movie have always made life much more beautiful. And THE WIND RISES surpasses all his previous work and the whole movie us like a dream, a dream with every second containing beauty, beauty in music, in scenes, in characters and in the story. I am lucky I was born in a generation and able to watch Hayao Miyazaki's work.His every work is like a dream and in this movie the dreams which protagonist sees inspire any one to his bone. His movies always make me want go to Japan once in a life. The world is much much more beautiful from the eyes of Hayao Miyozaki. Also the music that his movies have is out of this earth! I want the soundtrack of his movies to play in my brain for whole life. I am not telling what happened in the movies cause it unfair to put his work into words and every one must watch, hear and feel it by themselves and if they don't, well not everyone one can be that lucky."
20,The Wind Rises,6,4 April 2014,"Gorgeous whitewash, but whitewash nonetheless","""The Wind Rises"" is a beautifully crafted and highly enjoyable movie. Its story of an obsessively brilliant young man given to dreaming extravagant dreams and then actually realizing those dreams is timeless. When viewed purely as a cinematic experience, ""The Wind Rises"" is an achievement of a very high order.Unfortunately, the film has two significant flaws. First, the handling of the character of the movie's protagonist, Jiro Horikoshi, is regrettable. Jiro is portrayed in uniquely heroic terms. From an early age, we see him acting with the utmost virtue under any and all circumstances -- rescuing young children from bullying, carrying a woman for miles and miles on his back in the aftermath of an earthquake, etc. Given the complexity of the animation, this oversimplification of Jiro's character is jarring and his portrayal sometimes becomes mawkishly sentimental and irritating.More significantly, this film glorifies the work and life of a designer of military airplanes that were used to kill many thousands of people. In scene after scene, the Japanese military-industrial complex of the 1930s is portrayed as employing a wonderfully sincere and good-natured group of men who were ready to roll up their shirtsleeves and work day and night to build ""beautiful planes."" The passing references to what those planes would be used to do, to the devastation of war, are noticeable but have little impact on the viewer. Bathed in the warm glow of Miyazaki's incredible animation, the audience feels the few brief references to war and devastation as if they were mild bumps on a very smooth airplane flight.The scenes of Jiro and his colleagues when they visit pre-war Germany are quite telling in this regard. Although the scenes in Germany do include some highly controlling German behavior, as well as a scene of someone being pursued at night by a gang of well-dressed thugs, not one single swastika is shown during perhaps 20 minutes of footage. The word ""Nazi"" is never uttered. Although the name ""Mr. Hitler"" is uttered much later in the film during a conversation Jiro has with a German at a Japanese resort -- the man has a very large nose and is perhaps a regrettable caricature of a Jewish person -- the name ""Mr. Hitler"" is spoken only once and with complete neutrality, as if Jiro is saying the name ""Mr. Smith.""This movie's brief allusions to wartime devastation and its omission of any mention of Japan and Germany's heinous ideologies greatly compromised my experience. It portrays Jiro, an enabler of terrible worldwide aggression, in the most heroic and reverent terms. If for domestic Japanese political or commercial reasons Miyazaki could not offer a more realistic and balanced story of Japan's preparations for, and its predations during, World War II, then he should have chosen a different subject for his film. This comic book fantasy-adventure left me angry and sad, and for all the wrong reasons."
21,The Wind Rises,,12 September 2013,Studio Ghibli,"This movie is the latest work of Studio Ghibli. The hero has dream. He really likes airplane when he is young. However, his eyes are not good. So, he becomes the engineer of airplane. He has a best friend. He is also the engineer of airplane. Airplane is the all of him. One day, he meets a woman. She is a destiny. They fall in love and?This story is little difficult for me. It is because may be there is a message that I cannot find out I watch it once. I want to watch one more. Of course I can understand this story. However, I think, there is a more message. I like the scene that he and his best friend talk about the airplane. When I watch the scene, I think it is the beautiful that people are absorbed in one thing. I want to find my favorite thing I can forget other things and be absorbed in.I recommend you this movie. If you watch it, you will want to find your favorite thing."
22,The Wind Rises,5,4 March 2014,No Fly Zone,"This film is not recommended.Filmmaker Hayeo Miyazaki's last animated film, The Wind Rises, tells the real-life story of Jiro Horikoshi, an engineer and designer of Japanese fighter planes during World War II. Drawn in the anime style with its stylized detail and realistic backgrounds, the film plays like a historical biography and doesn't shy away from its adult storyline. This is a serious-minded animated film for adults which never panders to a younger audience. There are no happy songs, cute characters, or overblown theatrics involved. There is also no excitement, joy, or any semblance of emotional connection. The heavy-handed story continually weighs the film down even if the film's artistic inventiveness is, at times, buoyant and quite lovely to behold.Miyazaki's vision is known for his whimsical and other worldly themes as in films like My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, and Spirited Away. Here he stays mostly grounded in realism due to the screenplay that goes through the paces of this man's life. Whereas in his past efforts, Miyazaki's films were populated with strange creatures in a fascinating surreal world that enchanted viewers with his unique poetic viewpoint, those trademark bizarre and mystical creatures are nowhere to be found. In The Wind Rises, the acclaimed animator is now tether to the real world with only occasional flights of fantasy in the form of Jiro's dreams to free Miyazaki's creative imagination and engage his audience. His storytelling grounds the film for all the wrong reasons and the film never soars. The film is a disappointment, a film so conventional and boringly told, sidestepping important details about the main character's obsessive work with new models of fighter planes that actually were used at the Pearl Harbor invasion, a fact never mentioned.A tender love story of Jiro and Nahoko, ably voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt, becomes a more interesting subplot. But weak voice-over work by an all-star cast nearly sabotages the film. The dialog is barely passable, with too much over-emoting by Mandy Patinkin, John Krasinski, Elijah Wood, William H. Macy, and Jennifer Grey. Even worse are some characters that become racial stereotypes of Italian (Stanley Tucci), German (Werner Herzog), and Japanese ethnic groups, both in tone with the actors' heavy accents and in the physical caricatures as they are artistically rendered. (In fact, one character, Mr. Kurokawa, is so overplayed by Martin Short that it becomes a borderline offensive parody onto itself. (That character is so reminiscent of Mickey Rooney's political incorrect interpretation of I.Y. Yunioshi from Breakfast at Tiffany that I was gobsmacked at its disturbing comparison.)Artistically, there is so much to admire with the visual look of the film but not much to really get excited about. Besides its sluggish plotting, the film mixes too many styles that just don't mesh very well: detailed hand drawn linear contours with rich pastel colors, painterly watercolor washed settings that create wonderful atmospheric effects, but are impressive computer generated imagery that, nevertheless, is jarringly misapplied. The anime facial features are indistinctive and lacking depth, especially when placed in the real-life environs of the true story being told.Horikoshi was once quoted to have said, "" All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful."" Miyazaki has done so with The Wind Rises. The director has crafted a beautiful looking film as his swan song. Too bad the overall effect of the film seemed emotionally inert to me.

23,The Wind Rises,8,16 November 2013,Final full-length feature film from Hayao Miyazaki,"The Wind Rises (Miyazaki, 2013): Japan Reviewed by Larry Gleeson. Viewed at the AFI Filmfest 2013.""The Wind Rises,"" is a new animated, full-length, feature film from legendary Japanese animation director, Hayao Miyazaki. Miyazaki announced at this year's Venice Film Festival this will be his last film. In 1997 his ""Princess Mononoke,"" was the highest revenue grossing film in the history of Japan at the time of its release and it also received the Japanese equivalent of an Academy Award for Best Film. Miyazaki is also well known for the films ""Spirited Away,"" (2001) and ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" (2004) In 2003 Miyazaki received an Oscar for Best Animated Feature for the film ""Spirited Away,"" His films have garnered international acclaim from critics and have provided Miyazaki public recognition within Japan. His films are known for compelling characters, engaging plots and eye-catching animation. Remarkable by today's standards his films allow no more than 10% of the footage to come from computer animation.In ""The Wind Rises,"" Miyazaki tells the story of Jiro Horikoshi, a real-life aeronautical engineer who designed fighter aircraft in Japan during WWII. The film opens with the young Jiro fantasizing of his plane flying above his hometown. As I watched the scene unfold, a rather powerful ominous feeling surfaced as I was reminded of Leni Riefenstahl's opening scene from the Nazi propaganda documentary, ""Triumph of the Will."" Nevertheless the early moments of the film are very heartwarming as Miyazaki chooses to highlight Jiro's youth as an older brother to a delightfully spirited younger sister in a single parented household run by their kind and caring mother.Jiro's passion throughout the film is making good airplanes. Jiro's daydreaming, which he does a few times during the story's arc. Admittedly, several of my favorite moments are Jiro's imaginings with Count Caproni, a larger-than-life mustachioed Italian airplane designer who mentors Jiro with playful and good natured ribbing, and provide insight into Jiro's creative passion. Jiro finds his inspiration through such moments and Miyazaki makes space for them throughout the film.The story is partially based on Tatsuo Hori's 1938 novelette, ""The Wind Has Risen."" Miyazaki's animation provides beautiful plush scenery with Monet-like backdrops and landscapes providing striking visuals while creating a powerful nostalgia for a simpler time lightly brushing over the complications of war and economic depression. With such a breathtaking mise-en-scene it's no wonder a young Jiro falls in love with the young woman he saved during a traumatic, historic earthquake a few years before (the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake). In direct juxtaposition to this frantic and rather manic scenario in the aftermath of the earthquake, young Jiro finds himself vacationing in a rural setting enjoying the greenery and the soft ""rising"" winds complete with majestic and billowing, flowery clouds when he coincidentally crosses paths with the beautiful girl he saved from the earthquake as she paints poetically on a hillside overlooking the spectacular countryside.""The Wind Rises,"" is a very light-hearted film, entertaining film. The film focuses pretty much exclusively on the protagonist, Jiro as an idealistic engineer whose primary purpose in life is to make planes. Granted, he falls in love and rubs elbows with German plane builders during WWII. Yet, WWII and the social unrest after the Great Kanto Earthquake are left virtually untouched. Tellingly, Jiro's concern at the end of the war was over the planes that didn't come back. Nevertheless, I wholeheartedly recommend the film for children and for adults with a penchant for Monet-esque visuals."
24,The Wind Rises,3,27 March 2014,Melodrama,"(Late review: we get films late here in this cultural backwater) I've seen 2 other Miyazaki films-- Mononoke and Howl's Castle-- and thought them wonderfully zany and imaginative in an almost hallucinatory way. _Wind Rises_ is an exception to that. It is beautifully realized graphically, but those lovely animations are ruined by a frankly dull, clichéd, and melodramatic story. (see similar films which are well-done visually but poor in story qualities-- Avatar and Titanic). The story is one Hollywood has made over and over again-- poor boy rises from the ranks (Alger plot line) to overcome hidebound superiors and opponents (Rocky) while struggling with a dying girlfriend (Camille, any Joan Crawford weepy). Not only is that story tired, but it relies much too heavily on easy emotion-- just show a young person dying and we're all supposed to break down crying. Bleh. (I define ""melodrama"" as middle-quality drama, in which too much emotional content is loaded onto ill-supported dramatic circumstances.) I can't recommend this to anyone heretofore impressed by Miyazaki's wildly inventive imagination."
25,The Wind Rises,8,30 January 2014,HK Auteur film review - The Wind Rises,"I must admit that I stopped watching animated films since elementary school; hence my knowledge of Miyazaki's filmography is minimal. The only Hayao Miyazaki films I am familiar with are Castle in the Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro. Castle in the Sky remains my favorite. But perhaps I can lend an outsider's perspective. Adapted from his own manga, The Wind Rises is a fictionalized account of the life of Jiro Horikoshi, the aircraft designer of the Mitsubishi A5M and A6M Zero, two fighters that were used in World War II. Jiro's story spans from his childhood all the way to adulthood, covering Jiro's employment for the airplane manufacturer during WWII and the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, where he meets Naoko, who he later falls in love with.With its Monet-like skies and lush renditions of historical landscapes, the animation, particularly in Jiro's dream sequences, is gorgeous. I had forgotten how lifelike Miyazaki's characters move and behave. I recommend seeing this film in a theater if it is available, as much of the fun is losing yourself in the animated world.The historical context evokes unsettling memories in the segment set in Nazi Germany. The grand romanticism of the animation and Jiro's pursuit of becoming an aircraft designer just seem trivial placed against the events of WWII.The story is glacially paced, and without any fantastical elements or a villain, children will be bored. Dreamers make great characters, but I doubt Jiro Horikoshi will be on any fan's list of top ten Miyazaki's protagonists. I assume fans might expect something epic and fantastical for Miyazaki's last film, and he does not seem to be in any way interested in doing that.Hayao Miyazaki's family manufactured metal parts that went into the A6M Zero fighter airplane designed by the real-life Jiro Horikoshi, and there is a heavy sense of autobiographical elements of an author accessing his legacy by revisiting his roots. Miyazaki has chosen to make his farewell by telling a story about dreams and man's pursuit of them. In life, we may achieve our dreams, but not in the way we want to achieve them. But in the end, it's important not to drivel in perfections and appreciate what you have.Perhaps Miyazaki is delivering this message to himself, in the context to his retirement, but it is a poignant way to say farewell no less. Prepare the tissues or a faux man cough, because if you go along with the story patiently, it is a touching message that is said with heart."
26,The Wind Rises,2,16 September 2015,"A superficial, clichéd and dull attempt at an historical anime","I must admit, I had high expectations before watching this movie. I heard tons of positive reviews, and as a Miyazaki movie, I expected it to be poetic, deeply touching and rather sad. It seems numerous people felt that way when they saw it: it didn't work on me the tiniest bit.What I liked: -the depiction of Japan in a modernization and westernization phase, something we rarely see on TV. Traditional kimonos side with western costumes, modern cars move along ancient ox carriages. The way this modernization impacts on the people could have been deepened though, even if it's not central to the movie-the depiction of the work of engineers, the many little details that they have to take into account and that inspire them: the weight of screws, the form of a fish bone. This is also something rarely seen on TV that I for myself find quite fascinating.-the beautiful landscapes and colors you expect of a Miyazaki moving. Since it shows the real world you may not be ""spirited away"", but still I found it very pretty.What I didn't not enjoy: pretty much everything else. - First of all: ""The wind rises"" is veeeeery repetitive. I couldn't count the amount of train rides, plane crashes, dream flights with Caproni, unsubtle hints on the movie's maxim (Paul Valéry citation ""Le vent se lève"", wind blows in the face of the hero), and repetitions of this quite pretty melody that becomes extremely annoying the tenth time it is repeated (seriously, almost all of the film had one and the SAME melody).The story arc: in my opinion there was none. No suspense, no tension, the movie is just a 2 hours-long sequence of unrelated scenes glued to each other in a chronological manner. No character or relationship development either, and even some plot holes. I like slow paced movies where few happens (Sofia Coppola is one of my favorite director), but they have to be hypnotic, they shouldn't give you this feeling of waiting (which gives you the opportunity to ponder upon the reason why you keep watching). I waited during the whole movie to feel implicated, but nope, I was just bored beyond belief. -This is mainly due to the characters and their relationships to each other, that feel extremely superficial and clichéd. Jiro is the good, studious and naive boy (with a few ""knight in a white armor""-scenes), Naoko is shy, fragile and soooo in love, Kayo the little sister is a grumpy-faced Chihiro, the few Germans are cold and harsh control-freaks. That over the 20 years of the story none of the faces evolve doesn't help. The romance between perfect workaholic Jiro and his devoted (submissive?) wife that hasn't any background story and any wish of her own (except to die without disturbing her husband?!!) is also really disturbing and syrupy sweet, but let's skip this part. -the main reason why I didn't like is the light and very oblique way it spoke about Japanese history, WW2 and the role of our nice hero Jiro. Jiro and his team conceived the Mitsubishi Zero, one of the deadliest plane of WW2, that was assembled by Korean and Chinese slaves? Let's not lose ONE SINGLE WORD about it. After all, poor Jiro didn't see one of his beloved planes come back from war. After all, Jiro has one or two naive pacifist punchlines: ""I just wanted to build beautiful planes"" ""the weight of the plane will fit if we leave out the machine guns"". Should be enough to excuse what he'd done for fascism in Japan. Which isn't acknowledged, either. The only suffering you see or hear of is that of the poor Japanese people (Tokyo earthquake, ruins after Americans bombed the country...), not the one Japan brought upon the whole Pacific. It could have been a nice tale about the impact of naive geniuses on the world, but it's not. Just feels like avoidance. To me, Miyazaki gets none of it: the seriousness, the madness and the cruelty of that era of history. This film is ill-conceived and unreflected, and I'm still amazed by its critical acclaim. Definitely not a movie I'll recommend, except in a reflection upon whitewashing and Japan's blinkered examination of its own history."
27,The Wind Rises,10,21 March 2014,A Great Signature Animation by a Master of the Art,"I have been an ardent follower of animation as an adult for 40 years now and believe this film to be at the pinnacle of the hand drawn animation style. With the trend towards CGI and Hayao Miyazaki's intended retirement, there is not likely to be another example as fine as ""The Wind Rises"". I feel privileged to have seen it.As expected for a Studio Ghibli film, the quality of the animation was of the highest order. The detail and beauty of the backgrounds and landscapes was magnificent. There was no shortcuts taken on crowd scenes and panoramic. Even as a veteran animation viewer there were moments in this film that just left me in awe. The clouds over Tokyo after the earthquake, the dance of light and shadows in the streets of Berlin and the wind catching the shade umbrella were just some scenes that cause an immediate visceral response in me. The story, I know, is problematic for some people. It is about aircraft designer Jiro Horikoshi and his struggles leading up to the creation of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter plane, known to the allies as the Claude (not the Zero as some have suggested). Interwoven into the film is a love story between Jiro and Naoko, a girl he meets and helps during the earthquake. Japan was largely a pre-industrial society at this time, desperately trying to modernise in order to catch up to western nations that looked down on it as an inferior upstart. I thought this was shown beautifully in this film. One aspect I particularly liked was the way he contrasted the trains of Japan with those of Europe. Western nations paid lip service to helping Japan modernise its aircraft and Jiro soon realised that they would have to make the leap forward themselves and not rely on others for help. This is at the core of the film.The Claude was the first all-metal monoplane fighter designed for carriers and meant that Japan made the leap from being behind everyone else in this field of technology to world leaders. To have advanced so far in such a short time took the world by surprise and this gave Japan confidence that it was not inferior to western nations. That was to me was the key theme, that with imagination, perseverance and dedication, great things can be achieved.There has been some criticism about how much war guilt should be expressed in this film. The obvious connection to being on the ""wrong side"" of World War II clouds some peoples vision of the points raised in the film. I believe these criticisms are ill-informed. Japan's road to war was due to a mix of militarism and lack of viable civilian government and not to the invention of a particular plane. It would have happened regardless with the same outcome. I feel that this may well be Hayao Miyazaki's last film because there is so much reflection in it on themes that have been so close to him over his career. His love of the inter-war period of planes, trains, ships and cars etc where there was an enormous variation in design. The struggle in the modernisation of Japan while striking a balance with their cultural and traditional beliefs and way of life. Even the appearance of tuberculosis reminded me of his earlier work.I fully embraced this film and cannot wait to watch it again."
28,The Wind Rises,9,1 March 2014,One of the best animated films of 2013,"The Wind RisesLets look at this film both quality wise and favorite wise. Quality wise: The animation in this film is just absolutely breathtaking.It's like a work of art. The story line is very emotional and realistic. It showcases what Japan was like during World War 2 and the Great Depression. The movie is a story of both war and love at the same time.Quality wise this film gets an overall A+. Favorite wise: I like this movie. I'm not an anime type of guy but I seriously love this movie. It's funny, it has great animation, the characters are pretty well developed. The movie just overall relaxes you and gives you a smile on your face when you walk out of the theater, or your living room, or what ever room you watched this movie in on your smartphone. It is definitely one of my favorite animated films of all time. I give this film an A+.Therefore, I will end this review by saying both quality wise and favorite wise: This film gets 9.8/10 stars."
29,The Wind Rises,9,18 February 2014,"Master Storyteller's Rendition of a Master Craftsman, Miyazaki at his finest!","One of Hayao Miyazaki's most mature, important, and legendary films. This is definitely one of his more adult films, but nevertheless an amazing film for all to watch. It's a story of a boy, Horikoshi Jiro, the designer of the ""Zero Fighter"", who becomes an aviation engineer and through his journey falls in love and looses that love. Set in WWII, the story of Jiro's dream to make a beautiful plane does not mask the grim reality of Japan's economic and social state, but rather gives hope and light at such a dark time. The historical references intertwined with Miyazaki's own fantasy world is perfectly balanced. The animation is out of this world jolting and vibrant. The Kanto earthquake of 1923 is something to behold on the big screen. There are no words, you just have to see it. This farewell masterpiece is nothing short of amazing, stunning, and everlasting."
30,The Wind Rises,5,12 February 2014,An old man's lingering poetry,"Miyazaki last opus is a very moody piece of poetry with no magic and little enchantment. Sad way to say good bye to his fans.Obviously Miyazaki simply wanted to bequeath his own philosophy of life: it is a deeply personal work but, unlike in his masterpieces, with little universality. The same mantra, the Paul Valery verses, is repeated half a dozen times textually and countless times visually.Despite the recurring dream sequences this movie is stuck in the harsh realities of the period it covers: totalitarian and imperialist Japan in its buildup to war, in line with European dictatorships. Thus there's no room for the magic we loved in previous works. The dream themselves are constricted by the prospect of war from the very beginning. Sadly the main dream come true is the love story, but it is secondary to this boy's dream of building beautiful planes.In the end Miyazaki simply displays his bare soul, apologising that his creative years are behind him and teaching us a depressing lesson about life and dreams and love."
31,The Wind Rises,8,18 September 2013,This movie made me think.,"This movie draws an actual person, half life of Jiro Horikoshi. Jiro wants to make beautiful airplanes. He respects Caproni who is an Italian airplane producer. One day Jiro meets Nahoko whom he met by a train in the middle of the Great Kanto Earthquake again. They fall in love, but Nahoko suffers from tuberculosis.This movie's director is Hayao Miyazaki. This movie is difficult for me because I do not know background of the times when Japan had war and it has deep meaning. I thought Honjou and Kurokawa's character is so good because they help Jiro and they hang on work for their dream. I thought scenery is so beautiful and Caproni who came out to a dream of Jiro said a good thing. The theme song of a movie ""Hikoukigumo"" is so good and it much this movie perfectly.I do not know this movie's conclusion. I think that there is a various how to catch. It is the movie with the pro and con but I recommend you."
32,The Wind Rises,8,4 September 2013,Great Film. But very challenging to grip with the context.,"This is a beautiful fictionalized story about Jiro Horikoshi who was a designer of Japanese planes that were used in world war II. That's the challenge. This could have easily been a movie about the person who invented machine guns or chemical weapons. I am sure somewhere in those people's lives is a beautiful and touching story. Yes the Japanese went through a tough time in WWII but then so did the people and countries they went to war with. I believe this film would be more acceptable had it not been a biopic so it doesn't have that baggage of reality.In an interview with Japanese actor Ken Watanabe on another war movie ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" points out ""...Unfortunately, most Japanese people aren't aware of this tragedy; even I didn't know until I did the film. It's difficult to say why, but perhaps it has something to do with the lack of a good education. This film deals with only one of many tragedies in the history of the world, but hopefully it will get people to think more about these forgotten incidents."" In watching this film, you need to take into account the context that Miyazake is trying to operate in. He wanted to remind people of the past but he clearly takes pride in his culture and history but has to side step the accountability of this main character to a certain degree. This is very hard to do. But whether this is intentional the main character's tragic loss in the end seems to suggest that karma like accountability."
33,The Wind Rises,6,24 February 2015,Not Ghibli's finest hour...,"...but a pretty decent movie all the same, THE WIND RISES is, like FROM UP ON POPPY HILL, a Studio Ghibli movie set in the real world and based on a true story. The film chronicles the life and times of Jiro Horikoshi, an engineer who designed the aeroplane that would be infamously used in Japan's 'kamikaze' raids in WW2.I'm more than happy with the source material and claims of 'poor taste' regarding the real-life devastation caused by the Japanese attacks are wrong-founded: are we to whitewash history and pretend it never happened? No, what disappointed me about THE WIND RISES is the romantic sub-plot, that takes up a large part of the film. It's not twee and sickly sweet like in a Disney animation, but I did find it unnecessary and these scenes really dragged the pacing down. I wanted more engineering - how many films do we see about engineers? - not the same old."
34,The Wind Rises,10,28 June 2014,568th Review: Simply A Beautiful & Moving Film About Love And Flight,"Kaze tachini (The Wind Rises) contains scene after scene of breathtaking animation - there are extraordinary images simply presented. Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki have over the past forty years produced some of the greatest animated film work of all time. Their films are noted for their non-Disney imagination and creativity. The Wind Rises continues that tradition.The Wind Rises is the animated biography of Japan's greatest airplane designer: Jiro Hirokoshi. This gives Miyazaki a chance to do stunning flying sequences (and landscapes) as well as other scenes. In keeping with Japan's post-war ethos there are no war scenes, instead the film chooses to look at the earlier life and is really a film about love - and not just love of flying.I guess I watch a lot of films - it takes a lot for me to feel captivated - this film is captivating, not just visually, it has story, pace, and purpose - and it is clearly from the hand of the extraordinary imagination of Miyazaki."
35,The Wind Rises,10,28 September 2017,"Half an engineer, half a poet, eternally a dreamer","... maybe that's Miyazaki's secret, finally unveiled in his latest movie: ""The Wind Rises"".You know, it's been three months since I discovered his work and I never had to experience any kind of disappointment. And although I got used to his unequaled capability to catch my eyes and my heart, some of his movies really hit a sensitive chord, like ""Kiki"" or ""Ponyo"" and perhaps the action-less moments of ""Nausicaa"".But I can't really describe the effect ""The Wind Rises"" had on me. For one thing, I'm glad I'm discovering it late because it's the film that best captures Miyazaki's love for airplanes. His passion never went unnoticed; how could it be? Almost half of his movies involve airplanes, flying devices or stunts in the air, but there has always been an element of fantasy that distracted from the personal approach he had to flying, even in ""Porco Rosso"" which was the most explicit homage to the Italian contribution to aviation.But ""The Wind Rises"" made me realize how fantasy is perhaps the sincerest medium to convey passionate matters, because -to put it simply- it's all about dreams and vision that wait for the right wind to carry them a little and give them that extra push they need for flying. ""The wind has risen, one must try to live"" is the excerpt from Paul Valéry's poem that novelist Hori Tatsuo used as an inspiration for a tragic romance, and who else than Miyazaki could explore such a story, he who had dedicated all his life to things in the air, from feelings to plain things (pun intended). One thing he had in common with Jiro Horikochi, the main protagonist.The film deals with planes in a way that has never been touched by Miyazaki, it's not about flying but about the dreams of flying, their very blossoming in the fertile soil of a man's mind. In fact, the film is less devoted to planes than to the devotion of a boy, then a man, who designed the Imperial Army's most notorious aircraft. They were used in the war but the film has a point to make about war. Miyazaki believes in Jiro's humanism and expresses it through very riveting dreamy moments. Jiro is a dreamer, literally, and whenever he dreams, he meets his all-time idol, Italian Giovanni Caproni. Together they share their views about planes, their universal appeal and sadly their belligerent uses (or misuses).But don't get it wrong, just because it's in the poetic vicinity of Miyazaki's usual works, the film is as realistic as any serious biography picture, although fictionalized with a romance adapted from the ""Wind Has Risen"" novel and many events that struck Japan from the Great Depression to Kanto's earthquake, and last but not least, the war. Jiro is portrayed as a witness of his time who must adapt to the evolution of society, a two-pace society with a feudal heritage yet trying to match the Meiji dream. The most emblematic image is the prototype being pulled by ox. This is Miyazaki's most personal film, it has Japan, it has humanism and well, it has planes. And to give you an idea, this film is far more revealing about Jiro than ""A Beautiful Mind"" with John Nash. There was something so catching in Jiro's passion, in the way he kept focused on his job. I could even feel I was venturing into his mind as if Miyazaki met him in his dreams before making this film. I have no clues about planes but I do love a movie about passion, this is a film about a man who loves planes by a man who loves them. To judge a good biopic, I guess it all comes to the area of passion driving the maker. Having thick glasses, Giro could never fly but Caproni almost rhymes with epiphany, the Italian icon tells him that he can't even fly a plane, but there's just something far more exhilarating than creating. And Miyazaki wouldn't disagree.The heart of the film is centered on the romance between Jiro and a gentle tuberculosis stricken girl, like Hori's wife who inspired the novel. And whenever they meet, the wind rises and make their encounter possible. Air is our universal heritage, in the film, it reunites people and give a proper meaning to their life. This air so fragile in ""Nausicaa"", this air that symbolizes peace in a world that prepares to war and about which the post-apocalyptic Nausicaa warned us. Miyazaki signs his best film. I enjoyed it so much it could have been twice longer, to the post-war period time.But the film culminates with the tragic ending and doesn't show much of the war. It is anticlimactic to use a technical term, but I guess it's a fine ending because there wasn't much to add about Jiro once he designed the prototype, once the plane that started as a concept hidden behind a fish bone became a technological marvel. The film is dedicated to the engineer and to the poet. And the verse ""The Wind Rises, one must try to live"" is so beautiful it could work as an epitaph for Hayao Miyazaki, summing up his best contribution to animation: inviting us to dream, to pursue our dreams and to take them seriously like a poet, a bit like an engineer, always like a dreamer.This is one of the greatest animated movies of recent times, and given how critical I was about ""Frozen"", I was shocked that it won the Oscar. From what I read, there was some controversy surrounding the peaceful nature of Jiro, a sugarcoating of the war and an overuse of smoking. I'd say ""The Wind Rises"" deserved better than being beaten by a film that tried to play the ""socially relevant"" card to death. But the masterpiece flies over ""Frozen"" like a zeppelin over a fish bone."
36,The Wind Rises,5,30 April 2017,The Wind Rises,"I knew this was a film from the Japanese animation geniuses at Studio Ghibli, I didn't know it was based on a real story, to be honest though I mainly wanted to watch it because of its inclusion at the Oscars, directed by Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away). Basically it tells the true story of Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed Japanese fighter planes during World War II. As a young boy, Jirô (Zach Callison) dreamed of flying and designing beautiful aeroplanes, he was inspired by the famous Italian aeronautical designer Giovanni Battista Caproni (Stanley Tucci), he has a dream about meeting him. Unfortunately Jiro's nearsightedness from a young age prevented him from becoming a pilot, but in his dream, Caproni told him he never actually flew a plane in his life, and that building them is better. When he grows up, Jirô Horikoshi (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) joins a major Japanese engineering company and becomes one of the world's most innovative and accomplished aeroplane designers, including the design for the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The story sees him going through his own life, as well as experiencing historical events of the time, including the Great Kanto Earthquake, the Great Depression, the tuberculosis epidemic and Japan plunged into the Second World War. It also sees Jiro falling in love with Nahoko (Emily Blunt), who suffers tuberculosis and a lung haemorrhage, but eventually recovers and marries him, and it also sees his cherished friendship with his colleague Honjô (John Krasinski). Also starring Martin Short as Kurokawa, Mandy Patinkin as Hattori, Mae Whitman as Kayo Horikoshi, Jennifer Grey as Mrs. Kurokawa, William H. Macy as Satomi, Elijah Wood as Sone and Werner Herzog as Castorp. The stars doing the dubbed voices are all fine, there is no denying it is fantastic hand-drawn animation as usual, I'm not sure if going for a more realistic approach is right for the studio, we are more used to the fantasy stories with fantastical creatures, but it is just about interesting, an alright animated drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Worth watching!"
37,The Wind Rises,2,14 January 2017,Banal and not in a charming way,"Miyazaki is my absolute favorite director, so it especially hurt to be so disappointed by this, his supposedly last film. It's about a real person, a Japanese engineer who designed WWII fighter planes. Miyazaki loves his flying machines, and this guy, who was apparently opposed to the war, was a huge inspiration to him. But the movie is unbearably boring, and I think a big part of the problem was that it was based on a real person. I mean, a lot of Miyazaki's movies are relatively slow. Movies like Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service feel very pensive. But he's very inventive and imaginative, and you always get that he has something important to say, about the environment, or the importance of self-reliance, for example. But with this film, he was somewhat restricted to real events, and it just didn't feel as flexible or meaningful. He introduced this absolutely bizarre dream character in a series of dream sequences, and I HATE dream sequences. They made the film feel gimmicky rather than innovative."
38,The Wind Rises,8,21 June 2014,Mellow and sweet with stunning animation & funny sounds,"8.5 / 10 A pretty mellow film. Kind of slice-of-life. First five minutes were silent with no talking. Music was nice. Scenery animation was superb. Always makes you wanna go live in a little cottage house by the country side, surrounded by fields of grass rippling in the wind, clouds and sunshine all day round, etc.I liked the different languages introduced in the film, and sometimes you couldn't even understand it, but it didn't really feel like that mattered anyway. The Italian guy, Caproni, the German.. adds foreignness and artistry to the film.The plot is quite metaphorical and is about hardship, and you can see the title revolves around this. There was one line near the beginning, I think, in French, ""Le vent se lève, il faut tenter de vivre"" (The wind rises, one must try to live).I really enjoyed seeing the main character, Jiro, and Naoko together, but straight away the film tells you it's going to be bittersweet. If you asked a year or two ago, I'd have probably not cared as much. Maybe I'm just getting older haha.I watched the subbed version, although the dub didn't sound too bad actually. I found it kind of weird at the start when the film jumped a few years ahead in continuity and Jiro got older because his voice suddenly sounded very mature. I've heard the dub by Joseph Gordon Levitt was done much better though in that regard.There's a bit of silly and stubborn humour that plays well with some of the characters. I grinned during a few scenes.Good job Miyazaki, you have still managed to make me feel like I was off in another world for a little while.FUN FACT: All the of the sound effects in film were made using human sounds. So if you're planning on watching this, see if you can notice the distinct sound of airplane propellers spinning and revving, or the hissing of steam engines, earthquake noises.. all voiced by some person doing silly things with their mouth to produce those effects! I thought it was pretty funny while watching haha."
39,The Wind Rises,9,24 June 2014,An extraordinary film,"Studio Ghibli's 'The Wind Rises', is a powerful film. It manages to slowly inject the happenings under the viewer's skin with finesse. The pain felt by the characters at one point becomes very real, you can see the inevitable. But still you learn to hold on and stand your ground till the very end of the film. Do not mistake me. The film does not leave you feeling empty. It leaves you with a sense of elation. Rise form the sorrow, pull through the hardships and live. That's the end message of the film. A simple message, a simple story, but an extraordinary film. Miyazaki steps up his storytelling and once again very skillfully manages to reach out and touch many millions with his 'The Wind Rises'."
40,The Wind Rises,7,21 June 2014,a welcome addition to the collection (only just),"The Wind Rises has a lot of the same charm that has made Hayao Miyazaki's films so great, but although it is a good film on its own, it ultimately feels slightly shallow when placed amongst films like Spirited Away and Nausicaä: Valley of the Wind. It does not have the well-roundedness that these other films do and has less creative flourishes to bail it out. However it is still very entertaining and should definitely not be considered a bad film, indeed far from it.The film is about Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed fighter planes for Japan in the Second World War. The story is interesting, but ironically suffers from being too cut off from reality. This is something which would not normally be a problem in Miyazaki's films, which are able to leave the real world at whatever point they wish without any consequence. However, this film is too directly linked to the real world is too explicit in its reference to simply ignore it, which it does. It doesn't explore the morality of Jiro's inventions being used in the war enough, and this subject almost feels like an afterthought. Of course, this attitude does in part reflect his innocence in that he is simply an engineer who dreams to invent an aeroplane, but it becomes quite frustrating due to this being so close to the narrative and is simply driven past. Jiro is perhaps floating in the clouds like his inventions, which is acceptable, but does not stop it from being frustrating. He is never held accountable or really confronted very much by the idea that his planes are used for war. Whatever he is made aware of feels overly romanticised and cannot help but seem too far removed from the main plot.However, the films premise is still enough to adequately move the story forward, and there are many engaging passages in the film which really convey the sense of passion that Jiro has for his work. The dream sequences are interesting, and paint an interesting picture of how someone follows their ""dreams"", so to speak.The animation is very pretty and manages to hold the Studio Ghibli feel. Although it is slightly lacking in imagination compared to some past films, it is still gorgeous to look at.The film in a way suffers not unlike to what Howls Moving Castle suffered from. This is that the second half of the film feels slightly weaker because it is not able to juggle its ambitious ideas from the first half into a balanced conclusion. However Howls Moving Castle is a noticeably better film compared to The Wind Rises, perhaps because of its more imaginative animation and story which were able to excuse not having a perfect balance. The Wind Rises doesn't have this same luxury, and feels slightly isolated in some ways after a certain point in the film. In short, the scenes with the planes and the workers are very engaging, but the love interest weighs the film down a bit. It is an interesting premise the way Jiro and Nahoko meet but I always felt as though that part of the plot was always running its course in a too predictable way.Viewing the film on its own, without the shadow of Miyazaki's past work bearing down on it, the film looks quite a lot better and this is certainly a tribute to the quality of films Miyazaki has released in his long career. Yet the way this film was billed as his ""last film"" (although this now looks very unlikely) its inevitably going to be viewed alongside his other works. However, even though there are quite a large number of films better than this in the Miyazaki catalogue, it is still a welcome addition to the collection (only just).3.5/5 stars http://totellyouagain.blogspot.co.uk/"
41,The Wind Rises,9,19 June 2014,"Miyazaki's tribute to Jirô Horikoshi, and Tatsuo Hori. Less fantastical, and more fantastic.","Really great true story for once I was actually worried when I first saw the big round Totoro in Miyazaki's film company logo that this would be another little kids and magic fantasy adventure, but though the true Miyazaki style is evident, and there is a lot of time spent in dreams, and a possibly shared fantasy world; this movie still shines as a mostly true telling of the story of one of history's great aeronautics innovators. A truly touching story with beautiful and sometimes fantastical landscapes, and skies. The characters are all so alive, and the parts of the movie where Jirô is adventuring, and learning are a lot of fun. A movie trying to tell this same story would need to be almost entirely CG, so I am glad that Miyazaki chose this story to tell at this time. I really Enjoyed the love story that spans a generation, and many many miles, it touched me to see the two lost souls reunited at the ""magic mountain"". I recommend this to folks who normally shy away from animated movies, as a great historical look at Japan between WW1, and WW2, with their desire to build the most powerful weapons outweighing the needs of their people. Of course this is a sure recommend for anyone else out there as well the lovers of animation, the uber Miyazaki fans, and folks who just like to be told a great story, so add this one to your lists what ever form they take.Jesse of www.Jesse.ca"
42,The Wind Rises,9,8 January 2014,"I hold my breath, hoping and wishing the screen would pause at any moment to allow me time to admire the brush strokefilled landscapes.","I hold my breath, hoping and wishing the screen would pause at any moment to allow me time to admire the brush strokefilled landscapes. The camera pans across the stretch of a plane, diving into the distance and blowing glades of grass, with a fluffy clouded sky in the background. This is all easily confused with an acrylic painting.The Wind Rises (Kaze Tachinu) is Hayao Miyazaki's final film, and the only one he's solely directed and written since Ponyo (along with films like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke). It was released in Japan on July 20, 2013, and is to hit North American theatres February 21, 2014, although if you were lucky, you got to catch it at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival. Based on a manga of the same name, The Wind Rises tells the story of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter aircraft during WWII. However, the personal events in the film are completely fictional.Jiro's desire to make something beautiful was an inspiration to Miyazaki. Jiro's dedication to creating a revolutionary plane (for the war, or not) makes up most of the film. But the surprising love story about an unrelenting affection through sickness and health that takes over the second half of the movie is what tears at your insides and gets into that special spot inside of you, reserved only for the most touching stories.If you try to compare it to other Studio Ghibli films, The Wind Rises seems to be in its own category  neither like the fun and fantastical My Neighbour Totoro nor the futuristic Castle in the Sky. It's a more ""serious"" film, with tales of perseverance, the Second World War, and a heart-wrenching romance. That isn't to say Miyazaki doesn't imbue fantastical elements that allow the story to come alive in the limitless animated form, but this feature film is the realest story of Ghibli's I've come across, which helps to draw the viewer into this emotional tale.Jiro was an extremely lovable and understandable character. His age puts him apart from younger Ghibli heroes, which made the film feel more relatable than his others, despite the dreamy and surreal scenes Miyazaki included. More than ever, it's clear Miyazaki is at the peak of animation genius in this personal project, and with a film as stunning as this one, it seems a good place to retire.Overall, the end of the first half has its slow parts, but the film soon picks up with full drama in its second half. The animation is breathtaking, with characters delicately placed into scenes where each key frame could have been an artwork on its own. If you're not convinced, take a look at his water colour storyboards. Miyazaki's work in the world of animation will surely be missed."
43,The Wind Rises,6,28 November 2013,THE WIND RISES is an empty exercise in dishonest self-appraisal for animator Miyazaki.,"Art is personal. Creative self-expression is, by its very nature, a process of externalizing the internal. Many of your favorite movies, music records, and books were labors of love. But is there a point at which one's art can become too personal? Can dedication and focus breed myopia? In examining Hayao Miyazaki's latest film, I may have found the answer.THE WIND RISES tells a fictionalized account of the life of Jiro Horikoshi, the man responsible for designing Japan's infamous Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter airplane. The aircraft is known for its use during World War II, particularly in the attack on Pearl Harbor and in kamikaze missions. We begin with Jiro as a child in the early 20th century dreaming of flying machines and idolizing seminal figures in the then-young field of aeronautical engineering. Since poor sight will keep the young man from flying an airplane of his own, he attends university in the hopes of building them instead. Each act is ushered in with a scene featuring a strong gust of wind  a nice bit of theming with the title. The first reel contains some of the best pacing in Studio Ghibli's entire oeuvre. After that, the story throws on the brakes and crawls through a slight, clichéd recount of the man's endeavors up to just before the notorious event in Hawaii that brought the United States into the second World War.The movie is, as expected, an impressive visual outing by the legendary Studio Ghibli. The candy-coated look that has defined Miyazaki's work since 2001′s Spirited Away is on full display here. The interpretation of the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, in which the ground and everything upon it moves like violent ocean waves, is probably the most impressive scene in the picture from an animation perspective. In a departure from Miyazaki's usual fare, there are no cute, strange, or ugly creatures to break up the monotony of animated human beings, but the character designs are attractive and diverse enough to keep things interesting aesthetically.With the knowledge that Miyazaki is somewhat of an aviation fanatic (he has said as much himself), it's surprising how decidedly no-frills the flying sequences are. The two main types of flying scenes are test flights of Horikoshi's designs and dream sequences where he has conversations with famed aeronautical engineer Gianni Caproni. What we get in the test flight sequences are a lot of long wide shots, as though the audience is watching from the ground. The dreams on the other hand are mostly medium shots, two-shots, and close ups that don't really show off the aircraft that the characters are riding. The two most impressive of these scenes is a dream sequence that opens the flick and, somewhat ironically, a scene involving paper airplanes, but nothing quite as exhilarating is ever revisited. We've seen much better flying sequences from the animator in years past, such as in PORCO ROSSO, NAUSICAÄ OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, and CASTLE IN THE SKY.Joe Hisaishi has made a career for himself as a solo artist who happens to score Ghibli films and in doing so has composed some of the greatest scores of all time. The orchestrated soundtrack to this movie is simple in its melodies and assimilates into the emotional atmosphere of every scene. The vocal theme song is lovely but feels like it came out of a decade about halfway between the present and when the movie is set.An astute ear will notice something interesting that has been done with the foley effects. They are, by and large, created with human voices. Things like the mechanical locomotion of a train and the roaring ground during the aforementioned earthquake are given a special kind of vitality that I don't think I've ever experienced in a motion picture before.As Jiro dreams and draws and test flies his creations, we learn little more about the man behind the machine than we did at the title card. Horikoshi is reserved and zealous; this much is clear. A scene early on with his younger sister reveals that he is perhaps neglectful of his family in service of his aspirations. A poignant parallel can be drawn here to Miyazaki, who has been accused of allowing his work to detract from other aspects of his life. The animator even has Jiro smoke Cherry cigarettes, his own brand of choice. The scene with his sister is reflected later when she comes to visit Horikoshi as an adult and complains about his familial inattention yet again. Both scenes outline this character flaw in the engineer but are played for laughs as though 'little sister nags older brother because that's what little sisters do.' The filmmaker clearly admires and relates with his subject, but an abundance of adulation and a lack of honest self-appraisal weaken the core of his most personal work to date.After a couple of aeronautic failures and an exodus to pre-war Germany, our hero finds love. The adroit development of Horikoshi and Naoko Satomi's fictitious relationship is managed over just a couple of scenes, including one mentioned earlier featuring paper airplanes. This portion of the narrative is the most captivating of the picture and is a truly touching depiction of young love. However, the whole thing takes a not-so-surprising turn for the hackneyed when Naoko confesses that she has tuberculosis. I suppose the void of dramatic tension elsewhere in the story forced Hayao's hand, and out popped this done-to-death (pun intended) contrivance. His devotion to his sickly wife plays in contrast to earlier scenes with his younger sister, but because those scenes never cemented the necessary character flaw, the turnaround doesn't feel like much of a redemption.To read the rest of this review, please visit: http://tinyurl.com/l7tm7xu"
44,The Wind Rises,6,22 February 2014,disappointment,"I have to say this is really a disappointment to me. The story line is not clear at all and during the movie I wondered if there were some scenes cut because they just didn't add up. Why would Jiro always have dream and meet the Italian in his dream? I think this is what Hayao Miyazaki did on purpose. Let me explain.He wants to talk about Jiro's life. One remarkable chapter of this person's life was his invention of the Zero, which was the best aircraft of the time. It really kicked American asses for quite a while. So, if Hayao wants to recount Jiro's life events, Zero would be unavoidable. Then if he does so he would be accused of calling Japanese militarism, which antagonizes the Chinese and Korean very much. (Oh by the way this movie is not going to show in China, what a pity.) Or he could minimize the exposure of Zero on the scene, but that would leave a hole in his recount for sure. So Hayao faces this task that he has to give the Zero some exposure but not too much. The fact that he cannot bring a whole chunk of Zero related events to the movie(which are equally important to Jiro's biography and the movie's completeness) already makes the story line very thin, so he has to add in new character and plots---the Italian. So you see, Hayao's hands are tied because the topic he chose is very sensitive, this dooms the movie.I don't blame him for making such a flop, I just pity as this is his last piece of work. I do like his other movies though."
45,The Wind Rises,6,7 November 2014,The Wind Beneath the Wings of a Dead Bird,"Miyazaki's Swan Song was quite the discomforting experience. True, all the accolades given to this film regarding the lush Musical Score, the depth of the metaphors, and the lavished visual art/animation were absolutely deserved. It was honestly the film's saving grace, however the gold plated poop is still poop. True, there is something admirable about taking on a historical drama and to try to give 'real life' that Ghibli spark of magic, but this movie was just a gigantic portfolio of beautiful animation.The plot was as weak, consistently either underwhelming or anti- climactic, and worst of all ended ambiguously sad, so I left theaters habitually dissatisfied and depressed; The main character is both static and boring, I have no sympathy for this 'perfect man'. Any flaw that tried to give him edge or shape was almost immediately dismissed with some justifying action: ex. As a boy, he's painted as a scrawny, nerdy book worm, justified by confronting a bully and judo throwing him. Or he may be perceived as a neglectful lover/workaholic - whoops never mind, he holds his wife's hand while trying to work one handed."
46,The Wind Rises,8,31 March 2014,We must live!,"Hayao Miyazaki is a famous film director who has produced such acclaimed films as ""Spirited Away"", and ""Princess Mononoke."" I think many creators have been influenced by his fantastic worlds, and many audiences are moved by his heartwarming stories. Whilst it is unfortunate, The Wind Rises, his latest work, will be his last film.""The Wind Rises"" is completely different from his other films. It's based on a true story that took place in a tumultuous era encompassing he Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, the Great Depression, and the tuberculosis epidemic in Japan. It was a period of extreme poverty in Japan, and people struggled just to survive. The main character, Jiro, dreams of flying and designing beautiful airplanes, inspired by the famous Italian aeronautical designer, Caproni. He joins a major Japanese engineering company and becomes one of the most prominent and innovative aeronautical designers. During this time Jiro meets and falls in love with Nahoko. While Jiro works very hard to create sophisticated airplane designs as an engineer, he spends some fleeting moments with Nahoko who suffers from tuberculosis.Before I watched the movie, I wondered if people from outside of Japan would feel the same way that Japanese audiences do, whether they would sympathize with, or be offended by the story, because it focuses on the Japanese history and culture during the war. The story is about humans and engineers who seek ideal designs, rather than about patriotism or ideology. Therefore, people from all countries, young and old alike, will enjoy and be touched by how Jiro and Nahoko fall ever more deeply in love even though their time is limited. While Jiro works to design his ideal planes. I think he must have known that his planes were going to be used as killing machines, but as an engineer, he still wanted to create what he was able to imagine.I watched this film in Austin, Texas. When the credits rolled, some people in the audience applauded the film, expressing the realization that this was truly Miyazaki's last.Even though the story is great and there is much depth to the character, unfortunately, I felt it wasn't the best movie of Miyazaki. Still, it was worth seeing how he dealt with the challenge of this historical material. The message is strong and straightforward. He wanted to tell audiences to dream and look to the future."
47,The Wind Rises,10,21 March 2014,Miyazaki's Best Work,"After seeing the trailer for this movie, I had my doubts. I had seen reviews calling it Miyazaki's best film to date, but that is a high standard to set. I didn't expect what I saw. The story line was brilliant. It focuses on the life of Jiro, a man who loves planes and aviation but can't become a pilot because of his vision problems. His story is heartwarming and sad. The other characters are all as lovable as he is. Stidio Ghibli is known for it's breathtaking animation, and this film is no exception. The art is wonderful; the colors vibrant. It was one of the most visually beautiful films I have seen. The soundtrack is another work of art from Joe Hisaishi. I would recommend this film to any Ghibli fan, or anyone who appreciates animation. It is well worth your time. ""The wind is rising, we must try to live."""
48,The Wind Rises,9,16 March 2014,A classic adult animation from Ghibli Studio,"Sometimes an up-to-date CGI isn't necessarily needed to create a great cartoon. The Wind Rises proves a simple old-fashioned animation with grown-up and solid story could bring memorable impression. The movie is about a boy's dream on flight and building plane that pushed him to work hard on reaching his goal. Perhaps first an hour is quite monotone but still enjoyable to see. The Wind Rises is definitely different from Hayao Miyazaki's previous movies. It doesn't have a fantasy storyline or cute creature that has been a trademark on all of his movie. It's more like The Grave of Fireflies than Ponyo or The Spirited Away and could be quite complicated and uninteresting for children to see. In spite of that condition, The Wind Rises has it's own uniqueness that hardly to compare with his other film. It's classic and beautifully made, also the love story is surprisingly sweet. Too shame The Wind Rises wasn't appreciated as Best Animated Feature at Academy Awards this year."
49,The Wind Rises,10,4 March 2014,One of Miyasaki's best,"I'm really glad that there are out of the ordinary animated movies like The Wind Rises. Miyasaki executes wonderfully, showing how this medium strong fortes are put to good use to show why mature and wonderful stories can be best made by carefully made animations that create scenes with no artistic limits. Again, animation is not only for comedy and over exaggeration of character traits or action, is also about using techniques to tell a better narrative.Every detail in The Wind Rises, even if it comes from a random character that it's just walking on street feels way more organic and conveys much more storytelling that most movies made. The way the people just dodge the train already narrates you the culture and attitude of an early 1900's japan. Not to say that even a engineering task made by the protagonist are filled with excitement. Attention to detail it's always present on Ghibli movies, and this it's no exception.And of course, the main story never diverts from the protagonist and always follows him, through what basically will become the most important part of his life, and a wonderful tale on following your dreams with tenacity and enjoyment, but also on how people can be joined to produce things that are way more than the sum of it's parts.If you live in the US, go and watch it, enjoy, just relax, read every careful detail that the movie shows you, foreground and background, and at the same time support a movie where your intelligence never gets insulted and your emotion sync up perfectly with the tale. Truly a master piece. Hope movies like this never run out."
50,The Wind Rises,8,28 December 2017,Amazing beauty,"Written and directed by Japanese maestro Hayao Miyazaki, ""The Wind Rises"" (2013), based on Miyazaki's manga, is his eleventh feature film. There's an almost ungraspable beauty to the animations and the story is an inspiring and heartwarming one./Mårten Larsson"
51,The Wind Rises,9,17 November 2017,A film that can easily touch you,"The Wind Rises is an amazing movie about the life and carrier of Jiro Horikoshi. Jiro wanted to be an aeronautical engineer ever since he was a young boy and worked hard in order to make airplanes like the ones in his dreams. the movie uses close ups and long shots when we see the planes in air in order to show the audience how close, yet far away jiros dream is. Jiros conflict with him wanting to make airplanes that are not used as weapons and the reality that he must make fighter planes for the military or he could never make planes, creates a beautifully tragic light that jiro stars in. The romantic sub plot is also good with how jiro has to sacrifice the happy life he could have with a family for his dream to make planes. At the end of the film you see Jiro looking back at his career just as Giovanni Battista Caproni does in the beginning of the movie. This demonstrates the cycle of innovation and war going hand in hand slightly. Most movies can't touch me on an emotional level with their themes and yet this one did. I could really sympathize with the main character and somewhat feel his struggle."
52,The Wind Rises,,12 November 2017,"Interesting and visually impressive, but lacking heart and rushes the emotional element (mild suggestive spoilers)","The brand is so strong with Ghibli, and the name of Miyazaki generally means great work  even to something without any real knowledge or interest in Japanese animation per se; so there is an expectation that each film will soar. With The Wind Rises, the critics all seemed to suggest it was an instant classic, but mostly I tried to avoid reviews and hype, and did not watch in a rush. The plot follows the key moments in the life of Jiro Horikoshi, who designed Japanese fighter planes during World War II. We join him as a student and follow his career through romance and flights of fancy which inspire his work.Visually it is as pretty as ever, with the real life providing plenty of detail, and the dream sequences having lots of energy and creativity. However, these aspects contrast quite badly with the majority of the content, which is interesting  but no more than this. The narrative plays out in a very functional way. The purpose of the dream sequences seem to be almost an attempt to liven up the story, and the romance elements seem exaggerated to introduce a heart that isn't in the majority of the telling. There are efforts at color and humor, and most of it does add to the film in a way that makes it more lively than it may otherwise have been. Problem is that the core of the film isn't this way, either in the detail or the character.Jiro is mostly a dull character, particularly after the youthful spirit of the first third settles down. I did not connect with him, his work, or his sacrifice  and the final scenes did nothing for me as a result. The content of the film also seems off, because it is not just one of invention and passion, but rather the spirit of the war effort is behind. There are some mentions to this, but that inherent darkness only seems to be dealt with in mentions rather than what it really deserved. I guess this is a balancing act and an awkward aspect  I'm not sure how best it could have been handled beyond the muted presence, but it struck me as oddly present but not present throughout.Worth a look for the basic story and the animation, but mostly it is a functional piece which surprised me by lacking heart and not drawing me in emotionally."
53,The Wind Rises,10,5 November 2017,One of Miyzaki's Best,"Miyzaki's films are famous the world over for their use of quirky fantasy elements, breathtaking animation tactics and environmental themes. It's all well and good to spread a strong message against consumerism and pollution and all that with cutesy little animals and children, but I personally find that his most effective pictures are the ones grounded in reality.Of course, for the main character of The Wind Rises, he prefers not to be grounded in reality, and he has some pretty trippy dreams sometimes about building a spectacular aircraft, but in the meantime he's studying to be an aeronautical engineer. Jiro has imagined all his life that he'll work with planes, and his friend Caproni, an Italian engineer who visits him in his dreams, guides him to designing planes instead of flying them because of his poor vision. Jiro gets employed by Mitsubishi, and throughout the film he meets many incredible friends, from his dwarfish boss with a bad temper, to a Soviet spy who fled Germany because he disapproves of Hitler's cruel tactics and the actions of the Nazis. He also meets Nahoko, a young girl with tuberculosis who later becomes his devoted wife. Unfortunately the war soon collides with Jiro's dreams, resulting in his designs being used for horror rather than peace.I've heard many complaints about this film, specifically that it doesn't address Jiro in a more negative light for designing the planes in the first place. Because Studio Ghibli creates films targeted mostly towards children at this point though, I'd hardly think it appropriate for the production company to be showing fully the diabolical madness of WWII or Japan's treatment of China at the time. Did Jiro ever want his plane designs used for evil? I highly doubt that was the man's intention, although he was very naive. Weren't most people? WWII was hell on earth back then, and nobody wanted to think the worst of each other. Miyzaki tackles a touchy subject very effectively, sharing with viewers that yes, this did happen, but instead of creating a graphic and gory war film and focusing purely on Kamikaze suicide missions, he shares the life of an engineer with a dream, using nostalgic piano melodies and Italian-esque accordion tunes to set the scene, as well as colourful animation techniques that don't rely too heavily on fancy effects to be good. Like his earlier ""Grave of the Fireflies"", this film is real and incredible, without trying to inject any preachy messages about humanity destroying the earth. It's about real people, and after a while the characters all start to feel almost like old friends."
54,The Wind Rises,9,24 August 2017,An extraordinarily beautiful and adult story from Miyazaki.,"""The Wind Rises"" is a highly fictionalized version of the early years of aeronautical engineers Jiro Hirokoshi and Tatsuo Hori...with a very strong emphasis on Jiro. The fact Hiyao Miyazaki would make such a film isn't all that surprising, since he seemed to have a real sentimental attitude towards early airplanes in several of his films (such as ""Porco Rosso""). However, I was a bit surprised when I learned about the film since the planes these two men made for Mitsubishi were important components of the extremely nationalistic Japanese military of the 1930s and 40s...an era many would probably choose to forget.Not surprisingly, this is a Miyazaki film that is not at all intended for children. In fact, I wouldn't bother showing it to your younger audiences...they'd be bored. Plus some parents would object to all the smoking and cursing...and there's not a single Totoro or flying witch to be seen! As for me, I understand that many Japanese animated films are NOT intended for kids and that isn't a bad thing at all. In this case, Studio Ghibli managed to make one of the loveliest of all their films in ""The Wind Rises"". It is extremely touching in parts, especially when dealing with Jiro's fated romance. In fact, the film practically screams quality throughout and it's not at all surprising that it was nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar. Well worth seeing.Incidentally, Jiro's infamous Japanese Zero was interesting because by the end of the war almost every single one of these aircraft had been destroyed...and I wonder how he felt about this. Ironically, one of the few Zeros to survive did so because it was captured and taken to the States for testing and evaluation."
55,The Wind Rises,9,5 April 2017,"Dream & Reality, dreams & nightmares","As I child I watch about 20 times the marvelous movie Spirited Away. For two years, I started to get interested in cinema so that to watch all the masterpieces the cinema has to offer. Thus, it was time to watch all of the brilliant Japanese director's movies.The Wind Rises is just astonishing and differs a lot about all that Miyazaki did before. This movie is much more realistic than Miyazaki previous works. Obviously, every single movie presents different characteristics (My Neigbor Totoro is more childish for example) but the main point is often Man's position on Earth or the Universe. In The Wind Rises, Miyazaki deals with the position of Man in his own life and our relation with our dreams.The topics which provide to the movie a very realistic aspect are quite hard: Natural disaster, Disease, War... Nevertheless, Miyazaki superbly brings to light Dreams and Humanity through lovely characters (Jiro, Caproni, Naoko, Honjo, Castorp, Kurokawa).""Le Vent se lève... il faut tenter de vivre""Thanks Hayao Miyazaki"
56,The Wind Rises,8,28 January 2017,How awesome is this animation.,"...And the story is so excellent it could have been a live action film Studio Ghibli at it's best and animation at it's best. how did the Oscars pass up on this for the win!? Plus I'm showing favoritism as the movie is about one of my favorite subjects, Aviation.Somewhere in-between The Great War and World War II lies Jiro, a young Japanese man who becomes a fan of an Italian airplane designer and shares his dream (Literately in the sense of the movie) of designing air crafts, and the movie goes through his process, as well as him finding love.I don't know if this is a true story or how inspired by true events the movie is, but the Zero fighter that Jiro designs was used by the Japanese in World War 2. I do know the title comes form a poem. The Wind Rises, what a perfect title for a movie about Aviation.Anyway, The Wind Rises is like a painting in movement. the complete extension of what I want from animation. There was one scene in which Japan suffered an earthquake and with animation, they intensified the scene making it look like the ground just had a hiccup and caused all this chaos and destruction. it was brilliant.So I'm sorry, as good as Frozen is I think the Oscars made the wrong choice in not given the Wind Rises the trophy."
57,The Wind Rises,8,22 October 2016,beauty and sadness,"Jiro Horikoshi is a young boy who dreams of flying machines. In 1918, he's given a magazine and he starts admiring Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Battista Caproni. Caproni would be in his dreams as he works to design advanced planes. There is a massive earthquake and subsequent fires which devastates Tokyo. Jiro helps Nahoko and her mother. Banks are closing and the economy is collapsing. Kids are starving but Jiro gets a job at aircraft manufacturer Mitsubishi with his friend Honjo. When their plane Falcon is rejected, they are sent to Germany to study Junkers' designs. They return to Japan to produce the most advanced fighters in the world for the military despite being behind and much poorer than Germany. There are the secret police and the mysterious anti-war Castorp. Jiro would meet again the love of his life Nahoko.The great filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki returns to deliver the fictionalized historical biopic of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the Zero. There is a simple beauty and an ever-present sadness to this movie. I didn't know the subject of this movie but it becomes obvious that the timeline is converging on a delicate era. It fills the movie with a sense of inevitable doom."
58,The Wind Rises,6,20 September 2016,its plain and beautiful,"Who don't love Ghibli movies? Every anime movie lover all around the world love them. For me, the best Ghibli movie that I ever watched is ""Grave of the Fireflies"" (1988). Its really good and heartbreaking. I cried a lot with that movie. Although there is some bump in their way with their recently ""bad"" movie in my opinion like ""When Marnie Was There"" (2014), ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" (2011) and ""Tales from Earthsea"" (2006). From my honest opinion, from all 21 Ghibli film, just 4 don't really works on me. Its still good, a lot of people praise them except for the ""Tales from Earthsea"" (2006). I think in this new age, Ghibli wants to try some heavy drama stuff. That's what they keep making this serious stuff like Marnie and this Jiro Horikoshi biopic. But, I think the genre that Ghibli is really good at is children movie, family,fantasy, fun and all. I never said that ""The Wind Rises"" is bad but its quite boring sometime and I think the thing that save this movie is his love story, background music, gorgeous animation and its ending. It does make me cry a bit too. Other than that, when they talk about the plane, engineer and everything, its looks like out of place and uninteresting. It will be really suit for live action movie, but not for anime, its really heavy for anyone who just want to enjoy some Ghibli fun time. Similar stuff happen with Marnie too. Nevertheless, Ghibli is still the best and I hope they can come up with best work of their ""genre"", again. Maybe the sequel of Ponyo will be nice I guess."
59,The Wind Rises,8,12 August 2016,The Wind Rises: A Magical Film,"Hayao Miyazaki had made many magical, fascinating animated motion pictures in his lifetime with Studio Ghibli. Some of these fantasy films include Spirited Away, Ponyo, My Neighbor Totoro, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, and The Cat Returns. His last film, The Wind Rises, was recently released, and is like none of his previous animations. In the other movies, the characters are set in a bizarre, surreal, magnificent world on an unusual mission. In The Wind Rises, however, there is no unseen, amazing world. Rather, the story is set in Japan, and it revolves around an airplane designer, Jiro Horikoshi. What Miyazaki does to bring the story to life is focus and discover the beauty in times most people don't see beauty. For example, work can be drudgery and an annoying aspect of life. However, Miyazaki sees work as a time of inspiration and an opportunity to display one's skills. The rain can be gross and make one feel dank, but Miyazaki sees it as a beautiful experience and an opportunity to hold close to a loved one under a small umbrella. By focusing on the different views, Miyasaki had made The Wind Rises just as enchanting as his surreal animations. The Wind Rises is extremely captivating in animation and thought. The story was based on true events, so it was realistic, yet it shows that life can be fantastic when looked at in the right perspective. In this picture, Jiro Horikoshi has vivid dreams of designing airplanes throughout his life. Along his journey, he faces a devastating Japanese earthquake and later meets his soul mate, who was dying. In the end, Jiro builds the ""Zero"" jet, later reminiscing about the creation and speaking sadly by the thousands of deaths caused by the ""Zero"" planes in the military. This film elicits giggles, smiles, and tears, getting to the hearts of the people."
60,The Wind Rises,10,8 August 2016,"The Wind Rises, and yet the Sun sets on a master of animation...","2013's ""The Wind Rises"" is a magnificent piece of Japanese animation, or Anime' (for the uninitiated). In what may be one of the rare films of this type, ""The Wind Rises"" is a unique mix of biopic, historical drama, romance, and fantasy. It tells the story of an enthusiastic dreamer who is able to realize many of his life's greatest ambitions, but unfortunately lives to see his genius and the fruits of his labor later give way to a dawning nightmare.Thankfully, although the film doesn't descend into pointless political arguments and finger-pointing and questioning the morality of its lead character, ""The Wind Rises"" does recognize that its central protagonist can feel the winds of change upon him and the moral conflict he will eventually find himself in.""The Wind Rises"" is, of course, the final film of legendary Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki - who wrote and directed the film, which was partially inspired by the 1937 short story ""The Wind Has Risen"" by Tatsuo Hori and which Miyazaki then adapted into a Manga series - who retired from filmmaking in September of 2013. ""The Wind Rises"" didn't hit American shores until February of the following year; I had plans to see the film in the theaters, but I unfortunately never got the opportunity. Two years later, I finally got the chance to sit down and watch this fantastical masterpiece of Japanese Anime'.The film is different from his past masterworks like ""Spirited Away"" (2001) (my personal favorite Miyazaki film ever), ""Princess Mononoke"" (1997) or his last film before this one, ""Ponyo"" (2008). While there is fantasy here, it's mixed in with Japanese history, which may turn away some young viewers and anyone still accustomed to his usual fantasy work. But it's still a brilliant exercise in animated storytelling.And yet, despite its brilliance, this film did cause a controversy in its native Japan, due to its subject matter - the late Japanese aeronautical engineer Dr. Jiro Horikoshi (June 22, 1903-January 11, 1982), who, of course, was the man who designed and built the much-feared Mitsubishi A6M Zero attack fighter plane, which was used by Japanese kamikaze pilots in World War II. Miyazaki was attacked by the political Right AND Left in Japan for making a film that supposedly glorified war - which does not look good for a nation that is still dealing with the physical and psychological traumas of its wartime aggression and brutality against its enemies 71 years after that war's official conclusion - as well as negative comments he'd made about attempts to revise Japan's 1947 Allied-drafted, post-WWII pacifist constitution.Miyazaki, of course, is an out-spoken pacifist who condemned his country's actions during World War II (even though Miyazaki was only four-years-old at the time of Japan's surrender in 1945). His film does not glorify war, but it does nonetheless take a very sympathetic view of a complex individual, one who was morally opposed to war and objected to his work being misused for such destructive purposes - as tools of war - but was ultimately powerless to do anything about the reckless and foolish, self-destructive actions of his government and military. But like I said earlier, Miyazaki's film is not a political statement, but a heartfelt portrait of a man striving to live his dreams and create art - which sort of mirrors the fact that ""The Wind Rises"" was a dream project of Miyazaki himself, who has been a warplane enthusiast since childhood and whose father's company made rudders for the Zero attack fighters during the war.Idealistic and driven, Jiro Horikoshi (voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the English-language version) just wants to design and build airplanes, since his nearsightedness dashes his dreams of ever becoming a pilot. With his close friend Hiro Konjo (voiced by John Krasinski), they set to work building planes to be used by the Japanese Imperial Navy. Jiro's life and work are inter-cut with dreams of his hero, Italian aeronautical engineer Count Giovanni Battista Caproni (voiced by Stanley Tucci), who states that he has never flown a plane in his life, but building them is much better than actually flying them. (Caproni also ominously states that his planes are being used by the military for war purposes, and that many of these planes and their pilots will never come back from their missions.)Jiro's professional achievements are mirrored by the love and support of his one true love, Nahoko Satomi (voiced by Emily Blunt), whom he first meets in the aftermath of the great 1923 Kanto Earthquake, which devastated Japan and had a terrible effect on its already-struggling economy.""The Wind Rises"" is a fantastic animated film that treats its subject matter with dignity and respect. Like I stated earlier, the film never becomes political, but nonetheless it's filled with foreboding with major events in world history about to unfold. Even for me while watching it, the characters can see that a great change is coming just over the horizon, and for those of us that know world history, Miyazaki places a number of omens in ""The Wind Rises"" to show that in just a few short years a great and terrible calamity is about to befall the people of Japan (and the rest of the world, for that matter) - World War II.If ""The Wind Rises"" truly is the last masterpiece of Hayao Miyazaki, I honestly cannot think of a greater send-off to a living legend. This had all the earmarks of the last work of a master filmmaker and animator - perhaps the ultimate culmination of over four decades of one critically acclaimed animated feature after another.10/10P.S.: The 1973 song ""Hikoki-Gumo"" by Yumi Arai, which is featured prominently in the film and theatrical trailer, is simply amazing!""All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful"" - Dr. Jiro Horikoshi"
61,The Wind Rises,8,23 June 2016,A fitting retirement piece for the legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki,"The Wind Rises is an anime film by Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki's final movie as a writer/director. I found it to be very touching and poignant, as to be expected from anything by Studio Ghibli and the animation was, as always, breathtaking. While it's not my favourite of Miyazaki's movies, it's certainly one of his most beautiful to look at.The film is a fictionalised biopic about Jiro Horikoshi, designer of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter aircraft used by the Japanese during World War II. Since he was a child, Jiro had dreamed of being a fighter pilot, but due to his poor eyesight he was unable to follow through on it. After reading a magazine on aviation, he becomes interested in designing aircraft when he dreams one night that he meets the famous Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Battista Caproni, who tells him that it is better to build planes rather than flying them. As a result, Jiro then vows to become an aircraft engineer.Like with every Studio Ghibli film, there's a certain hard-to-describe artistic beauty about this movie. A lot of time and effort has gone into telling this story and it definitely shows. It is a fitting retirement piece for the legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki.I rate it 8/10 and would definitely recommend it to any fan of Studio Ghibli and fans of animation in general."
62,The Wind Rises,10,8 June 2016,The Wind Rises,"This film, Hayao Miyazaki's last, tells a fictionalised account of the life of the aircraft designer Jiro Horikoshi. From a young age Jiro dreams of flying although his poor eyesight means he will never be a pilot. After reading a magazine article he dreams of meeting Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Battista Caproni; after this he decides to pursue a career in aircraft design. As he travels to college by train he is caught up in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. On the train he meets Naoko and after the earthquake he helps her and her injured maid. After graduating he finds work at Mitsubishi and it is clear that Japanese aircraft design is far behind that of the west but he and his friend Kiro Honjo are determined to help them catch up. After an early setback Jiro takes some time off and bumps into Naoko again and a romance soon blossoms. She tells him that she has tuberculosis but after some time in a sanatorium they are married. He continues to work and makes great advances there are storm clouds on the horizon though; Japan is on the road to war and Jiro's planes are destined to play a key part in that self-created national disaster.I had put off watching this film for a long time as I didn't want there to be no new Miyazaki films to watch; having finally watched it I can say it was not in any way disappointing. This is Miyazaki's most grown up work and it doesn't shy away from tragedy; either personal of national. As one would expect from Studio Ghibli the animation is amazing. There are no static background characters; everybody is moving in a vibrant but not overly exaggerated manner. Not surprisingly the flying scenes are beautiful. The characters are interesting as are their stories; the fact that many items of Jiro's life as depicted in the film don't match reality doesn't matter as it doesn't claim to be a true record of what happened. This is one of Ghibli's more emotional films; only Isao Takahata's 'Grave of the Fireflies' is sadder at the end as this story doesn't shy away from showing the consequences of Jiro's aircraft designs or give us a happy ending to Naoko's story. Overall I'd say this was a great film; it might not have the universal appeal as Mayazaki's other films but it is a must see for older fans of his work and a fitting farewell to this master animator."
63,The Wind Rises,7,30 March 2016,Artistically masterful,"My expectations made this film a little less thrilling than it might have been; still I am pleased to have seen it.Jiro, a plane designer, lives a rather mundane and ordinary life. He dreams of becoming a creator of planes, and takes inspiration from those before him. The Wind Rises captures the will and person of Jiro as he learns what it means to be an artist of planes. Characters in this movie are sparse and mostly undeveloped, but they are still endearing and easy to understand. I watched the English dubbed version of the movie and so some of the acting was (I know it can't be helped) a little offsetting. It was tolerable. I can say i grew attached to the simple characters whose role was not so much to describe certain people but to characterize certain attitudes about the history and culture. Perhaps I watched this movie hoping for more permanent, particular people, but I understand that the movie did not serve to show them in that way.The most incredible part of the film was the artistic choices Miyazaki dared to make. I didn't like the movie too much because it was slow and very quiet-- this however creates an effect much like the wind. The wind heavily influences the flow and dynamic of the piece, and so it became a canvas moved by the delicate hands of life. What I wanted to see in this movie, however, was a little more depth of narrative. The movie is not for those who come to see a mentally riveting production, and I think that is perfectly fine. The point of the movie is to posit a historical piece of information, and like all history, lay down a thesis of life. Life is passing, quick, and cannot be seen so much as it has to be felt. But we know when we feel it.Miyazaki's ""The Wind Rises"" is a diligent piece of art."
64,The Wind Rises,9,27 February 2016,A poignant goodbye from Miyazaki,"The film is an interesting melange of Japanese literature, culture and history. It will also disappoint many of Miyazaki's fantasy fans, as this is a biographical movie. In truth, it is based on two different works, one is the diary of the aeronautical engineer who designed the famous Japanese Zero fighter, and the other is a story of two girls in a tuberculosis sanatorium (in truth, Jiro's wife did not have TBC).Yet the details capture also some of the things closer to Miyazaki's heart: a commentary on the current state of Japan, a hopeful dream for a person who is losing his sight and his passion for flying and for kind independent young women. All in all it might feel a little dry sometimes, but only until you understand that the source material was a diary that has 80% of it containing aeronautical design ideas and calculations.Perhaps a two hour film about a quiet dreamer of plane designs is not what I would have chosen for Miyazaki's last animation movie, but it wasn't my choice after all. While his artistic expression cannot be stopped - he is still drawing manga and doing other stuff - he publicly announced that this would be his last film, the reason being his worsening eyesight. Considering the first scene of the movie is of a myopic boy who dreams of flying a plane and then crashing because he can't see well, I would say that's a pretty direct statement from the genius animator.It doesn't matter if I recommend this movie or not. If you are a fan of Ghibli and Miyazaki you will watch it anyway, while if you are not, you can try some other stuff of his, become a die hard fan, and find yourself in a situation already solved previously (that's engineering humor, BTW)"
65,The Wind Rises,8,16 December 2015,"Engrossing, one of Miyazaki's Best","*Warning- Spoilers* Where to start. The seemingly effortless animation, the trademark Studio Ghibli expressions and style, the side characters (i.e. Jiro's boss, Mr. Kurokawa) so full of life, the background characters who genuinely seem to have personalities of their own, the juxtaposition of classical music with the destruction of Japan, the character study of an altruistic, idealistic man who sees his efforts ultimately go up in flames- The Wind Rises doesn't fit neatly in the typical three act structure of most films, yet despite this lack of the usual narrative arc, it's completely engrossing from start to finish. Though I would still rank Spirited Away as Miyazaki's crowning achievement, this film is, in a way, in a different category from Spirited Away, and many of the other Ghibli movies, for that matter. It lacks any blatantly fantastical character and because of this deals with mature themes such as regret and moral ambiguity in a way that feels much more piercing.That final scene is an unbelievable mix of tragedy and optimism. It's implied that Japan is in ruins thanks to Jiro's work, his wife has succumbed to tuberculosis, and the 10 best years of Jiro's life are behind him. Yet ""live,"" Jiro's deceased wife urges him. And so he does, joining his Italian hero for drinks."
66,The Wind Rises,10,21 October 2015,A very interesting and the best sad anime film I've ever seen!,"This movie is absolutely stunning! I was watching this film just yesterday as I was off college due to having a bad cold. It really made me forget about my Cold and made me concentrated more on the film itself! The design of the planes were absolutely beautifully drawn, as if they were made for real even though, I know well its a cartoon but at the same time, you really wouldn't think of it being cartoony at all! Everything looked so real!Although I was so pleased with this film, I found it so sad that Nahoko and Jiro didn't stay together in the end as she was very much dying from Tuberculosis. It is a bit of a tearjerker really because it is like a silent killer as well as with cancer. The only difference that it does is the blood is shown but with cancer, it isn't showing.I really loved this movie, definitely deserved an Oscar!"
67,The Wind Rises,7,5 July 2015,A soaring tale of hope and despair,"The Wind Rises is the second movie I have now watched from legendary filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki and I gotta say I'm starting to understand the praise. This film was incredibly beautiful and had me very much invested in it. The story of Jirô Horikoshi is one of tragic irony. He dreams of making groundbreaking aircraft that will ultimately be expendable by the effects of a terrible war. As far as story elements go, The Wind Rises is as good as any movie I've seen with wonderful characters and an enticing story. The animation is also quite brilliant with the movie really shining as a work of art. After Castle In The Sky, I can honestly say I look forward to seeing other Miyazaki efforts and hope they entertain me as much as these ones have.Rating: 8/10"
68,The Wind Rises,8,30 May 2015,Emotional Subtlety,"The end credits song of this movie (i.e. subtitled) really got to me after seeing this very beautiful masterpiece. It is as much about life as I've ever seen in a movie, yet it is very magical in making you feel you are there too, seeing how beautiful life can be. I don't know exactly which feeling it is that the theme song made me feel, but I think it is about the fragile happiness: it is the dreamy joy of a 4-year old, subtly combined with the sadness he dealt with. The movie is quite slow, very polite and the majority of it is only semi-interesting. But the last scene with Caproni made me appreciate it a lot for being able to show me something, not larger-than-life, but exactly as large as life. It made me see the emotional subtlety that was put in the movie all along, the beauty and the fragility, and the moving on... 'Cause, you know, the film's title is mostly a metaphor for the line that follows it, and a quote for the end of life in anime movies: the wind rises;.. and we must try to live. Thank you, Miyazaki, a perfect ending."
69,The Wind Rises,,10 April 2015,Hayao Miyazaki's Swan Song Is Also His Most Emotional Film To Date.,"From the mastermind behind anime classics like My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke & Spirited Away, The Wind Rises is possibly the final feature film in the glorious film career of the greatest animator of all time whose contribution to this medium has been so profound, influential & immense that the world of cinema, art & culture will forever be indebted to his works.Set in pre-World War II Japan, The Wind Rises is a fictional biography of Jiro Horikoshi; the chief engineer of many fighter planes that were used by the Japanese militia during the war. The plot covers his rise from an ambitious dreamer to one of the most innovative designers of airplanes, and through his life story also covers many events that had significant effects on Japanese infrastructure.Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, The Wind Rises is his eleventh & final feature-length film and although it may not be as magical as his most memorable works, it's undoubtedly his most emotional film to date. Appealing more to adults than children, The Wind Rises exquisitely showcases the entire futility of war & how some of the most beautiful creations by mankind was used for their very own destruction.One of Miyazaki's rare films to not feature a female protagonist, The Wind Rises still brims with most of his trademarks and is a delightful nod to aviation, ambition & dream pursuits. The hand-drawn animation is absolutely jaw-dropping to look at for it is extremely detailed, seamlessly rendered & highly realistic in its depiction. Camera-work is brilliantly carried out as well while the editing lets the plot breathe & progress at its own set pace.It's not really difficult to see why The Wind Rises may alienate few Miyazaki fans for it lacks that childlike sense of wonder that has defined every single one of his works, thus making them appeal equally to viewers of all ages. The tone here is much serious, the elements of fantasy as well as pleasant attempts at humour is sorely missing & the narrative as a whole is sentimental, heartbreaking & even emotionally scarring to a considerable extent.On an overall scale, The Wind Rises is another quality addition to a legendary film career that arguably has no equals. This is one rare filmmaker who never actually made a bad film for every single work by him has been a truly magical ride that left me dazzled, entertained & satisfied. His swan song is more or less bittersweet in taste but it is nonetheless fitting for the legend who, in a career spanning half a century, showed us the vast potential of what creative imagination can accomplish & for that alone, he deserves to end his journey on his own terms. And he does!Thank you, for the memories."
70,The Wind Rises,7,10 April 2015,A flight of fantasy,"Version I saw: UK cinema release (subtitled)Actors: 6/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10The Wind Rises has been said to be Hayao Miyazaki's last film and, whether or not it turns out to be true, it is almost certainly his most personal. It takes the love he put into Porco Rosso for early 20th century aviation and brings it on a step, covering aviation engineering, a subject lacking in adventure, even if it does have a certain romance.The Zero fighter invented by the film's main character Jiro Horikoshi is a touchstone of Japanese culture which, I maintain, has had a greater impact on them than is often realized. However, its position in the center of this film has caused controversy because it raises the spectre of Japan's ignominious World War II record. Their flat refusal to acknowledge abuses like their treatment of prisoners of war has soured international relations for decades, and stubbornly glamorizing the War is a typical thing for them to do.However, while The Wind Rises does not exactly tackle these issues head-on, I was satisfied by how it deflected them. This is not a film about a machine of death, it is about the romance of flight, the joy of fantasy and how people are willing to endure hard work and repeated failure to follow their dreams.To this end, the inclusion of famed director Hideaki Anno as the voice of Jiro is a surprising but salutary one. Anno is something of an anime legend in his own right, but a more esoteric one. I compare it to David Lynch starring in a Martin Scorsese film. Anno's voice is perfect for this role though: no heroic baritone but thin, reedy, nerdy. The Wind Rises is about a high-minded dreamer, and the surprising nobility which emerges from that. I just hope others realize this as I did."
71,The Wind Rises,9,1 April 2015,Beautiful in every aspect.,"The Wind Rises is perhaps the best animated film of all time. It is beautiful, intelligent, and thoroughly unexpected. The Wind Rises is a biopic based on the life of Jiro Horikoshi, a Japanese engineer in World War II. It follows him throughout his life, showing him first as a brilliant young boy obsessed with the beauty of planes, then as a young man set on designing and creating them. The film is complex and multi-layered in its description of Jiro's character. He seems to be a tortured artist at times, dealing with the ever-present threat of failure, but at other times he is a reluctant engineer, a tool of the Japanese government used to create weapons of war. Legendary director Hayao Miyazaki maneuvers around his complex character with a perfect smoothness that allows the whole story to fit together and to make sense. As the film progresses, we understand Jiro as a person, as a true human being.Beauty in film is a rare thing. Visual beauty, of course, is not. We are constantly exposed to fantastic landscapes, each holding its own special, intricate beauty, leaving us marveling at the seemingly boundless extent of the human imagination. But all-around beauty, beauty in theme, character, dialogue, story, plot, emotion as well as visual beauty is very sparingly achieved in film. We are constantly exposed to visual masterpieces that sacrifice plot and even coherence for awe-inspiring visuals. But The Wind Rises is a special film. It achieves this beauty, almost perfectly. The animation is as beautiful as the plot itself. The film relentlessly tugs at your heart, whether by its beautifully animated landscapes or its wonderful, striking, and heartrending plot.Goodbye, Mr. Miyazaki. We will miss you."
72,The Wind Rises,8,28 February 2015,A creative tribute to Japan's visionary aviation engineer,"When we want to give a tribute, we usually want it to be something memorable. In the case of Miyazaki, this tribute is telling a creative story that transcends reality. This happens to be a story about Japan's visionary engineer of aviation. His dream was to ride the wind. Although he couldn't be a pilot, his poor eyesight did not hinder him from pursuing this dream. This led him to design airplanes instead, with the aim of bringing any ordinary person to experience traveling in the sky. But in his time, planes were not made to pursue this dream but rather they were made to bring destruction. We might expect that this tribute would be in a form of an accurate account of Jiro Hirokoshi's life, but since this was helmed by a visionary artist, the result was rather an imaginative depiction of the protagonist's life.Just like Miyazaki's previous work, the storytelling is engrossing, and we are in for a visual treat. The difference, however, is that we no longer have the essence of a fairy tale on the same level as that of Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. The film was more serious, and it actually ended with a tragic tone, although it is far from the depressing mood of Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies. This is Miyazaki in his more introspective side about dealing with social issues such as war. You may also observe that more weight is given to the dialogue for the story's progression, and we even have a dose of politics involving Germany and Japan together with the technicalities about aircraft design. Unlike, Howl's Moving Castle, the film is evenly paced, but when compared to My Neighbor Totoro, the visuals are given less opportunity to breath. Although the film is rather inaccurate as a biopic, the story about Hirokoshi's love interest made the film more compelling. The accuracy is beside the point though because what we are really witnessing is Miyazaki's vision, his very own tribute to Hirokoshi (and as the end credits say, it is also a tribute to Tatsuo Hori).For those who have enjoyed Miyazaki's film for its fantastic side, you might miss it here. He tackles a more mature theme this time, and arguably this is his most complex film in terms of writing. Although I think it is not as good as Spirited Away, it still deserves to be considered as one of his most notable works."
73,The Wind Rises,7,14 February 2015,Animation for mature adults only,"(61%) As a relative newcomer to studio Ghibli, and Japanese animation in general I'm really quite split on what to make of it. On a big plus side it is unquestionably beautiful, finely detailed, and very well-made. But as far as this film in particular is concerned, and despite its depth, sweetness, and heart, is just something I couldn't warm to. In many ways it has a similar issue to what ""The fantastic Mr Fox"" has in that it should by all rights have a much wider appeal that it actually does. Everyone who watches this, regardless of age, should be able to take something away from doing so. But the fact is very few people under the age of twelve will actually make it all the way through until the end, and for something made by a company known as the Japanese Disney, that simply isn't good enough. This makes no real attempt to appeal to anyone except pre-established followers, critics, and mature cinema fans with its honestly quite bland central character, talky script, and there can't be that many eight year old's out there relishing a semi-romantic film based around a workaholic, chain-smoking plane designer in the still early days of flight. It is a good quality film, and as such it is worthy of note. But for something for all the family to enjoy? I think not."
74,The Wind Rises,6,13 February 2015,A nice story but with unclear linking method,"The movie's story is nice indeed. Based on a true factual person, this indeed is a fresh take by telling a biography through an animated movie. The story spanning a few years is also a good to see. I got to see the original Japanese language version and found that the voice acting sounded very genuine. But there are some things I find to be strange. The sound effects, particularly on the winds sound like they're done by people mouthing away the sounds acapella style. These bits sound overly hyperbolic at times potentially changing the mood of the scenes they're in. There's also less clear linkages to the scenes that transition between a few years time. But aside from those things I find the movie to be quite captivating. The coloration and color palette choice is very nice and soft to the eyes."
75,The Wind Rises,10,11 February 2015,A Amazing Farewell to the loved Studio Ghibli,"This film was beautiful and amazing. Every thing from the story to the amazing artwork to the lack of music; witch was a great part of the film to this being the farewell film to Studio Ghibli. Studio Ghibli has always done something amazing and epic were it takes you far away. In this film its real but still has that since of wonder and imagination. The Film Follows Jiro a Japanese kid who wants to build a plane and loves planes when in the end of it all he builds a war plane that would kill millions of people when all he wanted to do was build a beautiful air plane. Throughout out the film he keeps having theses day dreams with this French air plane designer they are always talking in one scene ""The french designer"" says ""Air planes are beautiful and amazing things to take flight and be engulfed in the sky to never return"". Over all this film has a very Studio Ghibli Anti war feeling to it same with ""Grave of the firefly"" ""From up on poppy hill"" ""Princess Mononoke"" and pretty much all of his films have a very Anti war theme to them. My favorite part was in the end *Spoiler Alert* Where Jiro is walking through this like grave yard of destroyed air planes and destruction and death when he walks through it and he see's a hill where he sees the french designer and he says ""Do you remember this place Japanese boy?"" Jiro says ""Yes this is the first place we met"" then the french designer says you have some one waiting for you"" Jiro sees his wife and she says ""you have to live on do you hear me you have to live on"" then disappears You hear the french designer say ""She was very beautiful"" ""Now lets stop by my place i have some nice wine"" Then he walks away The its just Jiro standing on the hill where he says ""thank you, Thank you for this adventure"" then he walks down the hill and it fades to black and after the credits it says ""The End"". That thank you Jiro says at the end of the film is Hayao Miyazaki saying thank you for coming with me on all these adventures thank you for being there. Thank you and Farewell."
76,The Wind Rises,9,28 January 2015,A (Fictionalized) and Beautiful Viewpoint of Jiro Horikoshi,"Review contains spoilers, mostly concerning Jiro's actual life and comparison.""Who has seen the wind? Neither I nor you: But when the leaves hang trembling, The wind is passing through."" The film consists of three major plot points: his dreams, his love for planes, and his love for love.His Dreams:The film begins in a way that is seen in many of Ghibli's film, a film of youth and wonder. It starts with a younger boy and his dreams, and then dwells into later portions of his life, mostly about a ten thirteen year period.Throughout the film, there are fictional sequences as well. Some of the more Miyazaki scenes are in these dreams. Mr. Caproni, Jiro's hero, based on Giovanni Battista Caproni, shows his love for flight as well. He reveals to be in his own dream as well and they share their love of flight. These happen to be some of my favorite scenes of the film, partially since it is the most Miyazaki like.His Love for Planes:While going through the major period of Jiro Horikoshi's young adult life, that is from University to post, it dwells on his idea of what aircraft should be. He wants to solely design planes as a sign of joy but knows that they will be used for war. He eventually designs the Zero plane, a plane that became known in the war as a fierce dog fighter.His love for love:There does happen to be a secondary plot point, his love life. In actuality, his wife never had tuberculosis. Knowing of this before the film, I felt a little bit of unwanted sentimentality. It wasn't exactly as necessary and it took away from the film's objectives.Summary:The Wind Rises is a rather interesting tale, and one that is unlike many of Miyazaki's films. The closest film in terms of themes is another film by Ghibli, Grave of the Fireflies, a movie as critically acclaimed as it is sad. It is highly recommended though.On another note, Hisashi's soundtrack is excellent. Highly recommended. Visuals are astounding. I also like the creative use of human voices for planes/earthquakes. It almost quite literally breaths life into these machines.8.5/10"
77,The Wind Rises,9,8 January 2015,A brilliant farewell gift from one of the greatest animators out there,"During the more commercial and less artistic days of animation, Hayao Miyazaki has stood strongly without faltering to the norm. His intelligent and imaginative sense of storytelling has elevated him just as high, or even higher than Walt Disney himself during his glory days. This film definitely proves that Miyazaki's magic won't die so easily.While not as epic or fantastic as Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away, the movie still stands out as not only as Miyazaki's great swan song, but a solid entry in his filmography anyway. All of his best trademarks contribute brilliantly to The Wind Rises. The story isn't the most complicated, but it is smartly told more through the animation itself than the dialogue, which is rather rare nowadays. The characters are very human, with strong relationships that never resort to Hollywood clichés. And last, but by no means least, the animation is incredible. The creativity and energy Miyazaki puts on his work, whether for theatrical animation or for a TV series, is art in its purest form(and this is coming from someone who's not a big anime fan at all).If there were any problems with the story itself, they would be relatively minor (like not giving much screen time to actual historic events during the advent of WWII) and wouldn't distract from the story itself at all. Whether viewed as a romance, a character study, or simply a more fantastical take on history, The Wind Rises is a must see for any animation fan, and definitely should've won the Academy Award last year."
78,The Wind Rises,8,7 January 2015,A Step Off the Beaten Path for Fantastically-Minded Studio Ghibli,"Studio Ghibli gets serious in this romanticized take on avionic design at the dawn of the second world war. Engineering might seem a strange subject for animation, and at times it is, but in typical fashion the studio delights in writing their own rules and somehow coming out ahead. In the same way that recent big-budget live action cinema has been trying to draw inspiration from animation's more fantastical elements, it seems that The Wind Rises borrows its mundane, grounding elements from reality. Detail has always been a calling card for Miyazaki's efforts, and here the old master has again outdone himself. The screen is flooded with life, with even the least remarkable background extra, almost-inanimate object, or stunning, towering cloudscape enjoying an unusual amount of motion and character - notes clearly taken from live action. There's no shortage of the studio's usual breathtaking flights of fancy and wonder, either, but now they're tempered by that basis in reality. And, in a way, that makes them even more special. Dreams intertwine with lucidity so casually, it's tough to identify the moments of transition. The plot is less rigid than one might expect, too, strolling along at its own pace and lazily floating from one decade to the next. That makes it less gripping than the standard Ghibli effort, but we're invested in different ways. Gorgeous, poetic, relaxing, inspiring, warm and funny and bittersweet; it's not at all what I expected, and no competition for Totoro or Mononoke or Spirited Away, but it's not trying to be."
79,The Wind Rises,8,4 January 2015,Splendid storytelling but with flaws,"The story was very moving. Partially because I love the double meaning of the phrase ""The Wind"", which made the story compact. The sometimes bad ""wind"" finally brought good results to the one who didn't give up. This kind of ""wind"" happened in Jiro's life for several times, from his childhood to his success. Also, ""trying to live"" was demonstrated later.But the flaw comes. It mentioned the secret police, but never mentioned the result on Jiro later. From my view, they may want to get the story more reasonable by adding this plot, but to make the story compact, they didn't mention it too much. This is difficult to solve for most people, as there is a paradox between. I have no idea about how to solve that, but I also don't think this story is the best solution. I still believe a masterpiece could solve this smoothly, so this is my reason for an 8."
80,The Wind Rises,9,27 December 2014,The wonder of flight,"This is only the second Miyazaki film that I have seen (after The Castle of Cagliostro) and already I'm hooked. The Wind Rises was by far the best animated film of 2013 and it's a shame it did not win the Oscar. The film follows the Japanese aeronautical engineer Jiro Horikoshi as he grows up, designs planes, and falls in love during the first half of the 20th century. The animation is both technically brilliant and artistically inspired, and perfectly captures the beauty and wonder of human flight, especially in Jiro's many dream sequences. I watched the English dubbed version, and the dialogue and most of the voice cast were fine (John Krasinki was the week link), but I definitely wish I understood Japanese as I've heard the dialogue is gorgeous."
81,The Wind Rises,9,21 December 2014,"It's sad to see the end of Hayao Miyazaki's career, but he went out on a high","In what is sadly the swansong of the animation legend Hayao Miyazaki, he tells the story of Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed fighter planes in World War II. The Wind Rises certainly goes beyond that simple premise and is a devastatingly powerful and beautifully bittersweet movie which outshines everything animated from 2013 (Yes, including Frozen) by a clear mile. The Wind Rises suffers a little from an excessive running time and at times it feels like there's not enough conflict in the story to justify the length, so it could feel style over substance to some. The Wind Rises doesn't have a lot of emphasis on plot however, and is a powerful character study, a moving love story and a tribute to aircraft all rolled into a stunning whole. There's still plenty of deep emotion and while the film can feel a bit safe, it's still deeply touching. There's also a real sense of tranquillity and calm in TWR which you don't normally get during animated films. Maybe Miyazaki's most mature film to date.The film looks amazing in every single frame, and at times it feels more visually stunning than a Pixar movie. Miyazaki puts all of his visual wizardry into every single frame, and he saved the most dazzling stuff for his last film. His direction is typically amazing, and the film feels like true art. To be honest, The Wind Rises feels like an artist painting on a canvas. Like the planes in the centre of its story, it takes off and completely soars. The study of the main character is fascinating, but the love story even more so. Although it was pretty obvious there was going to be a love story this defies expectations by the love story not being cloying and sentimental. TWR often feels like a tribute to the magic of flight, and it's difficult not to be amazed as flight is looked upon with a sense of child-like wonder. A soaring swansong for Miyazaki, and an achingly wonderful story rendered in exquisite artistic fashion.9/10"
82,The Wind Rises,8,14 December 2014,Glad to see Miyazaki went out on a high note,"The Wind Rises does not tell a very complex story, but it doesn't really need to. It's about a boy who has a passion for airplanes. That's really it. Despite it's very simple premise, this movie manages to evoke many emotions from the viewer; such as inspiration, sadness, hope, love, and happiness. It's animation is brilliant of course. I wouldn't expect anything else from Miyazaki. This film is a poignantly beautiful one and it pleases me that Miyazaki ended his long career with such a fantastic movie. I look forward to the future of Studio Ghibli, as they have consistently produced amazing movie after amazing movie."
83,The Wind Rises,,10 December 2014,"Animated, highly fictional story of Jirô Horikoshi of the Japanese Zero airplane fame.","Jirô Horikoshi was born in 1903 and graduated from the newly established Aviation Laboratory within the Engineering Department of the University of Tokyo. He started his airplane design career with the Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine Company Limited. In the late 1930s his team designed a prototype fighter plane completed in 1940, the year 2600 for the Japanese, thus it was named the ""00"" or better known to us as the ""Zero"" which was instrumental in WW2. This is a Japanese language movie but was also released in an English version. Joseph Gordon-Levitt provides the voice for Jirô Horikoshi.The story itself is highly fictional. It depicts Jiro dreaming about flying from an early age, then as an engineer dreaming about his designs, including crashes in his dreams as he realized the flaws. The animation is old style and looks very good. The animated scenes are stunning. It is a very nice movie to look at. The story itself is for mature audiences, children will not generally appreciate it. It depicts Jiro as falling in love with a girl that the ""rising wind"" keeps getting them together. She was suffering from tuberculosis and had a short time to live but he married her anyway. In his real life he didn't have a younger sister, he had an older brother. His wife did not have tuberculosis and they had children.Much of this film shows the devastation of war, how Japan's ill- advised attack at Pearl Harbor in 1941 awakened the sleeping giant, resulting in much of Japan being destroyed. Jiro himself has been quoted as:"" When we awoke on the morning of December 8, 1941, we found ourselves  without any foreknowledge  to be embroiled in war...Since then, the majority of us who had truly understood the awesome industrial strength of the United States never really believed that Japan would win this war... But now, bereft of any strong government move to seek a diplomatic way out, we are being driven to doom. Japan is being destroyed. I cannot do (anything) other but to blame the military hierarchy and the blind politicians in power for dragging Japan into this hellish cauldron of defeat ""Very worthwhile movie."
84,The Wind Rises,10,2 December 2014,the most different and touching miyazaki movie,"the wind rises is miyazaki's masterpiece, like he suddenly awoken from his dreamy movies and decided to make a serious film. and what a result!the views are stunning portraits, the wind effects and sounds (all made by voice!) incredibly lively, and each line a piece of poetry. we follow the life of jiro horikoshi, trough his dream of building wonderful planes, his cursed love, and the shadow of ww2 approaching. the movie is a reflection on dreams and machines so, tell me... would you rather live in a world with or without pyramids?i'll just say that my 57 yo mother burst into tears at the end (along with me, of course)MUST. WATCH."
85,The Wind Rises,8,30 October 2014,Reel Look: 'The Wind Rises',"""Inspiration unlocks the future."" Released in Japan as Kaze Tachinu (風立ちぬ), ""The Wind Rises"" is a 2013 Japanese animated historical drama film based on an original story written and directed by the anime master himself Hayao Miyazaki, which was adapted from his own manga of the same name. But first, a little history. The movie was loosely based on a 1937 short story of the same name by Tatsuo Horia writer, poet and translator from mid-20th century (Shōwa period) Japan. This era in Asia was potentially a ""period of enlightened peace/harmony"" or ""period of radiant Japan"". It was the time when Japanese history corresponded to the reign of the Shōwa Emperor, Hirohito, from Dec. 25, 1926 through Jan. 7, 1989. ""The Wind Rises"" is a fictionalized biography of Jiro Horikoshi (1903-1982), designer of the Mitsubishi A5M and its successor, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero and of whose life Miyazaki pays tribute in chronicling. But does Miyazaki's last work truly take flight? Let's take a look.Set in early 1918 Japan, a bespectacled boy named Jiro Horikoshi (voiced for American audiences by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a young kid with giant dreams and aspirations of flight, living in a provincial town. We first see him as a boy, having a dream about climbing up onto his roof donning aviator goggles and taking off in a bird-like plane. Suddenly a large, monstrous ship emerges from the clouds, dropping anthropomorphic bombs on him as his plane tailspins and plummets to the ground. He awakens but has another dream later on in the film where he meets Carponi, (Stanley Tucci) an famous Italian aeronautical plane designer, posing also as the a mentor for the eager lad as well. Carponi tells Jiro that he cannot fly a plane with glasses, but teaches him that the art and passion of building aircraft is better than flying aircraft itself. Jiro awakens again and decides to construct planes that will truly push the technological envelope. Five years later, traveling by train back to Tokyo after holiday from studying engineering at a university, he meets a young girl named Naoko (Emily Blunt) who is also traveling with her maid. Enter the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and the train grinds to a halt, causing the maid to break her leg. Jiro then delivers the maid and Naoko to their family and then walks away without revealing his name. Jiro then goes on to become an airplane manufacturer, assigned to a fighter design team, which ends in disaster. He is sent to Germany to do technical research and obtain a production license for a Junkers aircraft. While there, Jiro dreams of Carponi again, who further mentors him amidst his discouragement. He runs into his love interest Naoko again in 1932 at a summer resort. He is happy to see her but feels disappointed as well, as he had now been promoted the position of the chief designer for a fighter plane competition that had also ended in disaster. Jiro confesses his love of Naoko later on to her father, and Naoko overhears and accepts. But having been afflicted with an incurable case of tuberculosis, she refuses to marry him as she is later sent away to an alpine sanatorium. As her health continues to deteriorate, the love between the two grows ever stronger, right up to the day when Jiro's prototype of what would become the Mitsubishi A5M takes to the skies. Ending in a dream sequence, Carponi tells Jiro that his dreams and inspirations were nonetheless realized as Naoko appears in his dream for the final time, urging her husband to live on in the trust she had thus placed within him.This film is a fittingly bittersweet farewell to the great director Miyazaki; a somber sayonara to one of the greatest masters of anime. At seventy-three years old, his vision and scope throughout this particular art form over the decades his indeed pushed the boundaries of where this medium could possibly go, creating a whole new level all on its own and into the hearts of all who have loved and grown up watching his beloved albeit haunting films. His retirement after a long career of meticulous drawings he shared with the world will and should always be cherished that originated from the mind of a man who performed glorious yet sometimes disturbing magic with the tip of a pencil. Miyazaki's movies will always continue to emanate his essence with each viewing, reminding viewers that his passion for what he did has indeed touched a certain place in all of us that evoked a moment of laughter, tears or deep and eloquent thought about the God-given beauty that surrounds us everyday with a newer understanding, within a 2D environment. He awoke a realm of imagination and fantasy from its slumber and made it his, sharing it with everyone and anyone who are willing to really open their minds to embrace his creations and worlds on an entirely new and unfamiliar spectrum.""The Wind Rises"" might be Miyakazi's most mature film to date. Although the drawings lack a bit in detail compared to his earlier films, the depth is still there, along with the means of telling a meaningful story of endearment, tragedy and love. With echoes of ""Grave of the Fireflies"" and ""Spirited Away,"" this film both reveals a fantasy/drama and knows when to show this without falling into schmaltz, despite its turbulent surroundings. From flights of the imagination to the horrors of WWII amidst Germany-occupied Japan, Miyazaki again does not disappoint in his last magnum opus to his Eastern and Western audiences alike. Inspiring, bold and rapturously beautiful, ""The Wind Rises"" is an innovative yet melancholy swan song of the visionary amine wizard, who indeed adapted this very concept and truly took it to new and incredible heights; a film that will continue to soar long after the successful career of the great anime artiste."
86,The Wind Rises,10,18 October 2014,Went Out On A High Note,"I've been a fan of Studio Ghibli's work for sometime since watching Howl's Moving Castle and My Neighbour Totoro earlier this year on DVD and Blu-Ray. Ever since then, I loved their films and this one is definitely one of the greats. The storyline, although fictional when it comes to the protagonist such as his wife's dramatic illness, was very emotional and you can feel very sorry for him as well. In reality, he was highly against the second world war and had never dreamed that Japan would never win the war. The love he has for designing planes was great and gives a message out to everyone that planes aren't used to be weapons, they are meant to be beautiful, which the designer in the film had once murmured, according to Miyazaki, 'All I want was to make something beautiful'. The development of the main character was good and the animation...my god, it was fanf***ingtastic! It was fluid, it was creative, it's art. Ghibli's films have the greatest form of traditional animation, it's up there with the likes of Disney. It's sad that this was Hayao Miyazaki's last film and I think he went out on a high note, it's wonderful, it's emotional and the anti war message, although very small, is shown through interpretation. I know that this film had gained a lot of controversy in Japan last year because of that, but films like 'Graves of the Fireflies' seem more like an anti-war film and where is the criticism for that? I know that the director wasn't going for an anti-war message in that film, but when you see it you can feel it.I'm looking forward to this movie on Blu-Ray, it's not only one of my favourite Ghibli films, not only one of my favourite animated films, but it's one of my favourite movies period."
87,The Wind Rises,8,12 October 2014,The lovely swan song of a genius,"After the disappointing Ponyo, I was afraid that Miyazaki simply wasn't capable of reaching the brilliance of his earlier films. So my first reaction to the Wind Rises is one of relief. While not at the level of his best films, like Spirited away and My Neighbor Toturo, this is an absolutely lovely movie, and as visually stunning as anything Miyazaki has produced.Outside of a few dream sequences, there is nothing fantastical about this film, which instead follows the career of a genial and impassioned aircraft designer in the years that preceded World War II. Visually the film is stunning. There are amazing moments, like an earthquake or a sudden rainstorm, that are startling in their strange beauty. While the story is generally engrossing though, it is also problematic. Not all characters integrate well into the narrative, particularly a rather mysterious German. An episodic structure creates an uneven flow. The lengthy movie overstays its welcome by about 20 minutes. And the whole idea of somewhat innocently creating something used so horribly rings a little false. Even though it lacks the fantasy elements of Miyazaki's best films, and even though this is not one of his best scripts (films like Ponyo and Arietty suggest that regardless of his filmmaker skills, his writing skills are weakening), overall this is just a lovely movie full of terrific moments."
88,The Wind Rises,9,26 September 2014,The  Wind  Rises  is  a  brilliant  animated  film,"In The Wind Rises, his last film as a director (let's hope he retracts himself once more), filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki decided to make a semi-fictitious biography of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the famous combat airplane Zero, whose speed and maneuverability made it an almost impossible adversary for the allies in the Pacific front during World War II. It's a complicated and dangerous subject which runs the risk of getting into into political postures, but The Wind Rises wisely minimizes the war elements in order to focus on topics which have been present in many Miyazaki's films: the simple pleasure of flying and the freedom which represents defying gravity and sliding through the clouds, whether it's on a broom (like in Kiki's Delivery Service) or with different experimental airplanes, like in The Wind Rises. Inspired since he was a kid by the feats from aviator Giovanni Caproni, Hirokoshi dreamt with flying airplanes, but his marked myopia couldn't allow him to do that. So, he decided to learn to design them, and during his university studies, he showed such a talent that he was quickly recruited by the setter Mitsubishi, where Hirokoshi found big triumphs and resounding failures, but always with the objective of the pure flight... even though his creations were used in less humanitarian circumstances. The Wind Rises includes some fantasy sequences, mainly focused on Hirokashi's dreams and ""visions"", where he imagines conversations with Caproni; leaving that aside, I think this is Miyazaki's most sober and realistic film. However, that didn't avoid him from delighting us with his habitual visual richness, the fluid hand-made animation (well, with a few digital incursions when the circumstances require so), and an amazing production design where even the most trivial details of daily life acquire an unexpected beauty. I would also like to mention the delicate handling of the political tensions during World War II. The alliance between Japan and Germany is portrayed like a necessary evil, implemented more for practical than ideological reasons. The scenes in which Hirokashi visits Germany in order to share secrets with European colleagues reflect a melancholy we can interpret as a regret for the mistakes of the past. It was fascinating to see that moral disjunctive depicted. But, well, as I said before, The War Rises isn't a war film, but a pseudo- biography which doesn't adhere to the facts, but to the dreams; to the ideals of flying and constructing effective aerodynamic systems which get us a little bit close to the birds' casual and instinctive ability. In conclusion, I liked The Wind Rises very much, and even though I wouldn't consider it my favorite Miyazaki's film (that one keeps being Princess Mononoke), it's definitely his most mature and personal work. If this truly ends up being his last movie, it would be an excellent way to close his filmography, and a clear testimony that traditional animation keeps being as vital and expressive as always. But, beyond the technique, Miyazaki reminds us of the importance of aspiring to an ideal; and I think his filmography has been a definite proof of it."
89,The Wind Rises,7,21 September 2014,Only for engineers,"This is a trademark Miyazaki film, with its slow, reflective mood throughout and its focus on boring characters. I felt a connection to Jiro and rather liked him, but this was largely based on his affinity for aeronautical engineering (I also studied engineering). With the long time-line of the film, I was sometimes confused as to who was who; I'm not sure if it was the same woman all along. She was totally uninteresting and resultantly, I had no real concern for her whenever she was in trouble, but perhaps some concern for Jiro by extension.The detail and accuracy of the animations certainly adds to the engagement of the film and the recurring dreams of Caproni certainly help in conveying Jiro's enthusiasm for engineering. I would only recommend this film to people with an existing interest in engineering or science."
90,The Wind Rises,7,15 September 2014,A real oddity,"In 'tween wars Japan, a young man finds love while pursuing his passion for aeronautical engineering, which culminates in the design of the Mitsubishi Zero.From the synopsis, one might not expect this to be an animated film from Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki: there is not the slightest touch of the fabulous to it (other than protagonist Jiro's tendency to have conversations with his Italian hero Caproni). Instead, it is a gentle retelling of part of Jiro's life story, with as much attention paid to the gentle love story as to the aircraft design.As is always the case with Studio Ghibli, the film looks gorgeous. The animation is good without being dazzling. The non-Japanese voice cast is star-studded without ever overpowering the dialogue, and the story unfolds in leisurely fashion (somoetime a little too leisurely).It is a gentle, and sometimes moving, experience."
91,The Wind Rises,9,8 September 2014,The Wind Rises Review,"The Wind Rises is the, seemingly, final film by Director Hayao Miyazaki and by God, this is a great film to go out on. The story follows Jiro Horikoshi, the inventor of the Japanese Zero during World War II and the story centers on his work with airplanes and his romance with Nahoko Satomi who is deathly sick. All Jiro wants is to create beautiful airplanes.The film is gorgeous all the way to the last frame. The direction is spot on, which is to be expected by a top notch director. The English voice work is very well done and the whole story just keeps you enticed until the very end. It teaches that dreams can be destroyed by war and disease but they will always live on to new horizons.I can't really find any negative thoughts for this film just maybe a slow part in the middle but it was necessary. The story is also very tragic basically documenting the downfall of Japan. As they mention throughout the film ""Japan is going to explode..."" And if you know your history it does. The film is an absolute masterwork and this is from someone who is not altogether a huge anime or Studio Gibli fan. This is definitely a film I would own and watch again."
92,The Wind Rises,7,2 September 2014,Brilliant - and naïve?,"First of all: I really enjoyed this movie; sometimes I was even amazed  but at some points also a bit irritated, to say the least. Since there is already enough praise for this movie, I will focus on the other aspects. The plot of the movie is set between 1918 and 1945, i.e. between the ends of both world wars, and during most of the plot there is a war going on: First in China, then in the rest of Asia, and at the end also in Japan itself. From time to time the viewer is reminded of these facts by short scenes or just remarks, but it is easy to forget this: The war hardly affects the lives of the main characters; especially Jiro does not seem to care about politics; he only cares about planes, constructing and building planes  even though he knows they would be used in war eventually, killing thousands and thousands of people. Well, in reality there certainly were many people like Jiro, who have seen themselves as nonpolitical, as mere experts, doing their jobs, which they enjoyed. Understandable! But is it feasible, is it acceptable to do a movie TODAY, which is basically praising these people, presenting them as totally innocent? Being from Germany, I think I can say for sure that it is unthinkable to do a movie in Germany today about (for example) Willy Messerschmitt without stressing his role in the war, without stressing his guilt. (Messerschmitt was probably the most important aircraft designer in Nazi Germany and from the same generation as Jiro. Hugo Junkers, mentioned in ""The Wind rises"", died already in 1935 and was no friend of the Nazis.) Without people like Jiro, the attack on Pearl Harbor would not have been possible! Showing him as a nice, naïve, sometimes even childish guy is, well, a bit irritating to me, and maybe a bit naïve by Miyazaki himself. In this point I agree with some of the earliest reviewers for this movie.I am aware of a certain reactionary tendency in Anime: Sometimes Japanese directors and authors try to do win the lost war in retrospect, like James Braddock, John Rambo & Company in Vietnam. In Japanese Anime, for example, they have the ""Space Battleship Yamamoto""; in ""Grave of the Fireflies"", the Japanese are mere victims, and so on. Until now, I thought Miyazaki would be different, but it seems he is at least influenced to a certain degree by this tendency. Based on his other movies, I am sure he is much more of a pacifist than a militarist, but he must be aware of the doubtful morality of Jiro's work, in spite of all his fascination for planes.But I want to close with a bit of praise, because this aspect hasn't been mentioned here, as far as I know: There are a couple of references to the novel ""Der Zauberberg"" (The magic mountain) by Thomas Mann, which is quite remarkable for a movie of this genre. Hans Castorp, the guy who Jiro meets in the Hotel, is actually one of the main characters from the novel, though it seems that in ""The Wind rises"" he has also some characteristics of Mann himself, who was probably the best-known German voice in the exile. This adds a bit more of magic to this movie  which I am judging probably as too realistic."
93,The Wind Rises,,19 June 2014,Beautifully moving,"The film is likely to not be all that liked by children. It doesn't have much fantasy, if at all really. It doesn't have the sensibilities found in children's' films, not even those that would be in a film like Spirited Away. This is a pretty quiet, subdued film, even for the director's standards, but it's pretty well executed on all fronts. I don't find it as amazing as many others do, but it's a pretty strong effort. It's very poetic and sort of transcendent in its execution. The dubbed English voices are pretty great, and as usual, they seemed to fit in the tone with the film and aren't distracting. This is recommended to adult filmgoers."
94,The Wind Rises,5,18 September 2013,Disappointing Swan Song From Miyasaki,"The Wind Rised is a fictionalized biographical film about Jiro Horikoshi, a Japanese aeronautical engineer who designed military aircrafts before and during WWII. WWII is still a sensitive topic, especially for people as myself who is from neighbouring countries which were deeply hurt by Japan. The Wind Rises is about a man's dream of designing planes. Unfortunately his designs were used for war purposes. In this movie, the real events became a faded background. Miyazaki told the story from a very narrow personal respective. You don't feel the war affected the characters in the story in a deep way. I think I cannot enjoy the story. Speaking of war-themed Studio Ghibli movies, I was moved by Grave of the Fireflies. But I cannot say the same about The Wind Rises.Besides chasing the dream of designing aircrafts, The Wind Rises is also a love story. There are a few touching moments. But such precious moments were rather pale in an era of wars and tragedies. Visually, the movie is okay, but not as breathtaking as Studio Ghibli's previous movies (as I remembered). There are a lot of smoking scenes, and a few kissing scenes. I can't remember if there were kissing scenes in other Studio Ghibli movies. For a moment, I wondered if there would be a sex scene. Oh no, it didn't happen ;pTo sum up, The Wind Rises is a disappointment as a swan song from such an accomplished director. Afterall, telling a story based on real persons and events is just not his strong suit."
95,The Wind Rises,7,14 August 2013,A Rough Landing,"Shortly after watching Kaze Tachinu, I was ready to declare it one of my favorite Ghibli movies simply based off the emotional imprint it left upon my heart during the weeks following. The tragic love story between a man pursuing his dream and a girl afflicted by (at least then) an incurable disease touched me in the same way an ill-fated romance movie would have, and based off that emotional bridge that Miyazaki so eloquently built...his movie received high praise from me.On second thought, this movie was far from the traditional Ghibli film and overall was one of the weakest plot-wise. Sans the traditional expectations of a Ghibli movie (the talking animals, the sprinkle of magic, the infusion of various European architecture into a rural Japan, etc.), it was a shaky plot that seemed to eager to follow the true story of Jiro while forcing in as much incoherent fantasy references as possible. The love story, albeit one containing boatloads of human emotion and the standard perseverance, was not developed well from the beginning. Sometimes a nontraditional love story will work, but with Jiro seemingly slipping in and out of who he really is during the course of the film, it is hard to create a solid foundation when the characters are not truly well defined. Jiro has to be one of the few leading characters in a Ghibli movie I failed to make any true connection with, and I found him to be a relatively dull and uneventful character.This brings me to the abrupt ending. It did leave me in complete silence, and it took me to the end of ""Hikouki Kumo"" to realize that the movie was over and Jiro's story, at least as far as we were concerned, ended with his final dream sequence and his tears of achievement and sheer loss. It was without a doubt a well-crafted, touching ending that left many of those around me in tears, yet it was not a fulfilling ending. Perhaps it was Miyazaki's wish to leave the audience with that profound sense of emptiness when they realize that Satomi chooses to leave Jiro, and he is content with letting her die alone in the mountains. Regardless, Jiro's ""triumph"" at the end is bittersweet, and somewhat conflicts everything he stood for from the beginning to the end.What Miyazaki and Ghibli has done with this movie is a brave venture, and the gamble did pay off to certain respects. It is a mature film; nowhere near Grave of the Fireflies, but definitely will allow you to carry a heavy heart after watching it. Expectations regarding Ghibli aside, the weak plot and weak main character takes away from what would have been an excellent film."
96,The Wind Rises,1,30 November 2014,Very boring and slow paced,"I watched two other titles from Hayao Miyazaki and I was very impressed with the creativity used in Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. Those two titles were very memorable.However huge disappointment with The Wind Rises. The movie is just trying to tell a story where nothing happens. The animation is also very badly executed for a movie done in 2013.The only memorable thing about this movie is that it got me a bad anxiety. Anxiety to get to the end of it.Don't waste your time watching this. The 5 stars reviews are probably paid or done by the director fans. If you watch the movie for what it is, is 1 start. Worse animation movies ever!"
97,The Wind Rises,5,15 March 2015,Would you want a world without pyramids?,"Once again a masterpiece of Miyazaki, full of strong feelings between calm, cold-blood passions of the characters and brutality of their world. As a fan of Miyazaki, i feel betrayed by this movie and the ideas it contains, opposed to the ideas of peace, diversity, ecology, freedom i found in the other works of the sensei. My note is strongly penalized by ideology considerations. Dreams and work. War and technology. Power of nature and power of weapons. Murder and empire justified in the name of evolution. Excellent film though, i will recommend another work of Miyazaki for neophytes to familiarize with (mononoke, nausicaa, castle in the sky, etc..), but amateurs will find very interesting elements in it."
98,The Wind Rises,9,26 March 2014,The Wind Rises raises standards of good anime,"So, a movie about the engineer who created the scourge of World War Two's pacific arena: Japan's Zero Fighter. One may not expect a fully positive reaction about such a story. The zeros were after all highly feared and brought a swift Japanese domination to East Asia. Yet through the masterful visual storytelling of anime maestro Hayao Miyazaki, this story is adapted into a timeless tale about one man who dared to dream and dared to chase that dream, for better or for worse.Jiro Horikoshi is a boy with ambition. He aims to create the most advanced aircraft in the world; not as weapons of war but as constructs of beauty of splendour compared to the pyramids of Egypt. Spured on by vivid visions of his hero, a classic Italian plane designer named Caproni, Jiro chases his dream. Yet events in life threaten to crush those dreams. First, a disastrous earthquake and fire in which Jiro's selfless nature touches the heart of a girl named Naoko. Then, when he finally lands a job with an aircraft manufacturer, his projects are plagued with failure after failure. A fateful encounter with Naoko years later lands the young couple deeply in love. Jiro, now torn between his ever more time consuming dreams and his steadily weakening wife, has to bear the full consequence of the choices in his life. The Wind Rises is the much advertised swan song of Hayao Miyazaki. And boy does he go out with a good one. Miyazaki peppers this movie with studio Ghibli's little touches of fantasy, particularly in the dream sequences. Easily his most heart wrenching story, the tale of Jiro is emotionally powerful with some genuine tear jerking moments. Although devoid of action, the story moves at a brisk pace through Jiro's life. The fun comes from the various colourful characters Jiro meets along his journey. From his future darling to a quirky German man critical of Hitler's regime, all these characters lend colour to what could have been a dull biopic. To present this lively vision, Studio Ghibli utilises 100% hand drawn and coloured animation. Immediately, the animation has the look of the old classics while still being able to stand toe to toe with modern anime. It is almost lifelike in how smooth the movements of the characters are. Character designs are simple, yet the level of detail shows that the studio spared no expense on the animation. Visual metaphors abound and certain scenes are given some exaggeration as if coloured by Jiro's own emotions and imagination. The result is a beautiful, dynamic, and refreshing visual style that complements the story.The Wind Rises is surprisingly loaded with symbolism and easter eggs for long time anime fans who are willing to dig deeper. In a way, the story of Jiro and the aeroplane mirrors that of Japanese anime and possibly Miyazaki's message to a new generation of anime creators looking to follow in his footsteps. Like the Zero Fighter, anime started off content with copying the style of western cartoons. Through some brave pioneers pushing the boundaries, anime evolved into its own style and like the Zero Fighter, surpassed its western contemporaries. In the dreamscape, Caprioni talks to Jiro of retiring and how Jiro should continue to chase his dreams despite the fear that his designs would be used for war. That's Miyazaki speaking; encouraging new creators to find their own style, forge their own stories, and no matter how companies may twist the medium to its own selfish gain, animation will always be a thing of beauty. Fitting then that Hideaki Anno, controversial creator of infamous anime such as Gunbuster and Neon Genesis Evangelion, be the one to portray the voice of Jiro, a similarly controversial figure in history. A minor flaw with the movie would be the main character. Jiro himself is a little bit of a bore. He is the boy scout who stands up for the bullied, the smart savvy man who leaves his rivals speechless in an argument. All this is not helped by Hideki Anno's flat and emotionally deficient delivery of Jiro's lines. Thats what you get when a director tries to be an actor. The initial romance between Jiro and Naoko may also come across as mind numbingly cheesy, but their eventual life together and trials they face is a big emotional payoff.A bittersweet little yarn with all the makings of an anime classic, The Wind Rises proves that hand drawn 2D animation still has a place in a market saturated by 3D CGI and increasingly flashy computer coloured anime. Watch it for the tragic love story, the colourful characters, the symbolism and deeper themes. As the wind rises, so too does the standard on which good anime is measured."
99,The Wind Rises,10,21 September 2015,Best Film of the Decade,"The Wind Rises Review5 out of 5 StarsAs a self-proclaimed Ghibli-holic, I am just a bit ashamed to admit that I had not watched this movie up until recently. It takes me longer to warm up to the idea to watching a film than I'd like to admit. It would probably be a lot quicker if I tried to force myself to watch these movies, but then their impact on me would be limited. I have to prepare myself for what lies ahead. But prepare myself I did and here we are.This is Miyazaki's most beautiful movie, and that is saying something.Onto the review.This film has an eighty-nine percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. That is a shame. It deserves a perfect one hundred. I would like to walk up to the eleven percent of so-called professional 'critics' who don't like the movie and perform a wholly terrible act onto them. Some of these people have said this movie is boring. Shame on you. Do you realize that you are promoting more terrible, snappy movies and less masterpieces? I think one of the major problems is that most all of the critics of the movie on that site are Western. Yes, people will always find something to complain about, but, as a Westerner myself, I do say that we are awfully impatient people who want instant satisfaction.This is not that kind of movie. It does not cater to the banality of the masses. One of my favorite films of all time is Leon: The Professional. Comparing it to the rest of Besson's work is an unneeded embarrassment to the latter. The reason I love it so much is that it doesn't seem like it was made by a group of focus groups for our dim masses. It seems like it was made by an artist first for himself. If the world didn't like it, too bad. This film is much the same. It has Miyazaki's heart and soul over its every corner and ridge. He should not have gone out with Mononoke or Spirited Away or a new feature film. This should be his last movie. It is him, through and through.I don't mind if the masses don't like that. It was not made for them. But professional critics, people who are actually getting paid to write reviews, should be better than that. I was better than that when I was fourteen years old and I'm still not getting paid to write these. The basic concept of this movie is that a young boy wants to be a pilot but can't because of his shoddy eyesight so he instead becomes an engineer. He designs some of the best planes in Japan but is forced to come to terms with the fact that they will be used for war. Interspersing this are multiple dream sequences, in which he talks to his idol, the famous Italian designer Caproni. Many have called these sequences boring and repetitive. They... should not be reviewing movies. Nothing is further from the truth. These sequences tie the film together. They are its heart and soul. They kickstart and end it. And they are the thematic core to the film.The film opens with a simple French poem. It goes like this: The wind is rising... we must try to live. Those words struck me like no other. I felt my soul quake. And that's not even mentioning the fact that the name of Ghibli, Miyazaki's studio, comes from a word meaning 'warm wind (thus a rising wind) coming off the Sahara.' The number of ways this should be Miyazaki's last film are too numerous to list here. But rest assured that this is a fitting last film to possibly the greatest director of our times.This poem provides the basis for the theme of the film. Dream Caproni asks Jiro, the protagonist, in many stages of his life, 'Is the wind rising, Japanese boy?"" To which he would respond with some variation of 'Yes, it is.' That is not a phrase fit for a typical three act film. That is a phrase fit for life. I suppose some critics can't handle life. I even saw one say that this film couldn't be penetrated unless you had an understanding of aviation. What a load of mularkey. This film can only be understood by someone who understands life. Generally speaking, the people who don't' like this film have no understanding of the melancholy beauty of life. It treats the audience like capable, functioning adults and not like incessant babies like a lot of films do. Yes, I am angry, depressed, wistful, and joyful right now. This is how life leaves you. And this is how this film leaves you. It is one of those movies that is not only too good to be dissed, it is too good to be praised. I feel dirty even talking about this piece of pure art, Nothing I say here can measure up to the beauty I have seen.Some have said that this is not a perfect film. They are right. It is beyond perfection. It is beyond all of our measly, worthless, petty terms. This is a better film than Frozen. This is a better film than anything released that year. It is, without qualification, the best film of the decade."
100,The Wind Rises,,14 August 2014,Too plain,"This film tells the story of a young man who works hard to become a successful aircraft designer.""The Wind Rises"" focuses on the life of this young man, especially his kind hearted nature. He helps strangers without expecting anything in return. His dedication to designing aircrafts deserves applause, and even better is that he's clearly very good at what he does. It's a pity though, the film solely focuses on what happens to him. The story is told in a very plain manner, and there is little to engage, excite or astound. Even the supposed emotional climax did nothing for me.To me, this film is a disappointment compared to the previous work of Miyazaki. I hope the next one will wow me like the earlier works did."
101,The Wind Rises,7,23 June 2014,A different view,"Let's begin with the positive. This movie is undeniably well crafted. There's more animation in a woman folding her shirt than there is in an entire episode of Naruto. The music was nice, but scarce and often held quite a similar theme throughout the film. The story was good, mainly a character driven plot, with some enjoyable dream scenes. I liked how throughout the film it shifted between dream/imagination and reality. Sometimes I questioned whether this story was set in the real world or some alternate universe, with subtle differences. Now a few negative comments and why I had to drop three stars... I personally felt it was a little bit too slow. This doesn't mean to say I wanted something fast paced, because it almost felt like the pacing of the film reflected the beautiful calm of souring through the sky in a plane. But some scenes really did feel far too slow, and I felt there was far too much animation, I hate to say it, wasted on fleshing out scenes when it could have been put to much better use adding to facial animation (which I'll get to in a tick) or even making another movie! The emotional content felt like it was poorly executed in places and could have had a much more jarring effect. A good way to put it is anticlimactic, not in content just execution. Their faces also didn't really show much emotion; usually if someone was sad, they'd keep the same expression and tears would form. Perhaps this lack of facial expression throughout the film could just be the culture of the Japanese and not an issue with bad acting, yes animators are actors.Also, it was quite void of music which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it might have made it that much better with an amazing score.All in all, I left the film fairly satisfied, it was a pleasure to watch but I won't be going out of my way to recommend this film, unless I was speaking to someone with a love for animation. After the hype has died down I think it'll average out to around 7.4-7.7/10"
102,The Wind Rises,9,23 May 2014,"Not Your Ordinary Ghibli Movie, but Still Gives You a Hell Lot of Lessons for Life","I am a Ghibli Studio fan. Despite being a Ghibli fan, I've just watched a few. That is, Grave of the fireflies, Howl's moving castle, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Ponyo.From what I have watched, what I've learned from ghibli movies is that they sell fantasies. When saying fantasies, is that they don't give you anything else in their movies. Just a full enjoyment of bounces and colors and funny events and funny characters. But this is the first ghibli movie that gave me a different experience.When they told me it was about airplanes, I expected a dreamy kind of film about planes. But this was a serious type of movie. With a rather realistic story. Does it disappoint? It does not.So it gives you a couple of ghibli-ish scenes where you can sit back and relax and love what you see. My couple of favorite scenes were Jiro's first dream and the paper plane scene at the hotel.But when Jiro is not dreaming it gives you a serious story. And this is the most important part about this film: A life lesson about dreaming and pursuing your dream. What I learned about this film is if your not as serious as Jiro when you pursue your dream, your not doing your life right. This gave me humongous slaps of reflection. Let's all be the Jiro in what we do."
103,The Wind Rises,8,19 May 2014,Miyazaki's last film,"Disclaimer: This is a review of the Japanese language version.Hayao Miyazaki is one of the greats of Japanese cinema, making many classic animated films. He is bowing out of filmmaking with his final film, a fictionalised story about aircraft designer Jiro Horikoshi.As a young boy Jiro (Hideaki Anno) dreams of flying and making an aircraft, using his talents to design the Zero fighter despite the limits of the technology as Japan becomes more industrial and militarised. As his professional life goes from strength to strength Jiro forms a relationship with a young woman, Naoko Satomi (Miori Takimoto).As expected from a Miyazaki film the animation is of highest quality, being both detailed and imaginative, a talented voice cast, emotional characters and a brilliant music score. Though there are some dream sequences, The Wind Rises is a mostly grounded affair as Jiro wants success in his career and tells a more serious, melodramatic story. There is little humour, with the comic relief coming from Jiro's boss, Kurokawa (Masahiko Nishimura) who has a particularly funny line near the end of the film.The Wind Rises is set over a long period, from 1918 to the 1930s and Miyazaki shows the changing socio-economics of Japan in this period. Buildings, technology, transport and even fashion change in this period. There are juxtapositions of the modern and the traditional, people either wearing Western suits or traditional Japanese dress, the contrast of the railways to people using horse and carts in rural areas, people moving from the countryside to the cities and even the use of oxens to transport planes to the airfield. The Wind Rises shows Japan as a developing country and the social issues it was suffering.The sequence of the Great Kant Earthquake is superbly done, showing the affects of the fire on Tokyo, the displacement of people and the panic it caused, reminiscent of The Impossible. The side effect of the event was it allowed Tokyo to modernise, redevelop and become a European like city.Miyazaki's anti-war politics is prevalent throughout this film, coming in many forms. There are debates about the military-industrial complex with the money being spend on Japan's armed forces whilst people are living in poverty and foreshadowing of the upcoming war Japan is about to face. Hindsight is a wonderful gift. There are visual realisations of this showing dream sequences of fire bombings, being a sign of the future aerial warfare and its effects, particularly on Japan.Yet Miyazaki does add some moral greys as characters do debate that great things come from suffering and some of humanity's greatest advances have come as a by-product of warfare.It is a great shame that Miyazaki has chosen to retire as he is a fantastic filmmaker who has made some truly wonderful films during his career. The Wind Rises is sombre, interesting film telling the story of a man's passion for both his craft and his love, but it does not join the heights of Miyazaki's filmography.3.5/5Please visit www.rocknreelreviews.com"
104,The Wind Rises,8,28 April 2014,Miyazaki's Swan Song,"Hayao Miyazaki has already gone down as one of the great, if not greatest, animated filmmakers of all time. With The Wind Rises, he chooses to end his glorious career which featured the likes of Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. Unlike Clint Eastwood, Miyazaki is apparently sticking to his retirement statement and making way for new animators, instead of staying around far past his welcome (although I think it is agreed that that wouldn't ever be the case.) The Wind Rises is a feast for the eyes. I have not seen this beautiful of animation for quite some time. Yet, curiously for his final film, it is his most naturalistic. There aren't any floating castles, monsters, or lovable creatures, but instead we get a grounded group of animated humans who feel completely real. Considering it is a fictionalized biography, which is also curious since it isn't really normal to have animated biopics, we cannot exactly stray into the unnatural, except for the dream sequences. The film follows the life of Jirô Horikoshi, who wants nothing more in life than to build beautiful aircrafts. We see him from a young age fascinated by anything that flies. His dreams are filled with the impending doom that aircraft would bring, as well as visions of the future of flight. The story begins in 1918, which isn't really clear in the movie, and by the end we are in 1932. One of the few qualms I had with this film is we are left to do the math ourselves as to the ages of our characters, because after the brief prologue in 1918, the characters look basically the same age, while we receive hints as to how much time is passed. It is a tale filled with love, change, war, and disaster, a truly ""epic"" animated film in my books. The English voice-cast includes the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Mandy Patinkin, and Stanley Tucci, each providing a totally unique voice for the lovable array of characters. Martin Short does the voice of the short-stature superior of Jirô, who looks basically like a male version of Edna Mode from The Incredibles. I will say that film struggles in its script. Some of the nuances are lost in translation and prove to be more cheesy in English than they probably would in Japanese which leads to some awkward dialog situations. The other problem is that the script feels like it is too coincidental and accepting. Some of the instances feel rash and occasionally a character's actions and behaviors feel rather foolish and ignorant about what is actually going on, but then again it is an animated film and it doesn't really take too much away from the film as a whole.Yet, in the end the film raises questions, just like the questions raised in Jirô as he realizes the things he is building are being used for war. Does creating our dream, even if it is causing pain through someone else, really constitute as a success after all? This is the guilt that Jirô eventually has to wrestle with as he begins to see that money, greed, power and war all can use things of beauty to create the exact opposite. It is painful watching something as elegant as an airplane be used for such destructive purposes, but even Miyazaki can still make it pleasureful for the eyes to watch. The Wind Rises is truly Miyazaki's swan song. His fans can rest easy knowing he ended on his consistent high note. Yet, it is sad that the world will no longer be graced by his indelible charm and ability to suck you into his worlds and letting you experience and feel things when you least expect to. You never want to leave the world's he creates, they are so engrossing and inviting that you cannot help but feel like they should go on forever. Maybe that is why we do not receive any information at the end of the film regarding the fates of our characters, so the spirit of the Jirô, like the films of Miyazaki, could live on forever without really coming to an end. He made the choice of making this his last film, and he, like Jirô, succeeded in creating his dreams, every single one of those magical thoughts that will not soon be forgotten by those who have fallen in love with his library of great works. So, if you want to see the last film of one of the most prolific and consistently masterful filmmakers, go check this one out, you won't regret it. For more reviews, check out Ragingfilm.com"
105,The Wind Rises,9,2 March 2014,"Ghibli delivers, always.","Need a movie about War, Love, and Life? This is what you need, emphasize the 'need'. Once again Miyazaki brings history to life and even more beautiful than you can ever imagine. You'll sit in awe as the world opens around you with this amazing historical story. You might as well be in the film next to the characters, as always, they seem alive, practically talking to you, the story and conversations will pull you in. Not to mention the art is beautiful and breath-taking, as other Ghibli movies have presented, this is just another master-crafted animation film of a young boy named Jiro dreaming of creating airplanes in the times of WWII, it brings you into his life from young to older, in the prime of his career, his love life, and the warring world around him. I would recommend this movie for the whole family, as it may be a stretching two hours, it's worth watching and full of exciting stories and beautiful art. Another favorite and possibly another classic in the works. This may be (or one of) Miyazaki's last films, but he's definitely left a beautiful ending to his career."
106,The Wind Rises,2,4 October 2014,Not the usual pristine animation,"This is probably the worst Ghibli film I've ever seen, and I've seen pretty much all of them. The animation was lacking in a few places, cells not lining up so the lines flickered intermittently. There were also areas where the character anatomy was poor, making the characters look as if their arms or legs were too short for their bodies, or their faces looked deformed. The story itself was dull, and the main character was a bore. Honestly, I got the impression that Miyazaki thought this guy was so amazing, he didn't need to 'sell' the character to us, his amazingness would do it all on its own. I found the dream scenes with the Italian plane-designer boring and they added very little to the story-line. The way the MC treated his wife I found quite appalling, and I also found him to be a bit selfish. There was very little mention of WW2, and when the MC was followed by the secret police, he seemed rather unconcerned by this fact. The ending was the worst part of all, it felt as though Miyazaki just tacked the bit on with his wife's spirit because he forgot to wrap up her death and was reminded by another staff member to shove it in there otherwise the audience might get confused. The scene where the MC offers the children the cake in the street was pointless. I was just glad to get out of the cinema by the time the movie was over, it was that droll. Perhaps I am being a little fussy about the animation, but when I am accustomed to the flawless, beautiful animation that Ghibli is capable of, it was such a let down to see schoolboy errors cropping up in this movie. The storyline was a chore. I can see this movie was basically Miyazaki's aeroplane-masturbation project, and that's fine if that's what he wants to do, it's just as well it is his last movie because I won't be going to see another movie by him after this crap."
107,The Wind Rises,3,12 July 2014,"Losing Hayao Miyazaki character in this ""worst animate"" movie","i just hate the way this movie animated. i've watch all of hayao miyazaki movies .. castle in the sky, spirited away, porco rosso, also legendary totoro and many more.the way i became a fans of you ""hayao miyazaki"" its because THE STORY becoming more and more strong feeling strong soul inside the 2D animate.not like this title, 3D rendered in 2D ways ?.. it doesn't make the story becoming more great, more feelings. it just make audience not concentrated to the red line of story.. they were distract by these animate.thats why,The wind Rises is the most awful movies that i have ever watch as your fans Mr. Hayao Miyazaki.even i still lose myself when i see credits. with your dramatic scoring, dramatic music its always awesome.i just regret that you should leave your character away. i miss your old movies grandpa ..About Story ?.. i don't think it was a weak plot btw. story can become anything, everything. just somehow this story become bad because the animate."
108,The Wind Rises,2,15 June 2017,the worst Miyazaki's movie,"Comparing to his other fantastic movies, this movie doesn't have any complex abstract concept. The theme is love to work and family, and is like reading a novel about love and war. The theme by itself looks fine but in practice it couldn't catch the audience eye to follow it to the end. It has similarities to Whisper of the heart, with fewer ideas.Not suggested for first Miyazaki movie watcher. It would be better to start from the best ones Spirited away and Princess Mononoke.Great people do mistakes!"
109,The Wind Rises,10,12 May 2014,Good cap-off for Hayao Miyazaki,"I saw this film and it was great. It is an exceptional swansong of Hayao Miyazaki, which many people consider to be one of the best animated directors of all time, not only famous in Japan, but around the world as well. Studio Ghibli will never be the same without him. Still, I wish Studio Ghibli the best in the future.The story is very well written, the animation is gorgeous, the voices consisting of Neon Genesis Evangelion creator and director, Hideaki Anno (Jiro Horikoshi), Hidetoshi Nishijima (Honjo), Mansai Nomura (Giovanni Battista Caproni), Mirai Shida (Kayo Horikoshi), Miori Takimoto (Naoko Satomi), Morio Kazama (Naoko's father), Masahiko Nishimura (Kurokawa), Jun Kunimura (Hattori), Keiko Takeshita (Jiro's mother), Shinobu Otake (Kurokawa's wife) and Stephen Alpert (Castrop) is great, the music is good, all and worth watching. Another positive is that this movie is a massive improvement of the horrible predecessor of Hayao Miyazaki, Ponyo on the Cliff of the Sea.I strongly recommend you watch this movie, at least watch the original Japanese version with subtitles, devoid of any abysmal and stupid Hollywood intervention, known as the dreaded English-language versions of Ghibli films, which are much, much worse than the direct to video Disney sequels, the dubs proudly hold the title as the worst Disney movement ever, and that is saying a lot. At least the sequels are separated from the original films like The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea is a completely different film from its predecessor, where the Studio Ghibli English-language abominations have nothing good about them whatsoever, using English language cast members to mutilate the film considerably and beyond repair, considering the fact that it is the exact same movie in a visual sense. Not to mention, it also shows favouritism for localised stars that were simply used just for translation."
110,The Wind Rises,10,18 April 2014,Best animated movie I've ever seen,"""The wind rises"" definitely deserve a 10. Before watching the movie, I didn't know anything about its director Mr. Miyazaki, and I didn't see any of his movies either. I only knew that ""The wind rises"" is his farewell to the public, and I couldn't care less. In the beginning, the movie was a little boring to me, and I was disappointed at first. I even thought that it was a mistake to watch a boring Japanese movie like that. (fyi, I had not been patient enough to watch a Japanese animated movie before). However, the story kept getting better. After all, all the scenes are extremely calm and beautiful. The story line is super intelligent. When I finished watching it, I was speechless since I couldn't find words to describe the movie. It is indescribably beautiful. It is a masterful movie that deserves wider audience."
111,The Wind Rises,8,17 April 2014,Simply a Masterpiece,"When i heard that this movie didn't win the Academy Award i was truly and utterly stunned, Some people say that this movie is a celebration of Japan in WW2 and they would also be incorrect, The Wind Rises is the story and celebration of the Life of his parents, Kastsuji Miyazaki (Hayao Miyazaki's father) was, like Jiro in the movie, an Aircraft engineer who built planes and lived with Hayao's mother Dola Miyazaki who developed Spinal Tuberculosis, His Parents despite his mothers illness lived happy and fulfilling lives together and celebrated each other through their love and devotion, This is the Final Masterpiece of a man who as once again has shown us that the true beauty of our lives is the journey and not the destination, The Wind Rises truly captures this sentiment and how it is how we celebrate the ones in our lives that makes us who we are, told by a man's passion and devotion to the work he does, and that is a Masterpiece."
112,The Wind Rises,10,7 March 2014,Miyazaki's best of best,"First things' first, the movie is not for kids (unlike its Oscar nominated comrade 'Frozen'), it's monster-, ghost-and magic- and sentimental lust free. It's based off Jiro Horikoshi's life story, one most prominent airplane designer during the second world war, gently paced  maybe 20 minutes too long for each scene, but I'd say it's worthy, given the exquisite work put in every small detail of the film. It's dreamy, tragic, and inexorably strange  a perfect portray of Japanese young generations who aspire to have their dream fulfilled and live their life the way they wish during turbulent times of history. In this movie, Jiro is one emblem for this spirit but stands as a significant individual. He dreams of one day creating flying machines that would excel those built by the German. His country would, then, use those machines to bomb deaths and destructions on its enemies, but that's not the target Jiro aims either.His dream of flight is what that awakes him on his sleepless nights, and to which the young designer gives too much thought. From an early age, Jiro has always been keen on those English-language aeronautical magazines. During the movie, the usual portray of the young designer is Jiro himself discussing fervently over his favourite subject with an imaginary Italian aircraft designer called Caproni. Caproni serves more of an implication to Jiro's obsession than a real character, but even the seemingly vague character like Caproni is well- developed, which, I believe, adds an alternate dimension to the flow of the movie where physics is malleable and the unimaginable becomes real, where Hayao Miyazaki's playful imagination stretches, just as what we have already seen in his other movies.What appeals to me most is the carpe diem throughout the movie. To follow one's dream would, as poet Paul Valery says, be to ""try to live despite the rising wind"" (Le vent se lève, il faut tenter de vivre). The wind has become a focal point through which Miyazaki leers his lenses and therefore, attracts the viewers, making it hard not to notice. Jiro met his other half, Nahoko Satomi, the first time as a gust of wind blew embers into the sky. They conversed shortly and then departed. The second occasion began on a sweeping fall afternoon, underneath the flaming maple tree where the wind, again, brought these two together. The wind would then witness their hurried marriage before Nahoko ceased to live. It's heart-breaking, true, but then looking back on the message in the first place, everything certainly makes so much sense: if Nahoko is the wind, to swiftly come and go, Jiro must live nevertheless, to make his dream come true.The movie ends with the scene on which Jiro successfully fulfills his lifelong dream  the birth of an unbeatable flying beast that rages on the sky for half-decade during the brutal war. I cannot stress it enough but this movie is much more than what I could ever conceive when first watching its trailer on Youtube almost one and a half years ago. Damn crazy, Ghibli! There's a slim chance that ""The Wind Rises"" receives this year's Oscar but now that it's too good a movie to have ever been created and to be appreciated by the mass, I don't really mind much about Oscar any longer. 10 stars definitely!"
113,The Wind Rises,,3 March 2014,"A beautiful animation, like its planes.","""The wind is rising! We must try to live!"" Paul ValeryThe Wind Rises has two stories: the story of Jiro Horikoshi (voice of Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who designed the Japanese Zero, arguably the most effective fighter plane in WWII, or at least the most feared; and the story of love for his tubercular young wife, Nahoko (Emily Blunt). The animated planes soar like beautiful birds, and his love soars in a similarly graceful, albeit short, arc like a sweeping wing.The genial director, Hayao Miyazaki, who has so imaginatively shown us flying pigs and castles and other unworldly things, comes down to earth with a gentle bio and a love story so unlike Frozen it's no wonder Wind did not beat it in the Oscar race. The slow pace of the film, so different from our quick cutting, cookie cutting stories, gives everyone a chance to think about the deep issues in the film, but it could make American audiences squirm with impatience.The real world of Japanese war mongers who used Jiro's design to foment war contrasts with the idealism of a gifted aeronautical engineer who loved only flight, not fight.Miyazaki's recent death, making this arguably his last work, highlights his brilliance: Cat buses can give way to airplanes, from a director whose dad owned an airplane factory. Miyazaki left a legacy of intelligence and romance for animation. Perhaps the wind rises is also the story of the director himself, whose spirit rose like a prevailing wind. The genius Italian flight designer Caproni (Stanley Tucci) best expresses the film's amalgam of romance and realism: ""Airplanes are just cursed dreams, waiting for the sky to swallow them up."""
114,The Wind Rises,10,2 March 2014,Beautiful,"This movie was simply amazing. The reality of wars, dreams, romance... Some parts of it are rather surreal, though - it's definitely more ""artistic"" than any of Miyazaki's other films, a lot of the messages being rather implicit and thought provoking. But that's precisely why I loved it so much. Really, this move is an incredibly fitting end to Miyazaki's career, epitomizing nearly all the themes he's included in his work throughout his over sixty years in the field in this one mature, beautifully crafted film.I can't really find anything else about it to say without going off on a tangent about the whole movie. Suffice it to say, it's not a movie for everyone. I went to see it with a friend who was fairly confused by the time we got out and didn't really understand why I was crying so much."
115,The Wind Rises,10,9 April 2014,It's all about perspective.,"This is more like a brief analysis of the film...""The Wind Rises"" directed by Hayao Miyazaki has received very controversial reviews. This film has been given poor reviews by many reviewers. Perhaps more from the younger generation than the veterans. I understand their reasoning, because I am also part of the younger generation. It is only natural that those in the spring time of life, crave a more thrilling, stimulating content. And it's understandable that that's what they would expect from the respectable Hayao Miyazaki, whose previous films were fanciful and eccentric, accentuated by their imaginative plots that can be described as everything but grounded.But I want you to remember, films aren't made entirely to entertain. Hayao Miyazaki had a goal and purpose in making this movie, and it was not to create a 2 hour sit-com. Nor was it to make a movie that mothers could use to distract their children while they did their house-work. I think ""The Wind Rises"" was directed toward a mature audience. It has depth and an insightful message that can by viewed differently from different perspectives. Perhaps that is why it roused many contrasting outlooks.One reviewer stated, ""This was a time when young men were forced to die in the battlefields, never allowed to even have a dream except dying for the country."" Indeed that may have been the country's ideal, but it doesn't entirely stop people from dreaming. Jiro Horikoshi(the protagonist of the film) was one of those dreamers. While accepting and understanding the harsh realities of his country's situation during the war, he continues to pursue his dream of creating an air-born masterpiece. You can notice the subtle changes he undergoes, as well as his constant yearning to succeed.As for the storyline, it's true that at times it was a bit hard to follow. The movie was episodic, and went from scene to scene in a manner than the viewer has to assume the time that has passed. To some, it can be a little hard to get a hold of. But that is just another style that director Miyazaki used to incorporate realism and the pace of time passing through this man's life. Miyazaki's former movies usually extended throughout a time period from a few days to a month. ""The Wind Rises"" portrayed a young man's life through multiple years.""Melodramatic,"" you say? At first look, yes it will seem clichéd. Jiro is spontaneously reunited with a bright and beautiful girl from long ago(which he, by the way, graciously saved the life of) and they fall madly in love. But alas! The girl has a life-threatening illness that makes her weak and bed-ridden. Love prevails and the lovers get married, but in result the girl grows frail and sickly day by day. She leaves a letter to her beloved and secretly escapes to the hospital to die. At first glance, it is pretty sappy...Aha but wait, this movie was deeply metaphorical. Every simple action had a greater meaning to it, in which the audience had to interpret by themselves. What may have seemed to be the brashness of an ignorant girl, actually had a more meaningful motive. How you interpret it is all up to yourself and your values and outlook on life. This movie will make you think. And you should, or else you will probably miss the greatness that you would have come across.As for the graphics, they were beyond excellence. I cannot describe how brilliant the screen was in each and every scene. Adding to that, I have never come across a negative comment about the visuals.""Flight,"" ""sky,"" ""dreams,"" ""life,"" these are topics that are frequently used in Miyazaki's films. Embraced by all of these values, ""The Wind Rises"" is an extremely symbolic movie. While the film received a lot of negative comments it also gained positive views, with equal or increased passion. I will always remember this film and all it's greatness. Acted out by cute, animated figures, was a poetic portrayal of humanities struggles and efforts. It uses its place and era to it's fullest to cleverly weave into half the life time of a single man. I think it is more than worthy of a second look."
116,The Wind Rises,7,1 March 2014,Mixed feelings about it; like with all of  Miyazaki's other movies.,"'THE WIND RISES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Hayao Miyazaki directed and wrote this Japanese historical fantasy film based on his manga of the same name. Miyazaki's comic is loosely based on the short story 'The Wind Has Risen' (by Tatsuo Hori, a mid-20th century Japanese writer and poet) and tells the fictionalized tale of a Japanese World War II aircraft designer who helped create the Mitsubishi A5M and Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The movie is nominated for 'Best Animated Feature' at the 2014 Academy Awards and has been raved about by critics (it was also the highest grossing film in Japan last year). I found it to be a lot like Miyazaki's other films ('PRINCESS MONONOKE' and 'SPIRITED AWAY' to name a few); bizarrely interesting and extremely creative but also slow paced and uninvolving. The American voice cast includes actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Martin Short, Stanley Tucci, Mandy Patinkin, William H. Macy, Mae Whitman, Jennifer Grey and Werner Herzog. Gordon-Levitt voices Jirô Horikoshi, a revolutionary aircraft designer for Japan during World War II. As a child Jirô dreamed of being a pilot but decided to become an airplane engineer instead due to his nearsightedness. He gets the idea after having (what he believes is) a shared dream with the famous Italian plane designer named Caproni. The film chronicles his adventures following his dreams as well as a relationship he develops with a young girl, named Nahoko (Blunt), he meets on a train to Tokyo (during the 'Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923').The movie has received a lot of criticism for making a war-plane designer it's hero; also the fact that a lot of those planes were built by Chinese and Korean workers who were forced into it (it's also been criticized for the heavy smoking the heroes do in it). These are all subjects that are pretty mature for a children's animated movie but it is rated PG-13 in America and the fact that it's geared towards adults is what makes it so appealing to a lot of people. Like Miyazaki's other films though it's also intended for kids, which is one of the things I don't like about these movies; it transitions between children's fantasy cartoon and mature adult subject matter too easily. It seems like it wants to be taken as a serious character drama but then it's also filled with cheesy cartoon dialogue (and the characters aren't believable as real world people). That's what makes these films so intriguing and popular with Miyazaki's fans though. I have mixed feelings about it (like with all of his other movies).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NdCvPRYk4"
117,The Wind Rises,7,5 March 2014,Sponge cake from the guy who brought us Pearl Harbor . . .,". . . distributed to you by Disney Megacorp, headquartered in California, the state which prides itself on having more people driving Mitsubishi cars than any other, because, they say, ""We value Japanese engineering: look what it did to Pearl Harbor."" THE WIND RISES, a ""highly fictionalized"" (say the experts) animated biography of the chap (Jiro Horikoshi) behind the Mitsubishi A6M Zeros that destroyed Pearl Harbor, written and directed by the inventor of the marathon cartoon--Hayao Miyazaki--ends with the Surprise Attack Enabler entering Heaven!! He is shown hanging out with Mussolini, Hitler, and Hirohito's technical henchmen throughout his Pre-War life; then he tells the Italian one who meets him at the Pearly Gates (instead of St. Peter) that his big regret is that NO Mitsubishi Zero returned to the Japanese mainland intact as WWII drew to a close. This 126-minute biography does NOT include one second of footage of Mitsubishi Zeros in attack mode; instead it shows Mr. Horikoshi daydreaming, chasing rainbows, flying paper airplanes, fretting over a sick sweetie, and passing out sponge cake to poor kids (there is no historical proof he did any of these things; I've personally done ALL of them, except the sponge cake part--my own food donations for the poor always have been more nutritious than that). On the other hand, there is no disputing that the Mitsubishi A6M Zeros were created for one purpose: to kill as many American men, women, and children as possible! If Californians in general and Disney lackeys in particular want to celebrate that, go right ahead. For the moment, it's sort of a ""free country,"" since America conquered Mr. Horikoshi's Death Machines. I only saw this because it was nominated for an Oscar, and I figured it might be a better version of Pokemon. The lesson to be taken is to read ALL the user reviews BEFORE spending scarce American money to subsidize mendacious revisionism! (Don't be surprised if Mr. Miyazaki builds upon the ""success"" of THE WIND RISES, and buys the cartoon rights from Mel Brooks to SPRINGTIME FOR H!TLER.)"
118,The Wind Rises,5,24 July 2017,"A Visually Appealing, Poorly Written Animated Biography","The Wind Rises follows Jiro Horikoshi, a man who designed fighter planes during World War II.As per usual, Studio Ghibli creates a beautiful looking movie here. The animation is breathtaking, with the scenery being gorgeous to gawk at and the animation itself fluent. More importantly, the first half of the story and almost everything revolving around planes is really well written. The main character, Jiro, is interesting and well-written. The way he acts is realistic, and it's easy to believe that this guy actually existed. I went into this movie not knowing it was about planes. By the look of the poster art, I thought it was a romance. For the whole first hour and a bit I was just waiting for that to start. The first bit wasn't bad by any means, but I felt like there was more waiting, like we were wasting time or developing characters to make a more effective last act. Then the romantic aspect started and I remember audibly telling the movie ""no stop, go back!"" It was awful. The characters don't spend nearly enough time together on screen to form any chemistry or relationship, and then suddenly they're getting married. It's out of nowhere and I really didn't care at all for their relationship. After that it keeps switching between romance and planes. Again, the planes stuff is cool, but the romance is awful. And this is where the movie gets particularly stupid. Characters make decisions that make no sense whatsoever. I get it, this is based on true events and maybe these decisions were actually made for these reasons, but I don't care about the source material. Make it less accurate for the sake of making a good movie, I don't care. Don't paint this character as a genius then turn him idiot for the last act, it just doesn't make sense. Also the voicing acting is pretty bad. Now I watched the dub, shoot me if you want, I don't care. It's the official dub, so it should hold to the same standard of quality as the original. And it doesn't. Go ahead and tell me to watch the sub because it's 'so much better', but I prefer to watch my movies instead of read them, especially when that option is available professionally. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is awful as Jiro. He's so dull, it's like he's literally reading the script for the first time, not processing a single line and just saying it all. Moreover, John Krasinski as one of his friends is overly excited all the time. And I mean, ALL THE TIME. Yet his character's face looks constantly unimpressed or bored. It's like the voice actors should've been switched. Overall The Wind Rises is not the movie I hoped it'd be. Despite expecting one thing, I enjoyed the other part much more. Only about half this movie is good, and the rest is still littered with no-so- great aspects. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie."
119,The Wind Rises,9,21 February 2015,"A beautiful ""swan song"" from Hayao Miyazaki","As a fan of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, The Wind Rises is not one of their best(Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, Castle in the Sky, Whisper of the Heart), let down by some overly-languid pacing and some wooden voice-work from Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It is however a great and beautiful film and quite easily along with Disney's Frozen one of the best animated films of 2013.The best thing about The Wind Rises is the animation, if there was one word to sum it up it would be exquisite. It is filled with Ghibli's characteristic meticulous and loving attention to detail, and it's not just luscious in colour and elegantly smooth in background art but it is also incredibly expressive. Joe Hisaishi's music score is also stunning, ethereally orchestrated and nimble in mood, it's also thankfully the antithesis of over-bearing, the gentle approach it has gives the film intimacy. The script is thoughtful and never preachy, and it doesn't get complicated either and the story while languidly paced and not the most imaginative that Miyazaki and Ghibli have come up with is very personal, charming and very affectionate. I did find myself very moved by the ending, then again this is hardly the first time where this viewer has gotten emotional watching a film. The reason for this being that the film deals with some very personal issues and explores them so movingly and mind-hauntingly. Miyazaki's direction is nuanced and intricate, the characters are engaging if more in the supporting roles than the leads(Caproni being the most memorable). The voice acting is quite good, though one of Ghibli's weakest dubbed films, reservations are had about Levitt but Emily Blunt is very compassionate and Martin Short, Mae Whitman and especially Stanley Tucci stand out in roles that all three give a lot of personality to.All in all, Ghibli and Miyazaki have done better, but The Wind Rises is still a great film, one of the best animated films of 2013, and a beautiful ""swan song"" from Miyzaki. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
120,The Wind Rises,10,13 December 2014,"If this is indeed Hayao Miyazaki's last film, he leaves on a high note","This is an animated feature written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and done by Studio Ghibli. There will be spoilers ahead:This is a highly fictionalized film about Jiro Horikoshi, an aeronautical engineer who designed fighter planes for Japan, including the Zero. Jiro's personal life is highly fictionalized in the film, but that scarcely matters.The film is just beautiful from start to finish. The animation, the backgrounds, the character design, the music, the dream sequences, the editing, the film is truly a work of art.Jiro's dream is to build beautiful planes. That they will be used for destructive purposes troubles him, but he designs planes for the same reason he breathes-because he has to do so. He's a brilliant engineer born to design planes. Repeatedly, he slips into dreams, some during sleep, some as daydreams and the dreams are beautiful. The plot flows smoothly, the fictionalized story of his personal life is to provide some additional drama and romance.While I liked Frozen and thought it was an excellent film on its own merits, I think this deserved to win the Academy Award for Animated Feature instead. Oh well, such is life. They're both worthy works.This is available on DVD and Blu-Ray and is absolutely breathtaking, particularly on Blu-Ray. Most highly recommended."
121,The Wind Rises,8,22 November 2014,Another great film by Miyazaki,"Anime master Hayao Miyazaki purportedly last film is a biopic on Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of several planes used by Japan during World War II. I quite like this unusual film, even though there is seemingly not much in the plot: our protagonist daydreams as a child of being a airplane designer, survives the 1923 Tokyo earthquake, enters as a young engineer the Mitsubishi airplane firm, goes to Germany to study the Junkers planes, returns to Japan and builds better and better planes that will be eventually used in World War II. (Miyazaki clearly loves WW2 era airplanes: they were already the subject of his previous ""Porco Rosso"", which I found a weak effort when I saw it some years ago).Being a Miyazaki film, it would be redundant to dwell too much on the incredible artistry involved. While watching this, it dawn on me that even though engineering is very important and in facts permeates the modern world, there are very few movies (or novels or stage plays, for that matter) with an engineer as a protagonist. Part of this, I believe, is a culture clash between artists and engineers. I think engineers by temperament and personality tend to be responsible and well grounded, quite the opposite traits of bohemian artists, who tend to find them boring as well as social and political conformists. Unlike scientists, they are not even seen as eccentrics. In the artists' eyes, engineers are not good material either for heroes or villains.Back to the film, perhaps the only important flaw in the movie is that it becomes so defensive at the end on the fact that his planes were used in a war. Well, of course, they were, as did the planes of other countries in the conflict.Summing up, this is not probably the very best film of Miyazaki, but it is very well worth watching."
122,The Wind Rises,8,16 November 2014,"Long and often very draggy, but richly animated and with moments of pure joy.  Average dubbing though.","I've always been a huge fan of Miyazaki ever since I first saw KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, but for his supposed swan song, I honestly don't know what to think. Perhaps because of this, I cannot rate it as highly as his other films. Don't get me wrong, THE WIND RISES is not a bad film at all. It's as colorful and beautifully animated as any Ghibli movie, and of course Joe Hisaishi's music is sublime. There are also moments that truly do recall Miyazaki at his most imaginative. But if you're expecting another movie filled with action, wonders, and magic as his other movies, you will probably be disappointed, because THE WIND RISES is as far removed from the rest of Miyazaki's output than even his less fantasy-oriented pictures. Rather than aiming for the exuberant joy and wonders of LAPUTA, TOTORO, the dark, epic spectacles of MONONOKE, NAUSICAA, and even the surrealistic SPIRITED AWAY and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, this movie is mostly down to earth, with only the occasional moments of pure spectacle. It's also his most ""adult"" film to date; perhaps because of this, THE WIND RISES is also cursed with the misfortune of being Miyazaki's least accessible film.Although financially successful in Japan, THE WIND RISES has not been without its share of detractors, particularly Miyazaki's target audience. Controversially, the protagonist of this story is Jiro Horikoshi, the man who was responsible for creating some of deadliest airplane bombers during World War II. In fact, this film is very loosely based on his account. Naturally, one would expect that Horikoshi would be portrayed as a tyrant considering the outcome of his crafts. But in a rather daring and almost dangerous move, Miyazaki presents the man as a gentle, ambitious soul who simply wants to achieve his dream of flying rather than as a psychopath bent on destruction.Speaking of dreams, the most memorable sequences in the movie are those which involve Jiro's fantasies of being airborne. In one such scene, an extensive, dialogue-free prologue which opens the film, we see young Jiro wake up from his countryside home, climb to the roof and board an elaborately customized craft, soaring across the Japanese countryside to the strains of Joe Hisaishi's typically melodic score. Otherwise, the rest of the ""dream"" scenes (interspersed throughout the languidly paced story) feature Jiro interacting with the charismatic Italian aircraft designer Caproni. ""Airplanes are beautiful dreams,"" intones the air designer to the short-sighted Jiro who he refers to as ""Japanese boy"", ""Engineers turn dreams into reality.""For the rest of the film, we follow Jiro as he grows into adulthood; a forty-year cycle of a journey that unfolds in over two hours. Regrettably, this is also one of the film's biggest shortcomings: not only are the scenes involving Jiro's growth less intriguing than his flights of fancy, they slow the movie's momentum to a snail's pace. Miyazaki is no stranger to producing movies that push over the two hour mark, but THE WIND RISES feels even longer than that, with most of the scenes being slow, drawn-out conversations between Jiro and his colleagues.Aside from the aforementioned ""imagination"" bits, the only other major highlight of THE WIND RISES happens about a third of the way through in which an earthquake literally tears through Japan and causes a passing train to derail and crash spectacularly. This is arguably my favorite moment of the movie because it showcases Miyazaki at his most visceral. The execution of the tragedy is powerfully conveyed through the dramatic staging and animation.Alas, such moments are tragically undercut by the film's much more languid second half, which shoehorns a tragic love story involving a gentle painter woman whose internal clock is ticking. I don't know if it is just me, but neither Jiro nor his lover Naoko come across as particularly compelling characters, and perhaps because of this, we are given little reason to care about them. A ""courting"" scene in which Jiro attempts to fly a paper airplane to Naoko's balcony is inspiring, but that's about as interesting as this love story gets.More detrimental, unfortunately, is the dub by Disney, which is surprisingly disappointing considering I've always loved the studio's English work for Ghibli's films. Sadly, this is their worst, the performance I found to be the weakest being that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Although well cast, he proves, I'm sorry to say, the dullest performance in any Disney dub I've ever listened to. Emily Blunt fares a little better as Naoko, but the love scenes between her and Levitt are shockingly ineffective: however much emotion Blunt gives, Levitt's distressingly wooden performance sadly nullifies any bit of chemistry between the two. That said, I did enjoyed Martin Short, Mae Whitman, Stanley Tucci, and Werner Hertzop's turns -- all four are terrific, especially Short's delightfully irascible Kurotowa and the charismatic, charming Tucci as Caproni. But everyone else didn't strike me as compelling one way or another.Perhaps another major problem I have is the ending; while the fate of the love story isn't hard to guess, but Miyazaki instead chooses to close the film with yet another dream sequence. Instead of coming across as a genuine conclusion, this last scene feels strangely unresolved. What happens to Jiro after the scene? What became of his career? Sadly, the movie doesn't answer any of these questions, and as such, the denouement doesn't feel like a genuine conclusion. It's almost as if Miyazaki ran out of creative juice and decided to stop his movie on an uneasy note.Still, take my complaints with a grain of salt and go see THE WIND RISES. Even if it is by no means Miyazaki's best film, the moments that truly excel really show that a genius such as Miyazaki never ceases to amaze, whether at his most vigorous or his most down to earth."
123,The Wind Rises,7,23 October 2014,Good Animation,"Animation is not always just for kids, as Fans of Anime from Japan already know. There are different styles obviously and while the theme here is not an adult one, it is a mature one in the sense of a big and somewhat complex story. This movie could have also have worked as a feature drama (and you might have seen similar played out scenarios already yourself).The animation is what we are used from Japan (which is high quality ""drawn""), the characters and the story lines are weaving together over a long period of time, with war lingering in the background and almost overshadowing personal events and happenings. The filmmaker takes his audience serious and it shows in the final product."
124,The Wind Rises,7,10 September 2014,"Original, but I'd say it's the 2nd best animated movie of 2014.  Oscars got it right.","Many people wanted this movie to win the Oscar, but for me it was Frozen all along as the clear winner, and here's why:The Wind Rises, above all else, has an amazing artistic background, and is the clear-cut standout feature of the film. It had an all- star cast, who were capable of brilliant acting, and that right there is the biggest problem with this movie: subpar acting. The storyline was brilliant, the plot was there, there was a love story involved. I do think it could have gone a little deeper storywise, but the story in and of itself was better than Frozen. The problems rests solely on the monotonous tones of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, John Krasinski, & Emily Blunt. Martin Short, who played Kujakwara, Jiro's boss, was the only character with any intonation in his voice. For someone who was supposed to be passionately involved in both airplanes and a woman, Gordon-Levitt was stale, and displayed about a 2/10 in terms of emotion acting. Blunt probably had a 4/10, and Krasinski was a 0/10. The musical score was unique, but played only in transitional stages and not in backgrounds of conversation. That can be OK, if the emotion is there to subdue it, but it was not there.Frozen, meanwhile, was entertaining throughout, with almost exaggerated emotion, had a musical-style feel, and a comedic presence that was unmatched until Lego Movie arrived in the following months. It had nice animation and, but it was mostly CGI, whereas The Wind Rises felt like authentic artwork. The actors actually acted; The Wind Rises felt like people reading a script. While I personally preferred the Soundtrack to The Wind Rises, Frozen's was more appropriately used, and vastly more memorable.All that said, The Wind Rises isn't even unique, necessarily; anime movies have been done tenfold, just not in the U.S. It is rare to see an all-star cast in an anime movie though. I would still highly recommend this movie, but I don't think it was the best animated film of the year.I am unsure if Lego Movie counted towards the past year's Oscars or will be considered for the upcoming 2015 Oscars, but that movie deserves the best unless another movie proves superior, which I believe is highly doubtful."
125,The Wind Rises,9,23 June 2014,A farewell masterpiece by Mr. Miyazaki.,"Studio Ghibli's latest anime movie. I was totally heart broke when I heard it is Mr. Miyazaki's final movie. Then I was thoroughly prepared to enjoy every piece of it and indeed I did. What a great piece of work as being in his 70s, definitely a farewell masterpiece. A most matured movie, I mean for the first time a movie for grownups that had contents children won't fit in to enjoy from the studio as well from the director.It was just like the movie 'The Aviator'. A boy, Jiro Horikoshi, who aspires to contribute his skills to upgrade the aircraft technology who was actually inspired by the Italian aircraft designer Caproni. At his young age, he excels in the field that leads him to grab an opportunity to work with the nation's most renowned aircraft manufacturer. His life mixed with dreams and reality makes him a better man among his coworker. Everyone believed that he's a workaholic, but he surprises all by falling in love. The movie explained his ambition, passion towards aircrafts and his romantic life as well as the dreams that make him to believe everything is feasible.''Airplanes are beautiful cursed dreams... waiting for the sky to swallow them up''There are very few so far in the history of filmmaking that animation borrowed story from biographies. This was way better than what live shot movie would have offered to the viewers. Especially this story had few dream scenes, like a fantasy that we had seen in 'The Lovely Bones'. Those were really well done, a trademark that usually we find in all of Hayao Miyazaki movies. If you are a fan of his work, then it will be a delightful 2 hour long treat for sure. I had the experience of watching this like watching the final match of the FIFA world cup. I could never ask better than this.Kind of inspiring theme about engineering work and a message teller about non-violence. That this movie was set during the world war, including Japan's involvement in the affair. So there were many dialogues that delivers against the idea of war, like, the famous Caproni regrets that his invention was misused in the wars. The movie had lots of smoking scenes, as it sets in and around the 20s that was fine because people did in those times. After all, like I said earlier, it is for adult, even if parents allow their kids to watch they may fall in boredom. So I see there's no controversy to drag on.''Engineers turn dream into reality''There were few sentiments, it appeals strongly during the end portion. The end also leaves lots of questions about what could have happened afterwards, especially Jiro's Romance life. Someway it gives the impression of happy ending and in another way slightly hurts. A finely balanced grand finale. Those were the seconds (the time) I was not desired for because no more Miyazaki's movie to see afterwards. I believed the end of a great era of him and studio Ghibli together. Overall, gives the satisfaction of watching a man's true story, his romantic life, involvement in achieving the dream and got a place in his country's history. Now the director showed it to the rest of the world in a beautiful manner. Thank you Hayao Miyazaki for all your contributions, I always keep loving your great works. Enjoy your rest of the life."
126,The Wind Rises,9,25 May 2014,"We watch as boyhood dreams become part of reality during a time when reality is bleak, and unrelenting.","Once again Miyazaki, and company, set a precedent which likely won't be matched even by the touching works of Pixar. You go on a journey in which a boy sees his dreams become reality in a time when Japan is in the midst of war, a depression, and oppression from the Germans. But, even with so many morose topics, there is laughter, love, and career accomplishments making for a, seemingly, biographical tale which makes animation seemingly a good medium for future biographical endeavors.Characters & StoryFirst, it should be noted that the film is a work of ""Historical Fiction,"" in a Forrest Gump type of way, but with a smaller time period covered. We begin with Jiro (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as a boy who dreams of creating airplanes, fast forward to him in college when the Great Kanto Earthquake happens, and then again during the time when Japan was an active participant in World War II. Over the course of each portion of his life, he speaks with famous Italian designer Giovanni Caproni (Stanley Tucci), in his dreams, about their mutual love for aircrafts, which unfortunately will not be utilized for travel and the beauty of flying through the air, but instead war.But, while the story does feature the war, Nazis, and other dark subjects, it also has that Forrest Gump element of having a likable lead, and him being surrounded by characters who are all comical in their own way. Be it his boss Kurokawa (Martin Short), whose look alone could draw laughter; his best friend Honjo (John Krasinski) who gets laughs due to his cigarette addiction; or even Jiro's little sister Kayo (Mae Whitman) who is constantly on her brother's case for not being as attentive, or around, as she likes. Also, there is a love interest, Naoko (Emily Blunt), and with her inclusion, it makes the film, and Jiro's story, seem more than ""Historical Fiction"" to the point if someone didn't tell you this was simply based off Jiro Horikoshi's life, you'd believe this was a true ode to the man.PraiseAs noted in the story summary, this film covers a lifetime and through the various characters, and stories within, keeps you interested during the 2 hour film. I would dare even say that after watching a movie like this, I can't see why biopics of the future couldn't be done if not in Studio Ghibli's style, than the more technological dependent methods. And speaking of style, Miyazaki's love for traditional animation is seen in such splendor in this film. From little things like the way water or flowers move, to the giant sized tear drops, everything has Miyazaki's signature style on it, and the story is no different.Like with the film's ability to make you cry, get excited, and really twists your emotions almost as if done on whim. For, between the lovable Jiro, his love interest Naoko, and his various friends and family members, I don't think you can even say that live action characters all get as well developed to the point you genuinely miss them when they are gone, and get excited when they return to the screen.And the last thing I really liked was it felt like a love letter to not just Jiro, but Japan as well. Most of Miyazaki's films are placed in some sort of fantasy world so while they do borrow from Japanese culture, they aren't immersed in it. This film however presents Japan, its culture, and history through Jiro in a way which may not break things down to the point you can understand the whys and hows, but you get a good enough idea to be intrigued enough to do your own research.CriticismFor me, there are only minor issues with the film. The first being that the time length is felt and, outside of that, I would note that some of the sounds used in the film, especially the early parts, sound a bit strange. I'm not sure if they were made from human bodies or archive records, but either way the sounds used are strange enough to take you out of being immersed, if just temporarily.Overall: Worth SeeingDue to the length, I would probably wait until it comes out on VOD/ DVD, but even with that said I think this is definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of animation. For, like Scorsese's Hugo, this is very much a love letter to a pioneer and the love letter also extends, in my opinion, to the country Miyazaki calls home. And with memorable characters, good laughs, a nice romantic plot, and a story which really makes you feel something, I can't recommend this enough. Also, I believe this should win the Academy Award."
127,The Wind Rises,8,12 May 2014,The Wind Rises,"I think 'How's Moving Castle' was the first feature-length film that was announced as being Miyazaki's last. But ten years and two feature films later, has the great director finally decided to call it a day? With 'Ponyo' since being his second last ever film, now 'The Wind Rises' is the next film to make the claim and, given its subject matter and style, is probably as good a place as any to call it a day. Telling the story of real-life human: Japanese aeronautics engineer Horikoshi Jiro, designer of Japanese fighter planes used during the Second World War. Now, this is always going to be a touchy subject matter to tackle and would seemingly be a move away from his previous films. However, Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki himself have previously made films as serious and adult in theme as this. But what this does mean is that some of the more mythical elements of his previous films are not present.With a brief look at his childhood years, the film quickly moves to his time at University before his starting work at the Mitsubishi Internal Combustion Engine Company, where he would start to design war planes. But, fear not. This is not a biopic that could have been made as a live- action film full of dull moments. Looking at his dreams, we follow Jiro's desire to create beautiful flying machines from a young age. But, as the film progresses and the reality of designing planes as an engineer during war time, the dreams become visions of the destruction his creations will bring. Numerous references are made to life's ironies throughout, and this is the one apparent by the film's conclusion. While all of his film's have an appeal to adults as well as children, 'The Wind Rises' feels more adult: less happy in its ending and more along the lines of Ghibli's other wartime film, 'Grave of the Fireflies'. But, the magic is still there. 'The Wind Rises' is positive in its telling of a boy's dream to create what he loves and how Jiro's intentions were only ever to do good, rather than a desire to destroy, ending with an emotional finale, feeling an appropriate place for Miyazaki to call it a day. But, as 'Howl's Moving Castle' and 'Ponyo' have proved, never say 'never.'"
128,The Wind Rises,,10 May 2014,"Miyazaki does it yet again, and possibly for the last time","The Wind Rises, the latest and possibly the last film by the great Hayao Miyazaki, is at the same time utterly typical for its director and something new altogether. Taking place in the real world and containing no fantasy elements whatsoever - a few dream sequences notwithstanding - it feels like a passion project for Miyazaki, something he has been wanting to do for a long time. And you can see a lot of his favourite things in it. Flying, airplanes, early 20th century Italy (though the film takes place in Japan), the effect of industrial revolution on traditions, strong and determined laymen and -women, all that good stuff.The story is at the same time more down to earth as well as grander in scale, passing through years and years while dealing with the issues of war, hardship and what it means to be passionate about something if that passion can be turned against other people. In an essence a film with a lot of depth. Miyazaki's directing and storytelling handle and examine these themes with care and precision. It's forceful and straight to the point when it needs to be, but it's never in your face nor does it ever spout exposition. Yet you're never left wondering what the movie is trying to say. Its message is clear as night and day, yet you get it through your own realization and reading between the lines.The movie is also utterly gorgeous. Beautifully hand-animated by Japan's best, it's full of little details and moments that you could very easily miss if not for the sheer skill which they have been drawn. One of my favourite moments in the film was when a woman walks on a polished wooden floor and you can see her smoky reflection on the floor. Unbelievable animation and for a moment I could have sworn the floor was real and not merely animated.The Wind Rises might not be one of Miyazaki's best films - in my opinion that honour goes either to Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away - but it's still one of the best films I've seen in a while, animated or otherwise. Its story comes straight from its director's heart and its a fitting farewell to one of the best animation directors of all time."
