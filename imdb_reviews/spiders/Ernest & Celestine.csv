0,Ernest & Celestine,10,19 November 2013,Absolutely sublime,"Anybody who loves animation and just want to see one that warms your heart and moves, charms and entertains you, you have met your match with Ernest and Celestine. With me, out of all the films, animated and otherwise, viewed recently Ernest and Celestine stood out as one of the most beautiful. The animation, with its water-colour/ story-book look, is just lovely to look at and is imaginative while keeping things simple. The is sensitively orchestrated and unobtrusive, one of those music scores that you can listen to more than once and still find it memorable and appealing. You can't argue with the way Ernest and Celestine is written, it has a poetic simplicity that children and adults alike can understand with no problem. The unlikely friendship angle is a familiar one but that doesn't matter when Ermest and Celestine deals with it with so much warmth and heart. You can genuinely feel the relationship/friendship between the characters, and throughout the simple but never too simplistic story is both charming and touching, cute as well(I admit it that I did feel a lot of emotion watching). The characters are just as engaging as the writing, you can identify with them and their friendship and situation and it is easy to like them. They are nimbly voiced too. Overall, a sublime animated film that takes a familiar concept and does it with simplicity and doesn't rely on fart jokes, profanities, slapstick or crude toilet humour, instead allowing the story and friendship between the titular characters to come through and come through they do, and marvellously. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
1,Ernest & Celestine,10,23 March 2013,Superior Kiddie toon.,"Genuinely charming cartoon feature from the PANIQUE AU VILLAGE lot.While rummaging through the town's dust bins, Ernest the bear finds sleeping mouse Ernestine and is dissuaded from eating her - whether it's Tom's Jerry, the King Sized Canary or Br'er Rabbit, they never get eaten.The pair are our introduction to the parallel surface world of the bears and the underground world of the mice, both of which prove hostile, though mouse world is one of those appealing fantasy communities, like Santa city in POLAR EXPRESS or the bath house in SPIRITED AWAY. The lead duo are among the most engaging of cartoon characters and their seclusion seems a nice outcome. It would be interesting to see if their appeal survives English language dubbing.The watercolour texture is unfamiliar and imaginative. The music is effectively unobtrusive. It would be hard to fault this one. Why try?"
2,Ernest & Celestine,7,26 October 2013,Film Review: Ernest & Celestine (★★★½),"When we all think of animation and the journey it has walked through, naturally we all go to a big studio like Disney to offer up lots of the credit. Rightfully so, the studio paved the way for companies like Dreamworks and Sony Pictures to dip their feet into the animation arena. One of the quiet and brilliant studios that isn't on the lips of everyone yet is the impressive GKIDS. They made heads turn in the 2009- 2010 awards season when they pushed The Secret of Kells and managed a surprise nomination for Best Animated Feature. In 2011-2012, they pulled a one-two punch with Chico & Rita and A Cat in Paris, snagging nominations as well. For my money, they produced the best animated film of last year with Jean-François Laguionie's The Painting and found no wiggle room to get in over Brave and Wreck-It Ralph.This year, the animation studio is at it again with their captivating French film Ernest & Celestine. Touching all the sweet parts of my cinematic heart, the Daniel Pennac written film tells the story of an unlikely friendship between a grumpy bear and a young mouse. Encompassing the powerful elements of honesty, truth, and acceptance, Pennac's screenplay, once again, fixates on the small details that bring our story full circle and unimaginably to life. It's one of the great surprises of the film year. Pennac is quickly becoming one of my favorite animated film writers working today.One of the qualities that have made other animation studios so successful over the years is easy application of the child-like story that is being told, into the moment of the now and even the adult world. As life above ground includes Ernest, and a race of bears, they are the dominant power on the Earth. Down below, lives a race of mice, fending for survival, and only going to the world above to collect teeth in preparation to become dentists, which all rodents hold. Celestine lives in an orphanage, with a zeal and talent for drawing, she yearns for a world outside though stories are constantly told about the evil world of bears above. Ernest is down on his luck. When Celestine gets chased by a bear family after attempting to take one of the cubs' tooth, she hides in a trash can. When a hungry and desperate Ernest finds Celestine and tries to eat her, the two find an understanding and affection for one another that is both poetic and moving.As we continue to live in a world that is dominated by the Pixar-3D mediums, that are only told in our native language, general audiences and industry people need to branch out their scope in the genre and discover these little diamonds that are found in the nooks and crannies of the movie world. Lambert Wilson voices the gentle bear Ernest, who you might remember from The Matrix Reloaded as The Merovingian or more recently from Of Gods and Men where he played the lead Christian. He plays particularly well off his co-star Pauline Brunner, who's innocent ticks and beats in her voice, shine brightly through the naïve and sweet Celestine.The animation is simply stunning, reminiscing a storybook you would read to your youngest love, everything flows magically from page to screen, and inevitably into your heart. Directors Stéphane Aubier, Vincent Patar, and Benjamin Renner know, with great confidence, what kind of story they want to be told. Inserting the humor at the appropriate times before hitting the right emotional chords with the viewer by film's end. A tender yet bombastic composition by musical composer Vincent Courtois is the film's secret weapon. Capturing the moment and executing the ambiance with absolute precision. I was completely smitten with everything about Ernest & Celestine.By any means possible, seek out this French animated film from GKIDS. A sensational welcome to the animated genre that will be cherished for years. Ernest & Celestine is proof that hand-drawn animation should and still lives well in the medium. Its clever and fresh nature is purely magnetic and is something that should be considered for the Academy Awards.The film is scheduled for a limited release December 6."
3,Ernest & Celestine,8,22 November 2013,A sweet and touching independent animated film,"I first heard of this film when I was looking up rare animated films right here on IMDb (e.g. 'The Illusionist,' 'My Dog Tulip' and 'The Plague Dogs') and thought the original poster of the titular characters looked sweet so I was pleased when I found that I could watch it instantly online. When I finished watching it, I found it touching yet adorable despite the story having some predictable moments.The animation style is similar to that of 'My Dog Tulip' (i.e. jerky and flickery in places but still having subtle colours) albeit with characters that are not as sketchy, are well-shaded, have a more detailed watercolour look and are more neatly drawn - likewise with the backgrounds. While the incidental music is rarely used, it has an authentic old-fashioned feel and I liked how parts of Celestine's blue outline winter painting appeared in time with the music. I found the use of subtitles helpful since the dialogue is in French and found some snippets of it hard to decipher but I picked up a few words that I'd remembered from studying the language at school. This film reminded me of other films and TV shows I'd seen such as the original 1990s Madeline series (Celestine's orphanage) 'The BFG (again Celestine's orphanage being reminiscent of Sophie's and Celestine begging Ernest not to eat her being similar to Sophie doing the same to the BFG),' 'Flushed Away' (the underground mouse village) and 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' (the young mice going to the sweet shop after school). I found certain parts of the story predictable such as the rain washing the camouflage paint design off the van, thus leaving a trail of paint for the police to follow when it rolls backwards, and Ernest falling down the cellar during his unicycle juggling trick. I still found the latter predictable part funny as well as Ernest's 'one bear band' songs earlier in the film. There was even a twist on a cliché with a female bear being afraid of Celestine rather than a human woman or an elephant being scared of her and there were some cleverly executed ideas such as Celestine attending the bears' court and Ernest attending the mice court and the fire in the mice court spreading towards the bears' court. I was especially touched when Ernest and Celestine said they wanted to be with each other forever and I liked the happier version of their story at the end. While Celestine is a talented artist who is mostly sweet-natured and innocent throughout, I liked it when Ernest became more caring towards her despite his unfriendly and selfish attitude in the first half.All in all 'Ernest and Celestine' is yet another rare, independent animated film that was worth the watch and I would love to continue my search for films like this one. 8/10."
4,Ernest & Celestine,9,18 March 2014,The French are so good at animation.,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. I went into the film thinking it was more for adults, but discovered it has a story that anyone and any age can enjoy, and that's always a sign of a great movie.The movie is based on a children's book that I never herd of in which a Bear who's down on his luck befriends a mouse who's an artist at heart, beating all odds in a world where these two species are separated by fear and miscommunication.I love the animation style which I'm guessing is greatly inspired by the children's book it's based on. I especially loved the design of the mouse, Celestine. Her animation was very cute and they did a good job of making her very mouse-like with her movement and attitude while still making her relatable to humans. This was added by the voice over talent by Mackenzie Foy.I opted to watch the English dubbed version as I feel the authenticity of the dub matters less with animation. Some of you might disagree and I'm sure Lambert Wilson was great as Ernest, but hearing Forest Whitaker bring the poor reclusive bear whom Celestine befriends to life was a highlight.If you need a movie to take your kids to see, you gotta pick this one. It's a film that will put a smile on all of your faces."
5,Ernest & Celestine,10,25 February 2014,Very beautiful movie,"In a time when most of the movies aimed at kids seemed to be shallow and noisy CGI spectacles with annoying characters and sometimes questionable morals, is a relief having the chance to see a film just as charming and honest like this one.Besides of its beautiful animation (Which shows some slight resemblance with the Studio Ghibli films, particularly ""My Neighbors the Yamadas"") ""Ernest & Celestine"" is one of the most heartwarming stories about an odd friendship that I have seen in the recent years, being cute and endearing without turning corny or emotionally manipulative.It is definitely a work worth of admiration, which shows that kid's movies doesn't have to be condescending as many people seems to believe. Some kid's movies (like this one) are perfectly able to capture the heart of any viewer, disregard of their age.On an unrelated note, I don't know why this movie was rated ""PG"" since it didn't have any kind of objectionable content. The supposedly ""scary"" moments were no worse than the ""scary"" moments from ""The Princess and the Frog""(Which was rated G) Then again, I think ""Frozen"" should have been rated G too (Since its ""action"" and ""mild rude humor"" were on par with the Disney Renaissance classics as ""The Little Mermaid"" or ""Beauty & the Beast"", but for some reason almost all the recent family movies are rated PG.)"
6,Ernest & Celestine,8,16 February 2014,European Animation at its Finest,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating:3.8/5 starsSimplistic, sublime, superlative. Classic hand-drawn animation set against a picturesque Parisian background that is filled with an ambiance of great human divide and strong social references. At the heart of this wonderful tale is an endearing story of true friendship that withstands all odds to not only emerge triumphant but also infuse others around them and even the cynics who watch the film to have a change of heart. This soaring tale of friendship also brings forth a profound social commentary told with subtle metaphorical actions, which resonate brilliantly with our own state of human affairs."
7,Ernest & Celestine,10,21 May 2014,Looking for a quiet alternative to the CGI Hollywood movies? Ernest and Celestine is a sweet and gentle story about friendship.,"It's interesting how studios and creative people would assume they know what people want. Disney knows that people want to see fairy tale stories and grand animation making the way for memorable characters and catchy songs. Warner Brothers knows that people want to see really fast animation alongside some good visual gags as perpetrated by unique charters with a lot of heart. Most other studios seem to copy either formula in their own projects. It's not too bad of an idea as long they can make their movies just as original and unique (projects like Despicable Me or Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs).But I'm surprised with how these two formulas are the only ones that studios want to take a chance on. I've already talked about how I miss traditional hand drawn animation in movies today. You could say that children don't watch those kinds of movies anymore. But I ask of you ""Why are classics like Snow White, The Looney Toons and Popeye still being watched by modern kids?"". It's because they too has great legacies of good characters and memorable situations. There is always room for other options in animation that want something different. That would be one of this years Oscar nominated movies, Ernest and Celestine.In a lot of ways, this is nothing like modern Disney, Pixar, or the other big names. This tells a simpler story about friendship; a bear and a mouse. So in a world where mice live underground while bears walk and talk, living how we would, both sides agree that each species is evil and shouldn't we interacted with. At an orphanage, a young mouse Celestine is more curious about why the mice and rats are afraid of bears. She has a job of collecting bear teeth so that mice dentists can file them down for their fellow rodents to wear.She gets stuck in a garbage can where she is discovered by a starving musician bear, Ernest (played by Forest Whitaker). His first instinct is to eat Celestine, but she quickly scolds him for wanting to do so, confusing him. They make a deal to help each other, but the plan goes amiss and the two hide from the law in Ernest's home in the woods. Most of time is shown them interacting with each other and their skills; Celestine with her obsession with nature and art and Ernest and his spark for music and clowning.As I've said, this is a different offering from most of the other animated movies out. Ernest and Celestine is a much quieter movie about friendship. Though there's the principle tone about prejudice, the situation is simple at best. There's no villain or threatening force looking to destroy them. It's just this bear and mouse interacting and becoming friends. And you know what? That's all you really need with this kind of story. This is a very sweet and likable story that benefits from some really nice animation and two leads that both kids and adults would really like.Celestine may just be a young girl whose no higher then a few inches, but she still manages to be very spunky without being too annoying. It's her curiosity that rubs onto me that makes me want to learn about this world more. Ernest is a grouchy loner, but has plenty of heart that allows himself to absorb a lot of new ideas from this little mouse. The movie looks like one large watercolor painting, really letting the art taking control of the design and story. It looks beautiful. It feels more like something I would get from Winnie the Pooh; is simple but it works really well.I'll give this ten watercolor kits out of ten. Ernest and Celestine isn't exactly the most original story around, but it wins my heart with a very unique look and a gentle tone that anyone can enjoy. It's good old fashioned story telling at it's best. This is an absolute must with families."
8,Ernest & Celestine,,23 December 2013,water colors,"a splendid link between use of water colors and the story. a delicate manner to use a book adaptation for remind, in a precise, gentle, lovely style importance of relationship. a film who must see it not only for its message but for the fascinating art to resurrect the childhood flavor in old fashion manner. a movie about friendship , meeting between humor and drama, a form of fable and a lesson about image of the other. a small gem because the voices, the images, the story are not more important/beautiful/realistic but only part of an unique state of soul. an isle in middle of 3D waves, it is honest and warm and nice. but, more important, it is a kind of travel out of reality pressure as a reading fairy stories book in evening. in fact, a remember about small details who defines humanity."
9,Ernest & Celestine,9,3 February 2014,A true friendship can break all the barriers.,"An Oscar nominee in the category of best animation feature. The cutest animation which gave the experience of seeing a Japanese anime similar to from the Ghibli studio. The characters are very adorable, especially both the Ernest and Celestine. After praising the technicians I mean the illustrator I must compliment the voice renders. Whenever I hear Celestine saying 'Ernest, Ernest' I just fall in love because it was sexy. I know French language itself a seductive.No age group limited to enjoy this animation. From 6 year-old kid to 60 year-old and beyond that can have a great time with it. A simple animation with a good message story. Probably you will come to know what kinda movie is this if you have seen 'Stormy Night' and 'Ratatouille'. A tale about the unlikely friendship between two different living creatures.It all begins with a young little mouse who got a different opinion on the creatures that live above their world. The earth's surface was ruled by the big bad bears and that is what beneather believe. Between these two world a new friendship bloom from nowhere. But both the societies denies it so the two must protect each other and run for their life. Instead, they need to prove it can be possible and harmless. So they have to take the advantage of the such circumstances and how it can be done is the rest.The character Ernest was lazy, but tough and Celestine is very active, but sensitive in matters. The friendship between them was very well told, in an enchanting way. I liked the replacement of bear in the place of humans. Otherwise, our people think they are genius to find similarity between this and 'Ratatouille'.Earlier I was very, very disappointed for ditching 'Monsters University' over crap movie 'Despicable Me 2'. I will be so happy if 'The Wind Rises' or this movie wins the Oscar. But Americas own 'Frozen' will be a strong contender for the honour.Finally, I retire for now by saying it is a must see movie, especially if you are an animation movie fan. I truly wanted it not to end, in the world at certain point everything must end and so it is against my will."
10,Ernest & Celestine,7,5 February 2014,Traditional animation with charming story,"Ernest And Celestine is a fantastic story that presents us a friendship that shouldn't happen, but against all odds prevails. Celestine is a young mouse that is curious about the world above and has a knack for art. Unfortunately for her, the mice around her wish to see her become a dentist as it is more her position in society. Almost alike, above the sewage an oaf like bear named Ernest longs to become a performer, but upon his family's wishes to become a judge, he ultimately ends up living in poor conditions and with his aspirations frowned upon. When they meet they will shake the foundations of the place they live in. This tale is classic storytelling and features interesting characters to root for. This friendship seems very real because the personalities involved are genuinely kind and don't agree with the way life is lived. The animation is very simple yet beautiful. Against more grand animation works, Ernest And Celestine still stands out with its endearing story and overall is a pleasure to watch.Rating: 7,5/10"
11,Ernest & Celestine,10,12 October 2013,"A bear and a mouse fall in love, despite everyone around telling them it is impossible","A beautifully drawn and told story for children, with a pretty deep message for adults. Almost everything about it is near perfection and probably its only true imperfection is that it is too close to perfection. Up and down, individual and gregarious, social and spiritual, almost all the fundamental symbols of humanity are so nicely put together into the cutest story ever that you might feel it's too simple. It is in the end, after all, just a children story and for some of the people watching it the message will maybe not go through. It's like saying to someone that the secret to happiness is to think positive. They'll dismiss it as a total nonsense. That's how I came to the conclusion this movie is a straight 10 - the secret to a good movie is almost childlike simplicity and sincerity."
12,Ernest & Celestine,9,30 June 2014,No Joke this is one of the greatest animated films of all time.,"What happens when you mixes unique water color visuals, a coherent plot, good voice acting both in English dub and in the original French, and have a an entertaining story representing powerful themes. Ladies and gentlemen I present to you Ernest & Celestine. Original title (Ernest et Célestine)Before I begin I would like to note that I did a lot of things just to find out there was a DVD release.Sorry to keep you waiting let's begin.The best place to start this review is the story. The story line of the film is that a mouse and a bear become friends in a society where mice live underground and despise bears, and bear live above ground and treat mice like humans do. Okay, I know that the story sounds pretty silly. But it's not. In fact it very well done. The way they represent that hatred and fear between mice and bears is funny, serious, and the prejudice is tamed enough for children to watch. The key word is enough. This film is not afraid to hold back on a few parts. Besides I'm an American. Where I come from we have tons of sillier, and worse sounding film plots that usually get terrible reviews in the end. The way that Ernest the bear and Celestine the mouse meet and become friends in the end shows us the world they live in and is also very understandable keeping up with the films continuity. The ending itself is very unique and respectful. The film Ernest and Celestine is based on a book with the same title made by Belgian author Gabrielle Vincent. The ending isn't anticlimactic or anything, but it does beg the question of why the film makers couldn't continue afterwards. It's because they wanted to respect the now dead author's way of making the books.Visually this film looks not shorter than the word outstanding. I believe this is the first 2D animated film to be done in water color, and a bit of Computer animation. Ernest & Celestine's graphics are beautifully well painted. This is one of the few films in history where you can pause the film any time and it will look like a portrait. Anybody who has a DVD like I do can take pictures of the film in HD and make our own portraits of them. However there's one thing that can be criticized. The visuals are not always used that to their maximum potential. What I mean by that is that there are not a few scenes in the film where the visuals are used to open the world were looking at on screen with ease. That may sound like an opinion but if you watch the film you'll see. I should note that if you want to enjoy this film looks to the fullest, I recommended that you by the DVD. If you plan on watching this online and can't find it in High Definition then some of the visuals in the film will come off blurry. Depending on how much you like the film clearly will help you decide if you want to but the DVD.Lastly the Voice acting is supremely good. I know by now some people might think I'm just over praising this film now, but really these voice overs are amazing. Gkids the translators deserve a big applause for translating this into English voices. Every voice in the film fits perfectly.Overall Ernest & Celestine is a delight. I'm happy to say waiting for this film was worth it. It's also nice to revisit this film. The best way to describe its re-watch ability is like this. You're being told a story at night time. The characters are your milk, and the visuals are you cookies. By Facts this film deserves a score of 9.5. The majority of people who will watch the film will definitely like it and come back for more. The score for the majority is an 8.7. And here are the other scores. Animation 9.6/10, Story 9.5/10, Characters 10/10, and Pacing 9/10."
13,Ernest & Celestine,10,24 June 2014,A remarkable movie,"I saw this movie last month up in Cleveland, in a movie theater. I very much liked it, with one reservation: I felt that Forest Whittaker's voice was wrong for Ernest, the bear.Now that it's out on DVD and I've had a chance to watch it in the original French, I can see that the voice does, in fact, make a big difference. The French actor who voices Ernest, Lambert Wilson, does not sound at all like Forest Whittaker, and it makes Ernest come off as less gruff. He explains, in his segment of the ""Making of"" film that is included on the DVD, and which I very highly recommend, that he made a conscious choice not to sound like a ""Disney bear"" because that was not in accord with Ernest's character and the style of the art. It really does make a big difference. You might try watching at least part of it once in French with English subtitles, to see.The story of this movie is nice, and the last scene is a lot better than just nice, as the halls of an unjust and inhumane justice come tumbling down, and Ernest and Celestine are able to escape the racist prejudices of their respective societies.But the real beauty of this movie is the art. The watercolor style is very original, and at times has a real poetry, especially when Ernest and Celestine pass the winter in his cabin and make art, he music and she drawing.Here, again, you can increase your appreciation of the movie by watching the ""Making of"" film that accompanies it on the DVD. The movie is based on a series of illustrated children's books by a French author-illustrator who had passed away before the movie was made. You get to see the extent to which they tried to reproduce her watercolor style, but also the things that they added that were new. Two of those things that, of necessity, had to be entirely new, and that play a big role in how you perceive the story, are the way the characters move and the music provided. If you stop to think about it, you never see Winnie the Pooh, or Charlie Brown, or any of the great British or American animated characters move in the children's books and comics that have been turned into successful movies or TV programs. Coming up with a way of having them walk, stretch, etc., that is in keeping with how we already imagine their character is not easy. But the animators have solved that problem perfectly in this movie.The background music is also very important here. Just as the jazzy music in the Peanuts TV programs played a major role in characterizing the characters, so the music here, very original, develops these characters and this story without overwhelming it. Another complete success.I don't know what a small child would get out of all this. Some parts are funny, but I don't know if there's enough action to hold small children. For ""children of all ages,"" however, there is a very beautiful and original movie that is not to be missed."
14,Ernest & Celestine,8,19 April 2014,Simply Adorable!,"Move over Pixar and Disney, your monopoly be damned. Although I do like some of the Pixar/Dinsey animated movies, it was always the French animated movies that I adored. It was always amusing and entertaining and often adhering to real life nuances than go all aboard with fantasy. From L'illusioniste to Persepolis, the craftsmanship and quality that goes into these movies are impeccable. Often manually animated than using CG, the smooth animation is just mesmerizing, furthermore the narrative and the characters rivets you to your seats. Although these movies might not garner as much attention as an over-rated Hollywood production, they've always been highly refined, immensely engrossing.Based on the kids' book by Belgian author and illustrator Gabrielle Vincent, Ernest et Célestine is the sweet sweet story of Célestine an orphan mouse who befriends a poor Bear, Ernest. In a society where the two factions are prohibited The story isn't something to write home about but it has all the essential elements to entertain you till end. I saw the French version and it seems like there is also an English dubbed version voiced over by some AAA actors like Forest Whitaker, Paul Giamatti, William H. Macy. The movie is warmly visual and wouldn't be an issue for the young ones to get hold of whats happening on screen.Its simplicity is what made me love it so much. You are drawn into the spellbinding art and animation and its almost like a water-colored fairytale book come to life in front of you. It works a bit like a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip sans the philosophical quandaries. Instead Ernest et Célestine digs subtly into the political and societal undertones. Having seen both Frozen and Ernest et Célestine, I couldn't even fathom why Frozen won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.In an industry where even animated movies are filled with shades of debauchery, you'd be a victim of a slew of questions from your young ones that you'd be too embarrassed to answer. Thankfully, Ernest et Célestine is a movie so innocent and pure at heart, that it can be watched with kids of all ages. Let them soak in the brilliant and colorful art direction and Ernest et Célestine's beautiful friendship. There's a lot that could be learnt from these two adorable critters."
15,Ernest & Celestine,10,29 March 2014,One of my favorite animated features ever!,"As a person who works in animation, I don't tend to watch a lot of animation. I actually have hardly seen the features I worked on. I watched bits and pieces during the production but usually by the time they came out, I was on the next project and to be honest I couldn't bother. I worked on 6 feature productions(not mentioning the countless TV productions) of which 3 were among the most expensive Hollywood productions and 3 were European, so I worked on productions of both ""worlds"". None had the sincerity and appeal Ernest and Célestine has to me. I totally missed this one while it was in production and was released(I know, it's pathetic) and only noticed it because it was nominated at the Oscars. I immediately watched video clips and thought WOW. Great art, great animation, appealing characters and the overall look was completely stunning. I knew the French are great when it comes to animation because they were among the best animators on all the Hollywood productions I worked for. I immediately bought the DVD and was blown away. It's so sincere and endearing that it's refreshing to see this among all the generic stuff that got me tired of watching animation. Being a person who works in the industry it sounds absurd. I completely lost faith that animation still can be good after years of formula productions. I do like Miyasaki but I have to admit, I was never the super fan. It became even more apparent when I tried to watch Ponyo straight after watching this movie. What I like about Ernest & Célestine is that I keep on watching small bits of it because I just love watching the details, the animation, the situations and everything. It's small things like when Ernest discovers Célestine in the garbage can and first kicks the can to wake her up, then pokes her, her reaction, then it goes on when Ernest tries to eat Célestine, her reaction to that and finally the starving Ernest ending up in the candy store with the scene turning into hilarious slapstick. The whole scene is pure brilliance just like the rest of the movie. It doesn't get any better than this or at least it will be hard to top. This is a must see if you really love animation.This makes me hopeful that there might be more good stuff to come but until then this will be one of my all time favorite animation features ever."
16,Ernest & Celestine,,9 February 2014,A Wonderful Tale of Friendship For All Ages.,"A visual & emotional delight from start to finish, Ernest & Célestine is an immensely sweet yet simple tale of a young mouse named Célestine who develops an unlikely friendship with a bear named Ernest. It presents a world where bears live above the ground while the underground belongs to rodents. Célestine is pursuing a dental career even though he has no interest in it & spends most of his time sketching or painting. Ernest on the other hand is a poor bear who is starving in the cold but is unable to find any food or money. A twist of fate brings the two together when Célestine helps Ernest find food & Ernest returns the favour by fulfilling Célestine's wish & an unlikely bond is formed between the two which only gets stronger as the film progresses.The story is surprisingly good here & is brilliantly envisioned for the screen. The script retains an adorable cuteness & the way it's been crafted gives an appearance of a wonderful artist painting a beautiful picture with water colours. Running at only 80 minutes, the film still manages to retain a relaxed pace in narrating its story & the animation is aesthetically & artistically pleasing. On an overall scale, Ernest & Célestine is a refreshing & heartwarming take on friendship that'll appeal to both kids & grown ups and is a quiet yet fresh addition to its genre which unfortunately didn't have a very fruitful year. Easily one of the best animation films of 2013, this sweet, cute & unexpectedly touching cinema is delightfully recommended."
17,Ernest & Celestine,9,25 March 2014,Totally adorable.,"Apparently, there is more than one version of this film available--the original French as well as a new English language dub. I saw the French version with subtitles, so keep this in mind.In this odd little world, the bears live in cities--just like people. But the only other creature in this odd world are the mice--and they live under the city. The two species avoid each other and the mice are convinced that the bears are all evil. However, one young mouse, Celestine, is convinced that these stories adults tell young mice about the bears are just stories and she's interested in the world above. I'm not going to go into all the details how, but Celestine eventually meets Ernest the bear. Ernest actually IS ready to eat Celestine but doesn't and they eventually become friends. However, in the process of stealing some teeth (it's a long story--just see this portion of the film yourself), they become wanted by both the mouse and bear police--and for upsetting the way society runs. What's to happen next? See the film.The best thing this film has going for it is that it's sweet and quite adorable. Additionally, the animation is really interesting and unique. While ""Frozen"" won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, ""Ernest & Celestine"" was also nominated. While most probably wouldn't agree, I think this French film should have won because it was much more innovative and entertaining. A film that's hard to hate...I sure hope we see more from the folks who made this fine movie."
18,Ernest & Celestine,,8 June 2013,A children's film with social messages,"This film is about a mouse who likes bears, the natural enemy of mice. She befriends a bear and begins an adventure between both worlds.""Ernest & Celestine"" tells a story of forbidden bonding between bears and mice. Mice are taught to fear bears since young, but Celestine is undeterred from her fantasy towards bears. Her unrelenting curiosity, quick wit and her artistic ability provides a passport to her adventures above ground, where she does not belong. The segregation of worlds mirror social segregation in real life; while the forbidden friendship and the subsequent persecution mirror persecution of people pursuing forbidden love in real life.The visuals are very simple; there is only fairy book like, plain animations where the background is reduced to an impressionistic sketch. The plot is squeaky clean, and there is little to upset children. Despite the messages of social problems hidden behind the plot, ""Ernest & Celestine"" is still a film for young children."
19,Ernest & Celestine,8,25 September 2015,Sweet and simple story and animation,"This is a true family animation film, as it has a sweet story, but one that can be enjoyed by adults, a simple animation that doesn't go into weird and complex techniques that confuse the eye but instead focuses on context and characters and a benign kind of plot. That is perhaps because it is based on a series of children's books of the same name published by the Belgian author Gabrielle Vincent.The story is that of two societies that are content to live separately and leave each other alone: bears and mice. However a young mouse is intrigued by the world of bears and befriends one other outcast: Ernest the penniless street artist, while both cultures are trying to punish the transgression.It is not a perfect film. The character of Ernest, while lovable some of the time, it is mostly annoying. Celestine herself is poorly defined as a character, as well. But the flow of the story is smooth and the film fun. I recommend it, especially if you have small children."
20,Ernest & Celestine,8,21 March 2015,Cozy little tale of unlikely friendship,"A charming and heartwarming tale about the unlikely friendship between a bear and a mouse in a world divided by convention, tradition, assumptions and prejudice into two territories - the bears above ground and the mice underground. Painted in bright and cheerful watercolours, the audience followed the pair of ""bandits"" in their adventures and encountered the self-righteous, the hypocritical, the mercenary and the conforming members of both races on the way amidst laughter. The portrayal of Céléstine was most adorable as a dreamy coquettish schoolgirl and her attachment to Ernest the street musician was touching. The French are good at engineering happily-ever-after endings minus the dowdy feelings which were made possible by the kind nature of both protagonists and this movie is suitable even for children (unlike most modern remakes of fairy tales). One more note, it is amusing watching two equally biased and opinionated societies blackmouthing each other without realizing their similarities."
21,Ernest & Celestine,10,9 September 2014,"Marvelous film, beautifully done hand-drawn animation","This film was nominated for the Oscar for Animated Feature. There will be spoilers ahead:This is a beautiful film about a most unlikely friendship between a mouse and a bear. Mice are taught to fear and hate bears and bears are similarly taught to do the same with mice. But Ernest is not a typical bear and Celestine is no ordinary mouse. Both are a bit out of step with their own world, but remarkably good as a pair when they come together. They complement one another and they are both artists.Ernest is basically a very large and furry kid at heart, given to very simple reactions to pretty much everything, unless he's playing music-and even there, he has a playful side, as shown by his busking early in the film. He inadvertently helps Celestine out of a jam, has designs on eating her, but she points him towards candy, a much better treat than one tiny mouse.Ernest, in turn, winds up in trouble, to have Celestine help him out. One thing leads to another and they both wind up in deep trouble and hiding out at Ernest's house, where they develop a bond together.Everything is wrapped up in a most intense closing series of scenes which teach tolerance, the true value of courage and the strengths of friendship. It's a truly heartwarming film.This is available on Blu-Ray and DVD and is well worth watching. Most highly recommended."
22,Ernest & Celestine,9,27 August 2014,Beautiful!,"One of the best examples of how good animated features out of United States can be. This movie can make you think twice about if a movie for kids can't teach anything to the grown-ups. No matter your age, you'll be wishing to know what's going on since the first scene.The beautiful animation takes you deep into the almost flawless plot and the very well done voice acting. This film shows the kids (and everyone else) the important value of friendship in a most beautiful way."
23,Ernest & Celestine,10,13 July 2014,"Despite living in separate worlds, in which one world fears the inhabitants of another, a mouse and a bear find themselves developing an almost parent/ child friendship.","This was an academy award nominee amongst The Wind Rises, and the overrated Frozen, and unfortunately wasn't available to me around the time of the ceremony. But after watching it, I'm starting to think perhaps I should have a stronger interest in French cinema. For in the movies I've seen thus far from the country, they all have a beautiful complexity, even when a horror film like Martyrs, which perhaps solely comes from being too accustomed to America cinema. Leading to the question: despite an Oscar nomination, is it worth seeing this film?Characters & StoryIn a world segregated between bears and mice, bears living on the surface and mice in the sewers, prejudice is rampant between the two. Mice children are taught bears are ferocious and deadly, while bears see mice as humans do: uninvited greedy little guests. But, despite all this, mice need bears for their teeth are good replacements for theirs. As for bears, well they don't really get anything out of this deal.But teeth are what lead to the main plot of the story as one young artistic orphan named Celestine (Pauline Brunner) finds herself befriending a poor musician named Ernest (Lamber Wilson). And what starts with him trying to eat her turns into them looking out for each other, loving each other, and finding each other to fit their needs. Celestine gives Ernest the love and encouragement he needs, and Celestine receives the sense of family and a home in return. Making their crime filled journey to their own personal bliss quite the tale.PraiseOh where to begin? There is the art style, story, the characters, and the fact it packs such a well-developed story in only a little over an hour. But perhaps what should be highlighted the most is that as cute as the story is between this Celestine and Ernest, it also creates a good learning tool for talking about prejudice with kids, as well as why people in poverty steal, why people panhandle and beg, and the importance of social services. For in the movie, often times there are examples of how prejudice is learned as shown by the stories of how dangerous bears are, and how everyone is pushed to conform into prejudice beliefs over their own perceptions.Which makes Celestine interacting with Ernest a good tool for teaching kids to question what others whisper and say about others. For, using examples from the movie, Celestine was warned her whole life about bears, and yet Ernest became perhaps one of the nicest animals she has ever met. Then, during later scenes, it shows examples of negative peer pressure and how simply following along, and not speaking out, could lead to someone being judged unjustly for something they did, or did not, do. Making, overall, what looks like a simple kid film greatly complex.CriticismHonestly, the only thing worth critiquing is after the ""crime spree"" of Celestine and Ernest, I was confused how come the ever fearful mice were able to take a bear Ernest's size into custody. Outside of that little issue though, you'd be hard pressed to find something wrong with this.Overall: Worth SeeingComplex animated films, which are kid friendly, are sort of rare. So when films like this come out and can either be seen as simple cute films, or learning tools, they certainly deserve praise. And that is why I'm labeling this as ""Worth Seeing."""
24,Ernest & Celestine,9,16 December 2017,A Children's Book that Just Happens to be Animated,"Ernest & Celestine is one of the cutest animated films I've ever seen. Considering that this was based off a series of children books, it doesn't even need to try to be cute; it's adorable to the core. The simplistic story of an orphaned mouse named Celestine who ends up befriending the down on his luck bear Ernest is odd at first, but there's so much genuine warmth in Celestine that it becomes charming and even emotional as the film progresses. Not to mention, they're both relatable in how much they love art, and even if they committed some crimes by accident, they just want to be with each other and display happiness and warmth through art and poetry. Yeah a bear and a mouse living together sounds odd, but if you think about it, it's not so different than an African-American and a Caucasian marrying each other, or gay marriage, or two people of a different religion being friends. It doesn't matter what they look like, what matters is that they're kind souls who just want to make what they love together. Along with gorgeous albeit simple animation, splendid voice acting, and a sweet melodious music score, Ernest & Celestine is an absolutely adorable and sweet film that children should definitely watch to not only get a touch to such charming characters, but to be reminded that it's ok to befriend someone who may seem different as long as they're passionate and well rounded albeit imperfect individuals. You'll have plenty of stories to tell, not unlike Ernest & Celestine."
25,Ernest & Celestine,10,10 August 2017,Loved this cartoon,It was so refreshing to see a classically animated film today with such a great story. I instantly fell in love with the characters. Lots of hidden meaning and lessons to be learned. Can't wait for a sequel. I really think that this film will be enjoyed both by children and children at heart.
26,Ernest & Celestine,9,28 March 2017,An underrated piece of art.,"Ernest & Celestine is one of the best animated films I've seen in the past five years. It's art style and character work is absolutely beautiful and charming, and nearly everything it sets to achieve is achieved. This is the classic story of two clashing worlds coming together, but done in a way that is not cheesy; the film doesn't end with the Bears who live above and the Mice who live below coming together and singing ""Kumbayah"" and everything is hunky-dory, but done in a very realistic, nice way. The first thing I need to say is that this film is very similar to the story and themes of Zootopia, but done in a much quieter, nuanced way, with no punchy pop song to pull tween crowd. The story focuses on Celestine, a little mouse who doesn't believe in her society's mantra that bears are terrible creatures to be feared, and instead has a cautious belief that the can be friends, and Ernest, a poor musician bear who is always in the search of a meal, and is generally a little selfish. Over the course of the film, we see the two begin to work together, but not in the way that films like this usually handle this. We see Celestine already possessing a friendly sympathetic respect for Ernest, while Ernest, though not mean-spirited, only helps Celestine out of convenience, more than compassion (that comes later). The movie really knows how to draw comparisons between it's world's view of prejudice and the real world's view of prejudice without screaming ""HA! SEE WHAT WE DID THERE!"", and instead flows very naturally. In terms of technical elements, the music of this film is beautiful, and compliments the water colored artwork and lower frame-storybook animation style supremely well, and it's physical slapstick and comedic dialogue carry it well, and the American voice dubbing is fantastic; Forest Whitaker as Ernest is simply brilliant in this film. My biggest gripe with the movie is its ending scene, where the two societies both bring Ernest and Celestine to court to hold them accountable for the ""crimes"" (Ernest in the mouse world, Celestine in the bear world). Instead of having the people who doubted or were negatively impacted by Celestine and Ernest, such as the Mouse Dentist or the Bear Family be the ones that see the error in their ways, it's simply the judges of the courts, who had not been introduced to the movie before then, to be the ones to realize this, so the impact is less. Even then, it's still handled so well. The two societies don't come together after this (at least, if they are, it's not shown), but they simply let Ernest and Celestine to go off and live together how they'd like to. They don't change the world globally through their actions, they only change it for themselves, which is something I wish a lot more films would do when talking about these types of subjects. Because of these things, this film is a work of art. I would highly recommend this film for young children, as I think it could easily become a modern animated classic, and it's a shame this film isn't more well known. I just watched this film, and I already want to watch it again. 9.0/10"
27,Ernest & Celestine,7,17 January 2017,Delightful,"Ernest an Celestine feels like an old Beatrix Potter's book brought forward in time. The story is actually based on a series of children books by Gabrielle Vincent, a Belgian author and illustrator.This is a story about an impossible friendship and partnership between a male lonely street musician bear and a dentist apprentice female mouse who just wants to be a painter. The two live in the same city but in different worlds that don't mingle and despise each other, but are essentially a version of each other. Ernest and Celestine, despite their origin, have an immediate connection because they are practical common sense people, artists with a sensitive nature and a view of the world that don't easily accept absurd societal norms.The story is very simple, with a great message and mix of heart, fun and cuteness, perfect for small children, still enjoyable by adults. It is well narrated, very entertaining and visually wonderful. The hand-drawn animation in pastel colors is absolutely gorgeous, especially beautiful regarding the backgrounds and interior design. Celestine's character is uber-cute. There is not much to tell about this movie, it is heart-warming, has a good message of acceptance of different people, teaches you not to judge a book by its cover, and speaks of how wonderful is having a good friend.The film is 90 minutes long, but it feels shorter.I watched this movie dubbed by the Americans, and I found all the cast stupendous. You know the cast of an animated is good when you don't recognize their natural voices. Forest Whitaker is excellent and unrecognizable as Ernest, Mackenzie Foy is delightful as Celestine, Giametti makes the rat judge really despicable, and Jeffrey Wright has a wonderful judging calm voice as the Grizzly Judge. Lauren Bacall is great as the Great One. All great assets for this delightful movie."
28,Ernest & Celestine,6,17 August 2016,Beautifully animated standard kids movie,"Ernest and Celestine is beautiful to look at, but failed to impress me in any other field. Ernest and Celestine is the creation of french directors Stéphane Aubier, Vincent Patar, and Benjamin Renner. The first two are also the directors of one of my favorites, A Town Called Panic. A Town Called Panic is a great movie, which I can't say the same for about Ernest and Celestine.Ernest and Celestine looks great. Each frame looks like a children's drawing. Lots of character is communicated through the animation of characters. Every character also feels real by almost every movement having an effect on the environment, such as sound effects, a responding character, or the environment. The biggest reason Ernest and Celestine doesn't work as well is it takes itself much more seriously. This could be good or bad, but the movie has parts that are hard to describe other than dumb. Can't really describe any without spoiling, but one example is a series of conveniences towards the end to bring the movie to a happy conclusion. Many such conveniences are in A Town Called Panic, but since it doesn't take itself seriously you can laugh at the stupid parts rather than be bothered by them. The movie tackles the subject of prejudice, but it does so in a black and white way. Where all of the prejudiced characters have no reasons, real or imagined, to separate one another. I found the predictability of how it would develop disappointing, because A Town Called Panic always surprised me.All that said, none of my complaints are anything that should stop you from showing your kid this movie. The voice acting is good, and the characters likable. I thought Ernest and Celestine was very good with issues that stop me from calling it great. I would recommend Ernest and Celestine to adults and children alike, but I most likely won't revisit it soon."
29,Ernest & Celestine,,17 July 2016,admirable   work,"a unusual friendship. two worlds lovely music. and beautiful colors. and, sure, touching story. it is not real easy to define this web of adventure and delicate emotions, runs, secrets, tension and trips in well known universes, from other animations, but different by each preliminary supposition. a film about beauty of life, it is one of good reminds of classic animation and inspired entertainment for entire family. a film of small things who gives sense. about importance of innocence as instrument to discover the essence of existence. and nice homage to the friendship. all as forms of revelations about heart of every new day. one of useful animations. for its grace, beauty and realism . adorable remind of old fables. and eulogy for the discover of yourself in the other."
30,Ernest & Celestine,,11 March 2014,Very original and cliché at the same time. I love it.,"So the first thing that strikes out about Ernest and Célestine is its special style of animation. Basically the whole movie is a watercolor based painting, making the scenery and characters look very soft. So visually, I felt the movie was very original and pleasant to look at.The main characters Ernest and Celestine are two joyous creatures of a separate kind (Ernest is a bear, while Célestine is a mouse). It is clearly stated that these two kinds, are separate creatures that must not interact with each other in order to prevent conflict.Both of them start out going about their daily lives of trying to be different, while everyone just wants them to stay in line and be useful to ""society"".Eventually they meet and become friends.. and you pretty much can tell what happens after that.While we've heard this kind of story before, I feel that Ernest and Célestine brings enough originality to the table as to not suffer from the predictability of the story. Even though you know what is going to happen. The warm visuals and joyous characters are enough to grab you and keep your attention for the entire movie (which is only about 70 minutes or so).Go watch it. It's worth it. It will make you feel fuzzy and warm inside."
31,Ernest & Celestine,6,16 January 2014,Very Charming but the Message May Be Confusing,"I was encouraged to watch this animated film when it was named one of the nominees of the Oscar for Best Animated Feature for this year. I have been rewarded before by discovering small obscure gems like ""Secret of Kells."" This is one is another charming treat.Ernest is a bear. Celestine is a mouse. There live in two parallel worlds never meant to meet, where each is a nightmare to the other. However, when needs overtake reason, Celestine crosses over to the world above, meets Ernest and later conscripts him to help her with a big favor. Their caper entangles them with the law from both the world above and the world below, making them fugitives twice over.The pastel watercolor and pencil sketch artwork is definitely very charming and delightful. It is always refreshing to see other forms of animation aside from the mainstream noisy, high-energy Disney, Pixar, or Dreamworks fare.The only thing I did not really like about this supposedly children's film was that there is an angle that involves a criminal act. Crime should not pay, even if the perpetrators are cute. The message might confuse young children."
32,Ernest & Celestine,5,31 December 2016,Enjoyable but story and message are weird,"There's near-universal acclaim for this movie among critics and viewers, so mine is definitely a minority opinion. While I enjoyed the movie, the story just didn't make much sense to me or seem at all consistent. The various actions of the characters, their situation in life didn't make much sense to me. The dual tracks of the above/below ground worlds of bear/mouse society were odd.But what bothered me most about the film, especially as a film for children, was the relationship between the two main characters. It went beyond that of what we traditionally think of as close friends, who, while greatly enjoying each other's company, still want to be part of society and be with others. The relationship between Ernest & Celestine is much more that of lovers, happy if the entire world goes to hell so long as they can be together. Celestine is a ""her"" at one point of the film; whether Ernestine's gender is ever revealed I don't know. But the relationship seems to be that of of a big, strong, dumb male and a petite, weak, smart female...of different species.Probably 98% of readers will respond ""it's just a fairy tale,"" ""you're reading too much into it,"" ""yours is a narrow, conservative view of love"" etc. But for me, the movie sends a confusing message to children of friendship versus love, especially given the different species of the characters."
33,Ernest & Celestine,,5 July 2014,Solid,"This is definitely film for very young kids, but like most animated films, it can be enjoyed by all ages. That doesn't mean that it's actually really great for older people, because for me, I found it way too simplistic. Still, it's solid, and the original foreign language voice performances are really great. I wish I could see it with the new English dubbing and all of the actors that lend their voices, but as it is it seems like it isn't all that needed. The basic plot is pretty simple for kids but I could also see some kids getting restless, since this isn't an adventure animated film like so many are used to. Still, recommended."
34,Ernest & Celestine,7,17 June 2014,Cold hearts won't stand a chance against this warmth,"""A storybook come to life"" is the best way to put ERNEST AND CELESTINE, a delightful piece of animation candy about friendship and unlikely bonding. A bear and a mouse, both on opposite sides of societal convention, band together as misfits. And to see the two warm to each other is the emotional core of the movie - and really, Celestine (and Mackenzie Foy's performance) is about the sweetest damn thing imaginable.ERNEST AND CELESTINE doesn't run short on heart and magic, and the movie's all the better for it. Gotta hand it to the French to bring to life something this pure and whimsical.7/10"
35,Ernest & Celestine,6,5 February 2014,It is a good film for kids but I expect a lot more from an Oscar nominee!,"'ERNEST & CELESTINE': Three Stars (Out of Five) One of the Oscar nominated films for Best Animated Feature this year is this tale of a bear and a mouse who become friends (despite society trying to keep them apart, due to prejudices). It was directed by Stéphane Aubier, Vincent Patar and Benjamin Renner and written by Daniel Pennac (the English adaptation was written by Stephanie Sheh). The movie is a French-Belgian film that's based on a children's book series written and illustrated by Gabrielle Vincent (a Belgian writer). I think it's a good movie for kids (with a positive message about accepting others) but it's not worthy of any Oscar nominations.The film tells the story a mouse named Celestine (voiced by Pauline Brunner) and a bear named Ernest (Lambert Wilson). Celestine lives in an underground orphanage where she's constantly read horror stories about evil bears, by an orphanage guardian named La Grice (Anne-Marie Loop). Celestine doesn't believe the stories though and makes drawings of nice bears who befriend mice (which other rodents mock her for). All mice are raised to be dentists and one day Celestine is sent outside (to the bear world) to collect lost teeth from underneath bear cubs' pillows. On her adventure she meets Ernest, who is starving and at first wants to eat her. Celestine shows him a cellar full of candy instead and an odd friendship forms between the two. Others of course find their friendship frightening (to their way of life) though.The drawings are reminiscent of old classic animated films and cartoons and the movie does have somewhat of a nostalgic feel to it. Like I said the message of the film (about prejudices and biases) is a good one and the overall nature of it is very innocent and comforting. The story is very simplistic and predictable though and I found the movie to be really boring at times as well. It is a good film for kids but I expect a lot more from an Oscar nominee. I don't think animated movies like 'DESPICABLE ME 2' deserve their Oscar nominations either though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NdCvPRYk4"
36,Ernest & Celestine,8,26 January 2014,Water Color Animation with a solid story,"7.75 of 10. Unlike most films and cartoons this year, this one actually suffers from being too short. Despite drawing and animation that's sub-South Park quality, there are some impressively animated and realistic sequences involving everything from twitching noses to fire.I hope there's a non-subtitled version eventually. Enjoying a cartoon with subtitles is extremely difficult. Among other possible funding issues is the length and overly short plot development. The water color like drawing is also too sketchy/faded in places.Back to the story, it has multiple levels and shifts from being what seems like a simple child's tale with some cute characters to being a sophisticated allegory that adults can enjoy too."
37,Ernest & Celestine,7,5 March 2015,A visually invigorating film for people of all ages,"I just completed the HD version of Ernest and Celestine with English voice overs. I must say, it may just be the most visually appealing movie I have ever seen! The title characters are very lovable and the English voice actors did a great job. The plot holds up well, and unlike many movies aimed towards children, it has a great message.I recommend Ernest and Celestine as a movie for the whole family, because while kids will love it for the visuals, parents are likely enjoy the plot.Other than maybe a few proportioning issues with the objects within the film, there were very few problems. I give this one an 8/10, really good!"
