0,Alice,10,6 June 2003,Imagery that Bores Inside,"This movie may be labeled frustratingly plotless by some, and that's fair, but the imagery in this strange combination of stop-motion animation and live footage is so hauntingly rich and evocative that you get the feeling that someone has secretly filmed your own childhood dreams and translated them into Czech - perhaps for the viewing pleasure of the former commissars. The basic idea is that all of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is occurring in Alice's house, and a staggering variety of household items are animated into jerky sort of life, while all the character voices - Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts, White Rabbit - are spoken by Alice. Alice's house, however, is a Czech house, and the items are old even by Soviet bloc standards. It's as if an antique rummage sale suddenly sprang to life to act out a monstrous little comedy for one girl. And the architecture is simultaneously comforting and frightening. Windows, for example, merely open onto other rooms, all lit by bare light bulbs. What keeps the thing tied to Lewis Carroll is the performance of the little girl playing Alice. She appears to be about six or seven, and despite the disturbing events going on around her, she never appears frightened, and always investigates events as they grow curiouser and curiouser with a determined pluck. This little girl is always in control. What this adaptation lacks in forward momentum or narrative drive it makes up for with a surreal poetry of the domestic space as dreamed by a child."
1,Alice,8,13 August 2001,Watch your socks,"Watched this last night - one of my favorites, especially as and ex-art student. He animated everything from socks to lumps of meat. Very dark, and would have been darker yet without the little girls voice over. My favorite scene, I think, is when the water rat sets up camp on her head. There is a lot to watch out for in this film, a hundred little touches, and references. Follows the book to a certain extent, but goes its own lunatic-asylum way. If you have very vivid dreams and wake up in the morning wondering 'what the heck was that all about?', it is a bit like watching this film:)"
2,Alice,,22 August 1999,Visually stunning - and intense. Not for little kiddies!,"A mix of live action and stop-action, this arthouse flick is intriguing but bizarre.  But if I was a little kid I'd be scared out of my wits by The White Rabbit with bulging glass eyeballs & long, hamster-like fangs.  Socks become wood-eating worms, Alice starts eating marmalade full of tacks, a tiny mouse lands on her head, punctures it & starts a fire, the rabbit hole she falls down starts as a desk drawer that grabs her & draws her in.  The Alice doll she becomes when she's shrunk is sweet but sad.  I have to admit it's fascinating and 180 degrees from the saccharine sweetness of the Disney film.  See it on video to experience something completely different, and probably more towards the way Lewis Carroll intended the story to be..."
3,Alice,,25 June 2002,Close your Eyes,"The Alice books are one of the two richest works of literature yet produced. Of the best literature, Alice lends itself to cinematic reinterpretation. And this filmmaker has vision.But Alice is a coherent work, following the 'apprentice' novel and having kabbalistic structure. This film is episodic, each episode conceived as a different world, connected only by doors. The stories establish an abstract world, a world of logic so pure that the weaknesses of logic are apparent. That's only in part attempted here.Though in Czech, there is some dainty wordplay: Alice is messing about in her drawers. Initially, these contain drawing equipment, later scissors. The filmmakers' signature 'large person in small room' image is used here in the episode where 'Maryanne' (Alice plus her 'house) is attempted entry by Bill the lizard, Dodgson's image of sperm. Bill is mirrored later in the frog-footman, heavily phallic as is an introduced sequence where the feet themselves become penile, then advisory.Svenkmajer understands the cards as Tarot, a seldom understood insight and adds a vignette of the March Hare and Hatter playing cards (almost certainly a nod to 'Seventh Seal'). There's some very good visual handling of inside/outside ambiguities, and stage/reality shifting -- this alone makes this project worth sharing. But aside from that, it seems that the magic of Alice's world has yet to be tapped by a filmmaker.Note: in Carroll's vision, innocence trumps all: logic is seen as manmade and fallible. In this world confabulated reasoning threatens but no one really loses their head. Not so in Svenkmajer's bleak world. Heads really are lost. Innocence is at least dumbfounded and possibly unreal (those socks). Many heads are already decayed with only the skull remaining. Some beings are composed of empty skulls alone or with some ambulatory object. This is not a happy man, nor a world with any sunshine. I would not give these images to any child."
4,Alice,9,8 May 2000,"Through the Looking Glass, Darkly","Animation legend Jan Svankmajer applies his distinctive style to Lewis Carroll's most famous creation, crafting one of the most original and unforgettable takes on Alice's adventures ever put to film. Having previously adapted Carroll in his 1971 short film, ""Jabberwocky,"" Svankmajer returns to the author's work with this amazing feature-length film. Employing a magnificent blend of live action and stop-motion animation, he uses many of Carroll's ideas as jumping-off points. Many of the characters are reconstructed as nightmarish abstracts of the way they have usually been depicted in previous adaptions. The white rabbit is a stuffed real rabbit who keeps his watch tucked in a sawdust-leaking gap in his chest. The Dormouse has been reduced to a creepy crawling foxlike hide, and the Caterpillar is a sock with eyeballs and teeth that sews its eyes shut when it sleeps. Although familiar characters such as the Mock Turtle and the Cheshire Cat are left out, Svankmajer's film is incredibly faithful to the book's sense of fantasy and absurdity. The minimal dialogue and pronounced sound effects also add to the overall unsettling mood. The key to truly appreciating this version is to forget the common associated imagery from other adaptions, and treat this as its own entity. Just as a dream makes a totally different impression on you than a person you describe it to (regardless of how well you describe it), this film is one man's surreal interpretation of another man's surreal description. The skull-headed birds, walking dolls, and broken-down furniture of Svankmajer's world make this a pretty disturbing telling of Alice's journey, but a masterful, enthralling, and undeniably unique one as well."
5,Alice,,22 September 2004,Looking Glass shows Nightmare!,"We have all be introduced by either the written form or the theatrical form of the story of ""Alice in Wonderland"". Unfortunately, I feel that most of us have been introduced to this story through the film version instead of the written word. Sad as it may seem, we have all been sucked into either the Disney version, the Care Bear's version, or better yet even the recent made-for-TV version that was on ABC. So, with that being said, we all then know the story of Alice's journey through Wonderland. For all of you who have perhaps missed out on this fabled children's tale, let me recap for you quickly:White Rabbit, Small and Big, Caterpillar, Tweetlede & Tweetledum, the Walrus, the pig baby, the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter, ""Off with their heads!!!"", the Cheshire cat, and the Alice dream. Although that may seem like a jumbled line of words and phrases, that actually accurately sums up the entire plot of the children's story. What surprises me is that over time the film versions of this story have not changed. They have continued to show this innocent child being swept up in this imaginary and beautiful ""Neverland"" where she finds herself being the center of attention. I am not sure if studios are afraid to topple the Disney version, or if there is no creativity running through the minds of writers to make a fresh new story of this old tale, but something needed to be done. It was a tired story, that needed a modern day face-lift. With this said, let me introduce you to the Czech version of this fairy tale. While I applaud it for taking a much darker twist to this story, I do denounce it's use of stop motion animation to create the impossible.Lewis Carroll, the author of the story, really intended ""Alice in Wonderland"" to be a very scary and dark story for children, and until Disney put their hands on it...it was. What Czech director Jan Svankmajer has done brought back the darkness to Alice. Almost taken from a page out the directing book by David Lynch, it abruptly begins with Alice announcing that she is going to watch a movie...this movie to be exact. She then proceed to play in her room. The movie does follow the actual story of Alice, but it takes a nightmarish version of the favorite characters. For example, the White Rabbit constantly looses his stuffing, only to pull his watch out of his stomach to proclaim that ""He is very late for a date"". He refills himself by eating wood chips that immediately fall back out of him. At the Mad Hatter party, a wind-up March Hare sits during the entire scene and butters watches to make sure that the gears get oiled. The lady who was watching the baby who is actually a pig is portrayed in this film as a frog footman who battles flies with a very lifelike tongue. Even the smallest of characters are evil. There is a scene with a door mouse that crawls up Alice's head when she is sitting in a pool of her own tears, and proceeds to set up camp in her hair. For children...I think not...original...I think YES! While it even ends the same as the other versions of ""Alice"", the feeling that it leaves in your mind and stomach afterwards will be remembered further more than the cutesy animated version.I tried hard to like this movie. It was art, it was foreign, it was from my native country...but I just couldn't connect with the stop-motion animation.I don't want to stray you the wrong way, if you enjoy this style of animation, then I really recommend this film to you. I guarantee that you will never think of ""Alice in Wonderland"" in the same way. The symbolism was very strong and very poignant. I enjoyed how the feeling of Wonderland actually being a part of the house. I loved how the director used household items to create this normally ""pretty or cuddly"" characters. I also enjoyed the darkness to this film. When I think about it, I don't think of ""Alice in Wonderland"" as a children's story. A young girl follows a rabbit through an uncharted area (not worried that she is not home) and creates havoc all throughout this peaceful town. When she is finally caught, her punishment handed down by the elected Queen is not fulfilled...instead she awakens only to discover that it was a nightmare. I was always curious why there were so many cute characters in a nightmare. I think Svankmajer saw the darkness in the story and brought it out in this version. Overall, I enjoy seeing another side of a story that our society loves so much. I love seeing artists take a vision that we have all seen before and turn it into their own design. I think this was done with this film. I applaud my Czech friend for all of the work on this film, and I suggest tackling yet another children's classic soon!!Grade: *** out of *****"
6,Alice,,8 August 1999,"Fascinating, horrific - just like the book","How best to interpret such a well-known classic in movie terms? Well, Jan Svankmajer, clearly an artist himself (a Czech version of Peter Greenaway) does it by extracting the essence of the book; the black humour and droll critique of Victorian society, investing it with his own rich surrealistic imagery. (Disney is not in the picture!)Alice, played by a beautiful, doll-like girl, is energetic, brave and simple-minded, while her surroundings gradually go bonkers in ritual displays of nonsensical social custom. Svankmajer's celebrated mastery of dolls is on superb display, and dead objects, mostly worn, tattered and grotesquely animated, take on nightmarish properties. Foodstuffs certainly look repellent when sliding noisily across the kitchen-table!The start of the movie is classic Svankmajer: Alice lies on the floor of her room, idly throwing pebbles into a half-empty tea-cup. (seen as a series of hypnotically repeated actions). The White Rabbit, here a stuffed specimen inside a glass display-cage, suddenly comes to life, puts on clothing hidden under the floor of his cage, cuts the wires that fasten his feet to the floor, breaks the glass, and he's off!Svankmajer's ""Alice"" is the only version that comes close to rendering what Lewis Carroll's book is all about. It's a top notch art-movie for discerning audiences."
7,Alice,10,24 February 2001,"Beautiful, disturbing, creepy, bizarre.","There is simply nothing i can say derogatory about this movie. Jan Svankmajer is a genius in his mixture of live footage and animation. His work is at once beautiful and disturbing, yet hypnotic in its use of visual style. there are very few animators with his unique style and flair. carrolls Alice was quite adult in tone, something that previous cinematic versions failed to bring across, possibly seeing the childrens market that could be capitalised upon. I would urge anyone who has seen Alice in Wonderland or has read the books to watch this if they can, and marvel at his unusual take on the story. Full of dreamlike and creep imagery, this is one movie that will stay with you for a while...."
8,Alice,9,5 December 2001,Wanna give your kiddies nightmares for the rest of their lives?,"About five years ago, when I had just graduated from high school, a friend of mine who had been to college introduced me to the works of Jan Svankmajer. He had checked out a VHS copy of three short films, Darkness/Light/Darkness, Male Games, and The Death of Stalinism in Bohemia. All three of them were works of great genius, and I immediately stored Svankmajer's name in my vault. So it's sad that it took me all five of these years to see another one of his works. I had thought about buying his Faust back when DVDs were dirt-cheap (do you remember those happy days?), but had passed over it for something else. Now I finally found another one of his films, Alice, this one a feature, his adaptation of Lewis Carrol's Alice's Adventures of Wonderland. And, wow, this is one frightening little film, a mix of live-action (well, one little girl) and stop-motion animation of characters like the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. Stop-motion animation has always looked creepy, and Sankmajer knows it. He also knows that dead animals are scary, and he incorporates their bones into his animation. It makes the whole film more visceral and surreal.
There are two parts of this film that deserve particular attention. 1) the soundtrack. There is no musical score, and the only music at all is the tiny piece that plays over the closing credits. No, by soundtrack I am referring to the sound effects, and they are absolutely amazing. 2) the setting.The original novel and the Disney film set the story in a bizarre forest. Sankmajer sets the story in a delapidated house, with rotting and filthy wooden beams everywhere, creaky doors, and old cabinets. The setting is what makes the film particularly creepy.As for standout scenes, the caterpillar is pretty awesome. The very best scene, though, is definitely the tea party, with the Mad Hatter and March Hare. Svankmajer's conception of those two characters and of the tea party is truly inspired, and ranks among the best scenes in cinema, in my opinion.So is it perfect? No. The idea to have Alice speak all the lines, and then show her lips speaking such words as: ""The Mad Hatter said"" every two minutes grows annoying quickly, and the film would perhaps have been a masterpiece had this flaw been avoided. It seems to be in there for adding time, and it's truly unfortunate. I also wish that Svankmajer would have hurried up the beginning of the film, so as to get to other great scenes in the novel. It takes a half hour before Alice gets into Wonderland, and that's the only time the film grows boring. Whatever. This is still a great film. 9/10."
9,Alice,6,8 December 2007,Terrifying nightmare explores the reverse of the classic Alice story,"This film mixes the live action of just one actress - Alice - with a ghoulish array of stop-motion animated characters and objects. Whereas Lewis Carroll's original ""Alice in Wonderland"" story is a celebration of childhood innocence, fantasy, and magical belief, Svankmajer's ""Alice"" tells the reverse - the loss of childhood innocence through the pain of coming to terms with a less-than magical world. Inspired by the original tale, Svankmajer uses Carroll's idea of a childishly implausible and wild dream to symbolise an escape from a tormented childhood, rather than a daydreaming fantasy in the sun.With very little dialogue at all, Alice's job as an actress is restricted entirely to responding appropriately to the puppets - which involves no more than recoiling or widening her eyes. This takes nothing away from the film, however; Alice's muteness is a reflection of the classic ""children should be seen and not heard"" oppressive school of parenting. Indeed, Alice is seen throughout the film to, despite the hellish surroundings, still wipe her feet on doormats, remove her shoes before entering rooms, and do as she is told. She has been brought up through a harsh discipline that keeps her mute, polite, under control and unquestioning - indeed the very first scene of the film shows her older sister wordlessly slap her for being curious as to the contents of a book. This oppressive discipline is part of what makes up Alice's dismal reality, and hence is part of what she is both trying to escape and rebel from by dreaming.The sad result is that even Alice's dreams are tormented. Children can only dream about the things presented to them in reality. In the first scenes of the film, the camera pans across Alice's room and displays all the junk carelessly surrounding her - a keen viewer will notice that these are the very same objects that Svankmajer later animates inside Alice's dream. It is precisely because Alice's real world is so abysmal that her dream reflects it. Her house seems devoid of life - we never see any parents, and the sister is still out by the riverside - and the house itself is claustrophobic, dark and utterly unfit for human habitation. The ornaments are stuffed bugs, the only visible food is being pickled in tightly clasped jars, and every single surface is smothered in brown grime. The lack of any other life in the house and the lack of any form of homely care, all depict a tragedy of childhood neglect - Svankmajer blames the nightmare entirely on the parents.Within her dream, Alice suddenly finds that her room expands outwards into an endless muddy plain. This expanse, a dream of freedom, is tragically desolate and uninviting. Nevertheless, she follows one of her now-animated ""toys"" (the white rabbit) out into the field. Over the course of the film she will meet with a sailing rat, a truly insane depiction of the Mad Hatter and March Hare, and the murderous Queen of Hearts. But ultimately these are only the dream-animated versions of toys Alice detests. The truly sinister characters in her dream are those that come directly from her house, her life. The pickled jars of food turn out to be mixed with drawing pins, the ""Drink Me"" and ""Eat Me"" potions and cakes are bottles of ink and nondescript tarts, a mousetrap spells the demise of the sailing rat; when left on her own in a room, its contents attack her - slabs of meat slither around, bread turns to a porcupine of nails, food cans turn out to contain the stuffed beetles used as ornaments in her house (now living).It is in this scene that Alice first starts to experience some symbolic victory. Throughout the film we see Alice begin to show more curiosity, begin to learn, begin to rebel against what she is told to do, and begin - most importantly - to come to terms with her surroundings. She is ultimately locked away in a dark room - the culmination of all the negative forces around her - trapped inside a doll of herself. Nothing could be more symbolic of the repressive upbringing that has spawned this twisted dream. She has realised that she's been made into a doll - inhuman. It is with this realisation that Alice achieves her first rebellion, tearing her way out of the doll and - through unhindered curiosity - discovers the key to leave the room by.We are constantly reminded that the dream is a learning process for Alice. Every single time there is dialogue within the film, we immediately see Alice's lips say the words ""...the March Hare said"", or ""...Alice thought to herself"". These metatextual scenes suggest Alice is fully aware that this is all a story of her own imaginings. At bare minimum, it suggests that Alice has a level of awareness that oversees the story as a whole - she is looking upon these events with some purpose.Alice wakes from her dream a changed person. She has grown up the hard way - her last vain attempt at a childish fantasy built from her sordid life has led her to come to terms with how reality really is. She has learnt that we cannot be mute and polite little girls - the world will attack us, and we must defend ourselves. It's a sorry world-view she ends up with, but one necessary for her to be able to live in the neglected environment she's been brought up in. Thus the film ends with her own decision and dialogue - ""the rabbit is late again"" - she snaps a pair of scissors - ""perhaps I'll cut his head off"".Svankmajer's ""Alice"" is a masterpiece of stop-motion animation. Puppets come terrifyingly to life, and the surreal dream Alice undergoes is an intensely striking barrage of disturbing images. It is no film for children."
10,Alice,10,12 October 1999,the freaky Alice,"This by far is one of my favourite movies as well as dark city and the city of lost children. I think this is how Alice in wonderland should be . In this version the only human actor in the movie is Alice herself . Alice enters a wonderfully creepy world where nothing is What it seems. This movie is also quite interesting visually ,Like when Alice is entering wonderland in a creaky old lift going down past jars of marmalade with pins in them and the speaking parts with the extreme close ups of her mouth . This movie definatly captures the dream-like feel of the original Alice in wonderland."
11,Alice,8,18 May 2007,Stunning,"Wow, an 'Eraserhead' for children. This film has some of the most gorgeous imagery in an animated film that I've seen. I don't remember too much of ""Alice in the Wonderland"" from the Disney version that I've seen a couple years ago, but I've got a hunch it didn't involve a girl crawling through a drawer after a rabbit with clicking gopher teeth and a limited diet of sawdust that he has a problem containing in his body, only for her to be left in a room that she fills with her own tears while a small rat has a cookout on her head. ""Alice"" is a re-telling of the popular children's tale, but it's a vivid and imaginative version that has the ability to disturb to the very same effect of the David Lynch film. The stop-motion animation enhances the creepiness of the film where familiar characters are given a Gothic and dark makeover. The story takes place in an old fashioned setting; the walls faded with age and abandonment. I loved the setting of this odd little tale and its very morbid idea of a ""wonderland"" and its characters including a frog with a very realistic tongue, a ""catapiller"" that we wouldn't normally think of such, and a moving wad of meat. The resulting film is a stunning achievement. My only somewhat minor qualm, the narration of the main character Alice's lips popping up repetitively throughout the film really started to get grating in the first couple of minutes. However, completely random and unpredictable, ""Alice"" moves at a somewhat slow pace but develops a level of coherency in the midst of all its strange happenings. The sounds, all though a bit loud, give so much life to the smallest objects. The film effectively evokes the emotions of the human psych that a surrealist film should aim for. And, in the context of a celebrated children's story, it elevates its effect with jarring imagery and sound that make it memorable and an important film in the history of animated film."
12,Alice,9,13 July 1999,Rich in imagination,"While not as overtly creepy or unsettling as Jonathan Miller's BBC adaptation (which falls apart towards the end, anyway), Svankmajer's great achievement lies in his version's huge versatility of imagination. Alice's comments are dehumanised as we focus on a huge close-up of her mouth, and the creatures she encounters are bizarre fragments of the familiar world (eg the caterpillar is an enormous sock). And let's not forget that the quirky humour of this version mirrors Carroll's own. To compare this to Disney (other than favourably, anyway) would be a great insult."
13,Alice,2,11 August 2009,Extremely unenjoyable,"Rather than enjoy this film I could only endure it. And was extremely glad to see the end. I might as well get through what I DID find positive which is simply how well made this film is. The stop-motion technique is perfected by Jan Svankmajer. Right, now that's out of the way..I just don't understand why this film is so inaccessible. The sound is what I found to be the most irritating aspect, with every single action in the film being accompanied by a massively exaggerated (and LOUD) noise. As many others have mentioned the voice-over of 'said the white rabbit' also contributes to making this film ridiculously annoying.Away from the sound issue I just find this film stupidly pointless. You can make a film using stop-motion/surrealist techniques that is enjoyable, I'm sure, but clearly Svankmajer hasn't attempted this. There's nothing that could draw me in to watch this again. It drones on and on with the main character of Alice being someone you really can't connect with, making me wish it was actually an unhappy ending for her. While I'm not saying don't watch this film, because it certainly divides opinions from surrealist film fans, it's comfortably one of the worst I've ever had to sit through."
14,Alice,10,24 February 2010,Alice in David Lynch Land,"I'm not sure Carroll meant for his book to be interpreted in such a dark and creepy way, but if that's the way ya' wanna see it, that's the way ya' wanna see it. This film made me want a prescription for antibiotics. Everything here is sharp and rusty. Not to mention all the icky bugs and dead things and moldy cheese and...whats up with eating sawdust? that can't be good for you. Should kids see this? they get all sorts of stupid ideas and might try some of these things. There was a rusty sharp nail in the orange marmalade. I'm sure this whole thing would have given the author, Carroll, nightmares. I'm sure he would have wanted antibiotics also.I find it pretty hard to watch this film without screaming, and afterwards I sort of feel like I might need a padded cell(actually i wonder if its Svankmajer who needs the padded cell), but I realize that Svankmajer is a talented and artistic film maker and you have to accept his vision. I didn't say get used to it, I never will probably, just accept it.Film makers have always interpreted Lewis Carroll's book however they envisioned it. When Carroll's book was faithfully adapted in 1972 based on the original Tenniel illustrations and stuck closely to Carroll's actual dialogue and used his poems from his text, audiences yawned and poo-pooed the film and still do in favor of flashier versions. If people wanted a faithful adaptation like they say they do, they would be more than satisfied with the 72' version or even the excellent Eva LeGallienne/Florida Friebus revival on KCET in the late seventies.I like this film I really do.It scares the BeeJeezus out of me, but I like it."
15,Alice,3,2 February 2005,Cool looking but DULL!,"Great imagery in this film...the animal skulls, the bread that sprouts nails, etc. Very interesting to look at, even though the animation itself isn't really that great. However, the pacing is SOOOOOO SLOOOOOWWWW, and the repetitive ""said the white rabbit"" mouth is so frequent and annoying, this film is almost unwatchable. I think the basic problem is that there is no plot, just a series of weird events, and once you're done being awed by the visuals there is no reason to keep watching...you don't give a damn about what happens to Alice, because she has no noticeable personality. Would have made a great short."
16,Alice,6,2 November 2003,"""creepy tedium"", said the girl","I really wanted to enjoy this movie much more than I did. First, I rented this movie along with Faust and Little Otik. I watched this one first as it was the earliest of the 3.I enjoy foreign films, and art films, and stop motion animation and puppetry and this movie is all of these things, however, i can't help but wonder why on earth this was dubbed.  I can read subtitles and would have enjoyed hearing if the young actress that plays Alice was as monotonous of voice as her British voice-over. even if I overlooked the poor dub why on earth was the foley also dubbed? all sound effects from breaking dishes to footsteps to creaking puppet arms etc, was on this dubbed sound track, making for a too loud and cloying sound experience.  I like the idea that you immediately ""get"" that Alice is making up this story from her imagination as she goes along. hence the ""said the white rabbit"" but to have her repeat this narration voice over in monotone over and over and over again made the experience needlessly painful.like the mad hatter scene, the puppetry was excellent and the animation was great, but to hear each line of dialog followed with a close up shot of Alice's mouthspeaking who said what was too much of a diversion and took me out of the story. I just kept saying to myself: ok ok we get it, enough all ready. Just let the freakin puppets talk!Good things about this movie: the animation was fantastic. also the use of things, that would presumably be in a child's room, as the characters props was great. eg: socks as caterpillars, a  doll house and tea set. it made it very reasonable that a child's imagination would fathom such things.the scene with the door-mouse making camp, was enchanting.I just wish I could say I liked it more.  I liked Faust better than Alice, and I like Little Otik better than Faust and Alice.6.5/10"
17,Alice,3,23 April 2006,its not clever to be this inaccessible,"I can help but feel that this film is pointless and pretentious. although it does contain some moderately impressive animation there were no moving skeletons in ""alice in wonderland"" and Svankmeiyer has simply taken this book and turned it into any of his uninspired collection of needlessly grotesque images. Svankmeiyer uses annoying shots (said the white rabbit) and endless digietic noises ( that sound like listening to a building site with an evil hangover) to simply infuriate the viewer as if there is some artistic merit in making a film that is painful to watch. The tea party scene (which in Disney's version may have been a bit too light and fluffy) simply went around in circles for fifteen tedious minutes, possibly re-using most of the footage 2 or 3 times. The use of repeated shots of Alice's mouth is nauseating in the extreme, I understand the need to not use dialogue in a conventional sense to show that this is in Alice's imagination but silence would seem like bliss in comparison. I generally enjoy surrealist films when ,ade with some recognisable narrative but people must realise there is a line between a film that is surreal and a film that is intentionally awful whatever point is being made like this or Le chien Andalou. Carrols impression of a opium induced hallucination has been turned from something humorous and endearing into something that is simply dreadful. All you elitists should be happy with the Disney version, at least that doesn't give the viewer a migraine and a variety of mental health problems Unless you have to watch this for your studies avoid like the plague."
18,Alice,4,4 July 2006,Lethargic retelling of a classic story,"On the one hand, I respect director Jan Svankmajer for having the guts to make this; a stop-motion animated version of Lewis Carroll's classic story, 'Alice in Wonderland' - but on the other hand; I resent him for not making it better. I saw the Disney version of the story immediately before seeing this; and the differences between the two are clear - and I'm not just talking about the obvious ones. Disney's version of the story is bright, lively and exciting - while this version is dark and ominous; but also turgid and rather dull, and just like the movement of most of its characters; this film doesn't run smoothly. I can't imagination that this is the way that Lewis Carroll wanted his story to be told, and although I'm usually all for innovation in cinema; I'm going to have to make an exception for this film. The plot mostly sticks to the layout of the original story, although there are a few notable differences, and follows a young girl's imaginative journey through her own imagination as she comes up against a number of strange and ludicrous characters.I can't imagine that this was anything but a labour of love for its director; but all the same, it must have been a nightmare to film. Many of the puppets look like they must have cost a few pence to create, but they're animated with care and attention; although their movements are often slow and lethargic, and not very exciting to see. I can only really recommend this film to people that like to see everyday objects moving around, as that makes up the vast majority of the running time. Kristýna Kohoutová is the only actress in the film and appears in every sequence in which her character isn't represented by a doll. The fact that the film does star such a young girl increases it's cult value as it's made all the more bizarre by it. I can see why a lot of people like this film; as it's very different to most others; and although I can give a film plaudits for daring, I can't do that if the resulting film isn't very good. I liked the way that the director concentrated on the dark elements of the story - for example, off with their heads, and the way that the more inventive scenes from the story are brought to the screen; but other than that I can't say I got much enjoyment out of this film."
19,Alice,10,27 June 2005,More of an experience than a story,"This was certainly an interesting movie. ""Alice"" is a rather original take on the Alice In Wonderland story many of us are familiar with, but with numerous twists.The theme is quite removed from the original story. The woodsy locale has been replaced with an abandoned house in an abandoned slum; the white rabbit, with a disturbing living taxidermy display. Many of the original characters, and even scenes in the story, are represented in a similar nightmarish fashion.The pacing is rather slow compared to standard movies. In most films, scenes are generally sped up to keep the viewer interest. As a result, we don't see a hero eat their entire breakfast, drive a car from one destination to another, or do any other thing in the time it would take to do so in real life.Not so here. ""Alice"" takes place almost entirely in real-time. Everything Alice experiences, we experience with her. I have only seen one other movie attempt that, and that movie was ""Phone Booth"". However, Alice's world is not as chaotic as that of the main character from the other movie, so what we have here is more of a slow, gradual trip through the many different things Alice experiences, at her own pace.Alice herself seems to press on almost as if she were in a dream, or simply dazed by the odd goings-on around her. Her facial expression is somewhat blank, much like a child who is lost in a world she does not understand, although there are a few events which manage to stir up some emotion in the melancholy girl. Overall, Alice just seems almost resigned to her fate, as if she were simply pressing on in a completely foreign, creepy, and sometimes intimidating environment.This movie is really more of an experience than it is a story, with its seemingly random events all occurring in real-time, but it's an experience I'm glad I was able to have. Some will absolutely hate this film for its unusual style, but for those who are more open-minded, it might be worth looking into."
20,Alice,9,27 May 2013,Dark Alice,"My favourite screen adaptation of Carroll's classic novel, because it's so different from the cute dreamy candy-coloured wonderland which Alice is usually visiting. I still haven't read the source material; I probably think I've become too old for it by now, but that's just a stupid excuse. Or maybe because I know the story inside and out (as depicted by Disney and other overly optimistic offerers). That's why I was so positively surprised by Svankmajer's dark and eerie version, far from what I would have expected even when I read the filmmaker's name. Svankmajer does make strange little films, from what I know and saw so far, sometimes even quite whacky stuff. This film is no exception, but it has an uniquely morbid atmosphere due to the fascinating stop-motion animation and the unsettling sound effects. There's no conventional dialog which is reduced to a minimum and mostly recited by Alice herself from a third person perspective with the attachment ""...says the white rabbit"" et al. This technique doesn't allow us to feel with and for Alice and to delve into her fate; it rather makes us aware that we are merely within a tale. There's no way we can get lost in the intellectual world of six-year-old Alice; she remains to be a self-contained, pretty incommunicative little girl that's just trying to get out of this nightmare (without being ignorant to oddities that constantly pass her way out), and we are just observers of her dream. It's a film made not for everyone for sure; as a squeamish romantic or a lover of the more optimistic versions, you'd probably hate it. I, for one, am all in for a morbid, decayed, rotten cinematic vision, especially when it hits a children's classic and completely turns it upside down."
21,Alice,8,6 January 2008,captivating yet uncomfortable,"I was fairly young when I first saw this movie, nine I believe, I happened to stumble upon it on t.v. one night and I was immediately drawn in by the creepy images.This is not the Alice in Wonderland that we know! What I love about this film is it holds on to the bizarre, and sometimes frightening world Lewis Carrol created. Is it exactly canon with the book-No. Is it a Disney fest suitable for the young ones-No! Is it intelligent, captivating and entertaining-Yes! I'm now 27 and I still get chills watching the White Rabbit leave his display case. If you ever get the chance to watch it, do so. You may not like it, but you'll probably never see something so strange again."
22,Alice,2,11 August 2008,Alice in Daliland,"Imagine if you will some unfortunate young girl dropping acid in a depressing, grimy house and you have some idea of what Alice is like. We're told from the beginning that this is a film made for children. Nothing could be further from the truth. Gritty and grim with LOTS of tedious roughly done stop action photography tricks the film has none of the brilliance or nuance that the Alice In Wonderland/Through The Looking Glass stories do. Everything scrapes and scratches and looks dirty. A feeling of dread permeates, I wondered if Alice would die in some horrible way, then wanted her to. Narrarated endlessly by the little girl via up close lips reminded me of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which reminded me that that was a much better film. There wasn't a point or purpose to the story as far as I could tell, but maybe David Lynch could explain some of it. If you're a HUGE fan of stop action you might find it interesting, but don't let any of your children anywhere near it, they'll scream your house down."
23,Alice,3,11 October 2010,Motion Sickness,"Perhaps I am not so refined in my film appreciation technique as other reviewers, but as a lover of Alice in almost all her forms I must say that not only was I disappointed but sickened. The way the movie is presented is of course visually entertaining but to be honest I had to turn it off half way through to avoid vomiting. Its grotesque nature and repetitive motifs made me feel physically ill and though I never saw the end I doubt I will ever be able to handle watching it again to see it. If a ""The Ring"" style movie ever existed, this would be it.In parts it even annoyed me with its singular character focus. The original story is a rich tapestry of characters this film did little to portray. Perhaps I am missing out but I will never be a fan."
24,Alice,10,19 March 1999,Alice...the creepy version,"Start with the novel (Alice in Wonderland).  Measure the distance from there to the Disney animated version.  Now go the same distance in the opposite direction.  You end up at Svankmajer's Alice.  It's fairly faithful to Lewis Carroll...but just as Disney heightens the cute parts of the story, Svankmajer highlights the scary and threatening aspects.  His animation of real world objects, most of them apparently broken or discarded, establishes a dislocated world of damaged remnants.  This film is brilliant and very disturbing, and highly recommended for anyone who picked up on how creepy Alice in Wonderland really was."
25,Alice,3,28 July 2001,Alice in Dullsville,"Cool animation technique is way undermined by slow, slow pacing.If I had a watch, I'd be looking at it as frequently as the white rabbit does in the movie. If I had a rabbit, I'd rather be watching it for amusement.There was no sense of adventure, or even engagement. And this seemed like a very long 84 minute movie.Best avoided. 3/10."
26,Alice,3,14 October 2010,Not the real wonderland,"What a bad rendition of Alice In Wonderland. Now don't get me wrong, this could of been excellent. It started off with a creepy feel; which I feel Alice In Wonderland should feel like. But it just got cheesy and when the movie ended, you realized that many parts were left out. One thing I appreciated about the film was the use of stop and go motion. They made the White Rabbit pretty creepy looking and with the stop and go motion, it was a great added touch. What I didn't appreciate was the narration. Every time a character spoke, it was in Alice's voice and after there would be a close up of Alice's mouth narrating it. An example would be the White Rabbit would say, ""Oh I am late!"". Then they would show a close up of Alice's mouth and she would say, ""Said the White Rabbit"". This got to the point of annoying since it happened every time a character spoke. I will say that Kristyna Kohoutova did a nice job as Alice since she looked like an Alice. But for the most part, the movie was just not that good."
27,Alice,,9 November 2009,Style Over Substance,"""Neco z Alenky"" (1988) (being marketing as ""Alice"") is a triumph of style and form over substance. Czech animator Jan Svankmajer manages an animation style and production design that will hold most viewer's attention during the first viewing of this revisionist version of ""Alice in Wonderland"". A good thing as screenwriter Jan Svankmajer is no Lewis Carroll and his storytelling technique is all visuals. His technique can leave nothing to the imagination because the production's paltry audio (minimal dialog and no score) keeps one's imagination in neutral for the entire 84 minute running length.""Alice"" was the second of the four relatively recent efforts to ""out-weird"" Carroll by taking the framework of his story and constructing a feature film that reflects the director's inner child at the expense of the wit and wisdom of the source material.If a perverse homage is your cup of tea and you don't hold you own image of the Mad Hatter sacred, then you should check out this film along with the other three: Tim Burton's recent release, Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"" (2005), and the one that started the trend-Richard Elfman's ""Forbidden Zone (1982). Just don't use terms like brilliantly inventive and original because these things all go down a rather well-traveled path.Missing in all these, as it is in the more conventional treatments of Carroll's classic, is most of Carroll's wit and his main character's irritation with the rude and illogic she encounters in Wonderland. In ""Alice"" this stuff is replaced by macabre elements that mostly elicit a ""lose your lunch"" reaction.Svankmajer does a nice job directing his title character (played by Kristy'na Kohoutova'), she is not so much a proper Victorian girl as a knockoff of Pippi Longstocking with large eyes, good teeth, and a willful expression.The white rabbit has a much bigger part in the story than he did in the original. In this version he is a stuffed rabbit in a glass display case who pulls his feet free of the mounting nails, breaks the glass, and disappears into a nearby drawer. He spends the remainder of the film dodging Alice and leaking sawdust stuffing.Svankmajer goes symbolic throughout the film with doorknobs and drawer pulls. Alice is never able to just open a door or a drawer. Typically the knob comes off in her hand and she must devise a different way to gain access. Which sort of fits with the animator's instructions at the beginning of the film to close you eyes if you want to see something.But Svankmajer is more technician than storyteller so don't expect a lot of suspense and motivational elements. Most of the traditional Wonderland characters are here. Those like Bill the Lizard who had little to say in the original fare quite well. Those like the Mad Hatter whose charm was mostly in their witty banter come off pretty lame.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child. Comment"
28,Alice,8,11 December 2017,"Dark, surreal and not for children","A dark and surreal adaptation of Alice in Wonderland combining stop- motion animation and live action. It's not really a children's movie but as the dreams of Alice are unravelled in the wonderland, here more like a nightmare land, the close-up shots of narrations that represents an innocent child are quite distracting. This film is really daring in using such a popular children's story and turning it into a nightmarishly dark and surreal adaptation that shows Alice's dreams in which she's living the trauma that represents the things happening in real life. It's the repetition of certain events that clarify her view of the world treating her."
29,Alice,7,12 June 2017,An amazing and creepy slice of surrealism.,"I caught Jan Svankmajer's ""Alice"" (aka ""Neco z Alenky"") on Netflix recently, and had no idea what to expect. Let me just say: This interpretation of ""Alice In Wonderland"" is an amazing and dreamlike experience. It is perhaps a bit too creepy for the youngsters, but they won't have the patience for it anyway. For adventurous adults, it's a rewarding and fun slice of surrealism. This dark Czechoslovakian fantasy-film casts a strange spell. Largely free of dialogue, it loosely follows the familiar outlines of the Lewis Carroll story, depicting Alice's journey through Wonderland as a feast of bizarre perspective-tricks, charmingly creepy stop-motion, and intricate set-design.The film assumes the viewer's familiarity with Carroll's story, and it uses that familiarity to its advantage as it re-interprets many of the story's most iconic gambits. For instance, rather than crossing paths with a chatty white rabbit in a waistcoat, this film's Alice is stunned to discover a taxidermied rabbit in her room suddenly come to life, pulling the nails from its paws and ""bleeding"" sawdust as it frees itself from its glass enclosure.The rabbit then climbs a mountain of rocks, which has somehow appeared in the place of one wall of Alice's room, and it disappears into the drawer of a drawing-table which has appeared there. Alice follows, and after she discovers how to open the drawer, we watch as she -- impossibly -- squeezes inside. The drawer becomes a tunnel, which leads into a dungeon-like stone chamber, where the rabbit is preparing himself a meal in a tiny kitchen.One sequence leads to the next in exactly the same dreamlike way that Carroll's book proceeds -- but this film's version of events seems considerably more bizarre, if only perhaps because many of the stop- motion creatures have a creepy, threatening look about them.The film bears some resemblance to the works of the Brothers Quay, whose short films (such as ""Street of Crocodiles"") famously influenced the look of the music videos made by the band ""Tool.""""Alice"" is definitely a little on the slow side, but its relentlessly inventive surrealism kept me watching for the duration. I definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in such dreamlike experiences."
30,Alice,7,10 June 2017,It's fine,"Yeah ... I don't think I'm as big of a fan of this as many people are. It undeniably has a lot of amazing imagery ... it also has a lot of tiresome rummaging around in drawers and similar tedium. I like it, but if it's the best screen version of ""Alice in Wonderland"", that's largely because of how abysmally unimaginative and dreary most other versions are."
31,Alice,8,24 February 2017,The dark side of Lewis Carroll,"There are many adaptations of Lewis Carroll's classic story. Not all of them are great, a few being pretty bad, but most of them are decent to great though a perfect one is yet to be made.Of all the adaptations of 'Alice in Wonderland', Jan Svankmajer's is the darkest, the most surreal and the most bizarre. As well as the most original, while remarkably staying true to the book's spirit and maintaining most crucial details and characters. Whether 'Alice' is the best 'Alice in Wonderland' adaptation is up for debate, for me it isn't, but it's one of the better and more interesting ones.'Alice's' dialogue and way of narrating does get annoyingly repetitive and is at times unnecessary. It is also a shame about the omission of The Cheshire Cat, one of the book's best characters and often a breath-of-fresh-air scene-stealer.However, 'Alice' looks stunning with lovingly detailed austerely dilapidated interior sets and so many of the stop-motion images, surreal in nature, are fantastically nightmarish (like the fish, skeleton birds and the raw meat), complete with beautiful and atmospheric cinematography. The soundtrack consists of loud, continuous sound effects, that add very well to the strangeness and eeriness.Svankmajer's style shines through loud and clear while still not masking Carroll's storytelling which shines brighter even with the darker tone and modern setting (rather than the dream-like picturesque one). Some may consider the story rambling and episodic, as timeless as the book is it does have an episodic nature so that respect was appropriate. This episodic nature was put to good and imaginative use here, and there are some great scenes especially the Caterpillar and the Mad Hatter's Tea Party. The wonderland characters make their impact, especially White Rabbit in an expanded role and the awesome Caterpillar.Krystyna Kohoutova is a very strong Alice, understated and winsome.Overall, a dark and unique adaptation and a very good one. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
32,Alice,4,9 June 2016,This film will make me fail my exam!,I had to watch this film as part of a surrealism topic we are studying in are A2 film studies exam. We've already watched it once in class and I had to close my eyes and block my ears. The film is the creepiest I have ever seen and I couldn't bare to watch it. Four months later and I wanted to try and re-watch it so I can recall it in my exam. I couldn't get through the first 5 minutes. I was in the library when I physically jumped out my seat at the sight of the Taxidermied White Rabbit that looks like something nightmares are made of. I understand that its just not for me and I can see that a lot of effort and good direction has gone into making this film therefore I won't rate it too harshly. However unless your a real vankmajer fan then I doubt this film will appeal to you. It is scarier than any other horror film that I've seen and I'm getting chills down my back just writing this review. 4/10
33,Alice,6,8 December 2014,a true eye-opener if judging on its own merits,"A loose adaptation of Lewis Carroll's ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND, this otherworldly piece of work marks the first feature-length filmmaking from Czech stop- motion animation master Jan Svankmajer since he threw himself into this line of work in the 1960s. It is live action combines stop-motion, Alice is play by the cherubic Kohoutová, while her smaller version and other characters are all made of puppets (mostly grotesque) and cards (""off with their heads"", the Red Heart Queen often commands), and ""the wonderland"" is set in a neglected building, often Alice stumbles into a room with surrealistic happenings and there is always a desk with a drawer, and whenever Alice tries to open the drawer, she would mechanically pull out the drawer knob first, take a stumble, then use some instrument to open it. The repetition is rather unexciting for the feature-length, the same can be referred to the annoying close-up to Alice's lips whenever she do the voice-over of the lines of herself (sometimes her thoughts) and all the puppet characters, with the obdurate emphasis of mentioning the addresser in the end of each sentence. As much as I admire the fluid technique of the animation and its fantastic imagination of concocting such a surrealistic template, I can not dispel the awareness of some certain degree of frustration and boredom from time to time. Furthermore, it is not a children's film in any sense, the setting is creepy and uncanny, the characters including the white rabbit, the mad hatter, the March hare, the caterpillar, the frog and the fish, are more germane to appear in nightmares than day dreams, their behavior is irrational and repetitive, so is Alice's robotic acting, too amateur to invite viewers being involved profoundly. The recurring visual themes begin to take its toll in the long run, maybe short is a much more appropriate media for Svankmajer's art form, in any case, it is a beguiling novelty with some innovate ideas, plus it must take meticulous elbow grease to pull off such a big project, although I can be hardly enjoy this film, stand in awe of the final product, Svankmajer is a one-of-a-kind virtuoso in this particular tributary, this is a fact no one can contradict and the film is a true eye-opener if judging on its own merits."
34,Alice,10,29 August 2014,rabbit tracks,"Aha! We've all seen Disney's animated feature and Tim Burton's live-action feature, but you can't truly say that you've seen a movie version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" until you've seen Jan vankmajer's ""Něco z Alenky"". The animals are of course stop-motion (including a carriage that has a literal skeleton crew). Wonderland is not an enchanted forest, but what appears to be a derelict apartment building. Basically, it's a much darker interpretation of the story than we're used to. After all, Lewis Carroll's original story had nothing to do with cuteness.Whatever the case, I've liked every vankmajer work that I've seen, both his shorts and his feature films. Their sheer surrealism serves to remind us of a very important fact: animation is simply another type of filmmaking. It doesn't have to be ""family-friendly"". And believe you me, what you have in these movies is more like what you find in a Terry Gilliam movie! I recommend starting with vankmajer's shorts before watching one of his features. Even so, you're sure to like either one. Another feature is ""Little Otik"", based on a Czech folk tale."
35,Alice,7,29 August 2013,Imagine a film.,"Alice In Wonderland isn't exactly the most sane thing ever written, even in the context of children's stories. I have never read the books but I have been around seeing other versions (2010, being them more recent one I've seen) and I saw this film and I kind of liked it.While past adaptations have been directly aimed at kids or had a leaning towards kids and adults, Alice (1988) is most definitely for adults. You can kind of tell when you find out the director of this film also did Faust. The imagery, while creative, would give any child nightmares for a week at the least (and this is coming from someone who glorifies ""Return To Oz"" as all family entertainment).The stop-motion animation for this film is suitably ""dream-like"". I mean its weird, its unusual, its nothing that you'd ever forget. But, hey, so were the books. The Rabbit is a little freaky as were the other ""creative"" animation. The girl playing Alice does a remarkable job and even provides the voices for all the main characters giving it a kind of ""you're reading the book"" feel to it.Now the creativity, alone, has to be spoken for. Why? I firmly believe if you put Ingmar Bergman, Tim Burton and Andrei Tarkovskiy in a bag, shook it up, and told the end result to write something, it wouldn't be anywhere near as imaginative as this. One ""animal"" is literally bird wings and feet attached to a bed. Another is a crocodile with a skull head, eyelids (as freaky as that sounds) and the tip of the tail is bone.I have to say, there is no plot to this film. It is literally a girl looking around her room and creating a ""story"" out of it. If you think that this would be interesting then this is certainly for you, if you want a bright, cheery film for your kids while you, yourself, re-experience memories...steer clear."
36,Alice,8,27 March 2013,Defamiliarization,"vankmajer's ""Neco z Alenky"" (1988) is a wonderful celebration of imagination, of which Carrol's Alice stories are prime examples. There are times when the film might seem like a meandering sequence of events without clear climaxes, but then again this is at its best intentionally used to great effect: we are drained of many dramatic means, including music, and ironically the opening shot of the ""hot day"" is the most romantic and idyllic image in the film. Perhaps I should count the introductory exposition of Alice's room into this as well, so beautifully the light dwells on her face. Usually the fantasy world is the one with all the colour and fireworks. What then follows is a kind of reverse ""Caligari"" (1920), since what we see is not shaped by what will be revealed towards the end but what has been shown already in the beginning. The final scene when Alice wakes up, observing the room, underlines this very point.Many have lauded the film's ability and skill in defamiliarization, creating thus an atmosphere that very much takes us into the mind of a child, where even the most domestic and thus familiar object may regain a new life, strange and peculiar.There is a beautiful Blu-ray edition of the film released by the British Film Institute. It has, besides a lovely transfer, the most amazing set of extras one might think for Alice: the two ""Stille Nacht"" films inspired by Alice, made by Stephen and Timothy Quay."
37,Alice,10,25 November 2012,Dark Wonderland,"I found this film to be one of the most fascinating and beautifully made adaptations of Lewis Carroll's masterpiece: While the Disney version captured perfectly well the humor, joy and lighthearted elements of the ""Alice in Wonderland"" books, this movie does a great work portraying in a very original manner the other side of the same story, showing how dark and twisted it could beAnd yet, this is strangely faithful to the original story (Well, at least to a certain point) The result, in my opinion, was fairly impressive, being one of the best and most memorable works of Jan vankmajer, combining perfectly well stop-motion animation with live-action, while at the same time it includes many of the recurring motifs in the rest of the movies and shorts directed by this Czech filmmaker.I would recommend this movie to any viewer who wasn't completely satisfied by the Disney version of this same story, since ""Alice"" is able to show the dark and mature side of what is often considered just an ordinary fairy tale, despite being much more complex than that.9.5/10"
38,Alice,9,13 November 2012,It will change forever the way you see Wonderland,"First off, let's get something out of the way: this is not the kind of film designed to appeal to kids that are Alice's age (6 or 7?). Svankmajer's Alice pairs best with a preemptive shot of adolescence--and maybe even a booster shot some years down the road. The kind of nightmarish imagery displayed here begs some fortification on the part of the viewer.The condition of Alice's home situation suggests strongly that she is a lonely child quite often. There is an air of neglect about her room and all the objects in it; Alice herself isn't the squeaky-clean, outspoken child so often interpreted from the book. Her toys look old and tattered, as if from a rummage sale. There is a layer of smudge/filth covering nearly every surface. Left to herself, it is no wonder she must develop an unusually active imagination in order to brighten her circumstances.This re-imagining of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland is whimsical and morbid in equal measure. The genius of the director's vision lies in the way he faithfully follows the source material's plot, while at the same time turning our Disney-inspired, preconceived notion of this tale on its ear. You see the setting is actually a dilapidated old house -- bare wood floors host rooms devoid of decoration, often containing a single naked bulb as the light source and a lone writing desk of unknown purpose. M.C. Escher could have had a hand in designing this structure, the way that windows and doors open unexpectedly into other spaces, staircases and dumb waiters lead downward into what should be lower levels but aren't. The animal characters are stop-motion compositions of bare animal bones and household items; skulls wrongly attached to other animal skeletons and bodies, given rolling glass eyes to add facial expression of sorts and ""life""likeness. Everything is scuffed, dirty, worn, and badly in need of some comforting homeyness.Alice (an impossibly cute kid, she's the only thing of beauty in this ""Wonderland"")follows the white rabbit (a stuffed and mounted specimen which comes to life and pulls its feet from the display case by yanking the nails out first) from one room to the next on her adventure. She's not a very emotive Alice, reacting blankly to all the bizarreness; once or twice there is a closeup of her widening eyes. It's almost as if she's a doll. We see her lips mouthing the phrases ""Said the White Rabbit"", ""Demanded the Mad Hatter"", etc. throughout the narrative, which is our broadest hint that this is all Alice's show--her mind at play within the environment she knows well. It's also a distracting trope which I feel the film would be better off without.This is a Wonderland of cruelty and discomfort, where grime and neglect rule. Yet for all that, Alice retains her sense of pluck and curiosity. Alice doesn't have the verbal self-confidence I remember from the book, but she fights back against the weird forces of this dreamlike world and never gives up in trying to get that white rabbit to listen to her. Alice is redeemed by her strong spirit. You get the impression that she was born to rise above her sad circumstances in life -- and that makes her a hero worth cheering on.At the end of the film, I realized that I loved it. The stop motion skeleton animals were one of the many things about this adaptation that showed true originality. Director Svankmajer has crafted a wonderful thing and in this movie he really shows an understanding of a child's viewpoint. Watching it was a lot like remembering my own (much less morbid) childhood playtime. I can recommend this gem to anybody with a strong stomach and an appreciation for the unusual."
39,Alice,7,22 January 2012,If taxidermy and schizophrenia is your thing....watch this!,"I watched this as a kid, it was on channel 4 or something, DEAR GOD IT WAS DISTURBING. I can't believe people thought this was for children, I wouldn't let my children watch it. Although most children would probably find it boring, I actually quite liked it. But I am now having regular therapy sessions and I blame this entirely.... AND THE NIGHTMARES.JUST.WON'T.STOP..... The image of the white rabbit chattering it's teeth will be forever burned into my brain. CANNOT UNSEE!!!.... NOOOOOO!!!Anyway I have been searching for this for years, it's not very well known so was hard to find. I was curious to find out what it was called so that I could watch it again, I am a glutton for punishment. And I felt that I needed more therapy, I quite like being driven mad by bizarre and random images.Those teeth! NOOOOOO!!!"
40,Alice,,24 October 2011,"Hand-made nightmare, but never jam today","There was a clever bit of staging in another Svankmajer film I saw a few days ago, so I came to this looking for more. I figured if anything, the Alice story, with the entire film staged in the mind, would provide natural opportunities. Alas. I don't blame Svankmajer, he has craftily interpreted the story in a way that appeals to me; in place of overblown spectacle, a nightmare concocted from everyday material, whose handmade textures you can almost reach out and touch. Lofty imaginings from basement essentials. But it remains, from its original conception more than 100 years ago, a nightmare with no footing in a world that matters.It was, of course, designed to baffle logic, a carefully improvised surrealism before its time. After all it is about a young girl's subconscious efforts to apprehend the adult world; so she repeatedly shifts shapes looking for what would fit the door, the accepted shape that grants passage, but once there, she discovers a shapeless Wonderland with no coherence or sanity. But where you still stand to lose your head - in more ways than one.Svankmajer has translated superbly. The film is a long ramble, with riddles continuously thwarted, or diffused in puzzling images, and logic powerless to order the imagined world. During the courtroom scene she is expected to read from the script, but which is utterly nonsensical.The secret notion of course is the obvious; that it's all a purely internal vision of the imaginative mind weaving a narrative. But alas, grounded nowhere. So little time is spent above that the everyday objects she transports inside the fantasy are not charged with anything. Every once in a while, we see the girl's lips move as she shapes the world from the upper level."
41,Alice,,20 August 2011,inspiring to modern film makers but not such a great flick,"So I watched an art film called Alice, this ""film"" is a cult favorite of sort among art types. It came out in 1988 and was made by surreal artist Jan Skankmajer. So was this a good movie well no, but it is an interesting art film. Apparently great film makers like Tim Burton developed some of their early animation styles based on his work. In that sense it was very interesting, however though it was an interesting take on the classic ""Alice in Wonderland"" it was not good story telling. This is after all a great story this artist is interpreting. Why not actually incorporate the story with its beautiful dialog acted, and not read in sporadic bursts and as blind monologue. Additionally, the film had some very unintentionally disturbing images, especially the march hare. So should you watch this, if you are a huge fan of Tim Burton, or Michelle Gondry, or an art freak, maybe you will like it after all art is about individual interpretation, but as an easily watchable movie for most people including intellectual types, no you can definitely skip this one. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"
42,Alice,8,27 June 2011,Quoth Alice,"This was my 2nd excursion into the world of Svankmajer; after being thoroughly swept away by Faust, this was the next stop. The lack of human presence is comforting in itself, the actions do seem to take place in a land of fantasy, because retreating from reality is paramount But the intermittent and frequent appearance of Alice's mouth reminds us that this is just a narrative, fantasy is a story, take it or leave it. Fantasy cannot be taken too seriously. We try to mesh dreams with the real world, but we stumble upon our own ambivalence, and I feel this was represented by her shifting between the small doll and the big real girl. There are certain doors you cannot access when assuming a certain form. The message seems to be one of an amorphous, atemporal world there is a degree of overlap between physical entities, death is mocked, physical integrity is mocked as well; we fall apart, our entrails seep out, yet we are revitalized by our own bodily debris. This seems to be comparable to Alice's feeding on her internal world to nourish all aspects of her experience. Heads are cut off on a whim; yet, as the scene where the different animals' and Alice's heads are shown in an alternating manner on the same body, we are faced with the idea that, when boundaries are lost, we realize that every representation of self and others that we engender is colored by our own lens. Our defensive structure is what sets the stage Alice is both martyr and executioner. As she finds more and more keys, deeper niches in her mind are unlocked, and the pieces become ever more integrated. It would appear that, when returning to the real world, the overtly random aggression shown in her mind has been transposed into her waking life, and she voices that she will cut off the rabbit's head for being late, thus turning into her persecutor as a form of domesticating her murderous lust. Yet, it is still her mouth voicing over this thought reality mustn't be taken too seriously either, for it is also a narrative, our narrative, and we have painted the world as we have along our own storytelling lines. In this sense, dream and reality are the same The childish concept of deathlessness is a fragile saving grace that speaks beyond the conscious experience of adults, and perhaps it's a world we can only hope to return to once innocence is newly instilled by death."
43,Alice,7,2 October 2010,The Most Bizarre Version of Alice I Have Ever Seen,"This is a story of Alice, with a very odd version of Wonderland. The story follows the plot relatively close, but instead of the traditional rabbit hole, Alice crawls through drawers and into a bucket... and meets creatures made up of junk, puppet parts and dead animals.Most odd, and unique, is a sock with glass eyes for the Caterpillar. Other new developments include Alice changing into a doll -- first a small one, then a large one (which turns out to be merely a shell).The visuals have been described as ""grotesque, perverse, or disturbing, but overall not repulsive."" That seems fair -- this is creepy, but not outright scary or subversive. Just odd. Some have said it references ""Un Chien Andalou"" with sawdust (rather than ants) pouring out of the rabbit's hand... I do not know how intentional that was."
44,Alice,7,12 March 2009,Alice,"I think I liked the idea of seeing another adaptation of the Lewis Carroll classic, Alice in Wonderland, especially with stop motion from Czechoslovakia and Faust director Jan Svankmajer. It follows most of the same storyline, but with originally bizarre digressions, as Alice (Kristýna Kohoutová, the only flesh and blood character) says at the beginning, ""it's a film made for children... perhaps?"" So Alice follows the complex White Rabbit into the Wonderland world, where she also encounters the Caterpillar (made of a sock, a couple of glass eyes and false teeth), the Mad Hatter (an old wooden puppet) and March Hare (a wind up tatty puppet), and the King and Queen of Hearts (cards), and a new addition, as well as scary fish, skeleton birds, and a slab of raw meat? This is certainly more absurd than the Disney or Fiona Fullerton versions, it is darker, a light sinister feel, and even with its simplicity, the animation more than makes up for it, and makes this quite a watchable film. With English narration by Camilla Power. Very good!"
45,Alice,6,29 March 2008,"I haven't seen it in forever, but......","the last and only time I saw it was over ten years ago. However, since I saw it when I was 7, and saw it about three times, it should go on this list. Neco z Alenky is an Czechoslovakia movie, and is based on Alice in Wonderland. However, this is not you're typical, sweet, Disney version. Let's just say I had nightmares for weeks, and I had my first memorable awake/asleep hallucination or dream. It's also very, very odd, which is putting it mildly. It is only one human actress (Alice, duh), and the rest of the characters are puppets, that bleed sawdust (that's what I remember most.). I honestly don't remember a lot of it. But I do remember her descent in the rabbit hole. In this version, wonderland is a huge house, and her fall is actually her riding an elevator. She sees the jars, and they're filled with body organs and gross stuff. Yeah. I have to watch it again, because I don't remember it very well. I wouldn't recommend this version for little kids. Stick to the Disney version for the little ones."
46,Alice,8,15 November 2006,Dollness reality,"Adaptations of Lewis Carroll's absurdist classic aren't especially that rare, especially adaptations that seem much more adult-oriented. Jan Svankmejer's Alice, however, holds true to the original in a very noteworthy way: it simplifies rather than extends the effect, making it feel a lot closer in tone to the book than many other adaptations.The thing about surreal and absurd works is that it's often the smaller things that work, slight movements that are just acceptable to the world they're in that set off the eeriemeter in people's heads. Alice in Wonderland is wonderful because all of the characters are so straight forward about their peculiarity. Svankmejer's Alice is great because the stop-motion animation effect is so straightforward.Instead of trying to hide the fact that he's dealing with dolls and toys, Svankmejer simplifies the surreality by bringing more attention to them and the various ways they work. I think one of the nicest touches to this film is how Alice herself turns into a doll when she shrinks, making the dolls not necessarily inanimate objects animated but living objects that are just smaller representations of more accepted living objects. Also, in the world of a child's mind, toys are living things.This movie could be considered more adult than Alice in Wonderland... it seems that that book really interests adults more than children ultimately. For whatever reason, I wouldn't really recommend this movie to children unless a parent was around.--PolarisDiB"
47,Alice,7,12 November 2006,I traded my mental health for Svankmajer's Alice in wonderland.,"OK.. Yesterday I went at the library to rent a movie for my traditional pothead night with my friends. I was looking at the movies when I saw one with ""Svankmajer's Alice, Czechoslovakia"" written on it. ""How f*cked up that must be"", I said to myself. Then I arrived at home and smoked a joint with my friends, and then the movie began..At the beginning we found it SO hilarious, with the ugly rabbit and stuff, but after 20 minutes you just get over it and we saw that this movie was REALLY f*cked up. I found that it looked like a 2 hours bad trip. It wouldn't have been THAT crazy if there hadn't been the little girl's mouth every 2 minutes saying ""Said the white rabbit"". I mean, i'm an open minded person with a good independent cinema culture (I'm studying in cinema), but this movie is just TOO weird. I think I've never seen something as not sense-making as that. To resume, if you want to live a 2 hours nightmare, you should consider this movie."
48,Alice,7,30 August 2005,A fresh spin on an old story,"***Contains minor spoilers*** This version of Alice reminded me of the pretend games I used to play as a child. The original novel Alice in Wonderland and most of its subsequent adaptations are firmly ensconced in a dream world. Though Alice does seem to be dreaming in this film, most of the action takes place inside a house with the same furniture and objects showing up over and over again to serve different functions, much as a child can turn a table into a fort, a ship, a house, etc. I loved the two different viewpoints this movie gave me: an adult looking back on the richness of childhood games and a child trying to make sense of an adult world which seems utterly bizarre to her (collecting animal skulls, anyone?) I am a long-time Alice fan and I really appreciate this film for its originality and inventiveness. And Alice shrunken down to a doll should have been creepy but I found her utterly charming."
49,Alice,1,15 June 2013,'Said the White Rabbit' - avoid,"If you'd like a lumpy ceramic ashtray from a mental patient's therapy session, then this might be the movie for you. Like garbage art, not bound to any rules of quality, Jan Svankmajer here puts some little girl into filthy decrepit locations and films poorly executed stop action experiments with no connection to plot. Some who don't understand that random isn't the same as art may simply adore it. One possibility for college kids chasing a good time - It may be bad enough to watch as one of those movies 'so bad it's good'? - the little girl says 'Said the white rabbit' about 150 times which can be fun to echo back at your dad or film history instructor who made you watch this."
50,Alice,10,22 November 2006,"Alice, my most inspiring film of all","I actually first watched Alice when it was on the BBC at the age of 8. It mesmerized me then and it still does today. Svankmajer's choice of syntagms for characters, props, settings and sounds is beautiful. The film has an aesthetic quality beyond any other and the skills of a filmmaker and animator are quite clear. What always fascinates me with Svankmajer's work is the ability to animate anything, from dolls to socks to pencil sharpeners it is done and to brilliant effect. The combination of live action with stop animation is a fantastic quality of his films and is perfectly executed in Alice. I have read peoples dislike for the narrating mouth which appears but I feel this simply adds greater surrealism and style to to a film that already contains stunning imagery. If your looking for an entropic and surreal experience your watching the right film.A fantastic depiction of Lewis Carroll's story by a true auteur."
51,Alice,7,9 August 2006,Another Visually Interesting Film From Jan Svankmajer...,"First off - ALICE is actually a strinkingly interesting film visually, and some people will (justifiably) like it much more than I did. I personally don't really care so much about the ALICE IN WONDERLAND tale, as I haven't read it in probably 20 years and therefore don't remember it very well - I really only picked ALICE up after seeing LITTLE OTIK, liking it, and wanting to see something else from Svankmajer. It's definitely visually stunning interpretation of the ALICE story - it's just a story that I'm personally not all that interested in.ALICE is the story of a young girl who follows a rabbit around a strange ""alternate universe"" and has run-ins with several strange characters and environs along the way...Svankmajer's film is told in narrative, live-action, and stop-motion animation, which makes for a heady blend of styles that works perfectly for the film. Consistent with Carol's story, ALICE has a dark undertone that off-sets some of the ""childish"" qualities of the story. Svankmajer's use of stop-motion animation and other set-pieces is well-done and artful. The only real reason that I didn't rate the film higher, is that after a while, it all became a bit tedious and I was ready for it to be over. Experimental/Art-house film lovers, or those that REALLY enjoy films like VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS or THE COMPANY OF WOLVES and other such ""grown-up"" fairy-tale films will probably jizz over this one, and granted - it is a VERY cool film for what it is - but it really isn't the type of thing that interests me all that much...but there's no denying that Svankmajer is an interesting and original director and I'd recommend ALICE in order to make up your own mind about it."
52,Alice,10,5 January 2004,The best rendition yet!,"This movie is spectacular.  But just like those tarts, it's for acquired tastes.  I like how the royalty are cards, and how the rabbit eats sawdust. It's like a whimsical little journey, which I admit can be a little long but worth while.  A good watch 10/10"
53,Alice,10,5 September 2003,great piece of art,"This is a great movie, but it's not for everyone. Svankmajer's works have their own little dark sides and here the material itself is creepy; it's perfect for Svankmajer and he does his magic again. Most people (especially American viewers or Hollywood generation of any nationality) may find it boring; but I would recommend anyone to watch it.What I particularly wonder on the other hand is that why on erath the only negative comment is put on the main page while there are lots of positives. It doesn't make sense."
54,Alice,6,6 November 2010,Meh. Creative but whatever.,In the initial minutes of Jan Svankmajer's Alice one assume they're installed for a minimal and meta 4:3 version of the classic Alice through the Looking Glass story shot on video. There is very little dialogue and when the spoken word does appear it's mostly from a close up of a girl's lips narrating the story. The quality and texture of the stop motion animation is of a Gumby standard and the entrance to the Wonderland is as minimal as the on screen action. I wonder if the film is simply misconstrued as being intentionally surrealistic (Milos Forman said this film was Disney + Bunuel on the DVD cover.) when Svankmaker could have wanted to make a more elaborate version of Alice and was simply forced to adopt a minimalist style due to the technological and budgetary limitations. The film spends its first forty minutes working out the animosity between Alice and the White Rabbit. I imagine children will enjoy these sequences if their attention span can handle the silent art film pacing. Alice actually enters into the Wonderland around an hour into the film itself and it's at this point where the film deviates from the original story to indulge in Kafka-esquire surrealism with cockroaches and sock worms and other bizarre interests of the film maker. Watching the segment with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare I start to feel that I would have appreciated this film more if I were an adolescent - I fail to see much groundbreaking about this rendition of the Lewis Carroll story as it is still targeted and tailored towards those in their teenage years. There's a curiosity in seeing how the film will adopt the other Wonderland characters in this minimalist DIY style but very little outside of this interest will lure the viewer into watching this film often.
55,Alice,9,6 September 2007,The greatest Alice adaptation yet made,"This movie is near perfect.Plain and simple: if you are a fan of ALICE IN WONDERLAND (or ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS), you should purchase this film immediately.You will definitely enjoy it.This is the only adaptation of ALICE in any form that is mind-boggling, FRIGHTENING, strange, eerie, and a true head-trip (you know: as is the book). Director Jan has certainly had a hit-and- miss career, but this is probably his best film and one to judge him as a true master of cinema.Even if you are not a fan of LC (is that possible?), you will enjoy this film. I can't imagine anyone having trouble with it, unless"
56,Alice,3,31 May 2013,More Nightmareland than Wonderland,"The original Alice in Wonderland story was a little odd but, within the context of a dream, ultimately excusable. The director/writer of the film must have found the story too ordinary, as he opts for a more bizarre and occasionally creepy re-imagining. The adaptation is pretty loose in relation to the original story and omits several major characters (most noticeably the Cheshire Cat, although he could have been invisible the whole time....) although many of the key plot points remain.However, the kicker is that most of the artistic elements aren't even all that memorable, let alone good. The best one is the rabbit coming to life in the beginning but then it's mostly so-so until a very creepy take on the tea party. Some is just weird for the sake of weird, which doesn't necessarily make for a good film.The worst part is that the film is fairly dull and the repeated effect of seeing Alice talk for the other characters gets annoying fast. As such, the film may be worth watching just to see how much of it you can stand before switching it off."
57,Alice,9,14 March 2009,Alice Becomes More Surreal,"After having Jan Svankmajer's name under my radar for a while now, I decided I should get into his work through Alice. Lewis Carroll's novels are two of my favorites, so it seemed like the right place to start. How right I was! Svankmajer's Alice is a loose adaptation of Carroll's novels, revealing a surrealist sensibility. Carroll, for all his nonsense and wordplay and paradoxes, was a mathematician, steeped in logic and reason. More amazing than the apparent disorder of the novels, is how much sense they make.Now this movie revels in unsettling and baffling the viewer. The filmmaker isn't interested in making much sense, although there is a linear plot. He just uses the novel's characters and situations to create amazing sequences filled with mystery and dread.In this world people can enter new rooms through open drawers, socks and stakes come to life, skeleton/animal hybrids torment young Alice, and the white rabbit eats sawdust. The filmmaker doesn't pretend this is all a fiction. The white rabbit is clearly a stuffed doll, the caterpillar is a sock, the Queen of Hearts is clearly a giant card, crude (wonderful!) stop-animation abounds. The art direction is incredible, a sense of decay pervades the entire set.This movie is a nice companion piece to Carroll's original novels. Its surreal imagery will delight anyone who enjoys the weird, the dream-like and mysterious."
58,Alice,7,30 December 2008,"ALICE (Jan Svankmajer, 1988) ***","This is possibly the best-regarded of the myriad film versions of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice In Wonderland"", a relatively recent undertaking but a distinctly individualistic one by famed Czech animator/puppeteer Svankmajer (and which actually served as my introduction to his work). Knowing of its reputation, I had long desired to watch the film; however, having done so, I can't help feeling slightly let down  not because it's not as good as I expected, or as weird as I had been led to believe but, rather, because of the liberties it takes with Carroll's original.God knows there are enough bizarre characters, situations and dialogue in the perennial children's classic (popularized by previous film and TV adaptations, both live-action and animated); however, Svankmajer opts to drop many of these (we're left with an awful lot of the White Rabbit, The Frog, The Fish, The Duchess and the Baby-turned-Pig, the members of the eccentric Tea Party, the Croquet game, etc.) for his own creations. It's not so much that I'm a purist where such things are concerned but, to me, what novelties we get in this version are not only unnecessary (though they sure make for some arresting, to say nothing of far from kiddie, visuals and occasionally amusing  such as the fact that the White Rabbit's interior consists of sawdust which it also eats[!] or The Mouse building a fire and setting up tent on Alice's scalp) but, frankly, no match for what Carroll himself had envisaged to begin with. Consequently, the author's absurdist but essentially innocent viewpoint doesn't jell with the film-maker's outbursts of savage surrealism  so that one has a hard time believing at the end that it was all a little girl's fantasy! With this in mind, the heroine here is perhaps the only one I've seen who's anywhere near the right age for the character (incidentally, Alice is replaced by a doll when she shrinks in size!); even so, Svankmajer's decision to have her provide constant narration  often of the most elementary kind, thus rendering it somewhat monotonous  is baffling to say the least!"
59,Alice,8,3 October 2008,Taxidermy puppet show!,"'Neco z Alenky' is a film I've been curious about for years, but, never got the chance to see until today. Now that I have seen it all I can say is that this is something special. I prepared myself to be shocked or disturbed (because of what I'd heard about it) and it ended up being an unexplainable experience. It was trippy, funny, imaginative, baffling and bizzar. I found myself really captivated all the way till the end.The girl that plays Alice did well I thought. She fit what the story demanded and reacted exactly as any child would in this bizzar wonderland.The creatures where fantastic. Some of them where morbid, but, everything in this film is done with a little bit of humor and absurdity, so it didn't bother me really. Children have dark sides too and I think the film captures the angry imaginings of a child acting out. The unraveling of the Alice and Wonderland story was very original and gives you the pleasure (or terror) of seeing this world in a completely new way. It also manages to cover most of the story from the book.Truly, the only thing that bothered me was the narration continuously explaining the obvious.In the end it full heartedly captured my imagination and left me wanting to see it again.8/10 stars"
60,Alice,8,19 April 2008,would be a masterwork of pure fantasy cinema except for a repetitive flaw (and a minor complaint),"Jan Svankmajer is certainly one of the most imaginative minds to ever touch stop-motion animation. He puts his mark with such a distinctive presence, with such a fever-dream aspect of nightmares of the child-like and bizarre, that he can certainly have the 'one-of-a-kind' stamp on his lapel. Alice is an example of his virtuosity and ingenuity, even if, sad to say, it's not overall a great film. It definitely reaches for greatness, the kind which only a select few who go into animation and surrealistic film-making can hope to achieve. His take on Alice in Wonderland is warped and lacking the kind of verbal punch of the original Disney cartoon. But at its best it's a lot like a pure disturbingly poetic cinematic expression, like someone's own interpretation that goes off into many different fields visually while never straying from the intent of the source. In this case- and of course it's already on a silver platter- it's through the looking glass.Alice does what we know she'll do, which is to follow the white rabbit, who appears at first nailed to a piece of wood and then puts on his clothes (with some very chilling eyes and teeth like some demented doll), and then follows along through the various portals, growing big and shrinking small (in this case for the latter as a doll), and then finally on trial by the king and queen of hearts. This is all handled in a dazzling production design (sorry, got to use 'dazzling' for this one), where things feel cramped and ethereal and always, always strange and coming out of some organic method or something almost un-dead (i.e. the skeleton creatures coming out of the eggs). It's both very funny and also very frightening, and if you watch as a child it's about as unsettling as anything imaginable in stop-motion. This is the days before CGI; everything is build and molded to exact construction.The only big problems for me were in a method of narrative devices Svankmajer chose and omitting a crucial character. For the former, every time Alice thinks something or another character says something he cuts to an extreme close-up angle of Alice's lips (you know, Rocky Horror opening credits style) and Alice says ""said the white rabbit"" or ""thought Alice."" It's a major detraction from what should be seamless narrative; it doesn't help as well that on the most current DVD release in America there are no options for other languages or subtitles, and we're left with a very poorly dubbed *English* girl's voice. Had Svankmajer gone for broke and not had any character said a word (well, then again, ""why is a raven like a writing desk"" is the best line exchange in the text), it might have been a really brave step. On top of this, the Cheshire Cat, an iconic piece of the story, is regrettably missing, which not only would have been an ample opportunity for Svankmajer to up the ante on the surreal approach and horrific craftsman approach to the characters, but it would've given a beat to breathe between all the crazy action between Alice and the white rabbit.And yet, Alice remains 20 years later a near masterwork, a film brimming with invention and visual wit, and has at least a few images I'm sure might return to me out of nowhere in a dream."
61,Alice,10,6 July 2005,A surreal nightmare from one of the Czech Republic's most influential animators.,"Jan Svankmajer is an amazing director, often combining stop motion with real life actors. His films create a unique atmosphere, as we are drawn into his world. The story of ""Alice and Wonderland"" has been done to death, but no one has quite made it as interesting as Jan Svankmajer. ""Alice"" is very creepy with its child actress constantly pursued by a chattering rabbit, who keeps loosing his straw. There is also skeleton creatures that drive a carriage. When Alice becomes tiny, she turns into a frightening doll. Most memorable are the caterpillars made of socks. They squirm in and out of holes in the floor. In order to sleep, they have to sew there button eyes shut. Although ""Alice"" doesn't contain anything violent or offensive, it's very unsettling. Watch it, and you'll discover the strange world of Jan Svankmajer."
62,Alice,,29 January 2004,Alices Cinematic Problem...Uncracked.,"Since the heyday of film, Lewis Carroll's book ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" has captivated directors. From the humorously bad silent treatments (One by Thomas Edison's Film Company I might add) to Walt Disney's failure of a picture which still captivates audiences for its trippy animation. In the suituation of Alice, it is not faith to Carroll's writing which was done in the 70's drab, dull adaptation starring Peter Sellers, but its taking the directors interpretation and a slice of what Carroll's work is about. Jan Svankmajer has done exactly that. Lewis Carroll's book in a nutshell, is a deeply haunting book. Written in the time of a strict, closed minded philisophical and cultural generation, we chillingly call the Victorian Era. In a time of strict parenting, Alice is an innocent victim even in her fantasy land. Being threatend by decapitation, pshycological torture and down right meaness. While Jan Svankmajer takes bottles of disgusting things, antique play toys, taxidermist animals and other odd things to animate with, he had indeed made the perfect Alice that the world deserves. 10 out of 10, Watch it, Please!"
63,Alice,6,27 August 1999,A blend of live and action and stop motion animation that will give you nightmares!,"If you believe that the Alice in Wonderland fable is a delightful children's story and you want to CONTINUE to believe that then you really should not see this Czechoslavakian film.This is Alice when she ate too much of those mushrooms the caterpillar was pushing.This is a very, VERY dark version of the Alice story where the characters bleed often; but it is only sawdust.  Where there is a preoccupation with sharp objects -- many many scissors, broken glass, pins and saws.Though this film does remain faithful to the ""Alice"" story it is as far removed from it as Carroll's story is from reality.Carroll's lush garden becomes a sterile field.  Alice's fall through the rabbit hole is a ride in a creaky and dirty elevator; and the imagery does not stop there.Kristyna Kohoutova, who plays the title role and is the only ""real"" person in this film, is doll-like and fragile (when Alice becomes small an actual doll is used).  I must admit that I wonder what filming this did to her -- this is nightmarish and frightening and she was only a child.  But other child actors have played such horrific roles and not been permanently marked -- or have they?I would recommend this film -- but prepare to forget all your notions of a lovely little fairy tale."
64,Alice,9,6 September 2000,The dark side of Alice in Wonderland.,"Svankmager`s little known masterpiece is a refreshing take on the extremely influential Alice in Wonderland story.  Almost staying literally within Carroll`s tale, Svankmager does not reinvent Alice so much as give us another dimension to the story.  Gone is the sickly sweet Disney-like telling of the story, and in its place the rather creepy dimension of Carroll`s genius.  We are reminded just how dark a story this is.  A girl goes into a hole in the ground and faces unsympathetic animal-like creatures, does hallucinogenic mushrooms (which Svankmager changes to rather repulsive looking cookies), and faces judgement from a cruelly violent inquisitor.Somehow Svankmager is able to bring all this inherent creepyness back to the surface where it has been mostly hidden from view.  The result is a much more interesting story."
65,Alice,8,3 February 2000,The cosy nursery as terrifying and threatening as it always was.,"Although Disney's 1951 ALICE IN WONDERLAND comes superbly close, this is probably the definitive visualisation of Lewis Carroll's masterpiece.  It may not be as entertaining or immediately impressive as its predecessor, but unhindered by Hollywood convention, restrictions for children, or the expectations of fidelity, Svankmajer has conducted an astonishing archaeological trawl of Carroll's underlying meanings, making almost repellently tactile the book's more philosophical implications.The book is crammed with abiding joys, but two especially are noteworthy. First is its attack on everything representing complacent Victorian society - its monumental solidity; its faith in progress through science, experiment, classification; the concomitant classifying of ordered society according to class, gender etc.; the manifestation of this order through culture.Carroll countered this by making everything solid unstable; by making progress circular and self-defeating, classification amorphous and culture absurd.  What makes this attack enduring today, and is the book's second great achievement, is its basis in the anxious mind of a prepubescent girl, herself a site of cultural expectations, on the verge of wrenching sexual change, as well as the oppressive place in society she will be forced to adopt.Svankmajer captures all this brilliantly.  The film starts with a river flowing to the left and the camera panning to the right, already disrupting the 'natural', ordered run of things.  Alice sits on the bank with her sister, bored, throwing stones into the river, prey to bugs, smacked by her unseen sibling when she examines her book, forbidden from tasting the fruits of knowledge.Alice repeats this scene in her bedroom, throwing stones in a cup. Svankmajer, unlike Carroll, moves the action indoors - this emphasises the book's movement: from the harmonious Victorian image of a pretty girl to the traumatised metamorphoses inside her head; but, like that pan against the river, it also reveals an opposite movement, showing that the troubles of this mind extend to the underlying chaos of a society unable to sustain its progressive vision of itself.ALICE's live action becomes increasingly intruded by animation, showing the lack of stable reality to come, but also the fundamental lack of stable reality in this society.  In many ways, Alice's room is like that of any young Victorian girl, laden with bric-a-brac, toys, gadgets, maps, pictures, animals, games.  But it is as if all this accumulation has finally imploded, leaving the bricolage of an unhinged mind, and a metamorphosing body whose chrysalis-like puberty is linked to insect life.  One picture shows a rabbit about to be eaten by a wolf.  The room is shrouded in dank darkness.  There is no order or enlightenment here, only fragmentation, confusion and decay.The plot proper begins with her pet rabbit coming to life, worrying about the time, a particularly Victorian obsession.  Alice follows this rabbit over a rocky wasteland until he gets into a strikingly Surreal writing cabinet.  She is unable to get in by 'normal' means, and when she breaks it open, finds a mess of set-squares and compasses, one of which pricks her finger.  She follows a trail of geometric equipment until she comes across the rabbit eating in a disgustingly squalid space, as his own body is decomposing.  When he leaves through the desk he eats on, she again is unable to follow.  Her fall down the hole is here achieved by a rickety old lift, as she passes cupboard upon cupboard of abandoned toys. 
This is all Channel 4 would show us - I'm going to have to look up the rest of it now.  But there is so much in this first part - about the problematics of unknowingly exploring one's sexuality; about the 'reality' of our surroundings; and about the double-edged failure of science.  Alice becomes the story teller by reading out all the dialogue, but this power is undermined by her bodily fragmentation - she's all lips; further compounded by the fact that her words are English nonsense translated into Czech (and dubbed back into English again).Most remarkable of all is how Alice's journey resembles nothing more than a trip to Eastern Europe (this Czechoslovakian film was made just before the collapse of Communism), where everything is abandoned, barely working, damp, dark, derelict, bug-infested, creaky and concealing unthinkable horrors. Svankmajer's best tribute to Carroll is to keep the psychological permeability of Alice's quest rooted in a specifically social critique."
66,Alice,1,12 July 2016,the worst film of all time,"If you are a fan of random, loud, annoying noises and pictures; solely intended to be an eye/ear sore, then this is the film for you. I used to have very vivid, haunting, random dreams of shapes and noises when I was a child that used to haunt me at night. This film is very similar to those dreams.You would have to be another level of pretentious to give this film a positive rating, or refer to it as ""art""It is nonsense for the sake of nonsense. The sole intention of this film is to wind people up. I think Jan Svankmajer did this film for a laugh to see what he could get away with, knowing full well that some so called ""film critics"" would still give it rave reviews, however skin crawlingly pointlessIf I could stop one person from watching this film with this review I feel that I would have made the world a slightly better placeThe only possible use for this movie would be for torture. This is far more psychologically harmful than waterboardingIt angers me that this film exists and the fact that it won an award makes me sick"
67,Alice,9,21 July 2014,"Alice in Wonderland, another dimension (contains spoiler)","If we remember that Lewis Carroll(Charles Dodgson)was a pedophile, it adds another dimension to his book and to this movie. He was obsessed with little girls. He borrowed them from their mothers who probably did not know that he was taking photographs of them nearly nude. If literary Alice's childhood featured sexual abuse, it would explain s great deal about her nightmares. Victorian children were severely repressed, required to be seen but not heard. Alice in the movie is in effect a life-size doll who goes from being normal size to tiny and then to very large. But becoming larger does not bestow on Alice any power to control the bizarre events in her dream. Except for demolishing poor Bill the lizard (phallic symbol), she is helpless until the very end when she wakes up before the Red Queen can cut off her head. In the book at the very end Alice says defiantly to the royal court, ""You're nothing but a pack of cards!"""
68,Alice,2,9 September 2013,"""I have never seen such a drug-induced nightmare of a film that is also dull"" said WakenPayne","If anyone wants to show their kids a version of Alice In Wonderland... skip this one. Most likely your kids will be scared of all the characters in this movie aside from Alice. I mean it has imagery so creepy for a family film that Son Of The Mask looks normal. You'll hear a lot about this later on. But I don't really mind drug induced nightmares of film (such as Xtro and Troll) but this takes away my interest 20 minutes before the movie is over.So what is the plot? Contrary to the book Alice travels to the unsettling creepy-as-f#ck stop-motion hell known as Wonderland. When you think Wonderland do you think of sawdust-rabbit insides being eaten, sock caterpillars that sew their own eyes shut, eggs that hatch skulls, alive raw meat, people setting campfires on Alice's giant head and bread that grows nails? If you don't then you're weird.Now here comes the reason of why I think it's dull, there isn't really a plot to this thing. It focuses more on trying to establish tone than anything else and doesn't really go beyond that. There is a tone to this thing but it's just there. If I were to compare a beloved children's book that got a darker treatment, Return To Oz did have quite a dark tone, but it was there to support the story. Here it's more like they're wasting time establishing this tone and doing nothing.One more complaint ""said WakenPayne"". I just said what my complaint was. This movie is like a book because the only person talking is Alice. Not that bad of a complaint? How about her telling who said the line when they CLEARLY SHOW WHO IS SAYING THE LINE OF DIALOGUE. If I wanted to read a book, I would read a book. I don't watch a movie for no story and the protagonist saying who said what.So what is my final verdict. If you are a fan of experimental art-house movies that are only there to turn away from a linear storyline and barely do anything (such as French New Wave films and Persona) then this is for you. It does a few things right like it does establish it's tone really well of being a dark adaptation and the stop-motion is okay. It is not a movie for children (whether that is intentional or not is left for debate) but if you like art-house then this is worth it."
69,Alice,,29 July 2011,Best adaption of Alice and Wonderland EVER!,"I love this movie. It is just pure awesome. The animation is astounding, the atmosphere is amazing, and there is a single boring second. Yes, this is an art film. But not the kind of black and white, 3 hour borefest made up of people with berets atop their head and cigars in their mouths, talking about life. No, this movie is really good entertainment. I saw it when I was little, and I loved it. I re watched it, and I loved it even more. Of course, I wouldn't suggest showing it to especially young children, unless they really like film and are prepared for a dark movie. For instance, I watched many controversial horror films, (Psycho, The Excorsist) at a young age and was not frightened. So, if you do have a child who is not easily frightened, then by all means let him/her watch it. I cannot recommend this movie more, and I suggest you go out and see it immediately."
70,Alice,9,10 April 2011,oddly compelling,"My point of reference for Jan Svankmajer's ""Alice"" is Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"" (Svankmajer in general and his ""Alice"" in particular are known to have significantly influenced Gilliam). Although the images in Svankmajer's ""Alice"" are definitely weirder, darker, and more disturbing than virtually any other ""Alice"" film, they're _not_ quite as weird, dark, and disturbing as the ones in Tideland. I at least never recoiled in shock or horror from the images in ""Alice"" ...although I strongly suspect that quite a few others will.The stop-motion animation is outstanding. Having a doll climb a ladder, then slide down some furniture and fall down on the floor, is something that I expected to look a little stagy with typical stop-motion animation. Instead having those images be totally believable -to the point of watching for bruises and sprained ankles- amazed me.The ""sound effects"" (foley) are trademark Svankmajer: hyper-realistic and quite detailed and very loud. The sound effects are virtually continuous for the entire film. We hear exactly what Alice hears; the sound track never switches to the next scene ahead of the images.One trope that's used throughout is extreme closeups of Alice's moving lips as she speaks or thinks. The effect _might_ be stunning with the original audio and subtitles--I simply don't know ...because that's not available. All that's available is an English dubbed soundtrack. (Although I watched a Netflix CD, even searches of YouTube and non-English searches via international eBay or Google turned up only one reference to a possible release of the original audio, a proposed Blu-Ray that appears not to have actually happened, at least not as of April 2011.) Although the dubbing English girl sounds about the right age and temperament, the English sounds simply don't match up with the moving lips images. This is very disconcerting, making the lips trope little more than an annoyance.Svankmajer's ""Wonderland"" is entirely interiors. While warped and not quite realistic, it's a recognizable combination of an abandoned barn and a tenement house ...pre WWII. I don't think anything really looks like that these days.Somehow what initially appeared to me to be just a series of discontinuous bizarre images cohered into a single film experience. I still can't explain why I remained engrossed or where the feeling of continuity came from or how I was left with a single overall emotional impression. But I was."
71,Alice,10,29 March 2009,Impressive,"I saw this 1988 version of Alice in Wonderland on YouTube and, to be honest with you, I was quite impressed with it.As an Alice in Wonderland adaptation, I thought it was a work of pure genius. I 100% thought that Jan Svankmajer captured the surrealism of the original Lewis Carroll book. Everything about this film was just sick and twisted, as a fan of the book myself. It also followed most of the events of the book, but it did leave out the Mock Turtle and Gryphon bit of the story.Although I am not really a fan of stop-motion animation (I'm more a 2D animation fan) and I also like the Disney flick, I was so impressed with this version of Alice in Wonderland. I believe the girl who played Alice was great at the part.If you want to watch a great example of Lewis Carroll's novel, you have come to the right film. As a fan of the books as well as Disney's film: I give it a 10 out of 10.Note: If you want to watch this movie, it says in the early bit of the film: ""This is a film made for children."" Don't let that fool you. Do not let your children watch this as they will be terrified by what is going on in this movie."
72,Alice,7,23 August 2008,What it would look like if Hieronymous Bosch could have made films---this is NOT a film for little kids!,"I agree with the other reviewers who said this was an incredibly creepy and disturbing film--one you should NOT let younger viewers see. Instead of the cute animated Alice like you may have seen in Disney's ALICE IN WONDERLAND, this one uses stop-motion for animation AND the characters are very, very weird.The White Rabbit begins the film as a stuffed dead rabbit in a display case. Suddenly, it tears itself free and begins running about--as old sawdust (what they stuffed old anatomical specimens with in the old days) comes pouring out during the course of the film. If that isn't enough, later malevolent skeletal animals with bizarre bodies and horrible bug-eyes appeared and began attacking her--and it isn't surprising that Alice is afraid--heck, I was feeling a bit afraid! Other demonic-like images appear--amazingly weird playing cards as well as the decapitation of the March Hare and Mad Hatter!! In many ways, this film looked inspired by the 16th century Dutch painter, Bosch--who was famous for paintings of Hell--complete with demons and creatures much like you'd see in this film.While in general the stop-motion animation is rather jerky and poor, the imagery and weirdness make it very watchable---plus I love the imaginative sets that make up for the cheesy movement. However, one thing I could not get used to and hated was the way the little girl narrated and always said phrases like ""...said the White Rabbit"" or whatever creature she was narrating for in the film as well as closeups of her lips as she said it. It was highly repetitive and combined with the fact that the film was dubbed and not subtitled (which I greatly prefer), it was not needed and distracted the viewer. In fact, the girl was the voice for EVERY character--a poor decision in retrospect.Overall, you've gotta respect this film for being so different and for taking so long to make. However, it's super-creepy and not particularly pleasant, so you be the judge as to whether or not to take a chance with this mondo-bizarro flick."
73,Alice,10,18 December 2007,Brilliant,"I cant believe I have finally found this film. I watched it when I was a little girl and I loved it. I've been trying to find it ever since and now thanks to some of the reviews I've read from people who have watched this film, I've found it. Now that I've found it I will be buying it and keeping it for ever.I think its by far the best version of Alice In Wonderland I have ever seen. I recommend that you watch it and I bet you feel the same way about it as me. So go on what are you waiting for! Your missing out by not watching this film."
74,Alice,7,3 December 2007,Morbid stop motion animation,"Jan Svankmajer's ALICE is a retelling of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and though it is a vivid, disturbing and rather ugly retelling, it is unique and creative enough to get an above average rating. While not for kids, the film has zero blood, curses, sex or nudity, but is abundant with such a dark and maddening disposition, that young children would inevitably get nightmares.Wonderland is long gone this time around, and in its place, a dilapidated, forsaken house filled with all manner of bizarre and unpleasant creatures; the majority of them composed of animal skeletons and stained linen. ALICE never really seems in harm's way, but a foreboding presence is constant, as a way out seems impossible.The characters are there, though definitely not as you may remember them: the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the caterpillar...each one is shown to ill and eerie effect, making their presence known with jerky movements and disgusting eating habits by voraciously licking up tea or shoveling saw dust into their mouths.I've seen FOOD and LITTLE OTIK, and though ALICE is still recommendable, for all its weirdness and aforementioned dark nature, it remains a film to be loved or hated. The nonstop creativity on display saves this film, as does its sinister world, but annoying decisions by Svankmajer almost sink ALICE. The addition of a visual narrative(""Says the white rabbit"") gets old fast and never works, and there are a few sequences that run a little long, ex: the March Hare and Mad Hatter winding and buttering their watches.If you wish to see a really strange version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, look no further."
75,Alice,,31 December 2006,Alice,"This is a near-perfect version of Lewis Carroll's tale about the girl whom he loved. I have a particular interest in Carroll, as I lived close to his college rooms at university, and Alice Liddell herself moved (and lived out much of her life) about half a mile from where I live in west Kent. Alice was the daughter of Henry Liddell, dean of Christ Church, Oxford (a great post in church and university) and co-editor of Liddell and Scott's ""Greek Lexicon"", still very much in use today (a wag put it unkindly, 'Two men wrote a lexicon,/ Liddell and Scott./ Scott wrote the lexicon,/ Liddell did not.' Robert Scott was master of Balliol College, Oxford and later dean of Rochester).The use of stop-animation perhaps impedes the fluidity of the story, and on occasion it is at risk of becoming tedious (but that is perhaps part of the point of the Mad Hatter's Tea Party - moreover, Carroll was not afraid of repetition, as in ""The Hunting of the Snark"": 'Just the thing said the Snark,/ I have said it once, that alone should encourage the crew./ Just the thing said the Snark,/ I have said it twice,/ What I tell you two times is true.').In ""Alice"" Jan Svankmajer continues his outstanding run of animated works: ""Dimensions of Dialogue"", ""Punch and Judy"", ""Down to the Cellar"" and ""Jabberwocky"" (also by Carroll). There are a few suggestions that this Alice is set somewhere in Mitteleuropa, and not in the deanery at Christ Church, but this in no way detracts from the story or the message (insofar as there is one). Carroll (and Svankmajer) had a genuine feeling for the psychology of children - Carroll because of his psychological infantilism - also manifested in misplaced mathematical obsessions; Svankmajer because of his keen understanding of the nightmare as the transposition of a childhood experience into the thought world of the adult.After a while you realise that there is no music, but this accentuates the weirdness of the film, and heightens the concentration of the viewer. The very seriousness, the austerity of the presentation heightens its dream-like quality. A wonderful achievement by Svankmajer, the photographer Svatopluk Maly and editor Marie Zemanova. Watch out too for the bewigged frog footman, with his enormous, phallic, tongue."
76,Alice,8,19 November 2006,Come and follow that dastardly late white rabbit.,"A young little girl named Alice, follows a stuffed rabbit that breaks out of its glass cage and enters through a desk draw to reach Wonderland. This childhood journey she succumbs to becomes a real bizarre and at times quite dangerous experience. This is all before she faces her trail in front of the King and Queen of Hearts.Let make take you on a weird and not-so-wonderful look into the dark fantasy life of childhood. Well, really just be prepared to be flabbergasted at Czech animator Jan Svankmajer's dreamlike and uniquely live / animated art-house version of Lewis Carroll's classic tale ""Alice in Wonderland"". Is it the best adaptation? Well, I like to think so.This experimental production used a mixture of media techniques with great vision and crisp execution. You can just imagination the pain that would've gone into this feature to get it up and running. Svankmajer illustrates his own distinctive touch to the vivid tale, where this curiously enigmatic universe seduces and swallows us up. Other than it's mind-boggling visuals, what makes this version stand out from the rest is that it got a disturbingly warped undertone in many of its picturesque frames. Where dreams can turn nightmarish in a matter of seconds. Also a nice sense of wry humour (and even slapstick) doesn't go astray and only enhances the oddness of it all. While, the story's journey and characters are familiar, we're still unhinged by a bonbon of surreal ideas and outlandish imagery of this strikingly inventive world.A very recognizable feature that I noticed, was there wasn't any music cues throughout the flick (well other than in the closing credits), but Svankmajer's decides to use natural sounds of the actions to invoke the mood of what's happening on screen. Even the background features and overall setting paints plenty of separate stories and adds strangely to the disturbing air with its saturated colour scheme and astonishing decor. The set-designs, puppets and animation all are sharply done with personality and truly are eye-catching (that goes for the white rabbit and Mad Hatter). I know for some the pacing could get rather monotonous and true it's far from electrifying. Blame it on the White Rabbit who constantly complains about being late, but if he didn't spend too much time looking at his watch. I'm sure time would've gone fast and he would be at his destination by now.Practical story telling doesn't take shape and dry dialogues are very little. The dialogue is voiced from Alice (or we just see a close-up her red lips in frame) in narration format. Kristyna Kohoutova is quite sincere and airy in her performance of Alice and Camilla Power who was the voice, provided that childhood innocence mixed in with growing enthusiasm and mischievous. The voice-over after awhile can get a bit overbearing and it does seem to lose steam just before the ending with the action getting a bit wearisome, but this beautiful craftsmanship and the blinding visionary had me totally wrapped that I could forgive its shortcomings.Svankmajer's work is a rather open, notable spin on an all-loved classic tale. This vision captures the child at heart and blends that with the wickedly grim imagination that lies under the surface."
77,Alice,6,10 December 2004,A Wondrous Mis-interpretation,"My qualms with this adaptation are in what was chosen to be emphasised and what was simply hinted at instead. Visually this is one of Svankmajer's most important works; his interpretive props and the way in which he establishes his signature scenarios make this film worthwhile. But as an Alice interpretation, it is sub-par.It may have been simply a springboard into a visual territory he wanted to explore (the underworld, fantasy, talking animals), but Alice was never meant to be so bleak, nor was fear supposed to be the dominating emotion. Rather the story is filled with wonder and innocence.3 out of 5 - Some strong elements"
78,Alice,8,2 May 2004,Alice Bizarre,"This ""Alice in Wonderland"" performed by strange-looking puppets and a beautiful little girl (Kristyna Kohoutová) is Czech animation at its weirdest, as bizarre as it is highly imaginative. It follows the traditional storyline of the little girl who follows a rabbit and encounters a series of strange characters, until she meets the Queen of Hearts. As Neil Jordan's ""The Company of Wolves"", the erotic elements in Jan vankmajer's (and Lewis Carroll's) ""Alice"" are uninhibited and unmistakable, as in the highly phallic sequence when Alice meets the caterpillar in a room where male socks pop in and out of holes on the floor, and they try to rob Alice's stockings. Not as wildly crazy as vankmajer's ""Faust"", but certainly another film more appropriate for adult audiences."
79,Alice,,25 November 2003,A Bizarre Adventure!,"This variation of Alice in Wonderland, directed by the Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, is probably the most bizarre version of Lewis Carroll's work ever before seen, a blend of live action and stop motion animation.Alice (the only live action character) follows a stuffed White Rabbit into a drawer and enters a rather haunting labyrinth of cluttered rooms and dank hallways, populated by curiouser and curiouser versions of Carroll's classic characters, including a talking sock Caterpillar and a marionette Mad Hatter.The text is very faithful to Carroll's book, but the visuals are rather nightmarish and only suitable for children if they have a strong stomach for scary images. Kristyna Kohoutova, however, is absolutely wonderful as Alice, portraying her with the right charm, the right energy, and the right curiosity, almost as if the Alice of the book has jumped off the pages into this movie. Camilla Power, who dubs the voice for the English version, does an equally good job.A bizarre world and a unique vision for Alice fans. Just knock off any preconceived ideas about what Alice in Wonderland should be."
