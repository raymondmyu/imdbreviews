0,Drums Along the Mohawk,,28 April 2004,An Exception To a Rule About American History Films,"It is a strange truism about films concerning American History. While some of those films dealing with the Civil War are great (""The General"", ""Gone With The Wind"") or highly respectable (""The Raid"", ""Gettysburg"", ""Glory""), this is less true about films about the American Revolution. It's a sad or mediocre commentary. D.W.Griffith's first great feature length film was the controversial - pro K.K.K film: ""The Birth OF A Nation"". No matter how you hate the film's racism, it's innovation make it a film landmark. But his attempt at a Revolution film, America, was a flop. Just see the titles: ""America"", ""The Howards Of Virginia"", ""The Devil's Desciple"" (slightly better due to its star cast, especially Olivier as ""Gentleman Johnny"" Burgoyne), ""John Paul Jones"", ""Lafayette"", ""Revolution"". There are two exceptions. The musical ""1776"" was a good film, and (despite some historical errors) told the story of the creation of the Declaration of Independence pretty well. This film is the other. It is the only film by John Ford set in the American Revolution (he was more at home in the Indian Wars of the 1870s). It is in glorious color for a 1939 film. It has a dandy cast from Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert as the young married couple, to Edna Mae Oliver, Ward Bond, Arthur Shields, and John Carridine (except that his motivation as a Tory is never developed - possibly his scenes were cut in the editing).Perhaps it was the source. Walter D. Edmonds is a forgotten writer today, but when I was growing up in the 1960s his novels, ""Drums Along The Mohawk"" and ""Chad Hanna"", were still published and read. Interestingly Henry Fonda was also in the film version of that latter novel. Edwards was a regional historical writer (which may explain his contemporary oblivion). All his novels are set in upstate New York, ""Chad Hanna"" being set in the 1830s. ""Drums Along The Mohawk deals with the warfare between settlers in Western New York and the Six Nations of the Iroquois Indians, the latter allied with Tories. It is a grueling warfare - culminating in the battle of Oriskany, where American troops literally slugged it out in forest fighting with the Indians. Commanded by General Nicholas Herkimer (Ralph Imhof in the film)the Americans barely won the battle. Herkimer died of his wounds a few days later (movingly captured in the movie). He is honored today by a county upstate named for him. These events occurred in 1777, and the film seems to end in 1779. It ends with the settlers of the Mohawk River Valley triumphing over the Tories and Indians. What is not shown is what really crushed the Indians - Washington sent General John Sullivan into the area, and in a foreshadowing of the scorched earth policies of General William Tecumseh Sherman, Sullivan burned the Iroquois villages to the ground. It is not a pretty story now, but in that period Sullivan was considered a national hero. Ford does not even touch on that aspect. Probably just as well. But what he does show is first rate Ford, and we are all grateful for that."
1,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,25 August 2006,"An engrossing Revolutionary War story from John Ford, with many of his strengths and some of his weaknesses","When Lana Martin (Claudette Colbert) arrives by wagon with her new husband, Gil (Henry Fonda), to Mohawk Valley and his homestead, she isn't prepared for what she sees. The time is just before the Revolutionary War. The valley is beautiful and unspoiled, but the homestead is a one-room log cabin Gil has built, and the farm will need to be worked by the two of them. Lana has never seen an Indian, but in the course of the movie she's going to see a lot, and most won't be friendly. Drums Along the Mohawk is John Ford's curious but effective look at one aspect of the Revolutionary War. The story isn't about George Washington or the great battles. It's the story of what happens in this one, isolated valley in upstate New York. While there are Indian attacks and we can see the results of a battle or two, the story really is about Lana Martin and how she changed. We watch her and Gil build their farm, and we see it burnt to the ground when war comes to the valley. From a young woman in a big, frilly dress facing a life she had never imagined, by the end of the movie Lana is wearing a soldier's coat and is prepared to shoot down an attacker, which she does with hardly a blink. She sees Gil return from his first battle almost shell-shocked. We see her and Gil having to become hired hands when their farm is destroyed. We see her suffer a miscarriage. At the start of the movie, Gil was an honest, hard-working young man, almost naive at times. Now he and Lana are watching the birth of their new nation. They've both become...capable. ""Well,"" Gil says to her at the close, ""I reckon we'd better be getting' back to work. There's going' to be a heap to do from now on."" And we know he's talking about building a nation, not just a new farm. The movie is effective despite John Ford's long-time propensity for ham-handed humor, sentimental myth building and his indulgence in stereotypical portrayals of Indians as either child-like objects of amusement or animal-like objects of fear. What saves this story, as it saved many of Ford's films, is his great talent for cinematic story-telling. As corn-ball as some of the scenes in this movie are -- the short, chubby drunk or Gil's amazement that his wife is giving birth or the wise but child-like behavior of the Christian Indian chief -- we still are caught up in Gil's and Lana's story. Although the movie is particularly a paean to the women who had to struggle on, sometimes fighting, sometimes waiting, Ford gives the film an unusual unwarlike tone. The widow Mrs. McKennar, who took Gil and Lana in when their farm was destroyed, looks at Gil marching off to his first battle and thinks about her husband. ""Sometimes he'd wave. Ten to one he wasn't even seeing me. He was thinking about all those men, you see. All those men he went out to fight...to kill and be killed...blast his eyes, loving it."" One powerful scene has Gil and the other men back from the battle. They won but it didn't go well. Gil has collapsed, and as Lana tends to him he barely notices her. He just stares into the distance while he tells what happened when they were ambushed. ""I got down back of a log and aimed at a fellow. He leaped straight up in the air. Fell forward on his face. After that we just kept shooting as fast as we could load for I don't know how long. Adam Hartman came over beside me. His musket was broke. He had a spear. He kept grinning. I remember thinking, 'He's having a good time. He likes this.' Pretty soon he pointed off. I saw an Indian coming toward us, naked. I tried to load but it was too late. Adam stood up and braced his spear and the Indian came down. I never saw a fellow look so funny, so surprised. He just hung there, with his mouth open...lookin' at us, not sayin' a word. I had to shoot him, there wasn't anything else to do."" Ford pushes the buttons of duty, faith and patriotism. We've learned that war isn't the glorious struggle some make it out to be. Still, Ford shows us that fighting to protect our land, to protect our chance to build our farm and keep our children safe is proper. In 1939, that was a strong message. So was his theme of patriotism with which he closes the movie. At the fort in Mohawk Valley a company of regular soldiers arrives to tell the people that the war has been won, that Cornwallis has surrendered to Washington. They're carrying a flag. A churchman looks at it and says to the others, ""So that's our new flag, the thing we've been fighting for. Thirteen stripes for the colonies and thirteen stars in a circle for the Union."" And with that a couple of men take the flag and climb to the top of the church steeple, where they tie it down so that it waves in the wind. Ford knew how to punch home a point, alright. Fonda and Colbert were both fine actors. Fonda, in particular, brings, as usual, a strong sense of decency to his role. While I think he and Colbert make a slightly improbable pair (Colbert in all her roles, for me, seems to have a sly worldliness that makes her so good at sophisticated comedy), they work well together. The movie is really war from a woman's point of view, and Colbert brings it off."
2,Drums Along the Mohawk,,13 May 2001,Neglected gem! One of John Ford's finest films...,"1939 was a banner year for great films--and certainly one of them was ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" in gorgeous early technicolor about a period in history not often used as the subject of a major film. Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert are fine as a young couple in the years before the Revolutionary War settling in the backwoods of New York state. The hardships of pioneer life are made even tougher by the presence of Indians on the warpath, the only refuge being a nearby fort where men, women and children find some protection.Brilliantly photographed with lots of action scenes that bring the film vividly to life under John Ford's direction. John Carradine makes an excellent villain and Edna May Oliver gives another one of her priceless performances as an elderly widow who forms a strong attachment to the young couple. An unforgettable scene has Indians raiding her home while she refuses to budge from her bed even though they set fire to it. Scenes of Indian cruelty and torture are also present--but altogether a moving film well worth viewing to see what frontier life must have been like way back then. Sentimental at times--but also harsh and realistic. Most memorable scene: Fonda pursued by Indians for a long chase over woodlands, finally wearing out his pursuers who collapse from sheer exhaustion. Thrilling chase!"
3,Drums Along the Mohawk,,3 December 2001,A Ford Winner!,"There is a small *SPOILER* in the text below. This is one of my favorite John Ford films, although it usually is not ranked as one of his classics.  There is enough action, pathos and downright patriotism to satisfy Ford devotees. The standout in this film is Edna May Oliver as the feisty widow who won't give up her home to the invading Indians even though they are burning it down around her.  What a gal!!!!....her relationship with Ward Bond in this film is sweet and her final scenes will tear your heart.  The Indians are reminiscent of the characters in ""Northwest Passage"", in that they are savage beyond belief and some of the scenes are tough to take....such as the man tied to the burning wagon and Arthur Shields reaction to it.  Claudette Colbert is good as the wife and Henry Fonda was born to play this part, but it is the support cast that really fleshes out this film.  Poor John Carradine never gets to play a good guy and he is at his saturnine best here.  Look for John Ford's brother, Francis, in a small supporting role. It is a slice of American history and well worth seeing."
4,Drums Along the Mohawk,8,5 October 2006,Yeoman Farmers In the Mohawk Valley,"Drums Along the Mohawk is the story of newlyweds Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert and the trials they faced trying to make a life in the Mohawk River Valley during the Revolutionary War. The Upstate New York theater save for the key battle of Saratoga was one of the backwater areas of the American Revolution. Still it has a colorful history and it's the one area of the Revolution where the British made use of their allies among the Indians.Specifically the Iroquois who had supported the British against the French in the Seven Years War 20 year earlier. As a consequence of that support, the Indians were guaranteed no white settlement west of the Appalachian mountains. Saying that and enforcing that were two different propositions. Farmer pioneers as depicted by Fonda and Colbert were not about to be turned back by words in the Treaty of Paris. Of course the Indian side to it was never told on screen at that time in Hollywood.Still those were brave people who pioneered and the film is a tribute to them. The real person of Nicholas Herkimer and his brave death in the Battle of Oriskany is woven into this story. Herkimer is played by Roger Imhoff and he was the son of German settlers from Hanover. Remember George III was Duke of Hanover and lots of German settlers came to the colonies. Imhoff plays Herkimer with correct German accent and as the gallant hero he was.John Carradine plays Caldwell the one eyed Tory who leads the Iroquois, Why John Ford just didn't use the real name of Walter Butler for Carradine's character I couldn't say. Yet Caldwell is based on Butler who was right up there with Benedict Arnold as one of the Revolution's deepest, darkest villains. Carradine does well with the part, no shades of gray in his portrayal. You might recall that Butler was one of the 'jury' at the trial in The Devil and Daniel Webster and Lionel Barrymore played him in D.W. Griffith's silent classic, America.Edna May Oliver is the pioneer widow woman who takes in Fonda and Colbert after their own place is burned to the ground during a raid and won an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She was a hardy soul and she steals the film.This is John Ford's first Technicolor feature and he really did well in the cinematography department. The forest greens of upstate New York really are depicted well, especially in the part where Henry Fonda is being chased by the Indians as he goes for help in the climax.Upstate New York was a key area of the American Revolution. With the British occupying New York City for most of the war, upstate was the bridge in which those rabble rousers in New England kept connected with the south. It's why the Battle of Saratoga was so important, why Benedict Arnold's aborted treachery in turning West Point over to them was so important. If it wasn't for those yeoman farmers in the Mohawk Valley there might not be an America today.And the Mohawk Valley was more important afterwards because another man with vision who was New York's governor named DeWitt Clinton had an idea to extend the headwaters of the Mohawk River straight to Lake Erie with a canal. That act opened up the northwest to trade and made New York the largest city in the USA. No doubt the descendants of Colbert and Fonda worked on the Erie Canal as well. Drums Along the Mohawk is a nice tribute film to some brave people whose battles on that sideshow theater of the war made possible the very existence of America."
5,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,1 March 2011,Romance in Times of the American War of Independence,"In 1776, the apolitical farmer Gilbert 'Gil' Martin (Henry Fonda) gets married to Magdelana ""Lana"" Borst (Claudette Colbert) at the Borst Home in Albany, New York. They travel to his lands in the Mohawk Valley, Deerfield, where they work hard to improve their lives, but their house and crop are burned out by Indians fomented by the British. The couple loses everything including their baby and they have to restart their lives working for the widow Mrs. McKlennar (Edna May Oliver). But it is times of the American War of Independence, and the settlers have to fight against the Indians and the British soldiers to survive. ""Drums along the Mohawk"" is a romance in times of the American War of Independence. John Ford uses the historic moment as background of the tough life of the American colonists in the Mohawk Valley, through the dramatic lives of Gil and Lana. This is not my favorite film of John Ford, but the story is engaging and it is a good movie. The thirty-six year old Claudette Colbert is miscast and too old for the role of Lana. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Ao Rufar dos Tambores"" (""At the Drum Roll"")"
6,Drums Along the Mohawk,10,27 September 2005,Excellent depiction of life during colonial times in New England.,"I've used this movie in many history classes. It illustrates life during these turbulent times when people were moving to the frontier and just trying to live their lives in peace. However, other people had lived on those lands and now wanted it back and war erupted. The American Revolution is vastly different for people on the frontier. There was no help -they had to rely on each other to protect their farms, their families and livestock. It was a hard life but they managed to find humor and enjoyment even during the hardest of times. This movies illustrates the new culture that had to evolve in order to survive. Fighting Indians, British and French became a way of life during this period. These people developed a strong bond of friendship and family. They helped one another in many ways. The only way to get communication from Albany was at church on Sunday when the Reverend would give everyone the latest news about the war as well as cloth that had arrived at the general store in Dayton. It's a good story and one that will remain a favorite."
7,Drums Along the Mohawk,,26 June 2003,Three-strip Technicolor in all its glory!,"Other comments on this film quite well echo my sentiments: John Ford once again exhibits his mastery of the medium, with a minimum of the sentimentality to which he sometimes succumbed; a very young and handsome Henry Fonda wonderfully embodies an ordinary man virtually forced to perform feats of extraordinary heroism; Claudette Colbert, although she seems out of her usually sophisticated element, really cannot be faulted, especially when one considers the Hollywoodized glamor of her makeup and costuming; and Edna May Oliver, heading Ford's customarily astutely chosen supporting cast, almost steals the picture.But, to my eyes, it is the unusually beautiful Technicolor cinematography by Bert Glennon and Ray Rennahan (the latter being the credited cinematographer on the first feature-length film in three-strip Technicolor, 1935's ""Becky Sharp"") who deserve the most accolades.  Their work simply glows and has that special crispness characteristic of certain early Technicolor films (many of which bore the Twentieth Century Fox label, as it happens.)  No doubt, working on outdoor locations with the cumbersome equipment and lighting requirements involved in the use of the Technicolor process at that time, not to mention the lengendarily dictatorial control of the Technicolor Corporation's czarina, Madame (Natalie) Kalmus, and her frequent associate, Henri Jaffa, Messrs. Glennon and Rennahan managed to accomplish one of 1939's finest achievements in color cinematography.  With Alfred Newman's fine musical score and all of the other first-class production values lavished on this stirring tale, ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" deserves a place among the best recreations of those remarkable personal stories that were part of this newly emerging nation.I am not aware if the available VHS tape transfer does justice to the prints struck from the original negative, but American Movie Classics occasionally shows this title (mercilessly chopped up with endless commercials, etc., as is now their wont) in a version that makes one realize why the invention of color television broadcasting just had to happen!"
8,Drums Along the Mohawk,,27 April 2003,A Great Film On the Revolution,"This is one great film to look at on a lazy afternoon.  It is definitely the finest film John Ford ever directed without the use of John Wayne.  The timing of the release of it was interesting due to the fact that the world was edging ever closer to the brink of war and the country needed something to help boost morale.  Also, the performances in this film were great as well.  Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert were wonderful, but the character that really stood out for me was the old spinster, Mrs. McKlennar portrayed by Edna May Oliver.  Too bad it had to be released in 1939.  Due to all the great releases that year, this film definitely got lost in the shuffle."
9,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,13 July 2012,""" This is our  country and it must be defended by young and old alike ""","An early novel called "" Drums Along the Mohawk "" written by Walter D. Edmonds is the foundation for this motion picture of the same name. It relates the story of Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Martin (Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert) a young, married America couple moving from New York city to the early frontier to begin a new life. The time coincides with events from 1776 thru the end of the Revolutionary War. As most Americans have learned from our history, life was incredibly harsh. Indeed, when not working on the toils of the farm, early colonists were often at war with the Native American tribes who had sided with the British army. After their farm is burned and losing their first child, their lives are constantly threatened, they move in with Mrs. McKlennar (Edna May Oliver) a wealthy widow woman to supplement their meager existence. Most of the film is dedicated to the hardship of early frontier life and includes the destruction of their farms and their valiant defense inside the nearby fort. John Carradine, plays the heavy named Caldwell with Arthur Shields playing Rev. Rosenkrantz. For many reasons John Ford creates a formula for the movie establishing himself as a superb director. This early Color picture is fabulous in many ways, not the least is the excellent cast and exciting drama. It's little wonder it has become an excellent Classic. Recommended for all audiences. ****"
10,Drums Along the Mohawk,,14 April 2012,Ford produced an intense layout of the War of American Independence.,"The dramatic action takes place in Albany (NY) and in the Mohawk Valley in present-day territories of New England, Upstate NY, between 1776 and 1783. Gilbert ""Gil"" Martin (Fonda) and Magdalena ""Lana"" Borst (Colbert) are married in Albany and moved as settlers to the Mohawk Valley, where they expect a life of sacrifice, work and adventures. Gil is straight, honest and fair and knows the secrets of cultivating the land. Lana, the daughter of a wealthy family and urban, has to make a big effort to adapt to isolated and lonely life of the field in time of war.It's one of the few films about the War of Independence of the United States (1775-1783). Made by John Ford and written by Lamar Trotti (""Ox-Bow Incident,"" Wellman, 1943) and Sonya Levien, adapted the novel ""Drums along the Mohawk"" (1936), by Walter D. Edmonds. It shot in outdoor scenarios Utah and on the sets of Fox Studios (LA, CA). is nominated for two Oscars (supporting actress and photography). Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and Raymond Griffith (two of the founders of the Fox) The film mixes drama, romance, war and western. Build a strong point of the War of Independence of the United States, which expands and enriches the filmmaker builds treatment of American history through his films, especially westerns. According to his constant, is interested in the daily lives of the settlers, they belong to groups involved in the action as such, the role of women in the border territories, the importance of their role in the early stages of the construction of the country, the terror of the native Indians, the cruelty of war and concern for all aspects of human drama. Combines drama and tragedy with humor, who spent such memorable scenes as the confrontation of the widow McKlennar (Oliver) with two Indians who intended to burn his bedroom and the run of the amputation of a leg of General Nicholas Herkimer (Imhof).The story is based on a simple plot and scenes of great vigor, as the long persecution of Gil by three natives, evoking memories of war and its contemplation by Lana Gil's departure to the war. It makes use of ellipsis and innuendo. The film uses a balanced and measured tone that takes you to build an intense drama that avoids exaggeration. With skill and sparsity of media creates highly emotional situations (wedding, arrival of American troops, hoisting of the flag).The film marks the second collaboration of Ford and Fonda film about a total of six movies. Enhances the strength of women and their ability to work and sacrifice, showing the horrors of war and its aftermath, praised the patriotic spirit, admire the dedication and courage of the pioneers, and explains the"
11,Drums Along the Mohawk,10,24 February 2004,This is one of my favorite films.,"This film has everything, drama, humor, and action.  My favorite character is Mrs. McKlennar, played by the great Dame Edna May Oliver (also see her in A Tale of Two Cities).  She's got the right combination of real independence, sauciness, and feeling.  Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert are also fine as Gil and Lana.  The usual John Ford stock company (Ward Bond, Arthur Shields, etc.) are in evidence in the well cast supporting roles.  I'm kind of surprised that no one has targeted this story for a remake, though it might be a case of watching out what you wish for - it could be ruined by political correctness. Anyway, sit back and enjoy."
12,Drums Along the Mohawk,10,22 June 2007,Triple Play in the Triple Campaign,"Triple Play in the Triple Campaign Plot: In a unique western, settlers face hardships of Indian attacks during the Revolution.The British Invade In 1777 the British began a three pronged invasion of New York State designed to subdivide the Revolution. Drums Along the Mohawk is the story of the people who repulsed the British attack along the western flank.John Ford, the acclaimed director, escaped the curse against American Revolution films by underplaying British involvement and winning the classification 'Western.' Yet this classic American frontier-western is not set against sage brush and cactus of Monument Valley where most John Ford films were shot. This story began in the rich forests of New York and Pennsylvania where British forces struggled throughout 1777-1778 to split the revolutionaries in two. Along a bloodied frontier the American Revolution was won by a touch of the feather.In Drums Along the Mohawk, Newlyweds Gil and Lana Martin (Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert) set out to farm in the lush Mohawk Valley. Gil is a patriot and the country is in the throes and turmoil of birth in war. Tories and their Indian allies, led by the insidious Caldwell (John Carridine) are afoot to burn every rebel farm they can find.Although the Tories are led by the stereotypical bad guy John Carradine, there are nice loyalists as well: Mrs McKlennar (Edna May Oliver), the feisty widow who proclaims her loyalty to George III and forces invading Indians to carry her in her bed outside as they pillage her farmstead.What a gal? No she was simply British by choice! This is a John Ford film. Ford unlike many other filmmakers of his time was sympathetic to the tenacity, nobility and bravery of the American Indian. The Indian at war is a fierce combatant but is equally capable of being a pious Christian.However ahead of his times in portraying the Indians, Ford did play with history just abit claiming an American victory at Oriskany and a repulse by force of arms at Fort Schuyler; indeed movie's claim that the opposing British commander was killed in the final assault at Fort Schuyler is pure crowd appeal. Stunning footage of battle scenes are good, but purely fictional.The film, as well as the book upon which the movie is based, accurately portray the active role taken by Colonial women in defense of Fort Schuyler. Cutting their hair with crude razor blades, women ""manned"" the ramparts. Too many of the men had been killed at Oriskany.Ultimately the Army led by Benedict Arnold did relieve the post; but the day was won by deception rather than force of arms. The British led Indian force besieging Fort Schuyler faded away.We can perhaps forgive John Ford for his historical lapses. Ford's primary purpose was patriotic to show the America which is a community of the whole enduring hardship in loyal to each other rather than the usual concept of the Revolution as parades vacuous speeches and senseless abstractions.John Ford's greatest historical lapse however would invite a chuckle from the most ardent patriot: the flag. According to the movie the settlers first see the flag in the final scene years later after the battle and only after war is won and independence is secured. However in the historical battle for Fort Schuyler the new flag was unfurled in combat for the first time: fashioned out of a soldier's blouse, a woman's petty coat, and an old red shirt.Sentimental at times--but also harsh and realistic, the film depicts the hardships of pioneer life, the ever-present danger as war intrudes upon the lush valley.John Ford: America On Film John Ford: American John Ford (Sean Aloysius O'Fearna) followed his brother Francis to Hollywood. When Francis O'Fearna, an actor, writer and director changed his name to Ford, Sean O'Fearna followed his brother's lead and took the more American sounding name John Ford. Working his way up from stunt work, camera work and film editing, John Ford directed his first picture in 1917, The Soul Herder (Universal).Ford developed a reputation for Westerns, then not taken serious by Hollywood and defined the genre with a group of actors he nurtured, John Wayne, Harry Carey, John Carradine, Henry Fonda, Ward Bond, Francis Ford, Victor McLaglen, Mae Marsh, Mildred Natwick, and others. Their principal virtue said Ford: they take orders.Ford is best known for his great Western/Cavalry trilogy: Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), and Rio Grande (1950) all starring John Wayne together with stock Western characters the big tick mick sergeants Victor McLaglen and Ward Bond. The product of a tough director with a poetic vision, Ford's movies are not simply Westerns, they are a overtures to American culture preserved. Overriding the many historical lapses was Ford's fine attention to the dress, manners and music of America in the 19th Century.In a John Ford Western if you hear the hymn ""Shall We Gather at the River"" or see the character holding aces and eights (the dead man's hand) at poker, you know a funeral will follow.In assuming an American persona Ford did not forget his Irish roots. Ford beat the other motion picture curse against Irish war films in the much acclaimed The Informer (1935), a complex drama of betrayal during the Irish troubles and The Quiet Man (1952), about an American of Irish ancestry who returns to the Eire to reclaim an Irish inheritance."
13,Drums Along the Mohawk,,15 February 2010,Ford goes Technicolor,"John Ford directs ""Drums Along the Mohawk"". It's a gorgeous looking film, though Ford's considerable compositional talents only serve to distract us from what is really a pretty hokey attempt at American myth making.The plot? A group of likable colonists travel to the ominously named Mohawk Valley. Led by the always watchable Henry Fonda (what is it about this guy that makes him so endearing?), they build homes, raise families and tend to their well manicured farms.Conflicts, of course, then arise when the settlers are forced to battle the British Army and a variety of Native American Indian tribes. Armed with muskets and pitchforks our Colonist heroes bravely fend off savage Red Coats and barbaric Red Skins, pausing occasionally to mourn the loss of their loved ones and to lament the burning of their homes.The film ends with the settlers eventually emerging victorious. The British are kicked out of America and the Indians are sourly beaten, leaving our merry band of Colonists to huddle together, babies in their arms and smiles on their faces, as the newly created American flag is hoisted up into the sky. ""There's still a lot of work to be done,"" one character says, as the flag flutters in the wind.You either accept this stuff - essentially a cartoonish apologia for genocide, xenophobia, colonialism and a type of American exceptionalism that continues unabated even to this day - or you don't. Me, I'll take Robert Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs Miller"", an exercise in demythologisation, and a much more interesting account of settlers struggling to ""build America"". Still, if Ford is a man of simple intellect, he's nevertheless one of cinema's great visualists.Forget ""The Searchers"" and forget Monument Valley. Mohawk Valley is where it's at. Made in the late 30s, ""Drums Along The Mohawk"" is Ford's first and best looking colour film. With some darkly lush film-stock and a colour palette that oozes deep greens, rustic browns and the husky glow of cackling firelight, the film is gorgeous to look at. Ford's compositions are clean and uncluttered, simple objects like chairs, muskets, clouds and trees placed with the precision of a classical painter.But for those looking for action, the film also delivers quite a few tense set pieces. Several battles, foot chases and an attack on a fort, all add a visceral kick to the melodrama. Whilst the likes of Peckinpah, Siegel and Leone have rendered many of Ford's ""action sequences"" old fashioned (those once lauded cavalry charges in many of Ford's films now seem comical rather than gripping), the ""action"" in ""Mohawk"" has a painterly quality seldom found in the rest of his career. Think late career Kurosawa and mid-career Lean.So while most of the usual Fordian problems are here - caricatural Indians, jokey old timers, pesky drunks, shameless melodrama, grating music, hokey myth-making, ill-placed comedy, propagandistic history - I'd argue that the sheer ""look"" of the film is really something special. But is technique enough?7.9/10  Thematically and stylistically, Ford was very much a traditionalist. Like most directors of the era (and since), he was trapped in the mentality of the theatre director. This is the belief that cinema only adds a larger canvas to the possibilities already afforded by the theatre stage. IE  we start with some grand landscape shot and then pull in to the key players, acting out the story within a room or small set. This formula is then repeated in various permutations. Compare this to the plasticity of Welles, Resnais or the curious camera of mid-Hitchcock, to see how limited Ford's vocabulary really was, even for its time. And yet, cinema has progressed so little in the past century, that this film, made in the 30s, still feels rather fresh. Compare, for example, ""Drums Along The Mohawk"" to Baz Luhrmann's ""Australia"". Both films are attempts to sanitise history, but Luhrmann's demonstrates just how impossible it is for many modern directors to escape the shadow of Ford.Worth one viewing."
14,Drums Along the Mohawk,5,17 September 2007,Classic-style cinema through and through,"Ahhhh, classic cinema! The Technicolor, the optimism, the stock characters, the racism! Coming to you from main man John Ford is a Western/War drama about Gil and Lana, two newlyweds who move to the countryside to start out their lives, promptly to get involved in the militia that fights in the Revolutionary War. Their eagerness and enthusiasm ingratiates them promptly with the surrounding community, and their misfortunes tell the American tale of burgeoning success against oppression through work and freedom.John Ford is, of course, a great director, and with leads Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert, he paints a very pretty picture that ranges from funny and light-hearted domestic scenes to moments of darkness when the community is surrounded by violent Indians led by the eye-patched John Carradine. His period detail is lovingly built around characters that one can't help but love: the friendly general, the bumbling role-caller, the converted Christian Indian, the gruff but ultimately good-hearted widow, and of course the main characters, Gee-Whiz style Gil and his pretty upper-class beau Lana who both promise to work the land and reap its fruits.The scenes are mostly entertaining, paying more attention to the workings of the community than to the war surrounding them. The preacher adds his own political commentary explicitly in his sermons. People marry, children are born. The town drunk, doubling as the militia roll-call man, brings in some comedic relief. The town's converted Indian Blueback gives domestic advice in stunted ""Me noble savage"" English. Some of them are downright nonsensical, such as the scene where the pair of drunken Mohawks attempt to save the old widow and her bed from the fire that they started after appearing out of literally nowhere. But it's all held with the colorful optimism which tends to define the era, as it rounds up symbols of Americana (the villagers, the freed black man, the native) as they all regard the new American flag, reminding the United States about the land that they are fighting for.--PolarisDiB"
15,Drums Along the Mohawk,9,29 June 2003,"The pioneers, rebuilding their houses and their lives.","When self help books are selling so well, there are some films which have the same effect. As ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is ideal for someone who is depressed, ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" should be seen by newlyweds, specially when they are going through hard times. The great heroes here are specially the women, having the gumption to start all over again, when everything is destroyed by the Mohawks, oriented by the British. At the beginning, before the first attack, they are talking about material objects like Wedgewood pottery, but it all changes,  themselves included. Edna May Oliver gives an impressive performance, she flirts with a much younger Ward Bond and she even scares the Mohawks. Claudette Colbert is better than in any other film I have seen her, and Henry Fonda good as always."
16,Drums Along the Mohawk,2,22 July 2010,Ford's vices on full display,"John Ford is an enigma. He has great virtues and vices as a director. Unfortunately, in this film (as in the Searchers) all his worst qualities are on display. Instead of the inherently dramatic events from Walter Edmonds' novel about Revolutionary War farmers in upstate New York, troubled by divisions within the community between Tories and Patriots, we get Ford's unmistakable brand of maudlin sentiment, and the hysterics of characters who are so simplistically rendered they'll remind you of children pretending.Ford also violates a cardinal rule of good film making by having Henry Fonda's character, Gil Martin, deliriously narrate to his wife the details of his experience in the battle of Oriskany. The scene is static, and Martin's story would have been better shown, not told. But Ford's movies are never entirely without interest. The best part of this movie (an action sequence where Henry Fonda has to outrun some Native American warriors) is a fine set-piece, but the characters have absolutely no dimension. I think Ford worked best when his producers reined him in. We can see this in STAGECOACH, in MY DARLING CLEMENTINE, and in FORT APACHE. But when they gave him his head he could turn out cloying material like DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK, THE SEARCHERS, and RIO GRANDE.In 1939 the three strip Technicolor process was Hollywood's new toy. In most early color features the new medium was the message; story and character development took a back seat as they do here. If you love melodrama and films with lots of action but not much depth, this one might appeal to you."
17,Drums Along the Mohawk,8,6 December 2005,"A unique film since it is a ""Revolutionary Western""","Well, I chose to do an oral report for a WEsterns class a few years back. Since the film is now out on DVD, I thought I'd write some thoughts about it. It is perhaps one of the best 'overlooked"" Ford films. I am one who likes ""Mogambo"" though! Nevertheless, Henry Fona is great here as a patriot leader who must fight off the local tribe to secure his family. It is a very visual film, and the DVD should enhance its' qualities. It is also very well-edited and has a great score. Alas, as one other person pointed out here, it came out in 1939 and it has been overshadowed by Ford's own ""Stagecoach."" The film also proves Ford worked well with other actors besides John Wayne, most notably Fonda and Jimmy Stewart among many others."
18,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,24 March 2012,A John Ford 'Eastern',"This film may be about settlers coming into conflict with the local Indian tribe but it isn't a western; it is set in the Mohawk Valley in what was then the Colony of New York during the time of the war of independence. The story follows a young couple Gilbert and Lana Martin who move into a cabin with the intention of farming and raising a family. Everything goes well at first but one day their property is attacked and burnt by the Mohawks who are fighting on the British side in the war. They may have lost everything but they don't give up hope; instead of returning to Albany they start working on the farm of a local widow. It isn't long before the war comes to their part the country and all the men are conscripted into the militia; we don't see what happens while they are gone but when Gilbert returns he is clearly haunted by what he did and saw. Once again the settle into a normal way of life and once again the Indians return, this time in force burning all the houses as the settlers seek shelter in the fort; the battle that ensues is fairly vicious and if nobody can get out and get help everything will be lost.Given the age of this film I was surprised that not only was it in colour but the colours are so vibrant. Of course what really matter is the quality of the story and how good the acting is; thankfully the story is interesting and well told; we are introduced to the characters and get to know them before the action starts and when it does it is quite thrilling. The acting is good too with Claudette Coleman and Henry Fonda making fine leads. There are a few strangely comic moments in the film such as when the elderly widow remonstrates with the two 'savage' Indians who are setting fire to her house and rather than harm her they carry her downstairs in her bed! The final confrontation was pretty thrilling and a bit more violent than I expected, one man was hit by a flaming arrow! While this isn't a western I'm sure fans of that genre will enjoy it as will people interested in films set in this period of which there are surprisingly few."
19,Drums Along the Mohawk,,21 July 2007,Drums Along the mohawk is a story of indians' life woven into the fronteries',"There are four categories of characters who are present In the movie and each of them appears in its own share. The first and foremost group is the category of white Christians. They have a more dense population in the colonial America , as the movie represents them. Elements of American identity which is defined as white Anglo-Saxon protestant are well presented by the white couple(s). the Martins are in a perfect way the lovely American household whose aim is to move forward and they assure the audience when Gilbert alerts his fearful wife, shocked by the attack of the Indians, of ""not to look back"" again. This denial to look at the shameful past (in which one is probably defeated, and in this case the Americans are defeated) and looking forward into the bright side of the future is one of the prominent characteristics of American identity characterized in drums along the Mohawk. Another prevalent identity factor is the church in which the crowd gathers for every kind of civil activity, at least the movie shows this very well. The father of the church in some cases plays the role of the political leader on whose words people rely. This is the aspect of Protestantism to which we referred at the beginning of the paragraph. The anglo-saxonity of the people is shown by the language that they have carried with them into the continent. Their being humane towards everybody even the one Indian who is engaged with them is very much observable to the audience. Another proof would be the widow who provides the homeless Martins with a not-bad house of their own, all these perhaps a call to the American people of the 1930s and the Great Depression for thinking humanitarian and helping each other."
20,Drums Along the Mohawk,6,5 June 2010,Pretty good Ford,"A regular John Ford classic. Claudette Colbert played her role well, but her character was initially quite unlikeable. I suppose this was to show her personal growth over the course of the film. Fonda was, of course, Fonda, a bottomless pit of earnestness. Edna May Oliver was wonderful as the widow. She got an Ocar nomination, but too bad for her that this was the same year as Gone With the Wind and Hattie McDaniel.A few commentators have lamented that Ford caricatured the Indians and portrayed them as unfairly savage. If anything they were portrayed as not nearly as savage as reality. The North American Indians in general, and the Iriquois in particular, were among the most savage and bloodthirsty races on earth. At least two instances from the film struck me letting them off much too easy. When the widow McKlennar is surprised in her bed by two warriors burning her house, she browbeats them into carrying her out of the room on her bed. These Indians would have immediately tomahawked her to death on the spot. And when the captive is rolled out to be burnt below the walls of the fort, well, the Indians would almost certainly have tortured him to death for their own amusement. There was no military advantage to letting the fort know that he was captured, and the Indians torture of captives was well known. It was a large part of their culture. which was utterly martial. The fort would never surrender, because only torture and death awaited those who did. (On rare occasions captives would be kept alive as slaves, and rarer still, a few were adopted into the tribe) The British would sometimes encourage these massacres, and sometimes try to stop them, almost never with any success. No amount of politically correct revisionism changes what these Indian societies were in those days."
21,Drums Along the Mohawk,8,9 June 2006,"Drums Along The Mohawk (John Ford, 1939) ***1/2","Ford made three great films in this one year, the others being the more quoted YOUNG MR. LINCOLN (1939) and STAGECOACH (1939). For this reason, this one has often been overlooked: patchy but frequently splendid, it's still an important achievement - a painstakingly realized production bearing some of the director's most characteristic traits.Set in the period of the American Revolution, it's not strictly a Western but the film features a number of skirmishes between the settlers and the Indians - flanked by a band of renegades led by a one-eyed John Carradine in another memorable villainous turn for Ford (after having played the sadistic prison warden in an earlier historical piece, THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND [1936]). His death occurs off-screen, but it's subtly suggested by a wonderful bit of business towards the end - involving an Indian who's been converted to Christianity! The cast, as always, is peppered with familiar Fordian faces - most notably Arthur Shields as a fervently patriotic priest! Leads Claudette Colbert and Henry Fonda emerge as the perfect embodiments of the Spirit of America - idealistic, devoted and brave. Typically Fordian, i.e. corny, comic relief is provided by Edna May Oliver and Ward Bond - but, then, the former's fine portrayal of the indomitable frontierswoman par excellence was justly nominated for an Academy Award! The film's color cinematography (which also duly received an Oscar citation) is simply gorgeous, particularly when Ford's camera - this was his first in the process - is directed at the sweeping landscape."
22,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,29 September 2017,Vintage Ford film detailing the trials of a colonial newlywed couple harassed by Indians and British,"Awesome and marvelous Western by the great John Ford and deemed by many to be his early best . 1776 , in American revolutionary , Albany , Gilbert 'Gil' Martin (Henry Fonda who was real descendant of the Fondas that settled in the Mohawk Valley in the mid 17th Century) marries the beautiful Magdelana 'Lana', shortly before the revolutionary war , and takes her West to begin a homestead in the Mohawk Valley , in Upstate New York .

23,Drums Along the Mohawk,10,17 July 2014,A revolutionary wartime masterpiece,"John Ford's Drums Along the Mohawk is the absolute best colonial movie ever made that reminds of why we became a country in the first place. The movie stars Henry Fonda as Gil Martin a farmer who has just been married and then had to serve in the American revolution, (which the beginning is similar to High Noon for when it comes to the beginning of the film but has more of a similar story to Roland Emmerich's 2000 colonial epic The Patriot.). Not only does Henry Fonda give a great performance but so does Claudette Colbert as his newlywed wife. Not only do I think personally that it is the best movie made about the revolutionary war, but it is also a great period piece. Back then it really took a lot to make movies about how our country started. And i think that this goes as one of John Ford's best films."
24,Drums Along the Mohawk,8,28 February 2010,Drums along the Mohawk,Drum along the Mohawk was John Fords first film that he used Technicolor in. The scenery and the colors in the film were great to see. The emotions on Lana and Gilbert Martins face were good. Especially in the scene where the Indians burn their house down. As they are getting ready to leave the camera focuses back on the house being burnt and then right to their faces and you can tell that they knew they lost everything. The sounds of the gun shots and canon being let off during the fight between the town and the Indians was a great scene to see and hear. You could tell the Indians were coming cause they would chant or you would see smoke from them burning houses down. In the end the town won by the help that Gil went to get.
25,Drums Along the Mohawk,4,3 March 2007,Henry Fonda saves New York,"For the first half of the movie the story is faithful to the Walter Edmonds' book. The book originally ran as a magazine serial and was wildly popular in the 1930s and has been a staple in American history class reading lists. That's how I came to read it.But in the second half it goes astray, largely because the book gives equal billing to several characters and the movie has to keep two: Fonda and Colbert front and center. For example, Henry Fonda's character, Gil Martin, sneaks out of the fort at German Flats to go for help from Fort Dayton. In the movie, Fonda outruns three Mohawks. In the book, the event never happens -- or at least not in any way close to the movie. If the movie had remained faithful, Ward Bond's character, Adam, would have played a larger role, at least equal to Fonda's. It would have been Bond's character who outruns the Indian warriors in a chase that is a dramatic highlight of the book. Bond's character had come across a raiding party and he runs to German Flats to sound the alarm.Another dramatic departure from the book is the death of Mrs. McKlennar, played by Edna May Oliver. In the movie she is killed by an Indian's arrow during an attack on the fort. In the book, she dies of old age.The movie avoids showing the brutality of the Indian/Tory attacks--the description of which in the book is based on fact. Scalping was common and the battle in which Gil is wounded early on in the Revolution was a brutal, hand-to-hand affair as described in the book."
26,Drums Along the Mohawk,6,11 January 2015,"Good Period Atmosphere, but Dull Plot and Wooden Dialogue","Drums Along the Mohawk is pretty dull fare. The scenery and historical period activities (clearing forests, barn dances, etc.) are all well done, but otherwise, this is a dull movie. There is no plot to speak of, just a string of raids and battles of American patriots against Tories and Indians. The villain (John Carradine) is undermotivated in the script, and is not given enough screen time to make him into a character worthy of either admiring or hating. Fonda and Colbert are miscast -- neither is suitable for the part, especially Colbert. This error was due to the ""star system"" which caused studios to ""milk"" their big names by putting them in every conceivable movie. (Warner Bros. similarly miscast Errol Flynn as a Western hero in Dodge City in the same 1939 year.)The dialogue and delivery is mostly wooden. Only Edna Mae Oliver comes across as a real human being. (I actually have relatives like that!)The message of the movie -- ""Gee, wasn't life tough in those pioneer days, and how brave young brides had to be to cope with these hardships"" -- is pretty trite. 1939 was a year of great films. Drums Along the Mohawk is not one of them. I know that will outrage those who think that anything directed by John Ford is automatically good, but the fact is that this is one of Ford's clunkers. Great camera work and accurate period flavor do not make a great film. The makers of ""Barry Lyndon"" in the 1970s should have learned that lesson from this 1939 dud."
27,Drums Along the Mohawk,10,13 May 2010,This film will make you love America all over again,"I first saw ""Drums"" dubbed in French at age 7 in front of an old small-screen black and white early TV set in the fifties in my native Quebec. In spite of the bad quality of the print and the primitive technology, it struck me  even then - as elaborately engrossing. But its depictions of Indian attacks warped me for life. For all the political correctness talk of Aboriginal-sensitive commentaries that bemoan the fact that Indians are portrayed like the flying monkeys from ""The Wizard of Oz"", the fact remains that of the more than 300 native cultures in North America, Mohawks were the most violent and troublesome. They were s.o.b.'s then and they are s.o.b.'s now and forever getting into trouble with the laws of my native Quebec (which offered them asylum after the war and to this day), neighbouring Ontario and New York State. They may have fought against the Revolution but we were stuck with them for 250 years.It was quite a revelation to see the film again in the wondrous 2005 DVD restoration with its sound spatialised for stereo equipment. I saw the colours and the detail and heard the original English dialogue for the first time. The film has acquired a lot of new qualities to my eyes and ears during that viewing - even though the Mohawks were still the blood-thirsty bastards I remembered. I will try to name a few reasons for loving that film.THE RESTORATION AND PHOTOGRAPHY: The restorers worked from a well preserved early interpositive that they cleaned up electronically. Although the results can't compare with the wonders of the expensive ultra-resolution process where all three colour layers of Technicolor are realigned electronically, the image is still for the most part stunning and showing very little misregistration. The day-for-night scenes may be a little wanting in the contrast department, but, all in all, the DVD shows the viewer examples of what made Technicolor such a fascinating novelty. The director of photography takes loving care in giving the viewer his money's worth by showing landscapes, sunrises, sunsets, high noon, cloudy skies, clear skies, forest trails, interiors, thunderstorms, moonlight and candlelight in a way that black and white photography could only suggest. And everything gives the illusion of having been shot on location and mostly outdoors even when logic dictates that this is impossible.THE HISTORICAL INTEREST: There are very few films showing the reality (and the horror) of the Revolutionary War and its impact on frontier people. This film is a magnificent reconstruction. The Black servant Daisy and the good Indian Blue Back may be given short shrift all through the film but they are counted among the characters who proudly salute the new flag of the United States in the final scene when Gil says to his wife that there is still ""a heap of work to do"" to make this a real country. I also liked Alfred Newman using ""Country Gardens"" as a musical theme representing the gentility of the lifestyle  and the home country - the pioneers left behind.THE MUSIC: Alfred Newman is a rustic melodist but a very sophisticated musicologist and orchestrator. His music, while never calling attention to itself, does a wonderful job of underlining the numerous suspense scenes with intelligent commentary that has nothing to do with today's ""fear music"", which is all about percussion, electronic effects and high noise level. His work gives the film its soul through its drama, comedy, suspense and pathos.THE ACTORS: Henry Fonda  perfectly cast (his family actually founded the village of Fonda on the Mohawk River) - gives one of the best speeches of his career. Claudette Colbert, whom it can be suspected was offered the part for her box-office appeal and as a consolation prize for not doing ""Gone With The Wind"", renounces all mannerisms and compensates for bad casting by acting in a purely visceral and physical way. She succeeds in portraying a subservient and modest wife  which is quite a stretch for her. Edna May Oliver is also given a meaty part of a woman of courage and expression, which she manages to underplay and make real. All the other John Ford regulars (with special kudos to Ward Bond)are equally memorable in making the sometimes quirky and era-specific characters come to life.For all those reasons, this is a film worth preserving and seeing over and over again when one wants to get in touch with the real spirit of the American Revolution, the sacrifices it cost and what it was supposed to accomplish."
28,Drums Along the Mohawk,9,11 February 2006,well-made and very interesting,"I really liked this film. I think the biggest reason is that so few Hollywood films are about early American history and many of those that were made are so boring. This isn't the case with this film. You get a very good sense of the type people who settled the American West (when this would have been western PA, TN and OH). As always, Henry Fonda does a great job of playing the average guy placed in extraordinary situations and Claudette Colbert is surprisingly good as well (I was VERY used to seeing her in chic evening dresses--this was a nice change). Historically speaking it's a decent film, though I am sure American Indians would take offense to their rather one-dimensional portrayal (which was the norm in those days), but at least they weren't as stupidly stereotypical as they were in some movies."
29,Drums Along the Mohawk,,28 February 2015,drums along the mohawk,"Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)is one of three films John Ford directed in 1939. The two others were Stagecoach and Young Mr. Lincoln. Drums Along the Mohawk is the one out of the three most overlooked according to scholars. This was also John Fords first film in color, and had excellent cinematography that captures mountains and scenery extremely well while at the same time capturing the harsh life in the west. It was certainly deserving of its Oscar nomination for best color cinematography. The film staged action scenes extremely well especially the long chase involving Gil and the Indians. Although this film is not Fords most famous, it still shows his skill in cinematography, and film."
30,Drums Along the Mohawk,,28 January 2014,John Ford's first color movie,"Exciting dramatic story of a Colonial pioneer couple (Henry Fonda, Claudette Colbert) from the start of their marriage through the end of the Revolutionary War. This is John Ford's first Technicolor picture. For a director who made such great use of shadow in his black & white movies, it must have been quite the adjustment to get used to color. Not just from a technical standpoint, but from an artistic one as well. But he does a spectacular job here. Great supporting cast includes an eyepatch-wearing John Carradine, Ward Bond, and Edna May Oliver. Oliver steals the show, as she often did. She received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work. Fonda and Colbert are excellent, as well. A wonderful film full of romance, drama, action, humor, and tragedy. For a modern American viewer like myself it's refreshing to see these older nonjudgmental films that pay respect to our forefathers. It couldn't be made today."
31,Drums Along the Mohawk,,19 February 2007,Bedsquatting Against the Flow,"Here's the problem: I just don't John Ford. I don't like the way he panders, the way all nuance is erased and only, only broad strokes presented. He was an innovator with space, in particular grand exteriors. And he sometimes does sweep me up. But its all in the service of a dramatic simplicity that hurts me, blunts my senses.Its odd, I suppose, that something can be clear and powerful and effective, that it can actually touch you and still be harmful. Well, I suppose it isn't so odd, because we do get hurt, and there are people who touch us by simplifying their efforts and energies to such an extent that it hits deep.For me, storytelling is about someone working with me to help weave my soul in ways that I couldn't otherwise. A storyteller who wants to just occupy my time so that he can get his bread isn't welcome. And particularly unwelcome is someone willing to be so selfish that he will work against my interest in order to fool himself into my home.This is a good case, because it is grand form without John Wayne, who provides his own distractions. It has all the standard elements of a Ford project including the notion that women need to be beaten a little for their own good. Patriotism, evil and the equating of good with open sky.So I caution you that this is harmful stuff; you enter it at high risk and there is scant reward here.If you do, there are two interesting things to look for. One is a matter of space. We have two internal spaces that are rendered here: the church in the fort and the widow's home. That home becomes a hospital where our heroine cares for her husband. Its shot conventionally: him prone on the floor, she behind caressing his head, which is propped against a wall. After some dramatic histrionics, she asks a man to help lay him down. This fellow steps between us an the camera. His whole backside fills the screen. Its very disturbing because nearly everything we see until that point is there for a very specific narrative reason.This isn't. Our view is obstructed by something that looks like a mistake. He's even out of focus. It functions as a sort of break from the visual narrative, a pause, a step out of the flow. A mistake? No. Later the situation is reversed: he is in the same position with her in the church. He similarly asks for help and there is a very similar intercession, man blocking view. Its shot further away and is no so jarring because his back and butt don't fill the whole screen. But once again, we find ourselves craning to see around him. Its competence worth noticing.The other interesting thing to watch for is Edna May Oliver. She had already had a career starring in her own Hildgard Withers detective series, and was known to the audience, more so than Fonda, who is billed below Colbert. She plays a widow who takes in the beleaguered couple. Its a conventional role, but it written with some interesting overtones. There's one scene that matters.Remember that the whole Ford effect has to do with contrasting interior space with exterior. Part of that is establishing the importance and enclosure of some key internal spaces. The Widow is awakened from sleep by two wild Indians. Have to be wild, you see. These are the closest we get to actually seeing Indian behavior. They seem retarded or drunk. They are there to burn down her house and want her to leave. She refuses and while they set fire to the bedroom, she commands them to remove her precious bed; she will not leave that bed, in fact will not leave actually sitting on the bed.Later, we see that she and the bed have been transported as far as downstairs and to the front door and abandoned, she still aggressively squatting. Its pretty poignant, uncharacteristic of Ford, and probably only allowed because it could be seen as comic.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
32,Drums Along the Mohawk,2,1 April 2006,Simple Reminders,"Visual narrative was an expensive proposition back in these days, so the chief consideration was economy: there are no flashback sequences, one battle is recounted through monologue, virtually all character development is through spoken words, with little visual dialogue. Simple images, simple messages...that we are a nation of frontiersmen, who pull together when the going gets tough. We begin in 1776 with a wedding, and after a battle is won, hey presto, it's 1781, the war's over and we salute the triumphant flag.Cinema is hard to find here; the only evidence of a third spatial dimension includes a long perspective shot of the regiment heading off to battle, Fonda on horseback racing towards the burning homestead, and, perhaps most famously, Fonda on foot eluding three pursuers against a wrack of clouds in the sunrise. The rest might as well be stage scenery, and hammy stage acting.Rather shocking today is Colbert shrieking at the sight of a native American (back then, there was no other word but 'Indian'), and the hero Fonda slapping his wife across the face -- before the marriage is even consummated!. A villager derides the 'snivelling women'. Chief John Big Tree plays a stereotype (later spoofed in ""Airplane!""). We know he's killed off a bad guy because he dons the deceased's eye patch, with a wink at us. However, Colbert is later redeemed when she blows away a marauder with her rifle -- a scene exactly copied in ""Dances With Wolves""."
33,Drums Along the Mohawk,10,12 September 2002,One of Ford's very best,"An exceptional film from John Ford (what else should I expect?). This one is set during the American Revolution, around 1776, in the frontier area of the Mohawk River Valley (Ohio?). A British soldier named Caldwell (John Carradine) has come to pay the Indians of the area to make war against the Americans. Among them are Gil and Lena Martin, who have just recently married and are now trying to build a life for themselves. When the Indians ravage their farm, they are forced to move in with Mrs. McKlennar (Edna May Oliver, in a great role), a benevolent widow. This is a part of American history that hasn't been adequately covered, and this is easily the best film like this that I've seen (even if it might be the only). The setting is beautifully created. Ford often focuses on the strict procedures of the military, but here we see armed forces that are rather hastily thrown together. There are a couple of great action sequences, but perhaps the most memorable piece of the film is Fonda's vivid telling of a bloody battle. I like his dazed look and tone, and the fact that, even when there's no one really listening to him, he stumbles through the horrific story as if its telling is all that matters in the world. Henry Fonda did much of his best work with John Ford, and this is up there right next to his Tom Joad in the next year's The Grapes of Wrath. Claudette Colbert is an actress whose popularity has steadily declined since the studio system fell. It's not too much of a tragedy. I mean, she's not a bad actress, of course, but she just looks...fake. I admit that I haven't seen too many of her performances. I like her most in The Palm Beach Story - comedy suits her well. She's adequate in Drums Along the Mohawk, but I would probably refer to her as the weak link in the picture. Even as the weak link, Colbert doesn't harm the final product much at all (perhaps, though, if a great actress had landed the role the film wouldn't be as forgotten today as it seems to be). Ford regular Ward Bond has a choice role, one that seems like it was meant for Victor McLaglen (who had one of his most memorable roles that year in Gunga Din). Still, Bond was a character actor with an amazing range, and he is quite good as the loud but lovable lout. 10/10."
34,Drums Along the Mohawk,,9 November 2005,Lesser Ford/Fonda - flawed but memorable,"The collaborations between John Ford and Henry Fonda are the stuff of legend. In Fonda, the director found a figure upon which to project his heady idealism, building works of sublime visual poetry around his tall, noble, honest star. Then in 1948 Ford made Fort Apache, turning Fonda's screen image - and the Western - on its head, and drawing from him a complex and brilliant performance. If we compare Apache with Once Upon a Time in the West, it possible to see just how much of an influence Ford had on his star - keeping a strict rein on the actor and preventing him from slipping into the lazy, later caricature of his OUATIW baddie.--- *MINOR SPOILERS* --- Drums Along the Mohawk was the second of their films together, a Revolutionary War-set drama released between the twin peaks of Young Mr. Lincoln and The Grapes of Wrath. Fonda is well cast as Gilbert Martin, a naive but dedicated farmer establishing his homestead in upstate New York, whilst trying to adjust to the strains of his recent marriage to Lana (Claudette Colbert). When the newlyweds' farm is razed to the ground by Indians, the couple flee. They are soon taken in by their selfless neighbours, and Gilbert joins the militia. ---Whilst Drums is not a bad film, it nevertheless has three major problems. First, and most important, is the miscasting of Claudette Colbert in a key role. Though I'm a fan of much of her earlier work, she is completely out of place in late-18th century America. The role demands honesty, believability and empathy. Colbert, lost without her usual staples of witty banter, cocktails and evening dresses, gives a performance that is shallow, unbelievable and shrill. The second problem is the story. Ford, never one for sticking to the facts, unfortunately comes unstuck here. Utilising every facet of his singular genius, he would be hard pushed to manufacture a classic from the crude plot, and he's working at only 70, maybe 80 per cent here. Contrary to the beliefs of Sonya Levien and screen writing legend Lamar Trotti (co-adapting Walter Edmonds' novel), the revolutionary war was not started by one bad man with an eyepatch. Since the purpose of the film is clearly to focus on the evolving relationship of two newlyweds with the land and with one another, against a tumultuous backdrop, surely it would have been better to dispense altogether with the false history and just close in on the characters. The presentation of Blue Back is also weak and borders on the simplistic/offensive. The third problem is the use of colour photography. Ford's unsure handling of this new medium is obvious, and results in the film possessing a garish sub-Minnelli look, bathing the scenery in eyesore colours. There is, however, much to commend. The dialogue is very strong in spots, Fonda's performance is excellent (as always), and the climactic chase is stunningly shot and edited. Fonda's return from war is also wrenchingly powerful. As always with Ford, the supporting cast is excellent, both on paper and on screen, with Edna May Oliver and the great Ward Bond unquestionably the standouts. Look also for one of Ford's favourite motifs - the lone woman waving farewell atop a hill, which is masterfully executed here."
35,Drums Along the Mohawk,10,20 August 2001,Colonial Movie at its best,"Superb John Ford drama dealing with colonists in upstate New York at the time of the American Revolution. A great cast including Henry Fonda, Claudette Colbert, Edna May Oliver (at her best) and Ward Bond. The film depicts every day life in an remote New York settlement during the time of the American Revolution. It draws upon the viewer from the action scenes to the birth of the Martin's child. The characterizations are superb. Edna May Oliver is again overpowering in her role as the widow Mrs Mcklennar. She's complimented beautifully by Ward Bond. The film has love, tragedy, triumph and suspense. No matter how many times I've seen it, it seems to get better and better with age."
36,Drums Along the Mohawk,5,28 April 2012,Let there be drums,"A typically enjoyable John Ford frontier romp, set around the time of the American War of Independence and filmed in glowing colour. It contains the usual mix and at times unusual juxtaposition of broad humour with great pathos, although the accent is more on the latter, particularly the lengthy scene of the returning first-time soldier frontiersmen, battered, bruised and weather-beaten but not bested In battle. In the end they're required to put up an Alamo-type defence of their homestead, until the cavalry comes, summoned by Henry Fonda's Gil character after an extended marathon race against three pursuing Indians which must have broken the Olympic record. As stated, Ford's sometimes abrupt changes of mood and scene jar somewhat, for example, in an early scene Claudette Colbert's prim city girl Lana goes native at the sight of a native Indian, requiring a sock on the jaw from Fonda to calm her down, from which point she becomes the perfect supportive wife, helping on the farm, delivering children and even fighting back marauding Indians by the end.For me, the Fonda / Colbert relationship didn't convince, however. She seems too old to be the sweet, virginal wife and is rather matronly throughout. Fonda, if anything seems too young for his part, a fresh-faced youth which no amount of trying experiences seems to age or weather. That apart, it's impossible not to like other aspects of the movie, including Ford's direction of crowd scenes and some wonderful cinematography, none more so than when Fonda outruns his pursuers under the golden hue of a setting sun. Ford made better movies than this in this year never mind the rest of his long career, even if it is one of those ""Indian-bashing"" films he would live to regret later in his career. However it's made so well that it's probably best to let the story simply unfold of itself, without looking for logic."
37,Drums Along the Mohawk,6,21 October 2007,I'm An Indian Too?,"Towards the end of this film much is made of an extended sequence where Henry Fonda sneaks out of a beleaguered fort to get help and in doing so TOTALLY outruns the three indians on his trail. This would have been more believable if we had been provided with any previous proof of or even reference to Fonda's skill in this area. As it is he merely says he can outrun any Indian on earth yet up to now we've seen him driving a team, scything corn and chopping trees. If you don't have a problem with sloppy writing like this - the film opens, for instance, with the wedding of Fonda and Claudette Colbert in an urban setting prior to them settling in the backwoods of upstate New York where Fonda has a cabin. We're never told how a backwoodsman like Fonda came to meet a townie like Colbert in the first place or what they could possibly have in common on which to base a marriage. Colbert herself is something of a fish out of water in a rural setting, her metier was Park Avenue rather than National Park and without a wisecrack on her lips and a martini in her hand she's unfairly handicapped. On the credit side there's some nice photography and Edna May Oliver watchers will welcome another sighting and an Orcar-winning one at that. See it once and move on to later Ford."
38,Drums Along the Mohawk,2,7 February 2007,"Drums along the Mohawks, not reserving A name, great as John Ford.","Drums along the MohawkProduced in 1939 by John Ford, the American film maker and director, Drums Along the Mohawk is an adventures which involves the romance of a newly wed couple, Lana Borst Martin and Gilbert Martin (presented by Claudette Colbert and Henry Fonda). After their wedding, Young Gilbert takes his bride to the Mohawk valley. Mohawk is one of those newly settled lands by whites in the mid-eighteenth century. Facing the threats of the Britain's Indian allies, in this village the young couple has neither relative nor any clear idea of its future. Of course, one of the most important issues there would be the presence of the Indians in the nearby lands. From the very early moments, just after the wedding ceremony sequence, the first introduction of an Indian feature, Blue Back (Chief John Big Tree) is accompanied with horror. Although artificial and for adding humor, the scene is, willingly or by ignorance, reconstructing the already shaped image of the Indians as the embodiment of terror and discomfort; the scene in which the young lady faces Blue Back in the old lodge. The represented picture of Indians is dualistic and this duality has some implication: one is the lovely Blue Back; he is a red skin in the white costume. The other is the terrifying and absolutely savages, who do not have the crucial thinking ability to make decision in how to ravage the houses. In one of these attacks to the whites' houses, the old lady, Mrs. Sara McKenna (Edna May Oliver) who has given job to and supported the young couple by supplying them a place to reside in, obliges the two giant Iroquois to steal her ''beloved'' bed respectfully, by ''turning it upside-down'', and the two stupid Indians obey it with great surprise and appreciation. However, the first one doesn't make a better sense to the viewer in this respect. As he is with the American people, normally is considered to have a better feature in the film. Logically, he has accustomed himself to the colonists' modes of life and behavior. He has converted to Christianity, wears American costumes such as his hat; speaks deficient English, and lives with them a domestic life. Lack of sharpness of mind is shared by both. Historically, the setting of the movie is the threshold of the Revolution. The era in which there is great amount of challenges, mutiny, treason, and spy hood among and between the British agents, patriot and loyalists among both American colonists and Indians. Another character that is notable is the one-eyed British captain Morgan (tom Tyler) .A malicious, bad-hearted guy, he is responsible of intriguing the Iroquois against the colonists and in setting the villages ablaze, and terrifying the people in the valley. The story engages the characters in a chronicle of the aforementioned part of the American history. The most populating group involved is, of course, the American whites. All types exist in the plot. The most important ones, after all, are the first two or three characters; Henry Morgan is the white, handsome, well brought up, diligent, and patriot lover. His wife, Lana, the pretty bride, has had the life of a well-to-do family. She is quite unfamiliar with the new culture, but the friendly people of the region embrace her affectionately. One of these is Mrs. Sara McLennan, an old lady who is not that good looking, but sharp and a little too courageous as a woman. Drums along the Mohawks can't be put among Ford's good productions, although it has received Oscar rewards, and a great deal amount of attention from the audiences. It seems that this is in great part due to its being a Fordian product and not its own efficiency. Aesthetically speaking, and compared with his better films, such as The Gone with the Wind, Young Mr. Lincoln, How Green Was My Valley, Grapes Of Wrath, and so many other movies, the movie lacks the usual attractiveness and harmony. One can not put it exactly among one of the distinct genres as the others. On the other hand, many critics believe that it puts the Indians at the bottom of naivety, the land being theirs; they haven't received the attention enough as to be represented thoroughly or efficiently in the film. Although it can be said that John Ford hasn't put it by volition. He has, in fact, never been engaged in the racialist or bias ideologies that have captured some among his colleagues."
39,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,8 February 2014,Cartoonish and Fordian But Watchable,"There are a Couple Things that make this an Endurable John Ford Sermon. The Early Technicolor, and a Few Good Scenes of Tension and Battle. What is Hardly Endurable is the Preaching and Overacting that is Typical Ford. The Overt Sentimentality and Overplaying Certain Aspects that were so Near and Dear to the Director.The Birthing Baby Scene just goes on Forever and becomes Somewhat Intolerable, the Cartoonish Characters like the Happy Drunk (even while being tortured and burned to death), Patriotism as Religion, and just so much Heavy Handedness. Then there's Propaganda like Fonda's (read American) Proclaiming, ""No Indian alive can outrun me!"".But it is an Entertaining Film and the Final Siege at the Fort is Stunning in its Gripping Brutality. Fonda and Colbert are All Right and Edna May Oliver is again a Scene Stealer, but the Supporting Cast is nothing but a Silly Conglomerate of Overt Stereotypes and Overacting.Certainly Worth a Watch for the Aforementioned Good Parts, but Far from a Classic or Enticing Cinema. That is Typical of most John Ford Stuff. Some rather Great Scenes, but His Movies as a Complete Piece of Art, Generally with a Few Exceptions, cannot Withstand the Weight of Ford's Ego."
40,Drums Along the Mohawk,8,8 October 2006,"""We did a little fighting round here ourselves""","The American revolutionary war has never been a popular subject for film. However it was perhaps inevitable that John Ford  a director who constantly returned to the theme of civilizing the wilderness and the building of the United States  would tackle it eventually. Typically for Ford though he ignores the major historical events and concentrates on a single community trying to carve a niche for itself in the new nation.This was Ford's first film in colour  and early days of colour film for everyone  and it shows. He doesn't really make use of different shades and makes his compositions in terms of light and dark only, as if filming in black and white. On top of that there is  the curse of early Technicolor!  horrible, gloomy day-for-night cinematography.There isn't really a huge amount to be said about Drums Along the Mohawk. The acting performances are adequate. There are all the usual John Ford ingredients  the warmth of community and family, eccentric supporting characters, a bit of comic relief balanced out with some dark tragedy. Most of it is good fun, but it doesn't exactly sparkle.A particularly annoying aspect early on in the film is the stereotypical screaming female lead. Claudette Colbert could give Fay Wray a run for her money in the screeching hysterically stakes. Luckily her character is toughened up as the picture goes on, and by the end is fighting alongside the men.The best moment in the film comes in the final minute, when a stars-and-stripes is raised up on the fort tower. In the nicest looking shot compositions of the whole picture we see the various surviving characters looking proudly up at it. Whether or not you're an American patriot (I'm not) it's a stirring scene. Funnily enough though the background music here is the tune of My Country, 'tis of thee, which as well as being an American patriotic song also happens to have the same tune as the British national anthem! Strangely no-one working on the film seemed to spot the irony in that."
41,Drums Along the Mohawk,,17 April 2004,Great film!,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSAlthough it may be considered politically incorrect by today's standards, this is a wonderful, underrated film featuring Henry Fonda and the equally talented Claudette Colbert as the newly married couple trying to make it in a small community during the American Revolution.The film has a great deal of historical significance involving the American Revolutionary war, conflicts with Native Americans, etc.  For those who are fans of American history, this movie is for you.Director John Ford's touch to this film makes it equally fascinating.  Like ""The Searchers,"" Ford stays true to his special style of film direction."
42,Drums Along the Mohawk,,29 October 1998,A Different Kind of Western,"When we speak of the American frontier, we often forget that, before it was the deserts of New Mexico or Arizona, it was the forests of Pennsylvania and upstate New York. This film is an American Revolution story of that frontier. It has often been overlooked in American film history, probably because it came out in the same year as another historical epic, ""Gone with the Wind."" Personally, however, I think this is a better film with better characters, a more interesting plot and more action, even if it's not quite as visually stunning as GwtW."
43,Drums Along the Mohawk,,24 November 2009,Stars & Stripes checkered past,"The film was fun to watch: especially the slapping of women, pathetic but funny Indians, praying for a good day of Tory and Indian killing, how liquor makes you quicker (ooops, no it didn't), etc. One would like to think we were on the right side in the Indian Wars, but we weren't. Like many treaties that were to come, ""we the people"" broke many promises to the original Americans. A good example of propaganda in the form of film. I have never seen a more girly pioneer woman in Colbert's characterization. Jeez, look at her run as she watches Gil march away. And then the whole hysterical fit when Blue Back arrives. And did you notice what looks like a plastic nock on the arrow that hits the tree as Gil is running to Fort Dayton! Not a big deal, but funny to see the master Ford's misattention to detail. Otherwise it's a great film!"
44,Drums Along the Mohawk,5,14 October 2009,Drums Along the Mohawk,"Drums Along the Mohawk is an interesting film that deals with many issues pertaining to revolutionary era America. The costumes and language are not be period correct and the film has no real historical substance. But the script is sophisticated and there are many dynamic, round characters that help the plot sufficiently. Early in the film the two main characters, Gilbert Martin (Henry Fonda) and his wife Lana (Claudette Colbert) lose everything, spiraling them into a series of events throughout the film. There are many aspects of this film that are quite sub par, for one, the dated ideas on native Americans. This film shows Native Americans as barbarians and man hunters, Drums Along the Mohawk is certainly not a film that respects both sides of American Culture. Overall Drums Along the Mohawk is a dated 'historical' account of the revolutionary war. Besides the obvious reasons for not particularly liking the film, there are some very good, unique camera shots and angles throughout the movie. As a historical film, this one rates quite poorly, as a form of entertainment and movie for people to enjoy, it was quite good."
45,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,6 August 2009,"Right out of the history book, though maybe the wrong one.","The colonial period is one that nearly all students in this country learn about and so it is popular with those that make movies and other visual learning tools. Here, the great American director John Ford tells the tale of a fictional group of pioneers in a very real part of history of this country. Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert portray Gil and Lana Martin, an average American newlywed couple that move out to the frontier, or what is considered the frontier which is really the Mohawk Valley in central New York. Here, they experience many of the now-cliché events in a colonial period piece, including Indian attacks and the tough grunt work of daily living.There is no doubt that Ford is exemplary in his attributes of being able to capture certain eras and the feelings that are associated with it. Here, he finds time for beautiful scenery from the winter as well as a sunrise that is nothing short of breathless. However, the most glaring aspect of his career has always been his portrayal of foreigners, particularly Native Americans. Here, they are the quintessential savage, ignorant, ruthless and speak dumb-down English. Despite this somewhat racist look at Indians, this is still an entertaining and mostly accurate account of the times. Nothing extraordinary happens; simply a scene from a history book depicting the hard-working attitudes Ford believed Americans had then and should have now. For that reason alone, it is an important viewing."
46,Drums Along the Mohawk,6,22 May 2008,"""Any man failing to report to duty will be promptly hanged. Amen.""","John Ford's first in Technicolor, 'Drums Along the Mohawk (1939),' is something of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it is a rare example of the Revolutionist Western, as most genre entries typically restrict themselves to the Civil War (1861-1865), and I was interested to learn about a period of American history of which I am completely ignorant {though I hear that Ford is the last person one should look towards for history lessons}. With a strong cast of leading and supporting actors, the film is a relatively engrossing look at the difficult lifestyle of the frontier settlers, and how their daily routine is thrown into chaos by the relentless march of war. On the other hand, the film contains various moments of cloying sentimentality, silly writing, racial stereotyping and more unabashed flag-waving patriotism than most non-Americans are willing to endure.The film is largely about human interactions, and visuals aren't particularly important as long as the actors make the story seem interesting. This is accomplished to a certain degree, and Edna May Oliver {who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar} is the film's highlight as Sarah McKlennar, the aggressive old widow who, despite her independence, pines for her beloved late husband. Henry Fonda, always a dependable performer, plays Gil Martin, an honest farmer who weds city-girl Lana (Claudette Colbert, known largely for her comedic roles) and, somewhat reluctantly, brings her out into the frontier to start a new life. When suitably-stereotypical Indians destroy their home, the couple begin working for Sarah McKlennar, a grumpy and stubborn woman who grows fond of the pair. I thought I detected an element of cynicism in the character of Rev. Rosenkrantz (Arthur Shields), who nonchalantly melds politics into his sermons and requests the God's assistance in even the most trivial of matters, but, considering John Ford's religious beliefs, this seems somewhat unlikely.Despite admittedly watching the film on a VHS that was apparently recorded some time in the 1980s, a non-ideal experience at the best of times, I found Ford's visual style to be rather plain, with a few inspired moments captured in between. Especially after watching the dazzling Expressionism of Ford's 'The Fugitive (1947),' the cinematography of Bert Glennon and Ray Rennahan is pretty ordinary, with characters occasionally lost in the darkness of the nighttime, and  with the exception of Fonda's cross-country flight ahead of the rising sun  nothing extraordinary is done with the newly-popularised colour technology. Late in the film, there arises an interesting peculiarity when Fonda announces, out of the clear blue sky, his astonishing ability to outrun anything on two legs. The subsequent chase, in which he outlasts three determined Indians, is a breathless and gripping pursuit, but you wonder at what point our hero suddenly became an Olympic marathon runner.When production of 'Drums Along the Mohawk' began to run behind schedule and over-budget, producer Darryl F. Zanuck, knowing that a great battle had yet to be filmed, became understandably anxious. He bombarded the director with constant angst-ridden telegrams, and Ford decided to abandon the entire sequence; placing Fonda in front of the camera, he gently put forth a succession of questions concerning the conflict, and the actor improvised from there, drawing upon his own understanding of Gil Martin. In a deliberate, deadpan tone of voice, Fonda recounts the horrors of skirmish; the horror of comrades falling beside him; the terrifying war-cry of the enemy; the appalling waste of life. This was the slice of Ford genius for which I had been waiting."
47,Drums Along the Mohawk,,20 January 2007,A newly-wed couple will lose their home as a result of Wars of Independence.  After war is over and everybody starts constructing his life.,"There are various themes that can be discussed here about the movies but the leading theme of the movie was the force of religion. White Anglo-Saxon Protestant emigrating from Britain carries a religious prophecy; they have Christianized Indians, tamed them and taught then how to behave. Through the film, in many occasions Americans call each other Christians, that means they are more identified with their religion rather that their ethnicity or family background. Church as a symbol of religiosity plays a very important role in the film. More interestingly is that even the political issues like war and general Washington orders are all announced by the priest.One of the issues that come along this religious responsibility by Americans is the depiction of Indians as savage, unskilled and lunatics. During the fights and war scenes, one could see just Indians fighting, killing, burning and murdering. Lana entering her cabin is unusually frightened by the sight of an Indian. Indians treat an old lady wildly and burn her house, Indians can not acquire Language well and finally Indians are half-naked, all of these generate a meaning toward Indians. Through this film, a moral humanity has been labeled to Whites. Interestingly enough in the movie no White, whether British or American, were dealt with crime, murder or savagery.Self- sacrifice and heroism were hinted in the deep layers of the movie. Lana's character reminds every viewers of Scarlett O'Hara in ""Gone with the Wind""; the happy, well-born girl in a well-off family that struggles in life and works and sacrifices to achieve the lost things. Lana along the story learns to adapt herself to the difficult new environment. Lana gradually get pride and enjoyment in harvesting crops, she asks her husband to go to war, she cures her husband's wound kindly when he is back from the battle. Generally, the role women play in this movie was great, especially Lana and Mrs. McKlennar. Women fight with Indians along with their husbands and help them to prepare farms.Beyond major issues that are discussed, there come minor elements of American identity in the movie. Americans will not tolerate being oppressed by other countries specifically by British and if it happens again like the Fascism or Nazism in Europe, Americans will once again stand up and claim their freedom. The American character of optimism was injected in to the movie, even its setting. Most of the scenes were bright and it conveys a sense of hope to future. The concept of flag as an important element of American identity was the ending message of the film; the love and respect they give to their flag is shown properly. It is necessary to mention that American flag was raised in the height and not on the ground."
48,Drums Along the Mohawk,9,20 November 2001,"Swing High, Swing Low","John Ford's Drums Along the Mohawk is quite good most of the time, and has some stunning scenes and outstanding costume and set design, but it drags a bit at times, as it as much as Darryl Zanuck picture as a Ford one, and as much a vehicle for Claudette Colbert than either. Once one accepts this, it's a rousing historical adventure set in upstate New York in the late eighteenth century. Henry Fonda is on hand as the hero, and he's sincere and winning as a newlywed married to a woman of a higher class. Colbert is okay as his wife but did comedy better than drama; while John Carradine as the villain of the piece, along with Arthur Shields, Edna May Oliver and Ward Bond, make for a fun ride. The Indians are presented as either bloodthirsty savages or pious Christians. That the British are behind it all helps make them a tad more sympathetic. This is not a deep film, and its patriotic aspects have dated badly; but as the world was on the eve of war when it was made this is  understandable. There are some stunning shots of Fonda running through fields and forests, with Indians in hot pursuit. The battle scenes are good, as one would expect from Ford; but the real point of the film, to the extent that it has one, is that America is a community as much as an idea, and that loyalty to the group is the key to our success. England may have a king, and a lot more money, but we have each other."
49,Drums Along the Mohawk,6,25 April 2006,Stereotypes and factual errors abound in Ford misfire,"I realize that some of the things you can count on in a John Ford film is multiple factual errors, racism and stereotypes. I believe that all of this is calculated by Ford. He is giving you his view of the type of America he believed should have existed, even if it actually didn't. And many people applaud this view and praise his films, regardless of their inaccuracies.I will grant you, that he is a master of the visual image. In so many of his pictures you are captivated by the scenery, vistas and tableaux that he sets (usually against a sunset or sunrise) ""Drums Along The Mohawk"" has many of the John Ford trademark shots.But ultimately Ford's inability to stay with a story is his undoing in this film. The story of Gil and Lana, two newlyweds who set out to take on the land starts out interestingly enough. And Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert, while not 100% convincing, do a nice enough job to convey the hardships of the times.It's only when Ford starts with his ""stable"" of stock, stereotype characters that the story becomes less about the adventure of a new family starting out during the birth of our country, and more about a lost episode of ""Hee Haw"".Ward Bond, Arthur Shields, Eddie Collins, and especially Edna May Oliver, should have never been anywhere near this film. Oliver, in particular is such a cartoon (especially in the scene where she refuses to get out of bed), I couldn't wait for her to get killed off.And of course, this being a John Ford film, the ""Indians"" come off worst of all. Just awful.What could have been a great story is wasted. At least it's a waste that looks beautiful."

Although according to interpretation view, every one has a peculiar and an individual realization of a text, but I 'd like to clarify my understanding of film's title; what are ""drums"" ?What does this word sign; the bell of the church or the march of the army?Remember that scene that Lana faced ,for the first time,with Blue Back, the Indian who lived friendly with nationalists . As Lana hadn't ever seen an Indian ,she feared when faced with a man with a strange color skin and strange traditional clothes .But "" Blue Back"" gave her a musical instrument, maybe a cane, for showing his friendly manner and reducing Lana' s fear of him. His instrument, was a traditional Indian one,I think, and therefore bestowing it to new comers who I call them new Americans, may be means that Indians(old Americans) trust the history to new Americans .&#61581; Hero women Considering the story of a rich girl who married with a farmer ,at first Lana had worn an expensive huge clothes and she was honor of her background as she liked an old pot which was belonged to her grandmother. And even ,when she faced with Blue Back for the first time ,she only cried and shouted for help ,but step by step she became a hero woman; she adjust herself with a rural life ,she learned farming and working at hand, she helped her husband, she was joyful, although she lost her house and her first child ,she was patient , she gave a birth to another child that was a sign of good future, she fought ,she helped soldiers, even she took up arms , she didn't fear death and at the end she became an independent woman as at the final scene she had worn a revolutionary army coat. So after losing the old pot which was an honorable sign of her background, she didn't become angry because she began to write a new history in new world, in Mohawk , in New York, in America.Therefore Lana was the representative of all Americans ,although she was a woman and although in reality all American women didn't have an effective role in revolutionary era as Lana.So this film shows the impact of war on changing the role of women in early history of the U.S .&#61582; Indian and Savage Indians In the whole of the film the only Indian that wasn't shown as a savage is Blue Back, although Lana for the first time that Blue Back appeared , was so frightened because in Lana 's point of view he had an uncommon image .But during the film he was the only Indian that had converted to Christianity, spoke English although not fluently and assimilated Americans and therefore hasn't been shown as a savage. But other Indians who were allies of Tories , were savage ,they only shouted and made strange sounds ,they had been shown as humans with no culture.&#61583; A person with Black eye patch ;Either an Indian or an EnemyOnly two people in this film wore black eye patch; first one of the Tories, second Blue Back. However what does a person with a black eye patch look like? Undoubtedly a pirate , and a pirate is a wicked . As Indians had been shown as savages , Tories like pirates and even the Blue Back who assimilated whites had been shown like pirates too, so the only good people in this film are white revolutionaries. Therefore American exceptional ism is obvious in director 's view. Ronald Steel(Steel:1995) explains exceptional ism sentiment in referring to the American film hero well :"" The American film hero is a lonely fighter for civilization, for society, for virtue. He uses harsh means to achieve good, employs force not for its own sake but for a morally higher goal."" And this statement is devoted to all revolutionaries in this film and this means this statement isn't devoted to Tories and Indians.&#61584; Colonist for Colonist Another wonderful scene is about Mrs. McKlennar ,when Indians fought and attacked her house, she refused to leave her bed and fought face to face against the Indians ,she was ready to sacrifice her life in order to save her bed ,she had accepted homicide. But although the film clarifies how colonists were concerned about their family and their community, this scene breaks this image because Mrs. McKlennar wasn't concerned about Lana and other members of house, she was worried about her bed ,therefore her individual benefits. This scene in fact explains the role of individualism in construction of a new America.&#61585; A Christain Is A soldier Remembering the speech of Arthur Shields ,a priest who invited all men from sixteen to sixty to military serve and alerted : '' any man failing to report to duty will be promptly hanged "". This is the story of church and army at that era. A Christian means a militant and diverse .So we face the parallelism of duty and faith. Through this way Mohawk nationalists formed an army and at the end, the American flag was placed upon the church . &#61586; Ignoring Black DiscriminationIf we look more carefully, we find out that every person in this movie except children are fighting ; white, Indian and even the only black person in this movie who is a servant ,is fighting and happy because of victory. But the director didn't say anything about discrimination against black at that period."
51,Drums Along the Mohawk,5,9 November 2016,Eastern Western,"Lana Borst, the daughter of a wealthy family, marries a young farmer named Gilbert Martin and goes to live on his small farm on the frontier. At first Lana, who is accustomed to living in luxury, hates frontier life, but her love for Gilbert is strong enough to help her adjust, and she settles down to their life together until their farm is destroyed by an Indian raiding party. The Martins are forced to accept work on the farm of a wealthy neighbour, the widowed Mrs. McKlennar, and during a brief period of peace they are able to rebuild their farm and start a family. When war returns to the area, Gilbert joins a local militia and fights bravely for his country. Eventually, facing a major attack by Indians and a few renegade white men, the settlers are forced to take refuge in a nearby fort. Just when it seems that the fort will be overrun, American soldiers come to the rescue, and all ends happily with the Stars and Stripes proudly flying.That could easily be the plot of a standard Western, no doubt directed by John Ford. ""Drums along the Mohawk"", however, is what might be called an Eastern Western, that is to say a standard Western shifted two thousand miles to the east and a hundred years back in time. The above story takes place not in the Texas or the Utah or the South Dakota of the 1870s but in upstate New York during the 1770s, in fact against the background of the American War of Independence. (It is, however, nevertheless directed by John Ford).Now anyone with any historical knowledge will be aware that the American War of Independence was so called because the Americans were fighting for independence from Britain, but you would not realise that from this film, which does not feature a single British character. There are a few villainous Tories (in the sense of pro-British American Loyalists, not members of the British Conservative Party), but the main villains are the Indians. The reason doubtless lies in the year the film was made, 1939. With war looming, Ford was doubtless uncomfortably aware that an anti-British movie could have been interpreted as pro-isolationist or, worse, pro-Nazi. Not all Americans in 1939 believed that they could remain permanently neutral if war came to Europe, and Ford might have been unwilling to offend citizens of a country alongside whose forces American troops might soon be fighting.Seen from 2016 as opposed to 1939, however, Ford's treatment of the Indians looks far more offensive than any treatment of colonial-era Britons could ever have been. (Indeed, it is a lot more offensive than his treatment of Indians in some of his later Westerns from the forties, fifties and sixties). The white settlers frequently refer to them by such choice epithets as ""pagans"", ""savages"" and ""brutes"", and it is clear that we are meant to take these descriptions as objective statements of fact, not as racist insults, because that is exactly how the Native Americans are portrayed- brutal, savage, and motivated only by bloodlust. There is no attempt to analyse why the Indians of this period should have harboured such enmity towards the whites or why they might have favoured the British rather than the Revolutionaries, but any American viewers wanting an answer to these questions ought to read their own Declaration of Independence, which makes it quite clear that the sentiment ""all men are created equal"" did not extend to the non-white races.The only ""good Indian"" is Chief Blue Back, a Christian convert who has partially adopted the white man's ways and learnt to speak English after a fashion and who sides with the Revolutionaries. Ford doubtless intended us to see Blue Back as sympathetic, but from a modern point of view he looks more like a patronising caricature. A real Blue Back would probably have been more pathetic than sympathetic, a lonely, isolated figure cut off from his own people and their culture by his religious conversion and patronised, but never treated as an equal, by the whites among whom he lived.The acting is not particularly distinguished. Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert in the two leading roles are adequate, but in neither case is this their finest hour. The supporting characters, however, tend towards the one-dimensional, not only Blue Back but also Arthur Shields' garrulous clergyman and the irritatingly formidable-but lovable Mrs. McKlennar. (Edna May Oliver seemed to specialise in irritatingly formidable-but-lovable old ladies; she even managed to portray Lady Catherine de Burgh as such in ""Pride and Prejudice"" the following year). The film's one saving grace is its visual attractiveness; it was Ford's first colour film at a time when most Westerns were made in black-and-white. 1939 was the year in which Ford directed one of the great Westerns of all time, ""Stagecoach"", but ""Drums along the Mohawk"" is in nothing like the same class. 5/10"
52,Drums Along the Mohawk,10,31 January 2014,An under-appreciated masterpiece,"A recent viewing of John Ford's historical drama of the American revolution, ""Drums Along the Mohawk,"" prompts me to try to persuade you what an under-appreciated masterpiece it is, epitomizing the master at his best in frontier dramas. Sure it's got all the stock Ford elements, not just cast and company, but repetitious cultural details to convey the flavor of the frontier era. (Had he been able to script Henry Fonda doing the same bumpkin dance step he does in ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", ""My Darling Clementine"", and ""Fort Apache"" with any credibility to the era, I'm sure he would havebut that just proves my point.)I say under-appreciated because DATM is the best of the 1939 movies, and one of the greatest of all time, despite its ridiculously paltry 7.2 IMDb rating. It's trite but a truism that you can discover something new in every viewing, some small detail that evokes your admiration.This was one of the first films in Technicolor and Ford showed a mastery of it, even though he plied his trade almost exclusively in black and white, with great artistic skill, for years after. His use of location shooting, especially the wide shots that include sky and background, and contrast demonstrates his understanding of the medium while it was still in its infancy. Claudette Colbert was said to have terrible misgivings about being photographed in color but she is luminous here in many scenes. Ford understood imagery as well as any great filmmaker.Space prevents using more than a few examples to support the point, but try these. The outdoor scene in which the Indians attack Gil's farm is breathtakingly brilliant, both in detail and totality of imagery: angles, colors, contrasts, close-ups, long shots, lighting, costuming, dialog, action, and editingall perfectly designed and executed. Blue Back breathes heavily as if he had just run for miles, a step head of the Indians unseen in the menacingly shadowed woods just behind him. Caldwell and his men appear in a sun-dappled clearing with smoke drifting through it, foreshadowing what is about to happen to the farm, and the effect is haunting. The next time you watch this film, look at the lower right corner of that scene's opening long shot. Mary Reall can be seen bringing John Weaver a drink of water. It's their first appearance in the movie, well before the minor plot detail of their marriage is even suggested and the touch of a master. How in the world did it even occur to Ford to include it, knowing that 99.99% of his audience would never notice? A similar detail during the barn-raising scene in ""Witness"" is central to that shot. Did you notice it here, Peter Weir?DATM is crammed with such scenes. Gil marching off with to the Battle of Oriskany (which BTW is unerringly conveyed to the frontier enthusiast without ever using its name) is equally memorable, from Fonda's admirably underplayed intimate parting from Lana and Mrs. McKlennar to the broad vista of Lana sitting like Andrew Wyeth's Christina (and preceding that masterpiece by almost ten yearsanother coincidence? Probablyit would be interesting though to learn the derivation of Ford's vision) watching the army march across the valley. Every time I see the shot of the New York Continentals shuffling up the dusty road, I get a feeling I'm looking through a window back into history. At the end of that scene look across the valley with Lana and watch a gaggle of horsemen break away from the head of the distant marching line to review the force as it marches by  another perfect touch in miniature.Not all of the best shots are grand in scope or even intentional. The scene inside the McKlennar house when the exhausted and decimated army returns from Oriskany has a stage play feel to it but is no less brilliant. The waiting women sit outside on the porch on a sultry August night (a small point of accuracy) with Mrs McKlennar trying to cool herself with a fan because the house is still too hot inside. After the army returns, militia Captain Mark Demooth sits unrecognizable on the porch in battle shock, unable to speak or respond to Mrs. McKlennar, who caresses his cheek in appreciation of the horror he has experienced. Of the unplanned brilliance, the battle itself was cut from production for time and budget reasons, with a jerry-rigged monologue by Fonda substituted, but the result is far more effective than a battle scene would have been. Fonda understates his description of the battle, conveying it so well that Colbert responds with a sudden look of horror as he describes the memory of seeing a neighbor get his head shot off, a look so fleeting that you almost have to pause the film to see how well she renders it.All of this is accomplished with the Ford craftsmanship we take for granted. His period pieces are so well done that he puts you back into the era using a stock company of actors basically portraying themselves (contrasted to the casting of any of innumerable and interchangeable pretty person clones so integral to filmmaking today) and costumes, makeup and sets that are authentic enough to avoid the feel of a Hollywood back lot. Compare that to today's films with their contrived uglinessexcessively ill-fitting clothing, bad hairdos, and garish makeupmeant to show us that these were the ""old times"" when the unwashed didn't have the enlightened sense of beauty and sex appeal we're so privileged to enjoy today. If you haven't seen ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" yet, give it a look, and even if you have, give it another, a more critical one."
53,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,27 January 2014,"""I didn't want to hit you - - I HAD to do it . . . """,". . . Gilbert ""Gil"" Martin (Henry Fonda) tells his bride Lana (Claudette Colbert) on the second night of their honeymoon, after smacking her across the face. This is a marriage screaming out loud for more ""back story;"" namely, exactly HOW did log cabin bumpkin Gil even meet city mansion dweller Lana? It's as if THE GREAT GATSY did not show us how Jay Gatz met Daisy Buchanan when he was poor at a military USO-style dance, or like ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS failing to show that he did NOT go directly from a log cabin to wedded ""bliss"" with Mary Todd, but had become a prominent lawyer during the interim period. Furthermore, I've always wondered why some of the teachers at my school seem to pick on the kids who have ""Mohawk"" haircuts. Turns out most of the faculty seem old enough to have watched DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK in actual movie theaters when it first came out, during their younger, more impressionable years. In a somewhat racist depiction, all the Native Americans here (except one) are wearing the ORIGINAL Mohawk hair style, and all they seem to do is whoop in high pitched giggles while burning down crops and houses in the New York river valley named after them. While the settler homes may not have had electricity and TV's, no Mohawk homes are shown at all--implying that this tribe was homeless, like today's war veterans suffering from PTSD. My question is, Who would have been dumb enough to burn these crops, cabins, and lodges?! They could have just gathered the crops and moved into the habitations, or used them as second homes, at least. Since the river and valley already were in the Mohawk's name, who could have objected? The U.S. Constitution, which says ""possession is nine-tenths of the law,"" was fresher in peoples' minds then than now. My late dog was named Herkimer, after a town that my family once visited in New York, which--it turns out--was named after a general who gets his leg cut off in DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK and dies. ""Herky"" ate too many bunnies in our yard, dying from that; before he expired, he'd do a superstitious multi-lap one-dog race around a tree near our driveway every time we backed out a car, to insure that someone would return home to continue feeding him. Eventually ""Herky's Oval"" was carved four inches into the ground. Henry Fonda is shown out-running a trio of Native Americans who are wearing attire more appropriate for Marathoning than Henry's cumbersome fringed leathers in DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK, which I find a trifle hard to credit. I just KNOW Herky would have run circles around Henry."
54,Drums Along the Mohawk,9,25 November 2013,Just a couple of historical opinions based on research,"Ford left out an important topic about the American Revolution in the Mohawk Valley. The topic being that it was a theater of extreme neighbor on neighbor violence. Colonial Patriots, Loyalists and Iroquois all who once lived together in peace were split because of politics. The patriots were so harsh on the Loyalist about their beliefs to a point were many Loyalists left the valley for Canada or England. The Iroquois original wanted no part in the conflict. I do believe that the word vengeance for what the Patriots put the loyalists through can be valid. I think British officials and John Johnson wanted to assign those loyal to the crown who knew and lived in the area to attack the Patriots. Many of the New York Loyalist and Iroquois enlisted were part of the Kings Royal Regiment of New York, and Butlers Rangers. I mostly believe that it was the British objective to lay waste to the valley for two reasons. One, The Mohawk valley was a major food source for the Continental Army up until after the Sullivan Expedition of 1779. Two, St. Ledger wanted to provide a diversion to help Burgoyne at Saratoga. We do not see the worst of it because the film goes from 1777 to early 1779. From 1780 to the end of the war there were a lot more raids with smaller raiding parties containing mostly of Loyalists from the area. By the end of the war the valley was practically deserted with lots of destroyed homesteads and farms. Some settlements and small villages were wiped from the face of the earth like Andrustown. Only less than a 1000 out of about 7000 residents remained. Even though other frontier communities faced the same events like Cobleskill, and Cherry Valley, the devastation according to accounts was not as near as what it was in the Mohawk Valley. Repeated battles and raids made the Mohawk Valley the most bloodiest and dangerous place during the War for Independence. It took the lives of many innocent Patriots, Loyalist, and Iroquois. I do like the film and Ford did a good job showing frontier life and a good portrayal of the 1778 attack."
55,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,12 May 2013,Beware thy heathen in thine breast.,"Drums Along the Mohawk is directed by John Ford and adapted to screenplay by Sonya Levien & Lamar Trotti from the novel written by Walter D. Edmonds. It stars Henry Fonda, Claudette Colbert, Edna May Oliver, John Carradine and Ward Bond. Music is by Alfred Newman and cinematography by Bert Glennon and Ray Rennahan. Settlers on the New York frontier face up to the challenges of the Revolution and hostile forces homing in on their settlements. In what was a stellar year for cinema, John Ford had three films released, Stagecoach, Young Mr. Lincoln and Drums Along the Mohawk, of the three it's not unfair to say that the latter is seen as the lesser light of his 1939 output. Yet this in no way means it's a weak film, it isn't, although it has some problems, it's just a measure of the director that he was able to churn out quality more often than not. Drums Along the Mohawk is very much a quintessential Ford movie, it's awash with sentiment, an awareness of the value of community and of course some muscular love of America. The attention to detail of frontier life - and the knowledge of the folk who fought in that first wave of the Revolution - is superb, boosted no end by the magnificent Technicolor (it was Ford's first film in colour) and the way Glennon and Rennahan (Oscar Nominated Best Color Cinematography) bring the Utah landscapes vividly to life. The story allows Ford to produce some great moments. A battle scarred Gilbert Martin (Fonda) musing on the horrors of war holds the viewer spellbound, the edge of seat attack on Fort Herkimer that closes the picture excites and frightens in equal measure, and a chase sequence that sees Gil pursued by three Mohawks is a thing of beauty as it begins under a blood red sky and continues through the changing landscape. It's a film showcasing the strengths of the director for sure. On the acting front the ever watchable Fonda and the Ford stock company are let down a touch by the odd casting of Colbert. Bright and cute in that Bonnet wearing kind of way, Colbert is miscast and never fully convinces as a frontier wife, though she is not helped by scripted dialogue that often borders on being twee. No such problem with Oliver, though, who is delightful as the crotchety and stoic old gal, her Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress was well warranted. Some misplaced humour, Colbert and twee dialogue stop it from being ultimate Ford, but it's often a thing of beauty and it has knowledge and warmth driving the narrative forward. 7/10"
56,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,9 June 2012,Eye Candy,"The biggest star here is the cinematography. The daylight exteriors are as luscious as it gets. Someone really had a feel for time and place in this one. Sets and set dressing are exquisite as well, with a real colonial feel, gritty and rough-hewn. Superb Technicolor. Of the stars, a youthful, gangly Henry Fonda is exuberant and innocent. Claudette Colbert is a little old for this role, but she pulls it off magnificently, giving a little touch of ""robbing the cradle"". A troupe of great character actors, including Ward Bond and Edna Oliver, round out the subtext. The result is an engaging, rollicking Technicolor romp that delivers the entertainment goods."
57,Drums Along the Mohawk,8,11 March 2010,Drums Along the Mohawk,"I could not believe this story is about war history because the movie began with the scene of the beautiful wedding. Besides, there were many soft musics that performed in the beginning. I thought this movie would have been the romantic movie. However, this movie attracted me because it introduced the life of people in rural. I watched many movies ,but they usually were about the life of people in urban, so it was like I learned another taste of movies. It was natural. Moreover, The scene that was about the war was exciting because there were a lot of shooting and using many kinds of weapon. A lot of people were used to perform the scene of the war that helps the audience get the feeling of war. In addition ,it was a good opportunity to learn the strategy of the war in that era. Another scene that I like when the three indians was chasing the main actor, and they were running on the mountain on the background of the sunrise. It helps me imagine this is very long running. Nevertheless, I think there is the problem of the color of the movie because I could not see the detail in far vision."
58,Drums Along the Mohawk,6,10 November 2009,Drums Along the Mohawk,"Drums Along the Mohawk is the first Technicolor film for class that I have seen so far. I'm not sure how I feel about it. It seemed like the colors were a little too bright, like Lana's lips and dress. But, the views of the clouds and the sky were magnificent and added much to these scenes. Otherwise, I don't see how the color enhanced the feel of the movie. There were simple uses of light and dark, such as dark and rain when there were troubles and sun and blue skies when things were okay. There were many surprising deaths, I was surprised when the widow was killed and when the preacher killed the character who the Indians were going to burn alive. At the start of this movie, I really didn't think such bad things would happen. The story was too melodramatic at points."
59,Drums Along the Mohawk,9,4 March 2009,Chief John Big Tree twice,"The only thing I never liked about John Ford is his constant re-use of stuff. I guess using the same crew for nearly every film is good, ala ""Ocean's 11"" etc, but why would you have Chief John Big Tree utter the same exact line in two films years apart. He first (that we know of since his first film was in 1915) the Chief uttered the line ""I'm a Christian Indian, Hallalueja"" in a very vivid way. Years later toward the end of the film ""She wore a yellow ribbon"" a much older and more tired Chief John Big Tree utters the same line to John Wayne ""nathan I'm a Christian Indian, Hallalueja."" Same guy, same line, uttered in the same way. I never understood this. Scorsece does it with a scene of Robert Deniro in Mean Streets and again in Goodfellows. Not the words here but the scene at the bar with him doing a turn and look to the music. what if it doesn't work the first time you try it again to perfect it? Bob"
60,Drums Along the Mohawk,,7 March 2008,Good Ford,"Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) *** (out of 4) Minor John Ford film with Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert getting married and trying to grow a pretty farm but it's destroyed by bloodthirsty and evil savages (Ford's showing of Indians) so the husband takes arms and fights them off. This is somewhat interesting as it's a Western mixed with the Revolutionary War but this is part of the problem. It seems on one end Ford wanted an epic dealing with the war but it just came off as one crazy man (John Carradine) and a bunch of bloodthirsty Indians. I'm one who defends the ""racism"" in The Searchers but the Indians here seemed pretty mean spirited, which gave the film a rather one sided view of everything. Even the performances seemed a bit minor but you can't expect Fonda to be brilliant in everything he does. He remains interesting to watch but again, I wouldn't call this one of his greatest performances. The scenery is terrific and the Technicolor gives plenty to look at."
61,Drums Along the Mohawk,6,11 December 2007,"Is this a John Ford, a Howard Pyle, or an N.C. Wyeth picture?","Ford accomplished something stunning -- he's out of his own exalted league, really -- with the look and feel of this film. Almost every frame is a Technicolor-drenched pictorial tribute to the golden age of boys' adventure-story illustration, an era crowned by the lush, densely detailed book and magazine work of Pyle and Wyeth, which was fading away just as Hollywood got the pictures ""moving"" in the 1910s. None of the John Wayne-John Ford films I've seen, not even ""The Quiet Man,"" is as compelling visually as this movie, which comes as close to delivering 24 frames a second of tableaux vivants or Saturday Evening Post covers as anything ever projected onto a screen.A few of the performers are good, notably Claudette Colbert (a tad more disheveled than usual) and Edna May Oliver (much warmer and more endearing than ever). Most of the other talent, even Fonda's, is wasted in the service of dreadful, endless clichés about jug liquor, savage savages, love of the flag, good guys outrunning bad guys, preachers taking up muskets for Jesus, even an African-American servant who seems to be there merely as a perk of the two stars' top billing. Ford makes a much better director than a history teacher, and it frosts me that so many American moviegoers won't or can't see the difference.All 6 of my stars are for the cinematography, costumes, lighting, blocking, and every other ingredient of the gorgeous set pieces of ""Drums."" The story, sad to say, just blows."
62,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,10 December 2007,It's Quiet Out There -- Too Quiet.,"It's an exciting frontier adventure story, starring Henry Fonda, Claudette Colbert, and the rest of the stock company of director John Ford. Supposedly in the Mohawk Valley of upstate New York, it was actually filmed in Utah's Wasatch Mountains, in stupendiferous, colossal, formidable, transmogrifying Technicolor. What photography! You could almost ignore the story of two newlyweds trying to build a farm, fend off Indians and share in the élan of the community, and just goggle at the viridian spruce trees and the devil's-hoof-marked bone-white poplar trunks and the azure sky and the ochre corn and the burnt umber skin of the treacherous Indians who join the Tories during the Revolutionary War.It does what a lot of period movies don't do. It shows you what hard work really is. Not one or two perfunctory shots of a man swinging an ax, but rather extended scenes of the entire population hard at it, clearing the fields, putting up the barn.It's an unmistakably Fordian movie. It has all his major ceremonies and minor rituals -- birth, marriage, death, dancing, church services, a desperate defense of the Fort. And -- most notably -- a foot race in which Fonda runs as fast as he can with three Indians in hot pursuit. Fonda is running not just for his life, but to reach Fort MacDonald and bring back help to save the rest of the community. We've all seen foot chases before, if we've seen any recent action movies. And they're all souped up. Guys dodge cars on city streets, leap over garbage cans, jump from rooftop to rooftop, knock their way through crowds of pedestrians, clamber down fire escapes. But this one is different. It doesn't depend on strategy. There are no racks of clothing or 50 gallon drums for the pursued to topple over behind him. Nobody shoots at anybody else. It depends entirely on stamina and speed, through some thickets, but mostly over flat open ground. It's like watching an Olympic marathon. (Does Fonda outrun the Indians and save the town? No power on earth could get me to answer.) Ford captures character with his usual aplomb. Edna Mae Oliver is superb as the homely, elderly widow who misses her husband without moaning about it and who flirts only half-kiddingly with the robust Ward Bond. Claudette Colbert had a pretty good career in Hollywood, without being notably attractive, sexy, or talented. Ford doesn't do her any favors here. She faints so many times I couldn't count them. Or, maybe, once or twice, she simply collapses while retaining consciousness. And there is a dramatic scene of amputation and death involving a character we've come to know and respect. There is some noticeable overacting too, which was always one of Ford's several weaknesses. When the women of the community pour pots of boiling water on attacking Indians, we really don't expect them to giggle and laugh.Ford was a first-rate director and made some films that stand among the best, given the sentiments and limitations of the period, and this probably isn't one of them. Still, it's head and shoulders above today's mechanical products."
63,Drums Along the Mohawk,,18 April 2007,"The film that in, shifting from men's power of construction towards women","When it has been supposed one nation with its artificial cultural boundaries create or birth, their making history should be lightening (President Wilson).so Hollywood helps making history when movies have played an enormous part in giving us a sense of our history (American Heritage Magazine). The interesting point of ""Drums along The Mohawk"" is shifting from men's power of construction towards women. In other words, not only the film represents the concerns of American frontier man about their community but also concentrates on the intrepidity and bravery of frontier women in defending their society. The other point in representing American frontier's life is the attention paid to the importance of church by featuring it repeatedly during the film and the impact of Christianity in changing characteristics of an Indian who assists Gill's group against other Indians.Despite of this good aspect of movie, in my opinion the context of film has been formed by Indian American stereotype as brutal or stupid persons who can be used as instruments by the whites; the film has been an effort to include some aspects of ""White Supremacy"" theory and even covertly Christian supremacy. It is necessary to add this point as well that White Supremacy is a racist ideology which holds the belief that white people are superior to other races Any way, According to critics especially Indians themselves John Ford who produced many racist anti-Indian films ever made in Hollywood( Ward Churchill) like ""The Searchers"" (1956), some sequence of ""Drums along the Mohawk"" in despising the position of Indians has been expected. . White Supremacy often refers to anti-Black racism but it has also been used to justify prejudice and discrimination against other non-white groups, such as American Indians. (wikipedia)What is meant by White Supremacy in this case is that whites are not only superior to others, but they want to rule over inferior non-white peoples as we see the hegemony of whites upon Indian warriors."
64,Drums Along the Mohawk,5,14 January 2007,This is a story of struggle for survival between two races and how some like Redcoats try to use it for their interests.,"AnalysisThe film is produced in 1939,when world war II started in Europe, when Americans passed through hard times of depression, when Americans gradually forgot their patriotic sense of eighteen and nineteen centuries and went into capitalism modern sense of individualism. John Ford wants to narrate the sense patriotism through a narrowed focus on small part of American Revolution against British Kingdom. According its level, film could show appropriately the hard times of American revolutionary war as well as the problems of settlers as frontiers. Ford shows through how hard events Americans could build their nation, but this is an American point of view and it is unilateral as well. It seems they have forgotten that they occupied Indians' land, so it's Indians' right to defend themselves against aggressors. If Ford wanted to have fair look at the case, he should portray some scenes among Indians and inquired why they were so aggressive toward settlers, although he shows that redcoats had provoked Indians. Gil and Lana represent young nation to seek stability in new world. Lana, like most of women among frontier families, according to history book such as the American promise, does not like to live such horrible place at first, because she has not seen yet such an incident, as she is from urban society, but in last scene you see her as a soldier, even kills an Indian came into church. The final scene includes some meanings; first, as messenger says General Washington has won the war against British and invites settlers to consider the new flag. Second, as old Indian salutes the flag, we can find that Indians in eastern and north eastern coasts of U.S have lost their lands and defeated. From now on, Indians look and live as marginalized groups, of course in eastern coast. Third, as new government is established by General Washington, as president and his successors, they triggered for the westward movement. Although, I'm not expert in technical aspects of cinematography, but I should assert technical privileges given to this film, in terms of color and special effects that I think, according to that time, are masterpiece. Use of color and light as well as sound effect according to plot is excellent. Using Technicolor in this film is new for movies in 1939.In this year some blockbusters were produced such as ""Gone with the wind"". There is no any flash back just old Mrs. Mc Kennar remembers her husband when he went to fight ""those men"", British or Indians she does not mention. Henry Fonda presents his role very good, as young man who is earnest and energetic about his aim that is to live and cultivate in frontier lands. His figure matches his role. Claudette Colbert, as Lana, plays good as a frontier woman who is very sentimental at first but events make her resistant.Individualism in the WildernessAs a sign of individualism, this era of American history is the rush time of individuals to live in frontier lands. The seventeenth and eighteenth century in Europe is the start of ideas about human's right that, finally, led to main revolutions in America and France. The idea of liberalism came in parallel with individualism. The idea that caused, later, many debates about individuals and states' rights and freedom among American revolutionary leaders. Many Europeans fled from persecution of religious officials and feudalism came in America for better and convenient life, without knowledge about what was happening there between pioneers and Indians. Thus, the conflict was inevitable with natives who were removed from their ancestral lands. Many emigrants experiencing individualism by bearing hard condition, they could construct a very and the only liberal society in world. Individualism as an experience learned them that they could not be triumphant without being together, so they gathered under one flag, flag of the United States. Technically, the film is well-made and one of excellent movies that I have ever watched from past, although I think we, student of American studies, only can watch these type of movies ,with this kind of quality and censorship, in this unique Institute. Historically, it is about the formation of American united nation, a nation which started individually and, even though, it led to unity but Individualism continued through nineteenth and twentieth century toward Modernism and kept its impacts by some social outcomes such as nuclear families, as some anthropologists like Susan Rogers believe. (Ulin, Understanding Culture, chapter nine) According to Americans' view of Indians, the movie had been successful to transmit the sense of fear and hate to Indians as well as British, as main enemies of American progress."
65,Drums Along the Mohawk,,14 January 2007,Attempt of the young couple for making their new life in Drums Along the Mohawk is the symbol of American identity (late 18th century),"Some of young girls sometimes think about their future life very dramatically, the dream of one gentleman who goes with his white horse and bring her away in a beautiful palace. Drums Along the Mohawk didn't destroy this dream but completed it, or cleared it, the people who are going to be Lady and Gentleman during their hard life and building their palace together. At the first they joined to each with spouse that love is enough, but living in settlements was not so individual, they need to their neighbors! So they trust to the other families around themselves, but this was not enough too they have to joined to bigger society, the American new society, they have to united under the American flag. Gilbert Martin and his bride Lana marry shortly before the revolutionary war starts. They settle in Upstate New York and began their couple life with hope. Something like communication with neighbors was strange for them especially Lana but the series problems like Indian attacks resulted to burned out their village with intriguing Tories. So for the next six years Gilbert fights in the war as he and Lana try to establish their homestead. Alfred Newman is the composer of this film, he entered films with the 1930 Goldwyn production Whoopee. Nominated for 45 Academy awards, Newman won the award nine times. His last composition was the driving, intensely up-to-date main theme for Universal's Airport (1970). Also in 1995 he composed Hollywood Sound.In Mohawk, every situation has its music, with the background of hope or something that new couples feel it, sadness, happiness, expectation, patience, fear and confusion , are some of these situation that Alfred Newman composed it artistically. Claudette Colbert the actress of this film was born in Paris, Seine, France. Her first successful film was The Lady Lies in (1929) and she could accept her started situation in American cinema in 1930s, such unique situation that her name symbolized good movies in America.  Mohawk (1939) was her film that kept fans coming to the theaters and the movie moguls happy. By the late 1940s and early 1950s she was not only seen on the screen but the infant medium of television, where she appeared in a number of programs.We could consider her different play in this film, her different conditions like, at the beginning of film, when enter to life with a man, and after that when she migrated with her husband to new place and etc. in these times we could see her in timid lady role but with passed another film's events, she received to brave woman who could take a weapon and protected of her neighbors in lake of her husband! So Claudette Colbert believed this role and played it. Henry Fonda was born in Grand Island (1905). His ancestors came from Genoa, Italy, and fled to the Netherlands around 1400. He started his acting Debut with the Omaha Community Playhouse, a local amateur theater troupe directed by Dorothy Brando. One of his best films was Young Mr. Lincoln (1939); His two children are screen stars of American Cinema today. He finally died in 12 August 1982.A kind of pride and self confidence is obvious in his face, it seems that he could manage the problem even when he came back from war and he was very upset of it, another thing that he live with all of his energy and war was not only conflict for him, he fought for his life. In all of the film Henry Fonda didn't distance from his role.John Ford (I), was born in Maine (1894) he was one of the most respected directors in the business especially in his westerns, which were not considered ""serious"" film. He won six Oscars and received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from Richard Nixon in 1973.He has won more directing Oscars than any other director: four times! He also won an Oscar for Best Documentary, Short Subject for The Battle of Midway (1942) and an Oscar for Best Documentary.It seems that John Ford (I) was successful to direct a historian Film. In regard of American narrative of their history, they try to build their house, their city and their country and they are not only immigrants but also they are creators of this land and this history. So this film could give this belief that every group of immigrants (the young couple) who came to this land for their interest, finally joined to his society and his United Nation. Ford could portray it during the film and ended it in unity of settlements when the flag was raised. American Society in Late Eighteen CenturyTom Tyler (Capt. Morgan), Chief John Big Tree (Blue Back) and Edna May Oliver (Mrs. Sarah McKlennar) are the best representative of this society, Capt. Morgan who is introduced with his single eye, wanted to keep Tories' domination on settlements, in fact he wanted to access to this land. Mrs. Sarah McKlennar who is introduced with her naked language has role of respectable land owner even in lake of her husband (General McKlennar) and she doesn't leave her land, her home, her bed until last moment! Blue Back, the Indian man who is introduced with his ancient hat, his broken English accent and his emphasis on putting the hat could be a sign for trying to keep his Indian culture and keep situation in new American society. These three representatives in the time shortly before American Revelation (1776) are good choice for showing some challenges in American History and American Identity. The central role of this new couple also helps to perceive the new society better. May be this couple were representative of common American people that try to find their place in new society and in this way they had to accept some prices."
66,Drums Along the Mohawk,,13 January 2007,This historical film depicted revolutionary era of American history in the late 18th century and all the challenges between Indians and Americans.,"Drums along the Mohawk was directed by John ford in 1939 and won two Academic rewards for best supporting actress and best Cinematography. This historical film basically is depicting revolutionary era of American in 1776 and the problems of Americans with Tories, the Indian Allies of British Army in the territory of Mohawk River. With this basic theme, the story is started with the marriage of Gil Martin(Henry Fonda), a war-era farmer with a well born women Lana (Claudette Colbert). The film from the beginning showed the process of their Shared life which is simultaneous with Indians invasions to Mohawk. To start their life, they moved to Dorr field, Close to Mohawk in a cabin built by Gil. During the story we see how these two and other neighbors are engaging to defend their land from Indians invasion and the changes that happened to their family role during the wars. Men joined the army and moved to frontier for defending the lands and women stayed at home to take care of children and nursing the war injured. Indians invasions were showed too much cruel and savagery and Americans lost their home,farming lands and properties. Blue Back was the only Indian in this film who was with Americans and was spying for them about Indians attacks. Lana and Gil found a job in Mrs. McKlennars house. She was very serious but kind and caring widow. Lana during the war gave birth to a son and a Mother Role added to her responsibilities. Their family formation became more completed as we move on threw the end of the film.At last they move backed to their territory to build up their Cabin again and the Americans could defeated Indians and made a unity of 13 sates of America. The film ended with showing American Flag which impressed the belonging sense to Americans as a united nation.In this film American society at that time was based on agriculture, men and women both worked on the farms, rich families had black slaves. Politics was very important to people. And the soon they got to know each other they asked about their affiliation to political parties. Everything was collective and no individualism existed. Because it was a crisis era and Americans needed to be united for defeating their subjugation under British colonization. While running away they helped each other to be safe. This film was produced in 1939. This is by the way that in 1930s the Production Code wrote by Jesuit Priest and a catholic Layman as a list of could and could not depict in Hollywood movies. Not only political themes and acts of graphic violence to be censored but issues of sex and sexuality in the movies were strictly monitored. Even the couples sexual relationship was prohibited to be depicted. That is why in this film you could easily feel the traces of production code. Gil and Lana's relation is limited in front of the camera. Christianity in this film is very salient. For church was one of those important and central institutions in the Mohawk's people's life. Marriage took place there and even important news and declaration of unity for fighting against Indians was announced there. A drum along the Mohawk has a war, Adventure and western Genre. Western because Americans were fighting against Indians and tried to remove the wilderness. Characters Henry Fonda is the actor of Gil Marti role. He was named the sixth Greatest Male Star of All Time by the American Film Institute. Henry Fonda in this film was very brave, serious who cared about his country and family. Although he was a typical masculine character (patriarchal) but emotionally he was very depended to Lana (his wife) and needed her supports a lot. Claudette Colbert played Lana's role. This French American actress in 1939 was nominated the best actress of Academy Award in it happened one night. Colbert as Lana in Drums along the Mohawk was elegant, sensitive and well. In he beginning of the film she didn't know how to live like a frontier women and was not used to hard life. But as the story moved on and she could experience different situation and learned how be behave and how to support her husband by being strong. Edna may Oliver as Mrs. McKlennar was nominated Award Academy for her appearance in Drums along the Mohawk. During the 1930's, she was one of the American screen's best-known character actresses. In this film she behaved tough with men but the interior part of her characteristic was very supportive not just to Gil and Martin but to all her neighbors who were suffering of Indians invasion.While tow Indian invade her room and burned all her stuffs she was shouting at them and sitting on her bed that was her husbands memorial and didn't let them to burned it. This part of the film was very expressive. The bed was a symbol of the Americans sense of belonging to their land that Indians invaded it and wanted to remove them all. She was very supportive to Gil and Martin and at the time of her death she granted all her properties to them. Conclusion American exceptional ism was conceptualized in this film because Indians were depicted savage, cruel and violent people and Americans were shown as tractable. Americans didn't invade Indians unless Indians did it first. All Americans did was a reaction to Indians savagery. Drums along the Mohawk was very unilateral film that tried to depict Indians as savage and non civilized. This is by the way that Americans very cruel to them as well during the history. History is a fair document to judge about Americans and Indians. Americans had also made many troubles for Indians such as cultural, economical and political problems. Many of them were killed by Americans, their culture was manipulated by them, they were removed form their original lands. Trial of tears in 1833 showed the Americans cruel policies against Indians."
67,Drums Along the Mohawk,,10 January 2007,It is a movie about the burden the first generation took to build up America. However it is narrated by Whites.,"Drums along the Mohawk I,as MA student of American cultural studies,Tehran university watched the movie accompanying my classmates.It was a great help to review the history cource for the time before the Revolution. The movie is produced in 1939 by John Ford. He won Oscar for four times besides many other awards. His other famous movies such as Gone with the Wind, Mr. Lincoln, How Green was My Valley and The Grapes of Wrath are all world famous. The theme looks common among them are the history and adventure. The story of Drums along the Mohawk was derived from Walter D.Edmands, however it was rewritten for several times by Sonya Levien and Lamart Trotti.It also got Oscar prize for the color and the best actress in supporting role. Its main characters are Lana and Gilbert played by Claudette Colbert and Henry Fonda. Colbert had played more than forty movies and she won the Oscar prize for ""It Happened One Night"". Fonda also is a famous actor in Hollywood who won Oscar for ""On Golden Pond"" in 1981. The time of the movie backs to the time before the revolution period. It starts with a wedding party. It is an agrarian society, so the young couples look for new chances in west, in Mohawk valley, where the Indian Territory locates. The couple and their neighbors try to make farms, cooperating closely. They are invaded by Indians who are intrigued by British. The man and his colleagues fight to demolish the Indians, but they return shattered. They are determined to start again,but they are invaded for the second time at their so-called home. The young man, running for one day, brings help from George Washington's army. Then people come safe and the country announces in dependency. It's a western movie with all the stereotypical features. These characteristics include the improving America due to white immigrants' hard work and advancement westward, the family life which starts in marriage, continues with their romance, bearing children and founding a union. The pious and virtuous community encounters native savages bravely and ultimately reaches success. The story lacks suspense, but its beautiful views are eye-catching. Especially its music by Alfred Newman gives a nice sense of romance, war and glory of a country to audience. The historic perspective of the movie backs to 1779 when British-descent Americans had divided into two groups, one pro-revolution and the other con-revolution called Tories. Tories were also called loyalists since they were loyal to the British kingdom. On the other hand, the Iroquois tribes whose territories were occupied by whites (the movie protagonists), cooperated and tempted by Tories to invade them. However the history shows that after America Independency, the British didn't even name them. Another interaction between whites and Indians is about Blue Back. He is an Indian integrated into whites. He is Christian, a church goer, speaks English and even during the war he is against other Indians. The director wants to depict, despite the fact the historian wrote, the Indians who adapted themselves to white civilization were accepted with open arms. Moreover, the movie can be a description of Washington's first armies. They started while they were not trained, professional soldiers. There were informal relationships among commanders and soldiers and they drank a lot. That's Washington who made them in order and leads them to have American flag in the territory with his policy for Indian extinction. Drums along the Mohawk is not as brilliant as other Ford's works but it can be an exact Hollywood product with all its stereotypical features."
68,Drums Along the Mohawk,,6 January 2007,Drums Along the Mohawk,"The entire movie is narrating historical events as it was although with exaggeration and some times going out of reality. It addresses the unbroken parts of America with its Indian inhabitants with the Term ""wilderness"" as the priest in the church prays for the couples. Or somewhere else the cross eyed man who is believed as Torries party's representative, indicates the hostility that they had against those who wanted independence of America in that period. The Indian blue back which is labeled so, because this name or literal translation caries his personality possibly as he was beaten black and blue by the whites to obey their law and religion. It implies that Indians even the best of them are not going to be civilized as we see he suggests a stick to domesticate the woman in the movie. Expressions like"" good Christian "" by blue back to the best shows the controversy in the movie that contrasts the stick using personality of them. The loose garment that covers all blue back's body is another indication of the fact that john ford accidentally or by purpose humiliates Indians and makes a giggly personality out of blue back's role. Holding the cap on the head while in church is another proof of impossibility of civilizing Indians as well as interruptions by expressions like ""halleluiah"" that Blue Back often uses. A love story is intricately mixed with the theme so that adds to the flavor of harshness in early America and from the view of the young married couple viewers fully taste how hard was American's struggles for independence, In fact by this trick the viewers' sense of sympathy is overwhelming their judging history. We never see in the history Indians burn the whites or frequently attack white with no excuse which threatens their existence, here John Ford again exaggerates the scene as the Indians are called savages who burn and kill the white settlers every often and as an example can burn Joe alive or pursue Gil for hours to kill him. Going to the church and emphasizing the role of the priest in revolutionizing the people says that Americans with the help of God could survive being in America while in the history there are much evidence that whites ignorantly kill Indians to get rid of their troubles as landowners not as invaders and often we find letters from indigenous people which refers Americans to preserve their religious obligations and not to murder or remove Indians as once they helped newcomers to survive in the early arrival of the whites to the land where for thousands of years belonged to native Americans. The flag which was shown at the end of the movie is the flag of United States today not of early years of independence with thirteen stars for unity and thirteen stripes for the number of colonies. The role of blacks as slaves is not shown, instead it's almost concluded that blacks were accompanying whites as servants who their future is also guaranteed with the independence of the unites states when the young black lady smiles and shows her proud of American independence which in reality was no turning point to blacks until later years. Indian Blue black, raising the hand and respecting American flag is an evidently false version of America in the past as no native guys who are going to be extinct in their own house will ever forgive newcomers for all their atrocities, genocide, undomesticated behavior and selfish interpretation of the Bible."
69,Drums Along the Mohawk,6,22 December 2006,Bloodthirsty savage or Noble savage.,"As Stuart Hall mentioned ""questions of identity are always questions about representation. They almost always involve the silencing of something in order to something else to speak."" (Hall, 1995). In this sense, constructing a national identity needs to make some differences between us and others. Following the formula of Othering, some defined American identity as ""not British"", but even more quickly and repeatedly, American national identity was conceived of as ""not Indian."" So the images of Native Americans were traced as the Other to European Americans. This representations were done through the books, plays, books, paintings, games, and songs all contributed to white attitudes regarding Native Americans, and cinema would inherit many of those conventions, including basic stereotypes and the dramatic narrative of American settlers needing to battle Indians in order to form a great country.(Benshoff,2004;98) There were two kinds of stereotyping Native Americans: the Indian as either a marauding, bloodthirsty savage or a more benign and helpful noble savage. The bloodthirsty savage view constructed Native Americans as violent, aggressive, and demonic, bent on destroying innocent white settlers, including women and children. Lurid stories and paintings of Indian raiders kidnapping and raping white women were consistently popular during this period. In other stories, Native Americans were regulated as noble savages, primitive and childlike rather than threatening and violent. According to this stereotype, Native Americans, lacking in European customs, supposedly maintained purer instincts about nature and the world around them. Through this movie (Drums along the Mohawk), the director and screenwriters used both of these stereotypes. The first time that an Indian was shown, the audiences saw an old Indian man who was mentally as a child. It was clear through his behavior in the film that director had represented intentionally Indians in the noble savages stereotype, a primitive and childlike rather than threatening and violent. This kind of Indians was tolerable because they could be alienated and assimilated with the white Americans lifestyle, beliefs and religions. Nevertheless, most of the Indians were performed in the other stereotype, which was bloodthirsty savage. These Native Americans' characterization was simply as blood-mad, half-naked lunatics, violent, aggressive, and demonic, bent on destroying innocent white settlers, including women and children. Indians were only pictured when they were attacking to the whites' community but nothing traced whites savagery against the Indians. For making perfect the Indian bloodthirsty savagery, directors showed the white surrendered man whom Indians burned while he was still alive and make horrible noises. The other scene which expressed Indian savagery obviously, was the sequence that two Indians attacked to an old alone woman and were going to kill her and burn her house. A battle between an old woman who was not able to defend of her and two savage men who are far from humanity and treat as animals could be very meaningful within a social and ideological context that everyday was reinforcing hostility against the people who were not from European origins. The interesting point was that if the Indians wanted to get the victory over the whites, they had to use the European guns and a British or white leadership of their attacks. It is completely meaningful because Indians were always represented as foolish and childlike who are not able to make a logical design. Therefore, they had to come to whites for thoughtful issues. The film gave a narrative of the history that was completely different with the reality. Those who had suffered of savagery and massacre in real world were Indians who had been conquered by the white Europeans. It was extremely exaggerated as far as most of the audiences were to feel sympathy with whites who were suffering of the misery. The narrative of the film was extremely misguiding about the first nation and inhabitant of the west hemisphere or New World. Battle between civilization(that was represented by white Americans) and wilderness (that was represented by the Native Americans) was implied through the physical battle between whites and Indians. Throughout a sociological approach, emphasis on family as units that would make the society was a indicator of importance of the family values in the traditional (and to some extent contemporary) American society. A newly married white couple, as the main characters of the movie, traveled to Mohawks Valley to begin their new life. Why did they travel to the frontiers? That is the point that could be answered and justified by the American expansionism, which is justified through the Manifest Destiny notion. The other point that was obvious in the film was religious factor in American communities as a means for social integration in early of their history and even now. All the time for discussing about a special issue, they collected in the church and after praying they started to talk about the new challenges. Therefore, religious leadership had special power to justify battle against savage Indians and faceless Redcoats. It was emphasized on the Christianity within the film repeatedly and the local priest was adapting the war against Indians as war against devil and in this way provoked people to being involved in the war. Alliance among the people and especially between men and women against a foreign enemy was considered in the movie. At the disastrous moments, there was no difference among male and female but at the other times what was clear was an internally subordinated women by men. In this sense, women are always dependent on men that referred to the white patriarchal ideology among the Americans. At the last scene of the film, the American flag was raised as a symbol of victory and turning point for making American national identity. Since then everyone who believed on this flag could be part of the American nation."
70,Drums Along the Mohawk,5,5 December 2006,Ford manages to re-produce history!,"IntroductionSynopsis The film stars Henry Fonda farmer Gilbert Martin, who, in 1776, has returned with his wife, Lana, to his small cabin in the Mohawk Valley. Lana gradually adjusts to farm work and is soon able to help her husband in the fields. Their farmhouse is attacked by a party of Tory-led Indians. The Widow McKlennar hires and shelters the couple, but soon after the Indians invade their community once more. Thus, men join the militia and try to win their independence from Britain, and defend their community against the crude wilderness and its dwellers....SettingThe film is made in 1939; however, it is a broken mirror through which to see the American Wars of Independence. The American frontier life during the colonial period, with all its hardships and dangers, is the theme of the film. One American community is built in the Mohawk Valley in New York and the people have farm-life there. Although of the Revolutionary American era, the film mainly focuses on how whites and Indians encounter each other, with obviously depicting the Indians as untamable savages who have no mercy on white colonists. Analysis Any historical account is informed by personal taste and prejudices. Reviewing history books gives us knowledge of the story of colonial America becoming a nation. No doubt, the accounts by different historians differ in details, but the essence remains significantly the same in almost all of them. However, to learn history form the viewpoint of the silver screen is another story. Steven Mintz in his review of the book ""Past Imperfect: History According to the Movies"" edited by Mark C. Carnes- talks of the ""films' role in the construction of cultural memory"". In the so-called ""United States of Amnesia"" the history is easily distorted, disfigured, clad-in-love scenes and presented to the audience; beautiful it is to notice how the audience digest it as authentic. If you have a look at the non-professional review section in www.IMDb.com you will find the tragic reality come true. Many have found it a historical narration. Some have even advised history fans to go and watch it! This is the process of constructing ""cultural memory"" by an insignificant film of 67 years ago up to the present. This is ""gap of representation"" in the medium of movie. Mintz also quotes the distinguished anthropologist Anthony F.C. Wallace criticizing the inadequacy of the film even in reproducing the original book, by adding that the film is a failure in ""its depiction of Native Americans as stupid or savage killers."" The simple binary division of good/bad, savage/Christian Indian is one of the greatest flaws of the film, though the audience might endorse it. Being Ford's first color film, Drums along the Mohawk, nonetheless, is a failed attempt to convert black/white coloring of the story into a gray continuum of characterization. All American whites are heroic able-minded men and women who withstand hardships to witness the birth of their nation. They are simple villagers, but in their hearts, they surrender to the savage wilderness; they are, in case of Lana, well-bred people who adjust to the situation for the sake of unity, love and future of their land. The other issue of high import is that in a colonial community of immigrants inevitably different European origins have a stake; but in this film barely you might come across a German or Irish immigrant within the community. This clearly proves the partiality of John Ford. The other interesting point about the movie is the same theme of patriotism, fear of Indians and other invaders and the military power of the immigrants during the colonial period. Set in the time of the American Revolutionary War, the film is not only a means of re-presenting history, but also indicative of what is going on in the time film is being produced. Such social factors as the Great Depression and the World War II had their influence upon the narrative of the film; Americans were confused as what their role was both internally and universally; and this was the time when more than ever myths came to help the American psyche find its way. According to Ziauddin Sardar and Merryl Wyn Davies (American Dream, global Nightmare, 2004, p.32 American history is infused with fears and threats, and the American film industry takes the responsibility to remind Americans of such fears, when needed. Thus, it is regarded as a myth-making device on the eve of the Second World War. Americans should first be scared, and then called into action. Back to the issue of Indian Americans, it is evident throughout the film that only one Indian is presented as good, one who is Christianized and helps the colonists. Others are heartless giants who are stereotypically malign, blood-thirsty and stupid. Ward Churchill, in his paper ""Smoke Signals: a History of Native Americans in Cinema"", points to this fact that Indians are depicted so because they have never had any voice in American film industry. Interestingly, he makes it clear that even when Indians were given trivial roles they were ordered to wear heavy bleaching make-ups in order not to annoy the audience. The last point is that while the song ""My Country"" (which is heard at the last scene of the film as a sign of American nation being born) is a patriotic one, it highly resembles the British national anthem. What this might convey? Of course, Ford is no fool not to understand the similarity of the two. Instead it seems that in 1939 it signals a future possibility of the United States becoming ally to the Great Britain in the World War II. Also, it adds to the patriotic theme of the film, thus provoking the patriotic emotions of the Americans on the brink of WW II."
71,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,12 July 2006,Very good John Ford movie,"John Ford's first movie in color is set at the time of the Revolutionary Wars in the US.Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert star as a newly wed couple making their start on the frontier. Attacks by Indians and their British allies are obstacles they have to overcome.The film centers on the transformation of the Colbert character from a refined eastern woman to a tough frontier woman.The color photography in this movie is stunning.The Indian attacks are surprisingly shown in all its brutality.Edna May Oliver in a supporting part delivers one of her typical roles of a tough,old maiden although here she's more human than in for example in David Copperfield (1935).One more John Ford movie I enjoyed.Favorite scene: Henry Fonda outrunning three Indian braves."
72,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,1 April 2006,Drums Along The Mohawk,"A fine and memorable movie,only just a tad of a Thanksgiving post card. The story line was great but director John Ford seemed to need to place picture post card frames in the film. By this I mean:All the short fat old men with their stomachs purposely stinking out and smoking those long pipes.The scene where they are first clearing the land by themselves and here is ""Gil"" leaning on a pitch fork. (Quick take a picture for the Thanksgiving table).Listen closely: During the first Indian attack at Gil & Lana's I can swear Gil tells Lana - ""I'll get the CAR"".All in all though a CLASSIC movie.By the way director John Ford insisted the film be shot in Utah."
73,Drums Along the Mohawk,7,14 September 2005,one of Ford's lesser films,"This movie is set right before the Revolutionary War in which Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert are recently married and move from a nice city to a small house in the woods in which there are hardly any neighbors around. Colbert comes from a rich family who doesn't approve of her moving but they can't do anything about it. When they first reach their house, Colbert is confronted by an Indian and she is hysterical and starts screaming. It only gets worse for her and Fonda's friends are a lot rougher and from a different class then from where she came from. Their house is burned down by some Indians and they wind up living with Edna May Oliver. This isn't one of Ford's better known films and it's easy to see why, but it does have some Ford regulars like Ward Bond and John Carradine."
