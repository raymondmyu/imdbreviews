0,Lucky,10,28 September 2017,Harry Dean Stanton's Masterpiece,"Please disregard that review by an IMDb user who claims to ""Crave intellectual depth"" but is clearly unable to recognize it, and cannot see beyond the superficial.It proves what Lucky says in the film: ""I always thought that the one thing we could agree on is what we were looking at...but that's bullshit, because what I see isn't what you see.""Mr. Stanton's powerful, truth-telling performance is at turns heartbreaking, uplifting, hilarious, and inspiring.Please do yourself a favor and see this very special film."
1,Lucky,10,17 October 2017,Five bags of popcorn,"In terms of humanity, Lucky is the simplest story I've ever connected with. Seeing it in theaters was one of the most emotional experiences I've ever had watching a movie. Lucky walks the thin line between being an exploration of death and a celebration of life, because it manages to be both. Lucky is a character that at first couldn't care less about his mortality. He didn't think about it because he didn't have to. But when the effects of old age start to set in, Lucky can't help but see his own death everywhere. With the onset of this fear, he learns to embrace death - ""realism"", as said in the movie. However, this process was not so easy, as he first had to let go of his anger to understand the beauty and sadness in the experience of his whole life up until his old age, and everything he has yet to be a part of. Many try to claim that movies ""used to be simpler"" and ""had better stories"" due to less technology, but I'll be damned if they aren't easier to connect to now than ever. Lucky follows suit of movies, loosely like ""Manchester by the Sea"", and greatly like ""Paterson"" which both came out within the past year. These movies pay homage to real life by stripping the substance down to normal human experiences that most end up having to face, and everyone can at least recognize. In particular, Lucky is that of accepting how everything in life will go away, so all that can be done is to experience it. This ephemeral experience of life is both beautiful and sad, as this movie is both about life and death. The reason that a movie like Lucky hit me so hard was because it didn't throw anything in my face. I was so immersed in what felt like real life to me that it took me by surprise when all the sudden it got so emotional, like in the bar. Lucky's stance in the bar, letting go and explaining his stance as a human being was, besides ""The Elephant Man"", the most emotionally moved I've ever been by a single scene. This is because everything develops so naturally, and because I personally connect with what Stanton's character comes back to after 90 some years of age - simply learning how to smile by letting go. While all aspects of the filmmaking delivered this effect, I recognize the script for their organic emotional accomplishment within the story.To me, Lucky is owning up to the internal and external unknown, representing the ongoing process of learning how to smile in a world that can just feel so heavy."
2,Lucky,8,13 October 2017,A wonderful swan song to the amazing career of Harry Dean Stanton,"In terms of actors, there were very few like Harry Dean Stanton. He could bring emotion and eccentricity to a role like few others. Whether it being a ""space trucker"" in Alien, Molly Ringwald's father in Pretty in Pink or any one of his collaborations with David Lynch, Stanton was a icon of cinema. His presence though always felt like seeing an old friend, a sense of comfort seeing his withered, story driven face. Other than Paris Texas, Stanton was only litigated to supporting and minor roles in films. Appropriately, for one of his final performances, Stanton was given the chance in the spotlight again. Lucky isn't a film about much. Directed by John Carroll Lynch (another great character actor) in his directorial debut, it simply follows the everyday routine of Lucky (played by Stanton) and the interactions he has with many of the local townsfolk. Lucky seemed like the role that Harry Dean was always born to play. It could almost be considered a companion piece to the 2013 documentary on Stanton, Partly Fiction. It incorporates much of Stanton's real-life philosophy, dry wit and even his musical ability into the final product as well. It feels like Lucky is just an extension of Stanton's personality which is absolutely wonderful. He was born to play this role and it would be a crime to see anyone else play Lucky. There's wonderful cameos from many different great actors including Ron Livingston, Tom Skerritt, Ed Begley Jr and of course his long-time collaborator David Lynch. All of them bring a wonderful warmth to their performance, despite their brief screen time (Lynch in particular, has a wonderful monologue about his lost tortoise 'President Roosevelt'). This is very much a character piece over a narrative piece which may put some viewers off. However, to anyone that enjoys these types of movies with philosophical contemplation with wonderful characters and dialogue, this is certainly a movie for you. It serves as a great ending to Hollywood's best character actor."
3,Lucky,9,15 October 2017,Goodbye Harry.,"If ever there was a deserving send off for a grand actor, then this be it.As ""Lucky"", the cantankerous but lovable old sole, shuffling his way out of this mortal coil, Harry Dean Stanton is, as always, remarkable. Striding with purpose, very slowly, through a very regimented daily routine - diner coffee, crossword, game shows, cactus watering, smokes, drinks at the local watering hole - Lucky is revealed as a complex, always thinking, opinionated, ready to drop the gloves, 91 year old.There are several great performances, highlighted by David Lynch bemoaning the escape of his pet tortoise, but the film really belongs to Harry. Swiping some great real life histories (Stanton's stint with the Navy) blurs the line between fact and fiction just enough to act both as a fitting tribute and engrossing movie on it's own merit. This is a talkie, where action moves at a tortoise pace, but it matters not, for Lucky has that rare power to draw the audience right on in.Among the many low key but brilliant highlights, is a stirring scene to which Johnny Cash sings Bonnie Prince Billie's ""I See a Darkness"".Harry Dean Stanton was indeed Lucky."
4,Lucky,9,20 October 2017,"An homage to old age and the meaning of life, if there is one","A loving homage to an actor and musician that anyone over 50 has seen in movies over several decades. I wiped away tears several times over beautiful, thoughtful musings by Lucky, who, in most respects, was Harry Dean Stanton himself. This is a small but significant slice of life movie and showcases excellent writing, direction and acting by several collaborators who've worked together before. Notable understated performance by David Lynch whose character's lost tortoise serves as an analogy that some viewers who haven't lived several decades yet will not yet appreciate. I was stilled when Lucky sang, sad when Johnny Cash sang and I smiled, satisfied, at the end. I will watch this movie again with friends who understand the beauty of a simple and well written film like this and we will all feel satisfied and more connected as a result."
5,Lucky,7,9 October 2017,Harry Dean Stanton Says Goodbye To You All,"Lucky is both eerie and alluring in that it hasn't just turned out to be Harry Dean Stanton's swan song, it's as if all of those involved in the making of it were watching the Grim Reaper approach Mr. Stanton from a distance during filming.They were certainly aware - and impressed - that he was 90 years old. There's not a bad performance in the whole film; everyone gives a thoughtful, elegant performance as if there is no room for childishness in the presence of the approaching death of their friend. Surely Mr. Stanton could feel to the core that his days were numbered, and wow did that make for an eloquent performance in a role perfectly suited for him. Despite Lucky being a film about the waning of life, it's not a morose film; the message seems to be that while death is scary, you can still smile at it, and still smile till the end. And while you lose some liveliness as you grow old, that doesn't mean that you have to lose your feistiness. As much as I enjoyed Lucky, I also believe that a good filmmaker could have followed almost any old man for a few weeks with a video camera and come up with an equally interesting film. Lucky is essentially one down-to-earth old man's tale of a rather unexciting present-day life, and that's about it...but maybe that's special in itself. Still, I didn't see a whole lot that was fantastic about it beyond Mr. Stanton's performance. But there's no denying that it's a well-made film, with poignant and sometimes amusing moments, moving stories from the distant past, and many good shots of the desolate, solitary desert."
6,Lucky,6,30 September 2017,"Critics are raving about it, myself... not as much","""YOU'RE NOTHING!"" That's Lucky's announcement each time he enters his local diner. It's his way of greeting everyone in the place and in a way it is also sums up this movie. It has some wonderful scenes and wonderful performances but really doesn't add up to very much.Since legendary actor Harry Dean Stanton passed away I have had this movie's release date circled on my calendar. I would have anyway since I am a fan of his and it was only his second leading role in a 60+ year career. His other, ""Paris, Texas"" (1984), is one of my favorite movies of all time.The movie turned out to be his Swan Song and, with so much of his real life experiences incorporated into his character makes it all the more poignant. When the film is over it's difficult to not think that Stanton wasn't saying goodbye to all of us.That makes this movie worth seeing. He has some terrific scenes with a great cast including director and friend David Lynch, Ron Livingston, James Gavin, Tom Skerritt and Ed Begley Jr. There's a touching scene when Harry/Lucky admits he's concerned about life's end and another at a fiesta where he sings in Spanish (something he's always done beautifully throughout his life).In spite of this I cannot say the movie as a whole really jelled. In between the banter with his co-stars there was too much... well, NOTHING. That may have been the point when you consider it was Harry Zen's real-life philosophy but I couldn't help but feel a bit empty by the entire viewing experience. There were certain behaviors he exhibited in the town he lived in that I hoped to see fleshed out and it never happened. Places in town he'd observe and are left to guess what he's seeing, never to find out. There were relationships he had with people where I thought some kind of arc would materialize but NOTHING happened. What can I say? I wanted more and got too much of NOTHING! Lol.Aesthetically, I was bothered by the editing transitions of fading to black/fade in from black of which there are way too many. It became a distraction serving only to contemplate being in a theater with other patrons and taking me away from what was happening on screen.""Lucky"" is really not a bad film. At all. It is a nice cap to Stanton's career. His fans will appreciate his final role and I'm glad to have seen it. I only wish I could say it was a movie I would revisit repeatedly. For me it really isn't.Rest In Peace Harry Dean. We'll always have Paris... Texas. 😊"
7,Lucky,8,27 October 2017,"Not a great film, but it is an important one I think.","'LUCKY': Four Stars (Out of Five) A drama starring Harry Dean Stanton in one of his final on-screen roles, before his death on September 15th, 2017. Stanton plays a 90-year-old atheist dealing with old age. It was directed by veteran actor turned first time director John Carroll Lynch, and it was written by Logan Sparks and Drago Sumonja (two veteran actors turned first time screenwriters). The movie also features supporting turns from David Lynch, Ron Livingston, Beth Grant, Ed Begley Jr., Barry Shabaka Henley and Tom Skerritt (reuniting him with his 'ALIEN' costar). The film has received almost unanimous rave reviews from critics, with Stanton's performance getting especially high praise. I think it's a well made character study, with a good performance from Stanton, but it's also just a little overrated.Stanton plays Lucky, a 90-year-old stuck in his ways, including smoking, that spends his time walking around his small town and hanging out with other elderly locals at a dive bar. He faints one day, and has to see a doctor (Begley Jr.) about it. Then he starts worrying about his upcoming death. The whole time he gets into arguments with his friends, and outsiders; like a lawyer (Livingston) setting up a will for his friend's (Lynch) turtle. He also continues to try to light up cigarettes in non smoking establishments.The movie is slow-paced, but it does have a lot of interesting dialogue. Not a lot happens in it, so it will seem pretty uneventful (and dull) to some viewers, but those that appreciate a good character study should enjoy it. It's also pretty insightful; about dealing with old age and your quickly approaching death. Stanton is really good in the film, and it's great to see him in a lead role finally. It's also sad that he's no longer with us, but it's touching that he got this one last good role to play (about death and old age oddly enough). It's not a great film, but it is an important one I think.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/eoAny_TuUM4"
8,Lucky,8,25 October 2017,"A film of reflection on life, thought, time, and journey at one's end of the road.","Just recently saw an independent film called ""Lucky"" with the now late character actor Harry Dean Stanton and clearly it was a touching swan song for Harry and for those who viewed it. Stanton is Lucky a living 90 year old man who's probably at the end of the tunnel despite okay health. And you guessed it he's set in his ways especially with the belief that he doesn't want to face death or he's not too set on the believe of a higher power.Living in the southwest Lucky's days are spent walking, and going to the local bar and diner to drink and he passes his time during the day after getting up working puzzles and watching game shows. Plus he even smokes some weed with a new African American female friend. And the chats and visits with locals and friends help Lucky move along.Still thru it all this old man is set in his ways he who doesn't want new acceptance or change in which he fears in his small town life it's a long last reflection on life and being who he is. The supporting cast is well rounded here with David Lynch, Ed Begley Jr., Tom Skeritt and others. Overall well done film of one looking at their life and surroundings and coming to terms with time and reflection without change."
9,Lucky,10,30 September 2017,Rare and terrific movie,"There aren't any other movies like this one. No answers, just the blue sky and the desert. Who else gives us the end of our lives so bleakly, so movingly, and so warmly? At the very end Lucky spots Mr. Roosevelt, the tortoise who escaped Howard's yard and will live--probably--another hundred years, and he almost smiles. That's about the size of it for him. And for many of the rest of us."
10,Lucky,8,15 October 2017,Towering last performance from Harry Dean Stanton,"""Lucky"" (2017 release; 90 min.) brings the story of an old man whom everyone calls Lucky. As the movie opens, we watch a turtle walk across the cactus landscape somewhere in the Southwest. We then get to know Lucky, as he gets ready for the day and does his daily exercises, all while smoking a cigarette. Other than a couple of milk cartons, his fridge is empty. Lucky gets breakfast at the small town's diner, where he does word puzzles. In the evening, Lucky meets up with his buddies at Elaine's, one of 2 bars in town. Howard tells of Mr. Roosevelt, his beloved turtle who has escaped. Next morning, as Lucky is starting his daily routine, he blanks out and falls. When he wakes up, he is in a doctor's office. What will become of Lucky? At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the pot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director John Carroll Lynch, who most recently brought us ""The Founder"" and ""Jackie"". Here he goes a very different direction, namely to give legendary Hollywood actor Harry Dean Stanton one last lead performance, in a role specifically written for Stanton. Lucky is, like Stanton in real life, 90 years and grew up in Kentucky, so this is almost (but of course not quite) a look at the real Harry Dean Stanton. There are some fine secondary roles in this, including David Lynch as Howard the turtle guy (Stanton has played in a number of Lynch movies), and Tom Skerritt as the WWI Marine veteran. But in the end this is all about watching Stanton, who remained in full control of all of his acting talent (check out the scene where Lucky attends a Mexican fiesta...). As it turned out, this was indeed Stanton's very last film (he passed away exactly a month ago today), and what a towering last performance that turned out to be! You can bet your last dollar that Stanton will get a posthumous Best Actor Oscar nomination for this.""Lucky"" finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (5 people, including myself), That is a darn shame. I imagine interest in this movie will pick up coming the awards season. If you want to see an amazing actor at work in the last part of his life, in a movie that is rich in so many ways, I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
11,Lucky,8,26 October 2017,90-year-old atheist prepares for death by enjoying last days on earth,"Lucky moves  and moves us  on two levels, the personal and the thematic. Our visceral experience is of Harry Dean Stanton's valedictory. He died shortly after completing this work. Across a career of (IMDB says:) 200 film/TV roles, he fashioned the persona of a stoic, weather-pounded and beaten survivor. He had  nope, has  one of the most lived-in faces and starved bodies in American cinema. His role in Big Love was one of the few which let him wield power. But that role apart, moral authority he always had. So when Stanton at 91 plays the 90-year-old veteran living out his last solitary days in a desert town, Stanton is living out his last days too. He's telling us he feels Lucky  lucky even to be living this reduced hard-scramble life, lucky to have stumbled into that long and rich career, lucky even to be moving towards his  our unpromising end. The film's major themes centre on two phrases. One is the definition of ""realism"" that Lucky seizes upon: It's a ""thing,"" the ability to see things as they are and to learn to live with that. When he describes realism and then freedom as ""a thing"" he blurs the line between the material and the abstract. There is no abstract beyond our physical existence.As an atheist, Lucky has no afterlife to worry about, nor any judge to whom to hold himself ultimately accountable. He is free to do what he wants and to accept only what responsibility he chooses. He chooses when and when not to light up a cigarette in a no-smoking area. The second phrase is the fall that gives Lucky his first intimation of mortality. He literally falls. But in a broader sense, Lucky is postlapsarian man. Adam's fall left mankind mortal and alienated. The harsh desert landscape here is relieved solely by the plush garden/oasis of Eve's, the fancy dining spot from which chef Lucky was fired for toking up in the kitchen. That's weed as the Forbidden Fruit. Whenever Lucky passes that garden he spits the misogynous c-epithet at it. But not the last time. The last time he passes it without resenting his expulsion, his alienation. Perhaps that shows his response to some particular episodes of community. In his daily morning coffee shop, he chats with a fellow WW II vet. He also engages with an irritating insurance agent Lucky earlier challenged to a fight over this predatory job. Two key scenes involve his engagement with women. The black waitress drops by to check on him and they share a joint, then a hug. The corner store owner invites him to her five-year- old son's fifth birthday party, where Lucky to everyone's surprise breaks out in a warm, gravelly Spanish song. After these scenes, he doesn't resent Eve's any more, because his community on earth is the only Eden we can expect. That we need to enjoy. At first Harry lives days of unthinking ritual. He buys the daily quart of milk even though he still has two in the fridge  and little else. He mechanically lights up and tosses cigarettes because he has outlived their threat to his health. He swaps barbs with the coffee shop staff and regulars. He paces out the desert. The two scenes with the women restore his sense of genuine community, recover his awareness of the richness of life  even at this reduction, in the arid land and aging. So here is Lucky living out his last days, sharply attuned to seizing the present riches  such as they are  because there is no beyond to diminish them. If there is a faith to be had then it's in what we find on earth, not in anything supposedly beyond. In two scenes he talks on his red phone to some man  whom, we never learn. That's a parody of speaking to someone supposedly in the beyond, of uncertain existence. That's where he learns his ""realism""  from the implied absence at the other end of the line. Lucky here recovers his faith in the people around him, the friendly and accepting community. If there is any justice or reward it will have to be here on earth, nowhere else. That may dishearten the conventionally faithful but it should hearten the rest.And once we accept the limits on our existence, the futility of our attempts to control what lies beyond us, once the only ""things"" we need are that ""realism"" and ""freedom,"" that's when we can get the most out of life. After all, once the other man gave up his hopes for finding his escaped tortoise, once he sat back and accepted his fate, that's when the tortoise came back. That's the ""new deal"" that President Roosevelt (that tortoise) here represents."
12,Lucky,6,22 October 2017,You'll Die Too Late,"Beams crack through the window, and a radio sparks a tune. Lucky twirls the dial to cut off the morning theme, reaching for a cigarette to breathe. Hybrid yoga calisthenics disrupt his lung blackening, and a digital coffee pot blares a preset time. A ritualized beginning slowly bleeds all meaning.Lucky earned his name by doing nothing much at all. His non- combative post in the Navy as a backseat soldier birthed this apt moniker. A suitable title, for even his physician cannot fathom the stock of good fortune the old bastard possesses. With the health of an oxen, Lucky seems doomed to an immortal life sentence.A word fiend by heart, he has a dictionary of biblical proportions enthroned on a sunlit pulpit. The morning paper offers a grid of linguistic possibilities to quench his lust for articulation. Each day comes with a new pillar of language that Lucky attaches a melodramatic but charming significance to.Stopping by predictable spaces, his daily proceedings have a cyclical and absolute geography. The diner feeds his hunger for camaraderie. The grocery outlet fills his calcium and nicotine addictions. And the tavern houses a captive audience that will occasionally entertain his existential ramblings.Howard might be the only friend left that resonates with Lucky's twilight nightmares. Ascribing galactic meaning to his tortoises, Howard chooses to be in awe at every possible moment. Lucky still has a knack in upsetting the open-minded Howard, but only due to his brash form of prophecy.Not a particularly wise man, Lucky gains insight that is indecipherable to his peers. A deteriorating man stuck in a town that shrinks whenever his knowledge expands. A mortal coil suffocates his desire to thumb through etymology, and sends him into the desert to examine callous cacti."
13,Lucky,8,16 January 2018,I wouldn't want to fight me either.,"Lucky (Harry Dean Stanton) is a crusty opinionated WWII navy veteran. The town loves and understands him more than he does them. He lives alone in a desert town and has a routine which includes taking puffs off a cigarette between yoga workouts. After a black out incident, Lucky becomes a man in search of a philosophy to deal with his own finality, a man who appears to have atheistic views. The film moves very slow, but has an interesting cast of characters that gather at Elaine's. I enjoyed the cinematography, the angles, the symbolism, a beautiful show of a nothing town...one that makes us smile. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
14,Lucky,10,10 January 2018,The Man in the Moonshine,"Have you ever seen 1999's ""The Straight Story,"" directed by David Lynch? Do you remember the character played by Wiley Harker? This film could be a fictional account of that character's life.Instead, it is a love letter and a tribute to the life and times of one of the greatest real-life characters ever, the late Harry Dean Stanton.The film is simple, straight forward and less than 90 minutes long. You won't find action, adventure, visual effects, sordid affairs, chase scenes or laugh-out-loud humor. You will find a man, alone, sometimes scared, set in his ways, living
his simple, daily life on his own terms. He doesn't try to impress anyone - and neither does this film. It is what it is - take it or leave it - like it or not.Stanton is, of course, excellent, as are the supporting players. The soundtrack is gratifying - highlighted by Stanton himself singing ""Volver, Volver"" in Spanish at a 10-year-old's birthday party. (""The Man in the Moonshine"" is the other great track - at the end of the credits.)Overall, whether you liked Harry Dean Stanton or not, this film is a perfect celebration of his life!(10 out of 10 stars)"
15,Lucky,10,9 January 2018,"The older you are, the more you will see in this movie.","When born actors live long enough to perfect their talent, and they share the insight that their characters experience in life, you get a masterpiece. But, like the Mona Lisa, viewers perceive nuance as THEY age; even though the painting ITSELF remains unchanged. What cannot be seen with young eyes waits for older eyes to catch up. The younger viewer perceives the ironic as insight. The emotion they experience evolves from the pathetique. In contrast the emotion I felt was that of fulfillment and apprehension regarding the next chapter of existence. When it was first unveiled, I doubt that people came from the world over to stare at Mona Lisa as they do today. Harry could not have spun a better yarn, nor crafted a better legacy for future generations. How lucky some of us have been to see his career flower - what a thrill to watch its last petal set free. Watch this movie every 10 years."
16,Lucky,,7 January 2018,Good for what it is,"This is definitely exactly the type of film you think it is based on the premise. It's definitely a good one, definitely worth it. John Carroll Lynch did a fine job directing this as his debut, and he is aided by a pretty good performance by Harry Dean Stanton. I don't think the film ever rises to greatness but it has a lot going for it, and it is definitely recommended. I look forward to what Lynch does next."
17,Lucky,8,5 January 2018,Slow philosophical film about the meaning of life,"Stanton died the year this movie was released. As such, it is a great send of for him. However, he is not the only one doing their part in the film: David Lynch (acting, rather than directing, while actor John Carroll Lynch is actually directing, without them being related), Ron Livingston, Ed Begley Jr.,Tom Skerritt, Beth Grant and others are there to participate in dialogue driven anecdotes that tell us things about the characters and what they are inside. They do a great job. And if you are like me, wondering where did you know James Darren (Paulie) from, he played in a lot of movies, but I know him as Vic Fontaine, from Star Trek DS9.Anyway, this film will not appeal to all, but it was fresh and I was in the mood to enjoy it, I guess. It is like a collection of sketches that slowly reveal the inner workings of the main character and some of his friends. I liked it a lot."
18,Lucky,8,5 January 2018,President Roosevelt is still searching for the meaning of life,"Ah, Lucky....don't look for any Lucky action figures to come from this film as there was no action, but lots of existential, blasphemous and curse words along with lots of walking around in an unnamed and dying desert town. Lucky was played by Harry Dean Stanton, perhaps just as HDS plays himself every day.....radio alarm, coffee, crossword puzzle, and a freshly washed face before walking into town for another day of sameness. No food, just milk and cigarettes for a skin and bones ancient man to exist upon, as that is what Lucky does, exist rather than live, in his own mind and surely to some others there. But to the perhaps more enlightened in the town he is a cranky but well respected sage of the ages it would seem, as he parsimoniously spouts his gems of wisdom about the stupidity of religious belief, the meaninglessness of life, and the meanings of word choices in his crossword puzzles to any of his buddies at the diner and the bar he chooses to visit every day in his cast in stone life routine. Lucky had to have his ""Bloody Maria's"", his needed daily lifeblood, along with multiple packs of cigarettes, as much as he needed breath. Perhaps more.The supporting characters treat him far better than one would think he deserved, but perhaps they saw in him aged wisdom as they surely tolerated his eccentricities well, and some even supported them. And so it went every day, with stories of a friend's tortoise named President Roosevelt ""running"" away from home never to be found, to old military stories of sadness and loss, and one harsh conflict, later resolved, with a salesman over a friend's need for life insurance and death planning. And, to top it all off near the end, a very touching HDS singing a beautiful Spanish language song to the kids and parents at a birthday fiesta to which he was generously invited by a sympathetic lady shop owner. An absolute stunner of a performance.Some of Harry Dean's real life buddies were in the film.....Ed Begley Jr., Tom Skerritt, and David Lynch, all adding a real life flavor to this near biopic of one of America's most respected and revered character actors. One may still be Waiting For Godot, but HDS actually existed and as a result of his loss he will be greatly missed by those of us who are still pondering a meaning to our own existence."
19,Lucky,9,5 January 2018,One of the great existentialist movies,"A great movie has to be entertaining right to the end and also examine life in a brutally honest way. 
This movie does this. 
It is about the question who and what are we and about the emptiness we fear is outside our consciousness.
But is also is funny in a real way. Not like the Adam Sandler crap. 
Of this movie one can say: Watch it. It is about you. 
And about what Ernest Hemingway called ""grace under pressure"" - where pressure is the life we all experience. 
I am glad I saw it."
20,Lucky,1,8 January 2018,"Boring, Boring, Bad, Boring - Don't trust the other Reviews","It seems that this movie was made by ""Lucky Strike"", a tobacco company for those that don't know. The other reviews are made by machines or something like that, they probably hired one of those strange companies. The movie is really really bad, doesn't have an strong argument, it's filmed always in the same place, nothing exciting or intellectually attractive."
21,Lucky,10,3 January 2018,Harry Dean Stanton deserves a Lifetime Achievement Award,"What can you say about this movie and this performance. It resonated with me in so many ways. The existential journey was so perfectly centered in this character. The dialogue, the character development, and the story that was proffered were perfectly in sync. One of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I'll be going back to this time and time again."
22,Lucky,6,25 September 2017,Aging Flesh,"I'm not a fan of aging flesh, my own included. So the sight of Harry Dean Stanton repeatedly washing his armpits each morning? Not pretty. Actually I'm not much of a Stanton fan either, so since he's the lead character here--not my idea of entertainment. Yes the film mostly looks gorgeous, when we aren't focused on Stanton's pathetically thin, age-spotted limbs. But the editing is fun and the music is great. But sorry I'm not a fan of David Lynch either, so didn't much enjoy his supporting role. He should stick to directing, not a great actor. And really--the chain smoking? Made me sick. I didn't accept Stanton's character as either a wise, interesting or heroic man, so the whole enterprise left me cold."
23,Lucky,8,3 January 2018,"Great movie, but not your typical hollywood stuff","Well, it's not your typical hollywood movie. Really enjoy seeing the movie and all the suttle communications it brings during the development of the story. The way the turtle simbolizes death, and all the dialogues from the movie are centantly an inspiration for anyone."
