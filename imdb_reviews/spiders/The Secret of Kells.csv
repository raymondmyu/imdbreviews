0,The Secret of Kells,8,9 February 2010,Unforgettably Haunting Animation,"I would not have known about this film if not for its ""surprise"" Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature film. Thankfully, it came to pass that I was able to watch this animated little treasure.The story is about the child Brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective Abbot of the township of Kells. The main pre-occupation of the Abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, the renowned illustrator from Iona, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan befriended the white forest sprite Aisling, as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration.""The Secret of Kells"" is unlike most of the animation released these days. It is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism, as much as symbolism. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of ""Kung Fu Panda."" However, it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience. The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting.Try to catch this quiet gem of a film. It is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" and the like. The sparse Celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film. OK, the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting. I would have liked to know more about the Book that Brendan and Aiden was working on. But the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork, said to be based on the artwork in the real Book of Kells."
1,The Secret of Kells,9,30 March 2009,Beautiful!,"The Secret of Kells is a film I've been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I'm here to tell you now it's been worth the wait. The cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as I'd feared. The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, I particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page. The characterisation is superb, I love Brendan Gleeson's voice as the stern Abbot and I especially liked the voice of the sprite Aisling. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well realised, a mix of fact and fantasy. and really draws the viewer in to cheer on Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book. I'm a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know who've seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that it's a lovely little film. I will definitely buy the DVD when it's released, and would like to say, well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. May there be many more. :) Coming back in here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and gave them out at Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nominated."
2,The Secret of Kells,8,18 April 2010,enchanting visuals,"In an age where it seems all animation is either expensive computer generated, a-list celebrity vehicles or anime, which seems like it's all drawn by one man, it's refreshing to see an throw back to a time when animation was hand drawn and more attention was paid to the use of color and intricacy of design than mimicing real life or creating 3D.The characters in this movie at times take a back seat to the scenery. The scenery alternates between what seems to be illuminated water color to illuminated manuscript illustration. It is breathtaking to behold on the big screen.My main complaint about this film is that it was too short! I wish more time had been spent in the forest scenes, which are the richest in detail and color. One can imagine how the scenes in the Irish forest and wilderness inspired the illustrators of the Book of Kells.The story is not simply a child's tale, and there's no potty humor as is prevalent in many Pixar and Disney movies today, but children with vivid imaginations and who love to draw will love this as will their parents."
3,The Secret of Kells,10,3 May 2010,Sublime.  A Rare Gem and Utter Masterpiece,"It's a shame there were not more opportunities for people to see this on the big screen. It is stunningly beautiful. There is incredible detail in the artwork, all of it an homage to illumination.The reviews I read said the film was a spectacle and impressive for its art and topic, but that it was dry and slow. This simply isn't true. there is a rich and innocent humour in the film, and it is an exciting story.The story itself is quite sophisticated. On the one hand, it depicts medieval Christian scholar-heroes courageously dedicated to preserving knowledge, creating books, and demonstrating reverence for words through painstaking arts, and on the other there is a magical childhood world of fairy folk and demons who are part of a hero quest that is mythical and dreamy. Both the Christian world and the pagan world are fraught with danger and violence.The imagery, themes and music of this film create a work that is sublime, Yet the warmth of the characters and the spirited adventure ensures that the audience does not feel remote from the experience. This film ranks as an instant classic and a superb achievement in the medium of animation. having now seen all the animated films nominated at the Oscars, this one should have won.See it any way you can, and don't miss a chance to see it on the big screen if the opportunity arises."
4,The Secret of Kells,7,12 October 2010,A visually astounding animated movie.,"""Do you want to see the most beautiful page? The one that will turn darkness into light?""The story of The Secret of Kells is a simple one. A monastery in Ireland hurries to complete a wall that will hopefully protect it and its village from the coming destruction of the Vikings, when it is visited by a monk who also flees the Vikings. He brings with him a special book that he is writing, and a young boy who lives in the monastery tries to help him complete it, and meets a shape-shifting forest girl in the process. The friendship that's made between the two may end up saving both the book, and the lives of the monks and villagers. The aspect of The Secret of Kells that's most noteworthy is the visuals. This is one of the most gorgeous and visually inventive movies I've ever seen. The art style is like moving illustrations from a book of English fairy tales, and it constantly changes from scene to scene, offering new things to see while keeping the same basic theme. It really is a beautiful movie, and I don't see how anyone could watch it and not be thoroughly impressed by the amount of creativity and work that had to go into making this.On the whole, I think this will appeal to older teens and adults more than children, as it's a quite serious story, and pretty violent in some places. There's not much of the humor or kinetic antics that younger viewers usually like in their animated movies, but anyone old enough to appreciate The Secret of Kells will be quite pleased with this little gem."
5,The Secret of Kells,9,25 February 2010,"Beautiful, rich film!","The Secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful, and eye- popping animated films I have ever seen. Before watching this film, I was convinced that nothing could give Up a run for its money and that it was a shoo-in to win in this category, but I found in Kells a serious contender.The Secret of Kells tell the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with his uncle, the Abbot of Kell. The Abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by vikings than he is at nurturing the boy's imagination. When the legendary Brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) shows up and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named Aisling who takes a liking to him (and saves his life more than once). With Aisling's help, he attempts to save the town and help Brother Aidan complete the mystical book whichlegend has itcan turn dark into light.See my full review of The Secret of Kells at: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of- kells.html"
6,The Secret of Kells,9,10 December 2009,Kellbinding Animation.,"THE SECRET OF KELLS is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart. The shortcomings of the film's limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young Brendan's heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages. Historically this was in the late 8th century, when the centers of Irish learning were over-run by the Vikings. The Vikings appear here as brute antagonists, the equivalent on the North Seas of the plundering Huns and Mongols further East. The film's narrative--- which functions more as a parable--- centers around the conflict between Brendan, who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness, and his stern Uncle the Abbot-- who seeks to protect the town of Kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the Norsemen. The Abbot disregards the value of Brendan's art in his quest for security. This is the movie's outer conflict. Brendan's inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the Book of Kells. This eye is guarded by a Dragon Ouroboros, who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the Vikings will kill from without (That's as much of the story as I'll divulge!)What I really like about this film is its creators' imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the West from 1200 years ago. The characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original Book of Kells. (Particularly noteworthy is monk Aidan's pet cat, defined in few lines, yet purely--- and even magically metamorphically feline.) The range of emotion which Brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators. The decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene, and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in THE SECRET OF KELLS. Of course, historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict. However, by introducing archetypal elements into this story, the writers and director of THE SECRET OF KELLS convey a numinous sense of lived-life from that far-off time in Ireland which feels psychologically true, however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact. (The United Nations' band of illuminators who appear as a rogues' club of artists in The SECRET OF KELLS aren't historically probable, but they're all well-designed, individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially Irish story.) Animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures. The magnificent art direction of this movie clearly derives from its historical visual source, but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling; if animation had existed in the Dark Ages, the SECRET OF KELLS is what it would look like! Finally, Brendan's hero's quest in this film is the artist's perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty, life and inspiration. (Without being preachy or even particularly Christian, this movie affirms Jesus' dictum that ""Man does not live by bread alone."" ) In my estimation the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is Andrei Tarkovsky's ANDREI RUBLEV, a film about the great Russian icon painter of the 15th century. The SECRET OF KELLS expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artist's visual quest and creative process. It's certainly not as profound as ANDREI RUBLEV, but--- heck--- its a cartoon! (And one which will appeal to young and old alike.) I think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing: in its own modest life-affirming way, this stylized SECRET OF KELLS is a classic."
7,The Secret of Kells,10,9 December 2009,THE SECRET OF KELLS may be the most exquisite film I have seen...,"THE SECRET OF KELLS may be the most exquisite film I have seen since THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. Although stylistically very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (the jaw-dropping opening 2D sequence of) KUNG FU PANDA, incredible art direction, production design, background/layout and a richness in color that is a feast for one's senses. KELLS is so lavish -- almost Gothic in its layout (somewhat reminiscent of Klimt), wonderfully flat in general overall perspective, ornate in its Celtic & illuminated design, yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing -- AND it all works together beautifully. You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil & brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and all at Cartoon Saloon (& their extended crews) have achieved with this small budget/VERY small crewed film, is absolutely astounding. The groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal. This film is breathtaking and the buzz amongst our colleagues in recommending this film is spreading like wildfire. Congratulations to KELLS on its many accolades, its Annie nomination as well as its current Oscar qualifying run. They are all very well-deserved nods, indeed..."
8,The Secret of Kells,9,4 February 2010,History meets animation,"The Secret of Kells is an independent, animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript from the Middle Ages featuring the four Gospels of the New Testament. I didn't know that this book actually exists, but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier. There are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be, who wrote it, and how it has survived over 1,000 years. This is one of them.We are introduced to Brendan, an orphan who lives at the Abbey of Kells in Ireland with his uncle, Abbot Cellach (voiced by Brendan Gleeson). Abbot Cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks. Brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks. They are more focused on reading and writing, something Abbot Cellach does not have time for anymore. He fears the ""Northmen,"" those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the ground.One day a traveler comes from the island of Iona near Scotland. It is Brother Aidan, a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished. Abbot Cellach grants him permission to stay and Brendan buddies up with him. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. First he needs ink for the book, but he requires specific berries. The only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest, an area off limits to Brendan. Seeing that he is the only chance for Aidan to continue his work, he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence.In the forest Brendan meets Ashley, the protector of the forest. She allows Brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company. She warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it. There are things worse than Vikings out there. From there Brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasion.I like the story a lot more now that I know what it is about. Knowing now what the Book of Kells is and what it contains, the animation makes perfect sense. I'm sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago, with frilly borders, colorful pictures, and extravagant patterns, creatures, and writings adorning the pages. Much like the opening frames of Disney's The Sword in the Stone. The animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns. It creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each other.I couldn't take my eyes off of the incredible detail. This is some of the finest 2D animation I have seen in years. It's vibrant, stimulating, and full of life. The characters are constantly surrounded by designs, doodles, and patterns in trees, on the walls, and in the air just floating around. It enhances the film.The story is satisfactory, although I think the ending could have been strung out a little more. With a runtime of only 75 minutes I think there could have been something special in the final act. It doesn't give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book. We are reminded of it's importance but never fully understand. We are told that it gives hope, but never why or how. That was really the only lacking portion of the film. Otherwise I thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation.I guess that's okay to a certain degree. The animation can carry a film so far before it falls short. The story lacks a few parts, but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history. I would recommend looking up briefly the Book of Kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about. I think it will help your viewing experience a lot more. This a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed."
9,The Secret of Kells,10,11 April 2011,"Beautiful, underrated animation.","The Story of ""The secret of Kells"" takes place in a fascinating but overlooked historical period, the time of Viking invasions through Britain and Ireland: the time of pillages, frightened communities and monks.And caught between two adults, two monks, two ways of coping with the horde which is destroying society, young Brendan will find friendship, hardships, the power of beauty and culture and a troublesome coming of age. Blessed with gorgeous, colorful, period-inspired art, The Secret of Kells is a classic tale, but a tale told really well, with splendid colors and warmth.This movie deserves more appreciation and recognition. It is that good."
10,The Secret of Kells,7,8 January 2011,"Gorgeous to watch, but the story is not quite there","I love animated films, so I was interested in seeing The Secret of Kells. Overall I really liked it. However, I do not think it is perfect, the story has a lovely idea and starts off very well, however there are parts that could have been less detached and done with more development, and it could have done with less of a politically correct note(I wouldn't have minded if it was there, it just got a tad heavy-handed). Also, I think the film sags in the pace in the middle. That said, it is a very worthwhile watch. The Secret of Kells does look simply gorgeous. The backgrounds are stunning, and the character designs are unique, but I loved the picturesque watercolour-like colours most of all. Another strong asset was the music, I loved the sweet, lyrical Celtic lilt to it. There is also a stirring prologue and while the story may be detached as I've said there isn't a complete lack of emotional attatchment, you do care for the characters and there are some touching and haunting moments and the film teaches some good lessons. The characters are likable with good personalities and the voice work especially from Brendan Gleeson is excellent. Overall, while lacking a tad in the story, it is a visually and musically rewarding animated film. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
11,The Secret of Kells,,8 February 2010,Rich and artistic visuals,"This Oscar nominated animated film is about a young boy in a Celtic walled village who has to prepare for his book by wandering out into the forbidden woods.""The Secret of Kells"" is visually rich and artistic. The characters are simple in design, almost minimalistic. This interestingly contrasts with the imaginative and stylish background, that never ceases to amaze. The background of the animation blends modern art and traditional art, and is only limited by the boundary of imagination. It takes viewers into a stunning flight of psychedelic journey. Though the plot may not be the strength of this animation, the artistic visuals makes up for it."
12,The Secret of Kells,9,26 December 2011,The Secret of Kells (2009),"WOW! An excellently awesome cinematic surprise. Secret of Kells fuses stylised animation, along with brilliant storytelling. The animation is the real star. It looks so seamless and beautiful. Every shot is a miniature work of art. The story itself tells a wonderful and inspiring tale about being too overprotective, and exploring the world around us. It was nice to see a film with a calm climax, like the work of Miyazaki, Secret of Kells refuses to stick to the formulaic layout as set by Disney. It's not all sunshine and roses here. The voice work is also incredible, with every character brought to life thanks to some real seasoned actors. A wonderful, brilliant film for all fans of animation."
13,The Secret of Kells,10,27 February 2010,A Masterpiece,"First animated feature film from Ireland is also one of the best animated films I've ever seen. Its a real warts and all story that is unlike any of the other Oscar nominees and any other film from this year or any other year.The plot of the film has the Abbot of Kells, a village in Ireland building a wall around his town to prevent the vikings from destroying the town should they ever attack. His nephew Brendon, is a young monk who does the best he can but meets the ire of his uncle by doing things in his own time. When a legendary illuminator Aidan arrives from a destroyed monastery, Brendon drifts towards him and his warm personality. Much to his uncle's chagrin Aiden offers to teach Brendon how to illuminate. In order to help Aidan work on his great book, saved from his destroyed monastery, Brendan goes out into the forest to get material to make ink. While outside the walls he meets Ashley, a forest spirit with whom he develops a friendship. Unfortunately the Abbot finds out that he went outside the wall and there is hell to pay. But lurking in the distance are the vikings...Forget what you think you know about this film you're wrong. Even what I've explained doesn't do this film justice. Its a simple story with so much more going on. This is a wonderful movie about trying to find your way in the world, over coming demons and finding the beauty of the world outside of the walls. (As the film says the world is a dangerous place and doesn't cease to be even if you build walls).Its a film that treats its audience as adults and deals with all of life including the darkness. There is death and destruction and joy and happiness. Its not sugar coated. People die. Monsters lurk. (it freaked out some of the kids), but in the end there is hope. Frankly the darkness in this film is completely unlike anything in any recent American film. Forget the ""sadness"" in a Pixar film, this is the real thing, and its refreshing and it shows how homogenized even Pixar has become.Its a Genndy Tartakovsky-esquire (Samurai Jack) animated film who's look is actually based upon the the Celtic art of the period. Its a film that looks unlike any other. Here again is another film that takes the movie frame and uses it in every way possible. the Images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible. Often the film manipulated things to make it look like a page in the legendary Book of Kells. Its stunningly beautiful and best described as art come to life.Director Tomm Moore has fashioned a film that is a masterpiece. I can't say more than that. Its a masterpiece. Its one of the best animated films I've ever run across."
14,The Secret of Kells,7,26 November 2010,I loved the artistry....the story itself was awfully strange.,"The art style of this animated film is arresting--you cannot see the film and not have a reaction. While hard to completely describe, it looks like the art of the Disney show ""Kim Possible"" merged with the art of Eric Carle. While I would never want a steady diet of this, it is quite creative and artistic--something that can't be said about most animation. Also, at times, it appears as if the characters are walking on letters from an ancient illuminated manuscript.The story is set in Ireland during the Middle Ages. A young orphan boy is being raised in by monks who are working on preserving their secrets through writing. When sent on a task to retrieve berries needed for an ink, the boy meets up with a very strange and magical girl. Who is she and what awaits them? Tune in and see this very strange film set during the era of Viking raids and monasticism.You notice I said 'strange'. It is NOT a film most kids would enjoy and even adults might find it all too bizarre. At about the time this was released, ""Ponyo"" was released here in the States--and by comparison, ""Ponyo"" is a pretty normal film!! Dark, confusing and not 100% kid-friendly, this is one you certainly wouldn't want to show to young kids, as they'd quickly get bored or confused or scared when the Vikings begin killing and plundering. As a weird history lesson infused with mysticism, it is pretty good, however...but you must be very patient, indeed, to enjoy this one.You won't confuse this one for ""Up""!"
15,The Secret of Kells,6,1 January 2012,"Style over substance - hides slow, unpolished story","(www.plasticpals.com) The Secret of Kells is an animated film made in 2009 that draws its inspiration from the Book of Kells, a celebrated 9th-century illuminated holy book. The art style mixes the iconic characters and intricately detailed backgrounds from Celtic tradition, and it's a welcome change from the glut of computer animated films. However, when you look passed the flashy veneer you're left with a much less polished story.Brendan is a young boy living in the fortified city of Kells under the watchful eye of his uncle, the Abbot. Although Brendan wants to apprentice with the older scribes, his uncle has little patience for books. The Abbot is building up the city's defences against an imminent attack from the invading Viking hordes. When a famous illuminator arrives in the city with the incomplete book of Kells, Brendan breaks his uncle's rules and leaves the city to collect the requirements for inking its pages.Inside the forest he befriends the fairy Aisling, who can transform into a wolf. Unfortunately the cultural divide between Aisling (a creature of pagan mythology) and Brendan (a devout Christian) is totally ignored and therefore wasted. Brendan tells no one of Aisling or her incredible powers which defy his community's religious beliefs. The scenes in the forest are easily the most interesting and visually exciting in the film, but they're few and far between. Another problem is the depiction of the Vikings, which are dehumanized monsters. This was certainly the popular perception of them for centuries, but a more even-handed approach would have been appreciated.In the end, The Secret of Kells is a disappointing film that builds to an anti-climactic ending. The purported magical qualities of the Book of Kells never materialize, leaving the viewer to conclude that the forgotten pagan mythology is more powerful. One can't help but feel that its story was entirely misplaced, and should have been centered around Celtic mythology. The few scenes which do involve Aisling and mythical monsters are the highlight of an otherwise dreary and slow moving plot that could have used some fine-tuning."
16,The Secret of Kells,7,10 August 2010,Brilliant animation not quite matched by the story,"There aren't too many Irish made Oscar nominated movies so I was looking forward to watching ""The Secret of Kells"" directed by Tomm Moore.The standard of animation was very high, breathtaking at times. The animators seemed to have been inspired by beauty of the Book of Kells itself as they have created some of the most colourful and vibrant images I've seen in a movie in a long time.The story is about a young boy (Brendan) living in the monastery of Kells where his uncle is the Abbot. His uncle is obsessed with building up the defences of the monastery to protect them from the marauding Vikings. Other monks are transcribing sacred manuscripts. A monk arrives from the island of Iona with an uncompleted book after Vikings have destroyed the monastery there. Brendan is talented at drawing and takes a lot of interest in the new monk and the book, much to the displeasure of his uncle. Aided by a fairy (Aisling) he meets in the forest Brendan finishes the book just before the Viking attack. Interestingly the story has elements of both Ireland's Christian and pagan heritage but the ending seems quite abrupt especially when the film is only seventy-five minutes long. Actors such as Brendan Gleeson and Mick Lally, both very familiar to Irish audiences, voice the main adult characters. Evan McGuire is excellent as Brendan.So a treat for animation fans while the story might spark curiosity in people to discover more about Irish heritage and history."
17,The Secret of Kells,10,11 September 2011,Thought provoking and visually stunning,"I watched this without expecting much, but after watching it once I ended up wanting to watch it several times again. The artwork and music are beautifully matched, as well as the tones in the voices. The dialogue and characters are also embedded with traditional Irish sayings and ideas, including a cat named ""pangur ban"" like the old Irish poem. Some people found the story slow, but I was definitely more impatient with the tired and predictable plot of Toy Story 3. The themes in Kells are philosophical and the story is non-traditional (aka not Disney) to better accommodate those themes. I also watched the Disney movie ""Up"" which won best animated film instead of the Secret of Kells that year. I enjoyed Up, but Kells is a much more impressive work of art and writing. Although, admittedly, if you have a very small attention span this is probably not the film for you. But if you have the capacity to enjoy something deeper than spectacle and slapstick, sit down with a glass of red wine or single malt whiskey and watch this film!!!!"
18,The Secret of Kells,8,10 April 2010,Different And Yet Great,"When I first watched the movie, the way everything was drawn kind of made me lower my expectations; that still didn't make me stop watching. I soon began to see that the two dimensional drawings came to life more and more as I watched. Watching the movie was magical.The story was also great. The characters and their looks and accents made me interested in what was going on - I especially loved Aisling. Brendan is the main character, a young boy who is adventurous like any other his age however has to face some of his fears to help finish a book.The whole movie was a magical, colorful, pictorial, unforgettable ride."
19,The Secret of Kells,7,15 January 2010,Celtic Beauty and a new worthy direction of modern animation!,"A beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic Celticism. Setting the story around the famous Book of Kels, believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of Iona, off the western coast of Scotland.Telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology. In hopes of recovering a lost artefact.The films true beauty lies in its' animation. Cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity. Deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant Cartoon Network series 'Samurai Jack' for its genius use of mark making and background depth, The Secret of Kels creates a consistently affective Celtic world living under the shadow of Viking invasion.The history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and Celtic-revivalist mysticism. The girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is, as she glides from branch to branch. Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary Cheshire Cat from Alice and Wonderland.The Secret of Kels is an absolute treat. For all genders, all ages, it's a lovely piece of family cinema.Don't expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed!"
20,The Secret of Kells,6,5 October 2010,"Fun movie, if you're not a fan of good plots.","Maybe it's because I'm an American used to epic build ups and epic conclusions when it comes to movies, so when I saw Secret of Kells, I was bothered to find one, but not the other. (That is, epic build up, but no epic conclusion) For the record, the movie is beautifully done. With fast, fluid animation, beautiful details and backgrounds, even the characters take on shapes of drawings found in the original Book of Kells. That's what brings you in and keeps you watching, but not the story. Most reviewers have already given the plot away so I won't mention it. When the book is discovered, I could feel the faith of the villagers, their absolute faith in this supposedly magic book. The uncle's fear, Brendan's frustration, the hopelessness. But then there are things they never explain. Where are Brendan's parents? Are we to assume Vikings killed them and that's why Brendan's uncle is so obsessed with keeping them out of the Abbey? I can ONLY assume because it's never revealed to us. Normally, I don't like too much exposition but in this case, it would've been nice. Also, this is a fantasy based on the history of the Book, right? It's pretty obvious with all the magic and monsters and wolves and fairies. So if we're going on fantasy logic, why didn't the book blind the viking? There was so much build up to the book being this amazing thing and then it's quickly reduced to being just a pretty book. True, that is what it is and this is a history. But it's a fantasy first in this case. And even if the book was just a book, why was Brendan's faith never tested? He's a kid and when a kid finds out that everything he's been spending all his time on and getting punished for is a lie, that kid is pretty ticked off. It would've been interesting to see Bredan's reaction to how the book isn't the wonderful, magic tome he's been told to see it as. Instead of seeing him blindly follow something he himself had seen torn apart like any other book. A book he wasted his time writing that did nothing to save the Abbey or his supposedly dead uncle. That doesn't make him a good hero, it makes him as bland as everyone else! The book is built up to be a miraculous Godsend but all it is is pretty pictures, but those pictures don't save hundreds of people from viking invasions or keep your uncle from dying. The ending is also a cop out. Oh, it was all worth the hundreds of dead people because the book was finished and the near-death uncle gets to look at it. Hoorah, hoo-flippin-rah. The movie had a chance to give us a good story. It didn't even need a happy ending, just a good resolution. With real magic book, a real reason to care if it's destroyed, and a real ending. Because instead of seeing the Book of Kells as this amazing relic, the movie makes it seem like it was a completely worthless book that resulted in needless deaths and endangerment with nothing good to back up all the terrible things it caused. When you make a movie based around something, make that something good or it'll just seem like a waste of time. But all that being said, The Secret of Kells WAS nice to look at. And before the abysmally disappointing ending, was enjoyable and fun to say the least."
21,The Secret of Kells,10,7 February 2010,"Gorgeous animated film, with some of the best color composition I've ever seen","The surprise nominee of this year's Best Animated Feature race at the Oscars. It's an Irish film by heart, but it was co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, with, I'm guessing, animators working in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory. The character design is a little reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis from a couple of years back, with very simple characters with thick, black outlines. This film is not in black and white. Oh no. What makes this film great is its use of color, simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors I've ever seen. The general design of the pictures is also a lot more geometrical, with characters who are basically rectangles or ovals. Much of the film can be spent playing find the circle - a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All of these geometrical designs have a purpose - the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (the Book of Kells is a real illuminated Bible; the art of the film is based on the drawings in it). The story of the film isn't especially deep, but it's a pretty good fantasy tale. Brendan is a young boy in Kells, a city surrounded by enormous walls, built by his uncle to keep out Vikings. A newcomer to Kells, Brother Aiden, inspires Brendan to take up illustrating. He also inspires him to do things like leave Kells and explore the nearby forest, within which lives a nymph. Bruno Coulais provides a fantastic score, almost as good as the one he did for Coraline, which I consider the very best of the year."
22,The Secret of Kells,8,28 November 2015,wonderful unique beautiful style,"Brendan is a young boy living in a walled medieval monastery town of Kells. He is apprenticed to monks illuminating books. Brother Aidan arrives with the Book of Iona that is suppose to shine a light beacon into the dark times. He is working on the final pages. Brendon's uncle Abbot Cellach is more obsessed with building a wall against invading northmen. Aidan sends Brendan out to find gall nuts to make ink. He is hounded by wolves and saved by the forest spirit Aisling. There is an evil in the forest called Crom Cruach. Meanwhile, barbarians from the north are brutally invading.The animation is wonderful with an old magic that fits the subject. The unique style is inspired by celtic art. It's like a beautiful children's book come to life. The characters are likable and their story is compelling."
23,The Secret of Kells,8,22 May 2015,"Unique, Intricate, Beautiful and Historical Animation","I had the pleasure of watching this in an Art House cinema in Aberdeen for my 16th birthday 2 months ago, being re-released as a celebration of Song of the Sea Tom Moore's new film (another STUNNING Gem by the way!) and I instantly fell in love with Moore's style and artistry. The film tells a true story about a book from an isle in Ireland with the most beautiful pictures and words written upon it's pages, describing it as ""to look upon heaven itself"". The book is brought to Kells, a medieval outpost which is constructing a great wall around it's monasteries and abbey to protect it from the Northern Invaders, (presumed to be the Vikings of Scandinavia who also pillaged Scotland.) The area is known to be full of monks and holy symbols, lead by Cellach, who anxiously awaits the attack. His young nephew Brendan, who usually spends his days with his ""brothers"" the other monks is swept up in the story of the book brought by it's author Brother Aiden, a monk from the Isle of Iona. Aiden and Brendan become close acquaintances and he entrusts his new apprentice to go into the forest with his white cat Pangur Bhan (from the old Irish poem) to collect green berries called gall nuts that produce the most beautiful emerald ink. Brendan is cornered by wolves in the process but is saved by a mysterious green eyed white spirit wolf who turns into her true form of a young girl about his age named Aisling. Aisling herself is in fact hundreds of years old and is a faerie of the forest which she is proud to call her own. She helps Brendan to collect the berries and although she isn't trusting of humans she forms a friendship with him and says he is welcome in her forest. Brendan must then look for the Eye of Crom, guarded by a dark ancient spirit Crom Crauch whom Aisling is deathly terrified of. The crystal eye will allow Brendan to concentrate when illustrating the Book. However, with Abbot Cellach under stress and the Vikings drawing ever nearer to the monastery, Brendan appears to have other things to worry about. This film is gorgeously animated, I felt like I was watching a painting all the way through. The Irish accents aren't difficult to understand at all and the Celtic rhythm of the music makes you feel as though you are there sitting in a bright green forest with Brendan and Aisling perched on a branch laughing along. The story flows very well, however the one problem I have with the film is you may need to be familiar with Celtic mythology. As a Scottish person I could understand most of it, but I think others had trouble keeping up. It was very well executed though so you kind of have it explained without to much exposition. The characters are all very 3 dimensional. The monks of the monastery are all very well designed with unique head shapes and voices and Brother Aiden is like a typical quirky grandfather figure. Brendan himself who is around 11 years of age is a very well written child character. He's intelligent but also clumsy and makes bad decisions and mistakes. His heart is kind and he looks to the good side most of the time. We see his spontaneous nature in the first scene as he attempts to catch an escaped goose, even going as far as to climb up the scaffolding. Aisling, the forest spirit is adorable. She's sweet but is also no nonsense and will not put up with a human stumbling across the forest which she guards as her home. She sees all animals as friends and my favourite scene is when she uses Pangur to help get the key to the cell Brendan is locked by Cellach his uncle, to prevent him from entering the forest again. She sings a Gaelic song to turn Pangur into a feline spirit and back again, allowing him to slip into Abbot Cellach's bed chamber without being seen or heard. Christian Mooney the voice actress for Aisling has a lovely voice. All the voice actors do a terrific job, especially the harsh tone of Abbot Cellach played by Brendan Gleeson. The Secret of Kells is a historical fantasy that can only be compared to the great works of Miyazaki. Watching it I drew parallels to Princess Mononoke, (wolves, girl of the woods, man and nature, the battle scenes) it's a very pretty film. It is quite dark in some places, the battle scene of the Viking invasion is frightening and a little graphic. I remember a mother who took her children out once or twice after seeing bodies fall off the scaffolding. It's a PG film but not for young kids. I would say for maybe 10 and up. Overall, this movie was amazing and I look forward to more of Moore."
24,The Secret of Kells,10,10 September 2014,"Visually beautiful film, a solid story and good character development","This film was nominated for the Oscar for Animated Feature. There will be spoilers ahead:This film is about the crafting of a work of art-the Book of Kells. It's a tale of one boy, two abbots with decidedly different world views and a most fascinating supernatural creature which becomes friends with the boy and saves him more than once.Brendan is the boy, a nephew of the Abbot Cellach, who has a goal bordering on mania, to build strong walls around Kells to keep barbarians at bay. He will not hear of doing anything other than building structure for defense. Brendan chaffs under this, wanting to work on manuscripts and his art.Enter two other characters: Aisling, the mystical creature which cares for the surrounding woodlands and befriends Brendan. She is a playful sort, at first suspicious of Brendan and then helpful. The other is a traveling abbot, keeper of a book begun decades ago and worked on painstakingly by brothers ever since. Aidan is friends with Cellach, but has a difference of opinion on the wisdom of building walls, having seen barbarians in action.Brendan helps Aidan on the book, which is yet unfinished. It is in seeking a type of berry for ink that Brendan meets Aisling. Aisling becomes a sort of protector to Brendan along the way.Various circumstances lead to Brendan and Aidan fleeing Kells and traveling around, taking time to work on and show off the book. The book passes on to Brendan as his responsibility and he returns to Kells as an adult to show the finished volume. The ending is most moving.This film is a beautifully realized work of art. The backgrounds, character design and animation are all quite lovely. It's worth watching more than once just to study the visuals more closely.The DVD release includes a full-length animatic, which is essentially a rough of the film using still drawings edited together to give the animators a basic idea of how the film will look. The film is well worth watching and the animatic should be of interest to anyone interested in the mechanics of animation. Most highly recommended."
25,The Secret of Kells,9,7 February 2011,Mesmerizing and beautiful adventure; I just wish it was longer.,"I was really excited about seeing The Secret of Kells. I knew it was nominated for Best Animated Picture, and it sounded enjoyable enough and I love animated movies in general, so I was eager to view it. I found out it was only 75 minutes long before I watched it, and while it does not take away from the enjoyableness of the film, making it longer could have added on to the adventure and made the movie even more vivacious and bubbly than it already was, because at times it seemed way too rushed and like they were just ready to get the film over with. I loved the fast pace and energy the film carried, because it kept me interested at all times, but they seemed to be running on nothing but visuals at some points and the creators seemed frustrated with their own movie, in a sense.However, The Secret of Kells does not disappoint. There are so many beautiful scenes, like I said, and artistic animation sketches that it is pleasing to the eye in every sense. The characters are really lovable as well. All of them are bright, energetic and original, aside from a few that are meant to be sullen, and each add a specific part to the story that creates a very nice adventure. I especially loved the character of Aisling, who even though she might be annoying to some, was probably my favorite thing about the movie, next to the vivid colors and designs. I did not care for a lot of the Christian overtones, but I had no idea what the story behind the Book of Kells even was until after the movie nor did I know it was a real story, so it took me by surprise, and that is just me personally, but for a movie about a ""Book of Gospel"", it held it down quite well. I think it could have been better by making it longer because we could have gotten a little more detail of the actual story, like they ended it abruptly, and it would have helped us better understand the whole situation, which that is not saying it is not understandable, but further information could have helped a lot. Yes, I know I just said that I did not care for the Christianity and now I am saying I wanted more information, but I did say they held down the religion well and made it to where it was not over the top, so if they did exactly that with more details, it would have been even better.Anyway, the story itself is not as great as the characters it holds and the wonderful visuals because of the shortness, but in the end, whether you enjoy The Secret of Kells or not is based on sheer entertainment, and that is all the film is. It is very entertaining, even if it's not perfect, because the whole film is excellently executed, in that manner at least. The movie can be interesting for people of all ages, religions, races and so forth, because it is just a fun film that knows how to give it's viewer(s) a good time if they are in the right mind to begin with. While it is not the best in any genre it could fall under, it is most definitely worth a recommendation for anyone who is interested in the movie itself or movies like this. Even though it has a handful of problems, all in my personal opinion, the characters, scenes and entertainment value make it a delight from beginning to end and the problems are mostly disregarded after you have such a wonderful time with it. I am pleased it gets a lot of good reception. It is just an enjoyable film in general, so that's the main point I am trying to make."
26,The Secret of Kells,7,7 February 2011,Gorgeous Irish animation movie,"The Secret of Kells is an Irish-French-Belgian-British animated feature film that revolves around the ""making"" of the famous ""Book of Kells"", an illustrated Irish illustrated Bible of the Middle Ages through the eyes of the young monk-child Brendan.The movie translates well into images and style the layout, functionality and way of life of old medieval abbeys in Ireland, and the religiosity dominating the period.The abbey in the movie, as well as its surroundings, are somewhat a reproduction of the old monastic place of Glendalough in Ireland, and even has the lighting and atmosphere you get when you visit it. In that regard, the movie is true to the surroundings, physical space, atmosphere, and history of this sort of abbeys, always in constant danger, at the beginning of the Middle Ages.This is old traditional drawing and coloring revamped and modernized that incorporates the cultural and historical background of the place into the storytelling. There is also a wonderful mix of Early-Christian and Pre-Christian Irish elements, myths and motives in the story and the visuals of the movie. The use of lightening is superb, especially in scenes in the forest, and it really recreates the mood and magic that surround Glendalough's woodlands. In fact, the drawing of the forest is luscious and extremely artistic, as well as all the design of the monastery, its yards and orchards despite their flatness and awkward perspectives. Also great is the dual coloring, so colorful and bright for the abbey and the forest, with a predominance of greens, while a mix of intense red/black mate colors are used for the scenes involving the barbarians and their attacks.The script is simple and somewhat predictable and the characters classic, but the story is so original and unconventional, the animation so artistic, the design so unique, the subject so educative, the music so beautiful, that the result is an uber-charming entertaining gorgeous movie for the whole family."
27,The Secret of Kells,9,24 November 2010,About this movie in one sentence...,"I just want to say one sentence. But unfortunately, to post a review on this site a minimum of 10 lines is required. If you are a fan of animation movies, this movie should go to your ""Must watch list"" with the highest priority.The entire had done a wonderful job in crafting this masterpiece of art.Well, what are you waiting for?

""This movie is absolutely enchanting and spell-binding with beautifully drawn backgrounds and characters, fascinating and eye-popping colors, and superb music score."""
28,The Secret of Kells,10,21 April 2010,Celtic immersion via awesome animation,"The Secret of Kells is one of the best animated features I've ever seen. And I'm talking about the big leagues here; it could share a platform with Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke without embarrassment. We know that either its primary market is Europe not America, or that its creators don't know much about working the American publicity machine - but who cares? My experience in the theater began at a fairly low level: the drawing started out relatively simple and the comedy pretty broad, with just enough artiness and special touches to make me think the animation was ""good"" (but not ""great""). But then it kept getting better ...and better ...and better. By the end, the ""wow"" factor had me sitting on the edge of my seat.It serves both young and old, rather than being targeted to any particular age range. (Do take a little caution and exercise some independent judgment about children under ten though: some of the red and black images with northmen and wolves and ravens, knives and sharp teeth and flaming arrows, are rather scary. Cringing, whimpering, hiding eyes, and even a few nightmares could result. Older viewers will ""get"" both the story and the emotion, even with the complete absence of any gore or bleeding or ""realistic"" violence and wounds; younger viewers though might get a little too caught up in the story.) The story is one of those fairly simplistic ones that doesn't sound like much in the retelling. Yet it forms the compelling armature around which everything else coheres. And despite the film being highly imaginative, the story is more or less ""true"" (even when what really happened doesn't make the most sense) .Many elements that aren't quite central to the story are just spun off in passing without comment, like vortexes in a wake. For example a white wolf easily morphs into a fairy when only a boy's looking, but almost always remains a white wolf when a grownup is around. This isn't explained or even commented on. It's just the way the magic works ...next.The spoken dialog sounds like American broadcast English; there's no brogues or ""thick accents"". It's completely accessible as is. There's absolutely no reason to wait for an alternate sound track or to look out for subtitles. (The dialog isn't critical anyway, as the story is so highly visual. Even my hearing disability muddling much of the dialog on my first viewing didn't disorient me at all.) The film communicates with visuals, deeply illustrating the old bromide ""a picture is worth a thousand words"". For example, in what I'll call the ""jailbreak scene"", a few wispy curlicues starting out of a character's mouth and the first phrase of a song lyric set up the entire plot for the next several minutes: magic spells, shape-shifting, tricks, tiptoeing, tension and fright, all follow naturally and understandably without any words at all. For another example, Aidan growing old and passing on his quest to Brendan is communicated clearly by nothing more than a few simple images such as footprints on a beach, gently lapping ocean waves, and a few extra wrinkles in a familiar face.As is often commented, the animation style is inspired by and closely related to the real Book of Kells. This is not just a film but an experience of cultural immersion.At first the animation appears to be mostly the 2D style with simple cartoon characters moving in front of highly painted backgrounds. But you quickly realize the single colors of the characters aren't really just single colors after all; the characters have ruddy cheeks, shadows cross them, dappled forest light dots them, even firelight is occasionally reflected from a face. Then you realize the backgrounds are not only fantastically detailed but not static either. Sometimes they contain the movement of secondary characters, or of burning fires, or of flowing water, or of stars wheeling through the heavens.There's a few bits of monochromatic line animation too. There's a 3D sequence with multiple layers, and even separately moving layers. And there are bits of other styles too -- have you ever seen animation in the style of those eastern orthodox icon painters? CGI is just another enhancer the animators have in their toolbox, and is used very subtly. I couldn't really tell what was CGI, but I have guesses. Falling snowflakes, a sea of tents, a swarm of bees, an explosion of butterflies, flames, flying arrows, and a horde of fallen leaves were probably CGI. Likely glints of light through a crystal was too, and maybe even some billowing smoke. Only one scene was obviously CGI to my eyes: at the end an illuminated majuscule rises above its page and ripples like a sail luffing in the breeze.Joe Sixpac: see this. Animation freaks: see it again."
29,The Secret of Kells,9,7 March 2010,Delightful and unusual animated feature is a true triumph,"This animated feature (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is surely one of the oddest subject ever for a movie: the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript, the book of Kells. In this fantastic retelling of that story, a prepubescent boy named Brendan, living in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a stern abbot who is worried preparing the defenses of the abbey from the impending attack by the feared vikings, must get into the forbidding surrounding forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named Aidan needs to finish the book. To do that task, in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling.Gorgeously and delicately drawn by hand (there is some computer animation in a few key passages) in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional Celtic art, and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of geometric shapes, this film is relentlessly strange, but is a good strange, not of the off putting variety but of the eye opening sort. If one were to nitpick - beyond some anachronisms, like an African monk in 9th century Ireland  one would have to say that the blend of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this movie never really coalesce. And the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad. That's why I cannot give them the highest ranking. But these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film."
30,The Secret of Kells,,5 February 2010,Animation and score are top-notch but the story is oddly detached,"A mysterious, ageless young female voice narrates in whispers(who we learn more about) the beginning of this film, and so we follow the story of young Brendan and his quest to complete the sacred text in the mysterious book of Kells (which is the 'light' what with an impending doom of war causing darkness to overshadow the village).The main protagonist Brendan is likable though was it really necessary to have animated bald Gollywog for Brother Assoua? Thankfully it's brief. Voice acting is pretty solid, the plot suffers from some undeveloped parts that could've been expanded upon a bit but the animation is beautifully stylised like an old Henri Rousseau painting mixed with old Saxon tapestries and is just so compelling to view. There's 'eye' imagery, light and darkness imagery and swirling patterns that and a gentle tinkling sound whenever Brendan's being creative related to the Book. There's interesting scenes such as an phosphorescent snake that moves like that old Nokia 'Snake' game.Likewise the score is fittingly Celtic and pastoral in sound (the use of harp, flute and fiddle are heard) and has some memorable leitmotifs. There's a beautiful lullaby type song heard in the film sung by the female narrator (introduced at the beginning) that's just lovely.My main issues are: more back story for Brendan's character and why his uncle is so strict, better closure for the characters and what exactly that creature in the cave was. It's a bit vague in places, as aforementioned as if it expects the audience to have prior knowledge of Irish folklore and the Book itself. Overall: an interesting watch that has moments of emotional involvement, horror and whimsy that gave me that warm feeling of nostalgia, like when I remember watching Watership Down (as this films opening prologue seems to be inspired by the opening prologue's animation in Watership Down). Not excellent on all levels to me, but so much more creative and inspired than the vast majority of production-line big studio animation out there. Definitely worth watching for the experience alone. 6.6/10"
31,The Secret of Kells,5,8 February 2010,"beautiful visuals, but overall disappointing story","If you are looking for something visually stunning, with great music soundtrack then look no further. Now for the story. The first act of the film is wonderful, you are introduced to the main characters and given well enough back story to figure out what is going on, and this goes well for the most part of the film. However, at about the middle of the story it feels as if the writer(s) decided to finish it up in 3 minutes and the entire structure seems to fall apart. We lose one of the most memorable character with no future reference of what is to happen to them. Then the story just takes off from there, in a bad way, with the ending leaving you with a ""what the heck just happened"" (also in a bad way). Over all the film had great promise, but failed in the long run."
32,The Secret of Kells,6,17 September 2014,Beautiful Animation Without Focus,"When people talk about how much they loved this movie, I feel like I somehow missed out. And I watched this movie from start to finish. Its sad I have to give it the same review I did Avatar - great visuals, poor plot.We've got excellent, colorful, stylized animation, with some of the best scenes of nature you'll see outside of a Ghibli film. But, at the end of the day, there's nothing in the plot to take away. Heck, it would have improved if it were a dialog-free short.I didn't particularly like our lead. I didn't hate him, but he's just not interesting, and kind of bratty. But the bigger failure here is his relationship with Aisling. Although she's a main character, she has surprisingly little impact on Aidan and the plot in general. She's a beautiful, powerful spirit of the forest...that could easily be written out of the film. *shrugs*There's numerous other nits I could pick. The whacky, mostly pointless abbots, an underwhelming villain, a perilous quest for a magnifying glass. I almost feel like I'm not giving it a fair chance, and I went in with good expectations. I just felt a visceral ""meh"" by the time it was done. I did give it some slack though, because, again, it is a beautiful movie. Fans of animation should give it a shot for that alone. Just don't expect great journeys or relationships. Appreciate it for what it is."
33,The Secret of Kells,,17 April 2010,An Irish Beauty,"""I've lived through many ages. I've seen suffering in the darkness. Yet I have seen beauty thrive in the most fragile of places. I have seen the book. The book that turns darkness into light."" Aisling (Christen Mooney) Writer/director Tomm Moore's Secret of Kells is an Irish animation more like a highly stylized, richly illustrated children's book than an historical look at the Book of Kells. Reverence for the illuminated manuscript so lovingly transcribed by Celtic monks in the post-Roman British era of Insular Art is there; characterization of the main players such as the Abbot Cellach (voice of Brendan Gleeson) is not there, as if the hand-drawn cells were the reason everyone is at the screening, not the characters.The abbot's nephew Brendan (voice of Evan McGuire) is a young apprentice scribe who eventually saves the manuscript and whose presence is continual through the film, a symbol of hope for Irish culture and a dramatic necessity given the flatness of the other characters. His relationship with the sprightly Aisling is childlike and then mystical as they grow apart with different missions defining their lives.The animation becomes as alive as the artwork with the arrival of the marauding Vikings, whose hulking, boxy blackness and menacing horns contrast with the richness of the forest green and the manuscript pages themselves. Sneaking in is a bit of CG to augment the busy background of Kells town and the manuscript.The beauty of the animation is similar to that of the book itself, whose Christian gospels and motifs are lavishly ornamented, far superior to any other Insular Art in its time. The colors of the film remind me of the richness in Sita Sings the Blues.The two-dimensional animation seems flat by contrast with the recent 3-D obsession, yet I was not interested in changing The Secret of Kells into a modern cinematic fad. Splendid 900 A.D. art is just fine, thank you."
34,The Secret of Kells,7,22 February 2010,"Colors, Colors and more Colors!","While watching this movie I was frustrated and distracted and by the end, I wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5. I thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on. Even my A.D.D couldn't keep up. It felt like a slight acid trip. Everything looked flat, there was no dimension to anything. There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie mid-way and smash my burned copy of this movie. But after I finish watching it, I went online to read up on the movie and I should have done a little research into this movie before watching.The Secret of Kells is loosely based on the true story about the original Book of Kells. A small boy, Brendan, is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written. This book will contain information that will help ""change darkness into light."" Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind huge stone walls. Taking place in the 8th century, Brendan's uncle, the Abbot of Kells, is trying to build the wall to keep the Vikings out. Brendan's uncle insist he help complete the wall, but a traveler and keeper of ""the book"" secretly trains Brendan to hone in on his illustration skills, and convinces him to complete ""the book"" and carry out it's word.The entire time I watched the movie I thought I was missing something because I didn't really understand what was going on. I figured I was just missing a piece of Irish history. A simple Google search taught me all I needed to know about the original Book of Kells. After reading many articles, my opinion of the movie greatly changed.The Book of Kells is a copied version of the first few books of the New Testament transcribed into Latin by Gaelic monks in Ireland in the 8th century. Along with it's paleographic and insular script, the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art, a type of early art form know for it's intricacy, complexity, and miniature illustrations. Much of the art in the Book of Kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time, flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective. But what makes the Book of Kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it's use of many colors.The Secret of Kells is very colorful. I originally thought the animation was flat and boring. It reminded me a lot of the cartoon Samurai Jack which also had a flat and ""amine"" look to it. Once I learned about the art styles of the Book of Kells, it's obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie. There are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit Brendan's mind. Whenever he goes into his imagination, circular shapes resembling the sun, cogs, clocks and wheels begin filling the screen. The edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles. Transitions are filled with color, and Celtic knots. From the trees to the floors, many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns.Clocking in at 70 minutes minus credits, The Secret of Kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people (maybe just children) interested. I think one has to generally be open-mined to The Secret of Kells as half art piece, half movie about history. Despite looking like it was animated with Adobe illustrator, It's a very nice looking movie. But based on the 20 films submitted for Oscar consideration, I don't think it was worth being nominated over Mary and Max.ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com"
35,The Secret of Kells,5,6 January 2013,Gorgeous and original animation but the PC police spoil the story....,"The animation style is both original, gorgeous and inspirational. I like how they took the art from medieval Bibles, in particular the Book of Kells, and created an entire animation style from it. Its highly original.Unfortunately the story is very disjointed. In particular due to the effort the writers made to make a story about a Christian Bible - The Book of Kells - and a Christian monastery without saying the word ""Bible"", ""Monastery"", ""Christ"", ""Christian"" or ""Jesus"". They also avoided using any kind of Christian symbolism throughout the story making sure nothing would indicate that a central character of the story was in fact the Christian Bible. One of the most frequently asked questions about this movie is ""what is the Book of Kells?"" I think that speaks to the political correctness of the movie.It is equivalent to writing a story about Abraham Lincoln and never mentioning him by name.A politically correct story with wonderful animation falling well short of what it could have been."
36,The Secret of Kells,5,3 April 2010,A Movie with a Particular Target Audience in Mind (doesn't include me),"The Secret of Kells (1:19, NR)  Borderline, 3rd string, originalThis whimsically hand-drawn film so obviously has its innocent little heart in the right place that I feel kind of bad giving it only a middling rating.It purports to be the story behind the 9th Century creation of the Book of Kells, a stunningly intricate illuminated copy of the 4 Christian gospels that is considered (with some justification) to be the most precious artistic treasure of Ireland. In reality, nobody knows who created the book  almost certainly more than 1 person  or exactly when, or even where. It spent most of its life at the abbey in Kells, but it's now available for public viewing in Dublin.A factual vacuum like this presents a perfect opportunity for imaginative filmmakers like Tomm Moore, Nora Twomey, and Fabrice Ziolkowski to engage in fantasy flights of speculation. They posit that the book was begun on the island of Iona and carried to Kells, only partly completed, by one Brother Aidan, fleeing from the depredations of the viking invaders. But Aidan had to leave behind his ""3rd eye"", which turns out to be a crystal that he used to magnify his work area so he could scribe at the sub-millimetre level. Now, however, his habitual winking good cheer is somewhat dampened by his realization that his eyes are too old, and his hand too unsteady, to continue the work. So he recruits callow Brother Brendan as his apprentice.Brendan is in awe of scriptural illumination generally and is transported beyond ecstasy at his first viewing of this masterwork: ""the work of angels"", he breathes. But he's not a free agent. His uncle, Abbot Cellach, is more concerned with fortifying the abbey's walls than with art or scholarship. He's not insensitive to the idea that civilization's cultural heritage needs to be preserved (as, indeed, Irish monasteries never get sufficient credit for doing), but he believes that the way to do it is via his intricately designed forerunner of the Maginot Line. And the abbot doesn't want Brendan wasting his time on manuscripts while there's construction to be done  and, of course, there's ALWAYS more construction to be done.So far this is all just historical speculation. It slides into the interstitial space between reality and fantasy when Brendan slips out of the abbey's walls to explore for the makings of new colored inks and a replacement magnifying crystal. He's aided in this by Aisling (pronounced Ashley), who may or may not be a young weregirl; all we know is that we never see her and the white wolf at EXACTLY the same time. And are those visions, dreams, hallucinations, or just bedazzled wonderment at the real world in the eyes of a boy who's seldom been exposed to it? The movie is coy.The animation is highly stylized. The vikings, for example, are rendered as looming black rectangles with eyes, swords, and no other detail. The opening scene, a literal goose chase, appears to have a welter of telephone poles in the background, but we soon discover that it's really supposed to be the ubiquitous scaffolding for the uncompleted wall. The wall itself is something no military engineer would have designed; it has swoops and curves and many low spots. This is visual poetry. It's not simply expository; it says ""look at me, look closely, pay attention"".This is clearly a work of love from people who truly appreciate the visual arts. If you're among them, you will find The Secret of Kells to be a small treasure.I, however, am not. I was looking for much more of a story and for sure some real examples of the book itself. That is, don't just TELL me it's beautiful and ornate, SHOW me; the movie never does. The plot is occasionally inchoate, especially the odd outdoor scenes with the wolves and cavern, where I still don't know what was supposed to be going on. The artwork mixes several different styles, which I found periodically jarring.But it's like nothing you've seen before, so it gets huge props for originality.After all is said and done, I end up planking it down at a 5, dead in the middle of my rating scale, a place normally inhabited by the merely mediocre. This is so inadequate. I need a way to illuminate that digit. Brendan, if you're not busy ..."
37,The Secret of Kells,8,17 February 2011,An absolutely beautiful allegory,"""The Secret of Kells"" is a highly stylized allegory about the value of constructive creation within a world that does not always value the very same constructive creation. As both stylized animation and allegory, this film presents some interpretive challenges to the viewer. Surface level and literal analysis of the story combined with comparative critique of this films animation to more technically advanced animation will almost inevitably lead to being underwhelmed. TSoK relies on being interpreted as symbol and metaphor. Should one choose this interpretive path, the film is far more rewarding than its simplicity would imply.The interpretive path that the film makers appear to intend required several assumptions. The first is that creativity as an under defined type or category is valuable in and of itself. The book, which is a central part of this story, is never really explained. Instead, the film focuses on the book as a symbol for the creativity and ""illumination"" of humanity. The film offers a way of understanding an object (a work of valuable creation) as opposed to expounding on the details of the object (an illuminated text of the synoptic gospels). A second assumption is that audience members will be able to distinguish between the strictures of a rigid belief system and the everyday practices of the people living in the system. In essence, the above sentence means that while a character may be ""Christian,"" he or she may also hold contradictory ""pagan"" beliefs that are common to the culture. In the case of this film, characters are from the village/abbey of Kells. They are clearly Christian yet also believe in the fairies and gods that would have cultural truck in 9th century Ireland. On the surface, this can appear to be contradictory. How is it that one can hold a rigid system of belief and espouse an antithetical set of concepts? No real answer is given, the audience is assumed to find such idiosyncratic behavior both normal and human. This particular assumption may be cause for some upset, but reflection about life confirms it as valid. A final assumption, and one which the story absolutely relies on, is that the audience is able to recognize and understand character archetypes. The Vikings of this story are grossly stylized to the point that they do not appear human. That said, the Vikings per se, are not the focus. The film spends more time exploring the effects of anti-creative forces on bastions of creativity. A failure to recognize that chaotic destruction is being personified reduces the film from allegorical tale to historically inaccurate cartoon.Hopefully, the above outlines how this film could be seen to have negative points. The story is open to being viewed as somewhat incoherent. In addition, the reliance on archetypes may draw criticism about historical accuracy. Yet, the above mentioned points are easily allowed when the film is viewed as a metaphorical allegory as opposed to a stylized representation of real events. As a metaphor, the film excels in its storytelling. To be more specific, this is a simple and familiar tale told exceptionally well. From the point of view of story, this film is similar to ""Gran Turino."" The story itself is not groundbreaking material. However, it maintains a subtle sense of the tragic and comedic while being presented in a highly effective way. In addition, the visuals of this film are breathtakingly beautiful. The animation is specifically stylized to reflect the artistic trends of medieval illuminators. Without going into much detail, the representation of depth was not highly refined in 9th century illumination. The scenes and figures in illuminated texts appear very two-dimensional. ""The Secret of Kells,"" is depicted almost entirely in 9th century period style. The effect is that, while rather flat, one is thoroughly immersed in the feeling of medieval artistic representation.When all is said and done, this is a beautiful film that lovingly presents an uplifting allegory. By allowing one's self to slip into metaphorical reflection, the film rewards the viewers with a multifaceted experience that is far greater than the sum of its parts. This film is not really fare for children. It is, rather, a thoughtful work providing insight into the value of creative efforts.On a personal note, I will be recommending this film to friends and family. While not a beer and pizza movie, ""The Secret of Kells,"" lends itself to sanguine discussion over a bottle or two of wine. Eight of ten stars."
38,The Secret of Kells,10,8 July 2010,A Celtic Tale For One And All,"As I have had the pleasure of seeing the original Book of Kells,twice, while on holiday in Ireland,when I heard about this film,I thought, ""I have to see it,if it plays in my area"". Imagine my surprise when it was announced that it would play for a full week at one of my local art cinemas. The Secret of Kells,an Irish,French,Belgian co production,is a beautifully illustrated & animated film,that although is something of a fantasy treatment of how the Book of Kells came to be,it is still worth seeking out. The story is of a young monk,Brendan,during Ireland's monastic period during the 8th century. The elder monk (Brendan's uncle) is more concerned about the very real possibility of invasion by the Vikings (who are never mentioned by name,instead referring them as the warriors)then about anything else. When the monastery of Kells receives a visit by another monk on the run from the Vikings,it is discovered that this monk possesses a mysterious book that could change day into night/good into bad,etc. Brendan is obsessed with the idea of finishing the book (although not without chagrin from his uncle). When young Brendan goes into the forest to find special ink berries to complete the book,he meets with a young faerie/spirit/nymph/sprite/take your choice,who resists Brendan (at first),but takes a liking to him and helps him find the berries. Will Brendan finish the book & rid the village of Kells from the invaders,forever? Tomm Moore & Nora Twomey co direct,from a screen play written by Fabrice Ziolkowski,from a story written by Tomm Moore. The film's breath taking art direction is by Ross Stewart. The film's music score is supplied by Bruno Coulais,with contributions by the Irish rock band,Kila. The voice talents are led by Brendan Gleeson,with Ewan McGuire,Christian Mooney,and many others. A real treat for those into Celtic culture,mysticism,or just a well animated film. Not rated by the MPAA,this film has some scary & intense moments that may frighten very young children."
39,The Secret of Kells,,14 November 2017,"An Enchanting, Alluring & Endlessly Endearing Delight","Enchanting, alluring & visually spellbinding, Cartoon Saloon's first foray into feature filmmaking is a beautifully animated & exquisitely scored fantasy that draws its inspiration from Irish mythology & art and is brought to life with such care, love & dedication that every frame of it qualifies as a gorgeously textured & geometrically satisfying work of wonder.The story of The Secret of Kells follows a young kid named Brendan who embarks on an adventure of a lifetime after an esteemed illuminator arrives on their doorstep, carrying with him an ancient but unfinished book, and enlists the kid as his apprentice. But in order to finish the magical book, he must overcome his deepest fears and must do so before their monastery is invaded by raiders.Directed by Tomm Moore & Nora Twomey, the animation style draws upon Irish art & culture and although the hand-drawn elements look deceptively simple in appearance, the attention to detail is breathtaking. The story is pretty straightforward, the fantasy elements brim with magical touch & feel, and while the characters may be a bit underdone, a few of them manage to make us invest in their journey.The animation is as unique as it is transcending and in an age where most animation studios try to emulate a realistic background, it's heartwarming to see Cartoon Saloon embracing the imperfect, childlike & ornamental sketch which is then refined to perfection with splendid use of colours & a truly mesmerising score, thus providing its visual & aural elements a distinctive artistic flair and yet it feels oddly familiar & intimate.On an overall scale, The Secret of Kells is a heartwarming, evocative & endlessly endearing delight that begins Cartoon Saloon's filmmaking journey on a high note and is one of the most beautiful & dazzling works of animation to grace the silver screen. The story itself may not be as immersive or gratifying as the skilfully illustrated world it takes place in but the sheer passion & creativity that's on display here makes sure that the viewers never look away from the screen for even a second."
40,The Secret of Kells,9,22 May 2017,A beautiful animation from Ireland,"This animated feature is set in the Abbey at Kells in Ireland and is centred on Brendon, the Abbot's nephew. Brendon is an apprentice working along the monks in the scriptorium as they illuminate various texts. He hears them talking about a great illuminator; Brother Aidan of Iona whose work, 'The Book of Iona' is beautiful beyond compare. After Vikings raid Iona, Brother Aiden escapes to Ireland with his book and makes his way to Kells. Here Brendan gets to know him and agrees to help him gather berries needed to make his ink. To do this he goes into the forest despite knowing that his uncle doesn't want him leaving the abbey. In the woods he meets Aisling, a forest spirit who helps him. He also learns of a dangerous spirit called Crom Cruach a spirit he will later have to confront before he starts to learn how to illuminate texts himself. Eventually the Vikings arrive at Kells and Brendon flees with Brother Aidan.This story about the creation of Ireland's famous 'Book of Kells' is an utter delight. The animation is great with detail to rival that of Japan's Studio Ghibli but with a distinctly Irish feel. The story is told well and I really liked the main characters; Brendon is a great protagonist; curious and adventurous without seeming overly precocious. Aisling is also a delight; it is a pity that her role isn't a bit larger as she is such a charming character. The rest of the cast of characters is interesting to. There are moments of real threat; these are fairly dark at times but not too frightening for younger viewers. The voice cast did a fine job bringing the characters to life; these characters have relatively simple but charming designs. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of animation looking for something a little different."
41,The Secret of Kells,9,11 July 2016,Dazzling mystery adventure: The Secret of Kells,"The Secret of Kells is an Irish-French-Belgian animated fantasy film, directed by Tom Moore. Just like it's sequel movie Song of the Sea, it's unlike anything we've seen on screen. The visuals are enchanting and fanciful. Brendan is an idealistic young boy who lives in the Abbey of Kells, which is an outpost surrounded by heavily fortified walls. Due to the threats of the Viking raids, his uncle, and the monks are sequestered on the abbey so Brendan has never stepped out of the walls. One day Brother Aidan comes to Kells with an unfinished sacred book of knowledge, which he refers to it as ""a beacon in these dark days"" of brutal attacks. Brendan is fascinated with the book and tries to help Brother Aidan complete the book, as his hands are too old and unsteady to finish the book. But to create the book, Brendan has to undertake a dangerous quest to obtain ink berries in the forest. Luckily he meets a woodland fairy Aisling, who helps him with him the mission. Brendan needs to face his fears and help Brother Aidan finish the book.As I've mentioned before, I thoroughly enjoyed the director's animation technique because it's charming and magical. The scenes were intricate and colorful. The vibrant and melodious Irish folk musical background scores increase the overall enchanting quality of this film.The cool thing about the story line is that it's partially right. There is a book called ""Book of Kells,"" which is a 9th century New Testament with brilliant embellishments. And it is considered as Ireland's National Treasure. At the end of the film, I also enjoyed how The Secret of Kells uses early Christian Theology to access to a wider audience as it illuminated the audience with its incredible and universal sentiment. The movie has a great message, from young viewers to old ones with striking imagery to captivate the audience."
42,The Secret of Kells,8,2 September 2015,The designer's revenge,"The animation was quite beautiful and, in a sense, it was the story of the film as well, as it's filled with symbolism about overcoming through imagination and artistic talent. The plot was quite complex, but without it being complicated. Most of the things happening are left to the interpretation of the viewer and, even if I am sure there are hints and references that I couldn't understand, I felt like most of it was not something to be explained, but something to inspire.There is love in all the design of the film and I kind of saw it as a metaphor for learning to see and love life in the face of adversity, but also as an expression of the designer's frustration with all the other people who are considered more important, like the scriptwriter or the software developer, hence the naughty title of the review.The pacing was most of the problem with the film, with things just happening for the sake of the animation sometimes, without terribly furthering the story. The story was beautiful enough, though, and even if it was more symbol than substance, I enjoyed it. The animation style is quite unique, even if it draws from several influences, and the Irish feel of it was refreshing as well."
43,The Secret of Kells,10,17 April 2015,A masterpiece,"I went into this expecting it to be just decent. But as the movie went on I started loving it more and more. Even whispering ""Oh my goodness"" to myself near the end. Why? Because it's so gorgeously made. And it had me captivated like I was a little kid (I'm 35). Sure, the story holds no surprises - I would refer to it as 'classic storytelling'. It's the way it is told, though, that is the whole deal here. And that is just - like I said - gorgeous, even epic at times. A true work of art.The attention to detail has been mentioned before. I would like to add the use of color and also the different techniques and materials used in the drawing. All of it is done with such taste and skill. Plus I find the signature style very pleasant to look at.Then there is the use of sound and music. It has pleasure, magic and downright terror in it. Really well done.I watched this on my laptop and it got me captivated so I can only guess what the viewing experience on a big screen would be. For me, this was like seeing Finding Nemo or Wall-E for the first time - that gut sense of awe at what human hands can make. Having seen the actual Book of Kells, in Dublin, and being a lover of illuminated manuscripts in general, it's pretty much that same awe one feels at what human hands and imagination combined can achieve. This deserves to be as famous as Pixar and Ghibli."
44,The Secret of Kells,8,10 January 2015,Lovely Visualization,"I've enjoyed the movie alongside the scores from the beginning until the very end. But the only problem was the plot. It's very simple and straight forward- probably like one of the Grim's tales where not all details are explained thoroughly but are vague and left for the viewer to imagine the wondrous ""Book"" as Aidan views it to be. It's true I'm complimenting such aspect but I sort of liked a little more play in the plot- keep it vague but if it was conducted more smoothly (in terms of events and some hints -just a tad bit-) it would have been perfect. It's a beautiful movie that will warm you up needless to say."
45,The Secret of Kells,7,3 November 2014,The world they live in isn't perfect but it is still a vibrant world.,"The Secret of Kells (2009) is quite unusual but interesting. It has beautiful art direction, both colorful and traditional, and a fictional story of how the Book of Kells is miraculously created. After watching it for some time, it feels like as if we are being teleported into their enchanting world.Aside from the visuals, this animated feature has serene music which makes the whole film feels otherworldly. It is magical and we certainly can have a glimpse of the lives of the Kells in the eighth century. Even just a short screen time of the many locations in The Abbey of Kells, it is already able to show the ancient civilisation of the Kells; the abbey is a monastery that shelters people from harm and there is also a scriptorium dedicated to the writing, copying and illuminating of manuscripts. We can see how the society in that era works and live interdependent.The characters in The Secret of Kells (2009) comes in all sizes and shapes but the main characters such as Aisling and Brendan are particularly sweet and innocent. If I have to mention, my favorite characters would be Aisling and the odd-eyed cat Pangur Bán.For instance, we should not forsake what we choose to believe in and we will not know what the world can offer until we explore.In brief, I love the art and backstory of this film. It is sad that the world they live in isn't perfect but it is still a vibrant world. There are only two things I would complain is that why there is no information on the contents of the completed Book of Iona (Kells) and this film is too short!"
46,The Secret of Kells,10,20 July 2014,Gorgeous,"I always love animation with different imagination with we see in daily animation. Here we saw magical colors spreads blowing our eyes by its beautiful light composition. And the ending is the best one. All it could be said in one word: gorgeous. But the story just so lame, hard to catch any message here. Or maybe it hidden and I'm too stupid to know. Very hard to know the meaning of pictures there and no alphabetical on the book. The Aisling song sang in unspeakable language. If anyone has it lyric please reply me. Its beautiful song, and voice, and I hope it meaning. Aisling voice is remarkably a picture of spirit, specially the giggles. Enjoy :)"
47,The Secret of Kells,9,20 June 2014,"Beautiful Animation, thin story...","This is one of the most beautiful animations I have _ever_ seen. It is hard to describe what makes this such a wonderful watch. You will just have to see it for yourself. Just let me say that much: They tried to translate the celtic art-style into an modern animation and they had a fantastic success with it. There is, however, one major flaw in this movie. Although the animation and everything else manages to outshine this problem greatly: The plot feels a bit thin, like the first few chapters of a book. Don't get me wrong! If you manage to stretch out the first third of a book and make it that entertaining you did a fantastic job. But as the movie neared it's end, it skipped over several years in a short (yet beautiful) montage. I felt disappointed as I realized that the movie was nearing its end, because I really wanted the story to continue. I wanted to see those skipped years, or at least a 'To be continued...' on the screen... but the film ended shortly after that montage and it was clear that there wasn't going to be another one."
48,The Secret of Kells,9,3 January 2014,Visually stunning,"A really beautiful cartoon movie. Full of amazing Celtic designs woven into the background. I enjoyed the Irish Trad music and the wonderful characters especially Aisling the fairy. As a fan of anime, I definitely enjoyed the unique drawing style. My only complaint is I wish the movie was longer. I would love to see more movies in this style about other Irish legends as there are many that are very interesting and would make great movies. Overall if you like Ireland and/or Irish art design you will love this movie.P.S. I have seen the Book of Kells and it really is very beautiful"
49,The Secret of Kells,10,27 December 2013,A must see!,"It starts out rather creepy, with a child like voice whispering with dark images being displayed. It's the story though that has my attention, that and the artwork. The story is about a young boy who never seen the outside world, but one day has a chance to take it. His world inside the walls is dark and even though he has friends with the other monks, he himself sticks with what his abbot says about the outside world being dangerous.It's a story about adventure and life and is a rather nice refresher from the other stuff I've been reading.The world they live in is Celtic but yet we have a Mexican and an African man who seems to be part of the monks so I'm not sure exactly why they did that.Everything was made to look similar to an old tapestry, Things seem rather stiff and yet the movements are so fluid. The bodies move like they are pieces of cloth. And everything has a defining line to them.The voices work nicely with the story and the characters. Really I'm at a loss to what I can say that's really that bad about it. It's a very good show. What are you doing here? GO WATCH IT!"
50,The Secret of Kells,9,28 November 2013,You should definitely see this movie!!,"This movie is animation gold. It's story might seem a bit cliché at first but it is told beautifully and with lots of story development to the characters and the places they go to. The main character, Brendon, is very likable and has lots of development. The same goes with the rest of the characters. The animation is very beautiful with its 2d animation. It looks like a painting and has many cool shots with 2d in them. There is some computer animation but that doesn't outnumber the 2d animation by much. With all that said, the ending might have been a bit rushed but it was truly satisfying. This movie sometimes made me tear up with how sad it could get. It was also not afraid to get into really dark matters. This is a definite must see for any animation fan or person in general. When you see this movie, you'll know how classic animation should be used more often."
51,The Secret of Kells,10,25 July 2013,Beautiful and moving,"I watched this film with my four-year-old daughter and we both loved it. While the story is intriguing and has an interesting historical basis, the beauty of the animation, especially the background paintings, was perhaps the real highlight for me. My daughter, on the other hand, especially loved the tenuous friendship that developed between the boy Brendan and the wood fairy Aisling. A few moments involving wolves and Vikings were a bit intense and caused my daughter to cover her eyes, but there is nothing graphic or objectionable. I think some viewers may wish that more loose ends get tied up in the end, but my daughter and I enjoyed talking about what it all meant. A rare film that is both artistically satisfying and captivating for kids."
52,The Secret of Kells,10,8 February 2013,"Beautiful, emotional and mesmerising","Lets get one thing straight, if you are looking for a cartoon with funny characters, smart cracks, one liners and heroes; this is not the film for you. If you are looking for a cartoon that is historically accurate and has epic battle scenes and happy endings; this is not the film for you.In-fact I would not recommend this film to children at all.If you're going to watching this film, watch it for the artwork and the music. Don't get me wrong, the plot is very good, it is at times funny, sad, happy and scary, but the artwork is where it gets truly sensational. You can pause this film at almost any point and see beauty.If you can't take cartoons seriously, or if you don't like quirky artwork and Celtic music, Don't Bother."
53,The Secret of Kells,8,26 January 2013,"Nice, but not for young ones.","I loved it, but it scared the pants off my 8 year old. He'll be creeping down the stairs tonight. Wonderful scary artwork for kids, but abstract intellectual big idea that the kids entirely miss.Christian themed, with a Christian message, but the vision and presentation are ancient Pagan mythology. Puts the cultural systems on equal footing in a battle for ascension. For instance the chief ally of the boy hero is a wood fairy, and the foe is an Irish god that consumed the fairy's parents. Toward the end, after the Vikings slaughter screaming villagers, fairy sends wolves to the rescue.The voices and music are wonderful."
54,The Secret of Kells,9,16 December 2012,The Secret of Kells: A Light in the Darkness,"Darkness is the unknown. The unknown is darkness. Synonymous with terror and that which we cannot comprehend, these two entities cloud the human mind in horror and suffocate all thoughts with dread. It is everywhere. Do we dare to combat the darkness around us? How can we have any hope? What can mankind do to fight that which remains unseen? The answer, while not always easy, is mysteriously simple. To fight the darkness, one must simply turn on the light. The Secret of Kells¸ an animated masterpiece from 2009, pierces the darkness with a light that is nothing short of blinding.From the first frame of animation to the credits' final text, The Secret of Kells plunges its audience into a world of glorious animation and color. Set against the backdrop of the Vikings' Ireland invasion, it follows Brendan, a young monk who longs to join the elders in their work of illuminating, that is, copying down scriptures. Brendan's uncle, the Abbot of Kells, is not interested in illuminating; instead he is pushing all the Abbey members to construct a wall. This wall is meant to protect Kells from the impending Viking raid. When a masterful and legendary illuminator arrives from Iona, Brendan is given the opportunity to have someone teach him. What follows is a quest involving the forest around Kells, ancient evils, and a mysterious book.The motion picture flows in a way that no film has before. Every shot and scene evokes an intentional feeling. Shadows come to life when stories are told. Angles are twisted when the mood changes. One setting could be tranquil in the film's beginning, yet turn to a terrifying nightmare later on. Shades and lights move in ways that create a picture which does not cease to amaze. It is not merely the characters which are alive  it is the story. Every piece of the plot's fabric is woven through the animation in such a way that the tale itself is awake. It is not without reason that Kells was nominated for best animated feature at the 82nd Annual Academy Awards.Besides the animation itself  something on par with Walt Disney's greatest works  The Secret of Kells presents its audience with scenes that will either live in or haunt them for the rest of their lives. Deaths are not glossed over. The Viking brutality is not ignored. Contrarily, it is depicted in detail, doing all but showing horrific images. These scenes are matched only by the heartwarming sights which balance them. Brendan's first woodland exploration, for instance, grows from a childlike curiosity to a gorgeous spectacle in a matter of minutes as he climbs a tree and breaks the forest canopy. A green sea surrounds him, and the breathtaking animation does all but hypnotize the audience with wonder.Of course, beauty can exist only if ugliness is there for it to stand out against, just as darkness must stand out against light. More so than the stunning animation or the wondrous emotions, the film's single aspect which is the jewel of its crown is its iconic symbolism: light and darkness. Unbeknownst to many, the Book of Kells is an actual historic document. It is a detailed copy of the four Christian gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. What is intriguing about this book is that its ancient origins are a mystery. The Secret of Kells depicts its fictional creation as it is passed from a masterful illuminator to a young monk as he begins to learn illumination. The more that Brendan learns to love the trade, the more he begins to understand what it means to illuminate the darkness with light. In the climax, where death is only inches away, Brendan stands firm in the light and takes a stand against the blackness facing him. This iconic moment perfectly depicts what it means to fight the unknown and to use light to wage warfare against darkness.The Secret of Kells is, in a word, awe-inspiring. When it is not sweeping the audience away with its animation, it is devastating them with tear-jerking moments. When it is not inspiring adrenaline-soaked tension, it is warming hearts. In an almost supernatural way, everyday darkness is destroyed, if only temporarily, by the this film's light as it captivates the viewers. In a very real way, The Secret of Kells is a tiny yet beautiful light, doing its best to illuminate the world of cinema."
55,The Secret of Kells,10,25 November 2012,Animation Is Awesome,"The animation is a lot like ""Kim Possible"" crossed with a little ""Samurai Jack"" with some ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" in the background. In short, it came together splendidly. The mixing of the flat foreground with the occasional intricate animation created the effect of a ""pop-up"" stained glass book, if that were possible. The story was also very well told and left enough mystery to keep it interesting through to the end. The only complaint that I could possibly have with this movie is that... well, it was too short, although the briefness of the story was also a relief from a few of the dragged out videos made today. A truly amazing and touching tale that I would definitely recommend to anyone who appreciates animation."
56,The Secret of Kells,10,13 November 2012,"Unique, beautiful, captivating - you really should watch this","Based on a real illuminated manuscript from the middle ages this fantasy story is rich in classic themes and story lines. Its telling however is unique and absolutely engrossing, great for kids and adults alike. The animation really sets it apart from other features. This is definitely not a cookie-cutter Hollywood animated feature. Rather than using the more common 3d over the top animation style, the artists instead create a somewhat flat-looking 2d world, which at first seems overly simplified. That impression soon changes as the story sucks you in, and the animation starts layering scenes with more and more rich and varied effects and graphics, taking 2d animation to its highest and most imaginative limits. Sorry for the hyperbole, you'll just have to watch this and you'll know what I mean."
57,The Secret of Kells,9,6 September 2011,It's just marvelous,"I've just finished watching this movie with tears in my eyes. I will not detail here how I've got astonished of this animation, no, I beseech you to discover it for yourself.The plot is simple. It's about a kid living on a religious fortress surrounded by a mysterious forest, while his uncle prepare the defenses against bad men looking for plunder. When an old man with a mythical book arrives, the kid joins an adventure that will change his live forever. I think as a father that isn't nothing in the world as beautiful as telling an interesting story to an eager child, and while I was watching I found myself as a child."
58,The Secret of Kells,,13 August 2011,A Marvel,"I don't remember ever hearing about The Secret of Kells. All I ever heard of it was it's nomination for Best Animated Film. A few weeks ago I saw it at my local Blockbuster and decided to give it a look. And I can honestly say, that was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time.The Secret of Kells tells its story during the time when the Vikings were invading Ireland and the creation of the Book of Kells(an illuminated manuscript of the Bible written in Latin). Brendan is a young boy and apprentice illuminator who lives in Kells with his uncle Cellach, the Abbot of Kells. The Abbot is building a wall around Kells to prepare for the Vikings arrival and puts everything else aside. When a fellow illuminator Brother Aidan, with his Persian cat Pangur Ban, arrives in Kells he takes Brendan under his wing and tells him about the Book of Iona. He needs special ink to complete a page in the book from berries that only grow in the forest outside the walls(which the Abott has forbidden anyone to enter). Brendan goes to get it for him and encounters a young girl named Aisling, a fairy living in the forest. She befriends Brendan and gives him the berries he was searching for. With the ink created Aiden informs Brendan that he cannot finish the book himself due to his failing eyes and hands and he tutors Brendan to finish it for him. The Vikings are fast approaching Kells though, and Brendan is under the constant watch of his compassionate yet firm uncle. He will need to complete the book either before the Vikings arrive, or before his uncle finds out about his visits to the forest.This film is phenomenal. It's always a nice refresher to see a traditionally animated film in this day and age and this film does not disappoint in its animation. Simply put, it's gorgeous. From the scenes in the forest, to the pages of the Book of Kells everything is detailed wonderfully. The plot itself transcends from a bright atmosphere in the beginning to a rather dark one near the end which I found great. The voice acting is also great since nearly all the voices were done with Irish actors. The detail of Christianity and Celtic Mythology is very well done also. The Secret of Kells is just a marvel through and through, I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.9.5 leaning towards a 10."
59,The Secret of Kells,10,20 May 2011,Excellent storytelling,"Having seen many an animated film, with a historical perspective, i was as eager to find substance of original storytelling, that i was to find original animation, when i first saw the cover of The secret of Kells.2 min. passed of this fantastic animated film, and i knew that this was to be one of my all time favorites.BREATHTAKING animated style. Not your well-known polished animation. Dreamworks flicks are a chapter in animation for it self... but seeing tons of animated features in the same style, it all gets a bit ""boring"".The Secrets of Kells are a MUST SEE film, for ALL interested in the Nordic and European history.For once its not a romantic viking story. The vikings are not heroic warriors fighting for the better good of the world. This time ( and about time ) the story is told from the ""other"" perspective.I my self, has the thickest viking-blood running thru my soul and body, and as the historic freak i am, this film tells a more true story.The story of illumination of the spirit, mind and about the importance of giving it all away for the better good. Don't keep knowledge and wisdom for your self... set it free to all around you.The secrets of Kells is no secret. Its an awakening if you like a good story, told in a magnificent animation style."
60,The Secret of Kells,9,3 May 2011,"Delightful, Charming, Accomplished Animation with a Creamy, Golden, Ethical Center","I should preface my review by stating that I only give it a 9 rating instead of a 10 because I feel perfection should always remain unattainable. But certainly in the realms of animation, storytelling, and world-immersion, ""The Secret of Kells"" excels nearly all Hollywood prefabricated animated movies of the past 25 years.From the lush and almost pungent colors, to the stark and exaggerated shapes and dimensions, to the fluid and surreal movements, the animation in this film falls second to none for vision, distinction, and uniqueness. Those looking for a photo-realistic or purely verisimilar approach to animation should most definitely look elsewhere, since the style, nuance, character, and idiosyncrasy of ""The Secret of Kells"" do not fall in the realm of most contemporary, digitally enhanced, video game-lookalikes presented by the Hollywood studio-industrial complex and acting as the next wave in dumbing down our cultural discourse and homogenizing the human imagination.In addition, the themes of friendship, community, daring, assertiveness, and communion with the earth and all her creatures allow the aesthetically pleasing animation to find an equal complement in thematic richness and meaning. The character of Aisling, while not altogether unproblematic for her self-sacrificial tendencies, nevertheless offers children, young people, and anyone with an open mind and heart the opportunity to hear the voice of earth's children in a language any English-speaker can comprehend.In short, ""The Secret of Kells"" offers great aesthetic, empathetic, and ethical potential to anyone looking for an experience of beauty and meaning. You've been warned."
61,The Secret of Kells,10,28 January 2011,Astoundingly beautiful,"Long ago in the secluded heavily fortified monastery of Kells lived a spectacular boy named Brendan. With the surrounding world covered in darkness and fire of the Normand invasions everyone lives in fear of war, blood and death. But besides these mortal perils work the illuminators, who are charged in creation a book of immense power. One capable of changing darkness into light. After the fall of a distant monastery brother Aidan appears in Kells with the unfinished book. Impressed by the boy Aidan asks Brendan to search for a special berry in the forest surrounding the fortifications. There he meets a mystical and magical young girl called Aisling. Together they venture through various perils in an attempt to finish the book.But words do not do justice to this engrossing and captivating animation. A joy for all possible senses ""The Secret of Kells"" excels within its genre, as something visually stunning as well as brimming with passion, love, warmth and beauty. Ultimately an experience in lyrical filmmaking that has to be viewed, not described. The script itself does feel a bit fragmented, but the general atmosphere of the movie seems to push away any need for a more expanded story or additional character layers (very much based on archetypes). All in all the movie is told like the Celtic fairy tale it is and manages to never once leave its meticulously created realm of on-screen magic.The animation is a true work of genius and the countless animators working on the movie deserve accolades for creating a real breakthrough movie, which shows others how to escape the confines standardised animation. The best thing that has happened in animation since the rise of Hayao Miyazaki.Absolutely recommended viewing. Especially if you have kids."
62,The Secret of Kells,5,28 December 2010,Awesome artwork but too politically correct,"The Secret of Kells was given to me as a Christmas gift from my daughter. The artwork is really very lovely: the reproductions of some of the actual pages from the book of Kells are true to the originals and stunning: the art gets a 10. HOWEVER; the story reeked of excessive and misguided political correctness: that gets a 1. Why was it that Ireland and the New Testament were NEVER ONCE even mentioned? It is sad how pedophiles in the clergy have greatly tarnished the Catholic faith, but honestly: the ""illumination"" of the book of Kells were the teachings of Christ, not the meticulously intricate illustrations. And if the squalid living conditions of the people were depicted realistically why not the images of the Vikings? They were people too, terrifying and blood thirsty it's true, but they were not horned monsters or evil spirits. Did they really have to be so completely dehumanized? And there might have been an Italian monk at the Abby way back then, but I seriously doubt that there would have been a big black monk there at that time. Talk about an insulting sterio-type! Why was he drawn so huge and with such thick lips? Incredible! Why is it so hard to be truthful? Did the producers think that kids couldn't handle it? Or were they just afraid of critics? This dishonesty is not just distracting it makes the story completely LAME!"
63,The Secret of Kells,9,26 December 2017,Turn the Darkness into Light,"Every now and then, you find an animated film that should have gotten far more widespread love than it deserved, and that film is the Oscar nominated animated Irish film, The Secret of Kells. Despite meeting with rave reviews, it simply did not get enough worldwide attention outside its home country, or even outside Europe. Nonetheless, this is a beautiful movie that offers just the right amount of substance to click with audiences.The main story centers around the abbot Cellach of Kells, who is very determined to keep the small village protected by a giant wall from a possible viking attack. Meanwhile, his nephew Brendan gains a golden opportunity to embrace his imagination in the abbey's scriptorium to help famous illustrator Aidan finish the famous book of Kells to keep knowledge going. Such tasks include dodging wall buildings, venturing into the forbidden forest in search of berries to make ink, and getting help from the forest spirit Aisling. Simple enough storyline, yet what really elevates the movie is the artistry and passion displayed on the screen. The artwork is a gorgeous throwback to ancient illustrations created in a more geometric albeit symbolic design rather than realism. The character designs look like they came out of an Irish painting, the character animation is pretty smooth and crisp, and the use of color is astonishing, from the more simple calm green Irish atmosphere, to the darkish red tones for the vikings, to even a great use of mellow blue to emphasize sadness and fear.As for the characters, pretty much all of them are well thought out and intriguing. Brendan is the curious lad who grows enthusiastically fascinated by the book and how it is made (as well as the audience), Aisling does mess with Brendan at first but soon helps him complete the book to shine light in the dark, and Cellach may be stern and tough but is only trying to protect himself and his people from vikings out of fear which isolated him from the real magic of the book. Finally, there's Brother Aidan of Iona; despite showing his old age, he is very determined to keep all knowledge in literature and will do anything to keep such work passed on so that the language of art and literature won't be forgotten. The other characters like Pangur Ban and the other illuminator monks do serve a good purpose in keeping the book's magic in tact and by being good supporters for Brendan along the way.Overall, by blending fantasy and darkness with phenomenal illustration, The Secret of Kells is an all around gorgeous film with a clever story, engaging characters, interesting philosophies on Celtic culture, breathtaking animation, and sublime music. While I do think it could have been longer to answer a few character arcs and to pad the ending out a little bit, I still deem it a very wonderful film with great respect for art and knowledge. Had it not been for wise men and literature, there's a good chance knowledge would be forgotten and the darkness would not be lifted, which is something me must relinquish to remember the hope that lies in the world. As someone who wishes to bring light into people's eyes with his own work, I deem this movie a big influence, and I thank it for inspiring me to create cleverly imaginative stories and for giving me an interest in Irish culture itself."
64,The Secret of Kells,7,21 December 2017,The Secret of Kells,"The style is fully realized, flat, detailed and pure with its mythology, it manages to enthrall the viewer with the story of such magnificent book."
65,The Secret of Kells,10,4 May 2017,The best cartoon ever.,"As far as I know this is the best cartoon, and one of the best movies at all, ever! Very authentic Celtic/Irish, and made in Ireland. Amazing graphics, full of all kinds of Irish knots, and things. It has a lot of meaning, and morals to it. It is very Catholic in nature, and to lend credence to this statement I will tell you that this movie was recommended to me by the official Vatican newspaper! If a movie could ever be called truly ""magical"", it must be this one."
66,The Secret of Kells,4,7 May 2009,Not great but has moments of pure beauty,"There are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it's not very good. Limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal. The character design looks like a cross between the original Star Wars Clone Wars and Disney's Kim Possible, (Brendan, the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to Ron Stoppable in Kim Possible) Background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark, yet by today's standards, overall it is still poor and cheap looking. Many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern European or Nordic animation from the mid 80's, nice in its own way but for modern child audiences, used to CG slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind, is sure to disappoint. The story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors aren't overly impressive, noticeably the usually brilliant Brendan Gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part. There are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly cliché and stereotypically racist. However, some of the characters are good, the Viking villains, although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound. There is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by Wolves from a Viking attack that is very nicely put together. The look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film Watership Down including a blatant rip off/homage to the Ghost Rabbit of Inlay. The look is also clearly and obviously inspired by Gaelic/Celtic/Anglo Saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look. The film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner, including a pretty match cut and a large scale Viking attack that is very moody and impressive. Best of all though is the music, much of the background music is melodic and moving, specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers. If the whole film was as poetic as this moment, (and it tries,) then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience, but instead it isn't a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn't stand up to modern animation standards. Overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways, but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment. Oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time, not sure how that was possible."
67,The Secret of Kells,4,24 November 2016,"It was good, starting to become great, up until the point that they trashed it.","I loved it-in the beginning, at least. It started out okay. Intro, boy living in walled town/village/whatever its called, good. Plot builds, gets more exciting and engaging, friendship with fairy, drawing, attacked by vikings, fleeing into the woods, and... cut. I feel like this is where it all went wrong. I was expecting at least another half-hour of the movie, but I paused it and saw that ten minutes were left instead. The main character is rescued by Ashley, (who doesn't speak to him again for the remainder of the movie) and I could see the friendship that half of the movie had been cultivating go down the metaphorical toilet bowl. He doesn't ask her to hide them from the vikings, and instead just runs, and runs, and runs... (for like, 10+ years)and eventually shows back up at Kells, sees his uncle, etc. Another thing I'm annoyed about is that how the Abbot and the man working on the book seemed to know each other, but their possible past relationship was never explained or made clear. Overall, I felt like this movie started out well, began to become excellent, and then the people making it ran out of money and had to do a rush job to finish it, which pretty much trashed everything up to that point."
68,The Secret of Kells,,3 December 2015,"Breathtaking visuals, mythological story","The Secret of Kells is the first film made by the Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon, and the first film directed by Tomm Moore. And as far as debut films go, this is simply stunning. Telling the fictitious origin story for the historical Book of Kells, it is probably the animated movie with the most striking visual style I've ever seen. European medieval paintings suddenly spring to life on screen with this film, with most of the backgrounds and character designs heavily mimicking medieval designs, but with a distinct cartoonish slant.And it looks gorgeous! Every frame of this film is a painting ready to be hanged on a wall, and what makes it even better is the fact that the film's story talks about the illustration of a book. The Book of Kells has been a long time project for a Master Illustrator Aidan, but now he has been forced to flee from his island home into the Monastery of Kells because Viking raiders are coming, pillaging and looting everything in their way. In that monastery he meets young Brendan, an apprentice illustrator, who he sends into the surrounding forest to look for materials to make ink. In there Brendan meets many wonders and horrors, among them a female forest spirit named Aisling.This film is balm for the soul of anyone who has ever appreciated traditional hand-drawn animation. Everything from character designs to movement to rhythm works absolutely wonderfully, and at times you quite honestly miss what the characters are saying because you're so busy staring.Unfortunately, where the film falters a little bit is the story. It starts out very well, and is given more depth with the exploration of Brendan's two father figures. The strict abbot of the monastery, his uncle Cellach, and the more free-spirited and relaxed Aidan, who allows Brendan to explore his true passion. But after the second act the film simply seems to give up and the final third act is barely ten minutes long. It's like they ran out of budget and had to cram half an hour's worth of story into ten minutes. It doesn't rhyme at all and quite frankly ruins a perfectly good film. Now, it is possible that the choice was intentional in order to achieve a more mythological, legendary tone for the story, but in an animated film made in the 21st century it nevertheless seems extremely jarring.But, if you're going to see this film, see it for the visuals. The story is good enough to keep you interested, but it's the visuals that will probably bring you back if you're going to see it a second time."
69,The Secret of Kells,7,28 September 2015,Secret of Kells,"Liked:Animation, and dialogue are great to me. I truly loved the Dark Ones cave.All of the Aisling scenes.My Fave Quotes: 'I've seen suffering in the darkness. Yet I have seen beauty thrive in the most fragile of places.'Disliked:Bredan's later scenes, finishing the book, felt as if the events leading to his escape from Kells didn't matter so much to him as finishing the book did. The time skip. I would have liked to see a more developed storyline rather than a quick ending. Where did Aisling go?"
70,The Secret of Kells,6,13 May 2015,"Visually stunning, story needs work","This film looks great. Simple character design is set on a backdrop of incredibly elaborate beauty. There are some marvelous set pieces, as when magic infuses a cat. It's gorgeous, with a lovely, lilting score.The story, on the other hand, is a bit of a mess.The protagonist, Brendan, lives in a monastery, and the film is inspired by The Book of Kells, an elaborately illustrated book of the gospels. Oddly, the movie never actually tells you that, it simply states that this book can bring light to darkness yada-yada-yada. While inspired by a Christian text, the movie also has a pre-Christian forest fairy and monster. There are two ways to look at this. You can not look up Kells in wikipedia and it's a fairy tale of sorts involving a book whose power seems to lie in its gorgeous illustrations.Of you can know what the book is, and see it as a hodge podge of pagan and Christian religions.But either way, I can't think of a way to look at the movie that makes sense to me. If it's a fairy tale, then the book needs something more than to be a pretty thing with glowing illustrations. If it's a Christian thing, it should bring out the way that paganism and Christianity intertwine in the story. Ultimately, it has the elements of a folk tale but those elements, which include a stern uncle obsessed with protection, a kindly old man, a cat, a fairy, a monster, a magical crystal, and more, feel not like connected pieces but a rather random stew.I don't know if there is a good way to connect these elements; I feel the problem is in the premise. Still, it's very pretty."
71,The Secret of Kells,8,6 January 2014,Illuminating,"(Highly Recommended) The Secret of Kells was so secret that it may have been easily overlooked by many serious film-goers in 2009. With its poor distribution rights in the United States and lack of access to many theaters, this foreign-made independent film was hardly seen, but it is now available on DVD/BluRay and streaming on Netflix. (Against the odds, the film was surprisingly nominated for an Oscar that year for Best Animated Feature, losing to Up.) This is must-see viewing.The animated film tells the story of Brendan, a young boy living in an abbey during the 8th century. His stern and over-protective uncle, Abbot Cellach, forbids him to leave the monastery and venture out into the dangerous world. But Brendan has a calling, a need to complete an unfinished illustrated manuscript, the Book of Iona. So off he goes into a magical forest to collect to collect gall nuts to make special ink for new pages. With the help of a forest spirit, he overcomes many obstacles to finally reach his goal.The narrative itself is convoluted and in need of more concise storytelling with many transitions between scenes seemingly abrupt and too episodic. But the visual artistry on display is stunning. Directed by Tomm Moore, The Secret of Kells pays full homage to its source. (The Book of Kells is a Latin illuminated book based on the four Gospels of the New Testament that was created by monks during Medieval times. The actual book remains on display at Trinity College in Dublin.) The animators use the hand-drawn decorative motifs combined with traditional Christian iconography and create an imaginative and highly stylized work of art. The backgrounds are flat fields of color with vibrant patterns of ornate swirls and geometric Celtic designs. The film is remarkable in its visual beauty. With painstaking details, many of the film's images resemble the illuminated manuscript in comparison. Far from the average animated film from major studios, The Secret of Kells is demand viewing for any serious animation aficionadoVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
72,The Secret of Kells,10,16 July 2012,One of the best animated movies ever made in Europe,"I had gotten curious when I heard about this film. So I had ordered it online and after I had watched it...I loved it! To me, it was an eye-popping experience.This film is fictional account of the creation of the Book of Kells, an illuminated Latin manuscript containing the four Gospels of the New Testament. The book is famous for its elaborate illuminations depicting both Celtic knotwork and Christian imagery. The film's young hero Branden is taken under the tutelage of Brother Aidan, a celebrated master illuminator to help complete the precious book before Viking raiders attack the Abbey of Kells. Branden also receives help from a young fairy girl name Aisling.So that is all I could tell you folks, and overall Kells is one of the best animated movies ever made in Europe with plenty of fantasy, adventure, humor and beautiful animation. Also I do love the little cat Pangur Bán, she (or he) is cute!"
73,The Secret of Kells,,3 August 2011,Eh,"I watched this movie with my 11 year old daughter and then asked her what she thought of it. These were her exact words. ""Hmmmm i'm not sure what the director is trying to say to me or you or anyone but i hope it becomes clear"" My first thought was shes been reading to much Harry Potter (awesome movie by the way!). Then she pointed out some important points. There's a lot of untied ends that they never wrapped up. How did they know the vikings were coming,Why are they letting of Jim,Dick,and harry through the gate when it could be a viking. The HUGE aspect of the whole enchanted forest and wolf girl with the hair that would make a stylist swoon. Ain't it just a cowinkidink that there just happened to be another eye crystal right there in that very forest. The ending made me want to scream. EHHH EHH EHHH SPOILER SPOILER EHHH EHHH EHHH. He grows up brings the book back and the abbot is all hunky dorey. There had better be a second one. I liked the animation you know getting back to the basics. My favorite scene was when Ashley sang that song to make pangerbon do that weird ghost cat thing.Also when shes lifting up the totem statue for the boy to get in she said find the thing that turns darkness into light. When she said light her face got all old and scary.????I don't know bout you but thats something IIII would be somewhat curious about. Also Ashley said she was born and her mom and dad were killed by vikings. Two questions. Since when were spirits born and how on friggen earth do you kill them? After going over this with my daughter who is watching me right now (No i will not put in that you think the boy was cute he was ANIMATED) I decided that a 6 star rating be good enough. And i still haven't found out what the secret was but i ask you you to keep me posted. <("")"
74,The Secret of Kells,8,17 March 2016,Happy St Patricks Everyone!,"So I finally got to sit down and watch this film properly. You really would be jaw dropping the whole time because the animation was absolutely stunning, especially if it is a 2-D cartoon movie! The voice acting was good too, I honestly didn't know which character was voiced by Brendan Gleeson, all the men actors really sounded pretty much the same so I didn't know who was who!Even though I have heard a lot about the Book of Kells that's displayed in Trinity College Dublin, I just think the films crew weren't paying enough attention to much of what the book was actually about. The reason I just said that was because, there was no such thing as a young boy Brendan finding the book. Sure, no one knows who was the culprit that created the book! Apart from my little complaint, I thought everything was perfect. It does tell you a bit of history such as when the Vikings came to Europe and pretty much the detail of the books designs! Good all ages movie!Happy St Paddys Day Lads and Lassies! :D"
