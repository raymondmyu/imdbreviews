These good birds know nothing of the outside world. They treasure eggs above all else, and are all carefree and easygoing, except for few. One of these birds is Red, a societal outcast who has had anger issues from the very beginning. Eventually, his outbursts become too much and he is sentenced to anger management courses, where he meets other misfit birds with similar problems.The birds are suddenly visited by green pigs, who are dumb but funny. The birds and pigs quickly befriend each other, but Red does not trust the pigs at all. Ultimately, the pigs reveal their true colors, and leads to Red leading the entire flock in a ""maddening"" frenzy of rightful revenge as well as finding the right means of dealing with rage.Everything about this movie is impressive . I can guarantee you this great movie will make you happy."
1,The Angry Birds Movie,10,22 May 2016,These angry birds will make you happy.,"I can not believe how happy I became after watching this excellent movie. Honestly speaking watching movies for children is a thing I rarely do. But after watching the amazing trailer I made up my mind I must see it .Angry Birds is a very funny movie. We all need to laugh in these hard days because laughter makes our immunity high whereas sadness make our immunity weak .The story of angry birds is about flightless birds who are happily living except for one who is called Red . Poor bird he can't get over the daily problems that he has been facing in life. His angry temper made him attend management class, where he meets birds who have been suffering of disenchantment in life just like him (Chuck) and Bomb. Red becomes outraged when his other fellow birds welcome green pigs to their island paradise. As the swine begins to irritate him, angry bird Red teams with his other angry birds Chuck and Bomb to investigate the real reason behind the sudden occupation of the pigs.You will enjoy an excellent movie with superior comedy, entertaining adventure and amazing 3 D from the beginning of this movie till the end.This film is currently Number 1 in most countries and in the USA it went straight in at number 1 ( A proof this movie is successful and great)."
2,The Angry Birds Movie,10,25 May 2016,All My Girlfriends Loved This Great Movie.,"Angry Birds is a great movie for both children and adults. The comedy is simply mesmerizing and the adventure is extremely entertaining.On an island paradise populated almost entirely by happy, flightless birds, Red (Jason Sudeikis), a bird with a temper problem, speedy Chuck (Josh Gad), and the volatile Bomb (Danny McBride) have always been outsiders.But when the island is visited by mysterious green piggies who steal their eggs and carry them off to Piggy Island, it's up to these unlikely outcasts to save the day and show the pigs, including spokesman Leonard (Bill Hader), just how angry they can be.Truly all my girlfriends in the cinema were laughing and having good times including me during this Excellent movie."
3,The Angry Birds Movie,10,22 May 2016,"Angry Birds - Birds, Birds. I Know Birds Are The Word","Just over 2 years ago, I had never heard of 'Angry Birds'. Being 47, it's not surprising, however, my girlfriend(who I met that long ago) was and still is a huge fan of theirs. So, late yesterday afternoon we went to see it and she loved it. I can also say the same that I really liked it too. (Loved? Most likely.)An easy thing of just about anyone to understand, 'Red' is a bird with serious pent up anger issues, that pretty much fly out of his mouth when he just can't stand something that's getting on his nerves. An unfortunate result of bullying in school when he was younger. Which many people of many ages can relate to as well. His rage at a father who berates him for being late to his kid's birthday (as the clown), sends him over the edge and he winds up in anger management class. Where he meets his future friends. Meanwhile, a boatful of pigs from a neighboring island have come sailing in and extending the hand of friendship (Or are they?).Showering the birds of the island with gifts, parties and entertainment, the pigs are secretly 'hatching' a plan to make off with all the birds' eggs and have one huge egg banquet. 'Red' (whose house they squashed on arrival) is naturally suspicious of them, tries to warn everyone, but they wont listen.Anyhow, I'll stop the plot there as I don't want to give too much away, but what I'll tell you from here is, this movie is really worth seeing. I think parents can leave it up to their own best judgement of the appropriate age to attend. The film moves at an excellent pace, the animation is great, the story is timeless and there's very little to offend anyone over age 10 here. A great lesson learned in the film is, it's okay to feel angry, but it's important to learn and know, when to let it out and for what important reasons10 Stars , no doubt about it. (END_"
4,The Angry Birds Movie,8,23 May 2016,I really liked this film,"Yesterday myself,mom and my younger brother(who was dying to see this film in a long time)went to see this in 3D in the cinemas and we all enjoyed it.The film is based on the games app Angry Birds and is the first animated directional debut for Clay Kaytis(who was a supervisor animator for Disney and you may know him for Tangled,Wreck It Ralph,Frozen and Big Hero 6 to name a few)and Fergus O Reilly(an Irish director)and tells the tale of a bird called Red voiced by Jason Sudekis who has an anger problem and is sent to anger management as he ruined a baby bird's birthday party and Red loses his cool with the child's father. From there Red(who is a total recluse and a bad reputation for being stubborn) meets 3 more birds a grumpy bird who just moans voiced by Sean Penn called Terrence,a wisecracking hyperactive yellow bird called Chuck voiced by Josh Gad and a bird called Bomb who blows up and together they team up together as a mysterious pig and his crew are trying to steal the angry birds eggs. So will Red save the day and be known as a hero like his idol Mighty Eagle(voiced by Peter Dinklidge)?The animation is brilliant and the voice acting is very good. The 3D is very good I really enjoyed it and the story was very good. Now if I had to pick one nitpick I would say Josh Gad. Now he was hilarious as Chuck don't get me wrong he had me laughing out loud but every time I would hear his voice all I could think of was Olaf from Frozen since Josh was the voice of the snowman in Frozen.Overall though I liked it since Animation is my favourite genre of all time. Yes folks I am a 25 year old woman with no children and I love animated movies so what.I am giving this an 8/10 and a B rating."
5,The Angry Birds Movie,10,21 May 2016,Kids movie that all the family will love,"Very well-made movie, with great characters and a strong message. My sons LOVED it- they want to go see it again in the theater next week!I'm gonna buy the Blu-ray for sure - there aren't many kids' movies as good as this. Animation was of a very high quality, the music was catchy as hell and the voice acting superb. I wasn't expecting a movie based on the angry birds game to be any good, but I was totally blown away, so far this year it could be the best movie I've seen, period. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say there are a lot of unexpected twists and you root for the hero all of the way."
6,The Angry Birds Movie,9,31 May 2016,This movie made me feel understood,"Really enjoyed this movie. One of the few animated ones that I actually liked. It's different in a way, but I can't pinpoint what specifically I liked about it. The overall feel was just right and I guess I connected with Red (the main bird character).An invasion of pigs disturbing the peace of a good-natured bird- people, and with an evil intent to abuse the hospitality which they were offered so dearly. And the inevitable backlash when the peaceful birds rediscover their angry side and decide to retake what is theirs.Being a young man from Germany, maybe the theme resonated with me. I couldn't help but draw some parallels to the political situation in my country. Maybe I'm interpreting too much here, but the movie is still worth a watch. It definitely had some funny scenes which have made me laugh for minutes straight. The characters were made with love and I'm sure there's at least one that you will really like!"
7,The Angry Birds Movie,8,5 June 2016,Glad it turned out to be a movie!,"I remember playing Angry Birds when i was in my early teens and I played it for hours! It was so addicting. I even thought it was funny because you were playing as little birds whose eggs were stolen by green pigs and you have to destroy them with a big slingshot. It such a fun time playing the game like seriously, if you haven't played it yet, you should!Anyways let's talk about the movie, I thought the CGI and music in this were brilliant. I even liked the fact, it gave ya that ""summery"" feeling because the movie looked like it was during the summertime and this was shown last month. I really liked the casting in this, I absolutely fell in love with Red on this. Jason Sudeikis made him more likable and realistic because Red doesn't take any crap. He'll be known as Red for now on!Even though I really liked the movie, I just thought it was too predictable in some scenes and pointless characters like the mime guy or the hugging guy were in this. They shouldn't have been on it cause they really were a waste of Space....Apart from the complaints, I enjoyed the movie and I cannot wait for the sequel in a few years time whenever!"
8,The Angry Birds Movie,9,16 May 2016,Awesome !,"So, I'm almost 30 yo. Not the appropriate age to watch Angry Birds, right? Well, I did it anyway. Great decision ! I'm not that crazy about animation movies. I really enjoyed Zootopia, I laughed at Kung-Fu Panda, I would maybe watch Ice Age again, but I'd rather watch a decent thriller, than a really good cartoon. I went into the cinema not knowing what to expect, the trailer was funny and appealing, but after all, it's a movie made after a silly game (oh yeah, I'm not crazy about the game, either). Then, it started. I enjoyed every single part of it. Literally. I wouldn't change a thing about it. I mean, yeah, the story could be a bit more complex, but it's a video game. You can't make a LOTR-like story based on a game with exploding birds. I just loved the characters, every single one of them being funny as hell. The jokes were brilliant. I had to force myself to stop laughing at one point, because my stomach was aching. I still had a smile on my face 2 hours after the movie ended. I never thought I could enjoy a cartoon so much. I could watch it all over again today, and not regret a single moment. This might just be the best cartoon I ever saw."
9,The Angry Birds Movie,8,25 May 2016,"You'll be surprised, I was. Better than expected.","I honestly watched this with probably some of the lowest expectations. Wow, was I ever surprised! How could a movie about 'Angry Birds', a simple smart phone app game, be any good? Heck, Hollywood can barely make a decent video game movie, even one with an already great story. But, Angry Birds? A game with a few cut scenes and a simple story ""Pigs steal eggs, Birds try to get them back"". Well my hat is off to the writers and the actors. Enough gushing.Angry Birds does what a lot of great animated movies do. Write a funny story that kids can follow along. But also include enough 'inside jokes' for the adults to get, so that they can laugh too. I'm 46 and a father of a teen. We both laughed a lot during it, but I honestly think me and my 8yr old nephew enjoyed more than my 15yr old daughter.The voice acting is perfect. Jason and Josh do great job. But honestly I think Josh steals the movie. Josh/Chuck has some of the greatest scenes and lines. And he pulls them off even better than he did as Olaf in Frozen.NOT A SPOILER, shown in trailer. For the fans of the game, about half way through movie, you finally get your nod. When the birds attack the pigs, we finally get a taste of the game. But it doesn't take away from the movie as one might expect. They did a great job of sling shooting the birds at the pig's buildings without taking away from the story.I give it a 8 out of 10, great movie for the whole family. I didn't give it a 9 or 10, because though it is probably the best movie it could of been. It is a movie that probably could of been even better if it had nothing to do about a game. So that they didn't have to include certain things. But it is still a must see if you have kids or have ever played the game!"
10,The Angry Birds Movie,8,25 May 2016,Angry but still cute,"Best movie for kids playing angry bird. Don't waste time thinking that if that it isn't worth it for wasting time and money. Believe me it is great! Great story and really funny! And forget about the old saying that don't fight with the pig, you will get dirty and moreover the pig likes it. Best animated film! Angry but still cute! And most of us had played angry bird once in our life. Pigs are cute and cunning but will the birds over smart them. #angry is good !!!! Could be the best film of the year. Can't wait for angry bird being smashed in the wall. It's got great voices for the birds. Life of bird is good. Don't get it, watch the film to know about it. Angry birds look great with hand and legs. Watch the film and rate it today."
11,The Angry Birds Movie,10,15 May 2016,Lots of fun( for me AND KIDS),"It's been about twenty years or some since I've been to animated movie (MULAN,very nice indeed:)) But Angry Birds- movie just swept me away;, fun, detailed, humorous (+++), likeble, and even details for an adult, which children can understand, but in different way, you know.;) Water was incredible!!! And the attitude! ; nice change for all this pretty, love and easy- loving- main character. I did love the main character, because of his coming out of a box, being himself and Terence...please can I hear your response...:)...especially (Sean Penn).:) 3D was good work, anticipating for a sequel.. I hope people will find this great movie, which is not all about man and woman getting together somehow, like almost every movie is all about: to get homo sapiens male and female in the business, you know... Everyone can relate to this!"
12,The Angry Birds Movie,10,20 May 2016,Why y'all gotta be dissing on Dixieland?,"I think it's great! It's got several sync oh pay shuns.It's based on the cheapo video game app that rose out Finland's Rovio Entertainment in 2009 to lock kids of all ages to their smartphones in rapt revenge mode. The Angry Birds Movie is both a big-screen, 3D attempt to cash in on a huge mobile app phenom and a funny ha-ha excuse to party down at the multiplex. The movie is not interactive. There's no touchscreen or digital slingshot that lets you hurl angry, wingless birds at the green pigs who've stolen their eggs. But vengeance is still part of the deal. First-time directors Clay Katis and Fergal Reilly give this animated joyride an eye-popping visual palette and an all-star cast of voice actors to bring this origin story to life."
13,The Angry Birds Movie,8,22 May 2016,Not a bad movie but not for your 4-5 years old,"You know what? I went with my kids thinking I will get bored because the movie was rated around 6/10. I actually had more fun than the kids.I've watched the movie in 2D. The characters are rather 'mature' and some dialogues will appeal more to adults than to kids. It is not a 'childish' movie.The battle scene is wayyy noisy, long (it lasts about 20 minutes) and overwhelming, I noticed several young kids in the theater lost patience and quit standing seat and were getting agitated.Other than that, the birds are nice looking. I had no idea what this movie will be about as I'm not a big game player, but the story kinda keeps up well enough and the movie is 'dynamic' at most moments."
14,The Angry Birds Movie,9,14 May 2016,"Funny, colorful and brisk movie.","The Angry Birds Movie is funny, colorful and brisk movie. Somebody has said, that movie is three years late, but I don't think so. It brings nostalgic feeling back from games and make them desirable again. Story line is simple, but it meanders nicely. Movie is full with funny wordplay, even so much, that it is sometimes almost hard to follow all of them and this is promising for the movie. You want to see it again to find all those puns. Movies scenery is beautiful and colorful and all the action will satisfy younger audience. Funny wordplay confidently satisfy more adult audience. Familiar pop songs brings some nice nostalgic feeling for movie. The story could be bit little more profound, but to me movie is basic entertainment and nicely airy. There are many references to other movie and that satisfy movie goers like me. Animation is beautiful and colorful. 3D brings nice depth to scenery and works nicely enough to counsel to see it in 3D.In Finland we have also dubbed version of the movie, but that didn't persuade me to test. Maybe when BluRay version comes out I can try how they have dubbed those wordplay. The story is underlay quite long, but when they finally get's to action it feels familiarity with Angry Birds games. Rarely comes out a good movie out of game, but The Angry Birds Movie turns nicely to a movie. It is shameless entertaining, but it almost make me start to play all those old games again. Good family entertainment."
15,The Angry Birds Movie,10,13 May 2016,Angry birds is a must see ! This movie will solve all your anger issues,"I loved the movie . I have never played the game . The story line was fast page and engaging . The animation was excellent . This is a kids movie , however it reaches out To all ages . I saw 3 year old kids and Grandparents in the audience laughing at the same jokes . Even thou it was based on app that had billion downloads The story stands on it own . It has important lessons through out . However nothing that was over the top . Reds character certainly Teaches us lessons On anger , what happens when we loose control, Why it's import to mange our anger . Of course you will see yourself in one The characters , I have decided I am chuck and sometimes bomb. Enjoy ;)"
16,The Angry Birds Movie,9,12 May 2016,Great movie equally for adults as to children,"I can honestly say I walked into the movie theatre expecting the worst. Long story short I was wrong! (1) The story-line was really interesting and was equivalent to the game itself. (2) As we all know it's a movie mostly directed to a younger audience to send a positive message : Be Happy! But what made me love this movie is the fact that there were these jokes (inappropriate to younger viewers) made for the parents or older brothers and sisters etc. which really cracked me up, for example : Red : ""Pluck my life"" or Might Eagle playing - Never Gonna give you up by Rick Astley. Many people dislike overused 'memes' but this movie did it just right ... another reason to love this movie. Finally the movie came together really well in story-line , animation and humor! I enjoyed it and so did my 3 younger sisters. I give this movie a solid 9/10"
17,The Angry Birds Movie,8,14 May 2016,Watch the birdy!,"I recently saw the film with my wife and two children (7 and 9) and we all really enjoyed it. The story has enough visual gags and toilet humour to keep most children amused (as well as a few adults too) and uses it's gaming app heritage to good effect within the very simple story line. All the Angry Bird characters make an appearance but with the focus on Red, Chuck and Bomb.The quality of the animation is excellent and complimented to good effect with the actors voices, making it both fun to watch and listen to. Some of the slapstick humour reminded me of the old Looney tunes cartoons, particularly when the birds are propelled into battle against the pigs, while many of the visual jokes in the background are so quick and subtle, blink and you'll miss them.If you and your kids liked the movie Surfs up, then you will probably like this one, however you may see similarities in some of the characters - Mighty Eagle is just a variation on the Big Z character from Surfs up.A film based on a gaming app isn't going to be deep and meaningful but if you just want feel-good family entertainment and a good laugh, then you won't go far wrong with The Angry Birds Movie."
18,The Angry Birds Movie,7,5 June 2016,"Surprisingly very entertaining, much better than it had a right to be","Having never played the app/game, it was going to be interesting to see whether 'The Angry Birds Movie' was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed.'The Angry Birds Movie' is not perfect, but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it. There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year (i.e. 'Zootropolis' aka 'Zootopia' in some places), but also far worse on both counts. From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema, 'The Angry Birds Movie' is the superior film of the two. The other was 'Ratchet & Clank', which is not as bad as critics made out (personal opinion of course) and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations' dubious track record, but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film.Getting the flaws out of the way, the story in 'The Angry Birds Movie' is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don't really go anywhere. It does occasionally feel rushed too, and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire. This is especially true with the quite tasteless, awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag, that was also really quite out of place.However, the animation in 'The Angry Birds Movie' is great. The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant, the characters are well-modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds. There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences. The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over-bearing, and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve.While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly, the script has some very funny moments, is tonally balanced with very little that's inappropriate or distasteful, is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines. The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling, the message is a great one, gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over-sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film.'The Angry Birds Movie's colourful characters carry the film beautifully, with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun. The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting. The voice acting, including actors who you wouldn't expect to work as well as they did in voice acting, is excellent, with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage.All in all, surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
19,The Angry Birds Movie,,27 May 2016,Funny and touching,"This film tells the story of an outcast bird in the bird community, because of his anger problems and because of his thick eyebrows. He saves the day when he recognises that pig visitors may have sinister intentions then they declare.Yes I enjoyed played Angry Birds before, but when they announced an Angry Birds movie I thought it was rather silly. I thought there would be inadequate plot to fill up the screen time. Hence, I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the trailer. It actually made me want to watch the film! The film has a simple plot, that is basically given away in the trailer. Well, you might just be able to figure it out even not having watched the trailer. Nevertheless, it is a funny film with lots of laughs. I find the urination scene a bit tasteless and far too lengthy, but each to their taste. The ending is quite touching. I enjoyed watching it overall."
20,The Angry Birds Movie,10,8 May 2016,Thank You Angry Birds,"Dear Angry Birds, Thank you for the fantastic movie. Me love the movie so much I buy all you're games and toys because your birds are angry and funny.The animation in the movie was superb. Everything looked like the game but more real and better. My favorite bird is the red bird because he's the main one, but I also like Yellow and Fatso. All the characters were funny and good development. I laughed at all the jokes and so did my dad sometimes. Please make more, it was sooooooooooo good. I almost had a heart attack watching my favorite characters come to life on the big screen. So big and come to life! Great movie.From Bird"
21,The Angry Birds Movie,10,21 May 2016,Finally a kids movie with a healthy message,"It's been a long time since a movie didn't make my kids curious and ask serious questions.Don't be fooled by the childish look of the movie, the situation in which the birds are is problematic and unheard of in the game.In short, you identify easily to Red, rightfully angered in a crowd of apathetic birds, but using his anger to fix things, angry-birds-style.The movie kindly makes fun of today's hip culture which leads teens to follow all those narrow-minded so-called ""e-celebrities"", and become adults with no character, no personality and no good role models except reality-TV empty shells.The movie does a great job at transcribing our current world in the game universe. You'll notice some winks that you kids won't notice, but nothing that only an adult should understand, if you get what I mean.I am very pleased to have brought my kids to a long-awaited movie with good morals, instead of the mainstream ""don't listen to your parents"" or ""marry the first cool guy you see"" narrative."
22,The Angry Birds Movie,9,21 May 2016,An amazing movie!,"I went to see this movie with my son today and i surprisingly had a good time! The cinematics are good, humour was quite on point and it had a great moral in the movie.Some might argue that the movie came a little bit too late, but i tend to disagree. My son remembered the main characters and was happy to see them.It's important to teach our kids that we not only have to stand up for ourselves, but also for others. A moral you don't get to see a lot these days.Take your family or friends to the movie and have a blast!"
23,The Angry Birds Movie,9,25 May 2016,Great Family FIlm,"Amazing FILM! teaches many great lessons fun for all the family.teaches the importance of channeling your anger and the importance of nationalismI will buy this once it comes out.I loved the character of Red, he is a vert realistic character. He will act as a good role model for kids, much better than the Zoophilia beastiality nonsense.It also teaches healthy gender roles and has great animation.I'm looking forward to more by this studio.King Mudbeard was a frightening villain as well."
24,The Angry Birds Movie,,17 May 2016,A laugh out loud kind of film,"I absolutely loved this family friendly cartoon because it made me laugh out loud! The animation in this movie is exquisite. It is so detailed that you can clearly see all the feathers on the birds and tiny waves of the ocean. When they show scenes of the town you can see the patch work on the houses and the real looking scenery. Each character is unique because the creative animation matches their personalities. This movie is about, Red (Jason Sudeikis), a red bird who never fit in and has anger issues. One day, he has to go to an anger management class and meets the birds Bomb, Matilda, Chuck and Terence, and they all become friends.Then, pigs come to the island on an unexpected visit. They have parties with the birds and they give the birds weird gifts like trampolines and motorcycles and generally cause havoc in the town. A horrible turn of events happens and Red and all of the other birds need to save the day. My favorite scene is when Red attends anger management class. Matilda, the instructor talks with all the birds about their issues. They participate in many funny exercises such as poetry writing and yoga. This is a funny scene. Red has the wrong attitude and is definitely negative and Matilda the instructor demonstrates some anger issues too. My favorite character is Terence (Sean Penn), a giant red and black bird who doesn't really talk as much as he grunts. His facial expressions are particularly funny. Terence gets a lot of laughs from the audience and appears to be a crowd favorite. The Angry Birds Movie is definitely a comedy. Almost every scene, even the sad ones, have funny lines. There is some humor that would make sense to older kids and adults but not little kids. There are some parts that some adults might not feel comfortable with some of the content. For example, when the pigs slap their butts and joke about reproducing.I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars because of the humor and recommend it for ages 4 to 18. It is a fun and silly animated movie about angry birds. Who doesn't love angry birds? If you like the game Angry Birds or just want to have a good laugh, then The Angry Birds Movie is the movie for you. It opens in theaters nationwide May 20, 2016 so, go check it out. Reviewed by Mia A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
25,The Angry Birds Movie,8,21 August 2016,Better than I had thought it would be,"The reasons I liked this show. and I am 43. My boys 13 and 9 loved it. 1) I think that most older kids and teens would like this because they would get more of the humor. This is not a show for under 8 years of age. And if you don't get it than either you don't have a sense of humor or enough life experience to think it's funny. 2) I think that this show appeals to people who get things that may on the surface seem just barely entertaining, but in fact reveal something a bit deeper. Reviewers who have said there's no story line were obviously not paying attention. 3) It's not a Disney type cartoon. 4) It reminded me of all the slap stick cartoons I loved as a kid but loved even more as a grownup. Think Bugs Bunny. 5) There are some references you just wouldn't get or laugh at if you hadn't been previously exposed and scarred for life. Two word clue ""Jack Nicholson"". Let the scavenger hunt begin."
26,The Angry Birds Movie,9,17 August 2016,Comedy film with an adventurous story,"Angry birds is a must watch movie. Filled with laughter and of course ANGRY BIRDS. A new story with Red,Fast,Bomb and others. Exciting adventurous Story line. Good direction and background effects.good story line where it is a massive work by the director. in the story first all angry birds meet at the mind cooling classes and share their experiences with each other.after this bad piggies come in , they show that they will do no harm , but secretly they stole all the eggs of the birds and flew to their land. and from here the adventure to take the eggs back start . one of the best animated movie of this year. 9/10 because it doesn't have a nice song"
27,The Angry Birds Movie,7,15 August 2016,"Rich in color, energy and perfectly dreadful puns, this film adaptation of the Finnish gaming phenomenon surpasses all cynical expectations.","Agreeability gets you so far in life, but when the chips are down, it helps to lose your temper sometimes. That's a pretty unexpected moral takeaway for a kids' movie, and it's just one surprise of many in ""The Angry Birds Movie,"" a fast, fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise that, at its zenith, had children of all ages glued to their smartphone screens. Establishing a basic psychological motivation for the fiery disposition shared by the feathered folk of Bird Island, this irreverent origin story takes an appropriately loose, elastic approach to its larger narrative, with frequent detours to fill in daffier details of its mad, mad, mad, mad story world."
28,The Angry Birds Movie,10,14 August 2016,Great movie,I love the movie it has funny moments they do some older children humor so little kids and older kids will like it and he says shut the buck up several times it's really funny and I love how red is mean in the beginning and when bomb blows up at the surprise party its really really really funny (sorry can't think of a lot more to say so I'm using up room) I lie how Mighty eagle didn't help them and then he said he did and when red saved the eggs mighty eagle got all the credit i also heard red say don't they have bird control and Chuck says ladies lets get busy tonight when the eggs get stolen over all this movie is really funny and yes they do say some things that some people may find bad I don't it's good for families and adults and children will like it and who doesn't like the angry birds game and they still use the sling shot and there's a back ground on why the birds hate the pigs and it will make you want to play the game.
29,The Angry Birds Movie,7,21 May 2016,Not What I Expected,"I think that because my expectations were so low going in, I ended up really enjoying this movie. The promotional footage and images with the bright colors and goofy character designs made me think that this movie was being targeted for really little kids, but DON'T BE FOOLED. This is definitely aimed for the 10 and older demographic, as evidenced by all the pee jokes and innuendos. That being said, I was delightfully surprised by the clever humor, beautiful animation, and insanely fun climax. I must say, though, that this movie's greatest achievement is having one of the best voice casts I've ever seen. Jason Sudeikis is a strong center to the film, and his deadpan delivery makes me upset that he is no longer attached to that Fletch reboot. Bill Hader creates a Gregory Peck, George C. Scott-like persona as the villainous Leonard. Peter Dinklage almost steals the show as the a flawed icon of the birds. There's also some great work being done by the likes of Maya Rudolph, Kate McKinnon, Keegan Michael-Key, and, of all people, Sean Penn, and it's fun to hear some great TV actors like Tony Hale, Danielle Brooks, Ike Barinholtz and Tituss Burgess in smaller roles. The highlights, though, are Josh Gad and Danny McBride, who help create two of the most memorable sidekicks in modern film animation. While watching this movie, I kept comparing it to Zootopia. While Zootopia had a much more original premise and all-around creativity, Angry Birds was stronger in terms of humor and all-around enjoyment, which I think comes from the simplicity of the story and characters."
30,The Angry Birds Movie,7,22 May 2016,Silly and Derivative but Charming and Humor-Filled,"Following along in similar footsteps as The Lego Movie, The Angry Birds Movie manages to create a fun and thrilling feature length story out of something that didn't have any reason being a film in the first place. While it doesn't have an overly intelligent script with a great moral story, it's beautifully animated, full of action, and some timely humor for all ages.As with every animated film these days, bringing in world class voice talent is vitally important. People like Jason Sudeikis, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Josh Gad, and Peter Dinklage add some credibility to the film, but unsurprisingly, they are what sold the film to me with its comedic charm. I think that's what this film is at its core, charming. It won't stick with you with grand themes like Zootopia, or catchy songs like Frozen, but it certainly made me laugh, and that's all I was hoping for.With all of the well-timed adult humor, there was a good amount of unnecessary ""potty"" humor that felt more like the filmmakers were reaching for laughs. It's that type of desperate humor that overtakes the ridiculous joy out of seeing the birds angrily soar through the air from a slingshot toward pigs. And yes, to a certain extent you have to suspend your disbelief as to why birds simply can't fly in this film, but hey that's canon in the game.The central story of Red, voiced by Sudeikis, and his overcoming of his anger was very predictable and doesn't offer anything new with storytelling. In fact, his arc is overtly similar to that of Shrek in the 2001 film. But I did enjoy seeing the dynamic of Red, Chuck, and Bomb as they attempt to uncover what it is the pigs are up to. The script tends to veer off at times in the middle act, as the trio travels to find the 'Mighty Eagle', voiced by Dinklage, but it picks up for a pleasantly heartwarming final act.+Surprisingly charming+Voice talent+Great animated action-Silly humor reaches for laughs-Unfocused middle act7.3/10"

32,The Angry Birds Movie,8,17 May 2016,"In my opinion, a misunderstood great movie","I've seen this movie along with my nephews, I expect to be entertained... And what did I get, going out at the cinema all exited and wondering If there's going to be a sequel or shorts based of the movie! I mean, it is true that the plot seems rushed, but the characters dialogues and fun puns made the movie being safe to get a Razzie. The animation is amazing, they even did the reflection in the eyes of the characters according to the lights and scenery right! The main character, Red, shows clearly why he's angry: since he was a kid he hold deep inside all the anger and frustration, he is orphaned and never got any close friend. Not only because of this; I mean, no wonder he is so hostile! I would be annoyed if a guy would spread snouts over my popcorn. And no bird has even say to him ""sorry""; is it too much to ask to be polite and apologize?! Chuck and Bomb are just the perfect birds to be Red's friends! The fast bird it's just a little bolt of energy and comical relief that didn't hesitate to made jokes that, one or two, are innuendos that I'm glad the kids didn't understand it yet. Matilda and Terrence were amazing too. And the big guy it's someone who would remind me the silence guy who had a secret life of an assassin or ex CIA agent. Now the pigs... What can I say about them? Leonard really show to be the master of deceiving and making the birds look like fools, he would admit that many (as almost the rest of the crew) are just to much dumb to let them being by themselves... But wasn't he the dumb one who give the birds the slingshot at the first place? ;)Just before to think to not go to see it because of the bad reviews, just think that it's like the movies like ""Lego"" or ""Atlantis""; underrated and misunderstood."
33,The Angry Birds Movie,7,25 May 2016,WHO would have the Noble American Eagle . . .,". . . Living Symbol of the United States, urinating like some senile geezer into his constituents' Communal Water Supply?! Before this year, people might accuse the Japanese Government's Propaganda Arm--Sony Pictures--of going over-the-top with this scene from its current release, ANGRY BIRDS, in depicting such a hyperbolic outrage that not even a three-year-old would swallow it. But hundreds of American toddlers in Flint, MI, have been swallowing a lot worse than eagle urine for the past few months, so they feel right at home this week as they sit watching the Dirty Bird in Flint's Rave Theater on Corunna Road. After enriching himself as one of Michigan's ""business nerds"" who exported all of Flint's Middle Class jobs to Japan, Mighty Wolverine Rick plopped himself down in the Governor's Mansion, from which he appointed an ""Emergency Manager"" to kick his jobless people of Flint in their faces by switching the city's water supply from Pure Michigan Great Lakes nectar to industrial ditch sludge poisoned with lead and killer germs. Member's of Rick's Flint flock will continue to croak prematurely for decades to come, dismissed as just so many expendable ANGRY BIRDS."
34,The Angry Birds Movie,8,23 May 2016,A Return to The Golden Age of Animation,"Animation is a bigger industry then it has ever been in the past, shattering records and setting new standards, but a lot of them feel like live action films that have been dressed up in GCI clothing. It's a good step toward making animation a serious medium, but there was a time when animation had its own comedic style that just wouldn't work in live action.Enter the Angry Birds movie. Based on the popular smartphone game, Angry Birds hearkens back to the golden age of animation, especially the Road Runner cartoons. The action is energetic and the comedic delivery is always on time. There are also a lot of ""Blink and you'll miss them"" sight gags, as well as some subtle adult humor (which the golden age was also known for). There isn't one joke that feels out of place, and every character has some humorous quirk that works to the film's advantage (like Red being a cynical pessimist and Chuck being hyperactive). These characters are brought to life by an all-star cast who clearly took their roles very seriously, and it shows. My favorite is probably Peter Dinklage as the Mighty Eagle, who the movie portrays as an egotistical superhero-type character who is well past his prime.The animation itself is beautifully rendered, looking practically photo-realistic while still being exaggerated and cartoonish. The birds are more anthropomorphic than they were in the game, having arms and legs and living on a tropical island. The same can be said for the pigs, who have also been given more human-like features and personalities. The environments are more realistic than cartoonish, but they still have some exaggerated elements that complement the film's tone and characters.If you're looking for a dramatic and thought-provoking animated film, then you won't find it here (I recommend Zootopia in that case), but if you want to experience the wacky and energetic style that the golden age was known for, then I recommend the Angry Birds movie."
35,The Angry Birds Movie,8,3 June 2016,Video Game Turned Movie,"Did not play the video game or really do not have use for them but that's another story.It is the story of Red an outcast that just wants to be alone and has anger issues. And at times, with good reason. As he deep down wants friends but tries to hide a facade.After something happened, he is sent to anger management and ""befriends"" with Chuck a fast bird and Bomb that literally is named over sitting himself off.With some happy and flightless pigs going to the island, of where Red and his new friends live, and wants to be peacemakers. As the rest of the island accepts them except Red, who sees right through their ruse.Will the others on the island see the ruse, or will Red continue to be the outcast. The movie has more character development that you ever could see in a video game. Since I do not play them. But it is a good message as one added."
36,The Angry Birds Movie,8,2 June 2016,Great movie,"I think the movie was a great movie. It had a good plot and was the right length of time. There wasn't too many funny parts, like the rhyme if you add to much sugar it will become to sweet. I didn't give it a 10 because it wasn't my type of movie, but i know it will be lots of children s favorite movie for a long time. It is also a movie parents will enjoy. It is exactly like the game but turned into a story and plotPositivesBoth parents and children will enjoy it.Great plot Right amount of time Wasn't to many funny parts"
37,The Angry Birds Movie,7,29 May 2016,Funny and relatable,"I've never played or cared about Angry Birds before, but I still decided to try this movie. And I'm quite glad I did, for it is a lot better than I expected. It is silly and hilarious but it still has a decent plot, moral, and some emotion. The animation is very lively and colorful.The main character is a grumpy bird called Red whom I'm sure many people would find relatable. Life just doesn't treat him well and so he acts rather angry, leading others to believe he's a terrible bird when all he wants is some peace. The other characters besides Red are likable too and all have their own unique personalities.Most of the gags in the movie didn't make me laugh out loud, but that's okay because there was still plenty of comedy to enjoy and most of it made me laugh on the inside. There were many adult jokes but most of them weren't blatant enough to be much of a worry if there's a young kid watching. The gross-out humor was distasteful of course but there wasn't as much of it as I thought there'd be; I expected more fart jokes but thankfully there weren't. The puke joke was unappealing but luckily it was only a few seconds; the pee joke is what really bothered me because it was really awkward and lasted way too long.There are some heart-warming moments and character revelations throughout the movie, particularly near the end, but I shan't be specific to avoid spoilers. The movie mostly focuses on making viewers laugh but there are still other reasons to watch it, such as a nice moral about having faith in yourself and trusting yourself to do the right thing. Anyone who knows Angry Birds could have predicted the plot, and the moral's been done before, but it's still an enjoyable watch."
38,The Angry Birds Movie,8,21 May 2016,Pretty awesome!,"Watched this movie today. Trailer can mostly describe the first beginning parts. If you play the game you know that it's birds vs pigs. The plot is pretty predictable. Most of the time you can guess what's coming. The pigs invade and you can watch the movie to find what happened. Would I recommend it? Yes. It's definitely worth the money watching. Watched it with a group of friends and it was hilarious. 3 Dirty Jokes made the whole theater laugh. Ian Hecox and Anthony Padildo from Smosh starred in it. Couldn't tell it was them. Although the movie could have been shorter. Many scenes that weren't necessary wasted some time. My dad almost fell asleep because of how it was. It's not star wars long or anything. The movie is just the game, but heavily driven out with a huge plot and funny ass storyline. TL;DR Just watch it"
39,The Angry Birds Movie,8,15 May 2016,Kinda Unexpected,"This movie was unexpectedly good. I went into the cinema knowing nothing of it. I didn't even like the game. It was very nice to watch an animated movie, not made by Pixar. It was full of bird and pig jokes, (I watched it in Hungarian language) and it didn't become boring even at the end of the film. From a peaceful start it became action packed, but at the same time it became less interesting for me. There are a lot of reference to the open world, so you need a little knowledge about it. I agree with the PEGI-6 rating, it can be easily understood by anyone. I really liked the feature that I could unlock new levels on the game, with the end credits song. It was a nice touch!"
40,The Angry Birds Movie,9,3 June 2016,an amazing film!!!,when i first heard that they were making a movie out of the angry birds concept i expected it to be trash. But this surpassed my expectations by through its good script and humour.i congratulate the directors in making a good film out of a very small concept. the birds are really adorable and the whole thing is a pleasure to watch. the pigs are also better than i expected. the film has an amazing style. special mention for the voice-over for all the characters which were really apt for the character. this film reminds me why i keep watching animation. thank you for this adorable film.
41,The Angry Birds Movie,10,2 June 2016,So plucking better than the game!,"OK, first off, the idea of a movie from a game, sounded like a sure flop to me (hello, Mario Brothers!).But I must say, the story and the animation were awesome, and the anger, so real you wanna join in.There are many wisecracks, some Kleenex moments and just plenty of things shooting out of those birds' rears, so much to make it worth your time.If you have a wee person who could never put your phone down playing the game, this movie is sure to make that obsession shoot through the sky."
42,The Angry Birds Movie,9,30 May 2016,Fantastic game to movie transition,"When I heard that an ""Angry Birds"" movie was coming along, I couldn't help but feel that Rovio was yet again cashing in on their cash cow. What a wonder to - Angry Birds has everything from their original smartphone games to games on modern console to such tie ins as fruit snacks and merchandise at your local Walmart. However, when I walked out of the movie theater I saw an entirely different beast than I was expecting - the movie was actually good.When I walk into a computer animated film, I either expect something that portrays itself in a certain light or it is building itself off of the popularity of another film. In this case, I swear this film is similar to that of ""Toy Story"", but it is anything but - so I assume it is because it is a new franchise that will probably end up with multiple movies on its hands - I doubt this (being Rovio and all) will be just a one shot. The movie does not go out of its way to portray itself in a certain light though. Instead, it takes a few elements from the game and converts it seamlessly to the big screen where so many video game to movie conversions pay so miserably.All of the elements from the game that we are familiar with are present - all six birds make their appearance, the slingshot, piggies, eggs, as well as personalities that heavily resemble the characters - are also present. However, if it were just based on the gameplay it wouldn't be a very good movie. Instead we are treated to a movie that is very good in its own right, and then borrows from the game to further the plot along. Thankfully the plot works both in the game and in the movie.However, the movie absolutely shines with the individual characters' backgrounds. The main character ""Red"" has an anger management problem and is forced by court order (after a mishap) to see just that. His group sessions are part of a group called ""Angry Birds""; they all have reasons for being there. Most of their problems and why they are there is due to the fact of their personalities also present in the video game. Another character named ""Bomb"" randomly explodes at times; another is fast - really fast, and his anger drives him to do stupid things at the expense of others - the list goes on.The film changes gears several times over - the best part is probably how all of the characters seamlessly interact - and then constantly give throwbacks to the game. Even if you are not a casual player of the game series, this movie can stand on its own - which is a nice nod to movie goers. The movie has a few serious moments to it, but it is mostly good comedy. Yes their is a lot of comical violence in it, but it is all for effect - no blood is drawn and it stays true to its roots. I mean, like a title with ""Angry Birds"" what were you expecting?This movie strangely enough, is very popular with kids - I was not expecting so many children here at a weekend showing; but it also had a number of adults and higher numbers for a weekend show than I would also normally expect. This movie is one of the better ones that seem to be few and far between - almost a lost art of sorts - at the cinema. I recommend this movie to others; especially those that want to laugh.Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/? p=11389)."
43,The Angry Birds Movie,7,24 May 2016,Like A Story Book,"Ups: I watched this for my friends birthday, and I have to say I was surprised at how good it was. It was clever and relatively funny. They did push in a couple cursing jokes, like ""Mother Clucker"" and such. The animation was really good, and the funniest thing hidden in the background (Like a bank named 'Piggy Bank'). This is suitable for all ages and Maturity, so don't think it is 'just a kids' film'. This was really funny and I was rolling around in my chair in the cinema over how funny they were. Downs: The things that I didn't really like was how they rushed it all. They had Red being in court, then the pigs arrive, steal the eggs and then forgive Red and makes him their leader. Another thing they forgot was a catchy story line. Overall a good movie. I do recommend. 7.4/10"
44,The Angry Birds Movie,7,23 May 2016,Pretty funny!!,"So I never played the game before. I should have done that before I saw it, but the movie actually gave me a pretty good run through on how to play the game as well as tips on how to get far in the game and how to use all the birds in the game, so that's cool. They did a better job at it than the movies Battleship and Doom.Loved all the voice talent in the movie lead by Jason Sudeikis who plays the Red bird, with a hot temper whose force into anger management were he forms relationships with other angry birds, Chuck, played by Josh Gad, Bomb, played by Danny McBride, and Terrance who was played brilliantly by Sean Penn. They are the only one's who can help Red when he realizes the friendly Pigs that invaded their Island are up to something. I loved the animation and the design of the characters. It's very funny and entertaining."
45,The Angry Birds Movie,8,20 May 2016,Slingshot of a movie,"So, the first mobile game to hit the biggest of screens and I walked in having low expectations but yes I was one of the one billion who downloaded the game back in 2009 and enjoyed it. But, really? Make a film about it? Maybe make a film about the people behind the game? But a film about flightless birds who go up against eggnapping pigs? 97mins of it at that too! Well, it worked and pretty much like the ridiculous premise for a game it was surprisingly enjoyable and entertaining. Boasting an all star cast including Jason Sudeikis as Red, comedy favourites, Josh Gad as speedy Chuck, Danny McBride as Bomb and Maya Rudolph as anger manager chicken (I think chicken) Matilda. Not forgetting Bill Hader and Peter Dinklage as the mighty eagle, oh, and a feather-ruffled growling Sean Penn as Terence. (Would love to have seen Penn's reaction to reading the script.) It was funny to notice the subtext on the age certificate warning at the beginning quoting ""Slapstick comedy and toilet humour."" As the film contained exactly that and pun after pun making it actually well scripted for what it is. Brings a whole new meaning to 'Golden Eagle'. The storyline is pretty basic but hey, all is forgiven if the film does what it says on the cover, right? What are viewers actually expecting from this kind of movie? It isn't the only debut either, being the first mobile game to hit the big screen but impressively it's also Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly's directorial debut but both having experience working on films like The Iron Giant, Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph and even Frozen. The two really put on a great show and even managed to get some slingshot action in there with great comedy effect, the toucan making a comeback! (Pun intended) And I have to mention the soundtrack. Amazing. Black Sabbath, KRS-One, Tone Loc and The Scorpions are just a few plus the best usage of Limp Bizkit's ""Behind Blue Eyes"" (I know I'm gonna listen to this later.) And what's with the Daft Punk!? Those guys are always getting on the big screen. Epic.It's great animation, beautifully colourful and laugh out loud funny. Cute, fluffy and had comedy for all the family. Plus I also advocate the ideal that sometimes, just sometimes a little bit of anger is required for the greater good. The biggest surprise of 2016 so far. The Finnish game developers must be flapping and snorting all the way to market. Running Time: 9 The Cast: 10 Performance: 7 Direction: 9 Story: 7 Script: 8 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for Chuck's parody of Marvel's Quicksilver. Touché. 83% 8/10"
46,The Angry Birds Movie,10,3 June 2016,Angry Birds deliver,"The Angry Birds Movie deliver one of the best animated comedies ever created for families. You and your family will love all of the laughs in this once in a life time experience that you will never forget trust me. It has a lot of heart that will make you feel good inside and never want to leave it.Parents this movie has no profanity but there are spots where you know where there should be profanity like what the cluck. The movie will make your kids super happy and the 3D glasses are sick in a good way. This is one of the best 3D movies I have ever seen the animation is wonderful. I hope that you enjoy this movie as much as I did because it is a hint of fresh air that you will love forever and ever it is truly magical rock on Blake Shelton, Demi Lovato"
47,The Angry Birds Movie,10,11 June 2016,Angry Bird Movie - 'Make America Great Again',"Took my grandchild to see the Angry Birds movie today and was so amazed to see the characters in the movie coincide so well with what is currently going on in America and the political elections of 2016. Go see this movie and see if you notice that the 'Birds' represent the American people who are so angry with the establishment politicians who are screwing up a Great America. The 'Pigs' in the movie represent the establishment politicians and the far left liberals and deadbeat living off the government who are determined to transform our great nation that we have worked so hard to build. These 'Pigs' put on a fake face and tell lies to try to convince the 'Birds' that they are here to take care of them and show them a great time, just like the establishment politicians are doing us. The 'Pigs' are really after stealing the 'eggs' which represent the Great America we have built. The Angry Bird named 'Red' represents Donald Trump who is the one Angry Bird who recognizes the 'Pigs' (establishment) for what they really are and is ultimately able to expose them. Of course, 'Red' takes a lot of push back and blame from all the birds who have fallen for the propaganda the Pigs are feeding them. Great Movie. Of course my grandchild picked up on none of this."
48,The Angry Birds Movie,9,27 May 2016,Thoroughly entertaining for kids & adults alike.,"The Angry Birds Movie is based on the smart phone game app, Angry Birds. Red(Jason Sudeikis) has been an outcast, his entire life. He lives on an island inhabited by joyous, flightless birds. However, Red is the exception. He is a bird, who is always in a bad mood. When some green pigs led by Leonard(Bill Hader), visit Bird Island, Red begins to suspect them & questions their motives. He takes the help of Chuck(Josh Gad) & Bomb(Danny McBride), to find out what the pigs are up to. The Angry Birds Movie is an extremely hilarious & entertaining film. Directors Clay Kaytis & Fergal Reilly stay faithful to the basic premise of the game, while also masterfully expanding on it. The makers of the film, give the iconic birds & pigs, a much needed origin story. Now we finally know, how it all began! Don't worry though. You don't have to compulsorily play the game, to enjoy the film. Newcomers will love it just as much. The animation is spectacular. The 3D is perfect. When the birds start launching from the catapult, you feel like you are right in the middle of the game. The dialog delivery of the voice cast, elevates the film to new levels of hilarity. Jason Sudeikis is outstanding as Red. Sudeikis perfectly captures Red's cynicism. Josh Gad is mind blowing as Chuck. Gad voices Chuck with the same enthusiasm that he had, when he voiced Olaf in Frozen(2013). Danny McBride is fantastic as Bomb. I like the fact that McBride subtly changes his voice, to portray Bomb. Maya Rudolph is awesome as Matilda. Bill Hader is superb as Leonard. Peter Dinklage is hysterical as Mighty Eagle. Sean Penn is impressive as Terence. Keegan Michael-Key is great as Judge Peckinpah. Kate McKinnon is good as Stella. Tony Hale is hilarious as Mime. The supporting cast is effective. The Angry Birds Movie is a must watch, for the entire family. Whether you love the game, or not."
49,The Angry Birds Movie,7,15 May 2016,Pretty good.,"While the story isn't the best, this film is good for kids and has plenty of good things about it. I enjoyed it.I really liked the animation- it was pleasant to look at and was very colourful.The characters were pretty likable too. I like some of the main characters most.While I haven't played much angry birds, from what I know, it had quite a few elements from the games in the movie (which I know not all video game movies do the best) The humour isn't the best, but it will make younger children giggle and there were a few funny moments. I recommend this film to young kids."
50,The Angry Birds Movie,6,22 July 2016,Bland and without substance,"Given the multitude the flightless birds have covered via its endearing game, the Angry Birds movie falls far away from its tree. It doesn't come close to meeting the levels of jaunt Rovio Entertainment had set out on through its gaming venture. Things that stop it from hitting the spot are  bland story, vapid shenanigans, mediocre humour, and absence of real substance to keep things together.WHAT THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE REALLY IS The Angry Birds Movie is more like having a conversation with an angry Jason Sudeikis. It doesn't have a real direction and stretches out beyond limit till their nemeses arrive; an inevitable rock-bottom that we all knew was coming. A character portrait of Mighty Eagle was shoehorned into the tale to kill time, which apparently seemed more like a clichéd sub- plot, something we all have seen thousands of times in animated movies. Peter Dinklage makes it better though, no doubt.COMPLETELY HOLLOW The weirdest thing about The Angry Birds Movie is that 20 minutes in it and you know how hollow the movie is. It is as if nobody really cared that they were making a movie. You could almost hear yourself in the backdrop  the movie-makers might have thought, ""Let's put that joke, let's squeeze in a funny line like that. THAT would be funny!"" Music is more like no matter what stuff is played it only comes out as their trademark song.Though there is entertainment imbibed but it is more like in parts, and with no real connection to each other. So if you could pull them out, the whole flick would fall apart. It is almost like someone from the company who was tired of playing the game, filled with apprehension of them losing business got up in epiphany and shouted, ""Hey guys! I know how to ensure we stay in business. Let's make a movie!"" BRIGHT SIDE To look at the bright side, you have chubby cute birds that make your day. A funny character called Chuck that makes the movie enjoyable. Rest is a mere deliberate attempt to tickle you.THE FINAL VERDICT The Angry Birds Movie will lighten your mood though, but there is nothing like a classy witticism to throw you into fits of laughter.

51,The Angry Birds Movie,8,5 July 2016,"""A-well-a, everybody's heard about the bird Bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word.""","Despite never having owned a phone suitable for the game,I've been able to hear about it thanks to politicians regularly getting caught playing it instead of focusing on the matters at hand.With the trailer making it look better than a number of offerings from the ""Video game adaptation"" genre,I felt that it was time to find out if the bird is the word.The plot:Getting on the wrong side with everyone in Bird Island,Red is sent to anger management classes.At the classes Red meets silent Terrence and Charles ""Chuck"", Bomb,who causes the building to blow up! Landing on Bird Island,a ship of pigs from ""Piggy Island"" claim that they have arrived on the island to build a friendship with the birds.Putting their doubts aside,the birds start to party along with the crowd.Stand out from the crowd,Red starts to suspect that the pigs are planning a secret trap.View on the film:Backed by a stomping Rock soundtrack, Jason Sudeikis gives a charming performance as Red,whose grumpiness Sudeikis delivers with a real relish.Joined by a cheeky cameo from Sean Penn and a booming Danny McBride, Peter Dinklage gives a wonderfully flamboyant performance as ageing ""hero"" Mighty Eagle.Making their directing debut, Clay Kaytis & Fergal Reilly sling the Angry Birds across the screen in a whirlwind of colour,with the sharp animation of the Birds lighting the screen in bursts of primary red,yellows and blues (and piggy green!)Along with the title characters,the directors skilfully fire explosive action scenes in the sky,with each fight scene allowing the unique features of each Angry Bird to be highlighted.Taking a slightly different route to other Video game adaptations,the screenplay by John Cohen/Mikael Hed/Mikko Pöllä & Jon Vitti wisely leaves any attempt to build a ""mythology"",to instead strike with a fun Action Comedy.Offering up worms of witty lines and fast-paced action,the writers also send a good message about standing out,and being an individual, angry bird."
52,The Angry Birds Movie,,2 June 2016,Powerful allegorical movie to todays European crisis,"It is a very intelligent movie done in the same spirit as Orwell's animal farm animation.""Red"" the protagonist is a masculine hot tempered young adult with a past of being ostracized by the community for his love of old outdated ideals and a tendency for anger though not violence. When the community is met by an outside threat their civilization of ""happy birds"" who are feminized and do not possess the primitive threat recognition capability of Red embrace the outsiders with friendship. It is up to Red to find out what the outsiders of the tribe are really up too.There is much symbolism in this movie, specifically the burning down of the welcome center which is a clear reference to what happened at a Greece welcome center. The looting and rampant destruction of neighborhoods to the oblivious apathetic response of the citizenry. A reference to ISIS (Islamic State) when Red clearly asks that there no way to identify all the immigrants. Pigs welcome signs and parties celebrating diversity.The Eggs I think is a reference to ""wealth"" or ""capital"" as Eggs are often used in symbology to gold. The outsiders are after the eggs to take it for themselves, in reality it is the outsider elite and his council that takes all of it while his throng of people as low intelligence followers incapable of ruling themselves as free people. A criticism of third world dictatorships and Imams."
53,The Angry Birds Movie,7,26 May 2016,Slightly Tepid Birds,"My review of Angry Birds (spoiler free)***1/2 Cast: Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader and Golden Globe winner Peter Dinklage* Plot overview: Find out why the birds are so angry. When an island populated by happy, flightless birds is visited by mysterious green piggies, it's up to three unlikely outcasts - Red, Chuck and Bomb - to figure out what the pigs are up to.Angry Birds has been a worldwide phenomenon for many years now and usually movies based on games especially mobile games don't normally get a good reception, but this, this is probably the best game based movie I have ever seen.When the movie was announced by Sony a lot of people gave a bad name straight away but then again so did I, but when it was released the people who gave it a bad name liked it. When I saw it I thought it was a really fun animation and an a really interesting take on a mobile game.The reasons why I think this is a must see animation: Origin: Angry Birds started life as a mobile game and it's popularity just exploded in a matter of months. Just to think seven years later it still remains to be extremely popular and a with a unique adaptation I think it will still be popular many years to came.Action: The action is a formidable choice for a movie like this but I think it was a good choice because the action is well used, and well made if a little flat but I'll get to that in a second. With the characters having their own unique fighting skill it certainly shows that the people who made this made a good adaptation it was very funny and fun for the whole family.My initial mark for this movie was going to be 8 out of 10 but the reason for the actual mark is because it fell flat here is the reason why that is: Much like the game: When the movie go to the action part I thought it was fun at first but then it fell a little flat because the movie started to look like the game, which isn't a bad thing but it's not a good thing either.Other than that fact I thought this was a well made silly and fun animation that the whole family will love.Verdict: Silly, fun and just a good time if a little flat near the end. 7/10 recommended.*2012 - Best performance by an actor in a Supporting Role Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television, Game of Thrones (2011)"
54,The Angry Birds Movie,10,23 June 2016,Best cartoon ever,"I can not believe how happy I became after watching this excellent movie. After watching the amazing trailer, It is noting. you have to see the movie for enjoy it.The story of angry birds is about flightless birds who are happily living except for one who is called Red. Red did not satisfy with his life because he have many problems with other birds so he get angry. His angry temper made him attend management class, where he meets birds who have been suffering of disenchantment in life just like him (Chuck) and Bomb.The birds are suddenly visited by green pigs, who are dumb but funny. The birds and pigs quickly befriend each other, but Red does not trust the pigs at all. Angry bird Red investigate the real reason behind the sudden occupation of the pigs. Angry bird Red with his teams including speedy Chuck (Josh Gad), and the volatile Bomb (Danny McBride) and legend eagle destroyed pig's plan which was stealing bird's eggs and eating them. Finally, red with his friends found the way to live happy in bird's island and they become hero."
55,The Angry Birds Movie,8,6 October 2016,Nice. Picturesque and eclectic. Merry. A very pleasant movie!,"Hilarious. Silly. Action-packed (everything goes ta-dam, cities and castles crash in the fire, birdies and piggies are screaming, running away, and nobody knows what's happening). Everyone in the movie is an idiot (birds, because they cannot understand Mr. Leo's making fools of them. And the piggies, because they just want to have some eggs for dinner. They don't really get, if that's such a big fault to be pursued and beaten).The piggies are bad, of course. But that's what makes them adorkable (I could even say, it adds to their nicety). So, if I choose between Leo's folks and Red's comrades... let me choose neither. They're all alike, charming and brainless.Now the character which is little use here for me is the Eagle. He just sits on his mountain and makes everybody (including us, the viewers) waste our time on his banjo playing. Sure, he relents at the end, and even gets a monument from the grateful bird people. (That was a hilarious joke, when he looked at his own portrait, and suddenly felt ashamed before himself. But I daresay that was the only funny moment about him).The cartoon as a whole is not worse from other Sony children's works. For example, it reminded me of The Pirates - just as much merriment, just as much madness, just as much unobtrusive moral. (Yes, The Pirates are one of a kind, I know. But this is as close to them as possibly may be. If you want to experience the pure childish joy of going wild and letting your instincts free, this 'toon will give you two hours of positiveness). I highly recommend to watch it, even if you're not familiar with the game. (Who isn't, though?)"
56,The Angry Birds Movie,8,5 October 2016,A Movie For Every Birdy,"On May 20, 2016, the Angry Birds moved from the small screen on your iPhone to the big screen at the theater. At first, ""The Angry Birds Movie"" may seem like a complete joke. It is a movie based of a game about exploding birds trying to kill a bunch of pigs. However, the movie finds a deeper meaning to all of the chaos and is not bad for an app-based movie. In the movie, the birds combine their various attributes and save their eggs, proving that everyone has a special talent and a unique contribution to the world. In addition, the humor made it a movie that everyone must see.The movie begins with Red, a bird whose quick-temper lands him in anger management classes. There, he meets four birds: Chuck, a hyperactive yellow bird, Bomb, a large black bird who resembles his name and explodes when he is angry, Terrance, a giant red bird, and Matilda, their white-colored anger management instructor. At first, they do not get along. However, when the pigs invade the birds' island and steal the eggs, the group works together to defeat the pigs with the help of the other birds.When the birds go to the pig's island to retrieve their eggs, they use their individual talents to defeat them. Bomb uses his tendency to explode to blow up the village. Chuck uses his super speed to fly fast and ram through walls. Finally, Red uses anger as leadership to motivate the other birds to take revenge on the pigs. In the end, the birds get their eggs back and the anger management birds are accepted back into the bird society. If it was not for each birds' unique contribution to retrieving the eggs, the eggs would have been devoured by the pigs. Instead, their various talents brought the bird community together and made them victorious.Beside the lessons, the movie was hilarious. First, the writers seemed to use almost every pig joke that ever existed. In addition, there is one scene where Bomb and Chuck are swimming in a pool of water, and something unexpected happens that you must see. I promise that the movie will keep you laughing.""The Angry Birds Movie"" is a must-see for everyone, from children to adults. It not only provides humor, but it provides lessons for children to learn as well. It is a movie you could watch multiple times and it still will not get old. Every birdy will love it."
57,The Angry Birds Movie,8,18 September 2016,Never underestimate the power of Birds...And Eggs!,"The first thing that was lovable is the graphics. The detailing used is really dazzling and all the footage I've seen is impressively pretty and the designs are well done!The movie is an enjoyable one and at the end of the day you might smile thinking of some cute scenes inside. There are few surprising scenes that you won't expect in these kind of flicks.A good extension to the game franchise that glued children of almost all ages to the mobile.I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com . It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended."
58,The Angry Birds Movie,9,16 August 2016,A smartly written and produced animated film that pleases the fans . . .,"Angry Birds the Movie was released on Redbox today and my kids watched it this evening.  I noticed that the movie actually hits the right notes for anyone that has enjoyed playing the Angry Birds game app.I remembered how my kids acquired plush toys of the various Angry Birds characters over the last several years and they had some intense pretend play sessions with those toys so, when they were watching the Angry Birds movie for the first time, they were totally eating it up.I have not been a fan of Donald Trump but, watching Angry Birds The Movie for the first time, stimulated my imagination about current events. The whole theme of this movie seemed to embody the Trump campaign platform. ""Keep the bad people from coming into our country and sometimes there are situations were it's right to get angry.""I'm loosing my appetite for computer animated movies, with my aging but, this Angry Birds movie turned out better than I expected and I enjoyed it, especially the last half.The producers and writers for this movie took a vague and ambiguous theme and turned it all into a smartly written and produced animated film that pleases the fans of the Angry Birds game app."
59,The Angry Birds Movie,7,10 August 2016,Better than expected,"Well, 100 minutes of good entertainment. The movie is fun, has a good balance between rhythm and comedy. And surprisingly could be watched even if you never played the related game. I had some prejudice, but the film is unexpectedly quite good. The characters are really well done, all of them with good personality, and very well animated. The story flow very easily, never boring, with tons of laughs. The visual part of the movie is really enjoyable, well balanced in term of colors and level of detail. The perception of CGI is never present, everything looks like very natural. I Enjoyed also the soundtrack, a mix of old songs and modern music."
60,The Angry Birds Movie,3,29 July 2016,You'll feel like you've had a bird crap and vomit on you,"3.4 of 10. If having a bird crap and vomit on you is your idea of a good time, you may enjoy the green pork and white eggs this film offers. I'm not sure how they coaxed Sean Penn into this. Maybe a favor for a friend. The rest of the cast isn't surprising or add anything to it. Probably just happy to get a good paying Sony gig.The animation and drawing is solid, more natural and better than a game, so game and cartoon lovers might get some enjoyment out of that. But beyond the technical visual and sound aspects, the story and characters are disappointing and poorly thought out.About the only story element that I enjoyed involved how communities openly trusting and welcoming of traveling carnival acts passing through town are likely to be conned and lose heavily in the deal."
61,The Angry Birds Movie,7,11 June 2016,A good treat for everyone,"The Angry Birds Movie,"" a fast, fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise that, at its zenith, had children of all ages glued to their smartphone screens. Rich in color, energy and perfectly dreadful puns, this film adaptation of the Finnish gaming phenomenon surpasses all cynical expectations. The voice of Jason Sudeikis for Mr. Red was fantastic and the movie made justice to the Angry Birds games we enjoy playing. The Angry Birds Movie is way better than most viewers would expect. I enjoyed the movie very much and hope the viewers would be getting same satisfaction when they play the game. I go with 7/10 for this amazingly crafted movie"
62,The Angry Birds Movie,9,18 July 2016,"Definitely worth your time, and guarantees multiple laughs","While this movie is still criticized for various reasons (as many video-game movies are), I believe that we can all come to terms and agree that this is one of the better video-game movies (I will gladly eat my words if Assassin's Creed outdoes the other video-game movies, critically and/or commercially). This movie is very well designed and does an amazing job of putting a story on the birds from the video-game that at LEAST 3 billion people know and love (almost HALF the Earth's population). The movie also does a good job of putting a entertaining story-line on such a simple concept of a game (even the introduction of the slingshot - sort of - fits well). Every character in this movie has a highly entertaining (and funny) part of themselves. With Mighty Eagle's incompetence, Leanord's (or King Mudbeard's) behavior towards... everything, to even Chuck's hyper-activeness (the slow-mo scene puts some competition towards X-Men: Days of the Future Past). There are also MANY pig references (as in, references to poems and other things pig- related you heard when you were a kid) There are many of references to the game itself, and many to other franchises.All in all, this is a very entertaining movie and is definitely worth watching even once.Just know that there are a LOT of dirty references (even a direct Bird's & Bee's Fertility Center), and even substitutions for cursing (which does fit well). This does make the movie more entertaining.This movie about angry birds fighting against egg-stealing pigs will CRACK you up (please kill me)."
63,The Angry Birds Movie,10,22 August 2016,Amazing Just Like The Game!!!!,This movie was amazing i loved everything about this movie i loved how they showed off how the name angry birds meant and how they made the game somewhat like the movie and even when the pigs stole there eggs at the end they tried to become there friends and betrayed them and thats how it showed from the game they stole the eggs but they didn't show us how but now they do i love this movie i hope they make another one because that would be amazing i rate it a 10/10 but the only thing that bothered me a little bit is i think that there was suppose to be more angry birds but that doesn't matter to me this movie was amazing im definitely buying this on blu-ray and i think you should to and i definitely recommend you watching it this movie was great.
64,The Angry Birds Movie,10,20 August 2016,Bad reviews are Crazy People,"There are so many bad reviews for this movie. Most say that its good but not great. For some reason i have found that if a movie isn't a blockbuster or DEEPLY DEEPLY moving then its not considered a successful movie in the eyes of critics. Every movie cannot be ""ROOM"" or ""AVATAR"". This is the first review i have ever left and i had to do it. I feel that a great injustice has been done here. This movie is fabulous for children and adults. It was great fun for the whole family. It was superb. I feel like these bad ratings will stop a sequel and i really hope it doesn't. It is a great film and a sequel would be so cool. Thanks"
65,The Angry Birds Movie,5,29 July 2016,Could've been better,"Angry Birds Movie is a movie based off of the hit game/app, called Angry Birds. There was also a cartoon that came out back in 2013 called Angry Birds Toon which has also received mediocre reviews and may have also been an unnecessary adaptation, though I haven't seen it. But what's different is that this one gives the birds legs and dialogue to work with.It stars Red, a hot-headed red bird who reacts childishly to almost everything. Now, I am not a fan of irritable characters but in some scenes, I could see why the things that annoy him would be annoying, like for instance, a bird sitting next to you sneezing on your popcorn while you're trying to enjoy a movie.Red and his friends, the crybaby, Bomb, and the hyperactive, crazy Chuck encounter pigs, who want to destroy the island. So, the kind- hearted Red and his friends must do something to try to stop them, which includes acting angry and using slingshots while also using special powers (now, I don't remember that in the game).The character Chuck is usually really annoying. I don't see what's the deal with him zipping around but they could've developed his character more. He rarely has his moments where he's being kind, but unfortunately, it's stopped by Red, who's better but is still a mediocre character.Bomb sometimes whines and it gets pretty annoying. Terrence is probably the best character out of this that I could think of. He's above average as he can be a little too aloof but his grunts are pretty funny and he does have some redemption towards the end. His character is inconsistent overall.The movie tries to stay true to the franchise, but it has some unrealistic moments like the birds using special powers (now, I don't know if there is a game where that could happen, but if there isn't, put that in a game!) And I don't know how the baby birds can sing that well already and the village be restored that fast.The animation and character designs are kind of cute, they do have some flaws but they're alright.This was an unnecessary, corny adaptation to the game. Though, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it does have some funny moments. It relies unnecessarily on crude humor. And the mid-credits scenes were annoying."
66,The Angry Birds Movie,7,21 May 2016,"""Why So Angry?""","Rovio Entertainment and Sony Pictures Entertainment built a great final product, within the limits of cinematographic quality adaptations about video games.Despite of that the fame of the digital game already isn't in vehemence, it did in 2009, when Finnish Rovio games company decided to sell a video game based on angry birds and green pigs. So huge was its success that seven years later, a film adaptation has been established in the theaters around the world, while retaining the same color palette of the game, its main characters and even a song from the original. However, its characters aren't the only ones angry, spectators are really angry to see the silly and unbalanced screenplay of the story. In certain way, the extravagant colors, cheap jokes, and even references manage to hide that lack, even so, lack is evident. Nevertheless, ""Angry Birds Movie"" is the greater favorite video game adaptation in the summer season, with the support of adolescents, adults and most children. At least at the box office amass more fortune than its competitors due to the level of recognition, although ""Warcraft"" and ""Assassin's Creed"" may give the fight.Fortunately, Sony film is not worthy of the ratings and opinions negative by the audience, well, at least not of all. The expectations for this film were too low, due to the complicated and arduous work to create a story with so few elements, adding to this, the little experience evidenced in previous adaptations of electronic games. Sony gets to engage in a true animated movie, failing in its terrible script, creating lack of chemistry and consistency, not very present in neighboring companies (Diney - Pixar and even Dreamworks). Bird design is beautiful, majestic and excellently projected, its colors, textures, personalities and sizes make this adventure, a real game of ""Angry Birds"".We meddle in its main scarcity, ""The Lego Movie"" is a clear reference of a flawless screenplay. Perhaps, screenplay by Jon Vitti (Alvin and the Chipmunks) is simple and limited by the almost nil tools on which they are based, hampering the creation of characters more deep. They thought that by being a film directed mainly to the public children, the plot should be simple and clear, without much depth or complexity in order to solve the basic questions of the game.Why are angry the ""Angry Birds""?In an anthropomorphic world, all kinds of birds coexist in a peaceful, fun, colorful and friendly place (an island), all but Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) a embittered and resentful bird with life since child due to his physical appearance, his temperament was not the best and he is forced to attend classes to control his anger with the beautiful and delicate Matilda (voiced by Maya Rudolph). There, he finds to his three companions of adventures, Chuck (voiced by Josh Gad) an animated yellow canary with speed powers (with a clear scene referenced to 'Quicksilver' (""X-MEN"")), Bomb (voiced by Danny McBride) a black, bomb-shaped bird, which cannot control his temper and simply explodes and finally and less present Terrence (voiced by Senn Pean) a biggish red bird with noble feelings. The group of misfits will have to save their city from the dangerous and malicious green pigs, an unprecedented adventure began.""Angry Birds"" pleases to infants with a predictable, colorful and entertaining story, but also meets with ironic humor to the public adult with perfect and clear references to ""The Shining"", ""X-MEN"" and classic Tex Avery gags. If the screenplay had not been so redundant in the themes and repetitive objectives in animated films (the family, the hero, save your city, happy ending), would be the perfect blend with high quality graphic effects. We consider, this film like a game of ""Angry Birds"", where all pigs have been defeated, but the final score doesn't reaches three stars of score."
67,The Angry Birds Movie,1,12 July 2016,Ignore All The Fake 10/10 Reviews,"I normally enjoy a good animation movie like Finding Nemo or the Kung Fu Panda movies but this crap is just terrible. I can't say that I was too impressed with Rio either but Angry Birds is on a whole other level of crap. It should be called Angry Turds. I don't usually write reviews unless I think something is either really good or else it's so bad I couldn't in good conscience let some poor sucker sit through this without giving them fair warning. Twenty minutes in and honestly I don't think I could watch another minute. If you don't believe me watch the first twenty minutes for yourself and then tell me whether or not you think all those 10/10 reviews are fake or not. Seriously not even a one year old could find this entertaining. Unless they have fired everyone and I mean everyone that was involved with any part of the first twenty minutes I could not recommend watching any further that's how bad this movie sucks. There's just no humour, you can tell they're trying to do some kind of visual humour to appeal to kids but it just falls flats on it's face. The only way your kid would enjoy watching this is if they are severely retarded."
68,The Angry Birds Movie,1,5 December 2016,Who was this movie written for?,"This is one boring movie, filled with adult innuendo and a nonsensical story line --- and that's coming from someone who loves the game! I mean, honestly, am I supposed to take my kids to this piece of tripe? I don't want them to see most of what actually goes on in the movie ... but the movie is too inane to actual adults. Ugh. Who was this movie written for, anyway?Oh good grief, IMDb requires that I write a ten-line review. From a peeing eagle to strip-tease pigs to telling kids that balloons are fine to lose in the ocean because fish love them and they're good for the tummy, I literally can't say little enough about this movie. Frankly, it's a bit unfair for IMDb to threaten to block accounts for not venting long enough, it precludes the possibility that a movie is SO BAD that it doesn't deserve more words. I am fortunate, however, it gave me the chance to re-evaluate my vote. I changed it from 2 to 1."
69,The Angry Birds Movie,6,16 June 2016,As Enjoyable as I wanted it to be,"This is a movie that I was ACTUALLY looking forward to see. I've been a fan of the game from it's inception and I've played it a lot ever since. I would never call myself a die hard fan, but I enjoy the games enough to watch any animations that come out of this product. Saying that, the angry birds toons were wonderfully made, that one Star Wars short they did was beautifully animated, so for this movie, I was at the very least expecting great animation with striking visuals. That is EXACTLY what I got, and that alone would put this movie on a 6 out of 10.Animation wise this movie is BEAUTIFUL, probably the best animated movie in the sense that the visuals have been the most interesting I've seen so far this year. Surpassing Kung Fu Panda 3 and Zootopia, I find this movie so colourful and pleasant to watch, I could watch this movie on mute and STILL enjoy it to it's fullestIn story it is very weak. Mighty eagle in particular felt very cliché, do they do play around with his cliché character a bit, but not enough to be very funny. Also very predictable storyline, you can pretty much guess what's going to happen by just watching the trailers.However, what elevates this from a 6 to 7 for me is the character of RED, whom I found surprisingly relatable. Keep in mind, I was just expecting this movie to make me laugh and entertain me a bit, but I found myself really identifying with RED's cynicism and arc. Being a grump because of how people treat him and have treated him in the past but still desiring to hang out like a normal bird with everyone else, even though he's unable to open up to start a relationship with anyone. So I was very pleased with his resolution.Overall, if you like the game, watch the movie. Worst case scenario, you'll enjoy it but never want to watch it again"
70,The Angry Birds Movie,7,29 May 2016,Invaders want to eat their eggs?,"It was an interesting film. I wonder how many people viewing the film will get the connection between pigs invading a bird colony to steal their eggs, making this method of reproduction their food--and humans doing the same thing. There were a lot of creative antics and cultural jokes throughout the movie. I just feel better watching the movie knowing that I am not one of the pigs who goes in and steals bird eggs and claims it is my food, nor do I pay other people to do that for me. Cute little movie with kid jokes and adult jokes too! I wasn't familiar with the angry birds going in, but I got a good idea from the film. I like posting good reviews of 8 lines but they won't let me do that, I had to add an extra couple."
71,The Angry Birds Movie,10,12 July 2016,Angry Birds is an excellent work,"I've read some of the reviews from metacritic section, and in one of the negative reviews- actually by Roger Moore from Movie Nation magazine states that Sudeikis "" has virtually nothing funny to say "". But the fact is that the main character Red for whom the role is given to Sudeikis is really just an ANGRY BIRD! Cant expect something funny from someone like that, on the contrary tho the gags came from the conjunction between Red's grumpy angry mood with the situation, and proved hilarious every minute. The graphics and artwork is actually better than expected, that even the small detail on every feather and background movement can be seen. And the audio is really good, the role by each of the characters works, because they can do rage to cute, subtle to hilarious weird voices like those of Mighty Eagle battlecry noises. Overall its a great movie and deserved better, rated it a 10/10 coz it received such an unexpectedly low rating, which is not reasonable for a great movie like this. And wanna add one more thing- Critics! Watch every movie with a lil less prejudice. Seems you based the score on the voice actors and production companies. We get that from the review you make."
72,The Angry Birds Movie,6,26 July 2016,Average - mediocre,"Nothing special really. Some good ideas here and there, some laughs but nothing to die for. Being an adult that loves this kind of movies, this is just my adult opinion. Watching this one was money and time wasted. It was really compatible to the Rovio concept of the game, with some nice links to it, but apart from that, I think that nothing else was great about this movie. Come to think of it from the children perspective, I am not sure how it can be OK to have a bird that can explode and then continue to live like nothing happened. I mean, I know that kids are not stupid, but what will happen if someone gets the notion that they can blow up and then go about their way doing the next thing. I mean, isn't this too dangerous? Maybe I am being paranoid but this fact certainly stood out. Anyway, overall, don't even think about wasting your time with this one. Definitely not worth it... Better luck next time Rovio!"
73,The Angry Birds Movie,6,31 May 2016,An animated movie based on a game that isn't that bad,"The Angry Birds Movie is an animated film based on the mobile app of the same name and stars Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Peter Dinklage, Maya Rudolph, Sean Penn, and Bill Hader. it's about an island inhabited with happy smiling birds. one of the birds named Red (played by Jason Sudeikis) is not happy at all, in fact he is an angry bird. due to this, the judge sends him to an anger management class where he meets Chuck (played by Josh Gad) and Bomb (played by Danny McBride). during one of the classes, a ship filled with pigs docks the island and starts showing off inventions and gadgets the birds have never seen before, to distract them so they can take their eggs that they lay and eat them back at home. Red Chuck and Bomb discover this and rally the birds to get angry and steal their eggs back from piggy island, via giant slingshot.getting to the basics are my initial thoughts on the film:This movie isn't bad by any means necessary, but it isn't great hence the above average rating. it does have a lot of Pros and a lot of Cons. Pros: the animation is perfectly done, the voice acting is good and i did get some chuckles here and there and the climax is amazing and it's where the movie truly shines in it's animation.Cons: things happen and it has no place in the story, it can be unnecessarily noisy, and a lot of the jokes fall flat. the rendering on the animation isn't that strong, and the story is all over the place. Mighty Eagle is an annoying stupid clichéd character that has been done to death. I hate him a lot as well as a lot of the birds that give Red such a hard time. too many sex jokes that doesn't really seem suitable for children and aren't even ""wink-wink do ya get it"" kind of jokes.More cons than pros on a very entertaining video game movie, which is saying a lot. your kids will probably like it, but outside of that it's an average film for families."
74,The Angry Birds Movie,6,22 May 2016,LOL movie for relaxing time,"This is the movie that made for game's fan, Kids and adult who has kid's mine(That is me!).If you are not a person that I mentioned this movie may make you get bored and not enjoy much.Angry bird's story-line is not complicated, it is easy predictable and also it is not creative as inside out. The animation movie from SONY is still unable to compare with DreamWorks and Walt Disney.(whole different level!) However this is a good and really fun movie. Every scenes is composed of colorful and awesome beautiful graphics. there is many unexpectedly scenes that will make you LOL."
75,The Angry Birds Movie,9,4 August 2016,Fun Pop Culture Reference,"Angry Birds was full of computer generated physical comedy. Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly brought out a much different side of birds from Alfred Hitchcock. Peter Dinklage's burnt out swashbuckler surprised everyone in Pete Oswald's wonderful Bird and Piggy Islands. Josh Gad acted out a devious ""Speedy Gonzalez"" type of character. Danny McBride delivered more of a sumo wrestler. These two characters met Jason Sudeikis's portrayal of a mis-understood radical in Maya Rudolph's cheerful service. Keegan- Michael Key and Bill Hader played out power-hungry materialists though one finally fell for a Trojan horse ploy of the other. Sony Pictures Imageworks positively gave the original video game's story line a Hollywood treatment!"
76,The Angry Birds Movie,,12 May 2016,"Rovio Animation nailed the quality, just the story sucked.","As the title says rovio are definitely the next big contenders in the animation studio game. The quality was there and it didn't feel cheap. As for the movie, if your over 14 don't bother.Im not saying its really bad but its exactly what you think it would be. Cheesy story line, predictable heroes v villains. They have kept it safe to make it work. And that's what it does it just works.Nothing exciting or crazy to talk about it'll be a movie you can say you've watched but wont be one you bring to a mates house or even steal one liners from. Im leaving it with a 6 out of 10 but if you need 90 minutes to do shopping etc. Drop your kids off keep them entertained."
77,The Angry Birds Movie,1,22 June 2016,And I Thought the Game Ruffled My Feathers,"The entire concept of birds sacrificing themselves to knock pigs off construction sets is easily an idea I could have come up with last Friday night at 2:30am after a strong overdose. But who cares, right? That's what makes Angry Birds so oddly engaging to play! So of course, this is the perfect material to make a motion picture out of! And you know what, The Angry Birds Movie is the most beautiful, most thoughtful experience I've ever sat through in a cinema, met with some wonderful characters, hilarious gags, and a message that is suitable for all ages.Ha! Had you there, didn't I? Gosh, I almost had to force myself to type that. Right from this film's announcement, I was expecting this movie to be just a series of super unfunny gags only toddlers would find funny, along with a real overused message to make this feel like somewhat of a complete movie. And sure enough, the result met all my expectations to the tee. I mean, come on. I have always enjoyed the iPhone game, but how could a 97-minute story of these birds possibly be decent?Well, just like this:Step 1. You make the main character an underdog with an anger issue who is disrespected by the town. Step 2. You set up his team through an anger management class. Step 3. You introduce the green pigs as the main villains a quarter of the way through the movie. Step 4. You make the main character the only one in the town who knows how to stop these bad pigs. Step 5. You let these bad pigs steal the eggs of the birds in the town in order to eat them. Step 6. You make the town's savior an absolute moron who the main character loses hope in. Step 7. You save the actual game-playing part until the final moments, and only for five minutes tops. Step 8. You throw in puns. Lots and lots of puns.I've gone crazy now after hearing, ""Happy hatch-day, Pluck my life, Insta-ham, and Kevin Bacon in Hamlet."" But you know what? Toucan play at this. If this movie can go mad with bird and pig puns, so can I!The movie's egg-selent screenwriter Jon Vitti got his start writing adult comedies such as SNL and The Simpsons, and maybe he should have left his nest there. While he does sprinkle in some jokes that will fly over the kids' heads, a majority of the humor here is winging it toward the 12 and younger crowd. But maybe that's not the problem. Maybe the problem is that he wrote out each character rather faithfully to their virtual counterparts, yet entirely unmotivated and all-around fowl. Every bird and pig in this movie is either:A. Useless B. Rude C. Dumb D. All the above Owl go with option D.You know that white egg-shaped bird named Matilda? She's the teacher of the anger management class now, and is all sweet and calm, despite being an ""angry"" bird. Then that yellow triangle-shaped bird named Chuck is voiced by Josh Gad, and he is literally Olaf on crack. His best friend is that black bomb bird, and together they are so annoying that you ought to flip the bird at each of them. The enormous bird, named Terence, is the closest thing to funny this movie gets to, and he just flew right by without enough screen time. Then there's the little blue bird that splits into three, who doesn't even show up until the end-credits scene. Oh, and I guess there's Red. Yeah, no comment.The world of these birds is also rather cheep. Basically it is all recreated from the designs in the game as well as the Toon series. I'm sure it is a beautiful and creative world on screen, but I couldn't exactly tell, as everything in the frame was moving too fast for me to get a good look at the details. But essentially, the most genius thing they come up with is a pregnant bird carrying her egg strapped onto her stomach like a pregnant human. Yeah, seriously what the duck?!The jokes probably would have quacked me up if the animators actually took a breather in between each pratfall and each piece of rapid- fire dialogue. Also, if some jokes were removed entirely, that would help enormously. By jokes, I mean nipple gags, a bird beating up a statue, a malfunctioning stairway, and an eagle peeing into a pond for a full minute (yes, this movie actually resorts to that hawkward level of humor).Okay fine, maybe there are a few redeeming messages. It does try to affirm that anger is good motivation to fighting for the right causes, but it's entirely forgotten by the last few moments and is even deliberately mocked by the characters themselves. So yeah, no important values to be found here!I'm talon you, if a movie about the Angry Birds really needed to exist, then it should have be done by artists who actually gave a hoot to the kids and the parents who had the birden of allowing the ticket prices to go on their bill. But even judging by an Angry Birds fan, this movie is not boosting the popularity of the franchise in any way. If anything, it's just going to hurt the franchise. So stick with the game, there's no peeing eagles.Overall Grade: F"
78,The Angry Birds Movie,6,20 May 2016,"""Harmless Film""","The Angry Birds movie may have a great animation and that's it,nothing else good to say.This better for children than for adults,of course cause it's a kid's film but out of all the animated films I saw in the past years,Animated films can be smart and can be enjoyed by two demographics.This film on the other hand felt like it's just for kids to enjoy.The characters are well animated except for the pigs which are all of them look the same sometimes.The main character,Red is kind a bit annoying,not like able or even lovable,he is just annoying,Chuck is is sometimes funny and sometimes just again annoying,Bomb is the only thing I like,he is not that annoying at all. They tried so hard to to make their jokes work but it felt forced and overall not good at all,some jokes are for adults but again it felt forced and not funny.They really tried but failed.Jokes are just really cliché. Story on the other hand is bland and seems predictable.The voice acting are okay .The Angry Birds is just another cliché kid's film with a bland story and predictable jokes.Out of all the animated film of the year this isn't as bad as Rachet and Clank and Of course Norm The North but I might say it's mediocre at best and also harmless.It will be forgotten in the next few years,I think.Just watch The Nice Guys and leave your kids to watch this film."
79,The Angry Birds Movie,3,15 May 2017,A terrible adaptation of a pretty addicting video game.,"I'm not going to lie. The idea for an Angry Birds movie actually did appeal to me for some reason. I did like the video game. It was pretty fun and really addicting causing the game to be one of the most download smartphone apps of all time. The game had also made a series of animated shorts that actually not that bad. So, I did have hopes for ""The Angry Birds Movie"" to be pretty decent. That was a mistake I made. A huge mistake I made, because this movie is just awful. I mean, really bad. It's certainly not one of the worst animated movies ever made, but trust me. It's an absolutely terrible movie.The story of the movie focuses on Red (Jason Sudeikis) a bird whose anger problems end him up in an anger management class along with four others like Chuck (Josh Gad), Bomb (Danny McBride), Matilda (Maya Rudolph), and Terrence (Sean Penn). If you want to know why Red acts this way, it turns out he had one of those clichéd backstories where it's revealed that he was bullied by the other birds his age because he has no parents and has big eyebrows. After being in the class for some time, a boatload of pigs arrive at the island where they live, lead by a king pig (Bill Hader) who decides to become friends with the birds. However, it turns out to be a lie because the pigs take all the eggs from the birds and leaves the island so they can eat them on their own island. The birds turn to Red for help and it's up to him and his friends from the anger management class to follow the pigs and get back the eggs.I should have realized the doom I was heading into when I realized that the screenwriter worked on ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" which is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. The story is not the worst thing about the movie. It does follow the video game rather faithfully, right down to the slingshots. However, it's really clichéd. It has scenes we've seen so many times in other movies with no changes. The characters, on the other hand, are awful. I never liked a single solitary character in this entire movie. Every single character in this movie was either annoying, stupid, or just jerks and I hated every single one of them, particular are main character Red who I think said over twenty puns in the span of an hour and a half. Speaking of the puns, the jokes are another horrible thing about this film. The jokes in this film range from being disgusting to inappropriate. These jokes really annoyed me and disgusted me to the point that I decided would never show my kids this film. For example, there was a scene where a character was reading a book Fifty Shades of Green. Yeah, good idea promoting a book that has tons of sex in it in a kids movie. The only good thing in this entire film was the animation. It looked very pretty had nice colors and looked at least like an Angry Birds movie. I just wish that I put the movie on mute so I didn't have to listen to the horrendous dialogue. Overall, I really hated ""The Angry Birds Movie"". It's truly an awful movie. I really wished somebody at the studio had taken a look at the script and discarded it before the film started production because if they did, it would have been one hundred percent better. If your kids really want to see something related to Angry Birds, just go buy them ""Angry Birds Toons"" and don't waste money on this disaster. It's really not worth watching."
80,The Angry Birds Movie,8,24 September 2016,Quite a surprise.,"I didn't expect a movie to a casual cellphone game to be anywhere as entertaining as it turned out to be. I liked pretty much everything about this movie. Nothing is exceptional, but nothing is disturbing the really nice, comedic flow of the story. The characters are varied and believable within the setting. The dialogues felt natural enough.And i haven't had a problem with the humor, that some people found disgusting. It's only one or two scenes on the level of ""naked gun"", it's a kids movie and kids love disgusting humor. Just get over it. There is still enough slightly more mature lines that made an old, cynical guy like me giggle.So yea, it's a really fun movie. Watch it with bacon & eggs."
81,The Angry Birds Movie,4,7 August 2017,Birds can't fly,"While the movie had some funny lines, it doesn't make up for wasting the time of viewers. Why would anyone let their children see a movie with misinformation of birds that can fly? Anger management is also treated as a joke, which it is not. The creative people lost their common sense in this one."
82,The Angry Birds Movie,6,29 August 2016,I was really expecting to hate it.,"'ANGRY BIRDS': Three Stars (Out of Five)Hit animated kids'flick, based on the immensely popular app video game series. It tells the story of three misfit flightless birds, with anger issues, that must defend their island from mischievous green pig visitors. The film stars the voice talents of Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, Peter Dinklage, Maya Rudolph, Kate McKinnon, Keegan-Michael Key, Tony Hale, Sean Penn and Blake Shelton. It was directed by Clay Kaytis (a veteran animator) and Fergal Reilly (a veteran storyboard artist, of animated films); both in their feature film directorial debuts. It was written by Jon Vitti, Mikael Hed, Mikko Polla and John Cohen (all veterans of animation). The movie was a big hit at the Box Office, and it received mostly positive reviews from fans (but not so much from critics). I liked it.The film takes place on 'Bird Island'; an island inhabited by mostly happy, but flightless, birds. Red (Sudeikis) is a loner bird, with anger issues. After he accidentally causes an egg to hatch early, he's sentenced to anger management classes. There he meets three other bird outcasts; named Chuck (Gad), Bomb (McBride) and Terrence (Penn). Chuck and Bomb try to make friends with Red, but Red refuses. Then a ship arrives, filled with strange green pigs; that claim they just want to be friends. Red is suspicious of their true intentions, right away; and he reluctantly enlists the help of Chuck and Bomb, to figure out what the pigs are really up to. The movie is a lot more entertaining than I thought it would be; I was really expecting to hate it. It's definitely simple, silly and made primarily for kids; but the animation is kind of cool, and it's funny (the voice cast is awesome). I love Sudeikis, Dinklage, McBride, Hader, Gad, Key and the rest; and I think they made the film a lot more enjoyable. It's definitely nothing that special, but it's not bad (or annoying) either.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoRwrYi1UcY"
83,The Angry Birds Movie,7,14 August 2016,What makes the birds to get so angry?,"Video games to films is an old topic to discuss it now, but the fans from the original source are always in the high hope when they hear news like this. Because 'Angry Birds' game is one of the mainstream games which is originally from Finland. Despite the mixed reviews, it is a box office success and definitely a sequel on the card. After lots of animal themed films, now in the line of underrated animation 'Free Birds', another the bird's quest begins with this.I'm not much into this game, but I was looking forward to the film since it was first announced. Now I'm here after the watch and I think is a good film, but better suitable for children than the adults. That did not stop me from enjoying it. The target audience might be the kids with those cute film characters, as well as the story, but there are some dialogues that are written keeping in mind the grownups. Anyway, most of the adults won't feel they are in a wrong cinema hall if they regularly watch animation films, especially in the present world animations are accepted as for all ages.So this is the story about the Red, an orphan bird lives in a small house on the sea shore. The kids from the island loves him, but the adults stay away from him for his bad anger attitude. One day a ship of pigs arrives on the bird's island offering friendship, but their intention was later known once the valuables things were stolen from them. So the revenge and rescue operation begins which stretched with full of action-adventure in the remaining parts.Filled with lots of fun moments, it was much better than I expected. Sometimes it looked cute, but you know our angry bird, Red with his companions makes it not to stay that way. Peter Dinklage as Might Eagle was one of the highlights of the film and the rest of the cast did well too. It is definitely a great directional debute for the two experienced animators. Makes a bit sad how the film was received, but after seeing it myself I think its fine. Different people have different opinion. In my perspective, it was a good watch so I surely suggest it, especially for animation fans and obviously children.7/10"
84,The Angry Birds Movie,6,19 May 2016,Rage-fueled violence is the key to some of your problems,"Set on Bird Island, where flightless multi-coloured birds are perennially friendly and giving out hugs for free, Red (Jason Sudeikis) lives the life of a social outcast for harboring an overwhelming amount of anger. Judge Peckinpah (Keegan-Michael Key) then sends him to anger-management classes under Matilda (Maya Rudolph), and there he meets yellow speedster named Chuck (Josh Gad), a literally explosive budgie named Bomb (Danny McBride), and a grunting giant maroon bird named Terence (Sean Penn). Along then comes a pirate ship of green pigs captained by Leonard (Bill Hader) who introduces them to a ""new technology"". While the other birds welcome their arrival, Red grows suspicious of the pigs' true nefarious intent.Much like the mobile game, though less addictive, The Angry Birds Movie can be entirely summarized as 'colorful angry birds sling-shotting themselves at greedy pigs.' The film's slim plot is brought to life by bloating the movie with ""Looney Tunes""-slapstick humor, bird puns, and a barrage of pop-culture references. While this is never a good sign of assured storytelling, most of the gags are actually hits than misses. Two of the funniest scenes involve Red, Chuck and Bomb's discovery of the Lake of Wisdom and a mama bird regurgitating food into her children's lunch boxes (talk about biological accuracy). The movie is clearly aimed at children, with all the bright colors and its simplistic plot; yet some of its content is actually directed to adults. Take for example the allusions to The Shining and Fifty Shades of Grey', 80's song choices like Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" and Red responding to a bad news with, ""Pluck my life."" (Good luck to all parents on explaining that line.)By the third act, the movie starts to re-enact the game and we witness the angry birds in action, as they whirr their way through the pig town's citadel and blowing stuff in a Rube Goldberg fashion. You will be laughing hard at this point either because a.) these birds really do have bird brains, or b.) reality dawns on you that the film's plot is downright nonsensical. It is hard to take this movie seriously because it is so ridiculous and so unfocusedhaven't I mention a scene where the pigs start singing a Blake Shelton song out of nowhere?On a technical note, the team behind The Angry Birds Movie does an impressive job on the animation, from the feathery texture of the cutesy birds to the vibrant tropical setting. The voice cast willingly throw themselves into the silliness of the script. Jason Sudeikis as Red shines in sarcasm, Josh Gad (whose voice we previously heard as Olaf in Frozen) lends a hyperactive voice to Chuck, Danny Mcbride steps aside from his usual foul-mouthed character and portrays a dim-witted voice in Bomb. Peter Dinklage ironically playing the Mighty Eagle brings a comedic yet majestic voice to his character.While these are welcome compensations, all the sticks come crashing down when the film goes against the virtues that it is fighting for in the beginningempathy and friendship. It imparts a murky message to its young viewers that rage-fueled violence is a key resolution to problems; not exactly a child- friendly thesis as compared to those of the other two animated films earlier released this year: Kung Fu Panda 3 (believing in yourself) and Zootopia (accepting diversity).The Angry Birds Movie lacks genuine inspiration, telling a sagging narrative kept afloat by a steady stream of visual gags and stray media references. ""Anger is weed growing in our garden,"" says Matilda. And just like suppressed anger, I'll have to pluck this movie out of my top recommended animated features.Full review here: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/the-angry-birds-movie"
85,The Angry Birds Movie,4,7 September 2016,I don't think these birds should be 'Angry'.,"The 'Angry Birds' movie is obviously based on the popular app game of the same name. Due to it's enormous popularity, an animated film was inevitable, and here it is.1. On a good note, this film stays true to it's video game origins especially with the character of Red (Jason Sudeikis), who is the 'poster bird' of the game. The animation is pretty impressive as every bird and the pigs are designed very well to their game counterparts. Of course extra features such as wings and legs are added to characters since they appear limbless in the game. The catapult and wrecking aspect is also present when the birds fight back against the pigs, which I think is the most impressive sequence of the film.2. Josh Gad and Danny McBride round out the 'Angry Bird' trio as Chuck and Bomb (respectively). The voice acting is good to where they match their characters perfectly. However, it was surprising to me to see Oscar winner Sean Penn's name in the title, so I was eagerly awaiting to hear his voice, and......I'm still waiting. Apparently the large red bird Terence was voiced by Penn but he never speaks. I assumed Penn would have been the Mighty Eagle, but Peter Dinklage actually voiced that character. This is where the film starts to dip low.3. The biggest flaw about this film is the script writing. Nearly 90% of the lines these characters have are terribly unfunny or just plain bland. This film relies heavily on the physical gags and antics of the characters rather than the dialogue, which isn't right for any film. For a comedy, this just isn't that funny. I barely got any genuine laughs rather than a few chuckles here and there. There are plenty wasted and side characters that fill the void that generally makes the film boring when it really shouldn't. I was hoping things would bounce back, but it never does.This film may appeal to younger audiences, but it doesn't cater for broader groups on an entertaining level. 'Angry Birds' works better as a direct to video/TV movie, and it would be a lot more impressive on that level."
86,The Angry Birds Movie,1,26 June 2016,Voi perkele! What have you done with Angry Birds!!!,"I can't believe it, Rovio, really? You believe Americans can do finnish job better than finns? I watched the movie despite I sworn I will not. I support Angry Birds from very beginning and have my obsession by Finland and most of its games and movies. And what am I seeing? You sold it to Americans! You betrayed your fans, people who pay your damn salary! How could you!?! First, graphics were terrible, I love original birds, Red look like a potato! You've changed everything, you named them with English names, why!?! Their shape was stupid, their voice were stupid, and Red isn't mad because he is alone, he is alone because he is mad! Jesus Christ, I can't believe you ruined it that way, I loved that story, I even have the plushies... You disappointed me very bad, you lost me here! Oink!"
87,The Angry Birds Movie,6,19 May 2016,An O.K. Film with Notable Changes to Source Material,"I have been a fan of Angry Birds since I got to play the demo on Windows Phone five years ago and, switching to Android, and Facebook gaming, I'd played many of their games... and got upset with ""Angry Birds Stella"" feeling abandoned, and ""Angry Birds 2"" feeling like a stretched-out King game. Regardless, I still like the birds, the pigs, and the whole premise of the birds saving three eggs... while giving pigs some black eyes.Yes, three eggs. The original concept is that Red (the main character) is a father, and he and his friends don't take kindly the idea of King Pig and his subjects egg-napping the would-be hatchlings. This exact premise is also closely followed in the cartoon show, ""Angry Birds Toons"". Watching the movie, however, they changed a lot of details from the source material, even giving the characters limbs.When I heard of the announcements for both the cartoon show and movie, I thought that the game's plot would work well as a cartoon show, or, in this case, a web show, but I had always doubt if it'd translate well as a movie, since the birds barely talked. No wonder they changed a lot of things.I'll talk about the movie in both fields: the nature of it as a standalone film, and its relationship with the source material.As its own movie, I can honestly say that its intended targets are kids. The animation style, the movie's version of the story, the jokes, the body languages, they can actually make someone smile, or even laugh out loud. This works more so with kids.The plot's simple to follow, with things getting crazy in Sony's typical fashion in the climax. The story's that Red got himself into trouble with his anger issues, and got sent to anger management. There, he meets the other birds in the game: Matilda (the teacher), and Chuck, Bomb, and Terrance (fellow students). (If you weren't distracted, you'd notice Stella, Bubble, and Hal in the background as well.) While Red was sort of socializing, and beating up Chuck's sign, as opposed to learning to not be angry, King Pig launches a Trojan Horse-like campaign by making friends with the other birds, while having his subjects steal all the town's eggs by the last minute. Since Red never trusted the pigs, and even tried to consult Mighty Eagle... and failed, the town tasked him, and volunteering ""angry birds"", to get the eggs back. And that's where you'd see a not-so-familiar version of the Angry Birds gameplay unfolding in the climax.Honestly, the story wasn't too special, but the ending seems cool for Red and his friends. The jokes and gags also help add some life to it, even supporting characters like the mime, the hugger, and even the Blues and their parents that get Red and the audiences' attentions. I only wished the Blues were in the film, fighting the pigs, instead of giving us a tease of a movie sequel. Terrance even broke the slingshot before we could see the game-like damages he can do. Chef Pig, Foreman Pig, and Corporal Pig (who seemed to be absent) weren't given enough spotlights to shine, while the whole fighting the pigs came, and ended, suddenly. And why couldn't they use the same intro to Red's character like they did in the advert? The film's actual intro was confusing, since they switched back and forth in Red's life.Another complaint I have's that, if you blink, you could end up missing the main characters of ""Angry Birds Stella"" who aren't Stella. It doesn't help giving them limbs to the point that I couldn't tell who was who at first.But, how does the movie stand by its source material? Well, only by half. Again, the victims of the egg-napping are Red and his friends, not everyone else, and they were only three eggs. To make the concept movie-worthy, they changed a lot of things till the premise felt unfamiliar (Matilda even now ""shoots fireworks out of her butt"", as opposed to eggs), even by adding new supporting characters not seen in the games. But, slingshoting birds at the pigs and objects stayed true, even though they weren't Foreman Pig's obstacles, but a whole city, and random birds were shot too. Even Mighty Eagle shows up as the birds' much-needed help, like in the games to some gamers, but they did leave out the iconic sardine cans.You just have to watch the movie to tell if you'd like it, or not, or maybe just find it O.K. But, ideally, Sony and Rovio seemed to have made this film for younger audience who don't necessarily ask for anything complicated. Just stick to watching ""Captain America: Civil War"" if you're in the older demographic.As for Nintendo, it's probably best they don't talk to Sony in making a Mario movie. Looking at Disney XD, and ""Wreck-it Ralph"", they should hire Disney instead."
88,The Angry Birds Movie,6,14 May 2016,Kids night out movie,"This movie is years late, does anyone play angry birds nowadays? Will even for those that were too young to catch this game (do you feel old reading that line?) Then know that the movie doesn't require that knowledge.Storyline is simple, The Pigs are bad.... well that's it really.There is some impressive CGI in this movie, the Water looks gorgeous and the sky very scenic. sadly the characters themselves are underwhelming considering the the two animated movies that came out before it this year (kung-fu panda and Zootopia). It might have been more impressive if it didn't have to measure up to those two.The Movie is clearly aimed at children with bright colours and simplistic plot, there are a few nods to the parents though like a fifty shades of ""green"" book hidden in the pig's ship as well as a (The Shinning) reference later. One thing I did enjoy in this movie was the music which I feel was also aimed at adults (behind blue eyes, never going to give you up, survive) but you can't credit the movie for getting the rights to them. If you have kids then treat them to a fun an harmless movie, the little nods in there will keep you entertained. If you don't and you're above the age of 12 then skip it. a solid OK movie (6/10)"
89,The Angry Birds Movie,2,15 August 2016,Just Not Good,"I never know how to start these reviews so... I really gotta give the movie credit in a few areas. The animation, for example was pretty OK, I mean, nothing special, but I do appreciate the way they modified the birds from the game into the birds from the the film. And the voice actors did a pretty good job considering it was for this worthless piece of... media...But other than that it was just bland, unoriginal, and even... disturbing. The characters had to be of course bland as possible so that all the energy could be focused onto the...ugh... ""humor"" So we have Red, the main character, who's not really an angry bird, but more of a ""constantly slightly ticked off bird"" he's just bothered by the fact that everyone around him is happy and that's it. That's as far as his character traits go. Seriously. Then there's Chuck... He's the yellow one. His main character trait is that he's annoying as hell. His secondary trait is that he's fast. And his tertiary trait is that he's a sex obsessed deviant. Yup. You read that right, but more on that later. Then there's Bomb, he's just the dumb one. That's literally it.There's Leonard who's the villain and he likes country music, so of course I hate him plenty. There are other characters that don't matter like, President Bird Guy, Female Anger Management Bird, etc etc etc The plot is extremely straight forward. The second the protagonists show up and take interest in the eggs, it is so obvious what's going to happen.The ""plot"" is that everyone hates Red because he's mad. So he goes to anger management class and meets the other ""characters"". Then stuff happens. Then The Pigs show up. They do a horrible country music dance thing were they show their asses and try and act all sexy. It's gross, especially since it's paired with country music. Red is suspicious because he sees the pigs taking interest in the eggs and tells his friends who decide to seek out Red's childhood hero, The Mighty Eagle. Now this really ticked me off but when they get to his lair or whatever, Chuck and Bomb go play in this ""Magical Pond"" which turns out to be a pool of The Mighty Eagle's urine. In the next minute and a half, The Mighty Eagle pees into the pool. And that's the joke. Now hold on, not only is that terrible toilet humor and not funny at all, but I had a strange feeling of deja vu while watching this scene. And then it hit me. Where I'd seen it before... Norm of the North. Yes, Norm of the North. And however, whereas that joke got a huge scolding from the audience and critics in NOTN for being immature and gross, when they did it in Angry Birds, it got HUGE laughs and praise. And that disgusted me. I mean, the joke was HORRENDOUS in both movies, but why is one praised and the other scorned? Anyways, The Mighty Eagle is self obsessed and also a pretty huge sexual deviant as well. He doesn't even help them until later on in the filmSo, the other bird finally find out the Pig's plot but it's too late and they already took their eggs. This is when Chuck starts humping the air. He says something about just repopulating and letting the eggs go. And again, if this were in a lower quality animated movie, it would have been scolded. I don't understand that logic? Like, a bad joke is a bad joke. The animation is a small part of it. I've seen plenty of movies with shitty animation that were still good. Or at least able to construct a joke that didn't revolve around sex or toilet humor. So then they go to pig island or whatever and they all suddenly believe and love Red. Which after everyone hated him for the entire first 3/4 of the movie totally makes sense right? Then all suddenly discover they have magical powers or something and the pigs lose the battle (surprise) and they get the eggs back and everyone suddenly loves Red. The End. So yeah, I hated it."
90,The Angry Birds Movie,3,29 July 2016,I did not enjoy it...,"There are animated movies/shows that address adults (like Rick and Morty), there are some that address young and old alike (Zootopia for example) - and there are some that address primarily young audiences. Angry Birds is - in my opinion - addressing only the young. The story was kind of flat, the style and quality was not much better than an average computer game cut-scene and the jokes were mostly greeted with silence in the theater.But i will not blame the movie for it (too much). The source material is a mobile game without something resembling much of a story. The characters from the game are meant to usually possess one characteristic ... and that is it. So - considering the source material - the movie did pretty well indeed..compared to other movies however - it was rather boring.But like i said - maybe a younger audience or people who actually kind of love the game might enjoy it.postscript:I caught myself thinking many times during the movie - and afterwards... ""why did i chose to see it?! - I do not even like the game..."""
91,The Angry Birds Movie,1,18 September 2016,"Angry Birds Movie is a filthy movie that masquerades as family entertainment, with risqué humor & overall lameness","(As sent to my brother-in-law by e-mail, warning him to consider banning this movie for queueing as selection for his young children.)I just rented The Angry Birds Movie on Blu-ray at Redbox, and I found it to be appalling and terrible. I'll explain why you should NEVER show it to your developing children.It's one of the most irritating animated movies I've had a misfortune to have seen, and I did not finish watching The Lego Movie which I turned off when it was only about 20 minutes. I hated that movie that grated on my nerve.The one common thing Angry birds movie and Lego movie share is that it's nauseatingly nonsensical, inane, and frenetically paced that doesn't know when to pause for quiet reflection.Another common thing both movies share is awful forced humor, and what made Angry Birds worse is that it's atypically crude for a PG rating, with this movie being advertised as a ""family"" movie when that should be the opposite in deceitful advertising.The Angry Birds movie contain profanity and risqué humor, with the former ""cleverly"" (according to the idiotic producers' belief) disguised with double entendres such as substitute for the F-word, at least twice. This movie doesn't know what it truly wants to be. It's a bizarre and convoluted animated movie, and it's simultaneously irritating, headache-inducing, and morally offensive.I can't see any point of this movie, despite it being a mobile game adaptation. It's a surprise that this movie, despite the mobile game's enormous popularity, is almost a disappointment in domestic box office gross. I can attribute that tepid box office gross to the bad word of mouth that condemned the movie by the appalled parents and annoyed children, who could not understand some inexplicable movie references that only the adults know for sure, and they will, inevitably, ask with confused demeanor, ""what does it mean?""Angry Birds is overall an awful movie, and it's absolutely NOT appropriate for children under 10 at least. It contains a prolonged scene involving the stream of urine that is unnecessary and offensive.This movie, by the way, is so puerile in its juvenile attempt at humor, including lame movie and pop culture references, that it's not funny at all. I never chuckled. It's an endurance test. And I played Angry Birds mobile game only momentarily, and then left unimpressed. Although I admit to buying Angry Birds gummy products in various editions at the neighborhood grocery store to cut out the characters at home.As a parent striving to be good and protective, I suggest instating a ban of Angry Birds movie so that your children should never see this movie until they are teenaged age, at least. It's too dirty for a PG rating, courtesy of the creator studio and the shameless Sony distributor that emphasize vulgarity in children's entertainment that fails to even entertain. They fail with this movie, badly.I'd give it one star. One of the worst movies of this year.The only positive thing to say about the movie is that the CG animation look gorgeous on my Sony HDTV as almost upscaled to 4k. That's all there is to this putrid piece of crap that's only a cash cow for its producers who pushes filth on the children while masquerading as family entertainment.This filthy movie ought to be PG-13. MPAA is moronic with its rating decision yet again, with conflict of interest favoring the big studios with the low bar on appropriating movie rating.If you see the movie with your wife, you will know why I hate this movie and am appalled at its risqué content. Definitely not for kids, either, despite its marketing misnomer claiming family genre. It should be next to adult anime section and 70's R-rated adult animated fare like Fritz the Cat.(* out of 4)"
92,The Angry Birds Movie,10,7 October 2016,This movie was hilarious!!,"Find out why the birds are so angry. When an island populated by happy, flightless birds is visited by mysterious green piggies, it's up to three unlikely outcasts - Red, Chuck and Bomb - to figure out what the pigs are up to. This movie has hands down the best introduction to a character in an animated film for this year, one hell of a goddamn soundtrack and the characters are all pretty cool especially Red his backstory was so touching and funny he got bullied for his eyebrows and he ended up being alone with no friends in his home looking at the sea but everything changed until he met Chuck and Bomb 2 great and funny characters as well and my favorite scene in the film was easily the scene where this bird sneezed upon his pop corn and he wore the bag on his head i laughed so hard and i really wonder why critics hated this film and ended up liking Ghostbusters? Sure the film might have some mature humor but it works because the movie is funny, well written and the characters are awesome and that's why i give Angry Birds: The Movie a 10/10."
93,The Angry Birds Movie,5,23 August 2016,Too Mindless,"Very crude humor throughout the movie. Constant body part jokes, innuendos, along with quite a few instances of pseudo-swearing (flocking, pluck my life) .A few parts were funny, and they did a good job incorporating everything that is the game of Angry Birds, but the writing was subpar, despite a good cast. Very far off as far as finding the happy medium of entertaining to kids and adults while maintaining a classy air about it. Had I known the movie would have been this way I wouldn't have had my 6 year old watch it.Would not recommend to those who are conscientious about what their children watch."
94,The Angry Birds Movie,5,1 August 2016,"It is not so bad, more is well below expectations","My expectations for The Angry Birds Movie was bad , plus the film at least not as bad as people are saying , more is not good, dubbing cast it's good , Jason Sudeikis , Bill Vader , Josh Gad , Sean Penn , Danny McBride and etc. , the animation is funny , plus the pace of the film is bad, takes too long for the fight scenes between pigs and birds are almost an hour of stalling , more for the final battle is really fun , has good jokes , the trail sound is good, if you like the game , your experience with this animation can be even better, the Angry Birds movie is a funny and fun animation, the characters are good fun , more unfortunately the film is full of problems , it takes too long for expected battle Pigs vs birds. Note 5.9"
95,The Angry Birds Movie,8,29 July 2016,Watching birds get angry is a hoot!,"This animated feature is one not to miss. Kids of all ages will laugh and the adults with them almost as much. This one is a laugh-out-load knee slapper! An island residence of very happy, but flightless birds will come under attack by green piggies. Three unlikely birds, Red (Jason Sudeikis), who has an abundance of anger to let out, speed demon Chuck (Josh Gad) and the quick-tempered Bomb (Danny McBride), always considered outsiders, will form a pact to investigate what is behind the surprise visit of these mysterious green pigs.How can watching birds get angry be funny? Watching Red squint those eyebrows and try to stifle his anger is a hoot! And Bomb is so volatile, you don't know what will set him off. Cinematography is stellar and the colors are bright and crisp. A spirited soundtrack includes music by the likes of: Limp Biskit, Black Sabbath, Imagine Dragons, Steve Aoki, Blake Shelton and Demi Lavato.Some very talented voices bring characters to life: Keegan-Michael Key, Kate McKinnon, Peter Dinklage, Tituss Burgess, Billy Eicher, Danielle Brooks, Blake Shelton, Sean Penn, Maya Rudolph and Bill Hader."
96,The Angry Birds Movie,10,19 December 2017,The best movie based on a game!,"Simply the best movie based on a game of all history, great animation, fun and funny story, incredible soundtrack and great characters, Thanks Rovio!"
97,The Angry Birds Movie,2,8 December 2017,A movie based on a time-sucking phone app,"A movie based on a time-sucking phone app. Right there, I knew this film was in trouble and I wasn't disappointed. There is nothing original or endearing about this. Every scene and character has been done better in another movie. Even the visuals were dated. And the entire first half dragged on forever. Not worth the time."
98,The Angry Birds Movie,8,5 December 2017,Something isn't kosher with the pigs,"Red attends anger management classes and meets other angry birds. Pigs come to island and steal eggs to make an omelet on their island. Only Red can save the day.The film used slapstick humor for the kids and an occasional scene that adults can enjoy such as ""The Shining"" pig twins. I haven't heard ""egg-cellent"" since Vincent Price spoke those words on ""Batman."" The film is light on heavy themes and saved money by avoiding high priced stars for the voices. Red was easy to identify with, but the rest of the birds were a bit shallow in character, but hey, it is just a movie for kids. Hatching eggs uses phrases similar to child birth for humor. Might want to wait for an inexpensive rental.Guide: Bird standing and urinating like a man. Uses phrases like ""Pluck my life"" and ""Flocking birds."""
99,The Angry Birds Movie,1,1 December 2017,Complete garbage.,"I have no words. WHY would you make a movie based on a DEAD app game which wasn't even good in the first place? It's nothing more than high-budget manure. I went to see it in late '16 with some friends, and even though I thought it'd be rubbish I was willing to give it a go. How bad was it? Much, much worse than I thought. Sony can do way better, I mean, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was really good, and now they're making tripe like this and the Emoji Movie. It was unoriginal as hell, the acting was rubbish, and the attempts at humour were sickening. The puns were cheesier than a quattro-formaggio pizza, and the ""adult humour"" goes way too far for little kids.Worse still, absolutely none of the characters were likable. Red is pretty much your textbook protagonist; a misunderstood guy who's isolated from the rest of society. Perfect! Chuck is the most annoying thing on earth and I swear he's on crack. Bomb is pretty much the most normal character in the whole thing, and when you think about it, that's far from normal... Leonard, the villain, is fat as hell and likes COUNTRY music. He's a VILLAIN, for god's sake. What villains like COUNTRY MUSIC?!Terrible, terrible film. I think watching a beetle die would be more entertaining. My mum and 9 year old sister even thought it was trash.Don't get this on DVD (unless you like the game or cheesy puns), ever!Dialogue and Acting: 3/10 Animation: 6/10 Structuring: 2/10 Subtlety and Themes: 3/10 Originality: 1/10Total: 15/50"
100,The Angry Birds Movie,10,13 November 2017,Hey-you-hoo!,"The film is ""somewhat"" based on the ""Angry Birds"" game. The elements are all there, the non-flying birds, which become angry at a certain point, the green pigs that love eggs for meal, some gadgets and even the arcade era nostalgia. Fortunately, it doesn't try to follow the original game's story line, what would be amazingly boring, for sure. Instead, the film follows one of the game's characters' daily life, Red.There are three main acts, the first being the story of Red's life and why he has anger issues, the second tells the story of the pigs' plot to steal the birds' eggs, and the third is the rescue and escape from the pigs' island. There are some intermissions, like the anger management class and the quest for Mighty Eagle. The film loses some comic momentum on the third act, replacing it with more action, but it's still very funny.Although it's a computer animated cartoon, it's definitely not a safe Disney-like feature. It contains all sort of jokes, from childish (e.g., Red smashing the cake) to adult ones, including some scatology (e.g., Chuck dropping ice cream on the policeman and Mighty Eagle ""soiling"" the sacred lake). Everything is taken lightly, though, so even the more adult-oriented jokes are played on the safe zone (arguably, some people are more easily offended than others, but then again, they should just stay away from anything not Disney-ish). In a scale of zero to five, being zero ""Finding Nemo"" and five, ""Sausage Party"", ""The Angry Birds Movie"" is somewhere in between two and three, meaning there are some ""suggestive"" jokes, but absolutely nothing explicit. That said, it's noteworthy that there are no swearing, not a single bad word anywhere, thanks to the clever scripting and intelligent dialogues, and violence is at a ""Tom and Jerry"" level, so when TNT goes off, the most that happens is people getting sooth on their faces.If you have never played or, at least, seen the ""Angry Birds"" game, you may miss a few jokes. If you are still a child, you may miss some other jokes, too. Even so, there is so much fun packed in this film that it's a guaranteed fun ride. Warning, if you were born on the last half of the 20th century, you may laugh your lungs out watching this!"
101,The Angry Birds Movie,5,31 May 2016,"Pluck the Life! I would rather play the game, than watch this movie, again.","Based on the 'Angry Birds' mobile game franchise by Rovio Entertainment. The film from Sony Pictures, was made after the success of the Finnish 2013's 'Angry Birds Toons' series. No longer, told in uttered gibberish, the movie tells the story of Red (Voiced by Jason Sudeikis), a flightless bird, that everybody is mean to, for some odd reason, despite being a member of a happy, yet polite, peaceful society on Bird Island. All of this abuse, has cause him, to carry a bad attitude toward everybody, there which in return, forced him into anger management classes. It is here, where he met a group of misfits such as the fast-talking Chuck (Voiced by Josh Gad), explosive, Bomb (Voiced by Danny McBride), bio-polar, Matilda (Voiced by Maya Rudolph), and silence, but deadly, Terence (Voiced by Sean Penn), who also share, his distrust in orders. There are often seen at outsiders, however, when the island is visited by mysterious green pigs, it's up to these unlikely heroes to figure out what the pigs are up to, before it become too late. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I feel that, although Rovio's series has a popular fan base, it doesn't have, much of a story for a full-length feature film. After all, the overall plot of the game is about a group of angry flightless birds, going all kamikaze, on a lot of badly built, wooden and glass structure, built by green pigs. That said, the story in which director, Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly choose for their directorial debuts was not the best version, this concept could had. Written by 'the Simpsons' writer, Jon Vitti, the kid movie finally tells us, why the birds are so angry at the pigs, but it delivered it, in such a loud, crude, mean spirited and highly inappropriate way that there is no way, other than to describe it as ugly-looking. Don't get me wrong, the CGI anthropomorphic redesign, locations, and the 3D kinda works, but it's seems to me, that the movie was trying to be edgy & cool with its story, that it forgot to add substance. Things are just throw together without much reason or rhythm. Honestly, what does film references like a parody of 1980's 'The Shining' & 2012's 'Magic Mike', has to do with 'Angry Birds' world? What does mature-adult-driven songs like Black Sabbath's 'Paranoid' & KRS One 'Sound of da police', relate to young children? Like really, how many kids below the age of 10, do the writers think, have heard of those references? Also, what is with the film, and all the disturbing sexual innuendoes humor? I get that, it might be jokes for adults, but how many of them, are willing to sit down, and watch 'Angry Birds'. Not that many. After all, only a few members of its 3 billion adult smart phone app users fan base went to see this film, during its run in theaters. That's not a good sign. Its direction is all over the way. The film doesn't know, if it want to appeal to kids or adults I sure that, 8 year olds will surely love, the toilet humor, presented here, but for me, I felt like some of the crude jokes, were too juvenile for my taste. It's weird for me, to say that, because I'm a huge fan of low brow humor, but I think, the low brow jokes needed to be, a little more clever and sophistical for me, to laugh at it. It felt too much of a throw away, here. Another thing, maybe, I'm looking too much, into a kid's movie, but I found the movie disturbing with its hidden anti-immigration xenophobia message. After all, it has an isolationism society lead by a Mighty Eagle (Voiced by Peter Dinklage) who is afraid of foreigner refugees, known to create bombs. Let me know, if anybody else, notice that, besides me, because this movie's story somewhat creeps me out. Its feels like if Donald Trump wrote this. Anyways, this film's message was supposed to be, 'it's okay to be angry sometimes, especially when that anger is put to good use', but that message was never truly explain well. At less, not in the levels of Pixar's 2015's 'Inside Out', levels. It gets somewhat lost in the scuffle. Another thing, I didn't like, about this film is, how annoying, some of the supporting characters, were. The pigs in the film, act too much like the Minions from 2015's 'Minion', with their baby-talk, explosive slapstick and goofy attitude. They were kinda annoying. Despite that, Bill Hader does a good job as their leader, Leonard. Then, there is the bird characters. I don't get why some of the birds characters act really mean-spirited for no good reason, despite being a society of good nature birds. Like honestly, why does everybody treat Red, so badly? If anything, everything that Red does, to the other members of the nest, is somewhat justified. However, the worst character in the film, for me, has to be, Chuck. He was a little too loud and annoying with his in your face style of talk. Despite that, everybody else in the bird's roles, did alright, although, the movie pacing is too slow. It takes forever, for the story to get going. It is way too padded out with Family Guy's style's 'flashbacks' and cut scenes. For me, the best part of the film for me is the climax, where the game part of the source material is honestly used. It was a great action scene. However, the dance ending, post-credit sequence is way too clichés. Overall: When it comes to video game movie adaptations, 'Angry Birds' is probably, not the worst movie on the list. Yet, it's nowhere near as the best movie out there. I have to say, this film really had some potential for greatness, but sadly, it felt like a low brow product placement manufactured cash grab. I can't recommended watching at all."
102,The Angry Birds Movie,6,21 May 2016,It's more for kids! but some older ones will appreciate it!,"I saw the movie over the past weekend. Was it great? No. But sure is at least something,its great entertainment for the kids. I have played the game couple of times but that was quite some time ago and i think the whole angry birds thing has lost its point so the studios decided to create a movie and make the world remember again the game somehow. This movie is not as terrible as I was expecting, sure it had a clichéd story, predicable turns of events, some really missed match songs and some pretty unfunny jokes but besides that The animation is terrific, they got some talented people to act in it, and they managed to get the gameplay involved in a pretty clever way. It's a lot better than it should be. It also had some funny parts throughout but not so memorable ones. i think that The Angry Birds Movie is probably better than it has the right to be because I didn't go into this movie with very high expectations but it was actually decent. It's not perfect, but it doesn't needs to. It's not original, but you have a lot of fun. If you just wanna have fun or you only want a OK movie, this is passable."
103,The Angry Birds Movie,6,17 May 2016,A fun animated film,"When Finland based Rovio Entertainment, the group behind the Angry Birds videogames, announced a film adaptation of its headline series it probably made sense at the time. Angry Birds had become a cultural flashpoint of the mobile gaming industry and following the successful development of a cartoon show based on the rage fuelled birds their decision to take a leap into the cinematic arena seemed plausible when you consider the incredible success of titles such as The Lego Movie. However since work on the film had begun the popularity of Angry Birds has declined resulting in Rovio Entertainment laying-off (no bird- based pun intended) forty percent of its employees. Interestingly this venture to further illustrate the multi-media potential of the Angry Bird franchise may now be saddled with the responsibility of saving it. Having invested at least $80 million in producing the film, and another $100 million in marketing, it is by far the most expensive Finnish film ever produced and a box office bomb could lead to the capitulation of the entire company.Red (Jason Sudeikis) is a bird with an anger issue. Following yet another rage-fuelled incident he is sentenced to undertake an anger management class ran by Matilda (Maya Rudolph). At first Red doesn't get along with the other members of the class which include the Speedy Chuck (Josh Gad), Self-conscious Bomb (Danny McBride) and terrifyingly huge Terrence (Sean Penn). However when some pigs arrive on the Island, led by Leonard (Bill Hader), Red believes they are up to no good and with the help of his fellow birds attempts to find out what the pigs are after.Angry Birds throws a lot of jokes at you, and their quality is very mixed, from a frankly exhaustive amount of bird and pig based puns (Seriously, if you enjoy poultry based puns you will love this film) to a range of visual and sight gags that some of the younger viewers won't understand, and some of the older viewers won't find amusing. Having said that there are plenty of jokes that do hit the mark, and the frenetic pace of the film keeps you engaged with the action. Sudeikis is charming enough as Red to be likable and is ably supported through the incessant energy of Gad and the, surprisingly lovable, Danny McBride. The story is kept very simple, and moves along with such speed that it never really allows any of the emotional moments the film does have time to breathe. Therefore Angry Birds does not offer as much pathos as films like Zootropolis, or the best work of Pixar, or even The Lego Movie but is still serviceable enough as an entertaining experience. Sony Pictures Imageworks have done a great job animating the film with a lush colourful atmosphere and nicely designed characters even if the world in which they inhabit seems a big rigid.Overall I feel this is a pleasantly engaging movie with enough comic weight to yield a few laughs from even the staunchest objectors. Though not a masterpiece, or close to overcoming the better animated features of recent years, it is certainly not the cringe inducing film some had expected it to be when it was first announced. In fact, with little true competition, Angry Birds may be the best video game to film adaptation of all time, though with Warcraft and Assassins Creed out later this year it may not hold the title for long.For more reviews check out my site thebeestheysting.wordpress.com"
104,The Angry Birds Movie,6,14 May 2016,Avian Absurdities,"Angry Birds is a video game franchise created by Finnish company Rovio Entertainment, It was first released in December 2009. By July 2015, the series' various games in all its different formats have been downloaded over three billion times the world over. It was not a big wonder that a film would eventually be made from the characters of this game.Practically everyone has seen at least the original game with the five birds: main bird Red, yellow bird Chuck, black bird Bomb, white bird Matilda, and triple Blues. Many should be familiar with the maddening physics-laced puzzle game play of launching these angry birds to hit the green pigs hiding under various structures. Not too good with analyzing projectile motion, I admit I was not so patient with this game.The film's storyline tells of Red as a miserable hotheaded outcast with poor people skills. A violent altercation with another bird caused him to be sentenced to attend Anger Management classes under Matilda. There, he met Chuck and Bomb, as well as quiet giant maroon bird named Terence. One day, a ship of green pigs landed on the birds' island. While the other birds welcomed their unusual guests, Red remained suspicious that the Pigs were up to no good. Unfortunately, Red's worst fears were soon confirmed, and birds have to go beyond themselves to get their precious treasures back.The film as a whole was better than what the trailer showed. For the most part, the storytelling was very entertaining. The best part of the film was the climactic battle where we saw the birds in action with the giant slingshot, but it was too short, I felt. It was too bad we only saw the green boomerang toucan bird Hal, the tiny orange bird Bubbles and the cute pink bird Stella all too briefly. On the other hand, an inordinately long, occasionally awkward, time was spent with the iconic Mighty Eagle.The voices come from some of the most popular comedians working in Hollywood today. Jason Sudeikis was Red. Danny McBride was Bomb. Maya Rudolph was Matilda. Bill Hader was Leonard. Josh Gad, whom we last heard as Olaf in ""Frozen,"" was Chuck, a hyperactive voice performance I really enjoyed. Peter Dinklage did so well in his ironic casting the Mighty Eagle. It is very surprising that the first time I have seen Sean Penn's name in a film again was as Terence. Fans of the Youtube channel Smosh will be delighted that Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla have cameos here as the voices of Bubbles and Hal respectively.The comedy was rather weird to describe. The jokes can really be juvenile, shallow and silly, but there were also quite a number of adult humor (some even creepy or uncomfortable references). I liked the obvious parody of the ""Time in a Bottle"" scene from ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" or that Grady twins reference from ""The Shining."" I liked the cheery and cheesy retro pop songs in the soundtrack, from ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" to ""I Will Survive"", to accompany the most unexpected scenes. I had fun watching it for sure, but I cannot say I completely liked this film. It was really had to put a finger on what exactly the film lacked, but my kids and I all felt it while watching. Looking back now, I think it may have been this odd sense of humor, which felt forced and flat at times. Anyhow, the small kids in the theater were giggling and laughing so much at the cute green pigs and wide- eyed hatchlings, I enjoyed hearing their delighted reactions. I guess then that the film did hit their target and that is most important. 6/10."
105,The Angry Birds Movie,6,30 May 2016,It sticks to the story,"There isn't many surprises to what is going to happen here, it sticks to the story of the pigs cheating the birds and the birds getting angry about it, hence Angry Birds the movie :)But even though we all know what will happen, it still has a very good introduction to the characters, or at least Red who is the main man here, but it would have been nice to get the intro to all the characters.Why is Terence so big and seems grumpy on the outside, but soft on the inside, why does Bomb really blow up some times, whats up with the crazy therapist and so on and so forth.Maybe we will know more in more films, but it will be hard continuing the story, maybe if they made prequels explaining the birds and their behavior and personality and so on, but yeah we will have to see what they figure out.Location, seating & time: Nordisk Film Taastrup, Taastrup, Denmark - Bio 3, row 9 seat 1, 2, 3 & 5 and row 11 seat 1 & 3 - 29.05.2016 at 14.30"
106,The Angry Birds Movie,1,20 August 2016,Terribly movie!!!!!,"I'm not sure where all the good reviews are coming from.....because this movie was anything BUT good. Actually it was horribly boring and painful to sit through, and was seemingly missing that ""good message"" I read people post.I've played the Angry Bird games for years and when I heard they were making a movie off of the games I questioned what reasonable story line could they even come up with that would ever be worthy of a 90 minute movie. I mean how much depth is in a game where a few different types of birds are launched at various structures from a large slingshot in attempt to destroy everything and the pigs within? Well.....I guess I wasn't too far off in my doubting as there is no story to be found in this Hollywood masterpiece.Instead what we sat through was a painstakingly weak cartoon where the entire hour and a half was full of worthless fillers and stupid plot holes. And to add insult to the ""kid"" movie idea and so called ""good message"", the film was also chalked full of inappropriate scenes and sexual innuendos totally geared for adults. I guess the writers apparently forgot or didn't care that there's going to be kids watching this PG rated movie along with their parents. If its not for kids then try upping the rating next time and not so many parents will be caught off guard.But I'm sure with all the people who are seemingly satisfied with more cinema garbage illuminating the silver screen, we're certain to see Angry Birds 2 come out in about six months with the odds of it being as equally good. Hollywood writers and producers are no longer about making quality movies but would rather crank out volumes of worthlessness junk, throw in some big name actors, and captivate on all the merchandising products instead."
107,The Angry Birds Movie,4,17 July 2016,Bordering on acceptable,"Today's children's movies have been mostly garbage for decades. However, there have been some filled with heart and really intelligent, non preachy story telling. I consider Jungle Book, BFG, big Hero 6 and Zootopia to be some examples of intelligent dramas for kids. However, this movie doesn't make the grade. It even lacks the charm that lowbrow movies like Free Birds had. The story follows red. He's your typical 1 dimensional accidental hero. He finds some misfits and they go on a journey together. You meet the pigs (1 dimensional villains) and everything gets stitched up lickety-split. Nobody stood out in this movie. There were plenty of funny one liners, but you don't care about any of the characters. In some ways, it's like watching a game. Nice visuals, nice tune, scripted plot with no surprises and nothing intelligent to say. Female characters are not portrayed well (although the therapist had some good flaws and I respected how she lost her cool, which is rare for female characters - kudos to the writers for thinking outside the box of the last 20 years on that one aspect). If you don't like sexism, you will be peeved that the female characters have no personality and contribute nothing to the solution. But, as most movies suffer from the opposite problem (girl power), it's shaking things up and failing at doing so. If the kids are desperate, take them to see this. If you want something more intelligent or more sincere, look elsewhere."
108,The Angry Birds Movie,2,1 October 2016,Just not very good,"I have been a fan of the Angry Birds mobile games since the beginning. I didn't hear or see much about this film before release. When i did hear about it, it didn't really excite me, my gut instinct led me to believe it was a 'cash-in' exercise. I was on a long haul flight recently and saw Angry Birds on the movie list. I do love a good animated movie so with 12hrs to kill, I thought I would give it a go. I wish I had not bothered, the movie was awful. So bad in fact I turned it off after about 45mins. As I feared its a complete cash in exercise. The first, and most crucial problem is none of the characters are likable. The main character specifically is awful, he is just not a character with any nice traits. They try to make him cheeky and wise cracking, but he just comes across as a jerk. The story line is not existent and feels completely forced. Its all over the place and has no logic. I kept asking myself 'what is happening here?' Another miss is the concept of why the birds are 'angry' in the movie, it just does not work. This is a kids movie with birds in 'anger management'. It feels like Rovio said 'hey lets cash in on our mobile game and make a movie and shoe horn it around our game'. Rather than having a good story first. You can feel this all the way through the movie. I also thought the humour was way off, its just not remotely funny. What your Toy Stories and Wall-es do is make a movie that kids will love, but also a movie that people of all ages can enjoy because of the humour. Children may very well like this movie but I cannot imagine anyone else will.More recently Rovio have changed the style of their mobile games, moving towards games that are about making money, all about in game purchases. This is really sad and shows that the dollar is king. This movie is further embodiment of that ethos. In my opinion they didn't start out with a good story idea, they started out with the idea to make money out of a movie. And they just got it all wrong. Top animated movies should always have a good story, endearing characters and good humour. This movie has none of those traits. It is not very good"
109,The Angry Birds Movie,6,28 July 2016,It was good tho,"(I'm not a English speaker, sorry for my English) This movie personally I seemed very good, I watch it with low expectations, maybe for that reason it seemed good, because my expectation was so low that it overreached, but still I like it so much, as well I was afraid for being a adaptation of a video game, but not was that bad.The story was simple, there are three main characters, Red which have serious problems of angry, Chuck, He go so fast and is hyperactive, and Bomb, he can blow up when he get angry, they have to join in a great adventure, which I don't want to reveal, enjoy it.I had some problems with the movie, the first one was Red, Like I said he had problems of angry, but in the beginning of the movie he exaggerate so much, he get angry for stupid reasons that make him explode or at least putting faces of angry, but you can see a evolution of this character, thus problems are solved. Other things was the sex jokes, I don't have any problem with this kind of jokes, actually I do them every day, but for being a children's film I think they are so obvious and exaggerated, they don't use word games or things that a simple mind don't understand, but not, it's very obvious and understandable for anyone, but if you don't have a problem with it like me, so we're okay.The film is 3D animated, I'm a huge fan of this, I really love it, therefore not Pixar is my favorite studio, and I feel that this movie did the job, I busied, It made me laugh and it will be interesting watch a sequel, actually in some part I laugh so hard, thing I was expecting because I liked the trailer, but not in this level, especially one character, that when he shows up I knew in the beginning that I'm going to laugh or just smile. On the other hand, the animation was very well done, the trees are incredible, the characters, everything was right, and the artistic design was curious I personally like it, it's very well done, and it's beautiful to watch, especially the water, jeez the water is amazing.The sound stuff I don't want to go deeper because I don't know much about it, but at least the voice acting it feels right, I feel that every voice was good and give more personality to the characters, with the others sounds like sound effects and that things was good too, nothing special but the sufficient for not complain about it.Okay, I think I said everything and we're done, I was thinking that this movie will be very bad, and in the first minutes was it, but in the half and the end it get better, this deserve a recommendation, you should watch it with your family, alone or with friends, for my it's a good movie to watch, enjoy it"
110,The Angry Birds Movie,2,21 May 2016,Adults who are hoping for quality animated entertainment will likely be angry too.,"The characters known as ""Angry Birds"" have become practically inescapable. Created by Finland's Rovio Entertainment in 2009 from just a few conceptual drawings of disagreeable, flightless birds, the video game idea has hatched into over a dozen different versions and spin-offs (often with bad bird puns in their titles), which have descended upon smartphones and computers well over two billion times. Rovio also adapted its Angry Birds games for numerous other gaming platforms which flew off shelves.The Angry Birds have migrated to many other aspects of daily life all around the world. For starters, the birds' porcine enemies were initially chosen as the digital targets for the slingshot-launched birds because of the ""swine flu"" pandemic which was all over the news in 2009-2010. Since then, the Angry Birds franchise has been doing its own influencing  of society and culture practically everywhere. Our flightless feathered friends inspired animated TV shows and a Nat Geo Wild series, print publications that range from science books to cookbooks and a line of fruit-flavored soft drinks from Finland.Images of these birds have landed in advertising campaigns, diverse TV show scripts and in sports venues, as well as on sports equipment, theme park attractions and miscellaneous products worldwide. (You could say that Angry Birds' crap is everywhere.) The Angry Birds symbolism has even nested in the teachings of a Hindu organization in Brazil! (""Angry Birds Yoga""!!) Interestingly, the game that started it all has been accused of being a ""leaky app"" which has allowed American and British national intelligence organizations to siphon off user data (no joke)! But perhaps the most disturbing of all these developments has been the arrival of ""The Angry Birds Movie"" (PG, 1:37) in U.S. and international theaters that are as far flung as a bag of feathers exploding against a brick wall  in high winds.Contrary to the current worldwide reach of their collective wingspans, as the movie opens, the birds are all living on an isolated island  and they're not all that angry. (Well, most of them aren't.) After upsetting the parents who hired him to entertain their little birdie at his Hatch Day Party, a red bird with thick eyebrows who happens to be named Red (and is voiced by SNL's Jason Sudeikis) has a temper tantrum which lands him in court. Judge Peckinpah (Keegan-Michael Key) orders Red to attend an anger management class. The class is taught by Matilda (Maya Rudolph), a hippie-like recovering angry bird. The other attendees are a hyperactive yellow bird named Chuck (Josh Gad), a large but gentle blackbird named Bomb (Danny McBride), who ""explodes"" when he is shocked or upset, and an even larger red bird-of-few words who is called Terrence (Sean Penn). Of course, Red brings his bad attitude to class and we understand why he lives alone, having been ostracized by the other birds.When a ship suddenly arrives at their island's shore and destroys Red's isolated seaside house, making him very well, you know and a green pig disembarks and says that his name is Leonard (Bill Hader) and he's an explorer from another island, Red is suspicious of the pig's intentions but he's the only one. While Leonard throws a big party for the island's inhabitants, Red gets Chuck and Bomb to help him investigate Leonard's ship. Even after the trio discovers dozens of other pigs hiding on the ship, Red is unable to raise any alarm in his avian community. Red then leads Chuck and Bomb up a mountain to find the legendary Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage), the supposed protector of the island. While the guys are busy on the mountain and all the other birds are busy partying, the pigs steal something very valuable to the birds and set sail for home. Now willing to listen to Red, the birds allow him to lead them in a rescue and recovery operation which involves a large slingshot and a lot of pent-up rage. And I'll leave my plot summary at that, for the sake of those not familiar with the video games on which all of this is based.""The Angry Birds Movie"" is a derivative and uninspired film which will mainly (but only marginally) appeal to small children. Written by animation veteran Jon Vitti and directed by Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly (in their directorial debuts), the film stitches together different aspects of the various games along with bits of the live-action films ""Anger Management"", ""Independence Day"" and any of a number of different superhero movies from the past 20 years. According to Wikipedia.com, ""In a March 2011 interview, Rovio's Peter Vesterbacka said, 'you can't take an experience that works in one environment and one ecosystem and force-feed it onto another'."" He was talking about adapting Angry Birds to other gaming platforms, but he might as well have been discussing adapting the franchise to the big screen.""The Angry Birds Movie"" reminds me of the disappointment I felt in watching ""Free Birds"" in 2013. There's more than enough colorful activity to keep the screen bright, but the resulting film is a bit of a mess. The movie does ""connect the dots"" in the ""plot"" of the video games, but still feels unnecessary. The voice acting is good, the CG animation is state-of-the-art, there's plenty of silly slapstick to make the kiddos laugh and some adult-oriented jokes and a soundtrack with songs from the 70s forward to make the adults smile, but the movie is just not all that entertaining. The video games are more fun and much more addictive than this film, which just comes off as an occasionally amusing, but unoriginal money grab. It's enough to make a Movie Fan kind of well, you know. ""C-"""
111,The Angry Birds Movie,5,18 May 2016,It's okay.,"The Angry Birds Movie isn't that bad. The animation itself is OK. I did laugh out loud when the poem written by Bomb rhymed hate with detonate. Instead of simply catapulting myriad puns, bathroom-related jokes and a hodgepodge of soundtrack songs. Instead of elevating the Angry Birds concept to surreal heights of insane genius, the filmmakers settle for a tale bogged down by familiar themes plucked from much better films. The finale results in a free-for-all that basically emulates the actual game in frenetic fashion. But the real assault is the number of lame wordplay gags aimed at the audience. When a fish attaches himself to Red's behind, he issues this insult: ""Bottom feeder."" When an endless line of hatch-lings fill up a crosswalk and block Red's way, his response is, ""Have you ever thought of bird control?"" Then there are the jokes that pop up in passing: A poster for Kevin Bacon in ""Hamlet,"" a book titled ""50 Shades of Green,"" a ham radio, a sign for ""free- rage chicken,"" a pig version of the twin girls from ""The Shining"" and all-too-expected ""Green Ham and Eggs"" reference as well as a side mention of Jon Hamm."
112,The Angry Birds Movie,4,18 July 2016,Unfunny,"I was very skeptical when I saw the trailers and after hearing positive things about the Angry Birds movie, out of curiosity I watch the film on Putlocker. I was disappointed it wasn't as good as some people said it was. At some point I thought to myself was it really a good idea to make a movie about an app nobody talked about in about 4 years. Now don't get me wrong I have played the app and it was fun at the time but the movie lacked all the fun of the app. I found the voice acting insufferable obnoxious. I was amazed at how unbelievably unfunny the film was. The character designs looked horrible and looked nothing like the games. The Mighty Eagle war cry reenactment scene gave me a headache. The part where Mighty Eagle took a whiz in the lake dragged on for 40 seconds. They tried too hard with innuendos and became really desperate. The film was quite racist as they got rid of the pigs for being different to the birds. Well off to see Ratchet & Clank to wash that bitter taste of this awful movie out of my mouth. Who's a pretty stupid film that was just not funny at all."
113,The Angry Birds Movie,3,6 June 2016,Disappointing...,"Not funny at all. Have been playing angry birds for a quite a long time and was eagerly waiting for this movie, but disappointed.Maybe it will be popular among toddlers and kindergarten kids, because they will laugh based on visual and not on the story line and funny moments. Unlike movies like Madagascar, Monsters, Inc.etc. where the movies is great for all age groups, this movie seems unable to deliver that aspect. Some scenes were really predictable where they were trying hard to make a funny scene but rather turns out to be totally amateur story line.Disappointed Disappointed Disappointed......."
114,The Angry Birds Movie,1,9 June 2016,Some very rude adult humor,"I thought this movie would be great for kids, but there were some things the characters said that were very sexual and that kids would definitely repeat. The birds were doing yoga, and one bird asked another ""have you done this before?"" and the other responded ""I usually get paid."" I couldn't believe they were able to say that in a kids movie. Another part that made me upset was when the eggs were stolen, one bird suggested that they just make more eggs and started humping the air. I don't know about you, but I absolutely don't want my kids walking around thrusting. The final piece that really ticked me off and again, I couldn't believe that they could say that in a kids movie was ""pluck my life."" Oh my gosh! I think that one would go over little kids heads, but I think there are a lot of kids that would understand that and start saying it. I just didn't think that the movie taught good things for kids to say. I was shocked at some of the content that was put in the movie."
115,The Angry Birds Movie,4,10 May 2016,It has its moment but falls short,"When this was first announced, I was very skeptical, but the trailers won me over. So when I got the chance to go to a screening of the movie I couldn't pass. I was very excited to see the film but my excitement depleted as the movie went on. The film has its moments but it's bad, as bad as I first thought it would be before the trailers. I had a long nap before watching the movie but I still manage to get some shut-eye for a little chunk of it. I got bored, the funniest scenes were in the trailers, so if you want to see the film avoid the trailers at all cost and you might enjoy the movie a little more than I did. Or go check it out high.By @ericgarcy"
116,The Angry Birds Movie,10,25 April 2017,"Pull back, release!!","It usually goes the other way around, where movies are made into video games. However, despite the rarity of the direction (Let's face it, Mortal Kombat killed the genre......) this is a jewel of a find.It's a fun little romp through the imaginary world of those little bitty birds we spend so much time flinging with our phones and tablets.By the end, you'll feel great and you may even want to fling some more birdies at those dastardly pigs.The best line though is definitely referring to Mathilda shooting 'fireballs out her butt'.....Kids will love it and adults will enjoy it."
117,The Angry Birds Movie,3,20 April 2017,"Weak, and just gets worse the longer it goes on","Red is a bird, a flightless bird on an island of flightless birds. He also has a problem - anger. After an incident at a child's party he is sent to anger management classes. There he meets some interesting characters.Was interesting for about five minutes, and then quickly resorted to cheap jokes and mindless action scenes. Plot is random at best and just gets worse and worse the longer it goes on. I think the writers exhausted any original ideas they had by the 20-minute mark.This makes you wonder who the target audience is. Judging by the weakness of the humour and juvenileness of the script, you'd have to say really young kids. But then there are some jokes and scenes aimed squarely at adults. Or maybe the producers just wanted to cash in on the Angry Birds game, figuring that people who enjoyed the game would watch the movie out of curiosity. Doesn't matter whether the movie is any good, as long as people pay good money to see it...Whatever the reason, this is sloppy, half-baked movie making and does animated movies a massive disservice."
118,The Angry Birds Movie,5,22 March 2017,"A ""new"" movie","I know a lot of people gave this movie many stars. Sorry if I don't follow that trend, and here's why: When you have 2 kids (8 and 6 year old) you watch a lot of animated movies and believe me: after you've seen one you pretty much have seen them all.So, here's my generic review: (Write movie name here) MOVIE REVIEW In this ""new"" movie, (Type studio name) Studios, shows a group of (Vehicles, Animals, Food, Human-like characters) who need to overcome (tragedy, invasion, misfortune).The (brave, valiant, courageous, resolute) main character and his (usually rather dumb) sidekick(s) have to figure out a way to solve their problematic situation and as the plot develops, a significant other will be found. (Which usually happens to a character who had already given up on love).Here comes the spoiler: (Not just for this movie, but for ALL animated movies):At the end, against all odds, the (exhausted, beat, tired) main character is triumphant. (Not that you didn't know from the get-go) The End"
119,The Angry Birds Movie,7,17 March 2017,So much fun,"The Angry Birds movie is so much fun. Of course there are some crude jokes, but that's typical to any kind of movie. I think having an American (I'm assuming) screenwriter affects the movie a lot. It makes it easier to gain a larger audience world wide. I'm astonished by the English-speaking cast. First of all, Jason Sudeikis as the lead, Peter Dinklage as the Mighty Eagle and Sean Penn as the big guy who basically doesn't even say anything? The cast speaks what kind of a big deal this movie was to make.Very funny movie, but of course very typical plot-wise. But that's how it is with most animated mainstream children's movies."
120,The Angry Birds Movie,8,13 February 2017,The Angry Birds Movie Review,"Me and my mom really enjoy the movie and it's very funny as we play Angry Birds game ourselves and its kinda almost exactly like the game, as Terence breaks the slingshot, hopefully he knows how to use it in the next sequel. Can't wait to see the next sequel and I have full of ideas, but it's difficult for me to show them my ideas for the movie. I hope I can see Silver in the next movie and how she deflected to the birds and was raised by pigs. Will Red finally get a love interest. I will think Silver can be voiced by a comedian as she has a very funny sense of humor. Hope there will be improvements for the film series and make it more addicting like the games. Maybe Red should have a love triangle, I'm crazy about love!"
121,The Angry Birds Movie,8,12 February 2017,A great easy watch,"Movies can be put into 2 categories: thought provoking and easy watching. Angry Birds The Movie definitely falls in the latter category..... and there is nothing wrong with that. The colour, slapstick laughs and cute fuzzy looking characters will appeal to the younger audiences but there are plenty of hidden gems in there for us adults too. The hero of the story Red (Jason Sudkis) isn't as multi dimensional as the special effects but he carries the playful story. The graphics are impressive and the story is as good as it can be based on the premise of a mobile app game (one I confess to getting stuck on level 16 of the original). But lets be honest, you aren't going to be watching a movie about a war of flightless birds and green pigs for its twisting narrative. An easy watch for the family and great for a Sunday morning.... although you will never look at crystal clear water the same again :)"
122,The Angry Birds Movie,8,4 February 2017,Feathers of a bird,"It's actually more than one bird. Although if you know the game, you do know the Eagle. But let's leave him out of this for the review (no pun intended). And I have to admit, I was surprised when I watched it. It is pretty coherent, it makes sense, it has a story and it is funny, which is way more than I expected.Am I surprised this is considered for an Oscar? I am a little. But then again I just read a topic by someone comparing the movie to ISIS and Angela Merkel. I almost lost my train of thought, when I just read the subject line. And I was tempted to read the thing, but I reckon I have better things to do with my time. Like write a review about this movie ;o) All kidding aside, this may be predictable, but also a lot of fun. The voice talent at hand is also spot on"
123,The Angry Birds Movie,5,18 January 2017,Not good enough,"I am very sad to say that, but the movie disappointed me musically, graphically and from the story viewpoint. Definitely it didn't meet my expectations, and I think that it was made just for the seek of money. The start was very fading, I was very bored and the voice actor of Red disturbed me. I think that he did not suit to the character at all. Visual shape of birds was very poor. I don't say that I expected the exact copies of original angry birds, but especially the Red and Chuck were very oval to me, too much oval. Despite I loved the choice of Chuck voice actor. After the poor beginning, the movie started to grow up dynamically, yet it lacked humour, or it contained very vast humour. I appreciate the concept of ""anger"" removal, but wasn't being angry the very base of birds? Didn't all birds should supposed to be angry? Not just chuck, red and black bomb one? Honestly, the eagle thing was living the movie a bit, but some inappropriate parts of movie were ruining the so-so way of a movie. Movie didn't have consistent dynamics, it didn't have a positive gradation to me, the start was very vast, strange, lacking humour, then when it started to make sense, yet there were very strange parts, like the creators had some idea, then it got lost, then it came up again, then it got lost and so on. The end, egg salvation, heroism of red somehow made the reputation of the movie better, but it could be done much wiser than it was. Generally speaking, there were parts I enjoyed very much mixed with very stupid or boring parts, which could be substituted with something more witty or logic, or omitted. It could be better. 5/10"
124,The Angry Birds Movie,10,2 January 2017,They stole our eggs,"I would give this movie a ten out of ten simply because it reminds me of my favorite smartphone (more like #dumbphone) game ever, Angry Birds. Such a simply plot, such justified anger. That game was revolutionary.The movie made me laugh. To be honest with you, I watched it on Hulu as amusing background noise while my wife, son, and I went about our business in the house. But we all watched a little bit, we all laughed, and we all agreed it was beyond what we expected for a smartphone game adaptation, which is what this movie is.""Mighty mighty Eagle! Rescue me!""Look at that. The music is so catchy, I started writing along!"
125,The Angry Birds Movie,3,7 December 2016,Awful!!!,"Some spoilers!I can't believe how many are saying this movie was great! It most certainly was not and I am shocked I made it through the movie at all... It was completely rushed and they changed some of the birds beaks around! I mean come on... The birds have had the same look for years and now they change it? I wanted to know more of everyone's background besides it being rather obvious Red was bullied. What about the rest of the crew story? Besides Red, Matilda and Terrance being clearly angry and crazy who else really was? Who was this new King pig? I never saw him in the game... Why couldn't the movie focus on any of the many games? A movie based on Angry Birds Epic would've been awesome! I gave it a 3 because I did laugh a lil, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to adults, but kids may find it amusing because it is bright and colorful lol"
126,The Angry Birds Movie,6,5 December 2016,Better Than Expected,"Find out why the birds are so angry. When an island populated by happy, flightless birds is visited by mysterious green piggies, it's up to three unlikely outcasts - Red, Chuck and Bomb - to figure out what the pigs are up to.So, I had fairly low expectations on this one. Despite a good cast, it is a movie based on a very simple video game. And I thought it tended to bomb at the box office (though when I double-check it seems to have more than made up any losses internationally). But you know what? This is an alright film.Not a great film. Definitely not one of the best cartoons of 2016. But it has its charm (especially Mighty Eagle) and may be enjoyed by both children and adults. Especially if you like seeing cartoon pig butts."
127,The Angry Birds Movie,4,3 December 2016,A few funny moments,"I play the games and saw the cartoons on Netflix. It picked up after the birds went to get the eggs. I chuckled a few times and expected more. it is Angry Birds and they have voices, but it failed. The cartoons are little better and i have a few favorites. After seeing the cartoons and the birds just making noise, the movie was a been there, done that, let's move on. The cartoons put them in various situations while the movie made me feel like i was playing the game. I would rather have noise and facial expressions than actual voices. Expressions can convey a lot more.I liked how they introduced Jay, Jim and Jake, but thought the eggs the birds have in the series should be there also."
128,The Angry Birds Movie,7,29 November 2016,Interesting surprise. Worth a watch for a good giggle.,"I went to this one with really, really low expectation. Yes, I played -some of- the games and, yes, it kept me busy and somehow amused for a few hours. I expected an easy although late cash-in on the angry birds wave since that's what the games made me expect.Well... I have to admit, from the very first minutes, I was astonished to see that they had managed to turn this rather uninteresting story and game to a minimum frame that supported an honest and good story and well put characters. It even made me giggle and laugh a few times! I was never really bored at all. If you're familiar with the games, you'll recognize the various type of birds along with their special abilities which have been turned into a viable part of their characters and the storytelling. There's no abuse on that side, on the contrary. The story itself is in line with the games but much more detailed, not that it would be hard to achieve, but it's presented in a way that makes sense and would certainly be entertaining for anyone even those who don't know anything about that universe.I couldn't find anything really bad to this movie. The voice acting is on par, the animation, the story, the characters, everything is worth any of the animated blockbusters. Their only default really is the reused smartphone game franchise that doesn't make you think this might be worth it. But it is!"
129,The Angry Birds Movie,4,31 October 2016,Rovio is milking the franchise too much,"I remember playing a very addictive physics based game involving flightless birds on a slingshot darting themselves at pigs. The idea was funny and addictive. I played it a lot. Then like other games, I grew bored of it and stopped playing it.Rovio, the maker of the game franchise did not stop at that. They kept bringing a lot of games with little tweaks here and there, but never got me interested again. It was out my initial love for that game, I decided to watch this film.The idea is simple. It is based on how the game plays out. The pigs steal the eggs and the birds get revenge. Making it a scripted animation could not introduce anything new. I was left searching for some common elements from the game. There are plenty of those but nothing that stands out as a unique movie experience.Superhit songs are reprised, nothing new there either. The overall attempt felt average or rather tad bit below average. Recommended only if you are a die-hard fan of the original game. You can skip it otherwise."
130,The Angry Birds Movie,4,28 October 2016,Angry message,"Children will find The Angry Birds Movie entertaining and even subversive enough. They might even get the references to The Shining or singalong to a pop tune from 30 years ago such as Rick Astley's Never going to give you up.Red (Jason Sudeikis) is angry and sent to anger management classes, where he meets the slightly less angry Chuck (Josh Gad) and Bomb (McBride) who are all in therapy.They are interrupted when a pig expedition arrives to the birds' island. Although welcomed by most of the birds, Red is sceptical of these foreign invaders. Red, Chuck, and Bomb look to find the island's Great Eagle to find out what the pigs are up to which seems to be a plot to steal the bird's eggs.I am sure the kids will adore the anti-immigrant message of the film and treat foreigners with suspicion!"
131,The Angry Birds Movie,6,22 October 2016,Fun for the whole family! 6/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this fun and joyful movie, mainly because of the various characters and the way that the director introduced a lot of the concepts of the game, to the big screen. The witty script was a bit corny in places but it's great for a family day out and the vibrant colours and attention to detail was pretty good. The film is based on Red, who is sent to anger management because the head of his village, Judge Peckinpah, thinks that he has severe anger problems. Whilst attending the anger management classes, he meets Chuck, Bomb, and Terence, who all have there own personal issues. When a mysterious ship arrives at there village, a green pig, Leonard, comes ashore and brings joy to the village but Red thinks that he has a hidden agenda, so him and his new friends investigate the unknown newcomers. They then find out that Leonard is no good, so they try and get help from the infamous Mighty Eagle, who has been in hiding for some time. After spending time with Mighty Eagle, they realise that he isn't going to be any help, so Red uses his resources to try and save the village with his crew of misfits. I liked the various references to movies and the whole ""saving the eggs"" element gave the film a meaning. It wasn't in the class of a classic Pixar movie but I did like Chuck and Terence, who was surprisingly voiced by Sean Penn, even though he only mumbled through the whole film. Its definitely one of those films that you have to watch a couple times to get all of the jokes and weird face expressions because there is so much going on at once and the pace is quite fast. Anyway, I thought it was a decent watch, and the bonus material on the DVD was well put together.Round-Up: It always surprises me when I see the budget for these animation movies, because I wonder were all of the money goes! I know that it takes many people to create the characters, which can take years but the amount of money they use is mind blowing. Anyway, this is the first movie directed by Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly. Reilly has done the storyboards for Space Jam, the Iron Giant, Osmosis Jones, Stuart Little 2, The Haunted Mansion, Spiderman 2, The Longest Yard, Open Season, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, the Smurfs and Hotel Transylvania, so he has had a lot of experience in the artistic preparation of movie making. Kaytis has been an animator for Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Mulan, Tarzan, Fantasia, The Emperor's New Groove, Treasure Planet, Chicken Little, Meet The Robinsons, Bolt, Tangled, Wreck-It- Ralph and Frozen, so his impressive experience must have made a big difference to this movie. I'm sure that there is going to be more Angry Birds movies in the future but there is nothing in the pipeline as yet. With Red now leading the village, it will be good to see were they take this franchise, if they decide to bring these characters back to the big screen.Budget: $73million Worldwide Gross: $348millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/action/comedies, voiced by Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Bill Hader, Peter Dinklage, Sean Penn, Keegan-Michael Key and Kate McKinnon. 6/10"
132,The Angry Birds Movie,,8 October 2016,"It is time to get Angry, Birds!","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library.The premise is very simple and straightforward. A group of flightless birds of all kinds, colors, and sizes live on a small island and, as far as they know, their world is the only world. They live happily and without strife and if any of the birds were to get angry it would have to attend anger management classes.The lead character is Jason Sudeikis, who is perfect as the voice of Red. He has little patience with the foibles of others and often gets angry. We see that later this works to the great advantage of the whole bird society.Suddenly and unexpectedly a sailing ship appears and runs aground, in the process damaging Red's house. He isn't happy but, in anger management, does the best he can to overlook it. Off the ship comes two green pigs, saying they are lone explorers, but Red investigates and finds dozens of other green pigs on the boat below deck. The plan was to steal all the unhatched eggs, all their children, and bring them to the piggy island to be used as food.So under the leadership of Red, who encourages all the birds to become ""angry"", build a boat, and go to the piggy island to reclaim their eggs.My two other favorites in this movie are Josh Gad as the small, hyper yellow bird Chuck. Peter Dinklage, the smallest actor here, as the big voice of Mighty Eagle.All silliness of course, but entertaining silliness. Lots of clever and subtle jokes, I was entertained."
133,The Angry Birds Movie,2,12 June 2016,not a good or entertaining movie at all,"I am a big fan of animated moves and i'm a big angry birds game fan, but this movie was beyond being stupid. I've read other reviews raving about the movie and all I can think is that we didn't see the same movie. there were a few funny lines and scenes, mostly in the first 5 minutes, that were cute and funny but if you've seen the trailers, you've seen the best parts of the movie so save your money. 10 minutes in, I was falling asleep. watching the Eagle urinate into the pool is not my idea of entertainment and definitely NOT something I expect to see in a movie where many children will be attending. I sat in a theater pretty full and a mixture of adults and children, there was very little laughter or verbal response to any of the 'humor' so I must not be alone in my dislike. my 6 yr old liked it, the 8 year not much at all."
134,The Angry Birds Movie,5,15 May 2016,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"We were a huge fan of the game ""Angry Birds."" We could play it all day and never get bored. Years later, a movie finally decides to come out.Fans of the computer game will probably admire the way that the film-makers managed to crowbar a narrative into the baffling silliness of this phenomenon. But if you are not a regular player, the story feels like an inelegant and pointless scramble of trampolines, catapults, eggs and anger management classes. Despite the best efforts of Jason Sudeikis, the voice of the central character, Red, who drenches every line with a thick coating of irony, this simply isn't funny enough to charm the parents of the film's intended audience: impressionable and not particularly discerning children.We, for one did not think it was that embarking or charming to watch. It had a few good scenes, but that was it. The characters are all annoying and so over the top that it wasn't funny. It was more embarrassing. And the movie was too childish that I was embarrassed to be in the theater. So it's not even a family movie, it's more of a kids movie. While Goosebumps and The Jungle Book remake both captured the charm and wit and humour to appeal to adults this movie doesn't really succeed in that manner. Take your kids to see it, but don't expect an adult to enjoy it. Autstic Jay: 2/5 stars. Autistic Nick: 3/5 stars."
135,The Angry Birds Movie,3,16 May 2016,Not much fun at all,"Looking at the preview I didn't expect much but after watching the movie - it confirmed what I dreaded - the conversations are dry and character development is horrendous.The story-line is very much predictable and felt forced. Even kids come along with parents in great anticipation that crowd the cinema very soon start to get bored. It try to lived up to the fun, cuteness and cult of the game but seriously the game is so much much more fun and enjoyable.This is a forgettable movie even if anyone intend to passes time decently. Sorry guys but other animation like Big Hero Six, Wreck It Ralph or Jungle Book has set the standard high for animation/cartoons nowadays."
136,The Angry Birds Movie,4,31 May 2016,Somewhere Between Harmlessly Bad and Malignantly Bad,"Films based on video games have come a long way since the late Bob Hoskins first dawned blue denim overalls and plumber hat while on a quest to save the princess. Unabashed video game nerds have had to contend with the ridiculously campy adaptations of the 1990's, the unbearably turgid reworkings of the 2000's and the vacuous renditions on the 2010's; to say nothing of the atrocious low- budget, spazoid tinkerings of Uwe Boll. I have no doubt that one day, one day soon, there will be a good movie based on a video game. Unfortunately The Angry Birds Movie is not that movie.The film centers on a small island community of birds who exist peacefully under the presumed eye of Mighty Eagle (Dinklage) who legend has, can actually fly. The only proud miscreant of the flock is Red (Sudeikis) who due to his latest outburst, is forced into anger management class at Matilda's (Rudolph) angry bird sanctuary. It is there Red meets fellow outcasts Chuck (Gad), Bomb (McBride) and the strong, silent Terence (Penn). Things in the community begin to change for the worse with the arrival of King Leonard (Hader) and the pigs who distract the native birds with useless trinkets while plotting to steal the flocks' eggs.It is abundantly clear from the first half hour that the film doesn't have enough plot to actually fill it's entire hour and a half length. To pad it, the movie inundates the audience with a barrage of dated, low-brow jokes and bird/pig/egg based puns that halt just long enough to bask in assumed chuckles and applause like a sitcom laugh track. The jokes that actually manage to land are ripped whole-cloth from better movies whose writers may have been offended if the movie wasn't so inconsequential.Inconsequential but still hard to digest; especially when sitting in a theater full of families who seem to pay no mind as Angry Birds seems to belay a confusing message. The pigs are portrayed as one- dimensional, easily distracted, bumbling idiots whose singular aim is to steal children. Meanwhile the only bird questioning their motives is the angriest bird in the village who seems less concerned about the village than with his own piece of mind. What is the message here exactly? It's alright to be angry? It's okay to be suspicious and even hostile to outsiders? What outsiders need is a common enemy they can use to be welcomed into their community?As with all movies of this type, throngs of un-invested parents may lob a half-hearted defense of The Angry Birds Movie. It's just a kid's movie after all; why try to analyze and criticize a movie meant for children? They're just here for the pretty colors and physical humor. This argument is as stale as the jokes that plague this movie. Inside Out (2015) is a kid's movie; The Lego Movie (2014) is a kid's movie; The Little Mermaid (1989) is a kid's movie and they still manage to be emotionally complex, legacy making and wildly entertaining films. Perhaps presently children won't internalize messages of being true to yourself, celebrating your uniqueness and aspiring for more. But eventually those children will grow up and model themselves based on, among other things, the media they consumed. Do you want your child to be more like Emmet in The Lego Movie, or Red in The Angry Birds Movie.I was rooting for this movie myself. While video game adaptations have proved a troubled sub-genre with unanimously lackluster results, I still hope for one good flick before the end of the decade. Unfortunately, with bad jokes, boring characters, dubious themes and a generally condescending attitude towards its audience, The Angry Birds Movie tows the line between harmlessly bad and malignantly bad."
137,The Angry Birds Movie,3,15 May 2016,The Angry Birds Movie attempts to capture the magic and excitement of the game. It's just too bad that you have to drudge through a full hour of pee and fart jokes to find it.,"Angry Birds The Movie. Many people might not realize this, but the mobile game did have a plot. Pigs invade the lives of the angry birds, take their eggs, then the birds have to destroy the pigs homes in order to get their precious eggs back. And as thin as that plot already is, the movie was somehow able to stretch it to an hour and a half. They just had to fill it with unnecessary action, unfunny slapstick comedy, and fart jokes.The Good:The characters were each unique and interesting. The voice actors even did a decent job portraying the different characters. I mean they got voice talent from Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, and even Peter Dinklage. Man. For the dialog they were given it was acted well. It's just sad that almost every joke falls flat or ends in a character laughing. When are studios going to learn that just because a character laughs at a joke, doesn't mean it's funny.The animation was also pretty good. They were able to take the characters from the game and put them on the screen in a visually appealing way. It's just too bad that when they finally get to the destroying part, the movie is almost over.The Ehh:I can't tell you how much music there was. And I don't mean film score, I mean licensed music. They had hip-hop, rock, country, disco. I think the covered every single genre. With so much music it felt more like a music video than an attempt at storytelling.The Ugh-ly:It was so slow. Now, don't get me wrong, there are things happening nearly every second if you include fart jokes, bright lights, and zany characters. But the plot takes forever for anything to happen, and even when it does, there is almost no point for it to happen. The only good part of the movie are the last 30 minutes. Everything leading up to the is boring, drawn out, and almost completely pointless.Conclusion:Now, I understand that this movie is for kids and that is probably why I didn't like it. My theater was filled with kids that were laughing and engaged the entire time. That is why minions did so well last year, families with kids kept going to the theater. This movie will probably follow the same path. Large families with children will continually attend and it will probably enjoy a very nice run in the theaters. So that being said, I'm going to enact a dual recommendation. If you have kids that are between 4 and 10, this movie is a definite wait for redbox, but if you have older children, then I'd say don't bother.

138,The Angry Birds Movie,3,22 May 2016,Lame,"Maybe I'm just burned out on kids movies, but it didn't do anything for me. Jokes fell flat, and the attempt to turn cartoon bird projectiles into characters with human like personalities that go to anger management turned me off right away. My 7 year old son loved it though, which pulled it out of the 1 range. To be fair, I didn't go there expecting a masterpiece, and in the end my sons happiness is what matters here. They attempted to do things to keep adults interested, like the soundtrack, some of the questionable references, and an eagle peeing for a full minute and a half, but meh. Wish I could've passed on this one,. Next time I'll try to get one of his friends parents to take him, or bring my sleep mask so I can catch a few z's."
139,The Angry Birds Movie,1,8 June 2016,The curse of the games that become movies continues.,"First of all, let me say the only good thing in this film: stereoscopic effects. Really well done, I must admit. The rest? Pure garbage. Arriving too late to show relevance, because the period of the Angry Birds mania already finished, this film has no originality and its characters are shallow stereotypes, shallower than a saucer. If you are over 5 years old or You has already seen at least 5 animations and anime in your life, then you've seen this film. Starting with the very cliché protagonist hero, Red: a boy who is rejected by his entire community (wow, that original thing, my goodness!) and that is orphaned (Harry Potter, Naruto, Luke Skywalker, Bruce Wayne), and plays the hero who wants to save the society that mistreats and rejects him. Really? Where is the logic in that? No real human being - (read: no believable character) would care to help a group of individuals or a society that only mistreats you. It makes no sense at all. ""Friends"" of the protagonist follow him just as script convenience, nothing more than that, because there is no real reason for them being there. It all sounds forced. Not even funny this film is; the comedy is full of memes we've seen a million times and scatological jokes inappropriate for children. But if the film is too dull for youth and adults and inappropriate for children too, it just shows the lack of focus of this film. A waste of time. The curse of the games that become films continues. Be careful, Assassin's Creed!"
140,The Angry Birds Movie,1,31 May 2016,Another Poorly Done Animated Feature Trying to Ride the Success of Other AF movies,"Script was very weak and predictable. Dialogue was, for the most part, not funny. There were gross and inappropriate parts for children including a very long and inappropriate bathroom scene. I heard even teenagers complaining about how lame that scene was.Honestly, do these films even have an editor to take out the inappropriate and tasteless parts or is that the kind of appeal they are going for?!There was no real acting involved in the movie. It was overly reliant on the animation and action scenes... that were slapped together in a very poorly fitting manner.I guess any kind of garbage that you can slap together and call it an animated feature film will do these days without regards to any quality control standards.I would not recommend this film for families or for anyone over the age of 8 or 9 years old. They spent how much money making this piece of trash?!?!?"
141,The Angry Birds Movie,2,26 May 2016,"Better than average movie, but why do we need gay protagonists?","I try to be open minded when I watch movies, but not when I bring my kids with me. Our family didn't expect comments that a character liked seeing unclothed same-gender animals. We also were surprised that a day dream included alternative lifestyle behavior one might expect in a gay-bar. Unfortunately that is what you get in this movie. Maybe I am just being over-sensitive but I didn't find that humor funny or suitable for a kids movie. If it was just me and my wife, then I would probably not cared. If my children were older (13+), then again, probably not an issue. The rest of this movie didn't need a PG-13 rating, but for that type of exposure I wish it would have."
142,The Angry Birds Movie,6,12 June 2016,Okay,"I remember back literally years ago when I first heard of the Angry Birds movie and may have been my most anticipated movie besides the Star Wars sequels. Why? I honestly think ""Angry Birds"" set a record for most recent franchise to become multimedial, as it came out in 2009. I don't think I have ever played the actual game. You really don't need to, to watch this movie. This was a decent effort, nothing really good or bad. I will say that the animation in this film is great! It's about as fluid as cartoon birds have ever been depicted! It's certainly legions ahead of 90% of video game movies, but it's still not quite good. The plot's pretty basic, with pigs coming claiming to want to be friends but are actually stealing their eggs.The action scenes are pretty well done and it's about as faithful to the game as you could really expect. The flaws are that the story isn't that good. We've seen this story a million times before, with the outcast who desires to become a hero and redeems himself. It falls into the fault of a lot of bad animated movies like toilet humor and random pop culture songs. The urinating part goes on way too long. That being said, the voice actors are quite good in this. There are actually some pretty heartwarming moments in this. The story is fine, it's just nothing that out of the ordinary. It's not the next ""Zootopia"" but thankfully its also not the next ""Doogal"". **1/2"
143,The Angry Birds Movie,,14 May 2016,Wosrt animation movie ever!,"It s a real waste of money, story was boring and INCOMPREHENSIVE... nice animation, nice design...but NO STORY, BORING GAGS, etc... My kids were bored, 4 yo after 10 min and the 6 YO after 30 Min. How is it possible that with so much money no one sees that there is no story, no concept. Having a main character that is all the time ANGRY.....not funny angry, but annoying angry, wining, this doesn't help real. The villain, the pig, is not a real villain...and he never becomes one. As an audience, you don't feel connected, you don't care about the eggs, or about the angry main characters...at the end they ALL TURN OUT TO BE angry birds, so it becomes a complete overdose of Annoying CHaracters. Also at the end they destroy the city of the pigs, it s no fun....it looks a nice city. It s very DESTROYING, like war-destroying wise...there is no peace end, where everyone is happy."
144,The Angry Birds Movie,4,15 May 2016,Not worth my time and money,"First time I get to post a review here, and I did it just because of the need to balance the number of highly positive reviews I've read of this film. I deeply enjoy good animation movies like Inside Out, Zootopia, Kung Fu Panda 1, 2, enjoyed the third but not as much as the previous two and most of Pixar movies. I'm a big fan of the game and my 8 year old kids are too, so after reading a few reviews even though I was never excited about the trailers I decided to give it a try with an open mind and low expectations. My opinion is that I could have waited for it to be released on video. It's a very linear story where you have a character being isolated and bullied for being angry, and ends up being a hero. Voice acting was good, but the jokes are very few in my opinion. The whole audience laughed just once during the whole movie and it had more kids than parents, some of those like myself, fans of the game. I don't mind the movie being ""late"" after the game is not the latest trend anymore as long as it's a mildly entertaining story. In that sense I enjoyed even more Minions and I didn't think it was very good but entertaining enough. I had to take my kid a couple of times to the restroom during the movie and I didn't mind at all for him to take his time and we even passed to buy some more candy, I didn't feel I missed anything important at all of the story when we returned. I asked them after we were out if they liked the movie and their answer was so so.If you're curious, rent it, or wait for it on Netflix, as low your expectations you may have, the movie is even lower than that. I should have known better to trust all those extremely positive reviews and follow my own intuition on this one. Judge by yourself, by all means, but you have been warned."
145,The Angry Birds Movie,1,12 June 2016,NOT for kids!,"I took my 10 year old little brother to see this movie in theaters, and we walked out an hour into it. There is MAJOR innuendo, sexual jokes and references, and some serious moral issues within this movie. Most of this passed over the head of my little brother, but I can't BELIEVE this movie is rated PG! There were multiple sexual jokes made throughout the movie that weren't just borderline-they were crude and explicit. The characters' actions were also extremely suggestive, with one demonstrating the ""Downward Facing Dog"" on screen of a kids movie! Also, each of the characters are dealing with some form of anger management problems, and the movie encourages that. All in all, I was appalled with the amount of sexual innuendo and explicit content of this movie! I would suggest NOT taking your children to go see it!"
146,The Angry Birds Movie,5,26 June 2016,Miss Piggy Wants None of This,"Like the recent Independence Day sequel, this movie was far too late. Angry Birds is certainly cute enough, some of the jokes work pretty well and they really captured (or catapulted?) the game perfectly, but for some reason, it's completely forgettable as soon as the movie ended. In kind of a morbid tale of eating children, Angry Birds tells the story of flightless birds with unique talents and definite personality issues and their neighboring Pigtown and their obsession with omelets.or Hamlets? Huh.The battle begins half-way through when the Minions, er, pigs are successful at stealing all the children, uh, eggs and the underbirds go to save their next generation.Really, it's harmless and fun for the most part. Not the spectacular quality of films from Pixar, but it did its job.Andthe movie did work in the sense that I downloaded ""Angry Birds 2,"" one of the versions I've never played before after getting addicted to the original, Star Wars, Seasons, et al, many years ago. In fact, haven't played the game in probably two years. So, well done, movie version of Angry Birds.Let's just hope there's no Candy Crush Saga Trilogy. Egad. That series would be tough.***Final thoughts: This movie did cram in as many movie references as they could, relevant to the movie or not, and that was all fine and dandy. BUT, I will not tolerate blatant theft. Though it was humorous  and it was  there was a scene that literally ripped off X-Men: Days of Future Past (and possibly, that sequel's sequel, Apocalypse.) It would be one thing if Days of Future Past came out the same summer and the idea crossed paths, but that movie came out 2 years ago, like what this movie should have. So, it's unforgivable."
147,The Angry Birds Movie,3,15 May 2016,Beautiful CGI does NOT make up for the poor story...,"I gotta say one thing, Rovio did a GREAT job animating this movie. The animation is smooth and absolutely breathtaking at times. Bravo, Rovio. I can give you a few points for this.However, then there's the story and then you realize what this movie is based off of. Yeah, it kinda sucks. I won't spoil anything too big, but the film is extremely boring and the plot is simply: misfit bird finds other misfit birds and they team up to defeat an evil green pig who has no development and is simply...evil. This guy was supposed to be like Galaxar from Monsters be Aliens...wants to take over something but is kind of incompetent and is supposed to be funny. I admit, a couple times he can be funny but overall he is very flat and after a while he drove me crazy!Also, they kind of released this movie late. Who do you know has Angry Birds of their phones or tablets? It's in the past like Bitstrips and did not deserve a movie since...well, the game is just bird knocking down green pigs. Yeah. Real-depth story telling going on here!However, I personally think you can make a movie based off of anything. I think Rovio focused too much on the $$$ and the animation instead of the story (kind of like Hayao Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle), which is a total shame. It had some potential.I think Rovio after this should hire better script writers and start making movies instead of games. Seriously...their animation is beautiful. I can imagine themselves teaming up with Pixar or Dreamworks someday.Also, the minion pigs in this movie are obviously Despicable Me Minion wannabes. Sorry Rovio...you didn't hide that too well."
148,The Angry Birds Movie,3,11 May 2016,It Was Okay For A Kid's Film,"So I am going to be straight up honest. I have always loved animation films because they have always made me feel like a kid again. I won't lie, even Winnie the Pooh is also entertaining for me (The original ones). But let me tell you, if you are over around nine years old, just drop off whoever is younger than nine at the theater and do something else then come back and ask the kid about the film. The kid will explain it exactly the way the film is. First the good. I liked that it has a few cool voice actor's. The voices for the film is very well casted. There are also very few funny moments in the film. I also loved how they also stayed true to the app game and yet still at least tried to create a story out of it. I also liked the King Piggie since he was at least trying to be a comedic villain.Now for the bad. It is a childish film. A REALLY childish film. I felt so embarrassed to be in that theater. I was hoping in my mind I could be at least eight years old so I could feel confident to watch it but I had to hide myself from the others the whole time. I mean, kid's would probably get a few jokes in this but as an adult I am pretty sure you will have to ask your kid or younger brother or sister to explain it. Now for my own personal opinion. Like I said, rather take your kid who is younger than nine to see the film and let him/her tell the film to you instead. You could save a lot of money. When it comes out on DVD, rent it on the day you feel you have watched literally every good movie you could think of. I will admit it was better than Alvin and the Chipmunks 4 The Road Chip."
149,The Angry Birds Movie,4,31 May 2016,Not worth $20 for 2 adults and 1 child at the drive-in,"A 7 year-old might laugh at this. But only a few times, my experience was. Ditto, the folks who brought him.Not all modern animated features are living up to the unspoken bargain going on, seemingly since Disney pioneered the genre, that these movies will keep entertained the adults that the kids need to get there.There's a real boring sameness settling in. They all have lots of bright colors and near-constant motion. Voices by 'hip' Saturday Night Live alum. A character who farts a lot, generating the apparent requisite 'rude humor.' Another character who's curmudgeonly but winds up saving everybody.I just wanted our boy to have the experience of going to a drive-in movie. It wasn't a total let-down, but it sure didn't set his imagination - or funny bone - on fire."
150,The Angry Birds Movie,5,19 May 2016,Middle-of-the-road film...no Lion King!  Pre-teens will enjoy it.,"RATING: C+ SEE IT?: Sure....It's an entertaining film that will provide a couple of laughs. As expected, it is geared towards the kiddos; but, is enjoyable for the entire family. Pre-teens and younger will especially enjoy it.This movie was a middle-of-the-road film to me, just OK. Nothing really stood out about it. It was thankfully short - which made it more enjoyable! What can I say, it's no Lion King but will entertain all ages for 1 1/2 hourSEE FULL REVIEW: https://youtu.be/eo62S51e4VU"
151,The Angry Birds Movie,2,8 June 2016,Disappointing,"Before watching, I believed this would be a great movie. After watching, I just wanted to lie down and think of how I just wasted my 97 minutes of my life. Just no! There was hardly any mention or action from the original game 'Angry Birds'. Yeah! Because it is okay to show streams of morning pee and butt slapping. Don't mention Chuck saying something like ""...okay ladies! Time to get it busy!"" While pelvic thrusting the air after the pigs took their eggs. He was acting gay around red? Is this what movies have to be now these days? Butt humor and just stupid jokes no one will ever get? Cmon man! It's 2016, not 2012! I will be sad if they make a PVZ movie..."
152,The Angry Birds Movie,1,25 April 2017,One of the very few movies I click out on,"This summary is not a joke. This movie is honestly terrible.The thing with the Angry Birds Movie which I do not understand at all is that it's supposed to be aimed at a family-friendly audience, however there are jokes galore here that do not fit in that category.Unfunny adult innuendos, twerking, toilet humor. I'm not the kind of person who would even be into this but I was genuinely disgusted about how crude this movie is.And also, instead of the movie being dragged on and long just like any other simple story being adapted to the big screen, the movie goes way too fast. I couldn't keep up with what was going on. Even in places where it seems normal it doesn't ever stop for a second. There was an interesting premise to this movie but it just didn't catch on to me because of the humor and how fast the movie goes. And I had to click off after watching for a while because I couldn't take it. I almost had an aneurysm."
153,The Angry Birds Movie,4,12 May 2016,Too late,"This film was delayed more than five years Could have been a sensation if he offered five years ago is happening But .. very bad An hour and a half of my life will not returnIt can be fun for children .. Lengthy scenario Story weak Beginning the film, which is planning the second part But I would feel sad for those who will be forced to watch it with their children. The director of marginalizing many prominent figures Some key figures and did not involve Finally It was not fun was not funny. I was hoping the film talks about the biggest Mobile Games to be a wonderful story But what's just a name from under the names of the films that will be forgotten by history"
154,The Angry Birds Movie,5,2 June 2016,OK let's get real here.  This movie does no justice at all to the original game.,"So yeah I saw this movie and I was expecting to hate this movie. But I was wrong. I only mildly think this movie is adequate. So let's get down to business. Yeah this movie most definitely gonna make a lot of money. A lot. It is aimed towards kids and kids just love the Angry Birds games because there is like a million of them now. This movie is about the red bird. He has anger issues. None of the other birds like him, he gets on people's nerves and he isn't very social. When pigs come to their island, he is the only one to think that they are up to something and he ends up being right because the pigs steal the eggs. Angry Birds. Did you notice how only two of the sentences I said related to the actual Angry Birds game? How the red bird is angry, and how the pigs steal the eggs. The rest was all new. New isn't a bad thing, but let us explore through the new world of Angry Birds.Let's start with the good. The animation on the birds is fantastic. It looks very detailed and they spent a lot of time on that to make it look right and the birds look perfect in this movie. A lot of the scenes are funny in just the right way. Take the yellow ""missile"" bird for example. Josh Gad nails this role and I loved the sequence with him when he had the cool copy of the Quick Silver scene from Days of Future Past. Hilarious. But I wish the rest of the movie was like that.Now let's talk about the bad. Wow this movie is boring. I am super glad that this movie is short because I was dying for this movie to end. It's awfully paced. So much of this movie is focused on the rising action that the climax feels like five minutes! Mighty Eagle was such a sloppy, boring, stupid character. He was so annoying! His actually character reminded me of Metro Man from Megamind. Metro Man if you don't know was the superhero of Metro City. Famous among all the citizens of the city. He then faked his death so he can escape having to work hard and save the same person over and over again. It was boring to him. He was then discovered to be alive but not as a superhero anymore. Mighty Eagle was a similar character. But he was such an idiot. The pigs were laughably bad. They were even singing country music it was so bad. They were annoying. They look awful. Not one of them even got a black eye which is disappointing. There was maybe one cool scene with them and that was when they flew the airplanes and I thought right away bad piggies and I just thought about how cool of a sequence it would be of them flying and the birds attacking them. It would be my favorite scene by far but the slingshot had to break in the worst way possible. Such a wasted opportunity.Speaking of wasted opportunities where the heck were the little blue birds? Granted they are in this movie but only for ten seconds. And the pink bird! She did nothing in the movie! All the other birds did all their cool tricks but the pink bird was so wasted and ruined. And the only thing parents might find interesting is the fact that the red bird says ""pluck my life."" Yeah that happened. But no other thing will be interesting to an adult in this movie.I am pretty sure that Angry Birds is forever dead because this movie could not bring back the nostalgia of the actual first game for me. It gave me boring humor and wasted opportunities with bad characters in the mix. But hey! At least kids like it."
155,The Angry Birds Movie,3,26 May 2016,"Watch the Trailer, Ditch the Movie","The gags in the trailer were on par with the best Pixar movies, and with names like Maya Rudolph, Jason Sudeikis, Bill Hader, Peter Dinklage, Sean Penn, Keegan-Michael Key and Kate McKinnon, my wife and I were sure this was going be a laugh riot. Wrong. The only thing on par with Pixar was the animation. The bulk of the gags were weak and often cliché. Most of the content, especially in the first third of the movie, was so adult oriented (e.g. political/psychological struggles) that the children in the theater quickly lost interest. It wasn't until the birds began to battle with the pigs (not a spoiler for anyone who knows the game) that the children settled down. There was mild entertainment value in the avian sociopolitical struggles but it was all so hackneyed and humorously flat, it elicited a train of yawns from my wife and I. I'm certainly glad we didn't pay the luxury theater price (Captain America was playing -- we should have seen that, instead!) BTW: I'm an avid Angry Birds player, but not my wife, and we both walked away from the movie shaking our heads and wishing we hadn't wasted the time. Hopefully the new Disney movie, Alice Through The Looking Glass, is better!"
156,The Angry Birds Movie,2,28 May 2016,inappropriate for young children,"It's a shame that parents are bombarded with marketing for movies like this - obviously geared towards young kids. Riding on the coat tails of a very popular video game - FOR KIDS. This movie was not appropriate for young kids! The look of the movie is very appealing, the message of the movie is appropriate, even how to deal with anger was good. However, the waving of cartoon butts dominating the Big Screen (even slapping butts at one point) was very disappointing. The pigs wear chaps at one point - again with the butts. There's so many near cusses, and potty humor. (The hero stands and pees with the stream going directly down the center of the screen for a full 2 - 3 minutes it seems). These are not things I'd want my young kids duplicating or even thinking was okay. Thankfully, my kids are older (11 & 16) and we were looking for something silly to fill some time. If I were a parent of kids 3 - 7, I would not take them to see this movie. Unless, you want your kids to go around slapping their rear ends & saying ""OHMY GAAA"" and ""Shell yes""."
157,The Angry Birds Movie,3,26 May 2016,No moral and some bad language,"Let me begin by saying yes, I know this movie is intended for children. In that regard, kids will probably like it. However, as a parent who wants to let my 6 and 4 year old see the Angry Birds movie, I was very disappointed in the storyline and the bad language throughout. I went to see Angry Birds before deciding to let my kids see it, I'm glad I did. There was quite a bit of mild profanity (Butt: 5, Shut Up: 3, OMG: 4, Pluck my life: 1, Dumb: 1, Dummy: 1, Idiot: 2, sucks: 1, Crap: 2). Knowing kids love to repeat stuff they hear in movies, I was surprised at all of this. I know to most people this isn't such a big deal, but when you're expecting a PG movie for kids, these kinds of words add up and make an impact.In addition to the language, there was no moral or lessons learned. The advertisements state that ""It's this years Lego Movie!"". That couldn't be further from the truth. The Lego Movie had an underlying theme and a surprisingly touching lesson. I was hoping that Red would have gone through some kind of change of heart or life lesson where he leaned to control his anger and use his strength for good. Maybe in the process making more friends (which i guess he did) and becoming a kind of super hero. Instead, the plot just takes us to a few examples of his anger, his anger management class, and finally using his anger to get other birds angry enough to attack the pigs. I won't be letting my kids watch it even though they are begging to see it. I feel bad that they will miss out just because the film makers focused too much on making it raunchy and forgot to add any depth to the storyline."
158,The Angry Birds Movie,6,17 July 2016,better than expected,"Red (Jason Sudeikis) is an angry bird alone on an island of flightless happy birds. He's a birthday clown who got angry. He's sentenced to anger management class by Judge Peckinpah (Keegan-Michael Key). Matilda (Maya Rudolph) is teaching speedster Chuck (Josh Gad), explosive Bomb (Danny McBride), and quiet giant Terence (Sean Penn). A ship arrives and two pigs, Leonard (Bill Hader) and Ross, disembark. Red sneaks on the ship and discovers more pigs. The birds are perfectly happy with them except for Red. As more pigs arrive and take over, Red asks Chuck and Bomb for help to find the legendary Mighty Eagle (Peter Dinklage).It sounds like a stupid idea. After Lego, I'm trying to stay open-minded. This one turns out to be better than expected but it's not overly imaginative. First, Red is a functional leading character. He's angry but it isn't funny like Shrek. Chuck is more or less his fast-talking sidekick but they don't have enough chemistry. Maybe they'll be better in the future. Chuck and Bomb have the most fun together. They're a goofy comedy duo. The Mighty Eagle pool is probably the best.The story is fine. It tries to say something about anger but it's nowhere near good enough. This is mostly loud and bright for the little kids. They even get to launch the birds at the pig city. Overall, this is fine for what it's trying to do."
159,The Angry Birds Movie,4,3 June 2016,"Go see X-Men instead- not horrible, but it could've been a LOT better","First of all, I thought this would be a good way to pass some time and have some fun at the movies, as the trailers grabbed my interest. I saw this a couple days after it was released and came in with low expectations due to the mixed reviews, but I left the theater rather unimpressed. I felt that the movie didn't hoist my attention span enough for me to care about the movie in a lot of spots, mostly because I've seen it all done before. Same goes for the humor, which really disappointed me, because the trailers actually a few genuine laughs out of me, but in the movie, I didn't laugh as much as I wanted to, and the rest of the audience can be an example as evidence for my opinion- they only chuckled at the occasional spot, and nothing else was heard from the theater. I'll admit that the animation, soundtrack(Ozzy, man!) and voice-over work was pretty good, and there were some good giggles I got from the movie, if rare, but other than that, I pretty much wasted my time by heading to the cinema to see this movie, and I believe you shouldn't either. I won't say it's an atrocity, but I'm still sticking with my thoughts on this. However, if you want to go to the theater, I'd recommend seeing X-Men: Apocalypse. Trust me, I had a blast watching that, it has everything you would want from a movie- incredible special effects, gripping action sequences, fantastic performances from the cast, hilarious humor, a nostalgic 80s soundtrack, a ruthless villain and the icing on the cake- an imaginative use of 3D effects. Speaking of which, if you do happen to decide to go and see this movie despite my warning, see the 2D version, the 3D added nothing to the experience with little to no depth or pop-out moments."
160,The Angry Birds Movie,4,21 May 2016,"The Angry Birds Movie aims all over the place, but it's jokes and story miss too often and is nowhere as addicting as the game","Have you ever met someone who has NOT downloaded Angry Birds onto their smart phone? I sure haven't. It shouldn't even come as a surprise as the addicting game from Finland has been installed over two-billion times worldwide. It's gotten a sequel, several spin-offs, a couple of movie tie-ins, and even has a cartoon series. What makes it's really popular are two things. It's relatively simple where the simple goal is to slingshot your way into the pigs, hoping to kill them all. It was easier to teach my dad this then to try and explain Sonic the Hedgehog. The other appeal is that the design is bright and colorful. You could even call it ironic, giving the dark nature of the flinging birds.Just like the recent Ratchet & Clank, this game is giving the animated feature length format a try. Unlike the latter that already had a full story to use, the premise of the Angry Birds game is extremely thin; it's birds versus the pigs. Now unlike some that already dismissed the idea of expanding this, I felt there was potential to this. Not a lot, but some. So does The Angry Birds Movie have the right idea for a film? It does, but well here's the story.On a tropical island full of flightless birds, a grumpy bird Red (played by Jason Sudekis) seems to be an outcast due to his violent nature. His recent outburst at a birthday party sends him to anger management, as overseen by the overly happy therapist, Matilda (played by Maya Rudolph). Some of the others in the class include the high energy filled Chuck (played by Josh Gad), the explosive (literally!) Bomb (played by Danny McBride), and the really big Terence (played by Sean Penn). The four try to take in their lessons, until a ship pulls in.The captain of this ship is a pig! A green pig Leonard (played by Bill Hader) who tells the birds that there are from another island that's all pigs. The rest of the bird community seems pretty excited to these new visitors, all except for Red who suspicious. After winning them over with parties, the pigs make it off with all of the eggs, putting most of the expecting children in jeopardy. After trying to seek the advice of the Mighty Eagle (played by Peter Dinklage), Red leads the birds to the pig island where they'll use a slingshot to try and beat them.The Angry Birds Movie does build some characters, gives them a world where this would seem likely and even a premise to use the slingshot mechanics from the game. So what wrong with it? Boring.You can tell with the strange premise, the film tries to have fun and throws a ton of jokes at you, but very few of them got a laugh out of me. My problem is that instead of being clever, there's a lot of crass and crude jokes that are too cheap (butt jokes, pee jokes, and even sexual jokes). Along with the ironically safe humor, the given story does not justify its ninety-minute running time. Like the rubber band of the slingshot, it's stretches itself too far (I even counted four unneeded musical montages). A better writer might have done more along with more usage of it's comedians.At it's best, the animation is nice to look at. The last act, when it resembles the game, is a lot of fun. The best humor comes here too when it goes dark with the amount of destruction it does to the pigs. I really wanted more of the dark stuff, but nope; more butt and pee jokes.I'll give this four Angry Birds apps out of ten. You could say that the movie aims all over the place, but the jokes and story miss too much to be as addicting as the game. Ill keep my finger on my smartphone rather then this movie ticket."
161,The Angry Birds Movie,1,30 May 2016,Would not watch it again if you paid me!,"I only watched Angry Birds because my grandson wanted to see it. However, it was a waste of time and money. I thought perhaps it was me but after I talked to a young father with kids in elementary school, I found out that I was not alone. If this movie does well, it is because of ""eye candy"" for kids and kids nagging their parents to take them to see it. The best of the movie was in the trailer, which was free. I actually had a hard time staying awake in the movie. It's the only movie in which I dozed off at least eight times. Of course, what can you do with a movie patterned after an electronic game theme? The game is much better entertainment with much more variety and versions of the general theme. Spend your money on buying versions of the game for your or grandchildren rather than wasting your money on the movie."
162,The Angry Birds Movie,3,27 August 2016,Dumb - Check Metascores 30-50,"Trust the Metascore reviews on this one. I had heard many people say that this movie was hilarious and intriguing, but it did not meet my expectations. The first half of the movie was cheesy, dumb, and filled with sexual innuendo. Even my children recognized some of the inappropriate contexts, such as ripping off clothing on stage (bird strippers, seriously?). I'm sure it was meant to be funny, but the amount of innuendo kind of overshadowed the overall story and it added even more to an already jam-packed show. There was so much going on that it was overwhelming to watch. It could have been just as funny with a little less innuendo and a little more creative thinking. It was a basic story of isolated protagonist saving the world. My favorite part was probably the battle scene, because it referenced to playing the actual game. The last half wasn't bad, but I still feel like I could have spent my time better watching something else. I'm pretty upset that my husband convinced me to buy it because now we're stuck with a movie I probably won't ever have my kids watch again. If only they could've cut out all the sexual innuendo."
163,The Angry Birds Movie,6,15 June 2016,Perhaps the Best They Could Do Based Off the Game,"I went to see this movie a couple of weeks ago, since it was based off of the hit game which I have played a few times, and since an animated film is fun now and again. I wasn't blown away, but I also didn't find it to be terrible.The film is of course based off of the hit video game by the same name which you can download on your mobile phone. In the game, you use a slingshot to hurl birds through the air in hopes of destroying structures made of wood and stone. In the structures are the faces of green pigs, which is the ultimate goal to knock out along with the rest of the buildings.The movie proceeds from this idea. The film revolves around ""Red"", the cardinal in the game that is the main component player early on. Red lives on an island of birds that cannot fly. Soon we learn that the island is being invaded by a horde of green pigs with nefarious intentions.That said, the plot of this movie wasn't the best, but given the structure of the video game and what the script writers had to work with, it was perhaps the best that they could come up with. Anything else wouldn't have jived with the way the game works.All that said, I'd give this movie 6/10 stars. Not great, but not a complete waste. Kids should love it--but fair warning, as there was a time or two when I felt like the adult humor was a bit pressing. The phrase ""Pluck you"" stood out as a bit unnecessary."
164,The Angry Birds Movie,,20 May 2016,Satisfying but alas not more.,"'Angry Birds' is the animated adaption of the same-titled mobile-game. Whenever a screen adaptation of any sort is due, I'm always fairly agog actually. Of course there is much more content in books or video games to effectively adapt from than in mobile phone games, which is why I've been somewhat skeptical at the beginning. How do you create a substantial movie experience out of a one-dimensional game but also remain faithful to it's source material? By all means, 'Angry Birds' managed to do that, in my opinion. 'Angry Birds' introduces all the birds known to us, charmingly extended with characteristics matching the particular bird. Main-bird is Red, a (who would have thought) red bird with striking black bushy eyebrows and an aggression problem. Along with other angry birds, Red attends a support group to help him with his short temper. On top of that, the birds are being visited by pigs, who much to the dismay of Red want to settle down on their beloved island. Since all residents seem to be blinded by their generosity, it's up to Red and his friends Bomber and Chuck to chase the pigs off of their island. Of course it's not that simple. Especially if you are a bird that can't fly. 'Angry Birds' is charming, but sadly not charming enough to cope over the things that I disliked. It's humorous, without doubt, and offers some smart puns but overall it simply tries too hard in order to be completely mesmerizing. The actual game is neatly and in my opinion successfully built into the movie. Despite that, the story however limps in some places. But not to be to negative I would say that Sony can be proud of their game-adaptation. Satisfying movies based on games are unfortunately too rare.'Angry Birds' offers primarily entertainment and humor for children, which may be dull for adults, despite one or another good joke. Plainly simple amusement with no deeper meaning. The kid in my theater loved it."
165,The Angry Birds Movie,4,31 July 2016,The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Angry Birds MovieOnline, people are either playing with themselves or playing against themselves.Fortunately, this animated-comedy was based on people performing the latter.An irate avian, Red (Jason Sudeikis), is incensed when a boatload of green-skinned pigs land on Bird Island and introduce the flightless populace to helium.Red's rage intensifies when more swine show up and all the birds' eggs start disappearing. Eventually Red and his equally flustered friends (Sean Penn, Danny McBride, Josh Gad) engage the pigs in warfare using weapons forged from pig tech in order to win back their missing ova.With subtle odes to colonialism and nods to the indoctrination of a native species, this vividly rendered kids cartoon based on the popular gaming app is surprisingly deep. Nevertheless, its profundity isn't enough to keep this humorless commercial from becoming tiresome.Furthermore, the birds' victory simply comes down to avian flu being more infectious than swine flu.

166,The Angry Birds Movie,,10 June 2016,Went In With Low Expectations,"I watched this film with low expectations, not expecting a lot because it is a film that was made due to the popularity of the app. Basically I expected to watch an animated train wreck, but it wasn't actually that bad of a film and I actually enjoyed it. The two main problems I had was a. they spent nearly an hour building up the conflict that everyone who watched the trailer (or knew about Angry Birds in general) knew was going to happen (I just found that they could have condensed it a little bit more than they did) and b. almost all of their best jokes were used in the trailer. This is a film that I think is better enjoyed if you forget about the trailer and just watch it. Also it is a film that is incredibly typical for animated movies, so it is a great film if you want to watch something playful that doesn't take a lot of energy to watch or require a lot of thought."
167,The Angry Birds Movie,6,3 June 2016,Angry Screenplay.,"The Angry Birds Movie (2016): Dir: Clay Kaytis, Fergal Reilly / Voices: Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Peter Dinklage: Animation about confronting one's anger. Jason Sudeikis voices Red, a foul tempered bird that is sentenced to anger management after several incidents gone wrong. Josh Gad voices Chuck who is in anger management because he is too fast and often runs into mischief because of this. Danny McBride voices Bomb who can explode at any time. The pathetic excuse for a plot regards a group of green pigs that arrive by boat sporting a friendly demeanor but Red senses that something is wrong. It becomes apparent that these pigs are out to steal the eggs. At any rate the one thing these birds should be angry at, besides their inability to fly, is a screenplay so lazy that he fails to take off. The bright side is the colorful characters headed by Red who maintains sarcasm until the blatant sentimental ending. Other characters include anger management conductor Matilda, voiced by Maya Rudolph. Peter Dinklage voices the most interesting character in the Mighty Eagle, a character of mystery to Red and his friends until they witness the out of shape nature that he really is. This is also interesting in terms of Dinklage in size and the character that he voices. The animation is flashy but the humour might be too adult for the audience that this is aimed at. There is a message regarding anger and dealing with it but it also counters with this by presenting what they call acceptable anger that leads to action violence. Nice attempt but the anger is within a screenplay that doesn't fly. Score: 6 / 10"
168,The Angry Birds Movie,10,22 August 2017,Hilarious and Clever,"This movie is hilarious. Is it deep, thought-provoking, tear-inducing cinema like Pixar? No. However, what this movie is is a hilarious, dry, sarcastic, satirical comedy that can appeal to anyone, but will be the funniest to adults who understand all of the subtle jokes.This movie thrives off of its breakneck pacing. It keeps the jokes coming, and this can be largely attributed to the main character, Red. Every word out of his mouth is comedy gold. His commentary on the ridiculously optimistic world around him is absolutely hilarious. The other main characters, Chuck and Bomb, have their moments too. The writers have a lot of fun with the ridiculousness that is a bird that explodes when he's angry. The finale of the movie was absolutely perfect. I honestly couldn't think of a better way to have ended it. The entire film is somewhat satirical in nature, but the way they tie the movie back to the game in a tongue-in-cheek, winking-at-the-camera way is just perfect and hilarious.The writers also managed to work in a bunch of other clever moments, including a RickRoll, the song, ""Sound of the Da Police"", a shining reference/spoof, and many others that I can't think of right now. It is also nice and short; it doesn't overstay its welcome like many movies do these days.I recommend this movie to pretty much anyone."
169,The Angry Birds Movie,,24 April 2017,Good movie but flawed,"This movie was not very good. Admittedly, before watching this film I knew it was not going to be that good. I was surprised that I liked the film even though it is very average. This is what happens when you make movies based off video games. They do not turn out well. Nonetheless, I think that it had potential but it had lots of room for improvement. I would just skip it if you're looking for a good movie. But if you're looking for a funny movie that you don't care if it is dumb then go see it. 6/10"
170,The Angry Birds Movie,5,10 March 2017,"Average Animated Fun,","Angry Birds is a mediocre movie with an average plot and a stellar voice cast. It is whimsical fun that has a lot of surprisingly funny moments, terrifically delivered by its cast. Jason Sudekis is stellar in the lead role, delivering the character's anger with great passion. He is also joined by the likes of Danny McBride, Bill Hader and Josh Gad, it has a stellar ensemble. The film does not try very hard to be entertaining for adults, I understand that it is aimed at kids, but it did not have to be solely this way. It could have taken a note from the likes of Toy Story and Shrek, making it humorous and clever enough that it is not unbearable for adults. It's plot is very typical, there is really nothing other than the story. It has a beginning, s middle, and end, it has the same structure as any kids movie and nothing in between. It is mindless, simple fun that I will admit had me smiling at times, even if there is nothing there to amaze. Funny and forgettable, if you are looking for a film for your kids to enjoy, Angry Birds might be a delightful choice, otherwise you should avoid. When an island populated by birds is invaded by green pigs, it's up to three birds to put a stop to this."

172,The Angry Birds Movie,6,25 December 2016,"The Angry Birds Movie is just a mediocre adaptation of the most popular game.Except the last half and hour and good 3D,this movie has nothing new to offer.","The Angry Birds Movie (2016): Downloaded onto everyone's iPhones around 2010, Angry Birds was the definition of a time-guzzling smartphone app it was beyond all human power to resist playing. I compete against strangers in weekly tournaments by launching flightless birds of varying shapes, hues and special combative powers via a slingshot and aiming them at snorty green pigs.Well I didn't have any interest about those birds personal lives but they made a movie on this addictive game.So did the movie is addictive same as its movie?Plot: In The Angry Birds Movie, we'll finally find out why the birds are so angry. The movie takes us to an island populated entirely by happy, flightless birds - or almost entirely. In this paradise, Red (Jason Sudeikis), a bird with a temper problem, speedy Chuck (Josh Gad), and the volatile Bomb (Danny McBride) have always been outsiders who met each other in Anger Management Classes. But when the island is visited by mysterious green piggies lead by Leonard (Bill Hader), it's up to these unlikely outcasts to figure out what the pigs are up to.So how did these outcasts save entire birds from piggies?Plus Points:1)Animation: Animation is awesome.Rovio Animations and Sony Pictures put lot of efforts to bring a bright animation which is flawless.Except overly naked pigs,all of the animation is good.2)3D: Even it lacks a perfect depth I think this is one of the rare animated movie which has good pop-out effects,Especially the sling shot scenes in last half and hour is brilliant in 3d.Even the beaks of the birds protrude out few times.3)Last half and hour: This part is the only exciting moment for the fans of the game.It has the most fun of the sling shot which is the main play in the game.The birds traveling by sling shot and destroying the piggies kingdom gives us a good cinematic moment from the game with decent 3D effects.Minus Points:1)Cliched Plot and Screenplay: Except the last half and hour,The Angry Birds Movie has nothing special.It has typical plot where the lone outcast character saves the city wit his weird friends.Instead of elevating the Angry Birds concept to surreal heights of insane genius, the filmmakers settle for a tale bogged down by familiar themes plucked from much better films2)Very few funny moments: I did laugh out loud once few times but most of the times,the dialogues and scenes are not at all funny.So,The Angry Birds Movie is just a mediocre adaptation of the most popular game.Except the last half and hour and good 3D,this movie has nothing new to offer.My rating 6/10"
173,The Angry Birds Movie,5,10 December 2016,"As a children's movie based on a popular app, its at least passable","In this generation, Hollywood has reached the point where novels, comic books, television shows, and even video games are no longer the only subjects to big screen adaptations. Hollywood has now expanded upon this range with popular smart phone apps serving as sources of inspirations, and this is where first-time directors Clay Kaytis and Fergal Reilly of Sony Animation Studios unleash the highly popular game 'Angry Birds' in film form. This game garnered strong memorability for it's addictive gameplay of launching colorful birds with a catapult and crashing into tall structures manned by green pigs, but the idea of turning this popular game into animated cinematic vehicle seems highly questionable. And though the results are enough to garner fair attention of elementary-school kids, it only rises at an entertainment level that is likely to leave parents either scratching their heads and annoyed than invested in this thin laugh-fest. So this film is set on an island where birds live happy and peaceful lives except for one bird in particular named Red (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) fosters a grumpy attitude and has often alienates himself from the community. In response, no one on the island has gained much of a liking for him. After a horrible incident, Red is admitted into an anger management where he meets yellow bird Chuck (voiced by Josh Gad) and an explosive black bird named Bomb (voiced by Danny McBride). What eventually continues as an average grows into a surprise when a fleet of green pigs captained King Mudbeard (voiced by Bill Hader) arrive on their island in hopes of making a home there. Everything starts off fine until Red learns a secret diabolical plan to destroy the island and rob everyone of their eggs.In terms of child-friendly animated movies, there is a significant distinction between a movie that appeals to children in the single-digit ages and a movie that appeals to both children and adults of all ages. The creative efforts of Sony Animation Studios here result in a movie that falls mostly in the former category, it is only too bad that this film fails on the deliver on the standards of Sony Animation's previous efforts such as 'Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs' (which garnered fair family appeal). This film sees a glamorous cast of actors including Jason Sudeikis, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, Josh Gad, Maya Rudolph, Peter Dinklage, and Sean Penn among a string of criminally underused actors; and places in the voices of cute furry (and not furry) animals who all demonstrate fair comedic potential. Nonetheless, the film fosters only a handful of jokes including an absurdly long pee joke that can certainly leave the youngsters cracking up while leaving the adults spitting nothing more than quick chuckles. There is definitely not enough clever humor to sustain the film above the level of passable children's comedy nor does it strike up enough substance to please audience of the older age range. If you are a parent or adult, the best treats this cartoon manages to sneak in is a small of range of surprisingly raunchy innuendo including one juvenile replacement of the F-word (that will hopefully fly over kids' heads).As this is indeed in a children's animated flick, there is at least a good amount of charm to be handed. But to extent, there is nothing really special. The characters (mostly the main three: Red, Chuck, and Bomb) are likable to make for some cute characters for young children to crave on and the colorful computer animation done on them (particularly on the fair of the animals) as well as the environment is beautifully done. But whether or not they reach the capacity to gain the heart of adults is quite questionable. Obviously, children who grew up playing the game on the iPhone, iPad, or any other electronic device are the primary targets for getting a kick out the characters or even the plot. In terms of the film's faithfulness to the popular source material, it does an okay job especially for an adaptation of game that values more gameplay over an actual storyline. When adapting a game dealing with slingshooting a bird that breakable objects, the lack of a cohesive story often places a severe restraint on proper story development. Fortunately, writer Jon Vitti manages to squeeze a little juice out of the source material by delivering a plot that doesn't reimburse much homage to the game until the final act when our characters engage in a frenetic catapult battle against the army of green pigs. Complete with countless explosions and a squeak of small laughs, this long action sequence is somewhat fun but does little make for the all the parts of the film that criminally fail to work.The Angry Birds Movie is mediocre children's animated flick that might provide a few good laughs and fun for young kids or maybe a few teenagers. But it never quite succeeds above the level of a disposable animated feature nor does it hold the quality of a classic cartoon. While this movie offers a pinch of cuteness and charm, but should have been more fun than this."
