0,The Great Mouse Detective,10,25 February 2002,A Glorious Movie With An Unusually Developed Cast!,"This is, by far, one of the most underappreciated Disney classics of all, and one of the most developed as far as the character and the story.  Basil is a perfect portrayal of Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes, and many don't know that it was based off a book about a mouse who lived the life of his idol, none other than Sherlock Holmes.Personally, I love this movie because it has a colorful, developed cast of characters.Basil is not your average Disney hero, having no love interest at any point in the movie; he is also a super-intelligent character and often bursts into fits of scientific observation.  His facial expressions are timed well and are very well done, as well as his general movement.  He is very excitable and you can tell he adores working on cases.  He doesn't really like children, as you can see from the way he treats Olivia in the beginning. You really get a feel for Basil when watching him, and he's not easy to forget.  Kids may not understand half of the things he's saying, but it's fun to watch.Olivia is the little heroine mouse who starts Basil on his case, losing her father to a mysterious peg-legged bat of whom Basil is aware of.  She is extremely plain-drawn and has no emphasis on her gender really, save for the bow in her hair and her voice, making her very realistic.  She also acts alot like a realistic little girl, in her laugh, in the way she reacts to things, even in the way she exclaims ""father!"" when reunited with her toymaker father.  Her curiosity is classic, and she has a high adoration for Basil, though he doesn't appreciate her at the start of the story.Dawson is the elder mouse who finds Olivia looking for Basil of Baker Street.  He isn't sure of who Basil is, but they end up finding him together.  Dawson is, of course, Watson in mouse form, and helps Basil in his first case, being this movie.Ratigan is the villain played by the late horror film star Vincent Price, and quite well in my opinion.  He has the likeness of Mr. Price in the way he moves and acts.  Of course, nothing is weirder than hearing him sing, but it happens twice in the movie-- ""The World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" and ""Goodbye, So Soon"" were both written specifically for Price.  He is not one of the more frightening villains as far as his looks, and is unique in that up until the climax he uses his intelligence to battle Basil, instead of the strength he obviously posesses.  On a special note, Ratigan dislikes being called a rat for some reason, though I cannot remember why.Fidget is probably one of the darkest villain henchmen in a Disney movie. He is frightening to children in appearance and voice, and the music accompanying him adds a comical aura.  Fidget is by far my favorite Disney henchman, just because he's funny.  The one thing that bothers me, though, is that a few times in the movie, his peg leg switches from right to left. I think it was just for the reuniting scene in which Olivia steps on his only foot, so it was switched.The movie has many fast-paced scenes, including ""Investigation At The Toy Shop"" and ""Big Ben Chase"", among others.  My personal favorite is ""Big Ben Chase,"" because it is one of the longest Disney climaxes and it is a very unlikely setting.  The movie itself is about Olivia's toymaker father being kidnapped by Fidget, and her turning to Basil for help.  Basil's nemesis, Ratigan, is linked to the bat, and Basil, who was reluctant and annoyed by Olivia's protest at first, jumps at the oppertunity to see if he can finally defeat Ratigan.  The movie goes from there with its ""many twists and turns"", to quote Basil.If you want a fun-filled, unpredictable adventure, The Great Mouse Detective is your best bet.  Especially if you're a Sherlockian or Eve Titus fan who has yet to see this exiciting portrayal of Basil of Baker Street."
1,The Great Mouse Detective,10,17 October 2003,A forgotten Disney masterpiece.,"This is probably one of the most unknown Disney classics.For the time the movie was quite new and revolutionary and it doesn't quite fit in with the other movies Disney made in that period., perhaps that's the reason why it has been forgotten. But ""The Great Mouse Detective"" deserves to be known and seen.The characters are real classics and one of the best to have ever appeared in a Disney movie. Actually Professor Ratigan (voiced by the legendary Vincent Price) is quite possibly my favorite movie villain of all time. No wonder that it was Vincent Price's favorite role. His style and humor is priceless and it cracks me up every time. But the other characters are also very memorable. I especially like the character of doctor Dawson.The story is good and very pleasant and very mature compared to other Disney's from that period. But of course the idea of making a story about the mouse version of Sherlock Holmes alone is already good enough to make a fun movie about.One of the other things that makes this movie different compared to other Disney's from that period are the songs or better said the lack of it. The movie features only one song (3 if you count the bar song and the goodbye, so soon song.). But it's not a miss. The surprising magnificent musical score by famous composer Henry Mancini make up for this loss.The movie has a very spectacular final on and in the famous Big Ben. It's by far my favorite Disney movie ending.Certainly a fun movie to watch over and over again.10/10P.S.: If you're Dutch speaking, I highly recommend that you watch this movie Dutch spoken. Believe it or not it's even better and more fun then the English version! Believe me, just give it a shot.http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
2,The Great Mouse Detective,10,27 January 2004,"A very cute Disney movie, one of my favorites!","The Great Mouse Detective is one of my favorite Disney films of all time, it's also one of the most under rated in my opinion. I think just because I love the story so much and it always brought up good memories, this was the funniest Disney animated movie I had seen at the time. It's just such a cute film, it has fun animation, catchy songs, and such a touching story that anyone could easily fall in love with. My parents and I watched this movie together all the time when I was a child, still to this day, I don't mind sitting down to watch it, it's just that much fun.A young little mouse girl and her toy shop father are celebrating her birthday, but her father is quickly taken away by a rotten gang of mice who are led by a giant rat, Ratigan, who is planning to over throw the queen and become leader of the mouse world. Olivia, the daughter, goes to Basil of Baker Street, he's a mad detective who has been chasing Ratigan for a long time. Along with the help of an average mouse, Dr. Dawson, Olivia, and Basil go after Ratigan to make sure that his plan fails.The Great Mouse Detective is such a cute film. I'm very sure that you'll enjoy it, it's one of my personal favorites, I really do think this is one of the better Disney films and is an under rated treasure. I just loved Basil, his madness was just so funny and enjoyable to watch. I also loved Ratigan's song of why he is so great, not to mention how he thinks he's a mouse is just priceless. This is a fun family film to watch, I highly recommend it.10/10"
3,The Great Mouse Detective,,15 January 2001,One of Vincent Price's Favorite Roles,"I enjoy this film for one main thing, besides the attention to detail concerning Victorian England...the performance of Vincent Price as Ratigan in his scenery-chewing glory. Yes, it's another mice-beneath-your-feet story, but it's so well done. Holmesians will enjoy it's inside jokes and references to other works about the famous fictional sleuth.
Fans of ""Ducktales"" may note that Alan Young, the voice of toymaker Hiram Flaversham, parlayed his near-perfect Scottish accent into being appointed the official voice of Scrooge McDuck. But it's Vincent Price in what he later called one of his most favorite roles ever (He even had two original songs written for him!) that draws me back to this film again and again. He clearly enjoyed this role, and the exaggerated movements of Ratigan are obviously his.An oddly gothic cartoon from Disney, and well worth viewing."
4,The Great Mouse Detective,8,3 July 2004,Forgotten Classic with Some of the Best Animation in History,"Having revisited this film on the anniversary of its first release I was shocked at how good it is. I was also left to wonder why Disney never did anything with it since its release since its a very good film.The plot is simple, Basil of Baker Street helps a young girl find her kidnapped father who is the clutches of the evil Ratigan. There's more to it than that but thats a place to start.Vincent Price, probably having the time of his life, is the foul villain and he seems to be having a complete ball. What ever joy he was feeling must have been infectious since the work the animators did carried over and its fun to watch Price's animated alter ego mug for the camera.This is the last of the un-politically correct films from The Mouse House. Characters smoke, which as we all know is now a no no since Disney is now going back and digitally erasing all trace of that ""bad habit"" from all of their earlier films. Characters die. Yes the villain still dies these days, and perhaps a Mom to get the plot going, but here we have  several characters die, one simply for insulting the villain.The final sequence of this film, a battle in and on Big Ben was promoted as Disney's first major use of computer animation. The sequence is spectacular and one of the greatest animated pieces I've ever witnessed even today. The whole thing lasts maybe five minutes but it pushes the art of animation as far as Disney has ever gone and shows us what a loss the politically correct, story formula has been in the realm of artistic animation. Disney learned how to make money but not films that pushed the envelope of what was possible. What might have happened if they had expanded on this one sequence?See this movie. I give it 8 out of 10. Its not perfect but it is funny and exciting in ways that the films that followed rarely were. The film also contains several moments that prove that Pixar are not the only ones who can make movies that reflect the Warner Brothers style."
5,The Great Mouse Detective,,26 June 2003,I love it!,"Great Mouse Detective is one of the best Disney movies I've seen yet. The animation is that classic Disney style and (thank Goodness) it lacks all of those annoying songs. As a true Sherlockian, I can only say that this is as good as it gets as far as Holmes goes. No matter what everyone says, It is still great. Kids may not get some parts f it, but every Sherlockian knows what's going on. While Ratigan may be no Moriarty, he's still the perfect example of the classic Disney villain. Vincent Price is a terrific actor, and Alan Young as Flaversham was the perfect fit. Young Susanne Pollatschek is the perfect Olivia and no one could do a better Basil than Barrie Ingham. Val Bettin makes a lovable Dawson. Fidget is the classic evil crony. This is absolutely a must see. For all you baby-sitters out there, and I know from personal experience, take this to your next job and the kids won't even blink for over an hour. It's one of the most memorable Disney movies of it's age. Although Beauty and the Beast will always be my favorite, GMD runs an extremely close second! I give it 11/10! It's that good!I always say when I write these, I loved this movie, but you may not. So how do you decide if you like it? See it! Form your own opinion! After all, one man's trash and all like that! Hope you find a good one!"
6,The Great Mouse Detective,10,13 October 2006,an overlooked masterpiece,"""The Great Mouse Detective"" is one of Disney's best films, in my opinion, because it doesn't pander to children. In this movie, the characters go to a bar, get into fights, and stripping is alluded to. However, that's not to say it isn't appropriate for children. I watched this movie when I was very young and I was so innocent that I didn't realize what those things meant. Now that I am older, I still enjoy the film. That's what makes it so great- it's enjoyable for both children and adults. Vincent Price is amazing in this film playing one of Disney's best villains. I don't know the other voice actors, but they were also great, especially the person playing Olivia. Her Scottish accent was spot-on and so darn cute. Strong characterization is one of the stronger points in this movie. Although Basil may appear cynical on the outside, he is really a sucker for Olivia. Dawson is charming and kind, Fidget is 10 times more hilarious than your average bumbling sidekick, and as I said already, Ratigan and Olivia are sublime. The Great Mouse Detective also has great music. It features 3 original songs, ""World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" and ""Goodbye So Soon"" performed by Vincent Price, and ""Let Me Be Good to You"" performed by Melissa Manchester as the white dancer mouse. I am proud to say that LMBGTY is one of my favorite songs of all time. Also, an excellent original score is prevalent in this movie- I wish I knew somewhere were I could get my hands on a soundtrack!! The animation is dark and moody- generally not what you'd expect from a Disney movie, and the Big Ben scene is impressive even 20 years later.I highly recommend this movie for all Disney fans, and even for non-Disney fans. Great Mouse Detective is a diamond in the rough!!"
7,The Great Mouse Detective,9,12 September 2011,Does not deserve to be so underrated,"The Great Mouse Detective is so underrated, it's criminal. How does nobody know about this?! It has one of the best cast of characters in a Disney film, one of the best Disney villains ever (voiced by the amazing Vincent Price, no less), and is packed with fun and adventure.Brilliant and eccentric detective Basil of Baker Street is given the case of a lifetime when young Olivia Flavisham comes to his doorstep for help. Her father, a gifted toymaker, has been abducted by Professor Ratigan, a notorious criminal whom Basil has been chasing for years. With the help of the young mouse and the kindly but down-to-earth Dr. Dawson, Basil sets out to rescue Olivia's father and foil Ratigan's scheme.The story seems a bit plain, but the plot isn't what makes TGMD exciting. It is the characters which bring the movie to life and make it worth watching. Being based off Sherlock Holmes himself, Basil is naturally an intelligent badass. He's enthusiastic about his work and little else at the beginning of the film, and doesn't care much for Dawson and Olivia upon first meeting them, but as the film progresses he starts opening up to them, especially Olivia. It's a nice bit of character development which gives the film heart without becoming sentimental. Dr. Dawson's warmer and less dramatic personality provides the perfect foil for Basil, and Olivia is charming and adorable without being cutesy-cutesy or annoying. But the best character has to be Ratigan, one of the great unsung Disney villains. He's funny as hell, gleefully enjoying every bit of evil he engages in and doing so with larger-than-life style; on the other hand, he can be pretty scary too, and if he snaps, boy are you screwed. He's voiced brilliantly by Vincent Price, who you can tell had a lot of fun doing the part.The animation isn't breathtaking, but it's still good. A lot of the character animation is done extremely well, in particular facial expressions. The backgrounds are lovely and dark, perfectly giving the film the atmosphere of foggy Victorian London.Though it's not much of a musical, the few songs in TGMD are good. I especially like ""Let Me Be Good to You"", which is catchy and, when viewed in context to the film, very suggestive and adult. Hilarious. Good characters, good songs, humor, heart, adventureit's all there. It's no Pinocchio or Beauty and the Beast, but it's still a wonderful movie. How awful it is that it isn't well-known! It's one of those Disney films you'll still enjoy even when you're older, and if you haven't seen it yet, definitely check it out.8/10"
8,The Great Mouse Detective,7,15 March 2012,Walt Disney picture about a Sherlockian mouse  with lots of entertainment and amusement,"¨The great mouse detective¨ also titled ¨The adventure of the great mouse detective ¨ is a Walt Disney cartoon feature based on famous characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle adapted of Eve Titus' book titled ¨Basil of Baker Street¨ .

9,The Great Mouse Detective,8,22 September 2013,"An awesome hero and villain await those who decide to see ""The Great Mouse Detective""","The Walt Disney Company's 26th full-length animated feature film, ""The Great Mouse Detective"" (1986), was considered one of the better films made in the period between ""The Jungle Book"" (1967) and ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989). That may not sound like high enough praise seeing that this period was regarded as one of the company's lowest points with duds such as ""The Black Cauldron"" (1985). But trust me when I say that the praise is well justified in the case of ""The Great Mouse Detective"", which gets much of its entertainment value from an awesome hero and villain. A young Scottish mouse named Olivia is searching for a detective in London who can help search for her kidnapped toymaker father. With the help of Dr. David Dawson, she searches for a world-famous mouse detective by the name of Basil of Baker Street. Basil accepts the case since he is lead to believe that the main suspect of this kidnapping is his archenemy Professor Ratigan (Vincent Price, giving a fun performance in this juicy role). Ratigan plans on using Olivia's father to help build a robot of the Mice Queen, so he can rule all of England. Will Basil, Olivia, and Dawson be able to stop Ratigan before it's too late and rescue Olivia's father? ""The Great Mouse Detective"" is basically a kid-friendly version of any film or TV show based on Sherlock Holmes. As a matter of fact, in the world of this movie at least, Basil lives in the house of the one and only Sherlock Holmes. He even uses Sherlock's dog named Toby to help him solve this case and track down possible clues. There are a few scary scenes in this film, but they're not quite as dark as the previous Disney animated feature ""The Black Cauldron"". One is when we see Ratigan's henchman bat Fidget for the first time in a frightening close-up. Another is when we see one of Ratigan's drunken henchmen get eaten by Ratigan's cat as ordered by Ratigan himself, simply because he calls his boss a rat much to his intense disapproval. These scenes are scary, but in a good way. And speaking of Ratigan, let's delve further into why I think he's an awesome Disney villain, shall we? Ratigan has a key personality trait that any great Disney villain should have. He enjoys being evil, meaning that he's having the time of his life committing all the unjust crimes that he does. He loves being bad so much that we sort of like his character because he's so content with making his victims suffer. That's one more reason why we like villains in the first place. The central hero Basil is also worth talking about, too. His impressive intelligence and ability to solve crimes with ease is one thing, but to make him charming and fun at the same time is another thing altogether. ""The Great Mouse Detective"" makes for a good evening's entertainment for both kids and adults. Even if it isn't a groundbreaking film for Disney, it's at least a film that is confident and very well-told. The narrative is free of distractions, the animation is good as always, and the characters especially the hero and the villain still hold up well. If you're a fan of mysteries and are looking for a way to introduce young kids to them, then ""The Great Mouse Detective"" easily ranks as one of your best bets."
10,The Great Mouse Detective,8,22 January 2005,Sweet and adventurous,"This is by far one of the best Disney animations. The story gives you swash-buckling action and a genuine sweetness. Vincent Price as Ratigan was a stroke of genius. He puts so much of his dark personality into this part, as to exude the embodiment of treachery. He is by far my favorite Disney villain, because of Price. These characters were very well done, well developed, and endearing. This is one of those older productions in which the extras like backgrounds, furnishings, etc. are drawn with great attention to the styles and details. This adds so much to these animated productions, and are sadly forgotten in the newer ones and, unfortunately, the sequels.The use of a Disney-esquire Sherlock Holmes was brilliant, and the absence of those annoying songs was a definite plus. There is one. Just enough. I love Disney. I grew up on it, and have a rather decent collection of Disney animations and live action movies. I also understand that some people enjoy them, but those annoying songs are a factor which detracts from the enjoyability for me and I am glad they left them out, this time.It rates a 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :."
11,The Great Mouse Detective,7,22 April 2007,A good Disney movie that could have been great.,"Disney made many animated movies similar to this in the 80's. Not similar in story, theme or characters, but similar in the fact that they were all very forgettable. This, for me, was unfortunately a very forgettable film. It's a good movie though. In this Sherlock Holmes like adventure, a mouse detective Basil is searching for little Olivia's father with the help of Dr. Dawson who just came back from Afghanistan. The only one fiendish enough to have taken her father is none other than Professor Ratigan. This movie was a really great idea for a good Disney movie, but it fell short. The animation, while pretty good, was just too loose. The characters were all pretty good, my favorite being Ratigan, voiced perfectly by Vincent Price. The music in this was very good. There were only 3 songs that were catchy, but the main theme music is really fun to listen to. The final thing that put made this not as good as it could be, was the sound effects. In several places it's as though they forgot to put in sound effects, which really takes away from the movie. However, this is a good Disney movie, but just don't expect the quality you would've seen in Beauty and the Beast.My rating: *** out of ****. 71 mins. rated G."
12,The Great Mouse Detective,8,12 February 2004,Wonderful!,"Very enjoyable Disney cartoon has Basil of Baker Street (equal to our own Sherlock Holmes) as a mouse on the trail of a missing mouse's toymaker father. Quite scary at times for the little ones, but this is a surprisingly excellent modern-day Disney film with some good animation, good ideas, good execution, catchy songs, a grand finale worthy of applause, and some fine in-jokes for the older audience members who have some knowledge of Holmes's tales.**** 1/2 / *****"
13,The Great Mouse Detective,10,12 January 2014,Underrated Disney Classic,"The Great Mouse Detective (1986) is one of the greatest Disney movies of all time and definitely their most underrated film in my opinion. The movie features the wonderful voice talents of Vincent Price as a great Disney villain, Professor Rattigan, basically the Moriarty character opposing the movie's ""Sherlock"" hero character, the titular The Great Mouse Detective, Basil of Baker Street (living under the floor of Sherlock Holmes).I don't want to give away the plot but the reason I love this movie so much is that there is a lot of great comedy in it, the hero and villain are both fantastic (and both have very entertaining cohorts), and the story is great.I love that this film is a little bit ""darker"" than most Disney films. Again, I don't want to give anything away, but the stakes in this movie are much higher and more ""real"" than most Disney films.The songs are even great and I still find myself humming a couple of them. The Rattigan song is amazing, and Vincent Price himself sings a wonderful ""goodbye"" song that plays on a record while he has Basil trapped.A truly great Disney movie that deserves much more praise!"
14,The Great Mouse Detective,9,5 January 2010,Fun in the mid-eighties!,"Going on something of a sentimental journey I recently saw two Disney animated features that were released in my childhood: The Black Cauldron and The Great Mouse Detective. I was shocked.I had always thought that in between Jungle Book and Aladdin Disney hadn't really delivered anything worthwhile (aristocats and robin hood being OK, basically because of the great character-animation, but never as good as the older stuff), but these films are both great. I'll stick to TGMD here.The animation is simply irresistible. The London scenery is splendid, and the way the 'mouse-world' runs alongside real-life London is nicely done (The Great Mouse Detetctive, Basil of Baker Street, lives in a Victorian mouse-hole inside what appears to be Sherlock Holmes' home). The characters are among the best of Disney's ever. They succeeded in making the detective an interesting character, which is not an easy thing to achieve. But the villain, Rattigan, is absolutely super: sheer evil surpassing even Cruella and flair and presence comparable to the ghost in Aladdin. The Watson of the story (dr. Dawson) is one of the most charming characters since Balou the bear. The story is entertaining enough. But the most surprising to me is the freshness that the whole thing breathes. I didn't know that that kind of fun even existed in the mid-eighties. I can't wait till Disney will release this one as a special edition DVD. Try to check it out before that anyway, it's great!"
15,The Great Mouse Detective,9,31 May 2007,"A beautiful, creative, fun Disney!","Genre: Animated detective film with talking mice.This is definitely one of my favourite Disneys (on this date it's my current 2ND FAVOURITE!). It was made in the joyous period when I think Disneys were just starting to get just slightly better. Thank YOU SO MUCH for that period Disney! :) During that period Disney created lots of lovely stuff!Anyway, this heartwarming film has a particularly good plot for me. In a story, I like the idea of people getting captured and then escaping, like in this film. I also love the memorable and clever characters (Basil is SO entertaining and Olivia is so sweet and funny! :) )! SO WATCH THIS FILM!Olivia, a little mouse, is all alone in London - her dad has been kidnapped! :( She meets kindhearted Dawson, who takes her to Basil of Baker Street. He changes Dawson's life forever..."
16,The Great Mouse Detective,,31 August 2006,More Fun Than the Couple of Disney Films Before It,"""The Great Mouse Detective"" was either take it or leave it nowadays. It's a Disney film that surprisingly has a small fan following, and it deserves it. When this came out in 1986, it was some hope for the dying animation medium. After ""The Black Cauldron"", ambitious as it was, failed at the box office, the corporate Disney (Eisner, Katzenberg & Wells) were ready to kill off animation until this film was successful, video sales of Disney classics soared and Don Bluth's ""An American Tail"" becoming a huge hit.The film has a consistent plot with some entertaining scenes here and there, great characters and an overall sense of fun. That ""sense of fun"" couldn't be found in the previous post-Walt films (""The Fox and the Hound"" and ""The Black Cauldron"" come to mind). Short and sweet. The cast works well too, as Vincent Price does an excellent job as Ratigan and gives him a rather sadistic quality.The animators must've had a good time with this film, rather than ""The Fox and the Hound"" and ""The Black Cauldron"". However, the animation is rather cheap. Katzenberg wanted it that way, as he didn't greenlight the production until the budget turned out to be around $10 million. It looks like a Disney Saturday morning cartoon blown-up, but it isn't bad animation at all.The songs are alright. Ratigan's theme is good, along with a few others. The barroom production number is a bit weak though.Overall, it's got a sense of fun and it's a joy to watch, but it feels cheap and it doesn't have much ambition. Great fun, but not a serious Disney effort.An 8.7 out of 10."
17,The Great Mouse Detective,,1 September 2000,Disney`s darkest movie,"""The Great Mouse Detective"" has got to be one of the darkest of Disney`s movies.  I didn`t see the entire movie untill recently, and I liked it as a different Disney-movie. The setting is brilliant.  London in the 19th century is very atmospheric, and Disney`s animation makes it look good. The villains are great, and I used to think that Ratigan was a quite scary character.  He is still good. It is indeed a watchable movie, and you should see this instead of ""Pocahontas"" and ""Tarzan"". 8/10"
18,The Great Mouse Detective,10,8 October 2013,Best Disney Animated Movie of All Time,"Forget The Lion King, forget Frozen, forget Wreck-It Ralph (well, maybe not FORGET it), THIS is the greatest movie Disney's ever animated.The story is a pretty fun ride from start to finish, the movie taking full advantage of its animated medium to give us scenes in a toy shop with the mice riding on and making use of the toys to chase the villain, and a long ongoing shot in a clocktower that perfectly blends 3D computer animation with 2D hand-drawn animation.At first glance, one might mistakenly assume this is nothing more than a Sherlock Holmes story told with mice. Except it's not. The two main leads may be based on their human counterparts, but they do have their own characters.Basil is this egotistical but still very likable jerk-hero on a quest to match wits once again with his arch-nemesis, Professor Padriac Ratigan II. Basil has the same style as Sherlock Holmes, but the animation medium allows him to be a lot more cooky and funny than Holmes ever could be. He's really the best Disney hero. There have been a fair amount of handsome action heroes or Disney Princesses waiting to find true love. There is only ONE Basil of Baker Street, and his reputation remains untarnished by a lack of forced direct-to-video sequels.But by far the best thing this movie has going for it is Vincent Price as Professor Ratigan. Holy sh*t, this is the best villain that Disney has had. He's this egotistical, conniving, mustache-twirling villain that completely blows James Moriarty out of the water as far as enjoyability goes. He loves how much of a sick, twisted fiend he is so much that it's impossible not to enjoy it along with him.And, to date, he is the only Disney villain who actually gave our competent, highly intelligent hero a run for his money without leading to his own downfall. Yeah, really think about that. Maleficent played opposite to a guy with a sword and was taken down because she was too evil to just finish him off. Ursula's plan was to manipulate her way to the Trident but forgot to account for Prince Eric entering the equation and got stabbed for her efforts. Ratigan lost because even though he calculated every move Basil would make down to the time the Great Mouse Detective would arrive at his secret lair, coupled with the fact that he'd been beating Basil to the punch for years, Basil was able to match him and eventually best him. THAT is what a good villain does: he/she challenges and compliments the hero without compromising themselves as characters.With all that said, this movie isn't flawless. There is one scene that drags a bit where they have a tacked-on music number at a bar, but it doesn't last very long and it's pretty funny to watch after the shock of it wears off. But, despite that, I still call this the best Disney movie to date. It's message of intelligence and wit still holds up, its characters timeless and still very entertaining, its hero great, its villain great, and its villain song one of Disney's best. And THAT is why it's my favorite Disney animated movie."
19,The Great Mouse Detective,7,5 December 2010,"Holy cripes, I like this one.","By no means does it rank among the greatest Disney films. Its animation is mostly Saturday Morning level and its plot is as simplistic as a Sherlock Holmes knockoff story can get, complete with plotty, expository script and pretty typical archetypes throughout. Yet, it has something that has been missing in Disney movies for years: likability. It's lightweight, well crafted fun, like all the best Saturday morning cartoons, with inventive set pieces and terrific voice acting that helps make up for the fact that the losses incurred on The Black Cauldron show quite clearly. Unfortunately, it was shoveled under the hype over Don Bluth's An American Tail, a film that I have a bit of a soft spot for but which I'm not sure was that much better despite more involved animation. Of course it's no masterpiece, but it does deserve some appreciation for its virtues.The plot's rather simple, and a bit too dialogue driven. Basically, you can figure out what happens before you even see it. What makes it work are the personalities. True, Olivia's a bit cloying, but Basil himself is as manic and fun to watch as any good Holmes knockoff, due in no small part to Barrie Ingham's performance. However, the show stealer, like with many Disney films, is the villain, Professor Ratigan as brilliantly voiced by the great Vincent Price. What I love about his character is that he comes off a narcissistic buffoon most of the time, but when pushed he shows himself to be a ruthless maniac able to wring whatever he wants from people by sheer force. In many ways, he's the villain that Captain Hook should have been. He even gets one of the only song numbers in this movie, one of the finest villain numbers in its jaunty bombast and how it shifts to a dead stop when a henchman double crosses him then shifts back after a rather grim moment in the film.Unfortunately, one wishes the animation was better than Toon Disney on a production level. There's lots of conservative pose-to-pose stuff and very little in the ways of spontaneous character stuff. The angles are all very flat and straightforward. It especially shows in the dog character, who is much larger than the others but has too lightweight a feel to him. It's still a better looking film than The Black Cauldron, however less lavish it may be, and it has a few highlights. Ratigan, again, is superbly animated by Glen Keane, who gives him much more nuance and presence than the other characters. There's also a steep improvement toward the end, where Disney really ratchets up on some terrific set-piece direction. The CGI may show its age, but it's incorporated quite well. One also suspects that Disney first started to look at Hayao Miyazaki's work around this time, since there are more than a few similarities to the climax of Castle of Cagliostro.All in all, these elements, along with a great Henry Mancini score, add up to another overlooked gem of a Disney movie, if not an essential work. It's light nature makes it understandable that some people tend not to care for it, but I enjoy it like I do any decent childhood cartoon. For me, it's the best Disney picture between the end of the golden age in the 60s and the renaissance at the end of the 80s, despite not being especially ambitious or innovative. It's just good fun, and what more can one ask for?"
20,The Great Mouse Detective,7,29 June 2007,"Basil, the Sherlock Holmes of the mice world","The 26th animated Disney classic is one of the most unknown and underrated Disney classics. Yet, it has a big number of fans. Not everybody knows it (including many Disney fans themselves), but those who know it usually appreciate it. Very unlikely you'll find someone who dislikes this.""The Great Mouse Detective"" is often said to be the first animated Disney classic with animation by computer, but that title belongs to the earlier ""The Black Cauldron"".""The Great Mouse Detective"" is like a Sherlock Holmes mice version. Without being tremendous (far from that), it is enjoyable enough. Although it has nothing to do with ""The Rescuers"", it seems to have been somehow inspired by the idea and success of ""The Rescuers"", which encouraged them to ""repeat the formula"". While not as good as ""The Rescuers"", still this motion picture deserves some credit too.It never reached the popularity and classic status of most Disney classics and remains forgotten and unpopular after all these years - however, not as much as ""The Black Cauldron"".This movie is one of the darkest Disney cartoons and at the same time one of the funniest at times.Like most Disney classics, it has great characters, a good general quality job on details, wonderful animation, memorable songs, a cool story, adventure, danger, friendship, the main one might ask on a Disney animated movie...My favorite characters are Basil, Dr. David Q. Dawson, Felicia, Olivia and Toby. Why? Basil because he's wise, smart, confident and brave. Dr. Dawson because he is funny, simple and dabbler. Felicia because she is a funny character (especially when she nearly has Fidget for her dinner). Olivia because she's a cute and sweet little mouse. Toby because he's a cute and adorable dog. Both Olivia and Toby are more than cute characters - they're sweet, innocent, adorable and lovely.Professor Ratigan is the big villain of this movie. He's the ultimate Disney villain. He's very evil (like a villain should be), but at the same time he's got a huge sense of humor, he's sarcastic and creepy at times. However, most of the time he's hilariously evil.Fidget (the bat) is Ratigan's sidekick and helper. He's a comic relief and often abused by Ratigan.I perfectly understand why Ratigan was one of Vincent Price's favorite roles. Vincent Price does an amazing job as the voice of Ratigan.The soundtrack is another triumph of this movie. It has great songs such as Henry Mancini's instrumental opening theme, some beautiful classical music and the delightful Ratigan's song ""Goodbye So Soon"" (sung by Vincent Price himself), just to mention a few examples.This film takes place in London, in the year of 1897. London is a beautiful and very nice big city and it has some great scenes with the majestic Big Ben (outside and inside the Big Ben)."
21,The Great Mouse Detective,10,30 September 2007,"Oh, Ratigan!","This diamond in the rough, ""Robin Hood"" and ""Brave Little Toaster"" are, in my opinion the best post ""Bednobs and Broomsticks"" pre ""Little Mermaid"" films to come out in that time where Disney flicks were only nominated but didn't win any Oscars 'till ""Mermaid"". A lot of people have never heard of ""Great Mouse Detective"", but they really should watch it. Ratigan is one of my favourite Diney villains next to Frollo (""Hunchback of Notre Dame"") and Prince John (""Robin Hood). If it wasn't for this ""Little Mermaid"" would never of been made and thus the Disney renaissance would never of started so it really was THIS film that actually sparked it off.All in all go see this film- you won't be disappointed. Honest."
22,The Great Mouse Detective,9,13 August 2004,They used to make great movies like this.,"I was maybe five years old when I saw this movie for the first time, and it was just plain awesome. I think the only film made the last four or five years that can even be in the same area as this is Finding Nemo. Other than that, no other kid's film pulled it off. Other movies like Shrek and Shrek 2 are good, but with jokes kids can't understand easily. This movie was also good in that it used mystery, a genre not often used in children's' films.All the recent films have violence, blood, bad language, etc. and still have a pg rating, giving the illusion that it is still a movie fit for everybody. This movie has none of that, and is probably better than many of those that do. There is no reason not to like this movie, so if you haven't already, watch it!10 out of 10."
23,The Great Mouse Detective,10,31 January 2013,The best movie from Disney's dark era!,"With Walt Disney's death in 1966, and many of Disney's best animators gone (the nine old men either retired or died, and Don Bluth left with several other animators to open a competing studio), the Disney animation studio was going through hard times. They had a few good post-Walt stuff prior to the Disney Renaissance (like ""Robin Hood,"" ""The Rescuers"" and even ""The Fox and the Hound,"") but for the most part the magic seemed to be disappearing. It also didn't help that their ""The Black Cauldron"" (which didn't resemble a Disney animated film very much) was a major failure. So a smaller crew, featuring four directors (including Burny Mattinson of ""Mickey's Christmas Carol,"" and Ron Clements and John Musker, both of whom later went on to direct some memorable Disney animated features afterward), put together ""The Great Mouse Detective"" on a much smaller budget. Development took quite a while, but with the advancements on digital technology, the actual production only took a year! Also, it did very well at the box office and gained several positive reviews, which convinced Disney that their animated films had a future, and if it weren't for this film's success, we may not have had a Disney Renaissance! Aside from that, this is definitely Disney's best movie from their pre-Renaissance slump. You've got likable characters, great voice acting, a perfect music score (complete with theme tunes for each main character!), well-done animation and effects, and even a few songs for Disney tradition's sake! Vincent Price tends to steal the show with his excellent performance as Professor Ratigan (no wonder he got top billing!) I also enjoy Basil's ingenious thinking and over-the-top acting for a detective that can fit in the palm of your hand (I can't help but notice he almost looks like an anime character at times, the way he is designed.) Dr. Dawson and Olivia are also great characters, and Fidget is good at raging from downright creepy (his two horror-style jump-scare scenes) to your typical comical sidekick (what's not to love about a big-eyed one-legged bat that's unable to fly?) I also liked hearing Alan Young using his Scrooge McDuck voice for Mr. Flaversham. The songs are for the most part your standard Disney musical fare, but like I said, they're a lot of fun. Especially fun is Miss Kitty's ""Let Me Be Good to You"" musical number (that had to be a scene by Ron Clements and John Musker; they're known for crazy stuff like that, as seen in ""Aladdin"" and ""The Princess and the Frog!"") The animation also has a very classic look and feel to it, which is rare for a Disney movie of this era. It also uses computer animation much better than ""The Black Cauldron"" did, and the climactic scene at Big Ben was quite thrilling and enough to keep you at the edge of your seat! I guess you could say that not only did Basil and company save London, they also saved Disney's feature animation division!There's also a fun use of Basil Rathbone's vocal performance as Sherlock Holmes (from a record version of ""The Red-Headed League"") during a shadowed cameo of the REAL Sherlock Holmes. Fun stuff for the Holmes fans, too!"
24,The Great Mouse Detective,9,14 June 2006,Let Disney be good to you!,"I saw and loved this film as a child, I still love it as an adult. Me and my parents have sat down and watched this film on wet winter afternoons, it's so good. It's an old-fashioned mystery story, the fact that it's animated and about mice is a bonus! It's quite a sinister tale, but no scarier than Doctor Who. Not all the characters are pretty and clean like later Disney films, the villains actually look rough and mean. There are elements that adults will enjoy, like some of Basil's fastpaced dialogue, and the inimitable Vincent Price as the voice, and inspiration for the movements, of Ratigan.As many people have commented, the lack of songs in this film is really to it's credit. The musical score is excellent as it is, and the songs that do feature are brilliant. Ratigan's ""goodbye"" song is genius, and as a child I wanted to be the mouse girl who sings ""let me be good to you"". The whole bar scene is spot on, and another section that adults may appreciate more than the children.The animation has always been good enough for me, although there are a couple of syncing issues. The drawing style adds to the period feel of the film, after all, it is set in Victorian London.Overall this film is a little gem, and more films (animated or not) should be like this. It's witty, dramatic, and brilliantly directed. If only animators would still make films like this, that actually have some bite and aren't afraid to be rough with their characters. You'd never be able to get away with the song lyric ""worse than those widows and orphans you've drowned?"" nowadays.This is a much better film in my opinion than some later Disney films, or children's films of any kind. It's not about ""coming-of-age"" or ""being yourself"", it's a straightforward good vs evil tale of a rat who wants to take over the world and the mice trying to stop him. And it's fantastic."
25,The Great Mouse Detective,5,20 January 2013,An incredibly flawed film and just escapes from being average,"As we all know Disney was running through some difficult times through the late 70's and 80's. Their movies weren't incredibly original or interesting and The Great Mouse Detective happens to be one of their last mediocre films. However this movie did help Disney after the failure of the Black Cauldron. While the movie was mediocre it used some new technologies and helped the creation of newer/better Disney films. Now I know a lot of people who watched this movie as a kid love it and consider it a really good movie but let's take a step back and look at the movie for what it is.The movie follows a mouse detective named Basil who is trying to find a kidnapped toy maker. However this toy maker's daughter comes along with him as well as Basil's new assistant who plays the role of Watson from Sherlock Holmes. Basically Basil is trying to figure out what his nemesis Ratigan is up to and what kind of scheme he is hatching.The movie follows The Sherlock Holmes formula very closely and even makes many references to Sherlock Holmes which I thought was funny (Baker Street, Basil being named after the actor who portrayed Sherlock Holmes, a man in the window of 221 Baker Street playing a violin and others). Being a fan of Sherlock Holmes I have watched almost all of the original Sherlock TV shows. And honestly who doesn't like a good mystery? This is where the movie starts to have problems. There is no mystery.The movie pretends to be a detective movie but the problem is that the villain and his entire plan are revealed at the very beginning so there is no mystery. Younger audiences might take a couple minutes longer to figure out what Ratigan's plan is but it is still very obvious. Here is the next problem with the conflict: Ratigan is as cliché as cliché gets. We know nothing about Ratigan's motives, his back-story, his inner thoughts, or any development in his character other than being a villain. He is dull and one dimensional with no redeeming characteristics until the last two minutes of his life. One thing that really bothered me was his legs... he walks like a woman and his legs are always bent inward at such an incredible angle that it looks really awkward. Also he has a henchman/bat who is just embarrassing. It's a bat with a peg leg that always switches what foot it is on and he is simply a comedy relief.Now the main characters aren't all that bad. Basil is as interesting as any version of Sherlock Holmes. He doesn't do anything incredibly different from being another Sherlock Holmes other than him being a mouse. I have watched so much of Sherlock Holmes movies and TV shows it is hard to say that Basil is original or unique. People who haven't seen any Sherlock Holmes movies probably thought ""Wow he is so witty, clever, original and doesn't even have a love interest"" but actually his character has been so many times. Dawson is much like Watson but doesn't have as many redeeming features as Watson. The little girl who follows them around is named Olivia and she is pretty much your generic ""wide-eyed eight year old animated mouse"". She doesn't differentiate herself from the cliché character that she is which leads to another problem this movie has: it is incredibly cliché and just feels like another mouse movie. A lot of parents have probably noticed the rather mature aspects of this movie such as the suggestive themes at the bar and the violence in the movie. Honestly there isn't anything real bad about putting this kind of content in a kids' movie but what is bad is when it is poorly executed. The bar scene could've been from just about any movie that features are bar. It was cliché, generic, unoriginal, and had nothing to separate it from the large number of bar scenes in other movies. The movie does feature two songs: one extremely simplistic song about Ratigan praising himself and another incredibly simplistic song at the bar where a lady mouse is on stage and is singing about suggestive material. Both of these songs are overly simple, aren't catchy, and were very quickly produced due to their simplicity. Once again the movie proves to not be anything different from an average movie.There are a couple of good aspects about this movie. The soundtrack itself is not bad and is actually good at certain times. It has this nice vibe to it which I really liked. Also one thing that really surprised me about this movie is how dramatically the animation changed from the beginning to the end of the movie. The entire movie's animation is just standard but then the last several minutes of the movie (which are inside Big Ben) are excellently animated and look a lot more fluid and crisp. Probably the most important thing that this movie accomplished happened inside Big Ben and that is the use of CGI in an animated movie. This movie helped Disney incorporate CGI into a hand drawn movie to help make an incredibly complex scene. Also at the very end Ratigan FINALLY becomes threatening and interesting. In truth the ending is the reason why people even remember this movie.The Great Mouse Detective may not be a great Disney movie but it is important to Disney's history. It will definitely entertain kids who aren't looking for a character driven or original movie. Probably the main reason why this movie is so simplistic is because of its predecessor which is the Black Cauldron. Audiences didn't like the Black Cauldron due to it not being kid friendly or simplistic. So what does Disney do? They make an incredibly simplistic, linear, kid friendly, and unoriginal movie to capture the audience it lost. Thanks for reading."
26,The Great Mouse Detective,8,10 November 2012,"""The Great Mouse Detective: Mystery in the Mist Edition"" Blu-ray delivers the goods to Disney fans","""The Great Mouse Detective"" is based on Eve Titus's ""Basil of Baker Street"" book series. The movie paved the way for the Disney Renaissance of the 1990s. A great mix of adventure and humor makes this an entertaining homage to the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes.Master of Disguise and detective Basil of Baker Street lives under the home of his sleuthing hero, Sherlock Holmes. The sinister Professor Ratigan kidnaps the greatest toymaker in London to create a mechanical version of the Queen of Mice in a scheme to take over the country. Basil and his new sidekick Dawson embark on a rescue mission and must also find a way to stop Ratigan's evil plan.I recommend this for those who enjoy other hand-drawn films from the Mouse House and Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts."
27,The Great Mouse Detective,10,10 September 2011,It's Sherlock Holmes. With Animal's,"During the 80's, Disney was having a lot of trouble trying to make a good Disney film.Before, ""The Little Mermaid"", was released, Disney released an animated movie called, ""The Great Mouse Detective"". It became a critical and financial success.The movie is about a Toy Inventor who get's kidnapped, and the daughter of the Toy Inventor assist's help from Basil and his sidekick, David.Pro's: The film has some great animation and the story is original because it's just like, Sherlock Holmes, except with Mice. Also, the voice acting was great and it even has veteran actor, Vincent Price, as the villain, Dr. Ratigan.Overall, ""The Great Mouse Detective"", is a fun, animated movie and one of Disney's underrated movie's."
28,The Great Mouse Detective,9,28 December 2009,"as they say, fun for the whole family!","The Great Mouse Detective is a movie I'll revisit every several years or so. Not because for full-on nostalgia value (though I did enjoy it a lot as a child) and not even because it's one of the best Disney films (it's not). It's simply a fully entertaining vehicle for a Sherlock Holmes story, though meant to be based on 'other' stories not of Holmes though it clearly is, and with fantastic animation, funny gags and unexpected delights.One of the latter of these is Vincent Price. While no one in the cast of voice actors is bad at all, and it's a joy to hear Alan Young bring his Scottish Scrooge McDuck voice for the toymaker, they're overshadowed by the inimitable star/icon Price, who imbues Professor Ratigan- the arch nemesis of the hero Basil of Baker Street- with gravitas and cunning and some real moments of evil (i.e. his willingness to feed any of his minions who calls him a 'rat' fed to his cat). If nothing else, Price brings together young and old viewers, as older viewers will drool over his vocal intonations (particularly when he has his ""Goodbye"" record playing over Basil and Dodson stuck in the death trap), and kids will just find him cool in a villainous way.But it's not just Price that makes it a must-see; the animation for Great Mouse Detective is creative and fun, even making nice allusions to previous old-school Disney fare (the scene where Basil is investigating in the toy room reminds one of the puppets in Gepetto's workshop in Pinocchio, one of the toys here being Dumbo), and the directors, who would go on to make their best work with Aladdin some years later, have a great grasp of mixing solid laughs with a compelling adventure story. There's even some nifty early-era computer animation when Basil and Ratigan have their showdown inside of the clocktower.Great Mouse Detective realizes what makes good family entertainment- clean, yes, but with moments that aren't too stupid or talk down to any viewer- and for Sherlock Holmes fans it's a minor treat after so many years with the usual lot of Baker street characters. It's also perhaps the real turning point from the old guard of Disney fare (along with the Black Cauldron) into the modern renaissance of the early 90's."
29,The Great Mouse Detective,9,25 February 2009,Easily the best but most underrated of the 80s Disneys before Little Mermaid!,"This movie is an absolute delight from start to finish. My only complaint was that sometimes the animation was a little crude, making a few scenes upsetting to watch, like the kidnapping scene and when Felicia the cat eats the mouse. But a vast majority of the animation was wonderful. The three songs were absolutely wonderful, especially Criminal Mind, and I loved it that Vincent Price sang in the film. How unusual! The characters were also a delight, especially Ratigan,(truly Machiavellian) with a perfect performance from the master of horror, Vincent Price, no wonder it is considered as his favourite role because he seemed to be having a wonderful time with it. The highlight of the film was the scene in Big Ben, brilliant animation in that scene. Basil and Dawson had wonderful chemistry, and I did laugh a lot in the scene in the Toyshop. Olivia is so cute, and Fidget is an inspired henchman. What impressed me most was the mix of Sherlock Holmes characters, because Toby is in the best Holmes mystery, the Sign of Four, and Fidget was probably inspired by Jonathan Small (the man with the wooden leg), from the same mystery. I think Ratigan was like Moriaty, which was great to see. In conclusion a delightful film, with minor flaws, but still lots of fun. 9/10. Bethany Cox"
30,The Great Mouse Detective,10,31 December 2007,"Amazing movie, dark or not!","I don't care what anyone says. When I have kids, they will watch this movie, no matter what. I saw this at a very young age (I'm 17), and I never had nightmares, nor did I want to strip and dance provocatively. I was innocent, yes, but the songs and references present never affected me in any way. To me, it was a Disney movie to watch. I now understand the darker half of the story, but I still adore it to pieces.Basil is by far my favorite character, with Dawson and Ratigan tied for second. Basil's wit and intelligence are amazing and keep me watching for his next crazy scheme. Dawson is an impressive Watson to Basil's Holmes, and Ratigan makes a perfect villain. May Vincent Price rest in peace. :) The story is dark, unlike most Disney movies today, which is disappointing. I miss the old Disney. Those movies had good, solid stories to them and strong characters. Today's Disney is far too childish and irritating for me. I absolutely refuse to touch High School Musical, nor will I bother with the sequels to the classic movies. The sequels ruin the story and only serve as a moneymaker for the company. Disney Channel is a waste as well. By essentially replacing Toon Disney with this, they have killed everything I once knew and loved. The shows are terrible and worthless to me, but every young 12-year-old girl I come across is in love with them, and it sickens me. If today's generation of children is being raised on HSM, Hannah Montana, and Disney's direct-to-DVD sequels, I am disappointed and feel sorry for them.The characters are lovable, and as I've said before, the story is dark, but it keeps one interested. I see no reason for children not to be able to watch it. I don't care if the story is ""too inappropriate"". Look at the cartoons children watch. All that violence is just as prominent in the Disney movies as it is in Tom and Jerry and The Fairly Oddparents. The characters smoke, fight, and drink alcohol, but nobody cares. But show it to an individual today, and it begins a pointless protest about censorship and all the magic is terminated.It being an underrated and under-appreciated movie is saddening, but by introducing it to more children and people, it can become more well known and loved by generations to come.Ain't no way MY children will watch any of THAT stuff. Classic Disney all the way, baby! Rating: 10/10"
31,The Great Mouse Detective,9,2 July 2016,"With fun characters and solid musical numbers, The Great Mouse Detective surprises on it's 30th anniversary","In London, a toy maker named Flaversham gets captured by a bat with a one pegged leg named Fidget, while Olivia, the toy maker's daughter, searches for help. After meeting Dr. Dawson, they meet a detective known as Basil of Baker Street and after telling what happened, he deducts that the bat is working for his arch-nemesis, Professor Ratigan. The three set off to find some clues to find the nefarious criminal while Professor Ratigan is using the toy maker to rule all of London. Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker who would later direct ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"", ""Hercules"", ""Treasure Planet"", and ""The Princess and the Frog"". Released in July 2, 1986.When I was a kid, I remember watching this on video at my aunt's house. It was really interesting considering this was made by Disney. A few years later, I looked at the reception and understood why everyone loved it and now I'm one of those people. Now I still like The Lion King (a childhood favorite of mine that I grew up with), and many other Disney films, but this film does fell a bit underrated.There are so many good things about this film that really made it worth it. The story is superb. The idea of making a mouse version of Sherlock Holmes is executed really well. What also works is that it has mystery, suspense, and some fun to go along with it. The script is very well-written. The humor is really good and doesn't jar with the overall dark tone of the film. There are also some smart moments including the rivalry between Basil and Professor Ratigan, the chemistry between Basil and Dr. Dawson, and the final battle at Big Ben, which things get really intense and scary at the same time. The music score from Henry Mancini is really good. It mixes whimsy and sinister perfectly, forming a cohesive adventure. Also, the songs including ""The World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" and ""Let Me Be Good To You"" are really good. The melodies are perfect and the lyrics are fun.The best part about the film is the characters. Olivia Flaversham is adorable, Hiram Flaversham is really sympathetic after getting captured by Fidget, who also has some amusing moments as the funny, but also scary henchman and the other characters including the burlesque dancer at the bar Miss Kitty are enjoyable, but Basil and Professor Ratigan are the best characters in the entire film.Basil is a psychopathic detective with a heart of gold while Professor Ratigan is a funny, but at the same time terrifying. What makes them work is not only the voice actors Barrie Ingham and Vincent Price, but like I said before, their rivalry. Their ways of trying to outwit each other is worthwhile even in the final battle.If there's one thing I would point out that is while the animation is really good especially the visuals, there are some crude stuff in it that might me questionable, but that's my only nitpick.Overall, The Great Mouse Detective is not only underrated, but it does manage to be a really good version of Sherlock Holmes by taking the idea of the character and turning it into something fresh. Sure it got overshadowed by Don Bluth's An American Tail, but this along with that classic are really well-written animated mouse adventures. On it's 30th Anniversary, this receives a thumbs up from me and is really recommended to those who haven't seen it yet. :)"
32,The Great Mouse Detective,7,24 October 2015,The Great Mouse Detective,"I'd heard many great things about ""Basil, The Great Mouse Detective."" Having never seen it, I looked for it on YouTube and sure enough, I found it. What I got was an entertaining, charming little movie, so quintessentially British, on that fine bridge between the Dark Era of Disney and the Renaissance.""Great Mouse Detective"" is based on a series of children's books by Eve Titus and Paul Galdone, which are heavily inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""Sherlock Holmes"". Basil, the titular character, lives in Sherlock's house, for Basil is a mouse. The story starts out with a little mouse named Olivia (Susanne Pollatschek), whose father, renowned toymaker Mr Flaversham (Alan Young), is kidnapped by the evil henchman of Professor Ratigan (Vincent Price). Ratigan is planning to force Mr Flaversham into building a robot replica of the Mouse Queen (the Queen of England in mouse form), so he can fool the people into thinking he is the new ruler of the land. The real Mouse Queen, it is assumed, will be dealt with accordingly. Olivia, desperate to find her father, goes to the great Basil of Baker Street (Barrie Ingham), a charming, cocky little detective who is Ratigan's arch nemesis. Along with his accidental assistant, Dr Dawson (Val Bettin), Basil risks his whiskers in trying to save both Mr Flaversham, and the rodent population of London.The animation is flowing, the characters very expressive and likable. The protagonist is clever, vindictive and scatterbrained, but with a soft spot. One of the film's best scenes is where Basil believes he has been bested by Ratigan, and you can see how torn he is. It's a very relatable moment, and rather poignant. There is a Bassett Hound named Toby who acts like a regular dog, and is very funny and cute. The real treat however, is Ratigan. It was one of Price's dreams to be in a Disney film, and he is relishing every minute; Ratigan is easily the best character. He is so funny, so twisted, so smarmy. He loves being evil and knows his evilness has no bounds. His expressions are priceless, and it's no surprise he was animated by Glen Keane, who went on to animate the Beast and Marahute, the Golden Eagle from ""Rescuers Down Under"". The interactions between Ratigan and Basil are very good, and Basil is a very enjoyable character, but it's Ratigan who really steals the show.The best scene is the riveting climax inside Big Ben, where traditional animation and CGI are married perfectly to create an electrifying finale. ""GMD"" may not be as Great as Mousedom's greatest detective, but it's charming, good looking, and a lot of fun."
33,The Great Mouse Detective,8,14 October 2015,Way Underrated,"The movie begins in London, England in 1897, where a little (mouse) girl and her single, toymaker father are celebrating her birthday, when suddenly, the father is captured by a grotesque, peg-legged creature, leaving the girl crying in the streets. Luckily, she is noticed by Dawson, a mouse who happens to have contacts with Basil of Baker Street, a brilliant (mouse) detective who is at first not interested in the toymaker's capture, until it is linked to his arch-enemy, Ratigan!There are a few aspects of this film that REALLY stand out: Vincent Price as Ratigan, and Henry Mancini's score. To start the score is simply fantastic. Up there with freaking Star Wars fantastic. Next up, Good ol' Vincent Price, the original VP. His performance as the villain in this film is absolutely brilliant. It is unfortunately rare that a celebrity voice actor really becomes a character in the film, rather than just projecting his personality onto the character. And that is exactly what Vincent Price does here. But despite this, my favorite character is Basil. Why? Because he's a littoral psychopath! He displays all the symptoms. This doesn't make him unlikable, but it leaves lots of room for a satisfactory character arch. Overall, it is a shame this film isn't better known."
34,The Great Mouse Detective,,16 September 2015,Important film for Disney,"The Great Mouse Detective was a critical film for Disney Studios. The Black Cauldron has bombed spectacularly at the box offices, and the corporation was seriously considering closing down its entire animation department. Either The Great Mouse Detective proved that Disney could still produce some income through its films or the legacy of Disney films would have ended right there.Luckily, it did more than well and allowed the animation studio to stay open, which in turn led directly to the Disney Renaissance a few years later. Since then, it has become something of a forgotten Disney classic. It has its own fans, certainly, but most 90s kids tend to remember the Renaissance films over it, and for a good reason, given their quality. But this movie has a lot of good things going for it as well, and should be appreciated because of them.The greatest thing about the movie is no doubt its energy. It captures the mood of Sherlock Holmes's London perfectly and is overall a bouncing, fast-paced adventure to stop the evil Professor Ratigan - a rodent version of Moriarty, obviously. The film flows flawlessly and even the animation style has an excellent grasp of movement, fluidity and space.The characters are also a lot of fun, from quite honestly nutty Basil of Baker Street to Dr. Dawson to Hiram Flaversham, a genius toymaker utilized for his talents for nefarious purposes. Ratigan is also a great Disney villain, voiced by the great Vincent Price, who gives him a suave yet menacing purr.It's a great movie, all things considered. I wouldn't call one of the best Disney films, it's not quite there, but it's definitely one of the most important films in Disney's cinematic history. Absolutely worth a watch if you haven't seen it already."
35,The Great Mouse Detective,7,23 March 2015,Forgotten gem,"Under-appreciated is the best way to describe ""The Great Mouse Detective"" because you never hear mention of this movie. ""Renaissance"" this and ""Classic Disney"" that, but never this one. And it's a shame really, since this is a fun, well put-together flick. There's life to the animation (for a story told from a mouse's level, it's pretty good-looking), it makes good use of early CGI, and I really like the new spin on the subject matter while paying respect to earlier Sherlock Holmes adaptations. This is a real treat; good characters, dastardly plot and an outsized adventure.7/10"
36,The Great Mouse Detective,8,8 February 2015,The Great Disney Classic,"One of the most underrated films from Disney that never got the respect it deserves.The Great Mouse Detective is like Sherlock Holmes but as a mouse, making him the greatest detective of all moused om. It's such a shame that this film doesn't get much star treatment as it deserves because it is such a good film.The story centers around Basil of Baker Street (Voiced by Barrie Ingham) who is hired by Olivia Flaversham (Voiced by Susanne Pollatschek)to help find her father Hiram Flaversham (Voiced by Alan Young) Basil along with Dr.David Q.Dawson (Voiced by Val Bettin) begin the investigation against Professor Ratigan (Voiced by Vincent Price) who is the criminal mind behind the kidnapping of Olivia's father. This film is what I best know Vincent Price for and listening to performance in the film he was the right choice to voiced Professor Ratigan. Barrie Ingham sold the role of Basil very well his performance was like seeing a stage actor during a play he did a very good job as the Greatest Detective of Mousedom. The Great Mouse Detective had a lot going for it and of course it being a Disney animated film you would expect nothing less.Animation for this film is so well done with great background, the fog effect really helps tell the story of the film. And the water effects are very detail as well. Lighting and thunder is very well time.The Characters are very well animated and when you watch the film it feels like you're watching a play like the animators watch each actor during the recording sessions.The voice acting is very well done and the cast helps sold the story with their performances.The music is so well done I love the score that was written for the film it is some of the best work ever in animation. Another reason to watch the film because of the music helps sold the story of the film and can build up the next scene. The setting for each scene is like the classic detective story of Sherlock Holmes and all the famous detectives in fiction.The Great Mouse Detective is one of Disney's most underrated films in their collection of animated films but once you watch the film you will appreciate the story telling and animation along with clever voice acting with strong performances by Barrie and Vincent.The whole family will enjoy this classic film and it's one of my favorites as well.Do yourself a favor and check out this classic film.I give The Great Mouse Detective an 8 out of 10"
37,The Great Mouse Detective,9,26 July 2008,when's the next one coming out?!!,"Given the fact that the little mermaid, one of the most irritating of all movie characters, got two sequels, why haven't the animators at Disney brought out a sequel to the great mouse detective, one of the finest cartoon movies made? This is a great movie in the vein of the old classics like Pinocchio and others of that era. it brought back the drama and class so long missing from Disney's animation efforts, starting in the late 1980s. Basil is brilliant if absentminded. Dawson is performed in the tradition of Nigel Bruce: intelligent enough to study medicine, tough enough to serve in the military, yet, a buffoon outside his surgery (I've never understood that dichotomy in the popular portrayals of the character).Vincent Price is deliciously wicked as Ratigan (love the medals).I agree the movie is too short at 74 minutes. It's intelligent enough for adults to like it, so it could have been quite a bit longer without having parents fall asleep in the cinema.If there's a failing with the movie, it's that Basil doesn't actually solve the crime like Holmes does. He knows something is wrong and stops it, but he doesn't actually figure it out.I'm dying to see a sequel, but I'm wary that Disney would candy-coat it too much, as is their wont."
38,The Great Mouse Detective,9,8 November 2006,"Fidget, the best character . Anyone ??","this movie was damn good, i mean by gosh i remember watching it when i was a child (17 now) and used to have a ball with it then. my main man Fidget was damn hilarious in this movie i love the bat i wish he would have stared in some other movies, he was cracking me up the whole movie. i swear this has to be Disney's most underrated file in their archive this movie is well put together and i don't think u could make improvements on it. if they were to digitally remaster it they'd prolly take out the bar scene which was maybe the 2nd best scene in the movie. ( you guys see basil's face when fidget walked in ? fidget didn't even notice basil to busy enjoying the stripers LOL). but to top it the sad thing about this movie is that well Fidgets voice actor died a while back and i'll never get to hear that grunting voice again. i think Disney should re-release the film double DVD in his honor. its the least they could do"
39,The Great Mouse Detective,10,7 June 2006,It's Magic,"The Great Mouse Detective is from the creators of Aladdin and The Little Mermaid , which tells you it will be good.It is one of my favorite Disney movies . Even though , it seems to be a forgotten film , I will always remember it.The story starts out in London ,1987. Olivia, the daughter of a famous toymaker, turn to the very famous Basil of Baker Street for help when her father has been kidnapped.She also meets the lovable Dr. Dawson and Basil's loyal hound Toby , who will help them retrieve her father.It turns out the person who kidnapped him was the evil Professor Ratigan (voiced by Vincent Price), an evil street rat who wants to become the King of all Mousedom.My favorite parts are when Professor Ratigan decides to use all of his ways to kill Basil at the same time and when they are fighting on the Big Ben. This movie also has a remember able song called "" The World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" about Professor Ratigan.This movie is great . 8/10"
40,The Great Mouse Detective,10,21 February 2006,Disney's Finest,"Growing up, I watched a lot of Disney films, as most of us did. Though, even as a child, none of their movies really satisfied me. I thought the story was creative but that was all there was to push the movie along. I thought the music was so-so and the characters the same in each film. (With the exception of Scar.) Then while I was flipping through channels one day, I caught a glimpse of The Great Mouse Detective. I originally thought ""Oh no, not another stupid Disney movie."" I will admit the only reason I saw this movie at all was because of Vincent Price and Henry Mancini. Well one night I sat down and watched it and discovered this was the best Disney movie I had seen. The plot is simple enough for children to understand, yet an adult could easily sit through it. The music and acting is the best I've seen a in Disney film since Pirates of the Caribbean. Basil is the most human Disney hero I have ever seen because of his almost tepid behavior and yet can spring into action at the sound of Ratigan's name. It is also a milestone in film making being the first to use C.G. in an animated film. The villain is, for once, interesting. Vincent Price really brought this character to life and I rate Ratigan as one of the greatest villains in film history. And the lack of songs helps the flow of the movie. I rate it a 10 out of 10."
41,The Great Mouse Detective,10,18 January 2006,Pure Disney blockbuster,"THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, in my opinion, is a pure Disney blockbuster. It made me feel all warm and tingly when Basil (voice of Barrie Ingham) and Olivia (voice of Susanne Pollatschek) set out on their mission to rescue Hiram (voice of Alan Young). If you ask me, Professor Ratigan (voice of Vincent Price). To me, he really was a slimy, nefarious sewer rat. If I were Olivia, I'd probably do the same thing she did. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure Disney blockbuster to everyone who hasn't seen it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it."
42,The Great Mouse Detective,10,10 January 2001,Barrie Ingham is the best Holmes since Clive Merrison!,"Heehee, I guess that shows you what MY opinion is worth.  But at-any-rate, I loved the Great Mouse Detective, and contrary to one other reveiw, the animation was wonderful.  FELICIA and Ratigan were suppose to look like that. And the animation was done by hand, not computers (Except for the Big Ben scene), it looks very charming, not bad. :) Barrie Ingham, I thought, was wonderful as the Sherlock Holmes of the Mouse world.  Basil and Dawson are reminiscent of Clive Merrison and Michael Williams, and I think they did a wonderful job.  And Olivia, voiced by an actual little girl, was wonderful!  You seldom find a animated child so genuine as Olivia Flavisham, even if she was a mouse. Not that alot of it wasn't goofy and silly.  I mean, a dog's ear turns into a staircase, for goodness' sakes!  But it was funny in a way that adults and children will enjoy, not to mention Sherlock Holmes fans. :)  The mouse version is somewhat more likable then his human counterpart, but they are obviously made from the same stuff. Basil is obviously as energetic a detective, as in the first scene with him, when he runs in after finding a new clue.  He is also just as prone to depression, as when he found the new clue was just another dead end, and promplty flopped into his chair to play his violen.  And he has the same flare for a surprising ending, as when, instead of just running out and stopping Ratigan, he uses his own evil shceme against him first, just to surprise him!  (And the trap scene with Vince Price singing is priceless!)"
43,The Great Mouse Detective,7,2 November 1999,Watch for the mousetrap ...,"Disney Animation's technical standards had slipped alarmingly since `The Jungle Book' (1967).  I list just a few of the symptoms:*  Rattigan has such an unworkable character design that it's actually difficult to tell where his neck ends and his mouth begins.  When the animators make him speak it sometimes helps, but not always.*  The perspective on larger animals (especially Felicity) is simply wrong. Felicity looks fat, not large; and her folds of flab only serve to make her look less like a cat.*  Effects animation is done in an awkward Saturday morning TV style - watch the way the blue paint drips, for instance.*  Much else looks as if it belongs on TV.  Look at the springs on the robots.*  Dawson's fat sometimes looks like a latex costume he's wearing rather than a part of him. ... Et cetera.  After you watch this, take a look at `The Rescuers Down Under'.  It's another the-mice-beneath-our-feet film, released a mere four years later, but the animators - the very same animators - dazzle rather than stumble.  Amazing what a difference four years can make.  (Or compare `Snow White' with the Silly Symphonies of 1933.)So you need to view the visuals charitably.  I hasten to add that there are promising touches: Basil himself, for instance, is simply but skilfully drawn; and the computer-assisted finale inside Big Ben is a good deal more tasteful than, say, the Cave of Wonders in `Aladdin', even if it is out of place in a Sherlock Holmes pastiche.Abstracting away from the look, it's a charming film.  You can't go far wrong with Holmes pastiche.  Although the best moment, the scene well worth the price of admission even if you find the earlier parts of the film a trifle slow, owes nothing to Conan Doyle: it's the best parody of an escape from a villain's death trap you will ever see - and at least the villain who constructed THIS death trap had a sense of style.  I'm not joking when I say you should watch `The Great Mouse Detective' for this alone; but watch the rest for the easy-to-like Basil."
44,The Great Mouse Detective,9,21 November 2017,An Underrated Thrill Ride,"The first half of the 80s was not a great time for Disney, as their films were barely financial hits and they were even threatening to close down their animation facility. It wouldn't be until the new generation of artists at the studio gave us their second film, The Great Mouse Detective, based on the Basil of Baker Street book series. While it was beaten out by An American Tail the same year, it did well with critics and earned enough money to save Disney from bankruptcy, so at least we would get Roger Rabbit, The Disney Renaissance and more down the road. But how does this film hold up?The main story centers in Victorian London, England, where a little mouse named Olivia Flaversham has her toymaker father abducted by a peglegged bat. Along with Major David Q. Dawson, she seeks the aid of Basil of Baker Street, basically Sherlock Holmes as a mouse. The case expands as Basil uncovers the crime's link to a plot against the British crown from the notorious Professor Ratigan. Pretty simple concept, yet the movie finds a way to make it fun, interesting, and even heartwarming at times. For one, the characters are absolutely delightful, whether it be the arrogant yet quick witted, intelligent and bold Basil, to the kind hearted albeit absent minded Dawson, to the innocent and cute Olivia, to even the villain Ratigan.Speaking of Ratigan, he is one of my favorite Disney villains, especially with Vincent Price lending his voice and mannerisms to the character. Ratigan is a villain who may seem cunning and cheery at first, but it's clear that he is hiding his inner demons, and it's not until the end when he finally lets it out. If there's one thing I adore about a villain, it's one who adores being evil and just embraces it all. Granted, his sidekick Fidget is kind of annoying and rather pathetic, but whenever Basil is around Ratigan, that's when his hatred for Basil shines through and it creates such a maniacal albeit witty presence that's always delightful to watch.The animation for this film was actually made in a year to reduce costs along with the aid of computers, and needless to say, it looks great. Not only does it feature the same lovable character designs one would expect from a Disney film, but the character animation is upbeat visual eye candy, the gritty backgrounds of London really fit the setting, the effects are fun to watch, and the usage of CGI (specifically the clock tower cogs) is barely even noticeable it's that well made. The music score and villain songs done by Henry Mancini, Ellen Fitzhugh and Larry Grossman are fun to listen to, deliciously sinister, fast and suspenseful when needed, and even subtly emotional when need be. Although one song written and perfumed by Melissa Manchester is.....well, let's just say it almost got this movie a PG rating....yeah.So overall, The Great Mouse Detective is not only a massive improvement over The Black Cauldron (which came out a year earlier mind you), but it's simply a delightful, upbeat and often suspenseful feature filled with lovable characters, high stakes, solid fast paced animation, hearty laughs, a chipper soundtrack, and overall, a fun adventure. It's a shame this movie isn't as talked about as other Disney films, because this is a movie worth checking out whether you're a fan of Disney, animation, or even the book series that this was based on. Fievel may have taken their glory, but who's to say this film can't be adored either?"
45,The Great Mouse Detective,9,14 November 2017,A sadly forgotten masterpiece,"I can't believe how little I see this among Disney-fans and in Disney-related shops. It is sad, because the two main characters Basil and Ratigan are among their most enjoyable. As much as I love The Great Mouse Detective I must confess that aside from the amazing Big Ben climax the animation is not among the studio's greatest accomplishments, but that is a minor detail. Speaking of the climax, it really is among Disney's greatest. The way the music builds up, the perfectly rendered CG in the bell tower and Ratigan's degeneration into his true self is just suspenseful. Ratigan is also among the most underrated and enjoyable Disney villains, period! Vincent price just engulfs himself in this evil- doer who loves every single second of it. His little running gag about not wanting to be called a rat is hilarious. He is great! Basil's giant ego is also enjoyable. He and Ratigan play off one another with perfection. They are the focus of the story and that is also what it should be. There is not too many side characters who steal screen time. The Great Mouse Detective certainly does deserve more attention. Watch it and enjoy some great voice acting and a great climax."
46,The Great Mouse Detective,9,6 September 2017,So Cleverly Done,"In this movie, that most people have not seen, we are shown the great sophistication and creativity of the Disney studios. First of all, we are taken to a wonderful subculture, the world of rodents in the city of London. A young female mouse loses her father, a toy maker, and is left alone. She goes to the Sherlock Holmes of mice to get help. In the process, she is introduced to the dark underbelly of this culture, populated with the worst of the worst, including a Moriarty figure, Ratigan. As is the case with most Disney animated villains, his hiring practices leave something to be desired as he surrounds himself with useless ding dongs. This has an intricate plot and is quite captivating. A real plus is Ratigan, who is voiced by the inimitable Vincent Price."
47,The Great Mouse Detective,5,23 April 2017,"Basil, the Great Mouse Detective","I saw the VHS trailer for this Disney animation a good number of times as a child, but it took me years to get the opportunity to watch it, I was hoping it would be worth waiting for. Basically set in Victorian London, England, young Scottish mouse Olivia Flaversham (Susanne Pollatschek) is celebrating her birthday, when her toy maker father Hiram (DuckTales' Alan Young) is kidnapped by peg legged and crippled winged bat Fidget (Candy Candido). Olivia goes to find the famed Great Mouse Detective named Basil of Baker Street (Barrie Ingham), she gets lost, but she is found by mouse surgeon Dr. David Q. Dawson (Val Bettin), he escorts her to Basil's residence. Upon arrival, Basil has no interest, but as soon as Olivia mentions the bat that kidnapped her father, Basil realises the bat is a henchman for the villain he has been trying to arrest for years, Professor Ratigan (Vincent Price). It is revealed Hiram has been kidnapped by Professor Ratigan to create a mechanical mimic of the Queen of the Mice so that the Professor can rule England as ""supreme ruler of all mousedom"", Hiram reluctantly agrees, when Olivia is threatened to be harmed. Basil, Dr. Dawson and Olivia begin to follow the trail for Hiram, finding Fidget's footprints, and using Sherlock Holmes's pet Basset Hound, Toby (Frank Welker), to track the bat's scent, they find him in a toy shop stealing various clockwork mechanisms and toy soldier uniforms. Before escaping, Fidget is able to ambush and kidnap Olivia, Basil is able to deduce from finding Fidget's checklist that he dropped that Ratigan's headquarters are located somewhere on a riverfront near the Thames, so they go disguised as sailors to find it. Basil and Dawson are caught and tied up in a mousetrap, with many components laid out to kill them both, while Ratigan sets out for Buckingham Palace, where Fidget and Ratigan's accomplices kidnap the Queen (Eve Brenner), with the clockwork operated Queen mimic taking to the stage. Basil finds a weakness in the trap, and is able to spring himself and Dawson out, the mechanical Queen proclaims Ratigan as the new ruler, but Basil and Dawson arrive in time to save Hiram, Olivia and the real Queen. Basil seizes control of the clockwork Queen, denouncing Ratigan as a fraud, before breaking into pieces, enraged by the treason, the crowd start a fight, but Ratigan is able to escape in his dirigible, with Fidget, and taking Olivia hostage, Basil, Dawson, and Hiram follow in a craft made with a craft with a matchbox and some balloons. Fidget is thrown out to lighten the weight, Basil jumps on the dirigible and causes Ratigan to crash into the Big Ben clock tower, Basil and Ratigan fight, Olivia is rescued, Ratigan is defeated when Big Ben strikes ten and causes him to fall to his death. In the end the Flavershams leave to catch their train, while back in Baker Street, Basil is given a new case to solve, he mentions Dawson as his trusted associate, they agree to form a partnership. Also starring Barrie Ingham as Bartholomew and Diana Chesney as Mrs. Judson. Price is notable and a good choice as the master scoundrel, it is very simply Sherlock Holmes with rodents, sounds like a charming idea, it does have good animation, but the story is a little predictable and not all the jokes strike the right cord, but it is certainly fun enough for the family to enjoy, a reasonable animated mystery comedy. Worth watching!"
48,The Great Mouse Detective,7,13 June 2016,"Elementary, my dear Dawson. Let the Great Mouse Detective be good to you! I think, you would like this cartoon movie!","In 1986, Disney released this film with much success. The movie was based on the children's book series, 'Basil of Baker Street' by Eve Titus, which in return, draws heavily on the character of Sherlock Holmes by author, Arthur Conan Doyle and the 1930s/1940s film series, that star Basil Rathbone as the iconic character and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. Directed by four directors, Ron Clements, Burny Mattinson, David Michener, & John Musker, the film set in 19th century, Victorian London, tells the story of a anthropomorphic mouse detective, Basil (Voiced by Barrie Ingham) & his associate, Major Dr. David Q. Dawson (Voiced by Val Bettin) on their quest to find a missing girl's parents, while uncovering a master plan by their arch-enemy, Professor Ratigan (Voiced by Vincent Price) to overthrow the British monarchy. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the idea of a toymaker, being apparently capable of building a life-size mechanical figure in the space of a few days is a bit, unrealistic, but it's something that you have suspense your disbelief about. Another thing is, how there are a few differences between Basil in the book series and in the film version, such as mood swings, the musical instrument in which he plays, and the type of animal that Basil's enemy is. One of the biggest changes, during production was the character of Olivia Flaversham (Voiced by Susanne Pollatschek), who was originally intended to be older and a love-interest, before it was decided that she should be a child to appeal to kids. I think, the decision to turn her into a child, gave the movie, so much, more weight, as it allow, Basil to become a well-rounded person, than a selfish-driven moody jerk, like Holmes was. I also like, how while, Basil and Dawson were visually based on actor, Rathbone and Bruce's version of the Holmes & Watson; their voices and personalities were not. Basil's voice was based on Leslie Howard's portrayal of Henry Higgins in the 1938 film, 'Pygmalion' while Dawson's voice was based on Disney animation legend, Eric Larson. Ingham was a great choice for Basil, as he was able to show the incredibly expressive, hyperactive unless quite visibly depressed, always overdramatic side of Basil. The actor was also known to give dramatic hand gesturing when speaking, allowing the animators to have a lots of raw film material to work with! In fact, even Vincent Price was the same. Price's every word as the dastardly Ratigan is delightful deliciously and his singing voice wasn't half-bad. By far, the music in this film are some of the best, Disney has ever produce. Songs like 'The World's Greatest Criminal Mind', 'Let me be good to you' and 'Goodbye, So Soon' are wonderful. Even the background music by composter Henry Mancini was amazing to hear. It has that epic adventurous tone to it. Another thing that I love, about this film is the humor, both in slapstick and its clever use of language and film/novel references. All the scenes between Basil, Dawson and Olivia, together, had this charm with them. I love the running gag of Basil's mispronouncing Olivia's last name. It was very funny. I also love, the fact, for a G-rated movie, this movie has gotten away with a lot of PG and even a bit of PG-13 material, with its sex appeal. Ask anybody, what was the most appealing part about this film, and some of them, would mention, the stripping mouse named Miss Kitty (Voiced by Melissa Manchester). It's surely left an impact on me. Talk about having a boner for a furry character. Another thing, good about this film is the intense action. The toy store and the clock-tower sequences, are some of the best action scenes, I have ever seen in a Disney movie. I also like how the city of London plays as a big a role in the plot as any of the characters. Because of things like that, I found the film to be, well done, despite the film, having a troublesome production. After the box office failure of the 1985's 'The Black Cauldron', the future of Disney animation department was in financial trouble. In the interest of saving what he believed to be the studio's core business, co-owner Roy E. Disney persuaded then CEO Michael Eisner to let him supervise the animation department in the hopes of improving its affluences. With the help of Eisner and film studio executive, Jeffrey Katzenberg, they somewhat did, with some very controversial choices. One of their roles, was to removed, the two animators that create the last bomb, Ron Clement & John Musker from this film and had them on other works. Second off, they had to cut the film's budget in half in order to save the film from being shelfed. They did this, by allowing the much-cheaper computer animation into the climax of the film, to cut the cost of hand-drawn animation & shorten the production schedule and multiple story rewrites. Most of their ideas kinda work. Others, maybe not too much, like the studio's decision to name the film, 'The Great Mouse Detective' and not 'Basil of Baker Street', because he felt that Basil sounded too English. The name change earned a good deal of scorn and infamy, even from inside the studio. The results of it, set off a chain of events that left the company's odd decisions, to be immortalized in a famous January 1987 episode of game-show, 'Jeopardy!' where it was highly mock. It didn't help that the movie was overshadowed at the box office at the time, by Don Bluth's 1986's 'An American Tail'. It would take years for Disney to recover from that. Overall: While, this movie was made during the company's dark period. I have to say, this 26th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics, is an underrated classic that needs to be watch, a lot more than it's been getting. So go see it."
49,The Great Mouse Detective,5,30 March 2016,One of Disney's better efforts,"A Disney cartoon which retells the exploits of Sherlock Holmes...as a mouse? It's fair to say that it's the type of premise that doesn't really get me very excited - I despise Disney movies on the whole - but nonetheless the starring voice performance of one Vincent Price, who described this as one of his favourite roles, got me watching it anyway.And if I'm honest, I only watched this for Price. He gets plenty of screen time and even sings a little along the way. Plus, he puts on an different voice too, so only occasionally do you hear flashes of the famous voice we all know and love. Price is melodramatic, flamboyant, and a lot of fun. I don't think this production as a whole would have been the same without him.Elsewhere, we get the usual Disney type production: lots of action, derring-do, and professional animation. Barrie Ingham's lead manages to successfully capture some of the qualities of the literary Holmes, so you could do worse."
50,The Great Mouse Detective,6,2 January 2016,Seek it out!,"No doubt one of Disney's lesser works, but still a fun ride... With lots of cute critters engaging in a surprising amount of drinking and gunplay, not to mention Vincent Price as the nefarious Professor Ratigan (just don't call him a rat).Ever-so-slightly inspired by Sherlock Holmes, there's also a great climax on board Big Ben, an inventor voiced by the same dude who does Scrooge McDuck, and even an appearance from Basil's loyal assistant Dawson! (Not a typo).So, despite what the packaging would have you believe, NOT a classic, but is it worth watching?Elementary, my dear reader. 6/10"
51,The Great Mouse Detective,8,7 August 2015,Exciting little detective movie from Disney!,"Disney's 26th animated full-length feature film takes us on a fun-filled adventure as we follow Basil, the mouse Sherlock Holmes, in investigating the kidnapping of toy-maker Hiram Flaversham committed by his archenemy, Professor Ratigan. From start to finish, the plot is well-paced and full of excitement, from the good guy vs. bad guy tangling in the human toy shop to Basil and his associates attempting to foil Ratigan's sinister plans against the Queen.Each character is fleshed out well, each showing humane traits with touches of humor, drama, sadness and heroism; I especially liked Dr. Dawson's commitment in helping Olivia get through to Basil in order to save her kidnapped father. Basil, I thought, was a little too indifferent at first, especially toward Olivia. In addition, Professor Ratigan has proved to be a nefarious and sinister character with a power-hungry mind and cold-stoned heart, a villain you would love to root against.The animation is great and colorful and the voice talents were spot on; I especially liked Alan Young lending his voice to Hiram Flaversham as it reminded me of his Scrooge McDuck character, which he also voiced in various Disney cartoons and shows.Overall, it's a good little detective movie that should delight an audience of all ages.Grade B+"
52,The Great Mouse Detective,10,14 November 2014,Underrated gem from Disney,"It might not be as well known as some of Disney's other animated movies, but this ranks up there with the best of them. Rather than functioning as a movie musical, this is a straightforward story with a few musical interludes and it suits the story just fine. It's based off a series of children's books, which were themselves inspired by the Sherlock Holmes novels. The inspiration is made quite clear, and it was very fun to recognize all of the little homages/in-jokes/references to those classic stories. The main character is Basil of Baker Street (complete name Basil Rathbone, which is a reference to one of the many actors who portrayed Holmes on screen), but the story is narrated by Dr. Dawson (equivalent to Watson). It concerns a toymaker who is kidnapped by the villainous Professor Ratigan (equivalent of Professor Moriarty), and his daughter enlists the help of Basil to help find him and stop whatever nefarious plan Ratigan is up to. Along the way, Basil and Dawson come to become great friends and kick off the partnership which their live action counterparts are so famous for. Overall, I thought this was very well written and animated. There are some great set-pieces and two really good show tunes. The first one is a song about the villain, Ratigan, and regales the audience with exploits that show just how bad of a character he really is. The second takes place in a seedy riverfront bar, and actually shocked me by how suggestive it was for being in a G-rated kids movie. It sounded like something that could have come out of a Kander/Ebb musical. And one of the action highlights is a balloon chase across London's skyline with a climactic showdown in/on Big Ben. So, for a good time with a Disney movie you probably haven't seen yet, you can't go wrong with this one."
53,The Great Mouse Detective,7,10 October 2014,An overrated entertainment,"I have a feeling that I've watched this film at a very very early age, but I'm not quite sure since I was watching a lot of Disney films at the time (I think) and it had to be a very short scene of it... Basil looks kind of familiar.This very entertaining surprise shows a small mouse named Olivia that gets her father, Professor Ratigan kidnapped on her birthday and her father! Dawson finds her crying inside a shoe, lost. So he helps her.Now this is where the entertaining part starts, Olivia convinces Basil to help her search for her father. I thought I'd really like it but the ending when Basil almost dies and then Olivia cries was somewhat poor. But that's probably because I really loved Basil and I was shocked to see him falling like that! The film, while being quite forgettable is actually somewhat memorable!Olivia is a little too naive though. But the rest of the cast is pretty great! And the voice acting fitted them perfectly, yet you'll fall in love with them!I also fell in love with the cinematography, art, and animation! It's all top-notch!I don't like mysteries but this film managed to engage me! I think it's entertaining for all ages! You would like this is you like comedies."
54,The Great Mouse Detective,2,10 February 2010,"And so ends the short, undistinguished career of Basil of Baker Street...","I waited almost 25 years to see this movie, thinking it might be an underrated work, from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been. It starred one of the best film villains of all time, was based on a beloved series of children's books, and was a Disney Studios production. What could possibly be wrong with it? As it turns outs, almost everything.Well, not everything. Vincent Price as Rattigan and Henry Mancini's swanky score are the movie's two saving graces. Price is wickedly enjoyable, and Mancini more professional than the material deserves. They bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity. Meanwhile the rest of the movie, while filled with inappropriately adult situations, still suffers from a completely dull script, blandly generic voice work, terrible songs, and lazy animation that wouldn't have been out of place on any of Disney's mid-1980s Saturday morning TV shows.This was a complete disappointment to me. It's amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. Costing a fraction of this, an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD has in its endless running time.The extra star that keeps this from being ""awful"" goes to Price and Mancini."
55,The Great Mouse Detective,7,10 June 2005,Creepy...,"This is probably one of Disney's most disturbing films. As a child the villains scared me horribly. I shied away from the film for years claiming to absolutely hate it, yet finally succumbed to watching it again couple months back.The mousy take on Sherlock Holmes is clever and cute and the premise is simple and oh-so Disney. Still, though, at 18 years old, I was creeped out by the villains. Maybe it was the drab settings that added a level of uneasiness or Ratigan's smoky voice and queer-eye personality. In fact, with the exception of Dawson, all the characters were real drama queens. Maybe that is just the English.Any way, this drably colorful almost classic Disney film is more suited for older children. It's still fun though. Check it out."
56,The Great Mouse Detective,9,14 May 2010,Something even Conan Doyle could be Proud of,"In this Disney dress-up of mice and rats as the characters of Sherlock Holmes lore, it is quite a story. What better to play Homes and Watson, than mice, like the one that started it all, Mickey! Disney has proved that it works again, after The Rescuers, children are still flocking to see this film today, and with the inception of DVD, it is a lot easier.The story is set during the reign of Queen Victoria, where a political coup by Ratigan is commencing to replace the queen with a Manchurian-like robot to make his ideas and opinions into law. Basil and Watson must save the day and the inventor of the robot, Flaversham with the help of Olivia Flaversham, the inventor's precocious daughter. In the end, it is after all a Disney film, and ends like Disney films do, happily. This film is creme of the crop with 9/10."
57,The Great Mouse Detective,6,3 January 2008,"THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE (Ron Clements, Burny Mattinson, Dave Michener and John Musker, 1986) **1/2","I recall this being released, but I had missed out on it back then; consequently, I'd been looking forward to catching up with it ever since  in view of the subject matter and the distinctive vocal involvement of horror icon Vincent Price in the role of the fiendish Professor Rattigan (it's ironic, then, that when I finally watched it, his voice was dubbed in Italian!). Anyway, while it was generally engaging and mercifully involved only a handful of songs, I was somewhat let down by it: being only 74 minutes long, the plot was too slight  and obvious  to generate the requisite suspense (still, the way it integrated the kidnapping of a toymaker with Rattigan's intended takeover of the British monarchy was cleverly done).While the classic Disney animation style is seldom in evidence (the visuals being flat overall when they should have been stylized), the studio's penchant for anthropomorphized characters is well up to par. Basil and Dr. Dawson are close enough, at least, to Hollywood's typical conception of Conan Doyle's creations (with the sleuthing rodent using logical ingenuity when cornered by his arch-nemesis and even adopting eccentric disguise during his investigation). However, much of the proceedings are stolen by Basil's amiable hound and Rattigan's absent-minded bat; the climax involving Big Ben, then, proves to be satisfactorily exciting."
58,The Great Mouse Detective,10,8 August 2004,This Movie Rules!,"I love The Great Mouse Detective!(A word of warning: There's spoilers up ahead.)Olivia is the most adorable Disney mouse child you'll ever see! Perhaps the ONLY one!The animation is quick & fast-paced, which is very appropriate for a fast-paced Disney film.(Despite the various mistakes in animation....)The characters are well portrayed, even the minor ones. No wonder Bartholomew got most of the screen time in ""The World's Greatest Criminal Mind""!The songs are very entertaining & catchy, especially ""The World's Greatest Criminal Mind"" & my personal favorite, ""Let Me Be Good To You"".The music is very thrilling. Henry Mancini was the perfect guy to do the score!Vincent Price's job as the funny, flamboyant, frightening villain Professor Ratigan is excellent! No wonder Ratigan was Price's favorite role!And the Big Ben Chase at the end of the movie is so thrilling, & frightening, & climactic! One of the best scenes in the whole bloody movie!All in all, this gem is one of Disney's classics. One the whole family can enjoy."
59,The Great Mouse Detective,6,20 November 2003,From Disney's weaker period and it shows,"The Great Mouse Detective is from Disney's weaker period, which started somewhere after The Jungle Book (1967) and ended with The Little Mermaid (1989). During that period Disney just was not able to make any of those famous Disney animated classics. This animated feature, though very short, does not entertain too much. The beginning is just too slow, the main villain not good enough and there are not enough laughs. The funny thing with this film was however, that when it finally got interesting and had enough momentum to keep me interested and entertained, it ended. Concluding, I would say that this is not a film for grown ups, but I know I loved the comic book about The Great Mouse Detective when I was a child, so maybe this one will entertain your child(ren). If you're going to sit and watch a film with your kid(s), I'd chose another film though.
6 out of 10"
60,The Great Mouse Detective,10,13 September 2012,"Basil, The Great Mouse Detective","My favourite Disney animated movie. Unlike much of Disney's output, this is one for the boys. There's only so much of that princess crap a guy can take. Basil is pretty much the mouse world's Sherlock Holmes. He's a genius, arrogant and a bit emotionally disconnected from other mice. However, he leaps at the chance to rescue a young girl's father when he discovers it might lead to his arch nemesis. Professor Ratigan is probably the greatest Disney villain. Voiced to utter perfection by Vincent Price. Ratigan has it all. The charm, the humour, the incessant unstoppable drive, not to mention he's blooming terrifying when he's angry. The dark stages, characters and events make it all the more enjoyable. Fidget is a twisted creation and causes a jump every time he shoves his face at the camera. Great action, great humour and the most goosebumpily climax in any Disney film."
61,The Great Mouse Detective,10,22 August 2012,"Such a great, under-rated take on the tale of Sherlock Holmes!","This is an absolutely brilliant film. The voice acting is pitch perfect for the characters (including the late, great Vincent Price as Professor Ratigan, the rodent version of (SPOILERS) Holmes' archenemy Moriarty), and the dialogue is brilliant.Even though I was born 12 years after the film was originally released in theaters, The Great Mouse Detective has become one of my all-time favorite Disney movies. This film helped introduce me to the world of Sherlock Holmes. (I'm now a seasoned Sherlockian...) The only bad thing I can say about this film is that Basil's lab gave me unrealistic expectations about high school chemistry. :)"
62,The Great Mouse Detective,8,11 December 2011,Really liked it...,"This is one of those movies which mimics a classic story, in this case Sherlock Holmes and the detective stories. I enjoyed watching as the detective rat/mouse figured out the problems using ideas that Sherlock would know of. Being able to tell where someone came from by looking at them, being able to figure things out nearly instantly such as the near death scene, yet showing that he has emotions and is human like the rest of us.Some scenes I'm surprised they showed, such as the semi-stripper scene with the female rat on stage at the bar. And the few references to smoking and apparently there was the F-word somewhere in there? But all in all I really enjoyed the movie, very impressed with the ending and how it ended up... enjoyed the movie in general and glad I was able to watch it!Rated 8/10."
63,The Great Mouse Detective,8,1 January 2007,Professor Ratigan is the greatest Disney baddie ever!,"Loved it ever since I was little and I'm annoyed that hardly any of my friends have seen in. If there was more media attention to it it would be more of a classic. I loved it because it was fun and yet with all of Basil's scientific methods, it treats you like an adult. I also like the fact that it sticks to the plot and has no silly sub-plot to follow. Like that there is no soppy love interest too. Only thing that is annoying is that it is a really short film and I wish it was longer. I adore all of the characters and you cannot hate any of them, unlike some Disney's (Cinderella for example. She is so pathetic. Belle from Beauty and the Beast rocks so much more...anyway). Completely idolised Professor Ratigan when I was like 5. Is that wrong?"
64,The Great Mouse Detective,8,4 May 2006,Good movie but the ending is a bit rough,"As others have stated, this is one underrated animated film. Disney went all out in this take on the Sherlock Holmes legend and the resulting film is thoroughly entertaining. Barrie Ingham is highly effective as ""Basil of Baker Street,"" the character of which the title refers, but the show belongs to Vincent Price's ""Professor Ratigan."" Price's legendary hamminess is perfect as the villain and the two songs that he sings are (forgive the pun) PRICELESS.The sole complaint, and it's a slight warning, is the end battle between the detective and Ratigan. Prior to their confrontation amongst the gears of Big Ben, Ratigan was seen more as a comic villain. However, when his rage gets the best of him and he disrobes his outer clothing, he becomes a bloodthirsty killer, bent on the total destruction of Basil.This change in the character may be a bit frightening to the smaller members of the audience and adults/parents should be forewarned."
65,The Great Mouse Detective,4,25 July 2006,forget sexual symbolism-here they spell it our for you,"While I really enjoyed this movie as a child I was never aware of the sexual connotations the movie had to offer until I watched it recently with a niece of mine. Yes it's creepy, yes it's violent, but what really bothered me was the scene when ""Let Me Be Good To You"" is being performed. The lyrics are beyond sexually suggestive especially when the singer and her back up dancers yank off their skirts in cue with the song; the entire scene encourages a lifestyle that should be reserved for adults. They are glamorizing a scene that in real life is rife with drug and domestic abuse. What parent wants their daughter to become a bar singer/go-go dancer? While processing this whole new light on the scene I got a flashback from my own child hood where I ran around in a ballet leotard and skirt, singing that exact song around the house, while trying to strategically pull my clothes off. My mother caught me and wanted to know where I got this particular idea of fun, and suddenly my copy of Great Mouse Detective was ""left at Grandma's"" two states away. When there's anything subliminal in any Disney film the whole nation practically boycotts, so why is blatant prostitution acceptable in the same format? Dearest friends, dear gentlemen Listen to my song Life down here's been hard for you Life has made you strong Let me lift the mood With my attitudeHey fellas The time is right Get ready Tonight's the night Boys, what you're hopin' for will come true Let me be good to youYou tough guys You're feelin' all alone You rough guys The best o' you sailors and bums All o' my chums So dream on And drink your beer Get cozy Your baby's here You won't be misunderstood Let me be good to youHey fellas I'll take off all my blues Hey fellas There's nothing' I won't do Just for you So dream on And drink your beer Get cozy Your baby's here Hey boys, I'm talking' to you Your baby's gonna come throughLet me be good to you Yeah!"
66,The Great Mouse Detective,6,9 December 2002,It's no mystery: This movie's not that popular because this movie's not that great.,"It's really is not worth the effort to write too much on this less then stellar Disney film. I checked it out after I heard it was the first film Disney used computer assistance on. And I must say for that scene it was some nice eye candy. Other then that, the animation for the most part seemed like a Saturday morning special. It didn't have that big budget Disney pizzazz we've all grown to love. Story wise I found myself board by a dull plot. The main guy `Basil of Baker Street' didn't seam all that motivated. Bevis and Butthead had more purpose searching for a TV in their movie then this mouse does looking for a kidnapped girl. The dialog between the characters could have been better too. It seemed like every one knew each other but they didn't seam to really have relationships and personal history. Even when they tell you (the audience) what they've done in the past. You just couldn't feel it.I give this an average rating of 6 out of 10. The computer sequence showing off the inner workings to London's Big Ben boosted it up from a 5. That and an interesting scene involving a mouse trap, some rope, a cross bow, a record player, a pistol, an anvil, and a hatchet.If you're looking for a Disney film to watch with friends and family stick to the classics (pre ""Aristocats"") or everything after ""The Little Mermaid"". Disney has been criticized for the movies they released during the 80's. `The Great Mouse Detective`is a perfect example why."
67,The Great Mouse Detective,6,6 December 2008,The Not-So-Great Mouse Detective,"if you have kids, sure, show them this movie. if they have a particular fondness for mice, they will probably love it a lot even though it's kind of scary, take it to kindergarten for show-and-tell, and then watch it ten years later and be reminiscing-ly... dissatisfied.first: the plot. of course children's movies are expected to be simplistic, but can we really believe, even in a world filled with ""mouse detectives,"" that not only could said investigator unravel a nefarious plot in under two days, but that the nefarious villain could even pull something so complex off in such short a time-frame? really, guys. put in some fades and let it span a week. and the story isn't even that ""great"" in the first place (where's the character development's motivation, eh?)...second: the music. music equals emotional undertones, right? umm, not for this movie. the soundtrack was entirely Indiana Rodent adventure tunes, which struck a wrong ""chord"" when juxtaposed with scenes of kidnapping and general dismay. maybe Henry Mancini as the composer wasn't such a great choice.third: sound in general. there was no ambient noise! I know this isn't something that should matter that much in cartoons, but with the Pixar-quality of kids' movies lately, it was kind of distressing. the only sound in the movie was dialog, soundtrack, and scarce sound-effects. foot-prints and the characters interacting with objects, etc., had no accompanying sound to convince me of their realism.also, the animation wasn't really that great.and with that, if you still do decide to watch this movie -- or if you just let your kids -- then please note some alarming racial/sexist undertones, and have a nice, motherly/fatherly chat afterwards."
68,The Great Mouse Detective,,25 July 2004,Too dark for a Disney movie...,"(SPOILERS) ""The Great Mouse Detective"" is one of the best Disney movies out there, but if you ask me, it is way too scary for kids. Believe me, I know. I saw this when I was four. I wanted to see this movie when I saw the movie cover in the video store, so my grandma rented it for me. Within the first few minutes, I was scared out of my mind. We see a father (Mr. Flaversham) making a toy with his daughter (Olivia), when the shadow of a bat is seen creeping up to the house with this creepy bubbly laugh. The window starts shaking, and his head busts through with an evil, demonic face staring straight at the camera. This image haunted my dreams for a while. I wanted to finish the movie, and realized that the bat was actually quite funny...until we see him pop out at Olivia with that demonic face again. AAH! The whole movie itself was very good though. There is one scene in particular that is very mature for a G-Rated Disney movie: Basil is seen smoking in a bar, while other mice drink beer and watch an exotic dancer (no sex or nudity, though). The end was absolutely fantastic: Ratigan (wonderfully played by Vincent Price) and Basil fight atop the Big Ben, as Ratigan sort of turns into a more sinister looking rat with sharp claws and teeth. This movie may be a bit scary for young kids (It sure was for me!), but I'd say give it a go. This is one of Disney's most underrated movies. 8/10."
69,The Great Mouse Detective,,14 April 2004,Routine Disney film from the studio's lesser period.,"The 70s and 80s were a low period for Disney animated films, with many routine productions that failed to reach the high standard set by the earlier classics. The last really splendid Disney cartoon was probably The Aristocats, and it wasn't until The Little Mermaid and Beauty & The Beast that the studio rediscovered its midas touch. Basil The Great Mouse Detective is an enjoyable but forgettable mid-80s offering from the Disney folks. Its biggest asset is the marvellous voicing (by the legendary Vincent Price) of bad guy Professor Rattigan; its worst point is the dull and uneventful opening stretch of about 25 minutes or so. The story is essentially a mouse version of the Sherlock Holmes yarns. A young girl-mouse, Olivia Flaversham, goes to the house of Basil of Baker Street (a renowned mouse-detective) and asks him for assistance in rescuing her father. Poor old Mr Flaversham, a talented toymaker, has been kidnapped by a master-criminal named Professor Rattigan. Rattigan plans to terrorise the toymaker into designing a life-like, walking, talking model of the Queen, which will help him to fulfil his evil scheme of becoming the new ruler of all mousedom. Basil, aided by a stout ex-army mouse, Dr Dawson, is the only person who can thwart Rattigan's rotten plot. In spite of the rather slow start, the film builds to a reasonably exciting climax. The animation is pretty good throughout, and Henry Mancini provides a lively and memorable music score. Barrie Ingham's voicing of the titular character is a bit disappointing (he plays it a bit too serious, as if forgetting that it's a childrens' film at heart), but as said earlier Price makes up for it with his fabulous turn as the villain. There's a lack of the usual catchy Disney songs (there are just three songs in the whole film, none of which are particularly memorable). On the whole, Basil The Great Mouse Detective is passable fare, but nothing special when compared to the studio's true classics."
70,The Great Mouse Detective,7,19 November 2016,Enjoyable but not among the very best of Disney...,"""The Great Mouse Detective"" was a very important Disney film for two important reasons. First, the studio was in horrible shape in the 1980s and it needed a hit badly...and the film was a considerable improvement in quality of some of the previous films (such as ""The Black Cauldron""). Second, it was the first full-length Disney cartoon to have any computer animation and was way ahead of its time.As for the film itself, this is an enjoyable film and should please everyone. However, it's also a bit slight--easier to forget and not one that is what I would consider a must-see. The animation is about that of the Disney TV shows of the time (such as ""Duck Tales"" and ""Gummi Bears"") and the characters decent but derivative. Let's face it-- it's essentially Sherlock Holmes in mouse form. Also, the sexy singing mouse scene was unnecessary and a little bit gross (as is Ratigan's sidekick). On the plus size, Vince Price is terrific and the Olivia character quite cute. Worth seeing, of course, but not quite on par with their great films of the next two decades."
71,The Great Mouse Detective,9,1 May 2016,Forget The Little Mermaid- this film started the Disney Renaissance,"The Great Mouse Detective was not only successful enough at the box office to keep Disney running after the commercial failure of The Black Cauldron, it not only sparked interest in musicals, but it is among the best animated films Disney has made. The humor is witty and hits every time, the characters are ones you will love or love to hate (Professor Ratigan is one of my favorite Disney villains), the songs are a gold star in Henry Mancini's career, the story is executed almost perfectly, and I just had a very fun time watching this with my aunt. As for issues, they border on nitpicking (some of the calm darkness doesn't hit, but I am more of a fan of thriller darkness, so it barely ruined my experience). With the excellence Disney has done with this film, I'm surprised that they didn't excrete a sequel to it (thankfully, unlike The Fox and The Hound). Go watch it imminently; this overlooked, underrated film packs everything but disappointment. If this film failed (The Little Mermaid was about 3 years away), Disney animation would become a curious piece of history, so if you think The Little Mermaid revived Disney, just see The Great Mouse Detective. I'll be content to rebuke arguments stating that the Disney Renaissance did not start here."
72,The Great Mouse Detective,,23 October 2015,Not one of my favorite Disney films.,"The animation for this particular Disney outing, in my opinion, is a bit sub-par. In fact I do recall the film getting less than stellar reviews for that very aspect.In fact the animation was so sub-par (for a Disney film at least) that I had a hard time concentrating on the story. As a comparison, Dumbo, the two Rescuers films, and even the Aristcats are visually interesting with very dynamic characters. But this film is fairly difficult to watch because of a lack of artistry on the part of the Disney studios. It quite literally looks like Don Bluth was hired with a skeleton cast to make this production come off the ground.I like the fact that our main character is named after the quintessential actor who played the famous Sleuth of 221 B-Baker street, and the Sherlock Holmes parallels, but the production values for this Disney offering are not up to what we expect from the worlds most famous, well respected, and beloved animation studio.I love Disney films; live action and animation alike. But this particular film falls a little short of my expectations. Even with the then new assistance of computer aided animation to contrive the gears of Big Ben (the Clock Tower), the film still feels dreary and somewhat static.Having made all these criticisms, I can't really say it was a bad film, just not really up to snuff for a Disney production. I think if mister Walter Disney were alive when this film was in production, he might have folded his arms and tapped his foot in impatience with the animation crew working on this film.But that's just my take. If you want Sherlock Holmes on your TV or computer screen, then please rent or buy one of the great British films staring Basil Rathbone as the world's most famous sleuth.I really hate to say this, because I do love Disney films, but I think I would avoid The Great Mouse Detective."
73,The Great Mouse Detective,5,5 May 2015,"A Little Known Disney Film, and For Good Reason. Definitely not Their Finest Work.","As I grew up during the Disney Renaissance era of the 90's when they were at the top of their game, Disney movies were a large part of my childhood and there are not very many of them that I have not seen. This was one of the few exceptions. The Great Mouse Detective is generally considered one of their lesser known films and I believe it is rightly put in that place. The 80's were the start of Disney giving their films extremely high budgets far greater than anything they had previously, yet the quality of animation in the little flick looked like some of the cheapest and undetailed work they have ever produced. One scene towards the end in the clock tower with its 3-D effect did look innovative and skill fully made but it didn't match up with the caliber of the rest of the movie. The effort was not evident and looked like it was done halfheartedly.Like many Disney films this follows a familiar story of Sherlock Holmes but instead stars his mouse counterpart the private eye Basil of Baker Street. It lacked the things that most Disney films excel at. There were no memorable songs, or a unforgettable devious villain, and most of the characters were unlikable in my opinion. Some exceptions to that were the peg legged bat Fidget and Toby the dog (who had a strange resemblance to Scooby-Doo). Even our main hero Basil was conceited, haughty, rude, obnoxious, and didn't even come off as intelligent (which is very unlike Sherlock Holmes). The story got much better towards the end as more things started happening and it made me really want to like the movie. But for me this was a dud and a Disney film that can be forgotten."
74,The Great Mouse Detective,,27 November 2011,Good movie,"wow! This movie, Great Mouse Detective was really a pleasant surprise! I went to the theater expecting another below-par Disney film (like Hunchback), but it turned out to be the most funny and enjoyable one since Aladdin (The Lion King was good, but there's just no contest between the two and the Mouse )! And a good laugh from a Disney cartoon is just what i needed. You just must see this movie! I give it a 8 out of 10 Great movie! Don't Miss it! Also recommend the Great Adventures of Mr. Todd and Sleeping Beauty This is an engaging movie with so much care and beauty fused into its core. Beauty is much more than just an influential animated classic. It is a grand and powerful fable, sugar coated with the best animation effort in a time where CGI was becoming a movie mainstay."
75,The Great Mouse Detective,10,24 April 2009,Another Favorite Disney Film Of Mine,"It had been years since I last saw this movie completely, and much like I did with The Lion King, due to slight inspirations, I decided to look for this movie on Youtube, got lucky, and saw the movie, and another trip down Memory Lane reminded me how much I love this movie.Although not as massively successful as Disney's Renaissance films, The Great Mouse Detective is still a classic, and shall remain as such in the hearts of its fans(myself included)If there is anything this film will be remembered the most for, it will be either the fact that this was the first animated film to have CGI incorporated against traditional cel animation (the legendary interior of Big Ben scene) or the fact that this was one of the last films to feature the legendary macabre actor Vincent Price in a leading role.Vincent Price delivers an insidious and devilish performance as the antagonist of our hero, Basil Of Baker Street, the notorious Professor Rattigan (loosely based on the nemesis of Sherlock Holmes, Professor Moriarty)V.P. even admitted shortly before his death that his role as Rattigan was one of his most favorite ones in his massive career, and THAT is something! The film delivers a slew of great voice performances from many actors.Barrie Ingham delivering an energetic and commendable performance as our hero Basil Of Baker Street himself, Val Bettin bringing a wonderful performance as the humble, kindhearted Dr. Dawson, Alan Young supplying his superb Scottish accent as Hiram Flaversham, the kidnapped toymaker that sets the plot for the whole film, and the young Susanne Pollatschek giving a beautiful performance as Olivia Flaversham, the toymaker's sweet, cute, innocent, and absolutely ADORABLE daughter.Memorable music, a great adventure and mystery plot, and some truly memorable scenes for the true moviegoer of all ages keeps the film going without getting boring, even for an instant.Something that you have to give Disney props for with this movie, is that this film stills gives you a dark atmosphere (19th century Victorian England) and a somewhat darker plot (A toymaker is kidnapped by Rattigan's bat henchman and is forced to construct a robot copy of the mouse Queen Of England while the real queen is to be ""erased"" so Rattigan can take over as ruler) but still gives you the tradition of lovable characters (Basil and Dawson giving the all too memorable resemblances of Sherlock Holmes and Watson's partnership, and the toymaker Flaversham's adorable little daughter, Olivia adding to the mixture as well.) and very humorous moments (the multiple instances where Rattigan flips out at being called a rat is just too much to not laugh at) For those that have always held a hidden respect for some of the later 20th century Disney films that haven't seen this film, The Great Mouse Detective is something that you cannot afford to miss. It is worth the time that you take to watch it. Believe me. The Great Mouse Detective will forever live as a Disney classic!"
76,The Great Mouse Detective,10,17 March 2007,"A great movie, a must see.","Quite simply, it is the best movie I ever saw. Actually more realistic than most movies nowadays, it has superb depth and intensity. Best of all, when Basil moves the chess piece and says checkmate, it's actually checkmate! Which most movies don't bother to actually do.At any rate, the movie, although it is only 75 minutes long, manages to play through quite a remarkable plot in a short period of time, introducing and bonding characters quite nicely. In the end, I feel that children will enjoy the movie, if for no other reason than its asthetic qualities, while parents will enjoy it for the subtlety and realism of the story (suspending disbelief that the main characters are mice, of course.)"
77,The Great Mouse Detective,7,13 October 2006,"Clever, underrated romp","London, 1897. A brilliant toymaker is kidnapped, and his bereaved little daughter goes to enlist the help of Baker Street's most brilliant mind... the great mouse detective Basil! An unfairly overlooked gem from Disney's lackluster days in the '80s, this is actually one the cleverest films they ever made. Not only will kids eat it up, but it's an absolute must for Sherlock Holmes fans. This is really a loving tribute to the beloved literary sleuth. Basil may be a mouse, but he embodies every bit of Holmes's characteristics and idiosyncrasies: his seemingly bizarre and pointless experiments, his lack of social skills, his razor sharp powers of deduction, and even his smoking habits. We are also treated to one of Disney's most over the top villains, Ratigan (voiced by none other than Vincent Price). A flamboyant criminal mastermind with deadly mood swings (don't ever call him a rat!), Ratigan is determined to overthrow the mouse queen... and maybe do away with his nemesis Basil once and for all. ""The Great Mouse Detective"" is a real delight with something for everyone: a doddering, Watson-like sidekick, a basset hound taxi, a climactic, Hitchcockian scene in Big Ben, and even cameos from Holmes and Watson themselves (provided by vintage recordings of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce). ""TGMD"" may not be as popular as ""The Lion King"" or ""The Little Mermaid"", but who cares? It's fine, intelligent entertainment that's certainly a nice break from today's brainless, by-the-numbers CGI films. It's elementary, my dears!"
78,The Great Mouse Detective,5,14 June 2006,Racy Tracy Ratigan,"OK, so how many Disney animated features can there be? At least in this case, they kept it dark and eerie and didn't turn the whole thing into an idiotically happy musical, as they did with so many other classic novels. I'd say that having Vincent Price do the villain's voice probably helped. It was also interesting that they cast Alan Young (best known as Wilbur on ""Mister Ed"") as Hiram Flaversham.So, ""The Great Mouse Detective"" is nothing particularly special, but passable. But I would recommend their computer animated movies from the past few years (like ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Finding Nemo"") more.As for the name ""Ratigan"", I remember that there was a ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" episode with a character called Racy Tracy Ratigan. As Rob reminds Laura: ""There's a lot of 'rat' in Tracy Ratigan."""
79,The Great Mouse Detective,10,24 March 2006,Truly underrated,"This is a truly an underrated film for Disney and it makes me sad that it does not get enough respect. Like Disney's version of Robin Hood it is a classic story re-enacted with animals, In this case it is Sherlock Holmes. Basically the story is set in Victorian London and the Sherlock like Basil is on an investigation to find a Doctor who has been kidnapped by the evil professor Ratigan (voiced by horror legend Vincent Price who surprisingly said it was his favourite role.) To sum it up I recommend to today's generation of kids (or people who probably did not see this when they were younger.) That they see this true Disney unappreciated classic the heroes are likable and the villain's are just plain nasty. I cannot praise this enough. Go and see it."
80,The Great Mouse Detective,10,4 February 2006,Underrated Disney Classic,"It was only a few days ago my friends and I were having a movie night and were deciding what to watch. We were looking through my old VHS's and suddenly found Disney's old classic ""The Great Mouse Detective"". I was at first stunned to see it. When I was a little kid in the early 90s I would watch this film religiously. I would get scared, thrilled, and excited. I had almost forgotten about even owning it. I was surprised to see my friends had watched it in their lifetimes too, since I always thought of it as a very underrated Disney gem. So we decided to pop it in and bring the old times back, since we haven't seen it in years.""The Great Mouse Detective"" is not like other Disney films. I think this is why I loved it so much as a kid. ""The Great Mouse Detective"" is a more DARKER Disney animation. It is extremely sophisticated in its own way and doesn't rely on special PIXAR effects to make action come to life.Let me just say the plot is something like you've never seen before.Near the beginning of ""The Great Mouse Detective,"" the camera moves through London, passing many of the familiar landmarks, before finally tilting down and moving in toward a little doorway near the ground. Inside there's a busy little mouse, a craftsman, hard at work.Before long, however, a mysterious figure appears who disrupts this image of comfortable domesticity. And then ""The Great Mouse Detective"" launches its story, which depends on the conceit that London in those days housed not only a great human detective (Sherlock Holmes) but also a mouse who was every bit as good a detective.Every character is characterized. Each one has it's own rich and colorful and dark personality. The settings are amazing, how mice are living a human life just like the humans in London. One thing the creators really payed attention to was the detailing. Almost everything is detailed. Professor Ratigan's voice is perfectly done to the character.One thing as an adult, you'll realize the interaction between Basil and the young adorable girl, Olivia Flaversham. Basil is not fond of children at all during the film, but grows in love with the girl by the end. The charisma between characters is magnificent.The whole film reminds me of the old Disney classics. But this one is just so much darker and smarter. You might not even know your watching a Disney flick. Sure kids might not understand what the hell is going on...like some of the words Basil uses is so incredibly intelligent that even watching it at the age of 17 I didn't know what he was saying. Some parts are also very creepy. Like the whole toy store part used to scare me as a kid.To a toy store spectacle, to fun little musicals here and there, to a finale on top of London's Big Ben. In my opinion, the final fight on top of London's Big Ben is one of Disney's greatest scenes ever. Now watching it recently, my only problems is that some of the scenes could have been longer. I know its supposed to be fast paced but some scenes could have been longer, especially the memorable genius scene on top of Big Ben. Also, some of the characters voicings is bad, like their lips will move but they're not talking. It's not incredibly noticeable but maybe the newer DVD'S are remastered to make it all the more better. The evil Professor Ratigan is more lovable than any Disney villain yet! Watch this underrated Disney classic soon!"
81,The Great Mouse Detective,10,4 February 2005,The Great Mouse Detective,"Maybe this is just me, but I LOVE The Great Mouse Detective! I always have. And it really annoys me that it never gets any publicity. This movie with a good story and fun characters gets NOTHING! But it's still a completely awesome movie! The songs that are in the movie are quite enjoyable, like The World's Greatest Criminal Mind and, of course, Let Me Be Good to You (Thank you, Melissa Manchester!). Also, major props to Harry Mancini for such a fun score that fits the movie so well. Barrie Ingham voiced a character whom I really love. And how can you NOT love Vincent Price?! Granted he is being a twisted, evil sewer rat, but his voice is perfect for a villain. And I just love it. The movie is great. Good job, Disney."
82,The Great Mouse Detective,10,23 January 2005,my opinion of Basil and Co,"I remember watching this movie when I was 5, and even though I had never read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works, was totally enthralled by the overall feeling which came from watching the movie. When it finally aired on TV, for (which seems to me) the first and last time, my mother taped it, and it has been in my movie collection ever since. My favorite part is when they are in the clock tower, and right after Ratigan thinks he won, when Basil rings the bell at the precise moment. *sigh* I've always loved that part. I think Basil started me off into my Sherlockian faze, which has lasted me for at least 10 years now, with no sign of stopping. So, this is my salute to Disney and this movie, and I seriously recommend this movie to anyone, of any age or persuasion. Enjoy!"
83,The Great Mouse Detective,7,10 January 2003,"Not Disney's Best, But Still Fun","While this isn't one of Disney's best movies (i.e. Beauty & the Beast, Cinderella, etc), it is still a wonderful movie. My 3 year old son and 1 year old daughter love it, and my son enjoys singing along to it (although the bat in it scares my son and my son covers his eyes whenever the bat is in a scene). It sticks to Disney's wonderful family film making quality and is a lot of fun to watch. Any Sherlock Holmes fan can appreciate this movie. The songs are origonal, and the general story line is good. The movie was made during the time when Disney wasn't having the best luck with films, and all of those same films (Oliver & Company, The Rescuers, The Aristocats, Fox and the Hound, etc), while being good films, have something different about them. I can't put my finger on it, but the films Disney made in the 70's and 80's are just different from all the others. They are good family films, and always fun to watch, but are never on a Disney fans ""classic favorites"" list. So all in all, I would give this movie a 7 out of 10. Good enough to own and watch, but not one of my top favorites from Disney."
84,The Great Mouse Detective,,29 December 2002,could have been better,"This was one of my favorites when I was a little kid. I still like it, yet not as much. The best part of it was when Basil and Ratigan got into that fight in the clock. I like the way Ratigan looked like a real dangerous rat, because he's a dangerous animal. If he had gone through the whole movie looking like he wasn't that dangerous, I wouldn't have liked it. Anyway, it wasn't that bad. I would give it a 6/10"
85,The Great Mouse Detective,10,3 November 2002,Great Movie For Familys And People Of All Ages,"Do you enjoy the adventrues of sherlock holmes? do you long for adventure and a wonderfull story that seems to be missing from movies now adays in 2002? then look no ferther then the worlds greatest mouse detective Basil This movie is packed with Acting Ledgends,Adventure,intrigue,action,and a great mystery movie all rolled into one come watch as the wonderfull art work draws you in so far you can smell the london fog Immese Yourself In One of the most romantic times in london's History  this movie is great for disney fans of all ages and a wonderfull family movie ... i reccomend it and i give it 5 out of 5 stars siskel & ebert gave it 2 thumbs up   and joel siegel,ABC-TV said ""its Magic"" so if you get a chance go out today and buy THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE  and find out what you have been missing"
86,The Great Mouse Detective,,14 September 2002,A great movie,"This is one of my absolute favorite Disney movies.  The characters are beleiveable in their mannerisms and attitude, I'm now 32 and to this day I still get goose bumps when I watch the Big Ben fight between Basil and Ratigan."
87,The Great Mouse Detective,7,26 May 2002,Not that good until...,This is not the best Disney film ever made or even one of the best.  There are many parts where the film drags on even though it is less than an hour and a half.  But the two minute scene in Big Ben makes all the difference. The first animated sequence done by computer is spectacular to see considering the relative weakness of computers to today's standards. Definitely a Disney movie to see if you have a family to watch it with.
88,The Great Mouse Detective,,10 November 2001,One of my favorite Disney movies,"I completely adore ""The Great Mouse Detective"". It's smart, classy, and very cute. It's hard to outgrow this one. Vincent Price is outstanding in his role as the cunning Ratigan, and Barrie Ingham superbly plays the witty and clever Basil of Baker Street. This film has a great cast and a wonderful score. Don't miss this one. I give it **** out of *****"
89,The Great Mouse Detective,10,1 September 2001,Wonderful Film!,This movie was wonderful! It's fun for children cause it's a mystery they can understand and fun for adults cause of all the Sherlock inside jokes. It had a fun story and is just the thing to brighten up anyone's day!
90,The Great Mouse Detective,,28 March 2001,Worth the rent,"***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***Strange little flick for a Disney movie. It's not that serious of a film until about the climax (Looney Tunes ""sneaking up"" music...) however the climax is rather well paced and well done (it's almost like it's by a different director)Worth the rent if just for the climax. All in all a good little movie"
91,The Great Mouse Detective,10,4 October 1999,A Favorite...,"One of my favorite non-Disney-like animations.Actually using wit and knowledge to get out of trouble, this gang of heroes is adorable.  The orphaned Olivia is too cute, and Vincent Price is not to be missed."
92,The Great Mouse Detective,,29 April 2002,Fun Disney Movie!,"This was a fun disney movie!  I received the very first video release of this movie on my 7th or 6th birthday.  I've loved it ever since i first watched it.  I think it partly encouraged me to play the violin(and I still play today!).The mix of things is just right.  You have the detective hero, the plump, comical sidekick who isn't funny on purpose and the lost little girl.  The villians weren't to scary and the movie had just the right number of lovable Disney songs (what else can they sing about? - ""I'm Basil of Baker street, I solve mysteries.  Oh look!  Toby has fleas!"")The comedy and action is just right.  Most kids hate kissy scenes so leaving romance out of this movie is fine.  All the characters are funny and lovable (okay except for Ratigan, Fidget, and that scary Tavern waitress).  The music is great, the animation is wonderful (especially inside Big Ben), the mystery genre is just right, and Disney didn't ruin it by turning it into a musical.  I give it a perfect 10!!!!"
93,The Great Mouse Detective,,23 February 2002,easily the funniest Disney animated film,"next to Alladin, I don't think I ever laughed this much at a Disney animated movie. Some of the scenes are downright hilarious! memorable moments include the ""let me be good to you"" scene, and Basil sitting on his Violin. watch this movie for a real, good laugh!"
94,The Great Mouse Detective,10,13 May 1999,Awesome,"Basil the Great Mouse Detective is one of the most underrated cartoons ever made.  It's wonderfully funny, has great songs and a fantastic story. Okay it's standard Disney, but it's brilliant cartoon.  A perfect 10!"
