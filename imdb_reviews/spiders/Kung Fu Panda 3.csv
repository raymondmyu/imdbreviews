0,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,14 February 2016,A Quality Family Film For All Families.,"In the Chinese Spirit Realm, Grand Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) fights against the spirit warrior and collector Kai (J. K. Simmons) and has his chi stolen, but not before he warns Kai that Po (Jack Black), the Dragon Warrior, will stop him. Kai disregards this and returns to the mortal world. Meanwhile, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) announces his retirement and passes the role of teacher to Po. He discovers that teaching kung fu is hard, as the Furious Five members Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Monkey (Jackie Chan) are injured as a result. Po is demoralized as a teacher, but is advised by Master Shifu to be himself.Po heads home to his adoptive father Mr. Ping (James Hong) at his noodle shop where a panda named Li Shan (Bryan Cranston) breaks Po's dumpling-eating record. They both soon learn that Li is Po's biological father and they bond with each other much to Ping's jealousy. After introducing Li to Shifu and his friends, the Valley of Peace is suddenly attacked by past Kung Fu Masters turned into jade statues under the control of Kai. The team then learn through research that Kai was Grand Master Oogway's old friend who fought with him long ago, but was banished to the spirit realm for 500 years when he grew thirsty for the power of chi. Kai can only be defeated by a master of true chi, which they discover was an innate ability of the panda colonies. Po, at Li's suggestion, along with Mr. Ping, travels to the secret village where the pandas hide while Shifu and the Furious Five stay behind to investigate Kai's movements and defend the Palace. Although Po is eager to learn chi, he first learns the life of a panda in the village, which he feels grateful to be a part of.After learning that all the Kung Fu masters are missing, Master Shifu sends Crane and Mantis to find them. Crane and Mantis join with other Kung Fu masters to confront Kai, but they all have their chi stolen. Kai then arrives at the Jade Palace and destroys it, then takes everybody's chi while Tigress escaped to find Po and warns him of the upcoming danger. Afraid, Li and the pandas prepare to run away. When Po demands that his father teaches him chi, he reveals that they had all forgotten chi, and he only wanted to save Po from Kai's wrath. Hurt over his father's misdirection, Po isolates himself and trains vigorously to confront Kai. Mr. Ping then comforts Li and admits he was initially worried Po would be taken away from him, but came to realize that Li being a part of Po's life simply added to his happiness, and that they should stay by Po's side as family.Tigress confronts Po and tells him that he cannot defeat Kai without continuing to discover the secret of chi, during which Po confesses that the experience has him once more doubting his potential. Li and the villagers, having decided to stay, ask Po to train them so they can fight back. Po agrees and teaches them using their everyday activities as their assets and begins their plan to save their village. Kai arrives and sends his minions to capture Po, but they are held off by the pandas and Tigress, distracting Kai. The plan works, but ultimately fails when Po tries to use the Wuxi Finger hold on Kai, who reveals that it won't work on spirits. Kai gains the upper hand in their fight, but in a last-ditch effort, Po uses the Wuxi Finger Hold on himself while grabbing onto Kai, sending them both to the spirit realm. They fight again, but Kai defeats Po and prepares to steal his chi. Using what they learned from Po and about who they are, Li, Tigress, Mr. Ping and the pandas are able to use their chi to save him. Po, with the chi flow, suddenly generates a golden dragon-shaped avatar around him and destroys Kai by overloading him with his chi, freeing all of the Kung Fu masters in the process.In an ethereal golden pond, Grand Master Oogway appears to Po, and informs him his journey has come full circle, revealing his role by selecting Po as Dragon Warrior is also because of his descent from the ancient pandas, and his embodiment of the yin-yang. He also reveals his role in alerting Li of Po's survival, and expresses his happiness to Po about how much he has grown. By choice, Po wields a mystic green staff bestowed by Oogway to return to the mortal world. Everyone returns to the Jade Palace, where Po proudly gazes upon his family, friends, and legacy in the spot where his journey began."
1,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,8 March 2016,awesomeness achieved,"Kung fu panda is a concept so ridiculous that we think to ourselves.. it is actually genius. Jack Black returns as the lovable Po, and shows us just why we missed him so much in the years we had to wait. These films always deal with acceptance and Kung Fu Panda 3 is no exception, with an added family element. I give praise for this for the simple reason that Bryan Cranston is AWESOME and really stands out in a movie that already has some brilliant stars, he was so funny and heartwarming as Po's biological father and makes a welcome addition to the cast.The story follows Po as he is asked to teach the furious 5 so Shifu can retire and master 'Chi'. After a bad session he meets his father by chance and finds out about a new supernatural threat from the spirit realm, played by the brilliant J.K Simmons. He adds his own stamp to this character and gives us a badass villain, like Cranston becoming a welcome edition. Po embarks on a journey to a secret panda village to himself master 'Chi' and take out Kai for good. So for a start the story is brilliant, it keeps everyone entertained and never lingers on for too long. The members of the furious 5 however do get less screen time, even Angelina Jolie's Tigress although she does play the biggest role of the 5. The standout for the limited screen time he has is Seth Rogen's Mantis. I don't know what it is but i love this character and wanted more of him.If you are a fan of the other films in the Kung Fu Panda franchise like i am then you won't be disappointed. The film manages to stay on par with both previous films and has all the humour and kung fu action you can expect from it. If the franchise ended here i would be happy, i would love more from the characters and the world built around them, but i really don't want the franchise to outstay it's welcome at the same time. But anyway, go see Kung Fu Panda 3. It is much better than the forgettable London has Fallen and you won't regret it!"
2,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,13 June 2016,From complexity to oversimplification: the journey is complete,"As a certain character once said, a James Bond movie is only as good as the villain. The same rule actually applies to just about any story with some kind of confrontation, with the best of such stories having villains which you even want to relate to.Kung Fu Panda trilogy is no exception. One of the reasons behind the first film's excellence was Tai Lung, a character so intense, conflicted and deeply rooted in the history of the KFP universe, that his story managed to combine the vibes of two great confrontations: Obi-Wan vs Darth Vader and Darth Vader vs Luke. So it's no wonder that my greatest wish for every next KFP movie was to have him back somehow. Those vain hopes...The villain's complexity became the foundation on which the rest of the story could develop. Including the main character. First film's Po was so great because he was a classic ""loser with a dream"" type of character: confined in his bleak reality but refusing to accept his destiny. Po's power was in finally letting himself pursue the dream he's been having on his own for so long, and in how a true dream can overcome any obstacle in its way.The problems began when Po was raised to the supreme position. It's where the pursuit of a dream was replaced with a job. Po is not a leader, he's not even a hero, he's just a guy who does what he can because his heart tells him so. But letting him keep that spirit would mean losing pace for the franchise. So each next film was basically creating a new villain out of thin air (or, in this film's case, from the other world, literally) and imposing the duty of defeating him on Po, using it as a justification for granting him another magic ability.The gods are what we create ourselves. And, at the end of the day, KFP3 finished creating a cult of the Dragon Warrior by transforming Po from a goofus with a heart and spirit into some kind of omnipotent golden Buddha, smiling and just-be-yourself-preaching. The complexity is gone, the humanity, with all its inherent flaws, is gone. The only thing that's left is the divine perfection and invulnerability. Maybe the kids will love such glossy happy ending, just like they love playing video games in god mode: easy win, plain and simple. But for someone more mature, that kind of easy is just boring."
3,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,31 January 2016,Another great movie,"I went with my 14-year old son to watch Kung Fu Panda 3. We both loved it. It's definitely a feel-good movie. We've watched every Kung Fu Panda movie, and we are definitely fans. The cast is incredible! Jack Black is awesome as Po, as usual. We particularly enjoyed the music score (which nicely emphasized the emotional parts) and the artwork. I appreciated that there were morals woven into this movie, especially with regard to finding your true self, appreciation of what it means to be a family and the importance of family, and Po's learning about chi, the life force in all living things. This all added depth to Po's character. There were, of course, many funny moments in the movie that made us both laugh. At the end of the movie (and we always stay to the very end, reading all the credits), the artwork was particularly beautiful, where they took images from the movie and made it look like an ancient, Chinese watercolor. We left feeling very good about having spent time together at this movie!"
4,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,31 January 2016,Whoooaaaahhhh!!!!,"So being a huge fan of Kung Fu Panda, I may be a little biased, but Kung Fu Panda 3 delivers!!! I was so excited to the see the movie as I think this story line has some aspects of awesomeness!!! Jack Black leads and all star cast of actors that bring not only great animation, but also solid entertainment from start to finish. I went with my girl, who had to fight back the tears through parts of the movie, especially the end. Yes it was moving and had a great message. Family and knowledge are just some of the major points Kung Fu Panda focuses on. But enough of the parent stuff, Kids will love it, so many little voices throughout the theater busted out in their joyous cute laughs, along with their parents. It has so much fun for children they will not be disappointed. But for adults, lets say us men will love the action and some cool above normal animation which happen all over the movie to keep some of us action junkies enthralled. And women will love the messages of love, family and self-worth with some beautiful scenes of colors and imagination. Not to say I didn't enjoy all aspects of the movie. As far as a trilogy goes, Kung Fu Panda, at least for me and my girl was as good if not better than its predecessors. Which to me was not easy to beat. Jack Black brings to life a lovable, clumsy, hungry, Kung Fu Panda that anyone can relate to or enjoy. Kung Fu Panda 3 is a true treat on many levels and great for any family, date or lover of animation.enjoy it!!! Skadooooshhh!!!"
5,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,26 January 2016,Just as awesome as the first two. Skadoosh!,"There's a reason why the ""Kung Fu Panda"" franchise is one of the most successful of all-time, and I'd like to believe that that reason is because the writers and the creative talents behind it know how to solidly move the story forward, even with the same characters, they know how to make them evolve without losing the charm and the heart that made the first and the second film effective.In KUNG FU PANDA 3, Master Shifu appoints Po as the new teacher, a responsibility that of course Po is not able to handle, because he feels more comfortable just being the dragon warrior that saves the village whenever they need help. But that's the thing, once you've felt comfortable and you do only what you can, then you close any room for growth. But being a teacher is not Po's only new challenge. We know that it was just a matter of time until Po reconnects with his family, it was teased at the second film's end. Po's long-lost panda father reappears, just as the supernatural villain Kai, from the spirit realm, returns to the mortal world and vows vengeance. Each film has a certain kung fu style or a goal that Po must achieve, and in this one he has to master the Chi while at the same time learning to know what it means to be a panda.I had concerns at first because ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is released this month, and you know that January is a dumping ground for terrible movies. But now I see that this may actually have been a smart move on the studio's part because this is quite possibly the only great film this month, people will turn to ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" because everything else will disappoint them.Just like the first and the second film, KUNG FU PANDA 3's animation is sharp and beautiful. The action sequences are fun and entertaining, and there's a little bit of a fish-out-water situation as well because our hero Po is pretty much new to this whole Panda village and they way they do things over there. But what rings true throughout all three films is that it's ultimately about Po's journey to become one with who he is. He accepted his destiny despite people's doubts, he let go of the past and found inner peace, and now he's put to the test once more, his confidence will be tried once more, and so seeing him be the underdog again is why root for Po. And on top of that, KUNG FU PANDA 3 never runs out of ammo to get you to feel emotional and they do it without trying too hard because it's done in a way that serves the story and the characters, the emotional scenes make sense, I often say that ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies faithfully follow Pixar's manual  the undeniable importance of a well-written story; one that goes straight for the heart and aims to inspire. KUNG FU PANDA 3 is simply awesome! And it's so cool if you think about it, this is an animated family film franchise that gets more and more solid with each installment, and that's rare."
6,Kung Fu Panda 3,2,10 April 2016,Greatly disappointed,"I am a great fan of this franchise and I am very disappointed with this part. This movie had glimpses but it was not the complete movie like the last two. The beginning lasted till the end, and the end, ended abruptly where Po and rest of the panda's master the forgotten technique and defeat the most powerful Kai in a breath. Positives: 1. Po meets his dad (Trailer gave it away anyways) 2. Cant find any otherNegatives: 1. No solid story line and no solid plan for Po on how to learn new stuff. 2. Well no plan needed as the villain Kai did not get a chance to display his evilnessHave to watch the first two parts in sequence to get my chi back.I hope the makers crack their heads and give us a more complete movie where Po advances to the next level and teaches the world few new tricks."
7,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,9 March 2016,Sublime animated picture.,"The Good Stuff (in order of awesomeness) 1. Superb animation and various art styles used. Hits are emphasized well with excellent sound design and voice acting. Good action. 2. Jokes are (mostly) good, made me laugh out loud multiple times. 3. The plot and pacing is pretty good and character development is adequate.The Bad Stuff (in order of amplitude) 1. Antagonist is not really memorable with vanilla personality and motivation. 2. Film is obviously meant for a young-ish audience and contains some irritating slapstick and bad jokes. 3. 99% of Panda characters are completely forgettable.Should you watch it: Probably, yes. I can't stress enough how good some of the visuals are."
8,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,1 April 2016,Good animation! Good 3D! Story wise same old! same old!,"At start it felt like that I have entered that awesomely animated familiar environment of kungfun with our favourite panda. Sadly the same feeling remains the whole time. Don't get me wrong, fights are still fun but story wise you get the feel they are just trying to make things up now. Also it doesn't help to keep similar story structure every time. It just bores you much of the time. Not caring about the characters as you already know what their fate is going to be, you have ample amount of time to appreciate the animation. I really liked the 2-D animation that is shown for flashback. Moreover there's so much pseudo philosophical drag & knowledge sharing going on that it makes you feel ""ya ya! just give me some more kungfun already!""Now children would definitely love this film. But for any adult who have already watched the awesome first part & then the follow-up later, it could still be fun provided you are in really good mood (& remain so while ignoring (virtually) repeated script and zero character developments) and ready to mentally kungfu-dance through whole film on the song ""Everybody's kungfu fightin'..."" :D"
9,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,6 March 2016,Panda Team Has done it again !!,The 3rd part is as hilarious and awesome as the first two movies. Keeping up the story-line and interest in a 3rd movie is really difficult but the kudos to the whole team. Though storyline is on the same lines of good vs evil but again told in a very outstanding way. The best part of the movie is the humor and you are guaranteed to laugh every now and then. The animation is of high quality and of course very beautiful cinematography. Must watch for all 'Po' fans. His own way of saving the world and being the dragon warrior will stun yet again in a very grand and spectacular way.
10,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,17 March 2016,Bearable,"Kung Fu Panda 3 meets the minimum requirements in what fans of the first two films would expect: jokes about weight, Po's still struggling with handling Kung Fu (even though he became the ""dragon warrior"" at the end of the first film) and questions of how to determine what true family is. Sadly, the film itself lazily meets these expectations without providing much else for its fan base.We start with an uninteresting villain played by J.K. Simmons. He is an associate of Master Oogway, and that is how he is known (this joke gets really old really fast within the film itself). He manages to escape the spirit realm (this universe's equivalent of the afterlife) and is determined to take over the spirits of kung fu masters because.... well who cares? The film simply establishes he is a bad guy who wants revenge and to have control over the real world - you know, your typical one-dimensional children's movie villain.Po's father, played by Bryan Cranston, finds him at the start of the film, which is really convenient because pandas are supposed to know about something called ""chi"" which is what the villain is after. Pandas were known to heal Oogway with this power in the past, and it is of course the only way to stop Simmons' character. This subplot eventually clears up what we did not know about the pandas in this universe, and of course the film goes to great lengths to make comedy out of how lazy pandas turn out to be.The jokes used in this film are just rehashed jokes from the first two films, not providing great comedy as its predecessors since it proves to be unoriginal. Kung Fu Panda 3 is still enjoyable, but its strength lies on the theme of questionable identity posed by the two competing fathers of the film: Mr. Ping and Li. This is only touched on a few times throughout the film, but when it is touched on it brings up interesting questions about whether Po would need nature or nurture: that is, does he need his biological father or the one who raised him. These moments are the only ones of great intrigue within the film.There is also a return to a cop-out fighting technique from the first film that makes the conflict of the story less difficult for Po to get through. While the film has the same spirit of its predecessors, Kung Fu Panda 3 is not a very fun film, but it is not terrible.2.5/4.0"
11,Kung Fu Panda 3,,9 April 2016,Fails To Replicate The Formula That Made Its Predecessors Instant Classics Right Away,"The third chapter in DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda series may have the effervescent wit, lighthearted flavour & exciting kung fu action of the earlier chapters but it lacks a compelling story, weighty character evolution & the awareness of where to draw the line for this latest entry fails to find the near-perfect balance between its genre elements, something its predecessors excelled at with relative ease.The story of Kung Fu Panda 3 continues the awesome journey of the Dragon Warrior as we find Po reuniting with his biological father in addition to being bestowed with the role of teacher, following Master Shifu's retirement. But when an ancient spirit warrior with the ability to steal other warriors' chi returns to the mortal world & hunts the Dragon Warrior, Po travels with his father to their secret panda village to master ways of defeating the enemy.Co-directed by Jennifer Yuh & Alessandro Carloni, the issue I have with this feature is that its story lacks a coherent structure, it is difficult to connect with any of the characters for their arcs needed a lot more refinement, and there are plenty of moments that add nothing to the story. The previous chapters were able to find outrageous moments of hilarity in a well-timed & clever fashion but here its attempt at humour feels a bit too forced, needlessly silly & uneven for the most part.Comedy when done right can amuse both the kids & grown-ups but the filmmakers have chosen to target the younger audience more this time. There are still plenty of laugh-out-loud moments that are done well but for the most part, it neither enriches the overall experience nor moves the story forward. The computer animation is still worthy of praise and retains the rich, colourful textures of past two instalments. Editing is a letdown for the narrative lacks a smooth, uniform flow. And Hans Zimmer's score isn't striking either.On an overall scale, Kung Fu Panda 3 is an overkill for its emphasis on desperately finding ways to make its audience laugh ultimately backfires and while it works as a quite relaxing, enjoyable & amusing flick, it fails to duplicate the high scores that the previous chapters garnered in all departments of filmmaking. Certainly not worth the five year wait, exhibiting signs of weariness & marred by lazy writing, Kung Fu Panda 3 fails to properly implement the formula that turned the first two films of the franchise into instant classics right away."
12,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,8 March 2016,"Not bad, but not a grand installment or anything like that","Meh...It's alright but it's still the weakest in the trilogy in my opinion. The first one dealt with the build up of Po learning kung- fu and learning to become the Dragon Warrior. It's usually always intriguing to watch the underdog overcome obstacles. The second one dealt with Po putting his kung-fu skills to the test and is the most action packed one in the franchise so far. And revolved around getting over the past hurts and scars while trying to become a better person in the here and now. This one deals with Po finding his roots and origin. Like I said, it's a alright watch but it's actually quite forgettable. The action isn't all that memorable and the story just needed more meat to it. This would have been fine as a TV movie or 3 or 4 episodes as a Saturday morning show. It's a alright movie, that is actually quite watchable but I am not excited to see it again. The whole family dynamic aspect of this movie just wasn't all that fun to sit through. I give it props for trying something different and trying to bring in something more than just action. But I just couldn't gravitate towards it all that much.6.8/10"
13,Kung Fu Panda 3,4,14 June 2016,Part 3,It is part 3 of an animated film that should be enough to tell you the level of quality you shall see. It has the cash in quality of any animated part 3 or direct-to-DVD product out there. There is no story or pacing. The voice cast of the originals show up for two or three lines and then vanish simply to obey their contracts. It is one of the most overly used story lines in the genre and one just simply has to roll with the punches hoping your children laugh. It is a cash in and you are watching it for your children or something in that regard. Any other reason other than that leaves to me ask then why are you watching this?
14,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,7 February 2016,Funny and Gorgeously Animated,"Kung Fu Panda is yet another solid entry in the Kung Fu Panda film series. It should be noted that while it's subjective, my opinion is that Kung Fu Panda 3 is ever so slightly the weakest of the franchise, but that's not a knock on the film. Kung Fu Panda 3 is often funny, beautifully animated, and features great characters. This is another great animated film for the entire family, that will surely delight people of all ages.The tone of Kung Fu Panda 3 is a somewhat silly one, much like the other Kung Fu Panda films, however it does a good job of balancing mature themes with silly humor. The film also does a good job of balancing both subtle and witty humor with more bombastic and silly humor. The humor is bolstered by the terrific voice acting of the entire cast, which is as per usual great. Many times throughout this film I found myself laughing hysterically.Another impressive element of the film is the amazing animation in this film. It may seem like every animated film features beautiful animation, but the animation in this film is truly amazing. Another impressive element of the animation is the action, which in an animated film may not seem like something to watch for, but the action sequences in Kung Fu Panda 3 are amazing. Many times watching this film the animation is so good it looks real, which is in it's own right an amazing accomplishment.The film's pacing is great, but what's even better is the character development. With a story that isn't the strongest, the characters keep the film entertaining. Besides the villain, a character who feels like a forced conflict thrown in just to give the film drama, all of the characters in this film have some kind of development. Many of the characters are relatable, which helps the audience care about them. With characters that the audience can relate to and root for, the consequences of the film feel even heavier. In Conclusion Kung Fu Panda 3 is a great fun film for the entire film with a little bit of something for everyone. The film is gorgeously animated, features well developed characters, great action sequences, good voice acting, and a terrific sense of humor. Despite the weak villain, occasionally silly tone, and some clichés the film is still very enjoyable. If you have some young kids take them to this film you'll all enjoy it."
15,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,7 February 2016,Every Bit as Good as the Others,"I enjoyed the first two Kung Fu Panda movies a lot more than I thought I would and I had a feeling that this one was going to be every bit as good as the others. I'm happy to say that I wasn't wrong. It's weird how well these films are able to combine humor and action while appealing to both children and adults. Plenty of other children's movies have been able to pull off the humor but the action has remained really well done throughout the entire series. Anyway, let's get to the plot.This film follows fairly soon after the events of the second movie with Po (Jack Black) continuing his duties as the Dragon Warrior. Things soon start to change for Po when Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) gives him the responsibility of teaching the Five while he pursues the ancient art of 'chi'. In addition to this, Po's biological father, Li (Bryan Cranston), finally finds him and wants to start a new relationship with him. As if things weren't already complicated enough, Kai (J.K. Simmons), an evil Yak from the spirit realm, uses the chi from dead kung fu masters to make his way back to the mortal realm and starts causing havoc. Now Po has to travel to the hidden Panda village to learn the ancient art of chi and use it to once again vanquish Kai from the mortal realm.Most of the cast returns for this movie and the few newcomers fit right in without any problems. Jack Black has really done a great job with the character of Po and it's hard for me to imagine anyone else stepping into those shoes. The humor and the drama seem to come surprisingly easy with Black and he's obviously comfortable playing this character. All of the returning actors and actresses also do an excellent job with their characters but the newcomers are the ones who really shine here. Bryan Cranston is basically amazing at everything he does and his Li is no exception. I know Cranston can do drama like it's no one's business but he also has great comedic timing. I especially liked his interactions with James Hong. We also have another fantastic villain with J.K. Simmons added to the mix. This guy has done quite a bit of voice acting in the past and his experience really shows here. I didn't even know it was Simmons until the credits started rolling which just goes to show how well this guy is able to change his voice and get into character.The animation is once again beautifully done and the Panda village looks fantastic. At first I was disappointed that we didn't see more new areas but the scenes in the spirit realm definitely make up for it. The story delves deeper into Po's past similar to the last film but we get to see him interact with other pandas and even an old face from the first movie. There really isn't anything that I didn't like about this film. I suppose the story was a little easy to predict but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This is a kid's movie after all.I'm not much for nitpicking and it's even harder when the film is this good to begin with. It's a great movie and I have to recommend it to anyone interested in these types of movies, especially if you have children that you want to take to the theater. This is an easy choice if that's the case."
16,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,6 February 2016,Best of the series so far!,"I walked in Kung Fu Panda 3 with high expectations and they were met, and more! The other two KFP films are gold, and DreamWorks shows that they can top themselves every time with their characters and story lines. The fight scenes are amazing, the animation is top-notch, the characters are lovable and the voice cast is lively-what more can you want? This comedy had me and the audience laughing throughout the entire experience, and I don't have one complaint about this gem of a film! The 3-D effects are also worth the extra money- not the best I've ever seen from an animation, but pretty good. The score by Hans Zimmer is also beautiful, it's completely fitting for every scene. Get your kids, grab some 3-D glasses, get some popcorn and sodas and prepare for an awesome thrill ride."
17,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,5 February 2016,The most awesomeness of the awesome line of awesomeness filled awesome movies,"I loved the previous two movies. So when I went in to watch this, I had high expectations. By the end of the movie, I was in tears. I think I had not expected so much depth and....goodness from an animated feature film. The basic premise is what you get from the trailer. Kai comes to destroy the jade palace and Po has to find out how to defeat him with the help of his new-found dad! However, what you don't expect is a perfect tale of eastern philosophy of life and the human spirit deliciously hidden inside a fun family movie.** spoilers ** The best part of the movie is... Oogway! He is back in Yin and Yang (see the movie to understand what I mean, can't be described in words). And Po becomes the true dragon warrior. I was having goosebumps from that one scene. Also listen to Oogway's every word. The depth of this ""person"" may surprise even the most cynical among us. I so wish that he stays in future movies!"
18,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,7 February 2016,I Love Kung Fu Panda,"When Po's long-lost panda father suddenly reappears, the reunited duo travels to a secret panda paradise to meet scores of hilarious new panda characters. But when the supernatural villain Kai begins to sweep across China defeating all the kung fu masters, Po must do the impossible-learn to train a village full of his fun-loving, clumsy brethren to become the ultimate band of Kung Fu Pandas. Kung Fu Panda 3 is a 2016 3D American-Chinese computer-animated action comedy martial arts film, produced by DreamWorks Animation and Oriental DreamWorks, and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It was directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni. The film was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, produced by Melissa Cobb, and executive produced by Guillermo del Toro. It is a sequel to the 2011 film Kung Fu Panda 2 and the third installment in the Kung Fu Panda franchise. I love KUNG FU PANDA"
19,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,11 March 2016,Dragon Warrior Rising,"This is my review of Kung-fu Panda 3 (Spoiler free)Distributor(s): Fox/DreamworksDirector(s): Alessandro Carloni & Jennifer YuhCast: Jack Black, Academy Award Nominee Bryan Cranston*, Angelina Jolie, 2 time Academy award winner Dustin Hoffman**, Academy Award winner J.K. Simmons***, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen.Plot: Continuing his ""legendary adventures of awesomeness"", Po must face two hugely epic, but different threats: one supernatural and one a little closer to home.The Dragon Warrior returns in the silliest and the darkest of the trilogy this time to face spirit warrior Kai (Simmons), who has returned to the mortal world to capture the Chi of all the warriors in China. The first movie back in 2008 was dark and thrilling and really quite fun, the second (2011) promised to be darker but didn't quite deliver. With the same story as it's predecessors between good and evil this one is outrageously funny and sometimes a little bit silly the third and final film is fun for all the family, here are some points of why I think this film is a must see:Hilarious Dialogue: The film has hilarious moments from start to finish especially between Po and Li-Shan (Cranston) some of the moments just made me burst out laughing. Visually Stunning: Every single one of these films has had a gorgeous but this one probably has the best with some the amazing colours that just burst out the screen, the part that really stands out is the spirit world that just has an outstanding feel that just gives you a warm feeling.This film just feels a warm hug that just comes out of nowhere Jack Black has really outdone himself this time as the lovable panda. The one main fault and it's tiny is that some of the jokes go on for longer than they should but you should get over that.The furious five have returned and this time better than ever. This film is a must see for all the family especially with it's recent success in China, this film is worth every penny. Remember the secret panda village is waiting for you. A truly outrageous animation and a must see 9/10 (4.5 out of 5).Verdict: Rather than the cynical ""one last grab"" of the series, Kung Fu Panda might actually be the best. Also this might be worth going to watch in 3D.*Best supporting actor (Trumbo, 2015), **Best supporting actor (Kramer Vs.

20,Kung Fu Panda 3,5,7 August 2016,A disappointment,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is good, but it could have been great. That's a shame. The core of the movie is solid, with enough of both heart-warming and heart-stopping moments, but the majority of the movie is really unfunny filler. As per usual, the majority of the cast have maybe two lines in the entire movie, far too much time is devoted to slapstick shenanigans and most of the plot is info-duped at the end.The story is an almost beat-for-beat recreation of Kung Fu Panda 2. A new villain has shown up (in this case Kai, the Spirit Warrior who can steal people's chi) and Po must learn a new spell in order to defeat him. The Five are completely useless, Shifu is completely useless, Po is completely useless right up until the end when victory is handed to him by Deus Ex Machina. There's enough plot there for a 20-minute TV episode, but it's stretched into a barely 90-minute movie by judicious padding.If you don't mind a movie wasting your time and its own potential with what feels like an eternity playing with the pandas, you'll find enough to be engaged. There are themes of self-identification, familial bonds, friendship and even coming of age... Again. The voice actors are talented and able to give gravitas to frankly amateurish writing, the visuals are beautiful enough to bring a tear to the eye and there's a surprising amount of action to be found. It's just a shame that all of that couldn't be put in an entire movie.The original Kung Fu Panda was great because it played to the beats of an old bootleg Hong Kong Kung Fu movie of the sort Jackie Chan might have starred in back in the 80s. Its final lesson, at the end of the day, was a simplistic but heartfelt ""believe in yourself"" as Po the Dragon Warrior had only to look at himself and his own strength to defeat adversity. Kung Fu Panda 2 - and now Kung Fu Panda 3 - make the mistake of hinging everything on magical powers which are inevitably given to Po so he can win and so that character development can be dropped onto him. In the meantime, Tigress and the others only serve to get beaten up so the villain looks more menacing.Bizarrely enough, Kung Fu Panda 3 could use less ""Panda"" and more ""Kung Fu."""
21,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,5 February 2016,Who are you?,"Well this is the third Panda movie where this central question leads to the climax. While this may seem rather repetitious, it bears repeating. Can the viewers actually take this message to heart and apply it to their own lives, we'll see wont we.Focusing on ""who we are"" is profoundly important and like an onion each of us has multiple layers so does Po the Panda. While it does include kicking a$$ and stopping bad guys, there are other dimensions which go beyond that, like allowing others to be who they are too.Jack Black and crew do the same great job as the other two movies. Having this be an animated movie allows it to get beyond the natural physical aspects of the story line into the spirit realms."
22,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,1 February 2016,Kung Fu Panda 3 takes it's next step in another beautiful and funny story about the martial arts,"Time to go back into the world of DreamWorks animation. I had read more information about the company's corporate shakeup that not only involved several people replace and relocated, but it also involved the closing of the Northern California studios and the reduction of the output of feature films. It seemed like a formidable movie fiscally, until the release of last year's Home, which I mentioned that I didn't care for. I guess I wasn't the only one as the critical reviews were tepid, and the box office numbers were low (not a failure, but not even close to a hit). Has DreamWorks truly learned?If the new original features aren't doing well, then the next strategy would be to take advantage of some of their past hits. Shrek, Madagascar, and How to Train Your Dragon seem to be the franchises that they like push and make more sequels and television programs. I like those movies (except Madagascar), though my favorite is the Kung Fu Panda films. This is the ultimate ""don't judge by its cover"" story as it's dumb title is really a silly martial arts story that teaches a lot about Chinese philosophy. Po's training is taken the next step in Kung Fu Panda 3.Master Shifu (played by Dustin Hoffman) has announced that's he's stepping down as the teacher of the Furious Five: Master Tigress (played by Angelina Jolie), Master Crane (played by David Cross), Master Mantis (played by Seth Rogan), Master Viper (played by Lucy Liu) and Master Monkey (played by Jackie Chan). Shifu says that the only one who can teach them is the dragon warrior, Po (played by Jack Black). Po is still his silly self and doesn't feel like he can be a good teacher. It's evident on the his first day when the masters are unimpressed.While visiting his adoptive father Mr. Ping, a large panda named Li Shan (played by Bryan Cranston) comes looking for his long lost son. Po is excited to finally meet his father let alone another panda, who were thought to have been gone. Shifu knows that the Panda's were masters of controlling chi, so he tells Po to go with his real father to discover chi. Within the hidden Panda village, Po learns more about being one of his own and learning more about his family. Meanwhile, Kai (played by J.K. Simmons), a powerful spirit that can take away one's chi has entered the mortal world in order to gain chi from all the Masters. Tigress shows up at Po's village to reveal that all the masters have been taken by Kai and it's up to Po to fight him and teach Kung- Fu to all the pandas.I really appreciate DreamWorks for not only taking Chinese martial arts and philosophy seriously, but for taking the story of a Kung-Fu fighting panda just as seriously. Not only is Po really learning more about what his skills can do, but really seems to be growing as a personor a bear.Kung Fu Panda 3 still boasts some of the most beautiful computer animation I've seen from DreamWorks. It is so atmospheric, that this is one of the few movie worlds I'd love to live in. The characters from the previous movies are all back and play up their parts just fine. The newcomers Bryan Cranston and J.K. Simmons both bring in their own spark, fitting in just fine. Without giving anything away, I only have two gripes. While J.K. Simmons does well as Kai, he's not as intimidating as Gary Oldman from Kung Fu Panda 2. Also, when Po's father Li Shan make a big discovery about himself, it's a little rushed.I'll give this eight Chinese scrolls out of ten. This is a part of a series that is just so funny and beautiful, that I find it hard to find much to nitpick. Kung Fu Panda 3 is a great piece of family entertainment that should get both the parents and children engaged. I hope these characters continue Kung Fu fighting for a while!"
23,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,2 April 2016,Not upto the mark set by it's predecessors,"The movie starts out good. It has a nice build up at first but this build up never leads to a climax. In each movie, Po has mastered or at least realized and actualized an aspect of kung fu. The aspect chosen for this movie had no build up. Po throughout the movie learns an integral skill of kung fu and the whole process is beautifully depicted but in the end the climax is rather sudden and a little too-good-to-be-true. The movie has a great villain which just keeps on improving with each movie. The character of the villain is explored in depth but I felt similar justice was not done to the Furious Five, Shifu or Po. The movie seemed a little rushed in the end which could have been converted into a whole other movie."
24,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,29 January 2016,"Funny, but probably the cheesiest of the trilogy.","There's some good news about Kung Fu Panda 3, and there's some bad news. The good news is that it's genuinely funny at times and the animation is stunning(perhaps as good as we've seen from Dreamworks) and the movie works well enough to be enjoyable. The bad news is, it could have been much more. When Po meets his biological dad for the first time, it should have been an emotional, touching moment; instead it was played for laughs. And instead of making the villain Kai a threat to respect, they just made him goofy. Plus, the ""Furious Five"" get barely any screen time and the new characters are hardly worth mentioning. Also, the main idea of this movie being about ""who am I"", is practically a rehash of the first two movies. Yet with all its faults, the movie is still enjoyable if you take it for what it is, a funny, but cheesy third movie in the Kung Fu Panda trilogy."
25,Kung Fu Panda 3,1,31 January 2016,Stale Popcorn,"Aside from decent graphics, this ""movie"" is nothing more than a recycled, old, stale storyline. It is the same story as ""Finding Nemo"" and every other ""oh my son"" flick made in the last fifty years. Father loses boy, boy finds father. Journey in between with perils, hazards, and a strong woman to play off of. In this one though, there are ridiculous fight scenes reminiscent of 1970's martial arts films that ripped off Bruce Lee (this is how, of course we get Kung Fu). The tigress was, I admit, kind of cool. Wonderful eyes. The plot centers around ""Chi,"" which literally translates from Chinese to English as ""breath"", ""air"", or ""gas."" With Kung Fu Panda 3, only the ""gas"" translated. I, personally, have never understood the ""oh, my son"" storyline and I, for one, am tired of seeing it. DreamWorks needs to take Disney's lead...understand when a story has been told and doesn't need to be told again. It was kind of funny though...every time I heard the line ""I have the power,"" I was hoping that He-Man or She-Ra would show up and save the movie. Wait until this comes one out on network TV, to let the kids see it. It is not worth even discounted admission."
26,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,16 February 2016,"Humorous, profound, culturally significant, and overall brilliant","""My son is alive?"" After half a decade, the Kung Fu Panda trilogy is finally complete and the questions plaguing our minds from the first two films are answered. Po has mastered kung fu and even the powerful wuxi finger hold, but now he must master the art of teaching and chi if he is going to defeat his most deadly opponent yet. Po has proved himself to be a dedicated and skilled warrior but the reunion with his biological father could either enhance or retard his training and personal growth. Po is advised by Master Shifu to ""discover who he is"" but with his biological father and his adopted father both tugging at him like a wishbone, this proves to be a most difficult task. The talented Jack Black reprises his role as Po for the final time. As do all of the members of the Furious Five, Randall Duk Kim (as Master Oogway), Dustin Hoffman (as Master Shifu), and James Hong (as Mr. Ping/Po's adopted father). Joining the cast is Bryan Cranston (as Li/Po's biological father) and several other new panda characters. Cranston and Hong give riveting performances as two fathers that don't want to lose their son and are easily the shining stars of the film. Like its predecessors, this film is visually stunning. The animated sequences inspired by traditional Chinese artwork are sensory heaven and even the 3d animation is nothing short of spectacular. The soundtrack enhances the experience without overshadowing the action- which, by the way, is better than ever. In the epic fight scene, Po puts Rocky Balboa to shame. There hasn't been a film so heartfelt and inspirational since the Shawshank Redemption. It deals with loyalty, sacrifice, blended families, and self identity in a sincere and complex way. I can easily see Kung Fu Panda 3 becoming a classic of not only children's films, not only animated films, but cinema in general."
27,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,7 February 2016,"weakest of the trilogy, but still a decent one.","SPOILERS Kung Fu Panda 3 is an emotional family movie with interesting storyline, good humor and fantastic animation which is one of the best that Dreamworks has ever made. Every detail is carefully elaborated and the characters are extremely well designed. The 3-D effects are also good. The score by Hans Zimmer is also fitting for every scene.The secret village of pandas is memorable,cute and funny. The fighting scenes are amazing and tensed although some of them ended too quickly ( for example: the spirit world is gorgeous, but the fight between Po and Kai is very short and one sided.)The idea of eastern philosophy is inspirational but still gets repetitive and similar to previous ones, dealing with same obstacles and dilemmas of finding yourself and going beyond the limits. The scene where Po meets his dad should have been more dramatic and emotional.The character of Kai could have been more profound, I could not catch why he changed so drastically, like if any other events intrigued his treachery and obsession towards power?The relationship between Oogway and Kai needed more profound exploration and depth. Giving Kai more reason, more depth could have made him much more memorable and respectable villain.Overall, the movie is really worth watching. It offers a good pleasure,great action and outstanding animation although it could've been much better with more intricate story along with a better script and deeper characters. Eventually, my favorite the massage of the Kung Fu Panda is inspirational and worth thinking about : ""If you only do what you can do, you'll never be more than you are"" -Shifu."
28,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,29 January 2016,Feel the Thunder..again!,"The third installment of the epic animated Kung fu Franchise is here.In this adventure, Po becomes Master of the school, just as he reunites with his long lost father and discovers a secret village filled with Panda's where he must learn his final lesson in order to defeat a new evil. The animation in this movie is so beautifully done just like the first two movies. Po never stops being an amazing character. I hear the voice of Jack Black in Po, but together with the animators and character designers, they created something really special.And it's just so much fun, filled with epic battles and brilliant sight gags that keep your eyes glued to the screen, and keeps a smile on your face.Everybody is Kung fu fighting! fabulous"
29,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,6 February 2016,One of the Best Animated Movies Ever Made. In The Top 15.,"Whenever I go into a Dreamworks movie, I have very low expectations. I expected Kung Fu Panda 3 just to be another style and no substance movie. From the trailers, it looks average at best. But when you actually see the movie for yourself, you will be blown away. I can't say if Dreamworks is actually getting better for myself, but their last few films like How to Train Your Dragon 2 and Home have been better than what they have released in past years. I really think this is one of The Top 15 Best Animated Movies Ever Made. 15 or 14 would take the spot. Here is why.The story is an old one, cliché also. But it's done in a way that I don't think has been done before. It tries so many new things with this movie giving it a modern twist on a movie where a person with an identity crisis finds himself. That is the main reason why I love Kung Fu Panda 3 so much.The story? Well, After a spirit warrior named Kai is back in the mortal realm, Po finds his real father named Li Shan where he is overjoyed to see him. In order to defeat Kai, Po must go with his father to the secret panda village up in the mountains where his adoptive father Mr. Ping tags along with them. Can Po be in time to stop himself and the other pandas from being abolished? The threat this time seems bigger than ever.Yes. The threat in this movie is actually quite threatening. J.K Simmons voices Kai, who takes the Chi of the living Kung Fu masters including Master Shifu and most of the Furious Five which is an actually surprising development. You don't often see a film where most of the main heroes are defeated that easily which is why this is part of this new take on a classic story thing. The cast is great and Jack Black does his best Po Performance yet. Everyone although some have little screen time are a huge part of the story also even if they are meant to be running gags. That is smart. Really smart.The animation. My god. This is some of the best animation Dreamworks has ever done. I thought How To Train Your Dragon 2 would top it forever but this is just purely amazing! Every detail is beautiful and the characters are extremely well designed. This is already one of the best animated films of the year and there are many more that I am excited about.Directors Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh Nelson have improved greatly on their last series effort, making everything feel more human. The explanation of Chi and the back-story of Kai is also excellent. This was a movie where it was unpredictable, and that is great for Dreamworks doing stuff like this!If you liked the first two movies, Kung Fu Panda 3 is the one movie you must take your kids to see. I loved it, it is definitely a great movie and I can't wait to get it on Blu Ray. Bravo Dreamworks! 90/100 A-"
30,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,5 February 2016,This movie rocks.,"(SPOILER ALERT)Climax of the movie was really freaking awesome. The bad ass villain Kai returns.Po has a new job,to be the teacher of kung-fu replacing Shifu.Shifu suddenly quits and puts Po in charge.In the meantime Po finds his real father who was sent by Oogway for a greater cause.The villain Kai is going after everything Oogway created and the pandas hiding in the village.In the end Po unlocks his full power and chi with help of All the pandas in the village,the movie gives a strong message that strength of family is important.The movie has introduced a lot of panda characters who are after all cuter than Po himself.The movie had a mix of fun and action as usual. In the end Po meets Oogway and gives him the elder wand and puts him in charge.Movie ends with Po teaching shifu and everyone to master chi."
31,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,11 February 2016,About as good as I could expect from a third installment.,"Don't set you expectations too high for a third installment, in any series or franchise. It was a given this movie would borrow heavily from the first two, wouldn't be as deep in character development (most of the main characters are mostly already defined), and the film would probably follow the same overall theme of the first two. I went in expecting this much, and is pretty much the only reason I didn't rate the movie higher. I really enjoyed it.The film fills in some plot elements from the first two movies that I found interesting, adds a few new characters we were already expecting, and adds more to the story of the main character Po, and I feel it wraps the series up nicely. I don't really see the need for a fourth film now, I think they should just leave it as-is.I take a point off because Po's former acquaintances get relatively little screen time now, in favor of the new, and another point just because it has to borrow so heavily from the first two films' plots. It was an excellent film overall though, and I was pleased with the studio's efforts. Thanks for not making the film just-another-cash-grab."
32,Kung Fu Panda 3,5,30 January 2016,Great,"I just got back from watching the movie in theaters and it was pretty good (way better than I thought it would be) I liked the story line, and most of the characters. The one I didn't like, and most people would agree, is Mei Mei (lol) Any one else think she's creepy? I actually didn't think they needed another movie, but it introduced a lot of Po's background. To tell the truth I thought a lot of it was stupid (I think they meant to make it that way) Well I need a last line so, I give this movie a 5 out of 10 because its not the best movie I've seen (not the worst I've seen either) Great movie for the kids, an all-around funny movie :)"
33,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,31 January 2016,Almost as good as the original,"The story has more then single level. And while all planes are simple by themselves, they give a nice aftertaste. Which is rare for kid movie.The dynamic is awesome. I kept silly grin almost all the time through the movie.Overall very nice experience. Few things left to wish for, that you will find hard to point exactly at.You may read in some reviews that story is way too simple. Well, as I said - each plane by itself is simple and may be a little too schematic. But follow them all and you will see a bigger picture."
34,Kung Fu Panda 3,5,27 February 2016,Not even close to the 2nd or even 1st one,"The story is identical to the second one, they just used fewer jokes. Again its about Po needing to figure out who he really is and that all his powers come from within and from his friends. While the first and second movies were also great for adults, this one is only for children. Even for adults who like most animation movies this movie just feels stupid. They should have stopped after the second one and let the franchise die with dignity.Overall you might find a handful of laughs and some *exhale-heavily-thru- the-nose*. Most of the jokes have been recycled from 1 and 2, especially the fat panda jokes.I admit the bad guy is better than the bad guys in part one and two, yet he has to few lines to actually matter."
35,Kung Fu Panda 3,5,6 February 2016,Missing the Unique Spirit of the First Two,"The third film in Dreamworks enduring martial-arts-comedy franchise has managed the near impossibility of being simultaneously too predictable and too nonsensical. As a fan of the first two films, I often found myself defending them against detractors who claimed they were too prone to the narrative downfall of the ""deus-ex-machina"" (an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation). With Panda 3, that fight has become too much to wage. With story beats that are beyond lazy, we've abandoned the majestic fighting of the first 2, leaving us with nothing but childish humor and tons of unearned yet expected emotions. The story finds Po (played by the ever-perfect-for-the-role Black) trying to best a particularly tough new baddie, all the while discovering that his birth-dad is still alive and residing within a hidden community full of pandas. The new villain has a completely inexplicable backstory, but is mostly cool enough to make up for it, and the village of bears is plenty cute and funny. It even provides a respectable example of non-traditional parenting for modern times. Unfortunately, it's all surrounded by the tired ""be yourself"" morality that kid's films can't seem to get away from. Sure, the animation is as beautiful as ever, the score is cool, and there are a handful of genuine belly laughs. Unfortunately, the overpowering sense of laziness in the script drags down this otherwise successful family outing, a product of trying to squeeze too many stories from one small beginning. Kung Fu Panda 3 is missing the unique spirit of comedic fun and adventure that bolstered the previous two films to the top of the Dreamworks animation stable."
36,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,14 February 2016,"Amazing Visuals, Beautiful Soundtrack, Above Average Movie","Kung Fu Panda 3 is the third installment of the (hopefully) six-part Kung Fu Panda series. It is common knowledge that the Kung Fu Panda series has marvelous visuals. Somehow, though, Dreamworks managed to create a much more visually appealing movie compared to its predecessors. The amount of detail put into every single frame had me in awe the entire time. From the scene where Po and the Furious 5 are running through the rooftops of The Valley of Peace, to the the Panda Village high up in the mountains, Kung Fu Panda 3 will leave you with your jaw's dropped and eyes wide with amazement.One great thing about Dreamworks movies are the soundtracks that go along with them. Kung Fu Panda 3 is not an exception to this. With a score created by Hans Zimmer, the soundtrack does not disappoint. The music fits perfectly with the setting it's placed in and brings a whole new dimension along with it.My personal favorites are ""The Battle of Legends"" (Which plays when Po, the pandas, Mr. Ping, and Tigress are fighting Kai and the Jaded Warriors), and ""The Spirit Realm"" (Which plays when Kai and Po are in the Spirit Realm, before Po finds out who he really is). I also like how in the end, they played an orchestrated version of ""Kung Fu Fighting"" along with Chinese and English lyrics.(The soundtrack can be found on Youtube)The story was not bad, but it was also not great. The first half (before entering the Panda village) was very cheesy. The jokes felt pretty rushed and dull. Sure there were funny jokes here and there, but for the most part, the first had left me rolling my eyes. The second half was much better since there was less cheese and more seriousness.Visuals - 10/10 Music - 10/10 Story - 7/10Overall - 9/10"
37,Kung Fu Panda 3,4,26 February 2016,Very Poor and Unnecessary Sequel,"Personally, I don't understand how Kung Fu Panda 3 has a higher IMDb rating than the first or second films. Maybe as more people rate it, that number will drop but don't take it as representing the quality of the film. I could rant endlessly about what was wrong with this film but instead I'll just say this: If you've seen the first two films, then just assume that you've seen this one as well. Apart from the addition of Bryan Cranston, this film hasn't changed much. Even the humour in this one appears to be sadly lacking in relation to the previous two. This sequel makes the same error that all sequels are making these days. They follow a formula to make this film exactly the same as the previous ones, just with a slightly altered storyline e.g. a new villain who has never been mentioned previously."
38,Kung Fu Panda 3,3,29 January 2016,kids cartoon,"the animation is beautiful, seriously, some of it looks real; the ground, grass, cherry blossoms, hairs on the characters ... the list goes on, truly an awesome job on the animation. the plot was great, if I had read a short plot of this movie I would have said 'Yes I want to see this' I Loved the first two movies so much that I contemplated getting a kung fu panda tattoo, I love China and everything about it; it's history, culture, guilin mountains, obviously cherry blossoms even fiction about China, one of my favorite books is 'bridge of birds' and I love james hong's voice, he's in the top 4; james earl jones, morgan freeman, jen taylor and james hong. but everything else about the movie I didn't like, the joke writers were juvenile and story writers were pedestrian. 3 out of 10."
39,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,6 February 2016,"Not as good as the second, but still enjoyable","So, I've been waiting for this movie since I saw the second in 2011. I figured that this one wouldn't compare to that one, but I knew I'd be content if I just enjoyed it more than the first. I did.The message of the movie is somewhat repetitive the one from the second movie, dealing with that question of ""Who am I?"" But I was fine with that because I figured that Po would have a little soul-searching to do with the arrival of his birth dad.I went to see this movie three times, one of which was a 3D showing, in order to make sure I noticed as much as possible. I have to say the visuals for this movie are really good, probably the best of the three films. I don't usually pay for 3D, but I thought it was a pretty neat thing to see. The music was particularly fantastic. I was upset to discover that John Powell wouldn't be returning, but Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe made a great score, which touched a chord quite frequently.On to the movie. It was funny. Not hilarious, but I never really watched these movies with the expectation that I'd laugh my guts out. It was still amusing. I enjoyed the emotional parts of the movie the most. Mr. Ping giving Li a pep talk. The scene where it looked like Kai was going to take everyone's chi in the panda village after Po failed to beat him. The moment when Po almost became a jombie and is saved by everyone's chi. One thing I'm impressed with is that the Furious Five actually speak more in this with the exception of Viper. I wasn't happy that they were sidelined and that Tigress was put in the spotlight again (although she is my favorite). But I thought they had decent lines for the amount of time in which they were present.I only have one major concern with this movie. I found myself wondering why Kai all of sudden turned rotten and began stealing the pandas' chi. Was he always a little power hungry? Did something happen in the village that influenced this sudden turn of events. Maybe a little more background on him would've cleared this up a little more. Besides that, I liked him. Kai was funny and being a spirit warrior made him a challenging opponent.Overall, it's a fun and visually-appealing movie to watch."
40,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,1 February 2016,Could be my favorite Panda movie of the franchise.,"SOooo.. we went and saw Kung Fu Panda 3. It was AWESOME. It could very well be my favorite in the Panda series. The villain was REALLY well animated and his design ROCKED. The art direction was simply stunning and the movie was the perfect balance of thrilling kung fu action and silly comedy. Ever time it felt like the tone could be getting too serious and dark,, it would lighten right back up again and make you laugh - not in a trite way, but in a way that felt really suited to the tone of the Panda movies. My 4 year old daughter loved it and even my son, at 17 mos old, who kept getting tired of sitting still, would continually get pulled back into the movie by the awesome action. After the movie, the kids WERE Kung fu pandas for quite a while, it was adorable. GO SEE this movie!! I am sure we will see it again. I also LOVED the use of the Imagine Dragon's song ""I'm so sorry"" as Kai's theme.. its totally baddass and PERFECT for a Kung fu villain. loved it. go see it."
41,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,31 January 2016,Fun but all to familiar.,"'Kung Fu Panda 3' is, of course, the newest chapter in the Panda trilogy. This one, much like the others, plays off of its predecessors. With 'Kung Fu Panda 3' the Dragon Warrior finally meets his father. His real father for that matter. This naturally throws off the mojo of everyone around him. Especially his goose step father....thing. Aside from this singular plot point this film is nearly identical in structure to its predecessors. Po is asked to accomplish a seemingly impossible task with in a paper thin time frame and as he is going about this he (for some reason) has a sort of identity crisis. And, just as the story needs him to, he over comes right on time.If you think you've heard this plot line before, you have. It's in every single Disney sports movie ever. It's the same formula used in the first two films as well. Yet, somehow, the first two are actually a whole lot of fun with a surprising amount of depth. The first two were bright, fun, and big but never sacrificed character or depth.Unfortunately, 'Kung Fu Panda 3' does. The biggest issue I had with this film outside of the recycled structure was the villain. Each prior film had a menacing but clearly motivated villain for Po to face. While this one doesn't lack menace, his motives and past are fairly unclear. It doesn't help that Kai's ""chi"" abilities go rather unexplained. Each time he appears on screen he seems to have a new muddled ability that helps him defeat each opponent in his path. Again, the film does a great job of making him scary but it doesn't even try to make him feel like a threat. Mainly because, if you've seen the first two, you already know what is going to happen. This robs the movie of any twists that it attempts, which makes this absurdly predictable.Now, don't get the wrong idea, I actually enjoyed this movie. But I think it's important to recognize that it has issues, and a lot of them. That being said, this is probably the best movie you and your kids can watch right. 'Inside Out' is too smart for kids, 'Norm of the North' is too bland, and 'Shaun the Sheep' is too quiet. 'Kung Fu Panda 3' is quite the opposite, in many regards, of all of these. It's scale is big, the jokes fly with insane speed, and the animation is bright and breathtaking. It is one of the few movies left that is utterly harmless. But it also has something to say. Much like the two before it, 'Kung Fu Panda 3' talks a lot about self worth.It tells young children that it's OK to be different and that the best you, is you. No matter what any one else says. For these few reasons, I believe 'Kung Fu Panda 3' is on the better end of family movies and definitely worth (at least) a watch, despite its cookie cutter storytelling."
42,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,29 January 2016,Absurdly Spectacular,"The marketing led to me to believe that this would be sub-par to the first two - a quick buck off a franchise name.I'm glad to see I was horribly wrong.This is one of the best animated films I have ever seen. Another reviewer referred to it as the ""Return of The King"" of its series, and I can't say that I contest that. It's that good.The pacing is done so well that what runs at one hour and 35 minutes feels like a two hour film, but not in a bad way. Not at all. The depth and design of the film give it the feel of an expanded ""universe"" in the sense that it ties in incredibly well with the first two... and amplifies them. The humor was spot-on - no cheesy slapstick or distasteful cheap laughs. It was solid juxtaposition and well-timed - truly some great jokes and humorous situations that were well-placed. The humor goes a long way in disseminating sad scenes or driving the plot further, in a creative way.All of the voice acting was fantastic. Each actor really nailed his or her character, again testifying to the depth of the picture. Lastly, the animation was phenomenal, and not just purely graphically, it was also fairly creative/innovative. Numerous ""montage"" scenes are present in the film (along with a few well-done flashbacks - tying into the previous two films), and the art design is superb. There are parts that feel like a moving painting in the best way.I'm hoping that this will do very well at the box office. It absolutely deserves it, and if not, I know that this will do well on Blu-Ray. How creative of Dreamworks to release this in January, where it faces little competition. It gets my solid 10 out of 10, and I definitely would see it again in theaters. A+ film."
43,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,1 February 2016,The Next Great Franchise is Upon Us! Skudoosh!!,"So far this film completes a very fun and very solidly made franchise that will go nicely with my Kung Fu Panda collection. DreamWorks really impressed me with this one. Proving that Shrek the Third was just a hiccup (no pun intended). And I love it when I struggle to say which film is the best out of the franchise, that means they made a great franchise. One thing that DreamWorks knows how to do is keep you guessing. People always assume the film is going to do badly but actually ends up hitting a home run, this is no exception. If DreamWorks keeps this up, they can overrun Pixar as they are going through a weak time right now with the exception of Inside Out. DreamWorks continues to impress with year after year of good to great films. Heck I think Home is better then Cars 2. Now what stands out about the film itself is it isn't afraid to take chances. And more times then not actually ends up paying off. The voice talent is well, talented. Each character whether its returning ones or new ones each of them does a marvelous job. Bryan Cranston, Kate Hudson, and especially J.K. Simmons who literally blends into the character. I couldn't imagine him talking behind the microphone because he didn't use his actual voice rather made the character his. The negatives I have is that it doesn't spend time with the characters we've come to enjoy. Tigress even though she was in it more then the other Furious Fives, but I still would like to see her in action more then they did. They completely shun the other characters like Viper, Mantis, Crane, and Monkey. They sort of pushed them aside and made room for the newer characters. Which is fine, but after coming to know and love these characters especially Tigress, I would liked to have seen more from them. Also, the story seems overdone especially the villain. Even though I like J.K. Simmons as the character, the character himself is just Ti Lung all over again (sorry if I misspelled his name). And is the third time a villain has underestimated Po with the same question, ""Is he the one destined to stop me?"" Or something along those lines. But despite those mistakes the film makes up in shire courage. DreamWorks could have easily been lazy and made this another Shrek the Third, but thank heavens it wasn't that. I had a lot of fun watching this as a full grown adult, so kids should have a blast with this film. Like in DreamWorks fashion this is a film worthy of the entire family and you deserve it so you can get the bad taste of Norm of the North out of your mouths. This is how animated film are meant to be. DreamWorks proves they are still one of the best in the business, maybe the best right now. Check it out, you will regret it if you don't. Now to grade: Animation: A+ Characters: A Voice Acting: A Story: B+ Risk Value: A+ Music: A- (Best score by Hans Zimmer in a long time.) Overall: A"
44,Kung Fu Panda 3,4,13 September 2017,"Third movie, third best","I really enjoyed the first Kung Fu Panda movie and liked the second, but I didn't like this one. It didn't meet up to the others, and I seriously laughed only three times. Or was it two? There was a creative new conflict, but something was real disturbing in the movie, something to do with spirits. It is not that didn't dislike the religion and therefore didn't enjoy it; I didn't enjoy it and therefore disliked the religion. Again, it was disturbing. There were things to do with the dead and spirits. Not the sort of movie worth watching in the theater and then eagerly seeing again at home."
45,Kung Fu Panda 3,4,11 April 2017,Least favorite of the series,"This movie was probably my least favorite of the series. It was fun, but very distracting. It is obvious that the idea for Master Kai's weapons, were taken straight from the God of War video game series. Kai is in the Spirit World. And he has blades that can control the spirits of the masters he defeats. And the blades are attached to his wrists by a chain a mystical chain. While Kratos's Blades of Exile are not green and cant control spirits, they do attached to his wrist by a mystical chain. And cant be removed by himself. Much like Kai's. But the Claw of Hades (also from God of War) can control the spirits of the underworld, much like Master Kai's can control the chi orbs of the Masters that Kai has defeated. They just combined the two weapons into one. So they entire movie, I thought I was watching ""This Ain't God of War. Panda Edition""Wasn't the only thing wrong, but its what was most distracting."
46,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,16 December 2016,Inspiration is... skadoosh!,"Too bad, just when you think you can retire and lead a peaceful afterlife, there's a villain you defeated half a millennium ago asking for a rematch, even Kung Fu Masters can't get a break! Poor Master Oogway is quietly meditating when he's interrupted by Kai (JK Simmons) a Master (buffalo?) previously banished to the Spirit Realm (a nice euphemism for killed). Kai found a way to get back to the Real World, by using the chi, a sort of 'life essence' loading you with the skills and power of your opponents, and turning them in the process into jade charms or eventually ""jombies"". ""it It ain't over till it's over"", I know it's a sport, but Kung Fu sure moves in mysterious ways. Still, can we blame the writers for trying hard to justify a sequel?Let's just admit that Po is so likable and irresistible that there was no way his series would escape from the magic three even though ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" was such a fantastic experience that I didn't think another sequel could outshine it and the third one confirmed my doubts. It was quite a signal when the only part I didn't like from the second was the concluding revelation of Po's father being alive. I thought the story of Po's origins added to the tragic dimension of this character as he ceased to be this jovial and leading comic relief and became a three-dimensional character whose personality was profoundly shaped by the past. And to a certain extent, the revelation that not only his father but also the whole village was alive turned the big scar into a rather benign scratch. Now I understand it was the only possible path the writers could take to justify any continuation to Po's existential journey and to come full circle with it. This is not unusual with DreamWorks films since many first sequels dealt with family reunions like ""Shrek"" with Princess Fiona and ""Madagascar"" with the trip to Africa, but ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" managed to explore the origins without relying on the obvious, it brought up a new, fresh and evil villain, and it only gave a slight glimpse on Po's past but even the tiny bit we had was emotionally overwhelming. But ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" takes the easy, predictable way, and while the film is enjoyable on many levels, it doesn't bring any particular surprise.The first encounter with the father (Bryan Cranston) was promising but as soon as they got to the Panda's village, their relationship kind of diluted in that huge population who overcrowded the film and even the story. I liked the pandas and the way they actually had more in common with Po and he stopped being an outcast, but in the meantime, I felt we were just watching Po trying to become the one he was in the beginning of ""Kung Fu Panda"". It was like a 180° turn in his character's arc. The story tries to wrap this Panda's ""back to sources"" up with the whole quest for the chi's technique, but the chi thing is just a MacGuffin and doesn't even have that emotional resonance the ""inner peace"" had in the second. Actually, it even diminishes the impact of inner peace, as if each new film would come with a new device outshining the former. Well I have nothing against the jombies or the chi, and damn, I loved that ""skadoosh"" device, but I don't know, there was something just so  routinely about the film, nothing transcending. There wasn't a particular scene that stood out as an original moment: Po encountering the other pandas exuded the same vibes than the animals in ""Madagascar 2"", especially Marty with the zebras, except that the zebras were funnier. The ""find yourself"" thing had too much in common from Alex defeating the bad guy with dancing, the only thing he knew. And the afterlife looked like something from outer space that really derailed the story, and the writers kept making new rules each time, so even within the film's logic, some things didn't make sense. To list a few: why the Skadoosh would also take Kai to the Spirit Realm? Why wouldn't the team be angry for the mess Po and his father caused in the museum? And why oh why, didn't Po meet his mother in the afterlife? Now, that was the emotional moment the film was begging for, apart from the father, there was no panda sympathetic enough so you could handle them for more than ten seconds, they even looked too overweight and not as cute as cuddly as they generally are. Seriously, could they have drawn them any uglier? But not meeting his mother was the biggest miss of the film, the emotional pinnacle. I guess they were in a rush to conclude the film with the obvious ""Kung Fu Fighting"" and that's how the whole experience felt, something made in a rush. Definitely more ""skadoosh"" than ""inner peace"" material."
47,Kung Fu Panda 3,3,3 July 2016,Good enough,"Paw is the dragon warrior and he had saved China. So this time he has to become a teacher. Plus, as the second movie had suggested, he has to find his real family. The movie is not as good as the previous two had been. It's hardly funny and the story seems to have been copy paste from the first one. Though the family reunion seemed promising, it failed to entertain. Actually the conflict between the two dads, the goose and the panda, was more interesting than the whole remaking the panda in Paw. The actions scenes were okay, not too much thankfully, and they started from the second half, which made the first half kind of boring to some point. So, 3 out of 10, because I was really looking forward for this movie and it didn't live up to its prequels."
48,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,13 March 2016,Decent and fun addition to the series,"The second installment tackled mainly the story of Po, particularly about his origin and what happened to his parents. This is another journey in ""getting to know oneself"" story-line, and in this third installment, a similar story-line was told. Albeit similar, it was rather told in another level of perspective, a supposedly more profound perspective. More profound in a sense that the knowledge of oneself reaches a certain threshold such that the responsibility to share it with others comes in at a ripe time and becomes another level of journey in ""getting to know oneself"". Then, it becomes pedagogical, and the film's story shows us a compelling idea of the true meaning of teaching. Teaching in a sense that you transform others, not to become like the teacher, but to become like themselves with their own potentials realized. Compelling as it may seem, the way of telling in this third installment is rather too simplistic given the weight of the perspective being tackled. It falls quite short of the depth that the first movie has given us despite the similarly comical approach that characterizes a Kung Fu Panda movie. Despite this little ""disappointment"", the movie was rather enjoyable, and the introduction of new characters and a new place was rather refreshing. The pitfall, however, is that the villain was kind of boring, wherein nothing is really different from the same greedy villain we saw in the second movie. And also, the movie feels a little bit short in a sense that the pacing was fast, and we had the eventual confrontation between the villain and the hero too soon before we get fully satisfied with the laughs, the action scenes, and the weighty story. In short, the movie kind of left us asking for more. Despite all of these, I still would like to say that the third installment is a decent and an enjoyable addition to the Kung Fu Panda series."
49,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,29 January 2016,I heard some Kung Fun Masters can win a battle just with a dramatic entrance.,"Dreamworks has brought us another installment to the awesome Kung Fu Panda series, but this time they have made it in conjunction with the Chinese government who co-funded it. The vibrant visuals, whimsical world, and colorful characters that define this series are once again at play and as strong as ever, but with a script that(while competent) is below the standard of the first two.Picking up where the last film left off, Po's father(Li) returns to find his long lost son. The clash between adoptive father Mr. Ping and birth father Li is a great idea, but not properly played out given the potential. To complicate our hero's life, Master Oogway's old nemesis Kai has returned to threaten the Jade Temple. Kai is not the best of the Panda villains, but his setup is well thought out, and with the increased focus on Po's search for identity, I can't complain.So why am I rating this an 8 when the story is the weakest of the three movies? Simple, Kung Fu Panda 3 has beautiful imagery, superb direction, and stunningly choreographed fights(true visual artistry.) All of which rival the previous two films or surpass them. The 3D is expertly worked in, and truly adds to the films enjoyment. If you like the Kung Fu Panda series, then check it out, but don't expect the narrative heights of the last two."
50,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,19 February 2016,Twizard Rating: 76,"Everything happens so fast in this new Kung Fu Panda installment, just like it did for the previous two. Though hardly necessary, the people seem to respond well to continuing this franchise, so here it is.When kung fu warrior, Po (Jack Black), meets his long lost father, he gets invited to follow him to the secret land of pandas. Meanwhile, the evil spirit warrior, Kai (J.K. Simmons), is trying to defeat every kung fu master, stealing their powers. While none of this is connected to the first two movies, the tone definitely is. We're still given that animated slapstick comedy that these films excel at so well. But there's way too much happening at once, and the jokes are always amidst the action, hardly ever giving us a chance to breathe.Overstimulation aside, the aesthetics are really what carry us through to the end. Without them, this movie would feel very void of any character at all. Every bit of scenery is beautiful and you wish there was a secret panda land that you, too, could visit.Getting through the by-the-numbers first act is probably the biggest challenge here. Scenes seem added only for the purpose of entertainment without actually enhancing the script. And a dozen new characters get introduced, raising the head count, but dropping any depth that gives us a reason to be invested.For a family movie, it's very heavy on the details. But Po is stupid enough that he has to ask questions so that we, the audience, can understand things--you know, just in case we don't.Kung Fu Panda is cheesy and silly, but still entertaining. It's also a movie for kids, and based on the box office results, I'd say they hit their mark.Twizard Rating: 76"
51,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,31 January 2016,A movie that is supposed to be made by China,"(This review is including all three Kung Fu panda movies)""If you are a big fan of Chinese Kung Fu, if you are a big fan of Chinese culture, and if you are a big of Chinese panda, the movie Kung Fu Panda would be the most recommended for you. China is perfectly showing the world itself by using this excellent Chinese movie. The panda, the Kung Fu, the dragon, the building, the food and so on, all of these are really signature Chinese stuffs."" Unfortunately, you have to exchange the worlds ""Chinese movie"" with ""American movie"". Yes, this so Chinese style movie, even me as a Chinese people is so impressed, is fully made in American! (well, not that ""fully"" I think, but ""mainly"") We have made a plenty of movies that could really show the Chinese culture, as the quality is not high, so the influence is not much. But what make me so shocked is that people all over the world would know about China is by watching a movie made by America, Doesn't it sound unnatural? when a Chinese people hear someone sail, ""wow, this is China."" Doesn't it sound weird? I know many people would say the America would distort the culture, would send the wrong messages to the audience, would control the impression of Chinese culture. However, these are all not truth, the one of things that make me so emotional is that this contents from this movie are so positive, so traditional, so Chinese. I have to say even me would feel like that many Chinese spirits in this movie are expressed so reasonable, so many Kung Fu actions are quite fantastic, the characters choosing is appropriate-like the panda.And they are supposed to be created by Chinese makers.As a Chinese people, I have to give the American some credit for making such a great movie about Chinese culture. Movie is one the most important media industries, Chinese people have to realize that if we don't keep working on our film industry, if we don't keep improving the culture industry, if we don't keep increasing the influence of the Chinese movie, then our stories would be told by someone else mouth."
52,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,8 February 2016,Was it worth the wait?,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is directed by Alesandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh. The movie stars Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, J.K. Simmons, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and many more great actors and actresses. First off, when I heard the were actually doing a third one, I was a little worried because it's been so long since the second one. In the end my worries were completely wrong and Kung Fu Panda 3 was great. The animation, acting, soundtrack was amazing and it felt great to be back in this world. Jack Black as Po is always great but this movie had a great villain also. Having J.K. Simmons as the villain was just fantastic. The theme for the villain was just as great as he was. The animation was Fantastic, best animation in the series yet. The only problems I had with the movie was that once the movie started, you know where it's going and how's it going to end but you can still have fun with the movie. Overall Kung Fu Panda 3 was another movie in this series. The animation, actions, and everything was great as before. It didn't bring anything new to the table but you can still have a lot of fun with it."
53,Kung Fu Panda 3,,29 January 2016,"Fast-paced, colorful, great 3D effects ...","This fun movie starts at a brisk pace and continues till the end ... kind of like it's catering to an ADHD crowd. There's a constant flow rolling, tumbling, flying, running and crashing. And if that's not enough, at several points in the movie, the screen actually splits into 3 parts with things happening in each pane. If you like 3D effects, it's worth the extra charge ... this movie makes great use of the technology. It's colorful and visually eye catching throughout. Only thing that I would have liked is a bit more character development. Because of it, the evolution of Po (the panda / dragon warrior) is not as powerful and moving as it was in the previous two movies. Well, I guess you can't have everything -- but I'm fine with it. We get another great adventure in the ""Kung Fu Panda"" world for a 3rd time -- and that's quite sufficient for me."
54,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,16 February 2016,The next chapter of the furious five,"In the third installment of the awesome Kung fu panda series, a new enemy Kai escapes the spirit realm by stealing the chi of the Kung fu masters as way of returning to the mortal world. Meanwhile mister shifu is considering retirement and passes on the teachings of Kung fu to po. While the first teaching turns into a disaster but pro ends up being reunited with his biological father li at a dumpling contest. Pro also gets the chance to also meet the pandas at the village where they are living. What makes pop a great character is now he matured in the dragon warrio that he was meant to be and brings about his Kung fun journey full circle. It also reveals the past of master ooguay as well."
55,Kung Fu Panda 3,5,5 February 2016,Not bad,"I was eager to see if Kung Fu Panda 3 could live up to its two predecessors, as they are two of my favorite animated films. However, while the first two movies had perfect balance in their assets, this installment seems to have its focus on only one thing: the message, making it the cheesiest of the three, and one that made sacrifices of its better aspects.This bothered me to a degree, as the action scenes it had were tremendously well-done; Kai's powers made for some unique choreography. Unfortunately, some fights are cut short, most notably the scene in the desert where Kai takes on Master Bear, Chicken, Croc, Crane, and Mantis; one that I was very excited to see before it only turned out to show flashes of green and the brief capture of Crane.I was also astounded by Kung Fu Panda 3's visuals. It's easily one of the best-looking animated films for its time. However, there are several instances where the movie seems to transition to a minimalist style. This works well for the intro sequence and Shifu's reading of the scroll, of course, but it was certainly disappointing to see the minimalism come in during the Panda Village training montage, and even more-so to see it during the final battle in the spirit realm.Overall, this movie is one worth seeing, especially if you liked the other two. The new characters are very likable and/or memorable, the action scenes are unique and enticing. However, the cheesy message of the film made for some cop-outs in the plot (the pandas unlock their Chi powers in the end by ""just being themselves""), and the visuals, although good-looking, seem phoned in at times."
56,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,30 January 2016,Another Legend of Awesomeness,"SKADOOSH! A word that seems to hold no meaning for many was the trademark word for an animated film franchise that's beloved by many. Kung-Fu Panda is a tale about Po the clumsy, food loving panda who also is a master of martial arts. Over the last eight years, Po and his fellow animal fighters have tackled one overlord after another to save China. And this weekend yet another villain rears it's anthropomorphic head to face our heroes. However can a third adventure maintain the fun its predecessors have or does it flop like so many sequels? Kung-Fu Panda's animation remains as phenomenal as ever, with Po and company zipping about in fluid motion. Both human and animalistic motions are flawlessly blended together to bring our anthropomorphic cast alive and in stunning detail and color. This quality remains even during the fast paced G-rated action scenes of Kung-Fu and comical chaos. Of course fans of the series know that Po's main angle is comedy in terms of entertaining our younger audience members. Kung-Fu Panda 3 has plenty of laughable moments as Po's enthusiasm and clumsiness leads to many situations that filled the audience with high pitched squeals. Running into walls, screaming in overdramatic voices, and goofy, thought cute, faces are the ploys they unleash. Fortunately there are some well-written lines, great delivery, and a few advanced jokes that add a little wit to the mix. And like any good animated feature, this movie also brings about some emotional moments to grab you into the story. Morals, especially those geared towards finding your self, are integrated into the excitement and add some more depth to Po. Seeing Po reunited with his kind starts pulling the heartstrings, and the interactions with his dad (combined with the powerful musical score) nearly brought tears to my eyes. While some moments are a little on the preachy/cheesy side, the story team did a nice job teaching the lessons that we can all stand to learn. While all of these animation tactics work to bring the movie the life, it would still be nothing without the voice acting. Jack Black's goofiness works great with Po and is perfect for the comedy aspect of the film, while also transitioning into a more serious tone when the scene calls for it. The new comers to the series are well received in this movie. Bryan Cranston as Po's father was a different role for him and interesting to see considering his last few roles were much more intense. J.K. Simmons as the bad guy was a perfect choice as his gruff tone and history of being a stubborn hard head fell right in line with his animal. Our other cast members reprise their roles with the same ferocity and fun they had back in the other films. In terms of what could be improved in this movie there were a few things I would have liked to see. First is that the opening segment was a bit rushed, the rise of the master villain happening much faster than I expected. As a result the training and morals of Po were also a little hasty in development and lacked the same emotional punch of the first two. I felt they also put the other animals in the background again with only Tigress really getting the screen time worthy of billing. Comedy wise some of the ploys did get old after a bit, some of the new jokes getting overused like so many memes in the Internet generation. The action I didn't think was as good as Kung Fu Panda 2, especially when it turns into the grandiose display of color than actual martial arts prowess. Overall Kung-Fu Panda 3 is another notch on the belt of awesome goodness in Dreamworks productions. It is fun, funny, and maintains the fun story elements that we fell in love with all those years ago. For a third installment this is one of the better ones I have seen, and is a strong start to the family movie genre in 2016. I strongly encourage everyone to take a trip to the theater for this adventure. My scores for Kung Fu Panda 3 are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0"
57,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,29 January 2016,Quite artistic but the movie is aimed at kids.,"I gave it a 10 because my nieces and nephews loved it, I got quite a few of them.One of them wanted me to give it a '20 bagillion stars on that movie website.' They all listened to the theme by Hans Zimmer while on the way to the theater. They were excited and they enjoyed the movie. Some of the scenes were brilliant in how they blended 2d animation with 3d animation.Quite artistic but the movie is definitely for kids more than than adults. Story is lacking. But looking at all my nieces/nephews enjoying it I felt I should review it more for the kids I went with than for cynical beings like me. They liked this more than Inside out and Good Dinosaur. But then again are pixar movies aimed at kids? Pixar always seems to have someone die in their movies. Dreamworks doesn't .I am hoping this grosses in a lot of money so Dreamworks can keep on making more movies for kids."
58,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,29 January 2016,awesome movie,"Kung Fu Panda 3 does not disappoint. It has great animation, great music, and a great story. We loved it. My son, who is 9, enjoyed the story and thought the movie was very funny. The panda theme was adorable as pandas are cute animals. Also, the scary guy wasn't that scary - and was more funny. Jack Black is hilarious and everyone in the theater was laughing. There were some sad moments and some happy moments but you leave the theater feeling uplifted. If you like action movies, you will like this because many things explode but there is no gore. The colors of the film are quite beautiful and lush. Go see it! You will enjoy it. Take your kids."
59,Kung Fu Panda 3,5,19 March 2016,Good But Predictable,Today went to see this wasn't expecting much from the film but haven't seen the second film but was aware of the film area of focus. If you have young children then you will enjoy this film. However if your an adult it's a pretty simple film an you can often work out what might happen next. Few scenes where we had the classic sad story but all end is good. I feel the whole thing was very basic and nothing special if my girlfriend didn't have a thing for pandas wouldn't have seen this. Jack Black plays very well and has a great group of supporting cast with some known names. Will have to see the other film before this but was very good with it's colours and could understand why this would be liked by a younger child audience. If you have kids they will adore this but you will need find many jokes for the mums and dads. I love animation but this isn't anywhere near as good as a Disney film.
60,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,29 December 2017,oh boooooooooooooyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was a awesome movie to watch i watch about 4 times it has good action in the movie PO has learn many things through out the movie and it was a great experienced for him also he goes through a difficult journey also he learns how to harness he new technique to fight a new mysterious foe in the movie also he meets new friends overall this was a great movie to watch
61,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,7 December 2017,A very epic and satisfying conclusion.,"There are two animation studios out there that know how to make their sequels better than the original movie. The first one is notably Pixar and the second in my opinion is DreamWorks. Most of the sequels they have done in their franchises notable their second movies have stunned me by how they improved upon their predecessors. ""Kung Fu Panda"" was no exception. The second film not only stepped up the comedy and action, but really succeeded in its drama. So when they announced a third movie, I was both eagerly excited and yet very nervous due to having bad memories of ""Shrek the Third."" I went in the feeling the same and left very satisfied. ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is easily the best out of the franchise as it does contain all of the elements that made the second film fantastic and builds to make a very satisfying conclusion to the series.The dragon warrior Po (Jack Black) has been given his final lesson by Mater Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) in this case learning the art of Chi so then he can take on his role as teacher of the Furious Five (Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan, David Cross and Seth Rogan respectively). He realizes very quickly though that he is not a good teacher and tries to set out how he can find himself. During all the hubbub though, his biological father Li Shan (Bryan Cranston) finally reunites with his son and tells him of a secret panda village high above the mountains, much to the jealousy of Po's adopted father, Mr. Ping (James Hong). However, an evil yak from the spirit world named Kai (J.K. Simmons) returns to the mortal world and is out to destroy everything his former friend Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) had accomplished, notably taking away the Chi of the kung fu warriors he trained and turning them into jade zombies. Knowing he's near, Po must find out how to learn the art of Chi from the pandas and defeat Kai before all the warriors are captured.The story is certainly the best element of the film. It once again steps up the comedy, and drama of the second film (even showing us the saddest scene again) but what the film really stepped up is the action. Oh wow, is the action suspenseful. This was easily what the films were building up to. The battles in this film are just epic. They keep you on the edge of your seat and make you worried about the characters, though they still throw in some comedy to keep the laughs coming. The climatic battle at the end, which I dare not spoil, is honestly one of the best action scenes put in animated film ever. The animation is yet again beautiful. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson succeeds once again at blending elements of 2D and 3D animation together perfectly and also creating some beautiful backgrounds. The spirit world in particular was just eye popping. I loved how the colors in the background looked. As for the characters, there once again great particularly the new ones. I really like Li Shan and the other pandas in the village. But by far, the character that really succeeded was Kai. What a fantastic villain! I never thought that he would be able to top Gary Oldman's devious character of Lord Shen but wow, J.K. Simmons knocked this character right out of the park. He's such a devious jerk of a villain yet he still has some comedy to him. He actually did have a very funny line during the final battle that really made me laugh. It's exactly what I expect. ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is yet another example of a great sequel with a fantastic story, beautiful animation and really good characters. This is a really good sequel. I'm pretty sure that DreamWorks will probably stop the series here because I seriously don't know how they will be able to top this. It's just a great sequel and certainly one I'll really remember."
62,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,1 October 2017,Monkey Voice Actor,"Jackie Chan was the voice actor for this movie but for some reason, his voice sound different from other kung fu panda movie. The voice actor from this movie sound almost like from the TV series by James Sie. The fight scene voice sound like jackie chan but other parts doesn't sound like it. Other parts sound like James Sie or other Asian voice actor."
63,Kung Fu Panda 3,4,23 September 2017,Kung Fu Panda 3 wasn't good.,"Nothing in this movie is funny at all. Po is a character, who was amazing, who makes dumb ""jokes"" throughout the whole movie. The character development is weak and the plot should have been more serious. The ""comedy"" in this film ruins the whole movie. The other movies in this series are better than this."
64,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,8 June 2017,It was never about the fighting,"As Tigress says to Po you cant win this with kicks and jabs, and so many reviewers failed to get the point. Ultimately this is about enlightenment and leaving the self behind. Po did not win in the spirit world by defeating his opponent but by giving him what he wanted.Sadly there is simply no straight line to gain enlightenment. It is rare to find people who can come to inhabit the universe like Po and experience the joy that involves.Po's teaching is to be the best ""you"" there is, and get over all the rest. It is sad that more people did not get the message. Frankly the ones who hate this the most reject the message, or they simply prefer the fighting even though it is really not the reason for the movie to exist.Peace"
65,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,6 June 2017,What can be given could also be taken,"Kung Fu panda is funny as always. you can watch these cartoon with family. There combines fight and jokes. I really love second part, so I decided to watch the third. And...I was disappointed. Yes, there was much jokes and fun.... But I love Kung Fu panda because of fight and dynamics.But jokes so excellent and pandas are so cute. However jokes must be free additional not more...Maybe I am too old for cartoons.Actially I love cartoons there are no violence, no vulgarity here. There are all the best here. And there was a magic. OK, not actually magic but chi.It gives great responsibility. You can destroy the world, or create new. It is dilemma. You can healing by giving someone your chi. Kai decided what can be given could also be taken. He decided to tale all chi too himself (it is mad, isn't it?). It was too much for him. Too much power can laid to die. Sometimes people forgot that great power is great responsibility.It must not be forgotten. I love visuals, especially in spirit reality.It is so real. There is so much gold (I love gold).So picturesque, so wonderful. and I really love music,it is so...fantasy. Hans Zimmer made great job. It is so full of life, battle, ...paphos. So I added three songs to my playlist.Coclusion:It is good cartoon for child and his families. It has excellent music and visuals. It has finny jokes. What also need for family watching?"
66,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,11 May 2017,The best of the movies so far...,"I must start by stating that ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is every bit as good as the previous two movies, and then some...This is without a doubt the best of the three story lines told so far, and it is also the movie that had the best jokes and comedies, at least in my opinion.And it is the concept of the story and the way that the story is told that makes it stand that much out in comparison to the previous two movies. There was just something more appealing to the storyline here; perhaps it was the fact that Po got to find other pandas and thus get closer to home.""Kung Fu Panda 3"" has some very nice animation work, just exactly like the previous two movies. And the characters in the movie are all memorable, outstanding, colorful and well-rounded.As an animated movie, voice acting is a crucial part and can often be a make it or break it kind of resolve. And the voice acting in ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" turned out to be good. And they have a very nice ensemble of actors and actresses on the list to do the voices for the colorful animated characters. It is great to see returning voice cast come to bring the characters to life on the screen, and I was especially impressed with Brian Cranston here in this third movie. And believe you me, that this franchise has some easily recognized voices on the list, and quite an impressive list that is.The art work and style is good as well, continuing in the established style of the previous two, so it is very easy to relate to the established character and world in which the move about.If you enjoyed the previous two ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies then you definitely will enjoy ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" as well. And it is quite worth the time and effort to do so.My rating of ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a solid 6 out of 10 stars easily."
67,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,10 April 2017,A lot of fun,"This is a great movie. Kids love it. It starts good, with a lot of fun,Poe finding out that he has a dead and a whole colonies of pandas. Poe struggling to learn the Che, Whole palad's get's destroyed, and at the end get's very emotional with Poe wining over a General Kay. It is Entertainment to the end. We watched it over 10 times at least :-)."
68,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,9 January 2017,Great to have my name in the credits,"If you only do what you can, you will never be more than you are now. Its an honor to work for a movie as great as KFP3. DreamWorks did an awesome job. Must watch movie. Best animation till date. Kung Fu Panda has always been my favorite franchise of all time. Looking forward for a 4th edition of this epic Title, As master Shifu says, Time is just an illusion, there is only the now. Talking about the villain, Kai has return! I guess Kai was the best ever character villain. Way to go Dreamworks!!! Love the Po character given to me as a souvenir for working on this. As Po says, Listen closely because I'm only going to repeat this ten times."
69,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,20 December 2016,fun family franchise,"Oogway loses his battle with General Kai who steals his chi and escapes back to the mortal world. Shifu assigns Po to teach the Furious Five but he's horrible at it. His dumpling eating record is beaten by panda Li Shan who is looking for his lost son. They eventually realize that Po is his son. With Kai defeating every master and stealing their chi, only a master of chi could defeat him. Po struggles to master the art and Li Shan suggests returning to the panda's secret hideaway to learn. Shifu and the Furious Five are taken by Kai. Only Tigress manages to escape to warn Po.I simply like this franchise. I like the characters and I like their heart. It is fun without being too broad. It has touching relationships. The new characters are great. It is bright but not too chaotic. It is fun for the whole family."
70,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,14 December 2016,And again,"You know for a third part this is pretty decent. But it's still beginning to lose its attraction. Or probably will, who knows what they will come up with in part 4? Jack Black seems to enjoy himself, Shi-Fu (aka Jackie Chan) and the rest are having the time of their life voicing those animated animals and their adventures.And as long as the fun factor is high, who am I to tell anyone not to watch a movie like this? The quality is there and any movie trilogy will lose a bit of its grip over time. A new foe is created (literally), a new member joins the ""family"" (nice touch there) and there is still enough of the familiar for anyone who loved the previous entries to keep everyone happy"
71,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,5 December 2016,While it's a good film it doesn't hold a candle to the first two,"I loved the first two kung fu panda movies and I even kinda liked the TV series. The series is well known for it's really fun action packed scenes, gorgeous animation, likable cast of characters and simple yet solid story's. I was really hyped to see this film and see how it would turn out and I gotta say that it was disappointing compared to the first two films in the series. But at the same time It's still enjoyable and it still has a number of good things going for it. For one the animation is the best yet and it looks brilliant. The amount of detail in the textures and fur stand out really well. The music is great tho it doesn't beat the first two films IMO. The action scenes are still fun to watch and are well made and the comedy is still hilarious(tho a bit more kiddy then before). The reasons why I feel as tho this film is the weakest of the trilogy is that it feels more rushed and shorter then before as well as the villain. Kai is a weak bad guy IMO and while his voice is pretty cool and his fighting isn't bad, the character isn't as threatening as Shen or Tai Lung due to the writers making him more comical. The films characters are still voiced by the same cast and they all do a good job and the writing is mostly solid.New characters such as LI and MEI MEI aren't very flashed out and the furious five still don't get to do much.Overall I found it to be a solid film in the series but the story could've been much more."
72,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,19 November 2016,Good but a little disappointing,"The problem with sequels I see is that studios cash in on the franchise and forget that they still have to provide entertainment to the audience. And the more number of sequels, the lesser the entertainment value. The 3rd of the this series and the one film that ties all the ends, KFP3 is good but I felt could have been more entertaining. The one thing I love about this series is that there is an underlying message about finding oneself and the purpose of one's life. I loved the 1st one because it was funny and I admired the 2nd one because it was about finding inner peace. Well, the 3rd is somewhere between. There are not many funny moments and going into one's self is also not much. Add to that is Po's reunion with his Dad and his extended Panda family which has the funny part but too much on emotion. And finally we also come to know why Master Oogway chose the Po as the chosen one. Another problem is the villain. Part 1 and 2 had great villains, Kai is a weak one. He is not menacing and nor has any great reason to be bad. Overall, its good but I wish there was more on inner peace and meaning of life."
73,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,26 October 2016,I love kung fu!!!!!,"At first, i was wondering where they were going because i am used to seeing po with the five from watching legends of awesomeness. I was waiting for the sarcastic remarks from mantis, the tricks from monkey and the scowl of tigress. I love them thrown in for comic relief, but since po went his own way, i wondered if they would have a storyline. It was not what i had hoped, but it was good. Po and the five go together. I did like it when he found the other pandas and they taught him to be him. It was hard since he was training at the palace. It was funny watching him, but the best was the ending when po learns to do what he needs and Shifu says, ""of course you did""."
74,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,10 September 2016,Po's journey continues,"One of the things I appreciate about the Kung Fu Panda movies is that the main character is on a continuing journey. Some movie sequels just more-or-less reset their characters for every movie, but Po went from bumbling nobody to hero in the first, then continued and improved as hero in the second, and reaches a new level in 3; it's clear if they keep making movies he will wind up being the grand old master (at which point he'll need to find a bumbler of his own to train.The movie is, like the previous ones, lots of fun, although it feels a bit less substantial. There are a lot of characters, but few are given focus. The eventual focus is around a hidden village, and the way the villagers unknown skills are revealed is one of the best aspects of the movie.It's funny, well animated, and makes me ready for Kung Fu Panda 4."
75,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,6 September 2016,Not a bad chapter in the Kung Fu Panda trilogy.,"This is Dreamworks' second animated sequel to ""Kung Fu Panda,"" a story about noodle-shop worker-turned Dragon Warrior Po Ping, a giant panda. He reunites with his biological father, Li, and joins his panda family in a secret, luscious valley beyond the mountains. He must train the pandas to help China defeat supernatural villain Kai, whose goal is to defeat all the Kung Fu masters and gain an unmatched superpower.The film has the action, tense and adventure of any martial arts-themed movie, though, I thought much of the humor in the movie was forced comedy and the reunion between Po and his long-lost father was rushed - missing that drama and emotion. Their ""catching-up"" time was rather goofy and boring, especially the part where they goof around with the treasures and figurines in the Jade Palace. There were some laugh-out-loud comedy, though, as the Mr. Ping and Mei-Mei characters were the best in exhibiting that. The villain was powerful and cold, but overall wasn't very menacing; he also tried too hard a times to be comedic.Mixed in the movie is a memorable cast of characters provided by an all-star voice cast by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, Lucy Liu, David Cross, James Hong, Bryan Cranston, J.K. Simmons and Kate Hudson. All did a good job in their respected performances, though unfortunately, there were hardly any dialog from the some of the Furious Five characters, especially Lucy Liu's Viper character.The movie's animation and visual effects capture the many beautiful characteristics of China including the wonderful Jade Palace and the luscious and brilliant panda valley. There were more comedic stuff than suspense, but the action scenes, especially the climatic battle, was pretty spectacular. Also, loved the ending version song of ""Kung Fu Fighting""! Overall, it's not as good as the first two Kung Fu Panda movies, but it's still nice entertainment for the entire family.Grade B-"
76,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,5 September 2016,"Po faces his worst, the most brutal, and the strongest enemy of all.","Kung Fu Panda 3 is the most excellent movie of the serial. Po has reached to Nirvana level in this movie. in my opinion from now on, no other enemies can be convincing. So this adventure should come to an end.Movie becomes boring from time to time, especially in the Panda village. But Kai, the enemy of the movie, is so strong and so intriguing that the audience wonder what will happen next. Kai has no mercy. This makes the movie sometimes scary instead of entertaining. Hope and despair follows each other continuously. With chi power movie levels up. For the first time we have doubts whether we can reach to an happy ending. But as always, goodness wins! :)"
77,Kung Fu Panda 3,3,4 September 2016,a tired sequel,"Horrible writing combines with a plot that a 5 year old could have written. No one in the cinema laughed once (except for a little kid whose baby brothers ice cream fell off the stick) and I'm pretty sure everyone over that age of 5 gave up on Dreamworks when he turned into a dragon without any explanation whatsoever. the whole idea of chi is extremely quickly brushed over and the best way they could have described it is ""whatever the plot needs it to be."". The only thing that stops this from being a 1 star review is Jack Black's enthusiasm and some kinda alright fight scenes. There are so many great kids movies you could watch don't waste your time with this tired sequel. now excuse me while i go hibernate until Shrek 5 comes out."
78,Kung Fu Panda 3,4,3 September 2016,Skidud!,"Saw this around Memorial Day this year. Being a fan of the first two films, I was hoping this one would be as good if not better. Wow! I couldn't have been more disappointed.Kung Fu Panda 3 is not awful but it certainly has some major flaws. The story line is rather simple and easy to follow but it lacks a major thing that the first two had, heart. This one just felt so forced with no love behind it. The jokes seemed forced and unnecessary. Some of them were even potty humor, something this franchise never really dived into with the other films.And what is with the panda colony? They all seem stupid and lazy. It is no wonder they forgot how to find their Chi. And the father even has the nerve to lie to Po about finding and knowing how to use it. Of course naturally they work things out and there's a happy ending.One of my biggest issues with KP3 is the villain Kai. First of all he isn't nearly as intimidating as Tai Lung, not to mention that it rhymes. Kai also doesn't have the eeriness of Shen from the second film.The one thing that really hurt my feelings in this movie was the mentally challenged panda. The fact that they made fun of someone for having bad teeth and a limited mental capacity really didn't sit well with me. DreamWorks really hit below the belt and actually had enough nerve to imply that being mentally challenged is a sin. The panda actually came with straightened teeth in the ending. Shame on you DreamWorks!In all it wasn't a major disappointment but not enough to hold my interest. I plan on adding the second film into my collection but this one will be off of my list."
79,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,18 August 2016,"Nothing special. Actually, nothing at all.","Many consider the worst second and third entries in a trilogy to be, respectively, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. To justify this sentiment, you'd only have to immerse yourself in the aforementioned films for all of five minutes, or if that doesn't prove sufficient, steel yourself and bump it up to ten. Or you can take my word for it and save yourself the trouble.But my personal sacred classic spoiled by awful follow-ups, forming the most uneven trilogy in existence, is Kung Fu Panda. Kung Fu Panda, an animated film about a talking panda who does kung fu (duh!) is one of my favourite films of all time, and with good reason. The animation snaps, the story crackles, and the themes pop. And if that isn't enough, it has really delicious looking bowls of noodle soup.Kung Fu Panda 2, in contrast, is the cinematic equivalent of prehistoric sludge. In the context of its predecessor, it shouldn't even exist (Po unlocks God mode in the first film). It's like making a sequel to Gandhi, or, for that matter, The Matrix. It doesn't make an ounce of goddam sense.The third thankfully appreciates Po's godliness, and works around it in a way that respects the ""lore"" (no other word comes to mind, I'm afraid) of Po. But, as a narrative, the film feels like a TV show: contained, toothless, and squeezed into a runtime that doesn't do the story justice. As with the first two, the animation is seamless, but it never reaches the same visual or emotional heights of the first film.The corruption of Po's character is most obvious. Po used to be concerned with semi-real things, but after an endless barrage of extended ""Aw-suuuum""s, one finds it hard to appreciate Po beyond anything more than a crazed fanboy. Po's endearing passion for kung fu ceases to become an asset, morphing instead into a unfunny and deeply dehumanizing disposition that removes depth from his character (which, sadly, was already there). What a troll.As far as villainy goes, Po's latest adversary falls flat. He's basically a big fat yak who jacks ""chi"" from everyone he meets and turns them into his slaves. Apart from the fact that he was kind of big, he didn't seem like a threat at all. His design is nice though, which is probably the only thing that KFP 3 does better than the first: they made a villain that has interesting garb, rather than floppy purple pants that look like they were made out of a Scrabble bag.The film does have its moments. Sometimes it feels like an old action film, like when Po trains alone to face his adversary while said adversary steadily approaches. Sometimes it's very well designed and executed. The prettiness never seems to overwhelm, either, which is nice. But this notwithstanding, most of Kung Fu Panda 3 is forgettable and inoffensive, the sort of bland summer entertainment that merits a single watch. Or perhaps, if you live a less lethargic life than I do, a viewing total of 0 would suffice."
80,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,17 August 2016,"Formulaic, but it's got heart to spare","Aside from a few new side characters, ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" doesn't offer up anything game-changing; nothing that diverts from proved success. And depending on what you're looking for, that can either be a positive or a negative. It's a positive for me.The story's another variant on the series' theme of self-discovery, and it's another 90 minutes of gorgeous animation and martial arts as superhero movie. But this is just such an ideal for Jack Black, and Po is such an endearing character. Compare this with other kids fare (to put it cynically), there aren't any hip references and the action's not halted for a pop song. That speaks volumes. And every of of these movies has just the right message for kids. All I'm really saying is I enjoyed myself, and I'll be there for the fourth movie.7/10"
81,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,13 August 2016,Warm-hearted Fun,"This is my favourite of the current three films. Po is as lovable as ever as he goes on a journey of self-discovery. He is excited to meet his real Dad and a whole Panda clan; but his devotion to his Goose Father and friends at home is never in doubt. The cutest moments belong to Tigress though. She gains a special devotee. While Po hopes to become a Chi Master in time to defeat a returning evil, The Five fight without him. They aren't in that many scenes though, compared to 1 & 2. This is a Panda Adventure. There is plenty of humour and a great deal of heart. The animation is beautiful. The ending is spectacular. There are strong messages about helping people to discover their strengths and that failure is a learning tool. Success comes from trying again and accepting support from others. The important thing is to be you."
82,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,19 July 2016,A fitting trilogy-capper,"It seems that whenever an animated film is a hit nowadays, a sequel is a given and the idea of a franchise gets the studio heads salivating. The quality tends to decline as the movies go on, with the exception of the Toy Story films, yet as long as the money piles up they'll just continue to churn them out - the increasingly unbearable Ice Age franchise being the worst offender. It was never in doubt that the hugely successful Kung Fu Panda (2008) would get a sequel, and when it came it was surprisingly good; a feast for the eyes backed by Gary Oldman's fantastic vocal performance and a serious undertone of genocide. It's taken 5 years for number 3 to finally arrive, so was a third instalment truly justified?Well yes and no, with a lot more emphasis on the yes. The series' strongest suit has always been the visuals, and the explosive, exciting action sequences here are some of the best in animation history. But the ideas running through the first two films were more or less 'stay true to yourself' and 'follow your dreams', and here it seems to be highlighting the importance of family, themes which are interchangeable and simplistic. So more of the same then, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Picking up the story not long after the events of Kung Fu Panda 2, Po (Jack Black) is still juggling his time between his adoptive father Mr. Ping (James Hong) and his noodle stand, and training with Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and the Furious Five.While Po is viewed as a hero and seems to be enjoying his celebrity status a bit too much, Shifu reminds him of his position as the Dragon Warrior, and feels it is time that the chubby panda takes on more responsibility by training his friends Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) in the art of kung fu. Meanwhile, ancient warrior Kai (J.K. Simmons) battles his former friend Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) in the Spirit Realm and steals enough of his chi to return to the Mortal Realm. Using the chi of defeated masters in the form of jade warrior soldiers, Kai hopes to seek out Po and defeat the famed Dragon Warrior. However, Po is somewhat distracted by the return of his actual father Li (Bryan Cranston), a jolly panda who hopes teach his son the delights of being a panda.Despite Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh's third instalment sharing a lot in common with the two that came before both thematically and story-wise - despite the introduction of the ingenious jade warriors and equipping Kai with a sense of humour, the film is again about Po tapping into unknown powers to defeat an evil baddie - it retains the series' effortless charm. Black is again on form as, well, Jack Black, and his distinctly American brand of humour at odds with the more straight-faced bad-asses surrounding him is one of the key aspects to these movies' success. But the real plaudits must go to the visual effects department, who have stepped up their game no end to create a truly wonderfully realised world. Dreamworks apparently have plans to make six Kung Fu Panda films, and although I'll certainly watch them if they're made, this trilogy-capper seems to be a fitting closure."
83,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,17 July 2016,Great film with great story,"I watch Kung Fu Banda from the first edition I really like it. the second edition wasn't that much good but still I love it. Now with the third edition it's really fantastic. I am extremely in love with this type of story, a personal hero which give me a very large push in my personal goal and dreams even if it's not real still I believe that the human can do lots and lots of thing so the film was brilliant I really love all the details and the massages in the story how it teach the people to believe in them self and just to focus in that because being your self open unexpected doors in the life and I like to watch more part for this awesome film."
84,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,15 July 2016,A January Movie that Doesn't Suck? Whaaaat??,"Continuing his ""legendary adventures of awesomeness"", Po must face two hugely epic, but different threats: one supernatural and the other a little closer to his home. Kung Fu Panda 3 was the film expected it to be which is awesome with 2 more additions Bryan Cranston and J.K Simmons as Li and Kai the film expands more the backstory of Po that the 2nd film did since his dad is still alive and he takes him back to his world where other Panda's live in the film also has a great enemy and for the most part the film is amazing although i wish they had a little bit more of gags in it that's it other than that this is a great Family movie that both kids and their parents will enjoy can't wait for Part 4."
85,Kung Fu Panda 3,5,28 June 2016,Fun film,Please note spoilersThis is my first Kung Fu Panda film I have watched fully and the first review of the Kung Fu Panda films so it will be short. (yes I know I should watch and review the other two first) This is a fun film (not so surprising really given it's the third film and it has long running cartoon series) As a kids film the mix of comedy for both adults and children is well balanced and not boring. The cast is a good and DreamWorks continues to move forward with its mix of animation styles. I did like the idea of jade zombies (or jombies) best twist on zombies for ages.As I said at the start this is first one I have watched fully and to be honest I was pleasantly surprised.
86,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,2 February 2016,"What it lacks in dramatic heft, it makes up for with visual splendor.","If I wasn't such a fan of the 'Kung Fu Panda' franchise, I would only give its third installment a 7/10. Anyone who has enjoyed the past films will feel right at home with this one.After being Dragon Warrior for quite some time now, Po learns that he must take the next step of his journey by becoming a teacher. However, he quickly gets sidetracked as both his biological father, Li, and a new supervillain, Kai, appear in his life. Now Po must find a way to not only become a teacher but also reconnect with his father and overcome his new foe.'KFP 3' offers much of the same in terms of story when compared to its predecessors. Although it is refreshing to see a shift in tone and pace (when compared to the much darker 'KFP 2'), the film itself doesn't feel as dramatic or fulfilling as it should be. There are, of course, darker moments in this film, but they end up blocking character development rather than adding to it.The villain in this film, Kai, is absolutely fantastic - the opening scene says it all (IMHO, the opening scene is worth the price of admission alone). J.K. Simmons was cast perfectly in the role. In addition to capturing the ferocity of his character, Simmons also gets his sarcastic attitude down to a tee.The technicals of this film (the voice-acting, the animation, the sound effects, the music) are outstanding. It's worth noting that 'Kung Fu Panda' is one DreamWorks Animation's crown jewels, so it only makes sense that the company would put their best foot forward for this film.Overall, 'KFP 3' offers a more lighthearted, action-packed adventure that has some truly shocking moments. I personally think that the film may have contained too many jokes, but I can't deny that I had some genuine bursts of laughter while watching it."
87,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,31 January 2016,My Favorite Dreamworks Franchise,"Even better than Shrek.It's amazing how every single iteration of Kung Fu Panda is somehow as good or better as the original. Rather than being a typical talking animal children's movie, Kung Fu Panda is sensitive and funny and smart all at the same time, and KFP3 is no exception. Besides from some questionable moments of slapstick humor (but whatever, it's a kids movie what else can you expect) this movie was great. I actually laughed aloud at some parts because this movie was Actually Funny. Based on the trailer, I was prepared to be disappointed, but I was surprised they didn't shoehorn a romance between Po and Mei Mei (the lady panda in the trailer), and they resolved the conflict between Po's goose dad and real dad in a very touching way. Also of course, there was a very satisfying and loud happy ending (my favorite part)."
88,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,4 March 2016,Really good fun,"I think that it was a very good sequel to the first and second and is good that Po finds his father and the panda village and I think it was very good and went into Po's story in more detail and explains how he met his father and who lives in the panda village it also shows different kung fu skills and is a very funny film,it is better than the first one because it had more methods of fighting and had henchman unlike the first one, the second film didn't have as much methods of fighting in and only focused on inner peace and Po understanding that he was adopted, however I think this one answers all the questions that were asked from the first and second films.Overall I think that the film was very good and had lots of elements of comedy in it and was full of kung fu action."
89,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,2 March 2016,This movie is really bad...(spoilers),"Let's begin with the bad guy, Kai. Talk about wasted potential and several plot holes. He was another ""Good guy turned evil"", but the writers got lazy there. Kai was Oogway's best friend. The dude even carried an injured Oogway for MILES until they found healers to treat Oogway and Kai's first thoughts when he saw that the panda healers had chi? To say ""I want powers now. I'm gonna become bad guy out of nowhere"", so he absorbed the chi of the pandas (never explained how since that was supposed his and Oogway's first time ever seeing chi). Then Oogway used chi to banish him into the spirit realm (again, another plot hole because Shifu said himself that Oogway took 30 years to master chi and this could only be done AFTER he met the pandas and Kai's banishment happened right after they met the pandas). The wasted potential was because they could have gone with the route of Oogway not being much of a saint and actually have betrayed Kai , but no. 180º turn on a character for no reason other than have a conflict for the movie. It wasn't even a subtle or decently written like it was for Tai Lung or Shen.The 2 dads things. That part both upset and comforted me a little. The goose (forgot his name) was Po's adoptive father and his final reaction to Po wanting to know his biological father better was quite well done. What was poorly done was Po's reaction to the whole thing. ""wow, I have a biological dad. I won't even talk about my biological mom and not even ask how I was lost in first place. because, you know, it might actually have been an accident or my biological parents might have been assholes when they were young.""Po knows about his mother from the 2nd movie, but Po's father didn't know that his son knew, so I still count it as a plot hole. They could have at least done a small scene where:Po's dad: ""Po...listen...I need to talk to you about...your mother. You deserve to know."" Po then raises a hand and places it over his shoulder and say: ""I already know...""The liar revealed trope. That...was actually well done. I too would lie to my son if it could save his life.The whole chi thing: the TV series is not canon after this movie because they had already tackled chi there and here they acted like it's a new thing. How the heck did a whole village of pandas ""forgot"" how to use chi? At first i thought that Kai must have killed them all and that Oogway only had the knowledge of what he had initially seen and decide to self teach for 30 years, but at the end there was a flashback of him training with the pandas (again, that plot hole from the beginning). Then, at the end, everyone, WHO JUST SAW A FEW PICTURES OF THE ***** MOVEMENTS TO USE CHI. repeated the moves and went full care bears with ""I care!!!!!!"" and gave Po power to defeat Kai. Stuff that several masters had trouble to learn was suddenly learned in a few seconds by everyone (not just pandas) in a few seconds because ONLY NOW they cared.Long story short, this movie had decent visuals and a few things done right in the story hence why I can't give it a lower rating."
90,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,3 February 2016,They forgot one important thing. Their own lesson.,"Warning: Big spoilers up ahead. Or down ahead. Whatever.So...Kung Fu Panda 3. I find myself torn on this film. The film was good, don't get me wrong. I had fun. But i also found myself rolling my eyes at other parts. But worst of all; The potential was massive. I saw so many great ideas being wasted in favor of some very boring comedy, and only touched upon. Lets divide the film in three categories;The good; The music is, like the earlier installments, amazing. Heartfelt, action packed, comedic. The fights scenes have had a massive upgrade. The fights are more diverse(Crane VS Kai, Mantis and Crane VS the rest of the five and Shifu, etc). Po's story is also taken to a new place, as he must learn to teach Kung Fu. He went from student, to master, to teacher. Mr. Ping is probably the films funniest character. The amount of chuckles i got from him was tremendous. He also gives one of the best emotional moments. And then there is Kai. Kai, my Kai, where have you been my whole life. He, along with Mr. Ping, is the films big selling point for me. When i saw this guy in the trailer, i was sold. His appearance, his size, J. K. Simmons voice! And he was cool. Beyond that, Oogway was fun, and so was the furious five, even more so than before. The bad: The panda village is an ensemble of OK at best and very annoying. A lot of the humor from the panda's are simply just annoying. You have a dumb hugger, an annoying kid and the rest are just kinda loud background characters. At one point they even ruin one of the films emotional moments. Sacrilege! Yeah, its a kids film, but kids can enjoy more mature/less low-brow humor.The wasted potential: Kai's glossed over back story. He had a close connection to Oogway, grew greedy, got banished. Boom, over. WHAT!? Thats it!? Come on! The relationship between Oogway and Kai needed exploration. Give Kai more reason, more sympathy. Had they given this to Kai, he could have been one of the greatest villains of all time! And it could have added more to Oogway! How must he have flt banishing his ""brother""? In the last movie, it killed Shen's parents. That was interesting.The spirit world. Look at it. Its beautiful, its gorgeous! So why on earth is the fight between Po and Kai in the spirit world so short and one sided!? It happens in the blink of an eye. All in all, the film is good. Good, not great or amazing, just good. But remember; ""If you only do what you can do, you'll never be more than you are"" -Shifu. The series have done good, but if they don't do more than what they can do, they'll never be more than good. Good is good, but great is better. And i know hey have the potential for great. In fact, if i have learned anything from the film, its about evolving your work, even if the film may not have. Take that quote into consideration. Listen to the cartoon animal ;)"
91,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,30 January 2016,"Has a lot of heart and great action, but the emphasis on humor takes away much of its potential","Kung Fu Panda 3 is a good animated film, but it isn't quite up to the standards of the past two films. While the animation is gorgeous and it has a lot of interesting premises, it also suffers from becoming too distracted with humour.Don't get me wrong, this movie is funny. There are a lot of really good humorous moments and almost all of the jokes work... unfortunately, a lot of the jokes happen during dramatic or emotional moments. This movie is the polar opposite of the second movie. While the second movie was dark and dramatic, this movie is light-hearted and funny.This could work... if this movie didn't have such high stakes.And that is a pretty big problem. The thing is that this movie has the highest stakes of all of the movies, but it has the least drama and the least amount of intense scenes. Tai Lung had some very intense and intimidating moments, Lord Shen was down right terrifying at other points, but Kai... is mostly a joke. Even Kai doesn't seem to take himself very seriously. Granted, Kai is still a very cool villain and his laidback nature works with just how powerful he is, but there still needs to be some moments where we realize he isn't a joke. The other main issue is that his motivation is never thoroughly explained. There are a lot of cool ideas that they could've used to explain Kai's reasoning to absorb chi, but it isn't ever explained. He just turned... bad.All in all, that is probably the film's biggest issue. It needed to be more intense, and it needed a little bit more time to breathe. This film moves at a very fast rate, and it needs more quiet moments that are relaxing. While it isn't action 24/7, there is still a lot going on in every scene.Now, is the action good? Yes, it is still very good. Maybe not as good as Kung Fu Panda 1 or 2, but still good. Most of the action in this movie is spectacle over complexity, but it works. Does this movie still have heart? Yes, the movie still has heart and some good emotional moments as well.So yeah, good movie, but the weakest of the three films."
92,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,25 March 2016,An exuberant and delightful sequel.,"I rate the original Kung Fu Panda so highly it comfortably makes my top five animated movies of all time. Yes, of all time. And the second one, widely disregarded by most critics, is not that far behind it in my eyes. Well this trilogy-closer proves the law of diminishing returns to be true by continuing the slight downward trend of the series, yet it still kicks, punches and rib tickles its way to being an entertaining experience for all ages. Screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger unleash everything including the comedic kitchen sink in an attempt to garner laughs, littering this follow-up with inventive visual gags, hilarious dialogue (often helped by Jack Black's endearing delivery) and cheeky in-house references. The comedy doesn't always land without a hitch but it is of a high enough standard that the few damp squibs float by without much notice, and they've also struck a nice balance between obvious jokes for the kiddies and subtler quips for the adults. Where there's a noticeable dip in quality, however, is with the martial arts sequences; the fights lacking the ingenuity and complexity of the previous volumes, despite being passionately directed and beautifully realised. A venture into the spiritual realm allows the gorgeous animation to thrive even more than normal, though it's a shame the cut-and-paste narrative didn't get the same level of attention from those operating behind the scenes. This is undoubtedly Black's show and his voice work as the bumbling Po is outstanding yet again. Elsewhere in the gigantic ensemble cast, newcomer Kate Hudson makes the biggest impression with her hysterical delivery as the confident ribbon-dancing Panda, Mei Mei. Although it may have lost the spark of brilliance existing in the first instalment, KFP3 is nevertheless an exuberant and delightful adventure."
93,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,7 March 2016,Kung Fu Panda 3 has pulled its weight fairly well.,"Remember when this franchise took a left turn down a serious and emotional alley in the second film? Well, DreamWorks certainly didn't turn around on this one. The character of Li Shan, Po's father, is a central presence, and might possibly be the most sympathetic character in all of Kung Fu Panda. From what we saw in the second film, he was a loving father and husband who was fiercely protective of his family when threatened, and he is re-introduced as a gentle soul who wants only to be with his son. But like any of us, he isn't perfect, as well-intentioned as he may be. Which is why I'm also glad Mr. Ping got a bigger role in this film, as he is a perfect foil to Li Shan. There are some very heartfelt moments between them and Po that brings depth to the family dynamic, and it's all the better to see that the Dragon Warrior loves both his dads very much.I would have liked to see the Furious Five play a more important part in this movie; although we've pretty much seen all there is to see about their abilities in the previous two films, I couldn't help but feel that the writers were a little too eager to move them out of the way in favor of the new characters. But I do think having Tigress as the lone ""survivor"" to help Po was a nice touch, as we glimpsed the strength of their friendship in the second movie, but this film certainly brought it out in full.While Kai may be something of a run-of-the-mill villain, there's no denying that he's gorgeously animated, perhaps on par with the showy and elegant Lord Shen from Kung Fu Panda 2. Still, the ""frustrated famous character who no one remembers as famous"" joke (or as I like to call it, ""Star-Lord syndrome"") feels like a retread from countless other movies. But it is a movie for kids, so I can't really hold that against DreamWorks.Some of these shortcomings would be detrimental to most movies, but nonetheless I think Kung Fu Panda 3 has pulled its weight fairly well (pun intended?). The majority of the film has been otherwise interesting, visually appealing, downright emotional at times, and of course funny. While it's hard to measure up to the bar that was set by the previous movie's tear-jerking third act, Kung Fu Panda 3 concludes the trilogy (unless the studio REALLY wants to make three more) on a satisfying note.Source: http://www.kungfupanda3film.com/"
94,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,2 March 2016,Fun Sequel for all to watch,"The First Kung Fu Panda was a great little film, that spawned couple of sequels and TV shows. This is the second official cinema release sequel to that film, and it starts of exactly the same way as the its predecessors with Po imaging great battles and playing with his action figures. The story in this third installment is arguable the weakest one, even can go and say that it contradicts the entire second film. Kung Fu Panda 3 revolves around Po learning how to be a panda again. It is full of his typical jokes and misunderstandings and his clumsiness. However the film does lack an interesting villain and a strong story.Acting in the film is all animated,but the voice over acting is done extremely well. I am pleased to say that Jackie Chan has some of the funniest dialogue in the entire film, and he only has a handful of lines. Jack Black is almost now the voice you think of when thinking what would panda sound if they could talk. While Dustin Hoffman is always brilliant.Story wise i feel that it was a bit of a let down. We found out there is another prophesy and there is another evil pupil and master that wants to rule the entire world and Po is Chosen to save him. Panda race is made out to be almost like the superior race to all other animals. Seriously not a single Panda got injured or hurt and all of them became masters of Kung Fu within a matter of days or hours. You would think if thats how easy for Panda's to become so good, how were they ever under a threat of anybody? Why would they need to hide themselves if they have all of this chi inside of them? Overall this is still a fun animated movie to watch that will provide you with more then a few laughs if you don't take it to seriously."
95,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,1 March 2016,This film is amazing film with great story.,"I watch Kung Fu Banda from the first edition I really like it. the second edition wasn't that much good but still I love it. Now with the third edition it's really fantastic. I am extremely in love with this type of story, a personal hero which give me a very large push in my personal goal and dreams even if it's not real still I believe that the human can do lots and lots of thing so the film was brilliant I really love all the details and the massages in the story how it teach the people to believe in them self and just to focus in that because being your self open unexpected doors in the life and I like to watch more part for this awesome film."
96,Kung Fu Panda 3,5,6 September 2016,Some funny moments but the first movie was better! 5/10,"Review: After the great first movie in this franchise, I wasn't that impressed with the second movie but this movie was slightly better. It still lacked the humour and originality of the first film and I did find Po (Jack Black) quite annoying in parts but it's still a watchable movie, especially if you watch it with kids. I liked the relationship between Po and his father and the showdown at the end was half decent but the animation wasn't in the same league as Pixar, and after 3 movies, Po still isn't taking his ""Kung Fu Master"" skills that seriously. The different Pandas brought a new flavour to the film, and I did find the little ones cute but the whole franchise seems to have hit a dead end. The main problem that I found with the film is that Po is still saying and doing silly things, whilst mastering an art form which can save the village, against the evil bull looking character, Kai (J.K.Simmons), so it was a bit of a weird mixture. The whole Chi concept wasn't bad but I was just hoping for more laughter throughout the film. Average!Round-Up: I know that this film was aimed at a younger age, so I can't put it down too much, and I'm sure that it is much more enjoyable in a family environment but from an adults point of view, it didn't really do it for me. This is the first film directed by Alessandro Carloni but the other director, Jennifer Yuh Nelson directed the second movie in this franchise, so she was familiar with the characters. If they decide to make another movie, they really need to bring back the same humour that they had in the first movie, and it would be good to see the characters progress in the world of Kung Fu, now that Po knows the power of the Chi.Budget: $145million Worldwide Gross: $520millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/action/adventures, with voices by Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, J.K. Simmons, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, David Cross, Kate Hudson, James Hong and Jean- Claude Van Damme. 5/10"
97,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,16 February 2016,"The Worst of the Trilogy, but Still Plenty of Fun","I was super excited to see this movie. Of all the upcoming 2016 movies, this was at the top of my list of to-watch movies. Having loved the first two, I wanted to make sure that I caught this one in theaters. While it's not phenomenal, nor is it as good as the others, it's still a very fun watch. Kung Fu Panda 3's plot is similar to the other two: A new bad guy emerges and the Furious Five and Dragon Warrior must stop him. Unfortunately, this movie is very much the same as the last two. The opening segment is similar to that of the second, and the sequence of events is relatively similar to the other two as well. Its a formula that works, and in this case, doesn't stand out enough to take away from the movie. Nevertheless, it's not like we've never seen this before. The characters are, as usual, pretty good. Po is the same lovable kung fu panda that we all know and love, but this doesn't always work. We've seen him goof around for the last two movies, and in terms of the humor related to his character, there isn't anything new. The other characters were never overused in the previous movies, so they weren't stale yet. Mantis was a little annoying this time around though, and it wasn't in a good way. The main antagonist, Kai, was pretty great, as the villains always are.The artistic design of this movie is very good. All the visuals are stunning to look at, even more so than the first two, and it really stands out. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the ending. I think that if it'd been handled a bit more seriously it would've worked better and been less out of place. Overall Kung Fu Panda 3 is, while the worst of the trilogy, still a lot of fun. The plot isn't overly unique, but it still worked, the characters were good, and the visuals were amazing. In the end I'd recommend this movie to fans of the first two, but don't expect it to be the best of the series."
98,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,31 January 2016,My Review,"I have a tendency to generalize more than I should, but my comment was directed toward the author's use of the word ""escapism"" in the headline for this article. ""Escapism"" suggests that children have a stressful or ""unpleasant reality"" from which they need to ""escape,"" or forget for a while in order to achieve relaxation or peace.While some children do have very harsh realities, I feel as though the author's generalization is far more condemning than mine; this is ""entertainment"" for children  hell, even ""educational"" if parents do their jobs and talk about what happened, why it happened, and what they could learn from it. To call it ""escapism"" is enabling those who think our poor, poor children have such difficult lives that they need to watch a Panda practice Kong fu for two hours to make it through their stressful days.Kids will never learn to cope with life's struggles or disappointments if we raise them thinking of ""entertainment"" as ""escapism."" So many studies are being published these days showing how unprepared incoming freshmen are for college, and how more children are medicated now than ever before. I think the thought process represented by this word choice contributes to that issue in a huge way, even though it seems like insignificant semantics."
99,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,12 February 2016,Good but not good enough,"The film doesn't fail to meet the standard of a hilarious animation. The action was as good as the previous two of the series. The feature is better. And music fits the Chinese culture very well.So what is dissatisfying? It is the story. It goes smoothly until the last fight. Simply it is too sloppy at describing how Po gets to know the mystic ""Chi"". It all comes in a flip. And things just go overwhelming as usual. Before this point, it could not be better. So I category the movie as one of those have a very good start but doesn't end up as good as the starting. If there is another one, I do hope the screenplay (story part) could be more logical and sensible."
100,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,31 January 2016,"See ""Kung Fu Panda 3"". The chi is strong with this one.","A good film franchise shows the audience something new with each successive film, but also respects, relates to and builds upon its predecessors. By that definition, the ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies make up a very good film franchise  with the critical and audience ratings, and box office numbers, to back up that assessment. Each of these movies is designed to stand alone (and does), but before reviewing ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" (PG, 1:35), it seems like a good idea to take a look back at how these films got us here.The ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies are an animated series of films which focus on Po (voiced by Jack Black), a clumsy, but earnest rotund talking giant panda who uses his ever-growing kung fu skills to protect the residents of a fictional place in China called The Valley of Peace. In this effort, Po leads other anthropomorphic animals called ""The Fantastic Five""  Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross)  all of who are also kung fu masters. They all study under Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). In the original ""Kung Fu Panda"" (2008), Po realized his dream of becoming a kung fu master and received the title ""Dragon Warrior"" from Grand Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim)  but still had to win the respect of The Fantastic Five and Master Shifu. In ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" (2011), Po further proved his value in leading the effort to defend the Valley of Peace by thwarting a villain who intended to use the newly invented cannon to conquer all of China. Also during the second film, Po, who was adopted and raised by a goose named Mr. Ping (James Hong), is driven to distraction when clues about his past drive him to want to find out about his birth parents.In ""Kung Fu Panda 3"", Po faces challenges which make those he faced in the first two films pale in comparison. Master Shifu announces his retirement from teaching kung fu and places Po in charge of the continuing training of The Fantastic Five. It doesn't go well, and Po has a crisis of confidence that develops into a full-blown existential crisis when he suddenly meets Li Shan (Bryan Cranston), another giant panda who Po believes is his biological father. Li Shan takes Po to a secret panda village where Po is very happy to see other giant pandas for the first time since he was an infant. Li Shan teaches Po the panda ways and promises to teach him the power of chi, the potentially powerful life force that exists in all living things. It's a power Po will need to harness to realize his full potential as The Dragon Warrior.Meanwhile, a yak-like beast called Kai (J.K. Simmons) has escaped the spirit world, where Grand Master Oogway had exiled him 500 years earlier for attempting to use the power of chi for selfish reasons. This blade-wielding spirit warrior has stolen the chi of the kung fu masters in the spirit realm and now he's out to take the chi of every master in the land of the living. When Kai gets someone's chi (basically, their essence) he/she becomes confined in jade charms that Kai wears around his neck and that he releases in the form of jade zombies who do his bidding and make-up his own personal army. That's one nasty yak.""Kung Fu Panda 3"" contains elements from a wide variety of other movies to include ""Frozen"" (Elsa leaving Arendelle) and, believe it or not, ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" (Dr. Evil stealing Austin's ""mojo""), but the most apt comparison is probably the original three ""Star Wars"" films (Episodes IV, V and VI). You can think of Po as Luke, Master Shifu as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Grand Master Oogway as Yoda, Kai as Darth Vader and ""chi"" as ""the force"". Imperfect comparisons, maybe, but it kinda works.Outside influences or not, one of the many strengths of this film is its story. Rather than making a sappy movie about Po's search for his biological father, this script deals with his daddy issues in a way that's integral to a more significant and more interesting story of Po discovering who he is as a person er, panda  and the battle against the otherworldly Kai. Unfortunately, even though it's an animated film meant mainly for kids, the movie is a little too silly for its own good at the beginning  before it gets interesting  and then gets unnecessarily silly at moments when something important is happening. But those criticisms only reflect a few isolated moments in the film. Most of this film is appropriately silly.This movie is good fun that both kids and adults can enjoy. The voice acting is excellent, the animation is solid and the artwork within the animation is particularly appealing. This franchise has given us consistently high-quality. Here's hoping that continues if DreamWorks goes forward with up to three future installments. Based on ""Kung Fu Panda 3"", I think they will. The chi is strong with this one. ""B+"""
101,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,31 January 2016,Skadoosh,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is a movie directed Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh and is written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger. It stars Jack Back, Bryan Cranston, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and J.K. Simmons.Continuing his ""legendary adventures of awesomeness"", Po must face two hugely epic, but different threats: one supernatural and the other a little closer to his home.When it comes to the Kung Fu Panda films, I have grown to expect quite a few things. Two of these things being: entertainingly subversive twists on the average martial arts fair and hilarious slapstick. Though the first Kung Fu Panda delivered these things in spades, the far superior, at least in my opinion, sequel built upon these successful attributes to deliver a truly compelling and very mature, character driven take on the, now iconic, panda. Although Kung Fu Panda 3 does loose a lot of its earned momentum and dramatic heft, it maintains the high entertainment value and heart of the original.With that said, quite a few things from the first sequel do carry over. The largest of these being the splendid visuals. The animation in this movie can only be described as pristine. The phenomenal mix of the yellow and green hues really emphasize character traits and subtlety hint at their morality. This precise decision is complimented by the wast and highly detailed backgrounds, which manages successfully engross audiences into the plot. The vocal performances by its all-star also succeed in transfixing audience members in a the third movie in a series about a dumpling eating, butt kicking panda. What a Feat! Aside from the reliably marvelous performances from Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, James Hong and Angelina Jolie, J.K. Simmons really manages to stand out as yet another fantastic villain in film series known for their awesome villains. He is also accompanied by a wonderful theme that slightly reminds me of the Imagine Dragons song, ""I'm so Sorry,"" which in the end worked as a positive.Though I do believe there is more to love than hate in this movie, I can't ignore the fact that this movie is flawed. My largest complaint stems from the lack of focus demonstrated. Perennially swinging back and forth and back and forth, much like a baby's cradle, this movie progressively felt like a string of one note, recycled jokes placed together haphazardly. The lack of dramatic heft did no favors as I wasn't as attached to the characters as I should've been. With that said, the lack of drama and abundance of jokes made sure that every single second was entertaining. It also made it easier to subvert genre cliché's like ""the hero's sacrifice.""In the end Kung Fu Panda 3 is a visually stunning, well acted, humorously written even if its a bit too light. Kung Fu Panda 3 gets a B+ or a 7/10."
102,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,17 February 2016,I enjoyed the film; about as much as the last installment.,"'KUNG FU PANDA 3': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Hit sequel, to the popular 2008 animated action-comedy flick 'KUNG FU PANDA'; and it's 2011 followup ('KUNG FU PANDA 2'). Jack Black (once again) returns to voice Po; an incompetent panda, that amazingly learns to master Kung Fu. This time, he reunites with his biological father; and takes on a powerful, supernatural enemy. The movie was directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson (who also helmed the last installment), and first time feature filmmaker Alessandro Carloni (who also served as a story artist, on the first two movies). It was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger; who also co-wrote the first two films. It costars the voice talents of Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, David Cross and James Hong (all reprising their roles from earlier movies); and newcomers Bryan Cranston, J.K. Simmons and Kate Hudson join the cast. I enjoyed the film; about as much as the last installment, but not as much as the original blockbuster.Po (Black) unexpectedly runs into another panda, named Li Shan (Cranston); at the noodle shop, owned by his adopted father, Mr. Ping (Hong). Po soon learns that Li is his biological father; and he decides to travel with him, to a secret village where the rest of his panda family lives. At the same time, an evil spirit warrior, named Kai (Simmons), attacks the Valley of Peace; using an army of possessed, ancient Kung Fu warriors. Po must then train his new family, to stop Kai. I think the original 'KUNG FU PANDA' was a pretty clever, and well made family film (for it's time). It's funny, and it's also mildly exciting (it's also a nice homage to Kung Fu movies, as well). The first sequel was OK, but I've forgotten nearly everything about it. This new installment was a lot of fun (while I was watching it), but I doubt I'll remember it; a couple years from now, either. That's not to say it's not entertaining, well made, and fun for kids (though). It's all of those things.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/3D- Xa6uhK5U"
103,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,3 February 2016,Kung Fu Panda 3 is another enjoyable outing from DreamWorks Animation,"I hadn't seen the previous Kung Fu Panda movies for a while so watching this helped me get a little reacquainted with the story and characters. In this one Po's actual dad comes back. Things seem to go well for them but, as one would expect, there's some trouble ahead...There were both touching and funny moments throughout and it was quite fun seeing it all put together. Po's identity goes into play here and when we learn some of his family story, it's quite something to be inspired by. Kudos to DreamWorks Animation for the work they did and do in many of their films. And, as always, I like to recognize many of the famous voices that got involved. So on that note, I recommend Kung Fu Panda 3."
104,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,2 February 2016,A Great Movie to Take Kids to That Adults Wont Hate,"The new installment to the Kung Fu Panda franchise, which might be the last we see of our fury friend, thus capping off the trilogy. While Kung Fu Panda 3 is certainly enjoyable and kids will like it, there are certain elements it didn't take away from the previous movie, and one of its main struggles is this one seemed more like a kids movie than the other previous two, as the first two had certain elements that made it more enjoyable for adults. The message in this movie is pretty good for kids, but the way they go about displaying isn't as good as the first two. I am a huge fan of Kung Fu Panda 2(and Dreamworks in general), and what works well in that movie is the darker tone it takes, as well as the message that we have to accept our dark pasts. Anyway back to KP3, the voice acting is superb, the action is actually really great at times, and while it does seem to run the series full circle it isn't better than its predecessors. Again great movie to take your kid to for a fun time, especially for an animated movie in January(I'm looking at you Norm of the North)"
105,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,23 May 2016,"Not as good as the previous two films, still very colourful and entertaining","The first 'Kung Fu Panda' film is a solid film, colourful and fun with thrilling action and engaging characters. The second film is even better, darker and more emotional while never forgetting to be entertaining, with the best villain in the series.'Kung Fu Panda 3' is not as good as the previous two films but there is plenty to make it well worth watching. It does contain three big flaws. As funny as the film is and how often hilarious the gags and dialogue are, 'Kung Fu Panda 3' does go overboard with the silliness and it does feel like it takes over everything else. Even in moments that are meant to be tense, like the confrontation between Po and Kai, they don't quite have the impact due to the humour getting in the way and it does jar.The film's villain Kai is the least interesting and least developed of the 'Kung Fu Panda' franchise, a huge disappointment after the previous film did such a wonderful job with Shen, one of those villains where you can understand why he's a threat but also to some extent understand his point of view. Kai certainly had potential. His first appearance was cool, suspenseful and wonderfully animated, the music in this scene fitted perfectly with the scene and a contender for the highlight of the soundtrack and JK Simmons clearly has a ball, booms ominously and demonstrates that he was born to play villains. However Kai compared to the previous two villains is rather one-dimensional, the Oogway conflict is forced and not enough is done with it and his motivations are not interesting or clear enough (not to mention clichéd).Lastly, the secondary characters and Po's friends are rather sidelined at the expense of the relationship between Po and his father, which admittedly is very nicely done, with their personalities somewhat bland. Tigress is the least wasted, showing some personality, but Shifu and Viper are especially wronged and criminally underused.However, the animation is really superb and some of the best and most inventive of the franchise. It is so vibrantly coloured, the backgrounds are fluid and very meticulously detailed, the editing has much finesse and the characters are well designed and modelled. The jombies, the nickname of the jade zombies, are splendidly realised in animation and personality. The soundtrack is incredibly dynamic, but also provides some tension and emotional depth, Kai's first entrance music is my personal favourite.Dialogue is zany and hilarious, loved the rapport between Po and his father, and the gags are cleverly animated and mostly are incredibly funny, apart from a few going on for too long and a bit too silly. The action is thrilling and filled with so much energy and the repartee is sharp. The story is admittedly predictable, but is efficiently paced, a lot of fun and provides plenty of thrills and emotional depth (the latter especially applies to the relationship between Po and his father). The life-lessons are well incorporated and never feel shoe-forced, I just wish that the humour despite being very entertaining was toned down. Loved the homage to 'Seven Samurai' too.While the characters and their developments are among the weakest assets of the film, they do engage enough. Po is still likable and Li Shan is a welcome addition. Mei Mei avoids being too annoying while not necessarily adding to the plot. The voice acting is terrific, Po has always been one of Jack Black's most tolerable and likable roles and he still delivers, Bryan Cranston shies away from his usual persona and entertains hugely and as aforementioned JK Simmons really impresses as Kai. The others, with Angelina Jolie being the standout, are solid though their material could have been much better.Overall, while the weakest of the 'Kung Fu Panda' films, 'Kung Fu Panda 3' is good solid fun, the 'Kung Fu Panda' films being one of those rare film franchises where all the films so far are good. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
106,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,29 April 2016,Brilliant!!!!!,"This has got to be alongside how to train your dragon, one of the best dreamworks animation films of recent years! It will make the whole family laugh. Jack black is amazing (yet again) as the slightly goofy kick ass panda known as Po. One of the strengths of the Kung fu Panda series is that all of the characters are well performed. My favourite has always been James Hong who plays Po's adopted father.The film is fast paced, action packed and full of humour. The story involves Po finding his real father, going back to his panda roots, and ultimately defeating the evil Kung fu master who is stealing everyone's inner peace. One of the reasons I love these films so much is that apart from being funny, the films build on each of the characters and the relationships between them. In the third installment, you can't help but feel sorry for Po's step dad who is a duck when his real father returns. I cannot wait for instalment number 4!"
107,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,22 March 2016,A decent way to end a very entertaining trilogy,"Visually, the art was beautifully done, the best plus in this movie. The artists really focus on the details, even the background. However, they still use the same style and no breakthrough. A shame 9/10 The audio was good, background music is awesome. Voice actors also nailed their roles, especially Bryan Cranston, J.K.Simmons and Jack Black, they were able to make the characters as if they are alive. Making the character development the more deep 8.5/10 The plot was so bad though, it's basically the same as the 1st one but with hundreds more of plot holes. They were good enough to squeezed in comic relief in intense scenes which is both good and bad because it gets annoying after a while. 5/10 Overall : 7.8/10"
108,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,16 March 2016,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is the weakest of the trilogy, yet a great movie","I am personally a Kung Fu Panda fan mainly because of its comedy and its story. I find both the first KFP and KFP 2 the best. With a third installment released, I was expecting a darker story and a really threatening villain just like in KFP 2. When I first heard that J.K Simmons will voice the villain, I had high expectations, given that he portrays his roles very well. However, not all my expectations were met, but this was still a great movie.First, let's talk about the story. I'll be honest, it's not as dark as Kung Fu Panda 2. This, however, had so much going on. A spirit villain coming to take the pandas' chi, Po learns that there is a secret panda village and he isn't the last panda after all, and taking the next step to being a dragon warrior. They could've just sticked to one story rather than lots in one.In my opinion, when Po found his father, it could've been more emotional. It was funny, but making it a tear-jerker scene would've been better. Also, I believe the story should have Po having a conflict in pleasing his panda father and adoptive father. I'm also wondering, what happened to this whole ""TiPo"" thing? Is it still there, or is it gone? Does Po and Tigress have a different relationship now? It's barely seen throughout the movie.The villain, Kai, wasn't as threatening nor scary as Tai Lung and Lord Shen (whom, in fact, I find the best villain of the KFP trilogy). I do like the idea that he can take pandas' chi, but in order to make a more meaningful, Kai should have done something excruciating to Po's panda father like being the murderer of Po's mother (although Lord Shen has already done that). The voice wasn't so sinister at all. I was expecting something just like J.J Jameson, Fletcher, and even Mayor Lionheart from Disney's Zootopia, but more sinister. I do find the voice ""okay"" though. Jack Black still enjoys lending his voice as Po and Bryan Cranston as his real father really enjoys voicing his character. Animating was still beautiful, mostly the Spirit Realm.This is the weakest in the trilogy. But while it's not better than its predecessors, it's still a great movie. I'm just hoping that Kung Fu Panda 4 will be as dark as KFP 2 and will improve over this. 8/10"
109,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,11 March 2016,best out of the 3,"Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016) of course is the 3rd portion of these films though quite possibly the better of the three. I really didn't have much interest in Kung Fu Panda 3 as films like this are typically the same ole thing over and over with just different images to see showing the same ole stories. Now that being said of course the story has been used millions of times with different scenery though this is a good movie. Kung Fu Panda 3, I believe is the best out of all 3 of the series; it was more family oriented and the comedy was so much better.Kung Fu Panda 3 brings to the table an all star cast, a great story; and a large variety of visual stylings used in a perfect way. I enjoyed the different uses of style though a few times you can tell that the shots were done with toys; but they still done a good job. If you liked any of the before films in this series then this one will not let you down."
110,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,10 March 2016,"Impressive visual, light humor and delightful character, ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a weighty fun for all.","Nowadays movies incorporate 3D for simple gimmick and they are not often used to create a unique style of their own like ""Kung Fu Panda 3"". It's a mix between cool motion, nice setting and intricate painting-like visual which dance smoothly on the big screen. The story is pretty straightforward with the usual panda shenanigans, but it holds up nicely and surprisingly has both good villain and family value.As Po becomes the Dragon Warrior he must face another foe from spirit realm as he tries to find his identity. It's a fine set-up with decent platonic premise, which also gives more spotlight to his silly step-father. It also presents a quite menacing antagonist, as menacing as the rating allows, in Kai (J.K Simmons) who is looking like a video game character and brings legitimate threat like in old martial art movie.The humor is maintained pretty well, there are parts that seem rushed and faster than it could've been, although this is the pace Kung Fu Pandas appears to be comfortable at. A few of the jokes are a bit repetitive, but most of them are enjoyable. Any franchise that reaches the third installment must have a relatively large cast, and the movie offers a good collection of supporting characters, it'd be nice to see more of them.Its best feature is the visual, I daresay Pixar and Disney have competition from Dreamworks by the style alone. Its presentation is utterly gorgeous, the oriental vibe is thick and the addition of mimicking stroke of brush is admirable since it creates distinct feel for each scene and character. Furthermore, it creates a great movements for the action, delivered by animal personas no less. To top it off, it's one of better looking movies in 3D.""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is adequately traditional in narrative and incredibly delightful for the eye."
111,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,30 January 2016,Beautiful but Narratively Stuck in Suspended Animation,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is the third in a franchise that is said to ultimately comprise of six films. In the first one, our protagonist Po (Black) realizes his potential as the Dragon Warrior. In the second, Po comes to understand his mysterious past and finds inner peace. In this movie, Po comes to understand what Chi is and teaches kung fu to a village of pandas seemingly in one afternoon. What is Po going to do next; become the hero of colonial China?The principle villain in Kung Fu Panda 3 is a spirit warrior by the name of Kai (Simmons). Formerly a friend to Master Oogway (Duk Kim), longtime deceased master of the Jade Palace, Kai steals Oogway's Chi to gain access to the mortal realm and seeks to remove Oogway's name from the history books. Standing in his way are Oogway's former pupils Master Monkey (Chan), Viper (Liu), Crane (Cross), Mantis (Rogen), Tigress (Jolie), Shifu (Hoffman) and Po. Meanwhile Po is visited by his presumed dead biological father Li (Cranston) who insists despite murmurs in the village, that Po come home to the panda village so he can learn to harness Chi which apparently only pandas can do. Shifu the current master of the Jade Palace agrees and delays his retirement partially because the prophecy reveals only a master of Chi can destroy Kai. Also Shifu recently let Po teach a kung fu class to the masters with disastrous results.The animation is breathtakingly beautiful in this film. The Village of Peace looks as vibrant as it ever did while new images of the panda refuge instantly brings to mind Zhangjiajie National Forrest in all it's glory. What's more, the fight scenes between masters takes advantage of each animal's unique attributes whether they be a mantis, a panda or a porcupine. Throughout the film Kai steals the Chi from different kung fu masters turning them into jade zombies (jombies); the detail work on the jade is an especially impressive as animators had to make it look smooth, hard, pristine yet slightly see-through.I only wish they worked a little harder on the story which is where the movie takes a fumble. It's not for lack of trying, there is certainly a lot of material. The concept of Chi was never fully explained and remains a nebulous idea throughout the movie. How does this life force work? How can Kai harness it? Why are pandas especially adept to learning how to harness Chi? The fact that Chi isn't even alluded to in previous movies, makes the entire concept (which has a deeply respected history in China) seem like a cheap add-on.Then comes the largest problem about this entire franchise which, if left unaddressed, will lead to its downfall in further installments. Let's talk about the panda in the room; Po, who just can't seem to grow up. The first movie was a perfect self-contained fable about realizing your own potential. Po was a geeky layabout who faced down a ferocious villain. The second movie, he's still a geeky layabout, only this time he comes face to face with a technological wonder (gunpowder) and defeats a villain that caused mass genocide. You'd think that kind of experience would ground someone yet in the beginning of Kung Fu Panda 3 there's Po, playing with action figures in a bubble bath. The difficulties Po faces in the first act runs contrary to the lesson he learned in Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011), and the principal lesson in this installment ""be the best you, you can be,"" feels like an echo to the first movie. There's no new ground broken here, not for the characters, not for the story, not for China.I sincerely hope the next few movies in the franchise learn a lesson from another Dreamworks tent-pole How to Train Your Dragon (2010). How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014) upped the stakes, changed the formula and matured the characters. Hiccup and Toothless are a duo that I feel have learned from one another and will continue to break new ground in other movies. I fear that as audiences get older and nothing new is learned, Po, Tigress and the rest of the gang will be left behind."
112,Kung Fu Panda 3,,12 February 2016,soul-mate-compatibility-by-name,"There's some good news about Kung Fu Panda 3, and there's some bad news. The good news is that it's genuinely funny at times and the animation is stunning(perhaps as good as we've seen from Dreamworks) and the movie works well enough to be enjoyable. The bad news is, it could have been much more. When Po meets his biological dad for the first time, it should have been an emotional, touching moment; instead it was played for laughs. And instead of making the villain Kai a threat to respect, they just made him goofy. Plus, the ""Furious Five"" get barely any screen time and the new characters are hardly worth mentioning. Also, the main idea of this movie being about ""who am I"", is practically a rehash of the first two movies. Yet with all its faults, the movie is still enjoyable if you take it for what it is, a funny, but cheesy third movie in the Kung Fu Panda trilogy.http://www.fightofdestiny.com/soul-mate-compatibility-by-name/"
113,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,5 March 2017,Not bad at all,"I've seen the first two movie, that we're very good, maybe better then this. But i enjoy this too. The same comedic Jack Black, with the help of the other character converge to a good final. I liked the fact that there are many famous actors who played the roles very well and bring a welcome doze of comedy. Recommend it!"
114,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,3 March 2017,Good Fun Movie to Watch,"It is really hard to make good sequels after a famous first movie. Because there is less room for character development, villain seems predictable, and fun factor is usually less. I did not enjoy Kung Fu Panda 2 a lot and I feared that the movie will face a similar fate. But I have to inform that the movie is a good one, if not the best.I felt the story development was hurried, and the movie ended too quickly. I can also feel that prime target of this movie was kids who will not think a lot about some improbable emotional aspects which can be seen in the movie. You cannot take this movie too seriously.There were funny dialogues, also there were nice quotations like ""Sometimes we do wrong things for right reasons"". There were many instances in the movie when you would laugh. It is a nice film. Just do not think too deeply about the plot of the movie, as many things might not make too much sense to a mature mind. Hopefully, we will be exploring the Kung Fu Panda's world more in coming future."
115,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,27 February 2017,Naive and whimsical Po is still going strong,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is about what you would expect. A roller coaster ride of gags, goof ups and outrageous martial art outbursts.Po is himself, clumsy, naïve, martial arts master and funny. As usual he is accompanied by his friends from the previous movies including the somewhat reluctant Shifu. The wise turtle Oogway from the first Kung Fu Panda is back as well, kind of.Naturally there is a big bad villain, General Kai, who it turns out have some past relations to Oogway. General Kai is pretty good as a villain with a suitable maniacal expression on his face. Then of course, a bull in itself is already projecting bad temper and violence so it is a good start.The main story is of course about defeating General Kai but Po's reunification with his (real) father and the rest of the, funny and very clumsy, inhabitants in the Panda village is taking up a large part of the movie.In general the story is quite nice with some nice twists.It should come as no surprise that Po, as usual, saves the day in a cataclysmic showdown with General Kai. There are some great animation effects in the final battle.At the end of the day this is a quite recommendable family movie."
116,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,15 February 2017,Kung Fu Panda 3 is a really good movie and a good ending of the franchise,"I'm a lover of the Kung Fu Panda movies since i was 8 years old. The first one is a really great movie. In that moment, i couldn't see the movie in theaters because my parents were busy in that moment, so i saw on DVD. The second one I achieved see in the theater in 3D with my family and it was amazing. The best of the franchise. And when i heard about the third one and saw the trailers, i was really excited because they past 5 years after the last one. I also saw with my family in 3D, and i really enjoy it. First let's talk about the animation, that is probably the best one in the franchise. All the colors, the characters designs, the scenarios,the action scenes, everything is fantastic in the animation. The humor is effective and it got some hilarious moments. The voice cast is really well done with talent voices of Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, James Hong, J.K Simmons, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and others makes the movie a really watchable time. The story is interesting and great to see a continuation of the second one in stated to reap it the same movie. The score of Hans Zimmer is beautiful as always and makes the action scenes and the emotional moments effective and fun. And the last good thing about the movie are the characters, they are really likable and they still being the same characters as we know it. My favorite character of the franchise is probably is Mr. Ping. Unfortunately, the movie has some defects. The biggest problem of the movie is that even is that funny, there are jokes that don't make me laugh like the testicle joke or when the same jokes of the movie are repeated, and sometimes make me think why they try to be the most funny movie of all like Shrek the Third did. Not even that the tone of the movie although it is not bad,it sometimes want to be Kung Fu Panda 1 for some of the jokes you have. And the last problem with the movie is its villain. Kai is not a very powerful or frighting villain like Lord Shen or Tai Long. It has some funny moments, the concept of the villain is really great, the design is fantastic and J.K. Simmons dose a great job, but his is the most weakest villain of the franchise. So yeah, this movie has been throwing by people calling the best of Kung Fu Panda series, the worst of the series or the weakest of the series. And yeah, I would lie if I said that this is the weakest one. But for the other hand, is better than Shrek the Third respect in the writing and humor. It's a shame that this couldn't have the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature because it could be great if Kung Fu Panda were the first trilogy in be nominated in that category. But, i think that the Kung Fu Panda franchise is the best franchise that Dreamworks give us. Kung Fu Panda 3 even is not the best one in the franchise is a really good sequel which knows that who to end and not be another shity franchise like Ice Age or The Land before Time. 8.9/10"
117,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,7 February 2017,"Worthwhile, charming and visually-stunning.","Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016) is worthwhile, charming, and visually-stunning. Personally, I have found the previous two entries in the series to be thoroughly entertaining. Yet again, this film proves to be tons of fun. It does not feel like a movie that is specifically pandering to kids, and in turn, will end up being enjoyable for the whole family. It also presents a genuinely positive message in an innocent-like manner. The action scenes are really fun and the quippy one-liners remain witty throughout. The voice cast does a decent job, with Jack Black once again being the driving factor. As for complaints, I would say that there are no shocks, twists, or anything that would implicate emotional investment. But hey, I really shouldn't be complaining about that kind of thing. It's Kung Fu Panda 3."
118,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,12 January 2017,Po stays lovable yet again,"Three installments in, the novelty of Jack Black voicing a clumsy, dopey and constantly awe-stricken warrior panda who overcomes all his obvious deficiencies has worn thin. That's a fact of any franchise that leans on the same conceit over and over. Still, there's something eternally lovable about Po the ""Dragon Warrior"" that makes ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" more enjoyable (or easier to stomach) than most of its animation franchise contemporaries.Although it's four and a half years later, the same creative team behind ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" returns for the three-quel, assuring a level of quality in the animation and storytelling. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson brought a greater degree of visual splendor to ""2,"" and in tandem with longtime DreamWorks animator and story artist Alessandro Carloni, ""3"" has comparably engaging visuals and kinetic energy.Writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger have been the mainstays of Po's adventures since the beginning. Although they didn't conceive the original 2008 story, they've scripted all three films alone, something that rarely can be said about animated films. They demonstrate in this latest chapter how well they know the hallmarks of the franchise they helped create and what the essential storytelling components are. In this adventure, the valley comes under attack by Kai (J.K. Simmons), a warrior bull that had been trapped in the spirit realm by Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim)  the wise turtle master of the previous films  for hundreds of years. Kai has mastered the ability to steal the chi of all things spirit and living, and stealing Oogway's chi has given him the strength to cross over. Now, Po must quickly master the mystical power of chi if there's any hope of stopping Kai.Although the problems and conflicts of all the films have been episodic, ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" completes the circle of Po's character arc. Po must constantly rise to the occasion despite improbable expectations being placed on his shoulders every time, and this film seems to complete his journey as Dragon Warrior. This thread gives the franchise a continuity that matters. Every lesson could be totally different in each film, but, as purveyors of children's content, the DreamWorks team behind these films recognizes the importance of reinforcement. All of Po's adventures tie back to the same ideas in different ways.The film also wraps up the mystery of Po's parentage as we quickly meet his birth father, Li (Bryan Cranston), who tells him pandas were the old masters of Chi and he can learn if he comes with him to the secret panda village where a host of new characters await. This is not good news as far as Po's adoptive father, Mr. Ping (James Hong), is concerned, and the film explores some challenging family dynamics in a sensitive way.The same kinds of jokes and slapstick from the previous movies persist in ""Kung Fu Panda 3,"" but they're not noticeably flatter than they were the last time. The same plot devices have been recycled, but they're no less engaging than they were the last time either. The same lessons can be learned from this film as the last couple times, but they're no less meaningful. All this to say ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a ""meets expectations"" sequel, and as the third movie in a franchise eight years running, ""meets expectations"" is a compliment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

119,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,30 December 2016,Surprisingly Entertaining,"Having never seen the original two ""Kung Fu Panda"" films, I really wasn't sure what to expect. Jack Black is hit or miss for me as far as comedy goes. He constantly seems to border the line between funny and annoying. I was pleasantly surprised after watching ""Kung Fu Panada 3"" to find that not only was Black's performance not over the top, but that this movie was overall enjoyable. I didn't really need to see the first two films to figure out that Po was a clumsy, over weight, under dog with a mysterious destiny. The jokes in this movie were delivered quite well, and neither felt forced or drawn out as is the case in far too many children's movies. Each character was likable in their own way and felt three dimensional, having individual personalities and flaws. Brian Cranston did a phenomenal job as Po's father. His interactions with Black's character felt natural, showing that the two veteran actors perform quite well together. The plot was a typical good versus evil story, with the twist being that Po was put in the position of teacher, as opposed to student. I wasn't expecting a deep story from a movie about talking animals doing martial arts, so I was not disappointed by the typical plot. This movie actually makes me want to watch the original films."
120,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,10 July 2016,Kung Fu Panda 3 is highly entertaining with lot of funny moments same as its predecessors.,"Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016): Kung Fu Panda is one of the most memorable animated characters in recent times.I am a huge fan of Po and its adventures as Dragon Warrior along with Furious five.They are one of the most entertaining movies and now its time for third part in the series,Kung Fu Panda 3.How is it??Plot: When Po's long-lost panda father suddenly reappears, the reunited duo travels to a secret panda paradise to meet scores of hilarious new panda characters. But when the supernatural villain Kai begins to sweep across China defeating all the Kung Fu masters, Po must do the impossible-learn to train a village full of his fun-loving, clumsy brethren to become the ultimate band of Kung Fu Pandas.Plus Points: 1)Screenplay: There is not even a single boring moment as usual as its previous parts.A lot of hilarious moments are present which makes us laugh out loud continuously,The scenes when Po visit his own village and meets his own kind,its both cute and hilarious.2)Animation: Dream Works always gives best output in animation and Kung Fu Panda is no exception from that.We have stunning animation and it definitely award winning work.Kudos to Animation department.3)Voice Cast: Kung Fu Panda's best pro is its voice cast.Jack Black as Po,Angelina Jolie as Tigress,Jackie Chan as Money and surprisingly J.K.Simmons gave voice for Kai in this movie,gave their best output.4)Music: Kung Fu Panda has brilliant music especially the theme of Kai is awesome.It is taken from I'm Sorry by Imagine Dragon.So Kung Fu Panda 3 is highly entertaining with lot of funny moments same as its predecessors.My Rating 8/10"
121,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,7 July 2016,The Student has become...,"... WELCOME TO PANDARIA!!!!!Ahahha, WoW joke ( World of Warcraft).But seriously, it was inevitable, what with the second films ending, that this would come to pass. Almost like a vision that a grand master would have of an dragon warrior. BUT I WANT REAL DRAGONS!All things have come full circle in a franchise that not only aimed to bring Chinese culture into the forefront of animated greats, but that whole swathes of newer gen children may remember fondly for all their days. Chock full of great fortune cookies o wisdom. The film just about did everything to remain true to the natures of its characters, without changing too much and getting away from its obviously successful formulae. I enjoyed it, all of it, the whole franchise, with this cementing it into my own memory as well as that of other adults no doubt.The main character finds his people with aid of his biological father, while coming to terms with the fact that the duck was the one whom raised him, thus also his true father. Much honor for the effort put into raising the future chosen one. The theme was certainly about acceptance of ones place in the universe, but always striving to better understand the inner workings of all life, not just that of the individual. Finding oneself also seems the central theme in the whole series too, so though kinda overly familiar, this film did well to close the loop and bring closure.Now will there be another film? OR Spin off? Why care, what does it matter? The film was a hit for the still young Oriental Dreamworks division out of China, and aside from the few hard to spot stereotypes that are in most animated films of the last decade ( this franchise included), this will resound as a story for the ages. NOW GO DO KUNG FU...PANDA!! WAAAAAAAH! JUDO Chop...whoops..thats not Chinese. :PMuch to learn have I."
122,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,4 July 2016,"This time no Skadoosh, but Chi time.","Three successful films in an animation franchise is a great achievement and according to the production house, yet another 3 films are going to hit the screens in a decade of time. So if you are an animation fan, especially 'Kung Fu Panda' and Po's fan, brace yourself for the future treats. This film was amazing. After two wonderful adventures, now this story has calmed down a bit with simplicity. Visually, it was spectacular with all those fight sequences, but the story was quite dramatised with enough comedies and then the final battle to conclude the 3rd installment on a high note.I think it was a well designed storyline in advance keeping in mind 5 to 6 films, that's why the flow was very smooth between all the three with those flashbacks placed at the right place. This particular part belongs to Pandas, the furious five were absent in most of the film, but good to see the return of Oogway. The master Oogway comes at the beginning and then during the end, though very happy for presence as he's my favourite character in this franchise. He's not a big player, but like Yoda, he's amazing and tell me who won't like him.This time no Skadoosh, but a new villain with a battle fought for a new powerful thing called Chi. Now Po got a promotion, so I'm very excited for the next film for how it will going to turn out. This is a beautiful family film and must not miss it. All the cast was returned from the previous two and a few more new were recruited and it is set in a new location for the most of the narration like the most of the animations has done in China. After all made in China is not so bad.8/10"
123,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,3 July 2016,Lovers Of The First Two Should Enjoy This Third Installment,"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" does not deliver any surprises to anyone who saw the first two films. But it is still a high quality film.The artwork is dense and impressive. And the Asian-themed environments are rendered in a multitude of ways, depending upon their context within the story and the ""viewpoint"" of the viewer. Regardless of how one feels about the story itself, he must acknowledge that the visuals are artistic masterpieces.The story hits all of the hot buttons for such a film: the battle between good and evil, the importance of friends and family, the value of believing in yourself. Being centered around a Buddhist view of the universe, the film is also full of the typical contradictions-as-truth outlook that can be viewed as mumbo jumbo or deepest wisdom. But there is one aspect of the film's morality that I find very important--it's assertion that ultimately the strength one needs to accomplish his goals comes from within. Yes, the hero has allies, but their story is more about recognizing the value of love and caring.I read that they are planning three more of these KFP films. I don't know if they can continue to offer value unless they find a way to transcend the first three in style or content. But KFP3 is a joy to watch and can entertain adults and children alike."
124,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,20 June 2016,Another Great Sequel!,"I don't know how they do it. Shouldn't sequels be awful? At least that is the rule of thumb but they somehow gave us another funny film with great visuals and action. I love the action, it just looks so good. Anyway, this film is about Po finding his father and having to battle a new boss villain. The villain is a grandmaster and the fight scenes are great, except for the final battle; which was lacking on the fist-to-fist kind of stuff but it is all good, this is just an animated eye-candy kind of flick. The comedy wasn't laugh out loud funny but more of an ""awwwww, look at that little cute thing, and that cute thing! And that even cuter thing!"" If you liked the other Panda movies you'll like this one. I'm giving it a 7.5 out of 10."
125,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,17 June 2016,The Vidiot Reviews...,"Kung Fu Panda 3China would have a higher panda population if it weren't for the country's one-cub policy.Fortunately, the lonely bear in this animated adventure has found that he has kin.Kung- Fu Master Po (Jack Black) inadvertently encounters his long-lost father (Bryan Cranston) around the same time a chi collecting villain (J. K. Simmons) escapes confinement and comes looking to collect the chosen one's enchanted essence.In order to defeat this newfound threat, Po must return with his father to a veiled panda village where he will learn to harness his inner energy for the imminent conflict.While this successful franchise has lost some luster over the years, this third installment shows little signs of fatigue, with the laughs, the animation and the fight sequences standing up to close scrutiny.Incidentally, the only real thing that a panda bear needs to be afraid of is life in a Western zoo enclosure.

126,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,10 June 2016,"Although lighter in substance than it's predecessor, KFP3 is a heartwarming family film that undoubtedly holds up.","Kung Fu Panda 3 was a surprising movie in all the right ways. It was definitely tough to follow up an already amazing sequel in Kung Fu Panda 2, but this film delivered, albeit in a different way than its predecessor. KFP3 is markedly more comedic than KFP2, and overall more jovial in tone, with its focus on the message of family and identity. Although for some the story felt hollow, for me personally it sufficed and felt particularly relevant in this day and age. The voice acting was impeccable, and the additions held up perfectly fine although there is a valid gripe to be found here. No spoilers, but some of the newly introduced characters felt underdeveloped and did not have enough screen time. The villain was excellently designed, a recurring strong point of the franchise. Though not quite as complex as Tai Lung or Shen, there are no doubts about how powerful the character is.A big characteristic of the film that stood out was how breathtakingly beautiful the world was drawn. Possibly the most aesthetically pleasing animated movie I've ever seen, I would definitely use some of the shots as wallpapers for my desktop. Furthermore, The action sequences were, as expected, well crafted without all of the blurry cuts that too many action movies cop out on today, although one could argue that the final fight between Po and the new villain was underwhelming. Overall highly entertaining and funny, KFP3 is a welcome addition to the series."
127,Kung Fu Panda 3,,1 June 2016,A movie that was made by geniuses!,"Man, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a darn good movie! It is one of my all time favorite dream works movies. It's original, fun, hilarious, has a great cast, and of course, it's totally AWESOME! I saw it TWICE in movie theaters and it was still just as good the second time as it was the first! When I saw that it had an 8.7 out of 10 the day before it came out, I thought it was a little over the top, but when I saw it, I thought it PERFECTLY deserved an 8.7. But now, a bunch of haters dropped it to a 7.3. IMDb staff, other users that liked it, please help me give it back an 8.7, because that is what it deserves! Once again, this is and will forever be one of my favorite dream works movies of all time."
128,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,28 May 2016,A whole new trilogy to enjoy.,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni. It is written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, and features the voices of Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, J. K. Simmons, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, Bryan Cranston, Kate Hudson, and James Hong. I really liked Kung Fu Panda 1 and 2 and I was super excited to see where they're going with the third one. If you've seen the the last two movies on this franchise, you pretty much know what you're getting into, very well animated action set pieces, character moments and a prophecy. In this movie, Po, the legendary dragon warrior, reunites with his long lost biological father. When a new threat arises from the spiritual realms, he then has two challenges in front of him, one supernatural and another very different, but much closer to his heart. Just like the last two, I really liked this movie from start to finish. The animation is glorious but what makes these movies as good as they are, is the character moments that make us feel for them. When they're fighting, you get thrilled at the amazing sequences filled with epic moments and great fighters, when they're not fighting, you're usually either laughing a lot, or feeling a lot. It knows when to be funny and when to get serious, and this is very important in such a movie. Sure, all three Kung Fu Panda movies are pretty similar in themes and emotion, but they're all great and build upon one another nonetheless. The villain Kai, voiced by the great J. K. Simmons, is truly a threat to the world of Kung Fu. He makes his presence known by doing great fights, and doing damage that no previous villain could do. Even though personally I like the second movie the most, and the villain Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) is still overall the best in my opinion, Kai is also very memorable and a strong villain in general. The score, composed by Hans Zimmer is unforgettable and really good, especially the Kai theme that helps him be even more mesmerizing and threatening. I loved this movie, not as much as the second one, but on par with the first one. Overall they're all just really entertaining and memorable animated movies, that are well directed and beautifully written."
129,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,19 May 2016,Awesome Movie,"Awesome movie of a panda. Panda's comedy was a killer and hilarious. It was a superb content. Including his family in the movie was prettier. Fighting scenes were thrilling, comedy & awesome. Nice graphics were used. Story was cool. Best part of movie I had watched was of moment of baby pandas. Villain(The Bull) was also awesome. Only something which was missing was... there was nothing for missing in these movie. Scene of killing the bull by panda was pretty good.The scene where all the family members of panda were fighting with zombie kung fu masters were the amazing part of the movie. Atlast want to say is it was the best movie of kung fu panda series."
130,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,11 May 2016,Family entertainer,"Kung Fu Panda is surely one of the best movie series ever made.Animation is good,dubbing is nice along with humor and good fight sequences.Movie is great family entertainment from start to finish with a lots of funny moments.Movie is fast paced along with character and story development.It's a beautiful movie, filled with likable characters and there will be a smile on your face throughout the movie.This is nearly perfect movie and it won't disappoint you.Overall I give this movie 9/10."
131,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,9 May 2016,Fun movie,"The Kung Fu Panda series is well made. It knows not how to overkill it by being released too often, and the stories -though nothing too deep- of course, do build on each other and keep developing characters that are really strong to start with.This of course also helped by a great voice cast. Here it is re enforced by Brian Cranston who just kills it. Seth Rogen stands out amongst the supporting characters and Jack Black really works as Po. Good stuff.Another thing to like about Kung Fu Panda is the visual efforts they put into it. The CG is great of course but the graphic sequences when they play with the Chinese influence and or do montages with collage type effects are rare and really well done.All in all it's fun way to spend 90minutes."
132,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,12 April 2016,A fantastic third part of a brilliant trilogy,"I love the first two kung fu panda films so when I found out this film was coming, I was very excited. The premise of this film sees po and the gang return to take down an old enemy who wants to rule all of china. He also has to connect with himself and learn about himself. Jack black is back as po the panda and he is as lovable as he has ever been in the role. His character is funny but likable but also has allot of depth in this film as he truly tries to develop into the hero that is possible. Bryan cranston plays his father in this film and he is just a brilliant addition to the franchise. He is so likable and has amazing chemistry with black that brings out the best in both of them. Also his character has tons of depth in this film as well as his character progresses. Jk simmons plays the villain kai and he is a fun bad guy. Yes he lacks a bit of depth to him but I did like his origin and I thought it was enough to make him a good villain. The others are good though such as dustin Hoffman as shiffu and Angelina jolie as tigress its just there not given tons of screen time but it does kind of work in this film. The story is good because it feels personal to po as he tries to develop into the warrior necessary to defeat the bad guy. This film has allot of good laugh s but it also has more great dramatic moments that make you really care about these characters. The script has some good laughs especially for the kids but sometimes for me the humour took more importance then the great drama which did disappoint me. The style is great with all the action scenes looking great and the animation being very unique for this franchise. Overall this is a fantastic continuation of these films and if your a fan is a must see."
133,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,19 April 2016,Kung Fu Panda 3: Expected family fun,"A lot of critics were worried that the latest addition to the Kung Fu Panda series would suffer the same fate as many trilogies. In a phrase: that is would crash and burn. Epically. The main concern was more for story line: cartoons typically only have a very simple plot and extending it further negates any special quality the first (or second) movie would have.That being said, the latest installment was a refreshing surprise. The movie both strengthened and negated the fear that trilogies make sense. For the most part, the actual plot never really adds up. Without spoiling anything, a basic look at the story would have any adult wondering: what in the world am I watching? At the same time, the smooth animation and great backdrops made for an enjoyable movie experience. If one has ever seen the first two films, the same type of charm and innocence can be expected from this latest film. Children, especially, will have fun watching this one.One thing to point out to film-viewers is the animation. Most of the film is CGI but there are some scenes that were 2D and hand-drawn. The seamless transition between the two make for a more visually-impacting experience. Also, there is something to be said about an enthusiastic voice-over cast that make for the whole movie to be fun and entertaining.At the end, this film deserves a high-rating because of what it offers: entertainment and laughter. People should not go inside the theater for something deep, or worse, an actual plot."
134,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,18 April 2016,It's a laughing riot with lots of messages for Parents,It's not only for the kids it is specially for the parents who wants their kids to be as successful as their neighbors' kids. Kung Fu Panda 3 is laughing riot with a potential learning experience for any parent.The weight is over and filled with fun and messages. Although I think they could have been more elaborate few stuffs instead of making it very crisp. But enjoyed a lot. 3d is way cooler than ever and Kai is my favorite villain so far. Hans Zimmer is my god of music he gives always a tune to hum. I am fanboying out here and waiting for the next 3 more installments of the franchise as promised by DreamWorks team.
135,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,14 April 2016,Decent kids movie,"Po the lovable Panda continues his journey of enlightenment by mastering Chi in order to combat an ancient re-incarnated spirit. The movie is pleasant and engaging without ever having the level of threat the villains in the first two movies generated.The visuals are sumptuous and gorgeous and worth the admission alone. Po is amusing as ever, teetering between childish enthusiasm and moral obligation. We are introduced to Po's biological family (to the jealous disapproval of his adoptive father), who are all beautifully drawn and voicedThe problem is the villain, who, while being the most visually impressive bad guy so far, is in fact the least threatening. I hope this is the last KFP, I'm afraid the franchise will outstay its welcome if a fourth is attempted.This is a good movie, but not quite as good as the first two."
136,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,14 April 2016,The Kung Fu Panda Series:Part 3.,"Despite having heard about them for years,I have never got round to seeing any of the movies in the Kung Fu Panda series.During the last week of Easter,a friend asked if there were any good family movies out that she and her kids would enjoy.Taking a look at the family flicks that had recently arrived,I was happy to spot that the third Panda title had just come out,which led to me getting ready to see a panda perform kung Fu for the first time.The plot:Taking all the chi (power) from Kung-Fu masters, Kai sets his sights on getting the last of the chi from Master Shifu's clan. Announcing his retirement Shifu passes the role of group leader to Po (who lost his dad years ago).Originally excited,Po soon finds that mastering the art of chi is harder than he ever expected.Whilst trying to train others to the best of his abilities,Po notices that a fellow Panda called Li Shan has entered the village,who is looking for his lost son. Oblivious to the obvious, Po and Shan are told that they must be related.As Po and Shan catch up on lost time, Kai enters the village, determined to get the final chi.View on the film:Ironing out the acid-tongue from his live action roles, Bryan Cranston gives a very good performance as Li Shan,with Cranston rolling around in a sincere and playful mood.Joined by a thunderous J.K. Simmons as boo-hiss baddie Kai,Jack Black gives a wonderfully energetic performance as Bo,whose lively vocals from Black gives the action scenes a frantic energy.Spanning a running time of just over 90 minutes,the screenplay by Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger moves at a lightning pace,by the writers using a light touch of mysticism to keep the cracking bamboo Kung-Fu and adventure tightly together.Largely avoiding the chance to lay things on thickly,the writers deliver the message of Po being his best self-possible with a light touch which helps to give Po's battle with Kai a real sense of purpose.For the first US animated film to be co-produced by a Chinese film,directors Alessandro Carloni & Jennifer Yuh Nelson send Po and his gang into a dazzlingly stylised world,where vibrant Anima-style backgrounds light the sky.Exploring the origins of ""Chi"" the directors overlay the bold CGI animation with delicate cell-drawn- style animation flashbacks,which give the elegant sections a folk tale atmosphere.Building up to the big fight between Po and Kai,the writers hit the action scenes with an impressive crispness,which go from giving each fight a clear sense of scale,and also making each karate chop land with a sun-drenched thump,as Po becomes the Chi Kung-Fu panda."
137,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,14 April 2016,Kung Fu Panda 3 is just as adorable as its predecessors.,"Po is back with his unceasing shenanigans. The humour he manages to squeeze out with a droll face and his non-stop clumsy acts is just A1. Ice that up with the perfect comic delivery of Jack Black, and we get a Panda that just takes it up to another level of awesomeness. He still gets awestruck by trivial things. Still does all the things that he used to, to throw you into fits of laughter. Kung Fu Panda 3 is yet another installment that doesn't stop at nothing to make you giggle whilst you chomp on your popcorn.The movie is an info-taining lesson that teaches us a lot of crucial stuff like teamwork, improvisation, support, brotherhood, unity and forgiveness. CGI is just as great as the previous installments. If you are looking for fun, boy this movie is nothing but the Kung ""Fun"" Panda 3! SPOILERS BOUNCING AHEAD: Sticking to its origin when it comes to the plot, where we always get served a badass villain who ends up getting ridiculed by the cloddish mien of our protagonist, we are offered a fixed mainstream storyline when it comes to fighting bits. Exploring a little softer side we find a pleasant addition to the tale in the form of Li, the biological father of Po. He is equally upbeat and cool like Po.Plot delves into darker waters as we find Li tricking Po into visiting his village convincing him to teach him Chi. Bubbly as Po is he gets sold to the faux story and walks, nay, clambers his way towards the awesome village of even cuter Pandas who overwhelm him with their unique acts. Kai, the ruthless villain from the spirit realm rummages through their village to have a final face-off against our hero. A complete entertaining package! If you look at the downsides, things go in a lot of fantastical zone like the introduction of Chi, learning which should be a Herculean task for the Panda town. But they ace it in a jiffy. So, wasn't tangible exactly, but then again isn't the movie entirely fictional already? So, overlooking everything incredible in the Panda series, I come to the bottom-line: A great entertainer!"
138,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,13 April 2016,A Tale of My Two Dads,"At least it was three times better than Shrek the Thirdeven though that had a more clever title.This one took a while to warm up to. Sure, it's gorgeous to look at  I mean, LOOK at those hairs on the pandas, but the comedy and story was slow for a minimum of the first third of the film. Then, finally it got funny, slowed down, clichéd, and finally back on track. Totally less of a movie than the first two and probably didn't need to be made and yetstill totally worth seeing. It was fun, and nice to hear everyone totally on board with their voice work. Basically and simultaneously, Panda Po meets his father and is stalked by a power-hungry, soul-stealing creature from True Blood's season 2. Learning about one's self, place and doing a little Ewok fighting can carry a short animated film, thank goodness.It's harmless and charming. It's not regrettable, though completely inferior. Not so sure there should be a 4 or more (like I've heard planned,) but as long as they take their time with the script, it's welcome.***Final thoughts: Actually, make that: make this the last. Not that it was bad, per se, but the same jokes are wearing thin. Don't beat the almost- dead horse like Shrek did."
139,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,11 April 2016,Another fun production in the Kung-Fu Panda franchise,"Kung-Fu Panda has hit it's 3rd movie in the franchise bringing us more fun and excitement from Po and his ninja warrior friends. Following the basics of the first and second movies, we see Po face off against yet another villain and learn more about where he came from. Even though it is made for kids, adults can still clearly enjoy the fun and humour brought to us by Dreamworks. While a few kids movies out there have burnt out by the second or third sequel, Kung Fu Panda 3 still brings as many laughs and enjoyable scenes as the first 2. Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, Duston Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu and David Cross all come back to voice very familiar characters with the addition of Kate Hudson and J.K.Simmons. Alessandro Carloni joins Jennifer Yuh Nelson for his first directing role in a major film. Definitely a must-see if you've seen 1 and 2."
140,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,9 April 2016,"Funny, very funny, albeit mediocre in overall","The movie franchise still retains its likability by having it's third installment full of chuckles. There are tons of laughter here and there spread out to both main and side characters. It feels like there's only little room to breathe between those comedies, except for those small parts where the movie goes nostalgic of Po. Yet this has the movie driven into an unbalanced state as it felt lacking in other terms. The movie's pace feels to fast as there's little transition between scenes. The villain gets into the movie very quickly, relying only to an old character that's supposed to be dead already. The conflict and its resolution also feels too much forced that the movie ends quite abruptly. Then again the movie's fun laughters will suffice to bring good ratings in."
141,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,9 April 2016,Enjoyed watching but could lacked the punch of previous 2 movies,I watch Kung Fu Panda series for 2 reasons1. It's just pure fun. Hilarious. Period 2. It gives a lot of good lessons of life and quotes to remember.While the 3rd in the series didn't lack on the first thing but I felt the philosophical depth of this one was not in the same standard. Also the length could have been extended by 10 mins and the training part of the Panda village should have taken that slot. One cannot learn Kung Fu in so easily - it is not trivial. Summary - I enjoyed the movie and will recommend. But this will not be something I wil watch over & over & over again like the first part.
142,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,8 April 2016,Great film,"I think this film is as good as the first but not quite as good as the second. Nonetheless, it's still a great addition to the franchise and tied up the loose ends left by the previous movies. It feels like a good end to the Kung Fu Panda movies. A fourth movie would be nice, as long as the script is good, but if the writers can't come up with anything, they should still be proud to have ended the franchise on a high note.I liked Kai, although he wasn't as good as Shen. While Shen was unique to the Kung Fu Panda franchise, oozing a deranged yet elegant intimidation with just the right sprinkling of humour, Kai shares similarities with Tai Lung, such as a degree of intimidation but just a little too much humour and a back-story with one of the franchise's mentors, in this case, Oogway. However, that doesn't make Kai a badly written character. His back-story with Oogway was good and he was portrayed as a guy who was previously brave and loyal but became twisted by his own greed. Furthermore, Kai is somewhat sympathetic because Oogway erased every trace of him apart from his own personal scroll about their relationship after sending him to the Spirit World, so it's understandable that he would be ticked off for having his legacy destroyed. He was too similar to Tai Lung to be a brilliant villain like Shen was but I think the writers and voice actor J.K. Simmons handled him pretty well despite that.What I like about this film is that it touches on possibilities about what happens after we die. Not many films do that due to people's understandable fear of death. I originally interpreted the Spirit World as being the afterlife, which led to confusion about Kai's apparent destruction - if he's already dead, how could he die again? - until my mother mentioned the possibility that the Spirit World was actually Purgatory, in other words the place between life and death. It was shown to be possible to return from the Spirit World so it could be argued that anyone residing there isn't truly dead. Oogway's line ""I live here"" rather than ""I reside here"" lends weight to that theory as it implies that he's still attached to the mortal world. Like Po, Oogway could probably return to life if he wanted to but he was clearly content to stay in the Spirit World. However, when Kai exploded from the force of Po's chi, he was pushed beyond the boundary between life and death, ensuring he could never return to the mortal realm again.I liked Oogway's scenes, although I wish he had a bit more screen time. I think he's a great character and his connection to Kai explains more about his long life. I also liked that both Oogway and Kai were connected to the very same Panda village where Li lived. One complaint I have is how did Tigress find the supposedly secret village? Li said that no non-Panda's were supposed to know where it was but Tigress got there before Kai, who visited the same village five hundred years ago. To be fair, Kai found the village by accident in a snowstorm five centuries earlier, so he may have had trouble remembering the way but even so, at least he had some idea of where he was going. I suppose Tigress could have tracked Po but I don't remember the previous films establishing her as a tracker, although maybe the writers assumed we would guess that from the fact that she's a feline.Po, Shifu and the Furious Five were also done well, with Mantis and Crane even getting a scene to themselves. I liked the scene where Shifu, Tigress, Monkey and Viper fought Kai and the possessed Mantis and Crane. My favourite member of the Furious Five is Tigress, partially because she's voiced by the fantastic and beautiful Angelina Jolie, one of the greatest actresses alive. I liked seeing Tigress' maternal side, which is shown in the television series but hasn't been seen before in the movies. I'm glad that they maintained her friendship with Po without giving any indication that it could go further. If this were another franchise, chances are the writers would probably have the male main character and the powerful female character get together but here, Po and Tigress are more like brother and sister. Although Tigress is my favourite member of the Furious Five, I wish that Viper was given more screen time, as I think she's the most underrated of the group. Lucy Lui is also a great actress who wasn't given enough lines in this movie.Po's dad Li is a likable character. I guessed that he was lying about knowing the chi practices used by his ancestors but unlike many ""liar revealed"" story lines, it's not too obvious that he's lying until the revelation scene. There are hints from his behavior but it's subtle and I like that. And of course, Li's just being a protective father. I like how he and Mr Ping bonded over the course of the movie and realized that they could both be father figures to Po. Mr Ping's concern that he might steal Po away from him was understandable since Li was Po's biological dad, but the two of them actually worked well together once Mr Ping got over his jealousy.I wouldn't call it perfect but this is still a great movie and a worthy addition to the franchise. I don't feel that it's essential to add a fourth movie. The second movie basically confirmed that this movie was coming due to the cliffhanger with Li but in this film, everything has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. If they do make another film, they had better do it right because I don't want this franchise to get ruined just to make the people involved richer."
143,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,8 April 2016,Go Kungfu fighting..,"Everyone's favourite Po, the Panda is back and full credit to the animation team of Dreamworks to make him look so 'awesome'. Jack Black's voice-over is as energetic and passionate, if not more than in it's first instalment. From the trailers, it was clear than many new characters were to be introduced. None more bigger (and plumpier) than Po's dad Li (he's more Chinese looking) and his entire village of adorable furry fat , dumpling loving pandas. And not to forget 'Kai', the fearsome but funny new adversary from the spirit world voiced masterly by J.K.Simmons.Although the plot follows a familiar and predictable path, the dialogues and the drawings make up for it. Thankfully, there are multiple scenes where the pandas happily engage in pure fun activities (I did feel a little jealous). My personal beloved character Grand Master Oogway is also back with his brilliant quotes and effervescent smile. Even as a statue, the smile assures us of inner peace.The first instalment focused on delivering many messages ('There are no accidents!'). While the second part preferred story telling, this one is the right mix. I'd like to list down a few of such golden learnings with your permission below:The more you take, the less you have Never underestimate the power of a dramatic entrance If you only do what you can do, you will never be more than what you are Always listen to your master Having another person in your beloved's life doesn't mean less for you, it means more for your beloved Sometimes we do wrong things for the right reason I'm not trying to turn you into me, I'm trying to turn you into you And most important of all, Never give up!Do watch the movie to see how beautifully the above have been integrated into the narrative.Only thing I wish for more from this movie were a few more dialogues for the Furious Five (especially the monkey). A movie which dwells into their past may help! Everybody, go kungfu fighting..."
144,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,8 April 2016,Absolutely beautiful to look at,"Panda Po, despite being a bit of a numskull, has got quite good at kung fu, and Shifu retires, what with there being nothing further he can teach him other than how to control chi (which Shifu can't do anyway). This coincides with meg-chi thief Kai escaping from the spirit world, where he had been exiled by turtle spiritual master Oogway, and coming to steal chi from Po and everyone else in the panda village, where Po has been living having recently met Li, his birth father.I'm not a big fan of Jack Black, and the previous Kung Fu Panda movies haven't set my world ablaze, but this one is great. The story is strong, and carries some deep (but not overstressed) subtexts about familial jealousy and love, and never giving up, being true to yourself and so on. The voice talent is excellent. But, most of all, this film is utterly gorgeous. Both the production design and the animation are absolutely dazzling: I can't recall the last time I saw a film as beautiful as this is. The 3D is pretty good, too.Highly recommended."
145,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,6 April 2016,"Enjoyable For The Kids, Maybe Not So Much For The Adults","I was a little bit on the fence when thinking about whether I was excited to see Kung Fu Panda 3 or not. On the one hand, I adore all things furry and all things animated so I should be the ideal die-hard fan of this franchise. However on the other hand, I can't say I really enjoyed the first two. Not to say that they were bad movies, they just never stood out in my mind so whilst I didn't hate them I clearly didn't love them either.After watching Po, voiced by the electrically awesome Jack Black, embark on his latest adventure I have to say that I am feeling the same indifference towards this latest installment. Whilst visually stunning, I can't say the story really wowed me. It moved at the right pace, and really tapped in to Ancient Chinese history whilst swiftly tying in three character conflicts  Po becoming a Chi master, Po connecting to his real-life father Li (Bryan Cranston taking a slight diversion from his Walter White days) and the menacing Kai (Academy Award® winner J.K. Simmons) who is using every kung fu warrior he can find as pawns in a bid to get revenge for a 500-year old grudge against Oogway.Although this is a children's film, I would expect the same depth of character exploration as any other genre but perhaps on a simpler scale. This was certainly covered in the stories of Po, Li and even Po's adoptive father, Mr. Ping. Unfortunately, it seemed like other characters were just thrown in with no real purpose at all, despite the big name celebrity attached to them (such as Kate Hudson's dancing delight Mei Mei). Even poor Lucy Liu, who voices Viper, perhaps had three lines in the entire film.Children will definitely enjoy this crazy, comedic and action-packed visual delight however unfortunately I think the adult audience members might find themselves hungry for more dumplings.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com"
146,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,3 April 2016,The most visually stunning animated movie of all time. The best of the three Kung Fu Panda films.,"Kung Fu Panda 3 continues with the adventures of Po(Jack Black). After the events of Kung Fu Panda(2008) & Kung Fu Panda 2(2011), Po, Tigress(Angelina Jolie), Crane(David Cross), Mantis(Seth Rogen), Viper(Lucy Liu) & Monkey(Jackie Chan) continue to protect the Valley of Peace. Shifu(Dustin Hoffman) tells Po, that he has to move on to the next phase of his training. Po's biological father Li(Bryan Cranston), is finally reunited with his son. However, everything doesn't stay rosy, as Oogway's(Randall Duk Kim) old nemesis, the evil Kai(J.K. Simmons), returns. Now, it is up to Po, with the help of the Furious Five, Shifu & a motley crew of pandas, to put an end to Kai & his reign of terror. Kung Fu Panda 3 is a spectacular film. Just when you think the Kung Fu Panda movies have already reached the pinnacle of awesomeness, along comes this installment that blows your supremely high expectations, out of the water. The animation is top notch. The locations you see on screen look extremely lifelike & gorgeous. The Kung Fu set pieces are awe inspiring. The climactic fight scene between, Po & Kai is the highlight of the film. The 3D is eye-popping & transfers you to this magical universe. The chief highlight of the film are the various new cute & cuddly panda characters we meet, in the secret panda village. The voice acting is spot on. Jack Black is outstanding as Po/Lotus. Black effortlessly brings a childlike energy, to the titular character. Bryan Cranston is spectacular as Li. Cranston's endearing voice-over as Po's father, is the polar opposite of his famous role as anti-hero Walter White on hit drama series, Breaking Bad(2008-2013). Dustin Hoffman is superb as Shifu. Angelina Jolie is amazing as Tigress. J.K. Simmons is perfect as the menacing Kai. Jackie Chan is good as Monkey. Seth Rogen is hysterical as Mantis. Lucy Liu is impressive as Viper. David Cross is awesome as Crane. Kate Hudson is great as Mei Mei. James Hong is adorable as Mr. Ping. Randall Duk Kim is effective as Oogway. Kung Fu Panda 3 is a must watch for people of all ages, fans of the franchise & newcomers alike. Go, watch the awesomeness unfold!"
147,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,2 April 2016,Po is back with his gang and he is awesome and funny as always!,"Po, our beloved Panda is back with his antics and underdog heroism in his latest adventure in Kung Fu Panda 3. I have to admit, I have been an avid fan of the Kung Fu Panda franchise movies and dedicatedly watched and re-watched each movie, enjoying it every time and am so happy to say that the third installment is again an entertainer.In this movie, Po is challenged by Kai, a Yak warrior from the spirit world who has come back to our world to rule and the only obstacle in his path is Po, the Dragon Warrior. While strong, Po is no match against Kai's strength and will have to train himself and evoke new hidden powers inside him to battle this new villain.We meet Po's long lost father in this movie and while the movie could have been serious, the makers have succeeded in making this one a funny, entertaining, sometimes emotional, sometimes adorably cute and totally action packed.The movie is not your usual serious superhero flick but made with children in mind so it's never very serious and any somber mood is instantly lightened with a comic event or a cute antic from the characters who are all so memorable that I had them in my mind long after watching the movie.The narrative is strong, the plot well executed and the voices rendered to the characters flawless. Dreamworks have employed their very impressive skills in bringing to us spellbindingly realistic imagery and effects that are memorable and whether you are kid or an adult, you are sure to fall in love with the images. This movie has some impressive 3D effects so I would suggest that you watch it in 3D to get the full impact.All in all, Kung Fu Panda 3 is full of entertainment, fun and promises a time well spent. Suited to both kids and adults, this one is a slightly goofy, sometimes emotional and other times inspiring but always entertaining story of Po, the beloved fat Panda who became the Dragon Warrior but still cant climb steps without panting! 4 out of 5 to it from me. Go watch and enjoy this movie with your family.This review is also available on Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff"
148,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,2 April 2016,Kung Fu Panda 3 was epic!!!,"Kung Fu Panda 3 was epic! I really enjoyed watching Kung Fu Panda 3. (This may or may not be a spoiler. I'll just say it anyway, but beware...)I really loved the focus on the idea of chi throughout the movie. It worked great. The characters were as alive and hilarious as they always were. I love the feeling this franchise gives you - the Kung Fu Panda movies are feel-good movies that never fail to bring your mood up and make you laugh. This is a film - and franchise as a whole - that people of all ages will enjoy watching. The humour is just perfection. The combination of drama and comedy in the action scenes was amazing. The people who created this franchise are geniuses. It's in my all-time faves. I absolutely loved it!!"
149,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,31 March 2016,Another Kung-Fu Panda Classic,"A fast paced movie with the classic characters and the inimitable Panda jokes. The graphics are excellent with no faults in any-way. The story is fast paced enough to keep the mind from wandering. The actions scenes are fast paced and entertaining, as are the dialogues, as always. The jokes though routine slapstick Panda jokes but make for good laughter at times. Although the benchmark for all the Kung Panda series is the first movie, and though no one has done better than the original but the subsequent series have not been boring or mundane which is usually the problem with most serial movies. Highly recommended for audiences of all ages."
150,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,31 March 2016,"Some details are a little illogical, but great movie to watch overall","Went to see the Pandas with my partner after these two wonderful prequels, with warning from my friends that this film is not as good as the others, we still have lots of fun and laughters and, of course, lessons.There is an important come-back in this part, though little, still proves to be the greatest master. Love the idea of the panda family - that's where strength really comes from. However, the way that ""strength"" is unleashed is a little confusing to us both - is it just love from the heart, from the father, the friends, or is it of some other source of spiritual belief - still caught me thinking. As usual, our hero comes back super at the end, but yet does not impress me quite well.Leaving all that behind, Kung Fu Panda 3 is hilariously fun and relaxing. Everything is cute, from the drawings, lines, fightings, tricks (haha). We laughed from the beginning til the end. Storyline is also easy enough to catch up even for children, and we are happy that finally our Pandan Hero manages to find out who he truly is. Satisfactory."
151,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,30 March 2016,Very good but not great,"Speaking as an adult, who probably should not have watched the movie in the first place, but anyway. For kids, this will be the most awesome movie they will ever see. It's nicely done, lively and full of messages and values such as family and friendship.Now, for all of us that still watch animated movies in our early or late thirties, this movie is nothing special. Nice animations, some jokes here and there but nothing special. The Kung-Fu Panda franchise is coming to an end with this one. For me, it failed to captivate adult audiences as much as other franchises like Shrek did. Maybe this was not their target, but it needs to be said. I watched it and enjoyed it with no complaint or any desire to just stop watching it, but I was not thrilled or amazed. The script writers could have done a better job in coming up with a storyline instead of doing the easy thing which was to get some super villain to appear and have him fight Kung-Fu Panda. It was too easy of an escape for them and I think that this was reflected in the final outcome. I hope that if they decide to resurrect it for a forth one, it will be with a much richer script."
152,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,28 March 2016,I really noticed the enhanced graphics,"What I really noticed in this was the enhanced animations, it seemed like they had really done something in the rendering process and that reflected on the style, color and animations, it was all very sharp and beautiful.This is still a very entertaining story, it is still a bit silly or stupid in ways (thats a good thing) and it still has profiles and voices that really makes the story come to life and be great. I did feel that this story was lacking a bit, maybe it was because we knew more of what it was about, maybe it was just the story that wasn't that new, i don't know exactly what it was, but I liked the first and second one better.My kids were very much entertained and my wife and I was also, but I think my kids understood more of the references and could see the small stories in the different scenes and it was a very good experience to see this, it is still a family movie, because the fighting and so on is not dangerous it's just animals in some way and they are making fun all the time :)Location, seating & time: Atlas, Rødovre, Denmark - Bio 4, row 8 seat 1, 2, 3 & 4 - 26.03.2016 at 12.40"
153,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,26 March 2016,The panda returns!,"Living large and loving life, Po realizes that he has a lot to learn if he's going to fulfill the next challenge from his beloved instructor. After reuniting with his long-lost father, Po must transition from student to teacher and train a group of fun-loving, clumsy pandas to become martial-arts fighters. Together, the kung-fu brethren unite to take on the evil Kai, a supernatural warrior who becomes stronger with each battle.I am really proud the way they did not take out the humour in this film, especially turning the antagonist into a laughable but quite terrifying character. It follows the film's predecessors greatly and continues to outshine all the other dreamworks' films. This film has it all you expect. The storyline is just brilliant and dazzling, and it follows perfectly from Kung Fu Panda 1 and 2's storyline to this, while now Po is the master of his master. Perfect film, quite hilarious and exciting to watch. Filled with plenty of mild action for the kids and quite an improvement over Kung Fu Panda 2, since the previous film provided a darker story but was also laughable. Kung Fu Panda 3, a film with a whimsical sense of humour."
154,Kung Fu Panda 3,10,25 March 2016,Awesome!Very funny!Very emotional!Great ending to this trilogy,"Kung Fu Panda 3 was an amazing end to this amazing trilogy..I have absolutely enjoyed it..First of all,its very funny..Like the previous 2 movies,this was very very humorous and I laughed a lot..It was very emotional too especially in the end..This movie answers every questions we had in our mind which are: 1-What is the true meaning of the DRAGON WARRIOR? 2-Who is Po? 3-Why did Oogway choose Po as the dragon warrior in the first movie? In the first movie,Po saved his village,in the second movie Po saved kung fu and China..Now,in this 3rd movie,Po have to save the whole universe.. As Oogway said ""The Universe needs the DRAGON WARRIOR"" You must watch this movie!"
155,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,25 March 2016,"Third film in the franchise, still offers a new experience","Kung Fu Panda 3 is the third film in the successful franchise and caps off what is a surprisingly quite enjoyable series of films. The first film was a huge success and loved by families and kids everywhere, the second one for me was a slight step down but still alright and this film was actually a good amount of fun. At the third film is where you start to see most franchises getting very repetitive, and while the film follows a similar base plot from start to finish, it still offers a new experience that sets it aside from other animated films. The plot was basic, easy to follow and enjoyable, the humour was there, and the character performances were once again very fun. In terms of the plot, as i mentioned it was very easy to follow, it had the good guys, the evil threat, and other real world themes that make the film relatable to people watching. Having the main target audience of young kids, they didn't need to make anything complex, they just had to please them and give something for the families to enjoy, and they did that well. It does have sections that are not as eventful as the rest of the film but overall the pacing was at a nice steady pace. Humour-wise the film delivered, i laughed a number of times throughout the film, it did have its fair share of humour that was directed at the kids but overall there was a good amount to keep me engaged. At this point, you know whats going to happen and how the film is going to end, but you won't enjoy it any less.The thing i love the most about this franchise is the voice talent involved, and how every actor/actress gives each character a very unique personality that makes them all very unique. You already have Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogan, Lucy Liu, Kate Hudson, and David Cross in there, so by adding Bryan Cranston and J.K Simmons it only makes the film so much better. Simmons especially i thought was fantastic as the villain and he was a really cool villain. So in the end, this was quite an enjoyable film that is a lot of fun i think for the whole family. Easy plot, good performances, and some humour make this a pretty good film. It's just now dawning on me that this was a better movie than Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice, would i rather watch BvS? Of course, but in terms of a film that succeeded in doing what it set out to do, this takes the cake. 7/10"
156,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,25 March 2016,Another Kung Fu Panda Movie.  Should Make For Some Fun Times!,"This review will have some spoilers so go read a book if you don't want spoilers. Kung Fu Panda 3 is the third installment of the surprisingly successful Kung Fu Panda series. And to be honest with you guys, I like them all basically the same amount! They're all great and funny. So when I walked out of this movie I was wondering what movie I liked the best. The first, second, or third. Kung Fu Panda keeps its series going strong and if it can keep going I'll take 4 or 5 maybe even 6 movies. It's hard for a trilogy to be as solid as Kung Fu Panda. Because there is always a movie that isn't quite as good as the rest. Indiana Jones: The Temple of Doom. Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. Jurassic Park: Jurassic Park 3. Toy Story, Lord of the Rings, and the Dark Knight are the only movies that I can think of who have solid trilogies. Now we can put Kung Fu Panda on that list!This movie was great. I liked the villain a lot more than I thought I would. J.K. Simmons, I love you man. I liked the music a lot too! Hans Zimmer has shown once again he can make a good soundtrack. The characters were great. I loved Po's father, I loved his step-dad more than I usually do. The action was great. It was just straight up a great movie. Do I have any flaws with this movie? Yes. But it's so little I really walked out of this movie not really caring. Neither do I care to tell you.So that is my thoughts on Kung Fu Panda 3! It was just a solid movie that I ended up loving more than I thought I would. Thank you for reading my thoughts of Kung Fu Panda 3."
157,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,23 March 2016,"A nice, if somewhat tame, ending to the franchise.","For me, the first two Kung Fu Panda movies are on a league of its own. Sure, at first look, they may seem like standard kiddie fare, but they're leaps and bounds ahead from it. Whether it's the impeccable production design, the amazingly choreographed fighting sequences or the deep, somewhat dark themes that lie under the comedic story lines, there's always been a handful of reasons why this franchise has the potential to appeal to both children and adults like myself. Which brings us to this last installment, which is not a bad film by any means, but certainly sets itself more on the kid's side of the spectrum.The story picks up right after the ending of part 2, where we learn that Po's father, Li Zhan, is still alive and living in a secret village full of pandas. The action moves to this place with a new cast full of colorful and fun characters in addition to some returning faces that aid Po in his quest to stop the evil spirit warrior Kai from stealing the chis (energy) of all the warriors in China.Kids will love the film, while parents and older folks in general will likely appreciate the detailed, gorgeous animation, some racy jokes and cultural references, the great score by Hans Zimmer and (if they're fans of the franchise) the fact that the franchise comes full circle. In conclusion, Kung Fu Panda 3, while more juvenile than the previous entries, still feels true to the spirit of the characters and settings previously established and provides a satisfying conclusion to Po's journey in what seems to be the ending (if Dreamworks doesn't get greedy...) to the film franchise.8 out of 10."
158,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,23 March 2016,movie is good ..............but it misses something,"i have loved first two parts of the movie very much ..... but , coming to this one i felt that starting and ending of the movie is awesome but it misses something gripping at middle of the storymovie was awesome enough for children but for normal movie lovers it must have intense story line that how PO would learn the technique of CHI,except that movie has every thing to be amazed. there is no comparing form two parts but it misses the middle part of the movie, middle plot of movie's story line not much of convening it just simply comes to end"
159,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,19 March 2016,"Kung Fu Panda is a wonderful fun movie, and it looks great!","I just saw Kung FU Panda 3, and it was really good. It is probably my second favorite of all three, the first one being the best. But the story in this one is good, but not as good as the second nor first. What makes it awesome is the characters, the mind blowing visuals and art, and just the drama. I said that the story is not as good, but the characters and the drama is so well made here that it makes it better then the second one FOR ME. I saw Zootopia and i would say this is right next to it for me in 2016. I recommend it to go see it with a friend, or a sibling. Its very fun, dramatic, nice fight scenes, mind blowing visuals that made my mouth open and its just, a great fun time! One problem tho is that the villain is not so fleshed out, the first and second one are much better."
160,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,19 March 2016,Entertaining,"I wasn't expecting this to be fun but both me and the kids where having a good time so Kudos on an underdog kindda of success of a trilogy!!!This movie manages to hit the sweet spot where both adults and kids can enjoy it without the double entendre thing other movies where going for (yes zootopia I'm looking at you!), just good clean fun and playing dodge ball with your expectations.For example, instead of changing the pandas in a day into masters of kung fu via the magical training montage they say... you know what? yeah that's never going to happen, you are not Po and Po is not a kung fu teacher. what you are are pandas so lets play to your strength!Then you get the quirky montage full of home alone like trap training.There are a few problems in this movie that stuck out like a sore thumb though. Because it came out the same time as Zootopia I ended up comparing the two, the art work was probably a stylistic choice but it looked gritty and... a little cheap, at least compared to the lush Disney animation. you can see that most of the budget went towards the money shots that looked very impressive in 3D.Another problem was the moral of the story, be you... this was the moral in the first installment and to a lesser extend the second, did we really need to hear it a third time?One more issue was the villain, he was too comedic to be considered a proper villain, which is a shame because the past two movies had really memorable ones.I had a personal problem with one of the Panda characters. Mei Mei the Ribbon Dancer (voiced by Kate Hudson) did they really think spoofing Melissa McCarthy was funny? it's not funny when she does it and it's not going to be funny when a panda does it.... just.. no... NO!Admittedly they were all minor issues, the movie was really funny and in the scene where the pandas raised their paws to give Po their Chi I actually saw not just children but adults doing that in solidarity with the movie. If you want something fun and light to watch over the weekend then this is the perfect movie for you and your family."
161,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,17 March 2016,"""The Third Installment Arrives With More Visual Lucidity And Humor""","The dragon warrior finds his family and returns with more verve and visual dynamism than in the previous installments.Visual credulity begins from the moment of opening the film where Po Panda climbing endless stairs to make the logo of Dreamworks. The integration of new characters is accompanied eastern aesthetic environment and good jokes of the panda to make a family film full of action and adventure for boys and big. There is an animation and beautiful photography. I have fixed me that animation films of ""Kung Fu Panda"" is not fully detailed in their funds, but a blue sky sea water or a simply pink sunset is most magical and deeper than a location details (""Zootopia""), this buoyant and sophisticated effect can be seen in the opening bout.This small and perhaps unenforceable detail is one of the great pleasures of Jack Black's films. Of the few successful projects of ""Dreamworks Animation"" ""Kung Fu Panda"", ""Shrek"" and ""Madagascar"" have been the face of the Studio, although these two latest already they have no chance, the bear panda still has more to give. Like its predecessors (2008-2011) this third entry is full of brilliance and visual warmth. The story doesn't feel loose and with its good development pervades easily with the audience.Kai (JK Simmons) has returned for revenge, then that teammate had apparently betrayed him. For this the ox with irritated eyes steals the essences of life of teachers more powerful of the Kung Fu and unfortunately in his list appears Po (Jack Black). Meanwhile on Earth, the master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) headquarters his throne to the funny panda nothing more in order to find who is the panda. Po finds his lost father and embark on an expedition to a habitat full of mammals. There he will have to learn and teach his family martial arts to eventually fight with the furious animal. Directors Alessandro Carloni (DreamWorks Animation) and Jennifer Yuh (2 ""KFP"") create a fun and interesting story where the legacy made previously is not sacrificed, instead they emphasize more the possibilities that has the franchise for a fourth part. The history of parents is loaded with funny jokes, but its main function is to generate the dramatic counterpart in the film. Therefore the central story is well established and the moments of action and adventure are excellently executed, illustrated as a masterpiece of animation.""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is clearly just fun. Perhaps it feel as a part that was unnecessary to do, since this franchise not weaves the story of its characters as Disney's sagas, Dreamworks recreates different stories in his films, a double-edged weapon. ""KFP 3"" has not the load dramatic that had ""Toy Story 3""or ""Monsters, Inc"" but its brightness and comicality both visual and auditory create a nice film and that truly breaks expectations."
162,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,16 March 2016,A one time watch ! worth the money!!!,"The movie was all about emotions and knowing about your true self and that was heartwarming!I just loved the story and the animation. Kudos DreamWorks!! There are some things about the movie which were a letdown for me though. Personally, I expected it to be a laugh riot like the previous two parts. This one was focused on story a little more than its prequels and less on comedy and humour.Also, most of the humour shown in the movie was almost all of what was shown in the trailers of the movie.Coming to the trailers, they were a little too revealing. After every few minutes in the movie you are like, ""Oh! Okay, I knew that was coming because I saw that in the trailer.""The characters in the movie developed as the movie progressed. We get to know more about Po, his dad and his dad! (okay his dad- the goose until he revealed it to his son in Kung Fu Panda 2 and his genetic dad). We also learn a lot about Master Shifu and his humility and calmness and the true spirit of a master!This being the third part of the trilogy was well wrapped up! Po is a success and brings peace to the valley. We also get the clarity of why Grand Master Oogway made Po the Dragon warrior.There were very few loopholes in the story as well and overall was a good watch.A definite one time watch!"
163,Kung Fu Panda 3,9,14 March 2016,An enjoyable prequel to the Kung Fu Panda series,"I can recall seeing the first Kung Fu Panda movie a few years ago yet I haven't seen the second one as I passed on that,but yesterday my brother,my mom and myself all went to see this in 3D yesterday....so was it worth the wait?The film tells the tale of Po(Jack Black)who is shocked to discover that his long lost father(Bryan Cranston) is still alive and warns Po that Kai(J.K Simmons)is still alive having come back down to earth to finish off business. So its up to Po and the gang(Furious 5)to stop Kai before he turns them all into slaves for himself. The animation is beautiful and the 3D effects is worth seeing as you think the charcthers are sitting down next to you and the effects are coming out of the big screen. The animation is flawless and the message has been done so many times before in fact I notice in a lot of animated movies nowadays that its all about acceptance and believing in yourself and not to be negative on yourself either. Now you know from my past reviews that I am a huge fan of animation as I grew up with Disney and DreamWorks so yeah I really enjoyed this film and the voice cast was very good,Jack Black is very witty and has this cool hipster vibe to his persona. Also starring Kate Hudson as the ribbon panda who helps Po defeat Kai.My rating is a A-9/10"
164,Kung Fu Panda 3,8,14 March 2016,Same Formulaic Plot but Still Funny,"Our beloved and adorable Po is most welcomed to return in this ridiculous, playful yet beautiful third installment. The entire animation has exactly the same formulaic plot as the previous two episodes - a villain comes out of no where, the journey in preparing to fight and at the end only the main character can take down the big bad fella; adding on a whole bunch of cheesy moments but it is hilarious and entertaining thanks to Jack Black's well commitment. The Kung Fu adventure is absolutely beautiful and impressive, thanks to the stunning visual effects which heavily covers the Chinese cultures, settings and backgrounds; also the scores by Hans Zimmer who perfectly composes by mixing every single Western tracks with Chinese musical instruments. This family-friendly adventure might be fun without any great moral values as in Disney and Pixar animations but the reunion of this chubby panda with his biological father and the conflict with the adapted parent does generate some important messages that is worth to learn."
165,Kung Fu Panda 3,7,11 March 2016,Dramatic Exit,"""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is an enjoyable film, if you look at it in a kid's perspective. However it isn't on par with the hilarious and recurring themes of the first one or the dark and emotional impact of the second one. Right off the bat this film is beautifully animated, it has an intriguing premise and lots of potential especially with it's villain, but it did not deliver what it could've been because of its 1 hour and 25 minute run time which makes the film rushed and not fleshed out.First of all, this movie is an undeniably well animated film, each character looks more and more layered out and textured. The background and the foreground both look captivating and unique which gives the whole film its distinct look from the previous films. The film also offers a brilliant soundtrack once again from Hans Zimmer which elevates the story and giving a distinct feel for each character. The dynamic between Po and his Dad was also enjoyable considering a lot of kids will be watching this with their dads or their parents, it was handled pretty well. The Furious Five were also given some more lines to compensate for and they had more scenes compared to the previous film which was nice to see. HOWEVER, these saving graces don't really make the film that great. The flaws of this film are what really prevents this film from being better than what it is. The villain (Kai) was not fleshed out as much and there was a lot of potential for him even though granted it was given a great talent with J.K. Simmons which was a pretty good performance overall. Compared to previous villains like Tai Lung or Lord Shen, they were really fleshed out and unforgettable (personal favorite being Lord Shen) and they had an impact on Po, be it because of his master or because of his past. In this one, the motives that were set for the villain was rather simplistic and the exposition for him being quite powerful was promising and COULD'VE been his saving grace, but as the film progressed he DID show he was powerful but it felt like there was more to him and he felt quite underwhelming. Another flaw would be Po's journey, and this time he has to teach, but before he has to teach...he needs to know who he really is? Didn't the previous film already tackle this and more so even better than this film. The second film had such depth and development for Po's character as he later discovers his past and him learning that he didn't have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make him who his and that it is the rest of his story and who he chooses to be, and at the end of that emotional scene in KFP2 after he finds the truth, he tells himself ""I am Po"". Now we're back to square one here in KFP3, because he once again asks who he really is as a Panda, but doesn't that then negate what they built in the previous film??? That he is what he chooses to be? This was kind of repetitive to watch because it felt rushed and isn't as fleshed out as the second film. Moreover the film is really really convenient, there are times where (especially in the finale) unexpected deus ex machinas literally save the whole day and there are a lot of plot conveniences that are really predictable. The film also suffers from a lack of depth compared to the previous films except for some parts with Po and his Father but then again those scenes do get their emotional impact from Kung Fu Panda 2 which was kind of repetitive and too dependent on being reminiscent of the other films.In the end, Kung Fu Panda 3 is still a pretty enjoyable and fun film with your family if you disregard its flaws and look at the beauty it actually holds with its animation, the spirit of family and the feeling if you watch it feeling like a child. Verdict: 7.2/10"
166,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,10 March 2016,More Kung Fu fighting,"Jack Black is back voicing Po, the happy go lucky panda who is content to be the Dragon Warrior and come to save the village when required.Po still relies on the sage-like wisdom of Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), but Po has now been given responsibility as a teacher which he is at first ill equipped to be.When an evil spirit warrior Kai (JK Simmons) starts to dispatch all the other kung fu masters in China by stealing their chi (energy force.) Master Shifu sends his other kung fu warriors to confront him as Po found his long lost father and returned to the Panda village where Po also gets the interest of a ribbon dancing seductress called Mei Mei.Once Po realises that he must fight the spirit warrior he needs to train the Panda village with kung fu and master his chi in order to take on Kai.Also in the film are the rest of the gang helping Po out; Tigress, Mantis, Viper, Crane and Monkey.The film was partly made in China and some of the animation is very good and you can see great care and skill has been utilised in this cartoon. Also as the third film in the franchise, the story is solid with an interesting storyline that move the characters along and Po still has to take on new challenges to discover more about himself.The film is fun, frenetic, cheesy and kids will certainly be engrossed by it."
167,Kung Fu Panda 3,,10 March 2016,A funny and entertaining adventure with a positive message,"This film tells the story of Po the panda being chosen to be the teacher of Kung Fu. He also becomes the dragon warrior and tries hard to save the day despite his apparent shortcomings.I didn't quite like the previous two ""Kung Fu Panda"" films, as I find them silly. This one, however, is thoroughly entertaining with many funny jokes. It also emanates positivity, encouraging people to be confident in oneself. It is uplifting, cheering me up with a delightful adventure. I also like the many Chinese themes, such as imagery and music, being incorporated into the film. I enjoyed it and am actually hoping that there will be a sequel."
168,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,6 March 2016,incredible,What can be said about KFP that has not already been said.Great storyline and great characters ..brings east and west together and keeps up the fun but never gets too clever .Brilliant for young and old with a perfect mix of humour and action this is the best of the 3...at one point you almost forget this is a cartoon.The thing that pulls this away is the effects and animation. Any director worth his salt can put you into the action and bring you into the movie..but the animation in this is truly astonishing...I implore you to see this in 3D because believe me this is like nothing you have witnessed before...this is what movies are made for...an incredible 95 minutes. As a seasoned movie addict of 40 years I reckon that the action sequences through animation in this equal Life Of Pi and Avatar...just mouth openeingly incredible....perfect family movie which if opened a few months ago would have been Oscar nominated for animation.Plz Plz Plz spend an extra few pennies and catch with your kids in 3d.
169,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,5 March 2016,Po reunites with his father and takes on a special mission.,"This is the third installment of the KUNG FU PANDA franchise. Beautifully filmed and directed by Alessandro Caloni and Jennifer Yuh. Brilliant coloring in a stunning and very affecting Asian style. And of course, Jack Black is back as the dumpling craving Po, who had to go against tough odds to become a Dragon Warrior. The story is written by Jonathan Aiebel and Glenn Berger, and is sure to please the whole family from toddler to grandparents(who probably are in charge of the primary viewers of this fun fest).The story does have a few rare slow spots, but gets sentimental when Po reunites with his panda father, Li (Bryan Cranston). Po is whisked off to a secret happy place to learn the ways of young pandas. The plots thickens when Po finds out that a wicked villain Kai (J.K. Simmons) has been marauding China stealing the life force from kung fu masters. Po will take a gut check and decide to teach the small cuddly pandas the way of kung fu fighting. Thus the bumbling little warriors led by Po will seek out to defeat Kai and return the chi to the valley's kung fu masters.There is a great lineup of talented actors lending their voices: Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Kate Hudson, Wayne Knight, Seth Rogen and Luci Liu."
170,Kung Fu Panda 3,6,4 March 2016,Kung Fu Panda 3 Best Animation Movie,"""Kung Fu Panda"" franchise is one of the most successful movies of all- time, and I'd like to believe that that reason is because the writers, directors, producers and the creative animation talents behind it know how to solidly move the story forward, even with the same characters, they know how to make them evolve without losing the charm and the heart that made more than first and the second film effective. Kung Fu Panda 3 animation is sharp and beautiful with awesome quality. The action sequences are fun and entertaining. It is simply awesome! And it's so cool if you think about it, this is an animated family entertainment film franchise that gets more and more solid with every time, and that's always success of Kung Fu Panda franchise."
171,Kung Fu Panda 3,,28 January 2016,The addition of pseudo-love-interest Mei Mei (Kate Hudson) and comedy relief background pandas generate a hint of fresh humor.,"When master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) announces his retirement from teaching kung fu, no one is more shocked than portly ""Dragon Warrior"" panda Po (Jack Black)  who also discovers that the responsibility of the instructor will be passed on to him. And after a disastrous first day at the dojo, Po realizes he must search within himself to find the courage to lead. When ferocious soldier General Kai (J.K. Simmons) returns from banishment in the spirit world to take revenge on Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) and the guardians of the Jade Palace, it's up to Po, the Furious Five (Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and David Cross), and a long lost member of Po's family to band together to thwart this grave new threat.The breakneck pacing is back - the screen is ablaze with flurries of neon colors and bursts of kung-fu action jumbled together in brilliant special effects extravagance. But the creativity has waned considerably, as if the filmmakers have run out of ideas for Po and crew. It's already the third outing, so it's understandable that many of the basic themes have been exhausted, particularly when it comes to courage, sacrifice, honor, and being comfortable with (or understanding) oneself. But much of the heart, and certainly the amusement of the unlikely warrior engaging in underdog battles, has nearly disappeared, content instead with onslaughts of verbal jokes and visual gags to gloss over the thinness in plot. Plus, magic is used more often than not to provide solutions for unsolvable (or deadly) predicaments.There's very little time allotted for catching up with the characters; ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" definitely assumes that audiences are familiar with the former chapters. Beginning immediately with the spirit realm, a chi-collecting maniac, and the soul of dead master Oogway, it's evident that origins are of nominal use  and that gravity-defying wireworks choreography appears better suited to animation, even when the technique is intended to mimic live-action pictures. New roles are added every few minutes, stuffing the production with so many parts that supporting players like Liu's Viper and Chan's Monkey receive approximately 2-3 lines in the entire film. Fortunately, the addition of pseudo-love-interest Mei Mei (Kate Hudson) and comedy relief background pandas generate a hint of fresh humor.Visually, everything continues to advance in sharpness and movement and flashiness. Props, environments, and costumes look more realistic than ever. And augmenting this are momentary shifts in animation style, which are quickly becoming the norm in animated features. Subplots or backstories take on a two-dimensional look or colors morph into flat silhouettes to break up the supposed monotony of cartoony characters inhabiting stunningly realistic settings. But it's just another unnecessary device used to mask the lack of newness in Po's latest adventure. Rather than learning profound lessons in inner peace or balancing the forces of chi, Po seems to do a lot of frolicking in his Chinese village - before engaging in merriment in the panda retreat and lightheartedly cavorting with unexplained magic to thwart the advances of the deathly serious Kai.The Massie Twins"
