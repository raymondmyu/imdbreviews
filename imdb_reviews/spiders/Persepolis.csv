0,Persepolis,,2 December 2007,Not your average animated feature...,"...in fact, there is nothing average about this film. Traditionally animated in black and white flashbacks, it tells the story of a French-speaking woman's childhood and young adulthood in Tehran, Iran, and in Vienna during the 1980s and '90s.Marjane Satrapi grew up in a family of revolutionaries against the Shah's regime and the Islamic government that subsequently took hold, and the film literally illustrates her feelings and thought processes as a little girl, following her as the government control in Iran got more and more strict. When her parents insist she leave the country, we also see her struggling to deal with adolescence and missing her beloved family; when she returns, she is also coping with the increasing repression of her freedoms as a woman. Most of all, you see her own personal conflict as she tries to stay true to herself.This movie beautifully balances both the historic and personal issues and pulls the threads together into a compelling narrative, made a bit quirky by the style of presentation, resulting in work that is altogether touching. Along with intelligence and humor, a deep and strong sense of truth infuses every part of this film, making it even stronger. One of my only qualms was the feeling that it ended somewhat abruptly without much of a conclusion.Overall, though, it was fantastic - definitely worth watching."
1,Persepolis,8,3 July 2007,"Animation in black-and-white, autobiographical, growing up in Iran during the reign of the Shah and later, the Islamists","The black-and-white animation, highly stylized and two dimensions which doesn't attempt to render the usual cartoon 3-D, summarizes in quick, intelligent flashes, often impressionistic, growing up in Teheran and Vienna from a highly personal point of view. The narrative is as original as the art. The narrator, Marjane Satrapi, only daughter of an educated Teheran couple, first sketches in briefly how the Shah first came to power,only to lose it and have it replaced by the fanatical religious regime of today. Educated in a French school, she and her family are rapidly alienated from the so-called revolution; she is sent to Vienna to continue her education, falls in with a group of punks and eventually returns both depressed and disillusioned to Teheran where, with other university students, she must submit to the rule of extreme Islamists.The story covers a great deal of ground from the point of view of a young pro-Western culture radical, and is told with humor and intelligence. She laughs at herself as much as at the semi-lunatic Guards of the Revolution.Satrapi's hold on reality is much strengthened under the influence of her highly honest grandmother who teaches her not co compromise, not to betray and not to give in.This is no fairy tale with flying horses and beautiful princesses, but a serious, unsentimental and sometimes brutally honest film covering, among other events, the story of the millions of Iranians and Iraqis who died in a now forgotten seven year war around the Persian Gulf."
2,Persepolis,8,19 August 2007,A very personal yet universal account of the Iranian revolution,"I came out of this movie feeling as if I knew Marjane Satrapi. The way in which the story is told is fantastic - it really is as if you're reading her journal. As she grows up from being a young girl to an adult, at each age the story is told with a corresponding maturity, and highlighting things which seem like very personal memories. As a young girl, the stories she is told are very black and white, and as she gets older the complexity increases, which is exactly what you would expect. Although there is lots of political activity, she makes fun of herself and highlights her own shortcomings as much as she highlights the repressive elements in her homeland. By telling of her own experiences it really is extremely easy to see how so much of it is common to a whole generation of Iranians. Her love of her family and her country came across very strongly, and you really felt as if she had laid herself bare. A moving and entertaining movie as much as it is educational about post-1979 Iran."
3,Persepolis,9,19 January 2008,the book is a fuller experience,"I rated this film a 9 more as a visual complement to the comic book (of two volumes, now bound as one), which I believe to be a masterpiece. If you left the film less than emotionally attached to the characters, PLEASE give the book a chance, because, as is often the case, episodes and histories of a lot of the characters, including Marjane, are left out to adapt the story to a film medium. Having said that, there are great sequences, expressionistic animation, and the wiseass grandma is left fully intact from the books! I can understand why some people weren't emotionally compelled by it though, since the movie doesn't take the time to fill the audience in on all the quirkiness and endearing qualities of the characters as Satrapi originally conceived them."
4,Persepolis,9,26 January 2008,A wonderful told story with a unique style,"Persepolis tells the amazing story of a young girl growing up in Iran around the time of the Islamic Revolution. Marjane Satrapi does a wonderful job of bringing her story to life and drawing the viewer into her what it was to grow up during a time of political revolution. Using a unique style of animation, that closely follows the style of the graphic novel, the audience is pulled into a world that is much different than the world they are used to.Marjane's story is often times humorous and often times heart breaking without resorting to heavy handed sentimentalism that is often seen in Hollywood movies. There were times that I laughed out loud during the movie, particularly the ""Eye of the Tiger"" sequence which had me in stitches. Other times during the film I had to wipe a tear from my eye. I won't spoil any of those moments for anyone, but there were parts of the film that left me crushed.The characters in the story were all very interesting and all seemed very real. I loved watching Marjane grow from a child to an adult and seeing how she dealt with struggles as extreme as a revolution and as simple as the end of a relationship. Most of the supporting characters were interesting as well and extremely well thought out. The most memorable of the side characters though, would have to be Marjane's grandmother. She almost acted as Marjane's moral compass throughout the film and in most cases she did it with a great cynicism and humor that only someone who has lived through so much could have.As an American I will probably never know what it is like to live in a state of such political oppression as the one depicted in the film. It is an extremely hard thing to even imagine what people go through during such political struggles. However, one of the things that makes this movie unique is that a lot of it is told from the point of view of a child that does not really understand the politics of what is going on around her. This really helped draw me into the movie. Since I do not understand what it is like to be in the situation, having the story told from the point of view of someone that doesn't really grasp the enormity of the events unfolding around her really helped to bring me into the story. It was very helpful in trying to comprehend the scale of what was happening in the movie, not that I claim to totally comprehend what this young girl must have gone through.The animation style of the film is definitely interesting and unique. It is a lot different than anything I have seen before and I really enjoyed the style that was used. The more simplistic animation that was used definitely worked well with the story being told from the point of view of a child. The child in the story could not totally grasp all the details of what was going on during the revolution and having a less detailed style of animation definitely helped emphasize this. Also, having a style of animation that was so different than what audience are used to also helped emphasize that we were viewing a world that was, in many ways, much different than our own.Overall I really enjoyed the film and it is one that I may eventually want to see again. I really would like to read the graphic novels that it was based on and probably even a few of the other graphic novels written by Marjane Satrapi. I think she is a wonderful talent and I hope she continues to make such interesting films, perhaps bringing some of her other graphic novels to the big screen."
5,Persepolis,10,31 December 2007,A whole new kind of animation,"Persepolis is one of the most thoughtful, poignant and original films I have ever seen. Hang on, ""poignant"" and ""thoughful"", an animated movie (and based on a comic-book, on top of that)? Exactly, because coincidentally Persepolis also happens to be the first really adult ""cartoon"" I've had the pleasure to watch (Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly don't count, as they were filmed with real actors first, and subsequently modified in post-production). For all their good intentions, the likes of Dreamworks and Pixar always have an eye for what the little ones want to see, while The Simpsons, despite the occasional ""mature"" storyline (basically Homer and Marge's sex life), contains nothing a 12-year old isn't supposed to see. As for Family Guy and South Park, they might be aimed at grown-ups with their merciless satire and, in the case of the latter series, explicit language, but are made with an almost puerile sense of joy which prompts younger kids to watch them in secret. Persepolis, on the other hand, deals with adult themes in a serious, unpretentious way. So yes, it is an animated film. Yes, it is based on a comic-book. And yes, there is the occasional neat movie reference (Rocky III being the most memorable one). That doesn't mean it's a kids' movie, though; it just means the picture was made with a particular style because it was the most effective way to tell this specific story.And what is so special about the story? Well, it is an account of what is going on in contemporary Iran, a topic that is more relevant today than it's ever been before. And the extra layer of poignancy derives from the fact that co-director Marjane Satrapi experienced every single event in the film. After moving to France to avoid the increasingly oppressive political situation that had developed in Teheran (which the ancient Greeks called Persepolis, hence the movie's title), she published her autobiography in the form of a graphic novel, which immediately became a cult phenomenon. With the help of artist Vincent Paronnaud, the stylized drawings have become a motion picture which has already conquered critics and won several awards (the Jury Prize in Cannes being one of them).The film's strict adherence to the book's style makes for simple but powerful viewing: the simple pictures ensure the story doesn't need to be filtered, but can be understood right away, while the use of black and white provide the images with a strength that would otherwise be missing. A good example is a scene depicting a demonstration against the despotic regime in Iran and the subsequent shooting of one of the protesters, whose body is left lying on the ground: as his blood starts to flow, the corpse almost merges with the environment, giving the shot (pun not intended) an emotional relevance it wouldn't have, had the whole thing been in color. The choice of animation proves to be particularly effective in a most unusual choice for this kind of film, namely fantasy sequences: there is a hilarious moment, for instance, when Marjane, during a stay in Vienna, looks back on her disappointment in love and sees her ex-boyfriend as a depraved freak; live-action would have ruined that scene, undoubtedly. As it is, however, it comes off not as a bizarre formal experiment, but a fundamental tool for understanding the heroine's psychology.That said, it should also be noted that Persepolis isn't just a bold take on the difficulties in the Middle East. As seen in Clint Eastwoood's Iwo Jima double bill, the line between ""heroes"" and ""villains"" is very thin, and the film never misses the opportunity to show how bad our own society can be: Marjane ends up hating Europe more than her home-country, and at the beginning a flashback shows the British government's role in manipulating Iranian politics for money's sake. Incidentally, the latter scene is depicted as a puppet show, providing a new, fresh angle: what sets truth apart from fiction?Persepolis works because it handles an uncomfortable subject with grace, using a simple but constantly effective storytelling technique and never once pandering to audience expectations with the usual 'toon gimmicks (even the casting proves that: except for Catherine Deneuve, who plays the low-key role of Marjane's mother, there are no famous voices in the feature). It sticks to traditions and stretches the medium at the same time, showing that animation is no longer a ""children's genre"" and therefore delivering a new way to look at film-making and its possibilities. For this reason, and several more, it is one of the best pictures of 2007."
6,Persepolis,8,4 April 2010,The Contemporary History of Iran,"In 1978, in Iran, the smart girl Marjane Satrapi lives the troubled period of the history of her country with the Islamic Revolution with her ideologist parents and grandmother. When she is a teenager, her parents send her to Vienna due to the war with Iraq. Marjane befriends a group of outcast students, finds love and deception and returns to her country to the arms of her family. However, the life with the fundamentalist in the government is repressive and she leaves her country again to live in France.""Persepolis"" is an interesting animation where the contemporary history of Iran is disclosed through the eyes of the lead character. This feature gives a great lesson of history highlighting the most important moments of the life of Iranian in their country. This dramatic animation has many levels but is highly recommended for adults and offers excellent dialogs and messages. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Persépolis"""
7,Persepolis,8,11 October 2007,"Festival film, celebrated in France, now an Oscar contender?","Iranian expatriate Marjane Satrapi's 'Persepolis' graphic novel series (2000-2003) recounts her life to age 24, when she left Iran with her family's blessing for the last time and went to live in France (1994). Collaborating with her Paris studio-mate, cartoonist and video artist Vincent Paronnaud and a stellar French cast, Sagtrapi has successfully transferred her drawings and story to a 95-minute black-and-white animated film. Chiara Mastroianni is the voice for the adolescent and young adult Marjane; Chiara's real-life mother Catherine Deneuve does Marjane's mother and veteran French star Danielle Darrieux is the voice of Marjane's feisty, outspoken, and totally irreverent grandmother. (An English-language version featuring Sean Penn, Iggy Pop, and Gena Rowlands apparently will be released later.) Word on the street is that this more handmade French animated film, now in selected US theaters, may give Pixar's slick 'Ratatouille' a run for the Best Animation Oscar this year.Satrapi, who told this story first in autobiographical comic strips that became best-selling books, grew up in a progressive ruling-class Tehran family. An uncle with whom she was close had been to Leningrad to study Marxism-Leninism. As a little girl she picked up the radicalism, and had some of her grandmother's genes for outspokenness. Shifting allegiances and roles quickly, she soon gave up supporting the Shah and walked around the house calling for revolution. She tried on ideas constantly, posing as a prophet, then a dictator. God and Karl Marx, whom she imagines appearing to her in her bedroom, vie with each other for her affections. Her communist uncle is hopeful that the revolution will grow democratic; but while he is imprisoned and tortured by CIA-trained jailers under the Shah, he is executed under the mullahswhom, strangely, the narrator says little about. (Khomeini is not depicted.) All the girls must take the veil. But Marji, already an avid collector of bootleg heavy metal and punk tapes, remains an obstreperous girl who in class outspokenly challenges the pious lies of her chador-wearing teachers.Iran's war with Iraq causes terrible disruption: the house next door is destroyed. For her safety in this desperate moment for the country (1983), Marji's parents send her to Vienna, where she attends a French school, as she has all her life. Though she eventually becomes part of a group of misfit students, Vienna is a hard and lonely time for the girl. She grows up physically (which happens in seconds in the animationthe film's most eye-catching sequence) and enters love problems: first with a boy who turns out to be gay; then one who sleeps with another girla betrayal that makes her so despondent she becomes homeless and ill and almost dies. She returns to an Iran where the upper class is living a double life of secret alcohol parties and music. Attending university in Tehran she meets a man named Reza and marries him--but the union is a mistake, which her grandmother cheerfully dismisses. ""The first marriage is just practice,"" she says. A bored, doodling psychiatrist listens to her troubles, tells her she's depressed, and gives her some pills--which seem to make her more depressed. Finally the time comes when Marjane is in effect ordered by her family to leave the country for her own good. She goes to France, where she has remained ever since. That's the end of the book and the film. Art Spiegelman's Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel 'Maus' was an avowed inspiration for Satrapi's work, as well as a French comics artist named David B., whose style she imitated at first. The collaboration with Paronnaud came about after they shared a studio.The animated 'Persepolis' received rave reviews in France and shared the Cannes festival Jury Prize with Carlos Reygadas' 'Silent Light.' It premiered in the US at the New York Film Festival and opened in some US theaters on Christmas Day.The US's newly hostile stand against Iran may spur wider Stateside interest in this film, which skillfully combines a young woman's coming of age story with contemporary political history. This remains, however, basically a child's and young adult's version of events, a kind of post-1970 'Iranian History for Dummies.' The viewpoint has obvious limitations as a depiction of the larger events that are so much a part of the story Satrapi tells. The film moreover adds little that wasn't in the book other than a little more gray cross-hatching and in fact omits some day-to-day detail that make the original version specific. The film's look too remains as bare-bones, as virtually style-neutral as the book's. This is not to say 'Persepolis' hasn't complete technical integrity, clarity of storytelling, and much charm; nonetheless viewers in search of a phantasmogoric visual banquet or a thoroughgoing picture of modern Iranian history may be left hungry for more."
8,Persepolis,7,13 August 2007,A life in cartoons.,"It's quite unusual for a writer to adapt its own book to the screen, especially when it's a comic-book (well, Frank Miller's done it, but that's another story), and especially when it's an autobiographical comic book. That's the originality of this movie, which is the adaptation of a autobiographical graphic novel by its very author. ""Persepolis"" deals with the life, and especially the youth of Marjane Satrapi, in Iran, during the reign of the Shah and the Islamic revolution. But if the memories could be easily told alone in front of a blank paper, isn't it harder to be true and sincere when you are surrounded by a all animation crew ?That's the great achievement of the movie : to be true to the comics and therefor, to the life of Marjane. The best parts of it are all about her personal relations, with her grandmother or her uncle. You really have the feeling that she relates all this events to praise their memories and who they were. On the other side, the political scenes and historical point of view that supposedly are the goal of the movie seem to me a little less good than the family or personal souvenirs. It may be true but it seems a little bit simple and even cliché sometimes (see for instance the history of the Shah for all audiences). The personal view on the repercussion of the Islamic repression is way better than this kind of big exposes. The death of a young man trying to escape the police after a party or the attitude of a man insulting her mother in a parking tells us more about the regime in Iran than the speech the movie sometimes (but not so often) gives us.So, paradoxically, the more personal the movie gets, the truer it is. The all rapport the difficulties to left your country and to adapt to another world seems for instance very honest and touching. The childhood period, told in a comic strip style is both funny and melancholic. In the end, this movie is far from being a movie about Iran, but only tells an individual life, crying for freedom in a country were a woman can't reach it, but transfigured by personal memories and a strong animated point of view, that uses all the techniques and styles a comic-book adaptation could offer."
9,Persepolis,10,27 December 2007,One of the best films of 2007,"This is a marvelous film. The voice actors in French are superb; I'm not sure whether it will translate in an English dub. The animation is charming; you forget that it's mostly black and white, and remember only how beautiful it is. It is both bleak and hilarious, chilling and human. The ""Eye Of The Tiger"" scene is awesome for being so amateurishly sung in heavily accented English and only just in key. I learned a great deal about modern Iranian history, and relived a great deal of childhood and adolescence (albeit not in a sophomoric way).I saw it at a free screening with about 6 other people before it was released, but I will be paying to see it again and dragging as many people as I can to see it with me. If you're reading this, I'd drag you to see it, too. It's a GREAT film, one that deserves all the awards it can garner, and not just as an animated film, but as a brilliant movie that just happens to be animated."
10,Persepolis,8,1 March 2008,Intellectual and funny autobiographical animation. One of a kind,"Marjane Satrapi's venture to present the chronicle of the Iranian Islamic revolution filtered through the eyes of a lively and cheeky, French-educated young girl is bold and ambitious. To do so by the help of strong-silhouetted, axe-carved, triangle-nosed cartoon figures is even more peculiar. Her powerful heroine  Marjane, named by no coincidence after the creator  however, spectacularly succeeds in replacing and emulating any possible real flesh characters. She is intellectual, witty, utterly impudent and very funny; the essential Euro-kid of the wild and untamed 1970s and early 1980s.This brilliant movie serves as a study proving that animation is more powerful and potent than ever before no matter how unsophisticated and basic the visual elements are. And although the technique used in Persepolis has long been present it can be said that perfection has just been achieved.Satrapi's work is so very French: wantonly intellectual, acrimoniously witty, utterly sarcastic and outrageously funny. However, even this masterpiece could not escape common places and is not without disturbing occurrences of generalization of characters and situations. Still, you will have a wide and genuine smile on your face coming out of the theater. Persepolis is per se unique and compelling with the ability to make you smile at the right moments - when tension has built up too much."
11,Persepolis,9,20 December 2007,very good adaption !,"Adapting ""Persepolis"" in my opinion was a very important project. Especially (but not only) during times of fear and extreme distrust regarding other ethnicities it's necessary to communicate better understanding for these cultures. Films are capable reach millions of people all around the world. Therefore this medium is a very effective way to do this (unfortunately it can also get misused in the opposite direction).Seen from this cultural perspective ""Persepolis"" is an entertaining feature which also meets a certain social responsibility. To me it is the right picture at the right time. In a individually visualized way this animation picture shows Marjane Satrapis personal biography and gives you an idea about the historical background of the Iran and the way of living in this part of the world. Besides several tragic moments ""Persepolis"" never loses it's humour.In a short: ""Persepolis"" is a very true and affectionate adaption of the original comic also drawn by Satrapi who directed the film. An important issue and not only for this reason I truly recommend it !"
12,Persepolis,,4 January 2008,PERSEPOLIS - Animated film of the Year?,"I've been curious about the PERSEPOLIS ever since it won a jury prize in Cannes this spring. The buzz was strong, and it's won (or been nominated for) numerous prizes since then. It's an Animated film, which rarely get taken seriously in non-Animated categories. It's even France's official entry for the Academy Awards (THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY was disqualified because it wasn't 'French' enough for the Oscars). Could it be that good? Yes.I love RATATOUILLE, but PERSEPOLIS is a tremendously affecting film. It tells the autobiographical story of Marjane Satrapi an Iranian woman who left her native Iran for France. First done as a Graphic Novel, Satrapi co-directed this simply rendered animation film in collaboration with Vincent Parranoud. Most of it is in Black & White. It may take some getting used to for folks weened on CGI (or big budget 'traditional' animation), but it serves the story impeccably.There have been other graphic novels that have used Animation (in addition to numerous live action adaptations such as Cronenberg's HISTORY OF VIOLENCE), but PERSEPOLIS finds a way to present its tale on film in a way I've never seen before. There are lots of short scenes, it takes place over a number of years, and covers a lot of physical and emotional territory. All of these would have been foreboding for a live action film, but the simple (but beautiful) animation isn't just a compromise - it's a revelation. A ten second still drawing here conveys what a full 2 or 3 minute live action scene might struggle to achieve.The story covers the era from the fall of the Shah of Iran to (roughly) the mid-90's. The hoped for freedom of the post-Shah regime ends up in an even more repressive Muslim government. This sounds grim, and much of it is. Hopefully, PERSEPOLIS will also educate folks that Iran has a long history of being one of the more educated and culturally aware nations in the Middle East. Pop culture references to Arnuld, Michael Jackson, Abba and, most amusingly, Godzilla (Toho even gets a thank you in the credits!) will resonate with Western audiences, but they serve a purpose in the story. Hopefully, that message will out in the country as well."
13,Persepolis,7,24 February 2008,Heart wrenching tale succeeds through black and white surreal animation,"*Contains semi-spoilers: Summarizes part of the plot*Based on Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel of the same name, ""Persepolis"" is an animated autobiographical film that tells the story of a young Marjane growing up during the turmoil of the Iranian Revolutionary War in the early '80's and '90s. The animation is mostly in black and white, and uses abstract drawings and surreal imagery throughout. The film is in French with English subtitles.The story begins with a young nine-year old Marjane. She is precocious and outspoken yet does not realize the reality of the Iran/Iraq conflict taking place outside her bedroom window. The Iran we see is the Iran viewed through naïve eyes  we witness Marjane's love for fashion and punk music, we see she and her friends teasing boys on the playground, and we view her playing in the snow in the winter. These images are beautiful and filled with sentimentality. Then, her world changes when her beloved uncle is executed and Iraqi bombs destroy her neighborhood. As the conflict in Iran begins to show its gravity, she becomes more aware of the importance of pride for her homeland. As she gets older, her parents worry about her outspokenness, as she protests the war in school and in other public places. During this time, any person caught denying the Iranian government, and any woman not wearing her veil, could be executed. When she is fourteen, her parents decide to protect her by sending her to a French school in Austria where she can receive a proper education free of oppression. She must endure the typical ordeals of a teenager, but must do so alone in a strange land. After a few years, she becomes too homesick and returns to Iran, where her friends and family have noticed an obvious change in her.Although heart wrenching and sad, ""Persepolis"" succeeds because the audience can detach themselves to a certain extent knowing they are watching a cartoon, even if it's based on Satrapi's true story; the graphics are abstract enough that the audience can relate to them and still be able to get through her painful tale of war, death, destruction, and heartbreak. Running at just 95 minutes, each scene leaves a whirlwind of emotions and then ends without really clearing up any conflicts. We know Satrapi prevails because we know she has created this film, but we do not know how she got to where she is today; we have to just trust her strong-willed, empowering character present through every stage of her life in the film and believe that she can overcome any barrier in her way.Although the narrator in the film tells the story through a series of flashbacks, it's easy to follow. What was more difficult, however, was understanding exactly what was happening in Iran as the film progressed. I suggest ""googling"" the Iranian Revolutionary War before seeing this film, because it was a complicated time that lasted nearly seven years and is more relevant today than it has ever been before.""Persepolis"" is moving, thoughtful, and painful throughout. I caught myself tearing up during the majority of the movie. Up for an Oscar for best-animated film, it might just give Disney's ""Ratatouille"" a run for its money."
14,Persepolis,,26 December 2007,"Good ""acting"" sometimes makes you forget that this is animation","This graphic-novel-adapted autobiographical story, which is also a brief history of Iran through the coming of age of a girl, is so well acted (drawn, I mean) that you sometimes forget that it is an animation.Through a flashback, we follow Marjane Satrapi's story from childhood, starting with an insightful exchange in which the little girl who aspires to becoming the greatest prophet tells her grandmother, in childlike innocence, that when she grows up, she wants to ensure that old women in Iran will not suffer. When asked how she is going to achieve it, she replied, in a matter-of-course way, ""It will simply not be allowed"".Educated parents and an emancipated grandmother who acts as her conscience are not enough guarantee a good life for a girl in a dictatorship that uses religion as an excuse to persecute dissidents. Three years abroad in Vienna only gives her a sense of alienation which, ironically, stayed with her after she comes home. Romance and wedlock soon turn into disillusionment. Finally, under urges from her beloved family that verge on pleads, she leaves Iran forever.Animation has the advantage of permitting a pace that allows a lot to be included into a simply and honestly told story, particularly in early childhood and adolescence. Quite thought-provoking is seeing how atrocities and cruelties (tortures, for example) are seen through little kids' eyes, particularly little kids growing up in an environment where these things are a normal part of life. There is also throughout the movie a sense of humour that is at times somewhat sarcastic. As a teenager looking for punk music in the black market, Marjane walks through a throng of peddlers trying to sell her an assortment of trendy videos, including ""Jichael Mackson""."
15,Persepolis,10,10 February 2008,"A grim, but captivating account of the human spirit","Persepolis is a lovingly,hand drawn animated feature film from France, that tells the story of a young girl growing up in Iran,the daughter of left wing revolutionary parents,during the Islamic revolution. It spans something like 13 years in her life, from childhood,adolescence to early adulthood. It was taken from a graphic novel,published in France. Most of the prints in circulation are the French language version, but there is an English dubbed version (I thankfully saw the original French version,with English subtitles). What I really admired was the carefully nuanced use of colour (most of the flashback sequences are in black & white). In an era that is now overblown with 3D computer generated animation, it's refreshing to see somebody kicking it old school style (hand drawn). This is a film that is worth seeking out."
16,Persepolis,5,5 January 2012,A good movie for children,"Interesting demographics from IMDb: the age group that rated this movie the highest is ""males under 18"" (8.6). That is an enlightening piece of data.In a nutshell the story is about an upper middle class girl in Teheran who grows up witnessing the political turbulence in 1970s Iran. That could make a good story, the problem is that ""witnessing"" may be too strong a word here, ""staring blankly"" would be closer to the mark. The protagonist does not seem to commit, care or even remotely understand any of the events around her and this applies to her at ALL ages depicted in the movie. It's flabbergasting to me how some reviewers could find her character engaging, while others go as far as praising her ""courage"". This is plain insulting to people who put their bodies on the line while the little spoiled brat just went to Vienna and Paris to drink, smoke and date as many dull and stupid guys as she could. And when she gets bored she goes back to Iran, because she loves her homeland so much (?). The expressionistic visuals are good, but certainly fail to convey the drama of the revolution, war, and other emotional events depicted in the movie, rather lending them a surreal feel that is not what it should be like for relatively recent historical events. No single character has any depth to them, and this is not due to the movie being an animation. With the exception of the uncle everyone's motivations are shallow and hedonistic, which is not what you would expect in such turbulent times.In a country of 75 million I'd bet my house that any random 40-year-old person you picked on the street would have a more interesting and engaging walk of life than the director/protagonist of this movie. But as the IMDb demographics show, if you are under 18, you'll probably like ""Persepolis"", learn some basics about a country called Iran and your 90 minutes will not be wasted."
17,Persepolis,5,28 September 2008,"Animation: Exquisite, a Ten. Character, Plot and Ideas: Zilch.","When ""Persepolis"" first made a big splash in the publishing world, I wondered why. So many good books go unpublished and unreadwhy so much buzz from a comic book about a girl living in Islamic Revolution Iran? Now that I've seen ""Persepolis,"" I know the answer. Marjane, the lead character, occupies a parallel socioeconomic slot to literary agents, editors, journalists and opinion makers. She's a privileged, sheltered girl who invests in nothing and smokes, drinks, and parties her way through life while others are out making sacrifices for what they believe. From her perch of assumed superiority, Marjane looks down on everyone except her doting parents and grandmother, lights another cigarette, pours another drink, and sneers. In Marjane's view, Catholic nuns who shelter wayward youth are equally as evil as Iranian Revolutionary guards who torture dissidents to death. Et voila. Cultural Relativism, the worldview that all those who do nothing for anyone claim as their religion.""Persepolis""'s animation is gorgeous, and worth seeing the movie for. It was inspired by German Expressionism. The animation is black and white and I'd sit through this tedious, annoying movie again just to view it. The DVD features fascinating extra features on the creation of animation.Other than the animation, there really isn't anything to see here. Marjane is the absolute center of everything. She's the center of the universe, really. Marjane Satrapy is a spoiled, sheltered girl, the descendant of Iranian royalty. ""Satrap"" is Persian for ""governor"" and English for ""a self-important official."" Marjane is a passive witness to life under the late, deposed Shah, and then to the Iranian Revolution, and then to teen decadence in Europe. Along the way, she drinks, she smokes, and she sleeps with all the wrong men. Other people, those not in her family, are ridiculous, ugly, and lead pointless lives. In Marjane's view. But Marjane's view is all you get. When she meets a new guy, he is drawn as very attractive. As Marjane inevitably, and in a way meant to be tragic, discovers that her latest lover is no good, he is drawn as physically unattractive. Marjane is surrounded by people who risk all for what they believe, from her communist uncle to the Revolutionary Guard. Marjane believes in nothing, and risks nothing. She just looks on and sniffs.A successful narrative requires a sympathetic main character and a coherent narrative. ""Persepolis"" has neither. Marjane's problem is not that she's such a passive, contemptuous person, but that she exercises no self awareness or critical capacity. She never takes a good hard look at herself or her country's circumstances. It is enough for her to depict others as ridiculously and blameworthy. The storyline is not coherent. The Shah, the Ayatollahs, a woman's dog in Vienna who misbehaves  all are passing shadows in Marjane's jaded vision. Nothing hangs together.Americans, British people, and Catholic nuns are responsible for all the problems in the world. Never, not once, does ""Persepolis"" so much as hint at the theory that maybe, just maybe, the once great Persian Empire was brought down by Islam, imported by force by less advanced Arabs, that mandates gender apartheid and jihad, both of which have devastated Iran under the ayatollahs. There are certainly Persians in exile who will tell you just that. Any work about modern Iran that never once interrogates what Islam is doing to that nation so rich in resources and currently so poor in fact is dropping the intellectual ball.One weird aspect of the film is its racism. None of the Iranian characters, including Marjane, look especially Iranian. Who does? The Revolutionary Guards. They are drawn with the prominent noses and heavy black hair common in the Middle East and Iran. Sympathetic characters have petite noses and less hair. Good grief."
18,Persepolis,,29 December 2008,An engagingly personal tale with an interesting background of history delivered with deceptively basic but very clever animation,"As a young woman, Majane reflects on her journey this far in life  a journey that has taken her to be an outsider living in Europe but one that she recalls starting as a nine year old girl in Tehran, Iran. Here she was an enthusiastic young girl raised in an intelligent and liberal family who were rebelling against those in power  at the expense of some of her family being held in prison. The celebrate when they appear to win the revolution but their hopes are dashed when fundamentalists take control, forcing strict controls on women and putting thousands of those who do not conform into prison. As a teenager, Marji continues to rebel but when her beloved Uncle Anouche is executed and the Iran/Iraq war begins, live becomes increasingly dangerous.It took me a minute to get around to seeing Persepolis because it just seemed to me that it would be a heavy, subject-driven film. It already had some camps lifting it on their shoulders and carrying it around the animation world, even as others were protesting and dismissing it as more anti-Iranian propaganda released as part of part of the US building the case for war (hmmm  a quick dip into the message boards reminds me why I generally stay off message boards!). I watched it recently on a flight on my DVD player and did get a few looks from those sitting next to me over what I imagine was their amusement at an adult watching a cartoon. I wasn't too fussed by this though because my attention was pretty much with the film.What the film did so well to engage me was tell a personal story but do it in a way that gave the bigger picture as well. Now I know that there will be those that just see this as being propaganda but for me I accept what I am being told as being the perspective of Satrapi. She is not making a documentary, she is telling things from her opinions  other opinions exist and these should be sought out rather than just deciding that one successful film means that these are the facts. That said, it is hard to disagree with her presentation of things here. It is at its most clumsy at the beginning, where the young Marji is told stories and introduced to her revolutionary Uncle; here it is a bit more ""big picture"" and less to do with her as a character, but this does get better and as Marji starts to grow and become more than a pair of eyes but a pair of eyes involved in the world beyond that of her parent's flat. In this shift the film becomes much more engaging as we follow essentially a teenager looking to have fun in this new world of restrictions and perhaps gender bias inherent in the extreme interpretation of her religion.The creation of the characters is important in making this part, and thus the bigger picture parts, of the film work as well as it did. This creation is down to the animation, the dialogue and the relative actions of the, well, relatives. In the latter two areas the writing keeps everything feeling realistic and convincing, making it easy to be drawn into the story and the lives on display. All those playing Marji deliver but of course for Benites this is mainly about being adorable, which she does. Mastroianni has more to do and she does it well. Thanks to the script she is presented warts and all and at times she is a spoilt and conflicted woman  putting some off no doubt but to me only making the film more engaging because it does feel quite honest in its self-reflection. Having her real life mother play her mother was a good bit of casting and does provide some chemistry and tension between the two characters that compliments their performances. All the voice work is good but what I found most appealing was the animation.Mostly delivered in black & white, without a lot of shading, the animation is deceptively blocky but produces engaging characters which are comic and touching. I particularly liked the way that the animation reflects the film being the memories of the teller, since we are seeing this film inside the head of the adult Marji. How this translates is that things are visually changed to reflect her viewers; so we have the two women challenging Marji being shown as snake-like in their bodies, when in love the city looks soft and the car floats Maji and her new boyfriend home while scenes of destruction are dark and imposing. It is a good way of animating because not only does it visually engage but ti also makes the material more meaningful as well.Persepolis is not an easy sell on the face of it but the reality is that it is a charming and really well delivered personal story that also plays out the modern history of Iran as a broad, inescapable backdrop to Marji's life (which of course it is). The animation is deceptively basic but used to compliment the telling and characters to good effect. As the makers have said  animation is not a genre but a medium and this animated film is a very good personal drama that has the ability to deliver is characters in a historical context."
19,Persepolis,5,16 September 2008,Generic coming-of-age story with gorgeous animation,"With its sassy female lead character, revolution-era setting, and themes of loneliness and exile, Persepolis has all the makings of a generic ""third world"" coming of age tale - the kind you can enjoy without any prior knowledge of the history of the country in question. In fact, this film is probably more enjoyable for those who have never heard of Iran before, as anyone who can tell the difference between a Shah and an Ayatollah will find the first half hour of the film didactic and plodding, as the ""conversations"" between characters are usually just melodramatic monologues.It's also frustrating that this is strictly a tale of upper-class suffering. The main character comes from a wealthy family and can apparently leave the country at will. She sympathizes with communism, but there isn't a poor person to be seen in the film - instead we're asked to sympathize with rich teens whose drunken parties are at risk of being raided by the religious police, and with the generic trials and tribulations of the main character - love, loss, exile, etc.The major redeeming feature is the animation, which is fantastic. It makes the film a worthwhile watch, if the story doesn't put you to sleep."
20,Persepolis,5,13 April 2008,Upper Middle Class Iranian Girl Finds Revolution Revolting,"Rather than a film exposing the tyranny of the imams - though there is a bit of that - Persepolis turned out to be the story of how official repression - whether by the Palevi Shahs or by the revolutionary imams - seriously disrupted the upper middle class life of an Iranian girl and her extended family. In other words, this is a gussied up ""coming of age"" film about a young Persian woman and the bumps she encounters along the way to womanhood. I don't doubt that it must have been extraordinarily difficult to be growing up at the time of the downfall of the Shah, followed by the horrendous Iran-Iraq war, and by the current dictatorship of the imams, but this film presents only the young woman's self-centered view of all that. It's hard be sympathetic to a character who is complaining that a hospital bureaucrat used to be her window washer, or sympathetic to a character who refuses to leave Iran for another country because he might wind up as a taxi driver. Besides being egregiously insulting to the window washers and taxi drivers of the world - tens of thousands of whom have in real life sacrificed professional status in their home countries in order to secure a better life for their families in a new country - the characters in this animation seem to be nothing more than decent people who are very put out at having to modify their formerly happy, middle class existence, but privileged people always suffer in the wake of revolution, whether it's the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the American revolution, or any other in which their privileges are curtailed. Despite that fact that this is really an interesting film, how it could possibly deserve all the accolades bestowed on it? There's certainly no danger of confusing this film with ""Doctor Zhivago."" Perhaps the critics thought that because it had an Iranian theme the film must be ""important."" Well, interesting, yes; but important? Hardly."
21,Persepolis,4,9 July 2008,Simplistic manipulation of stereotypes.,"Although allegedly autobiographical, this movie demonstrates very little insight both into the protagonist's psychology (resulting in a flat, fragmented characterization) as well as into larger-scale historical processes, and my hope of either learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary Iran remained unfulfilled. Instead, I found my sensibilities somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded Islamic villains replaced each other taunting, torturing or killing the wantonly victimized prototypical middle-class Iranian whose Western cultural sympathies were patent (and whose exoneration the movie quite blatantly seeks.) The deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass-media market, as it serves to nourish prevalent occidental folk-ideologies (i.e. a ""crowd pleaser""). What redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation - genuinely minimalistic imagery which, nevertheless, always kept the screen rich, expressive and unambiguous - no small fete for which I do give it some stars."
22,Persepolis,9,10 July 2011,A very different kind of animated movie,"Persepolis tells the story of a young girl growing up during the revolution of Iran. She experiences many hardships, friends and family all dying around her and a new dictatorship even worse then the one they originally faced. Her parents decide to send her abroad to Vienna where she experiences more hardships. Having to deal with accepting her heritage, moving around from place to place, and dealing with heartbreak from unsuccessful relationships. She eventually returns to Iran where things have calmed down, but are still not any better then before. She deals with depression, more relationship problems and the pressures of the new regime. All the while she keeps her adventurous personality, and her happy-go-lucky attitude. Persepolis is not your typical animated film. It's a drama about life. The hardships the main character goes through are some that people go through every day. And while you might not relate to the living in a dictatorship part, you can relate to her problems and with her relationships to her friends and family. This film is a perfect example of how animation can be just as moving as live-action. This is a great movie. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone."
23,Persepolis,10,7 February 2011,Wonderful story and animation,"A wonderful autobiographical story of Iranian artist -and movie co-director- Marjane Satrapi, told through animation.I loved the minimalism of the animation, very schematic but attentive to the detail, very newspaper's cartoon-looking, contemporary an artistic, but still unpretentious. The story is presented mostly in a black and white flashback. The tones and shadows of B&W are superb, and the absence of color gives the story a warmth, perspective and seriousness that color alone would have not. B&W is perfect here for presenting past treasured moments full of dreams, hope, ideals, music, smells and happy family times. On the other hand, the BW gives the story the emotional detachment necessary to present many of the hard themes presented in the film: oppression, depression, war, censorship, torture, and loneliness, among others.There is a lot of humor in this movie, too. Just some of Satrapi's love stories are hilariously presented despite their drama and impact on her. The black market of Western Music just put a big smile in my face. Also delightful is the presence of little street animals (cats, dogs, worms) in general scenes, which create an atmosphere of proximity and tenderness even in the saddest moments.Persepolis reminded me sometimes of the freshness and creativity of ""Sita Sings the Blues"" and also in the way different animation sub-styles are used within the movie. For example, here the story of how the Shas of Persia got into power is very ""puppetish"" while the recreation of the different movies watched on TV (Terminator and Godzilla) are very hard, powerful and definitely modern comic.This movie, and the story it tells, opens the eyes to many people (especially to those with prejudices, even if they are not negative) about what does mean and feel like being Iranian and Middle Eastern in Europe, and a certain type of Iranian and woman in Iran, but also how it feels to be and feel a foreigner abroad an in your own country, feelings that are all Universal.I would have liked the movie to go a little bit further in Satrapi's life and include at least the death of her grandmother. However, I did love the very last scene, an homage to that wonderful woman who was Satrapi's nanna.This is sort of movie that will bore to death to movie consumers and that will captivate the experimental and animation lover. The mix is intellectually elating and emotionally absorbing, and feeds the viewer hungry for animation that is different, daring, and meaningful. Go and grab it right now in French with subtitles PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"
24,Persepolis,10,1 May 2009,A Film to Reaffirm Your Belief in Humanity,"Hang on to your hats, folks, this is one of the best films you will EVER see.""Persepolis"" is one of those things that reaffirms your belief in the human spirit. That's right, I said ""things"", not movies. It's a movie that creates believable souls, not characters, whose laughs and tears, triumphs and tragedies ultimately become your own, because its main character follows a quest that all of us can identify with: finding our place in the world.Marjane Satrapi grew up in Iran in the last days of the Shah. While a notorious autocrat with American backing, he presided over the remains of a fragile and proud Empire that was already a hollowed out shell underneath an exterior of openness and splendor.It is a journey that is sweet, funny, harrowing and ultimately heartbreaking. Adapted from Satrapi's own graphic novel, which I consider one of the best books I have ever read in the past ten years. Satrapi as writer and director is a modern day Scheherazade, conjuring up and making us able to feel what a vanished world was like, so that the reign of the Shah and the beginning of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the ensuing Iran-Iraq War, and Satrapi's own experiences in Europe as a teenager feel as alive and as adventurous as any voyage of Sinbad, and her instinct for storytelling matches the legendary Queen's. Under the retelling of her and co-director Vincent Paronnaud, black and white drawings do not just acquire personalities, they acquire souls and spirits.This movie is a showcase of one of those things that only animation can do: boil a story down to its essence in the manner of a Moorish Alchemist. No amount of live action, however well done, will be able to render so starkly the brutality of the Shah's troops, so lovingly and so beautifully the minor irritances of first love, and the way that the tragedy of heartbreak segues into the childish petulances of resentment, and the freedom and bewilderment of a life adrift.""Persepolis"" is a wonderful, humane and bittersweet film, simply put, an experience to be treasured."
25,Persepolis,8,23 November 2008,graphic novel come to life,"Movies don't come much more boldly original or stylistically unique than the animated hit ""Persepolis,"" an autobiographical tale of life under a totalitarian regime as seen through the eyes of a spirited Iranian girl named Marjane Satrapi, who, after immigrating to France, wrote the graphic novel upon which the film (co-directed by Satrapi herself) is based. Satrapi was a wide-eyed, inquisitive youngster when, in 1978, the Shah of Iran was toppled and a new era of freedom appeared to be dawning for that nation's people. Unfortunately, as is so often the case with revolutions, the new regime - in this case, the fundamentalist Islamic Republic led by the Ayatollah Khomeini- turned out to be even more cruel, dictatorial and repressive than the one that got overthrown.As the central character in the movie, Marjane is both an observer of and a participant in the many events that play out in the story, as any number of her own relatives and neighbors fall victim to the systematic purging of all those who refuse to adhere to the present regime's newly enacted draconian measures (women must go out in burkas and head scarves, lovers are not allowed to hold hands in public, etc.) - while those who remain behind live in constant fear that they will find themselves in jail or up in front of a firing squad for a simple, perhaps even inadvertent, code violation. Yet, despite all the bleakness and repression, hope and freedom of thought somehow miraculously flourish and prevail in the human heart, as exemplified by Marjane who refuses to yield her rebellious spirit (she buys bootleg Iron Maiden CDs from hawkers on the street) to the forces that would suppress and imprison it.In terms of style, ""Persepolis"" relies on old-school cell drawings rather than computer graphics for its animation. The starkness of the times and of the setting is enhanced by the simple, ""flat"" look of the largely black-and-white drawings. Yet, the movie is a veritable cornucopia of visual delights, thanks to the animators' generous use of surrealism and magical realism throughout the picture. (If the movie reminds us of any one film, it is probably ""Yellow Submarine"").In quick, bold strokes, director Satrapi, along with her co-director Vincent Paronnaud and their team of expert animators, chronicles not only her own experience but that of an entire nation as well."
26,Persepolis,8,18 November 2008,Film Of The Persians,"Literally translated into ""City of the Persians"", Persepolis is a biographical tale following the trials and tribulations of an Iranian born woman named Marjane Satrapi. Set upon the backdrop of contemporary Iranian politics and history, Persepolis charts her young life as she learns about revolution, rock music and the harsh realities that the modern day world has to offer. It is a simplistically complex, fictionally factional story which is at times funny and in others sections touchingly poignant while always being brutally honest, as she brings her unique perspective from graphic novel onto the big screen. Initially, most striking is the style of animation which is employed throughout the duration of Marjane's story. It is a unique fusion of seemingly simple child-like figures that vary from the normal to almost Monty Python-styled moments of parody and satire, to a delicate understated eye for subtle craftsmanship that interweaves throughout the scenes. Obviously, after the completion of the film, the animation can undeservedly take a back seat in ones mind when compared and contrasted with all the powerful emotions that course through this film, but the most wonderful thing and hand drawn story telling is it opens more options than its live action cousin. Persepolis is a mere ninety minutes in length, yet so much is said and told and not all of it through the use of dialogue. What Persepolis manages to achieve is being able to tell the tales of Marjane and her family and inform us of the historical and political backgrounds of Iran by seamlessly merging into these pictorial vignettes which end up conveying more than a verbal retelling could ever manage. Its animation is as warm and as infectious as the story that unravels, providing a wonderful counterpart to the meat of this piece of cinema.I've read one or two negative reviews from ultra-liberals that state this is propaganda, claiming it to be a non too subtle means of asking the western world to intervene in Iranian politics, but that is biased unpoliticised nonsense. This is only propaganda so far as that this is one persons tale, from an incredibly strong woman, who has gone against the repressive conventions of her country and managed to document her life and her opinions on the world which she has experienced. Whether these are wholly factual I would suppose is up for debate, but the sincerity, honesty and warmth which is felt when watching Persepolis would lead most rational viewers to conclude that Marjane Satrapi has bared her soul in her work. While Persepolis may not be a historical document it is certainly informative, and because we know the goings on that are providing the backdrop for this film were and are real it gives a greater sense of importance and meaning than any imagined text possibly could. Charting Marjane, we follow her through the Iranian revolution as the Shah and their royal lineage ruled with an iron fist over the populous before being over thrown and replaced by a government which made the iron fist look like a wet glove. It puts into context how much our protagonist as an individual how to weigh up in her mind, as she fights with her head and her heart, with the former telling her it is essential to leave, while her heart yearns to be with the loving family that lives in her homeland. Persepolis,however, not only shows the repressive, extremist views of the ""modern"" Iranian state but tackles in an equally unrestrained and delicate manner the uninformed stereotypically infused views and the often self-centrally deluded attitudes of western society, and how we can find ourselves equally repressive in various other ways.Persepolis is a heart felt, heart wrenching, heart warming and well humoured film of a growing girl whose two most important figures in her life are her God and Karl Marx. It is a unique film which has no contemporaries in the originality stakes which is infinitely charming and should not be missed by any lover of animated films, foreign films or just film as a medium. True to itself and the author who experienced everything from unfaithful lovers to atrocities of war, Persepolis is an excellent film which pummels the pesky rodents of Ratatouille in a rat shaped mush because, to be frank, it is much more deserving than the mere nomination it received for best animation."
27,Persepolis,8,24 February 2008,Growing Up,"Marjane Satrapi was born in a middle class family in Iran in 1969. That was the period where Iran was ruled under the government of The Shah. As a young girl, her rebellious nature could lead herself to death sentence or exile when she was going through the Islamic Revolution in the 70's in Iran. Her parents send her to Austria for studies, and she found a new life and self discovery about her country, her nationality and herself.She turn her life story into a graphic novel, which eventually turns into a 2D animation, where the title of the animation shares the same name as her first book: Persepolis.Do not get Persepolis confused with Japanese animation which the movie title sounds similar. Persepolis is based in France, the country where Marjane is living. And here we have both French and English version to cater the needs of the French's and the international market, with Chiara Mastroianni taking the role of Marjane with her voice, Catherine Denevue as Mrs Satrapi, the mother. Sean Penn and Iggy Pop contributes in the English version, with Penn as Mr Satrapi, the father. Iggy Pop as Anouche, Marjane's uncle, a political prisoner under the revolution who supports communism.The movie begins with Marjane sitting in the smoking corner at an airport in France, reflecting her past. As mentioned earlier, her rebellious nature puts her in danger, where she is against the Shah when Anouche was imprisoned. After the revolution, the Shah was overthrow and Iran has become a Islamic Republic. Marjane challenges her religious teacher over issues of political prisoners, buys illegal Iron Maiden cassette tapes, wears a vest with the wording 'Punk is Not De(a)d' on the streets, attends party and makes red wine illegally. This not only reflects her nature, but also the environment that she is living with her family. Parties and alcohols are illegal, and people risked their lives in enjoying a party.When Iraq attacked Iran, her neighbourhood was blown up, and her parents sends her to Austria, partially due to her safety, and also putting her into a environment that is suitable for her. In Austria, she experiences freedom, drugs, sex, wondering around the streets and eventually back to Iran, only to find out that she no longer fits into the way of live of Iran. Her failed marriage eventually brings her back to France, where her life continues.The story is not presented with fanciful drawings, neither the animation is presented in 3D style, which seems to be widely used by studios for blockbuster animations. Persepolis is presented in a very traditional black and white 2D animation, which truly tells a story of a girl's growing up journey during the period of chaos. It is not your usual Walt Disney traditional 2D animations too, since the story deals with a girl who do not listens to bedtime story of a prince and princess living happily ever after, but how people die for freedom before bedtime.With Marjene being one of the director of the film, the animation looks more realistic, and gives the audience a inside view of Iran in her days, on why Western culture is not accepted in her country, and the culture shock that she experiences.Do take a break from normal 3D animation and sink yourself into the world of good old black and white 2D animation."
28,Persepolis,9,23 February 2008,"Creative, original Iranian coming-of-age story","Persepolis is a very original, creative, animated story about the coming of age of a young middle-class woman in Iran. The story is done in flashbacks and most of the animation is in black and white except at the beginning and the end of the film when the narrator is speaking in the present.Persepolis allows us to view Iran from the perspective of a very sophisticated, middle-class family in Tehran, specifically the childhood, adolescence and young adulthood of the film's scenarist, Marjane Satrapi. The characters speak in French however and not Farsi, the native language in Iran.At one point Satrapi moves to Vienna as a teenager where she attends a French school. Satrapi takes us through her childhood under the Shah and then shows us the repression of the Islamic revolutionaries who take over the country. However, her criticism of the regime does not mean she rejects her country--she still regards herself as a patriot but one who longs for freedom. She leaves Iran twice; first as a 12 year old girl and at the end as a young woman. When she returns the first time it's because she's homesick. The second time is for good since she now realizes she must fulfill her destiny as a freedom-loving artist! Persepolis never gets preachy and that's the beauty of the movie. Iran in all its complexities is shown in a series of brilliant vignettes mainly focusing on what happens to Satrapi as a child and to her parents and grandmother. Persepolis shows the Iran-Iraq war up close; one searing moment is when Satrapi sees the hand of one of her neighbors sticking out of the rubble of a building just bombed in an Iraqi air raid. The Islamic fanatics who make ordinary peoples' lives miserable don't speak in a monolithic tongue--Satrapi does well in showing the diversity of their voices (Satrapi's father pays off a 15 year old who might take the family in for violating the strict dress code; Satrapi's mother talks back to a real hardliner in the streets who callously remarks that he's basically raped women like her and murdered them whenever he felt like it; and Satrapi herself mercilessly mocks her female teachers who want her to conform to the regime's repressive code for women).When Satrapi leaves Iran and takes up residence in Vienna, there are a series of wonderful comic scenes detailing her inability to find the right guy (one great sequence shows the 'before and after' perceptions of a lover that ends up cheating on her). Satrapi's grandmother is the true moral voice of the film; she coaches Satrapi on the importance of having integrity in life and there's one great moment toward the end of the film where the grandmother castigates her granddaughter for straying from the path of integrity (in the scene Satrapi falsely has a man arrested claiming that he insulted her). Not all the characters are explained in depth such as the father (we'd like to see what he does for a living) as well as Satrapi's husband (we hardly find out anything about him). But these are minor shortcomings in a film that is so fresh and original. The film ends as the Revolutionary Guards (or Vice Squad) raid a clandestine party which Satrapi attends. The police end up chasing the men to the roof; while most escape, one friend of the author falls to his death. It's at this moment that Satrapi knows that she must leave Iran for good. I recommend that everyone go see Persepolis not only to understand what is going on in Iran today but to see a dramatic coming-of-age story of a young woman who finds herself despite inner torment and brutal societal repression."
29,Persepolis,9,19 February 2008,"Funny, heartbreaking, poignant slice-of-life/history lesson/coming of age animated instant classic; a true work of art!","PERSEPOLIS (2007) ***1/2 (VOICES OF : Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve, Danielle Darrieux, Simon Abkarian, Gabrielle Lopes, Francois Jerosme) Fantastic animated adaptation of the biographical graphic novel work by Marjane Satrapi about her upbringing as a French speaking Iranian girl trying to acclimate to her trouble nation and life in general with a certain jaded perspective yet a hope for a better existence overall. Poignant slice-of-life melodrama and blend of history lesson that translates very well with exquisite black and white animation that is truly a work of art that speaks any language. Funny, heartbreaking and inspiring. (Dirs: Vincent Paronnaud and Satrapi)"
30,Persepolis,10,7 January 2008,A fabulous true story!,"The animation does an excellent job in conveying the true nature of a revolution to the audience through the eyes of one its own victims. It is as unbiased as can be, and it makes a familiar story to all Iranians familiar to the world. While telling the melancholic turn of a young girl's life, it tries its best to cover the highlights of what went on in Iran prior and after the so-called ""Islamic Revolution"". Comedy is used intelligently at right times in order to bring the audience out of the gloomy black and white atmosphere for at least a few seconds. The black and white context turns into color only in the end when supposedly the bright portion of Marjane's life begins. Overall, it is an admirable piece of art, ""Absolutely""!"
31,Persepolis,6,11 January 2008,A personal history: engaging but not compelling,"I saw ""Persepolis"" after hearing a lot of buzz, along with a radio interview with the writer/director, Ms. Satrapi, so I had a good idea what to expect going in. And, bottom line, the film did not disappoint -- but it didn't ""wow"" me either.As a personal history, a sort of animated diary, it did the only thing it could do: show us a deeply personal account of events that have shaped our world. So, in that capacity, I found it educational, and generally engaging. After all, we all probably know the basic facts of these events. But how many of us have had such a subjective, impressionistic account, one which, by definition, will be skewed to the storyteller's point-of-view, but provides a valuable perspective nonetheless? And while I agree with some of the other comments on this board (the film employs predictable cliché, jokes that fall flat, etc.), I can forgive those as minor faults in an otherwise noble, and at times quite entertaining, effort.As a film, however, ""Persepolis"" falls short. One of the basic requirements of storytelling, at least in most cinematic genres, is that the filmmaker engage the audience emotionally, especially if he or she is trying to put across a moral or specific political message. And this is where Persepolis never really grabbed me. While anyone can easily empathize with the exploits of a darling, precocious little girl in such extraordinary circumstances, the ""episodic"" way her story is told prevented me from truly identifying with the Marjane character. We want to feel that the protagonist's goals are our goals. But if she doesn't really have a goal, other than to grow up, there's nothing for us to latch onto emotionally. So, by ""episodic"" I mean a series of vignettes that are disconnected from an over-arching goal, i.e., something the protagonist is trying to achieve that makes up the ""meat"" of the story.I watched ""Persepolis"" with a feeling of detached amusement, and general hopefulness that Marjane the cartoon character would at least grow into adulthood (which I already knew the real Marjane had managed, so no suspense there). And I certainly appreciated the insider's perspective on this piece of history. But ultimately, to tell an entire life story, one that encompasses weighty political and cultural current events lessons, is a lot to ask an audience to connect with emotionally. (This is why many successful biopics -- ""Capote"" and ""Schindler's List"" come to mind -- focus on a discrete period of the subject's life and manage to convey with great feeling the challenges that person faced. Which may explain why, despite the narrative shortcomings I describe, the largely Iranian-American audience at the screening I attended seemed to love ""Persepolis"", having their own personal and emotional touchstone by which to connect to the film.) I left the theater feeling better informed on several levels. But not really touched."
32,Persepolis,8,23 January 2008,Some exaggerations in the movie,"I saw this movie last night. I myself am a girl live in Iran. I grew up during the war. I know the situations. I think there are some exaggerations in the movie. Maybe these events belong to 20 years ago. Because now we are free to wear sneaker or the same objects, we have to wear scarf but it can be very small, and we can wear make up in the streets. In schools, boys and girls are sitting together, no separation as it is emphasized in the movie. I am highly educated girl in Iran, which got my MS in Engineering with great male professors; there is no limitation for women study or work here. Another mistake of the film is about the war. Almost all the people who died in the war scarified themselves for the country, and for our freedom. It is not because of that plastic key or what else mentioned in the movie. Now here in Iran we have very colorful cities, not that black and white in the movie, we have a lot of freedom and joy, we never have to wear long black scarf. We are free in the universities and at our work and in the cities. The other problems shown in the film are because of the revolution. I think every revolution has the same transient events, as mentioned in the film too. We made revolution for a greater good, for freedom and not being the slave of the powerful countries, as we were during the Shah period, and little by little, we will reach it."
33,Persepolis,10,29 February 2008,It didn't win the Oscar because it's too serious for children and too realistic for academy guys.,"In my opinion, this is THE cartoon of the year. Despite being serious and political, it is very well paced and told the story into the depth. Especially, it is about immigrant lives and historical changes, which are mostly satisfying and touching for those who live in another country.Yes, people may prefer Ratattoulie for many reasons. People would say that Persepolis is too serious and dark for children and being a cartoon. However, if you've ever experienced the historical change of ideology and faith, you will know how honest it is. The movie is not about Communism, the movie is not about Muslin. It's a tragedy of a country, a tragedy of a certain generation who has to adapt too fast to the changing political weather, and they ended up with very ambiguous faith and value. Remember the scene in which the God talked to the main character in her dream, when Karl Max also showed up and argued that people are still fighting for freedom. If you haven't lived in a communism country ever before, you won't be able to sense the dark humor in it.Overally, it is very well done. And all the characters are likable.10/10. completely beat my expectations."
34,Persepolis,9,25 January 2008,Could be better!,"First of all i must say that it is the best, telling about all the situations before and after the Revolution, the feelings and the Truth about the Iran-Iraq war and many other things. The truth about the western that they brought us that damn War, the truth that under pressure of loaded Gun pointed to us people of Iran try to find Freedom. but the disappointing part is the cuts between the Original Story and the Movie, lots of parts Omitted. like the two challenges with that different Mollah or the views of immigrants from south. After all, i was so excited watching Perspolis, i hope for all the Iranian to remain Iranian even if Iran means Terrorism!"
35,Persepolis,9,11 January 2008,Awesome movie.  History buffs can go read a book if they don't like it.,"This is an awesome movie. For those of you who said that this is a poor history lesson are simply morons. If I want a history lesson on Iran I'll watch the frigging History Channel. This is not that. This is a tender, emotional, entertaining film, told from the point of view of a young girl, not a complete history of Iran. In fact there are probably many exiled Iranians who don't know the true history or what the exact events were which so violently divided their country. This is precisely that story. It is the story of a sweet and innocent girl who doesn't agree with her system and is later forced into exile. The story is touching, entertaining, remarkable, funny, and even a bit educational. To quote another commenter here: ""It's like watching or reading a version of 'Iran for Dummies."" that's find for me. I loved the movie."
36,Persepolis,,1 August 2010,Eye of the Tiger,"""Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet.""  Survivor Vincent Paronnaud directs ""Persepolis"", an animated feature film about life in pre-revolutionary Iran. Like the various Italian ""Holocaust dramas"" of the 1970s, which examined the struggles of middle and upper class Jews under the rule of Mussolini, ""Persepolis"" mostly juxtaposes the ordinariness and banality of life under a repressive government (the US-backed Shah of Iran and the despots who followed) with those bursts of fear, paranoia and state sanctioned violence typically experienced by those living under such regimes.The film also functions well as a kind of dumbed down history lesson (for clueless western audiences). So we're shown the way the West implemented and supported its puppet dictators in Iran, how the US opposed the people's revolution, how it extended its international projects to assassinate communists into the Middle East, and how the populist revolution that kicked out the Shah was quickly hijacked by Islamists. The latter point is typical of history: when progressive parties are destroyed, super right-wing groups (often supported by the West) step in to fill the void. Think the Islamist groups which moved in when France moved out of Algeria, or Israel's tactical support of Hamas. The enemy of your enemy is your friend, and the crazier he is, the better for you.The film also highlights the way Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein, essentially a Western puppet tasked with defending Western regional interests after the loss of Shah Reza, attacked Iran and waged a massive war on the country during the 80s (1980 to 1988). There's no talk of ""Iraqgate""  the US using banks in Italy to funnel billions of taxpayer dollars into the Iraqi war machine  or the way that many countries supplied both Iran and Iraq with weapons in a deliberate attempt to facilitate as much destruction as possible. Instead, the film uses the conflict as a backdrop upon which to stress the way life, somehow, often manages to continue on as normal. It doesn't matter if jets are flying overhead or bombs are dropping. All that matters is sneaking past a checkpoint to get to a friend's beer party or saving up enough money to buy a Michael Jackson mix-tape. The trivialities of life never stop. They only take on a more surreal edge in times of conflict.Interestingly, the film stresses that Iran is not an Arab nation and that a great deal of Iranian culture and public opinion is not a unified bloc. The country is very stratified with great differences in opinions. The film therefore humanizes those whom most Westerners, sadly, see as but a barbaric horde. And so we watch as families interact, play cards, have parties, talk of torture and imprisonment over coffee or go shopping whilst missiles fly overhead. With a visual style that utilizes simple, child-like drawings, the film thus plays like an Iranian version of ""The Diaries of Anne Frank"", a little girl's clumsily and hastily scribbled memoirs telling a tale of revolution, warfare and loss.Finally - and this is what the film does best - ""Persepolis"" charters the creation of an artist. Early in the film, Marjane, the film's central character, is sent to Vienna where she continues her schooling thousands of miles away from her friends, family and country. What the film does is treat Marjane as a character in perpetual exile, always trying (and failing) to ingratiate herself with various groups (punks, anarchists, communists, hippies, nihilists, islamists etc). Marjane's inability to form an identity, the fact that she's always an outsider and yet ""belongs"" to all these different niches, then gives Marjane a sort of artistic omnipresence. Yes, this leads to much misery and loneliness, but it is this suffering which fine tunes her senses and gives her an almost fiery, defiant spirit.This defiant spirit is linked to two things in the film. Firstly, to Marjane's Grandmother, and secondly to the song ""Eye of the Tiger"", made famous by the ""Rocky"" series. ""Freedom always has a price,"" Grandma says in the film, as she teachers Marjane that being free, being an artist, requires one to ""go the distance"" and ""survive"". In other words, artistic ""truths"", or ""truths"" in general, are as dangerous (everyone in the film dies or gets in trouble by sticking up for truths and principles) as they are beautiful (the film ends with Marjane recounting the lovely smell of her grandmother).""Persepolis"" has been praised for poking fun at the more tyrannical aspects of Islam, but these supposedly ""edgy topics"" (women's rights, fundamentalism etc) have been handled better by many other contemporary Iranian films. Indeed, ""Persepolis"" is so tame that it was released in Iran and welcomed for its message. Ten years ago the film would have been banned and its makers crucified. The film's ""cynical"" attack on ideology - Western and Eastern - is itself naive. Satire and humour no longer lead the naive ideological consciousness to a point at which it can recognise and dissolve its own conditioning. Rather, ideology's dominant mode of functioning is now itself cynical. It allows the modern subject to be aware of the distance between the ideological mask and the social reality (see ""Full Metal Jacket""), but nonetheless still manages to insist upon the mask. Cynical reason is no longer naive, but is a paradox of an enlightened false consciousness: one knows the falsehood but still can not renounce it. The result is the hero of ""Persepolis"", a super-jaded version of MTV's cynical ""Daria"", only less effectual.8.5/10 - See ""Waltz With Bashir""."
37,Persepolis,,6 January 2009,Won me over ...,"I started, stopped, and restarted this movie several times in the beginning... it was subtitled, black and white, sounded like some political subject matter and I didn't have high hopes.... but I kept coming back because the little girl character was portrayed so atypically. She was acting like any little girl that I might come across my own street ... not one in a culture with a significantly different culture/lifestyle/political system. The film skillfully moves through about 20 years of her life during which Iran underwent major repressive changes.I don't know whether the writer (Marjane Satrapi) purposefully westernized the character or whether the depiction is accurate (my guess is that it's mostly the latter). She said in interviews that she wanted to let people know that we're all the same - Iranians are not the stereotyped militants that we see on the news everyday.Well, irregardless, the movie is hard to stop watching once you get into it. Her life is so up and down, you want to see what's going to happen next. The movie feels like it ends a bit prematurely without any further info, but you can read about the real life Marjane on the Internet.It's a drama-oriented animated film and I'd say it's definitely worth watching."
38,Persepolis,8,8 May 2008,This is a film which really should be seen,"Whilst ""photo-real"" animation is wonderful to look at, there is a charm that hand drawn animation holds now that it is out of favour. A certain nostalgia makes films like ""Persepolis"" wonderful to look at. However, drawing on her graphic novel, Marjane Satrapi, with the assistance of Vincent Paronnaud, has created a film of magnificent style told in glorious monochrome. But this film has a lot of depth as well. It is a particularly interesting film, combining humour, tragedy, politics and an incredible human story.The film is split rigidly into three acts and there are certain problems with its structure. At times, it feels very much like a series of comic strips. There are a number of little bits and pieces which are simply dropped into the film and, particularly in the first act, the film doesn't necessarily flow very well. However, it makes up for this by telling a fascinating story.The history of Iran is not known by many and this whistle-stop tour through the key points draws you and you feel the character's joy and suffering all the more because of it. With this as the backdrop (though it very often pushes itself to the fore) the formative years of the autobiographical Marjane are played out. She goes from being a young, wide-eyed, joyful and imaginative girl to an oppressed, emotional and unstable teenager. It really should be a tragedy in every sense, but Marjane's spirit, humour and free-thinking turn this into a surprisingly uplifting story.The second act takes place in eighties Vienna and deals with the central issue of identity. Sent away because she is too open-minded for her own safety, Marjane struggles to find herself in a foreign land, lying to herself and having a long string of bad luck. She is no different from any other teenager, but away from home and her family she falls into self-destruction easier than most. Her relationship with her own country becomes very strained and her reluctance to accept her origins weighs on her. It is a fascinating portrayal of a woman and intelligent exploration of how where we come from influences who we are.It is a pity that (in Britian at any rate) it seems that the original language version with subtitles is not on general release. But the dubbing works perfectly well and armed with a delicious sense of humour, tremendous visual style and an intelligent, important and interesting story, this film, despite its faults, is one you really should see. It is more than a simple curiosity. It will move you, amuse you and engage you."
39,Persepolis,8,5 May 2008,"It may lose direction toward the end, but Persepolis is funny, informative, moving and tragic in ways that so many ""proper"" films aren't these days","Among so many other wonderful things, Persepolis is an example of a graphic novel that has been lifted to the cinema screen without the aid of wondrous and realistic digimation, but rather hand-drawn monochrome shadow theatre. People move in mysterious ways, buildings look ominous, and many animated details are thinly layered. But the cartoonish simplicity of the visual aesthetic serves this, actually rather human, story so remarkably well. It is the kind of movie that marries the personal and the political perfectly, to be informative as much as it is entertaining and moving.We are following the trails of a young Iranian girl from Tehran called Marjane. Around the late 1970s, just before the fall of the Iranian Shah, Marjane is still carefree and blissfully unaware of her country's struggles against an oppressive Shah. She loves Bruce Lee and jamming to Iron Maiden records. But her leftist politically-conscious family make sure she is aware of what is going on. She learns why Iran has a monarchy in the first place, and what role the West had in making sure they didn't institute a republic. Her communist uncle Anoush tells her of how an uprising would only help Iran, since nothing could be worse than living under the Shah. We then live through the revolution with Marjane's family, as the country goes from an oppressive monarchy to an even more oppressive Islamic fundamentalist republic. All women are required to wear veils, and many cultural items, including alcohol and Marjane's Iron Maiden records, become illegal. Public displays of affection are frowned upon. What the film captures brilliantly is the struggle her family faces in trying to raise a normal girl in an oppressive environment. At one point her mother turns to her now grown-up daughter, who hastily married her boyfriend, and says ""When I was your age, your father and I could hold hands in public"". As a youngster she tries to remain true to herself, and even goes as far as wearing a jacket with ""Punk is not ded (sic)"" written on the back of it, much to the chagrin of her neighbours and city-watchmen.Her parents eventually decide Iran is not good enough for their daughter, and send her to Vienna for education. With a new country, comes new ideas, but fresh problems. She experiences the snooty racism of the west, and becomes embarrassed by her own identity. The movie also demonstrates the naivety many westerners share about the middle east, or just the world in general, by their apathy to political causes. Marjane was raised by a politically-literate family, and feels strongly about the causes many Iranians died for.Where the movie really shines is showing Marjane become a woman. Although Persepolis is much about the political struggles that one faces in 1980s Iran, it is also about the personal struggles of an every-day woman. Marjane discovers boys and parties, but also the heartbreak relationships bring. Eventually she returns to Iran where said parties and relationships are frowned upon.Persepolis is about a world far too often untouched by western filmmakers, but it is a film that tells a universal story. The filmmaker, Vincent Parronaud, uses pop-culture references allowing us to easily relate to the film's protagonist. Indeed so much of Persepolis entails the struggle one has of freedom under an oppressive regime, but Marejane remains defiant throughout the film. She is the antithesis of the stereotypical meekness of middle eastern women; proud of her heritage, literate and consistently questioning the world. In many ways Personalise is a tribute the female spirit. Marjorie never gives up hope, even if the first image of the film is of a grown up Marjane sitting in a Parisian airport, looking forlornly at the ground. We know melancholy will accompany the following story, but what beauty it pays to it's inhabitants. Marjane's grandmother, who advises her granddaughter throughout her life to stay true to herself. Her parents who try their best to raise a smart, independent girl. And her uncle, who died because of what he believed. Such tragedy, and yet a movie as funny, moving and generally uplifting as Persepolis demands to be seen by everyone."
40,Persepolis,8,13 February 2008,ABBA is for wimpsPersepolis,"Here we have France's official entry for foreign film at the Oscars, the animated film Persepolis. This intrigues me for many reasons. One, it is a cartoon and almost destined for the nod in that category; two, it is about Iran, by an Iranian who took France as an adopted home in her 20's, and third, the wonderful film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly had a real shot at winning the award, let alone getting a nomination (but then it was directed by an American, so who knows?). By no means is the film unworthy of the praise or accolades; it is in actuality very well done. Maybe not quite as good as I have heard, but than this is not the type of film I normally put my sights on being almost documentary-like in its biographical and historical nature. As a visual piece, one can't complain though, and as a piece of history, telling of the pain and horrors that went on in the Middle Eastern country, it is quite shocking and informative (albeit from a viewpoint that was very anti-war/regime, not that her family should have been for the genocide, but it is a biased view nonetheless). With multiple sequences that are as powerful as any scenes all year, there are just too many moments showing the naïve immaturity of our heroine as she deals with relationships and depression. The weight of what is happening on a global level is so strong as a story thread that the ""little"" things took me away from the movie and caused me to become a tad restless waiting for the intriguing moments to come back.Marjane Satrapi lived a very interesting life. Her family contained many important members in Iran, from a Prince, numerous revolutionaries, imprisoned and killed Communists, and a couple of strong-willed parents, fighting the good fight, yet still maintaining a balance to keep themselves alive. The film is a very personal piece of work, telling about her life from childhood to mid-20'sfrom precocious youngster wishing to be the last prophet of the world to a cynical, jaded woman who had survived hard times both physically and emotionally. Her outspoken demeanor leads to some tense moments that almost seem to be diffused a little too easily. In a country that is so repressive and so against women, how can all these men allow her to say what she does and just cower in embarrassment? I am surprised she survived to turn 20 in the first place with the way the film portrays Iran.This is of course a fictional remembrance, and I'm sure there were some liberties taken. Much like American Splendor from a few years back, Persepolis is based off a series of autobiographical graphic novels created by Satrapi. In that regard, the tale is infused with comedy and fantasy throughout, helping to keep interest and counter the heavy subject matter at the crux of it all. So much of this humor works perfectlythe figure study model cloaked, the ""Punk is Ded"" jacket, and early Bruce Lee moves, kicking another youngster in the head at a partybut a few times it can be somewhat cringe-inducingthe ""Eye of the Tiger"" montage came off hokey to me. Her vocal outbursts and putting lesser people (although in positions of power) in their place help shape her character and show how one can fight back against a country that gave up on its people without using physical violence herself.The animation at times is absolutely breathtaking. Using color to delineate between the present storytelling Marjane with her story's lead in black and white is well utilized, if a bit unnecessary considering her being in color has no bearing except for showing an older age. Where the movie truly succeeds, however, is in the heavy/dark moments. The stark contrast of the colorless majority really brings some weight to the proceedings. With somber music overlaying those sequences of battle and oppression, we are treated to some events that stay with you way after the film has finished. The initial siege after the fall of the Shah is fantastic with its black, silhouetted soldiers combining into a massive blob advancing on the innocent civilians. Even atmosphere is added with smoke and fog, a very nice trick for a field of depth that is completely two-dimensional using only overlapping layers to show space. My favorite piece, though, is a chase on the rooftops after an illegal party is broken up by the Guardians. In almost complete silence we see the pursuit right until its inevitable conclusionheartbreaking.Full credit goes to Satrapi for having the fortitude to not only survive the life she lived at such a young age, but also the ability to tell the world about it. I'm sure her stories have served as somewhat of a catharsis for herself, especially after seeing her Uncle Anoush tell his tales of exile and persecution so that the family's story is known forever. She seems to have taken everything very seriously and put it upon herself to not let all those in her life to have died and suffered in vain. Always strong-willed and unafraid to speak her mind, she was the true revolutionary. Learning from experience and many mistakes of her own, Marjane grew up very fast and never forgot her heritage or her home. Even years later from the last time she stepped foot on Middle Eastern soil, she still answers a cabbie's question of where she's coming from, without pause, as Iran."
41,Persepolis,8,4 February 2008,Reveals universal emotions,"Though Iranian women participated in the revolution of 1979, fundamentalist mullahs led by Ayatollah Khomeini, once in power, instituted a system of gender apartheid, building their regime on the premise that women are physically, intellectually, and morally inferior to men. Adapted from a four-volume graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi in the style of Spiegleman's Maus, Persepolis is a sensitive animé about a young girl's coming of age during political and social revolution. Using high contrast black and white hand-drawn animation in shifting styles, the film unleashes a torrent of memories of people, places, and events from Marjane's life that reveal the universal emotions of loss and loneliness that accompany exile.Told in voice-over and flashbacks, Satrapi recounts her tortuous physical and emotional journey over the last twenty years in a mixture of memories, history, and imagination. The film begins when the adult Marjane (Chiara Mastroianni) is asked for her passport and ticket in an unidentified airport. Adjusting her veil, Marjane walks away and the screen turns from color to black and white as the young woman reflects on her life as a child in the early days of the Iranian Revolution after the Western-supported Shah has been deposed in favor of an Islamic fundamentalist regime. Marjane (voiced by Gabrielle Lopes) is a lively eight-year old full of exuberance and hope. Her grandmother (voiced by Danielle Darrieux) provides the young girl with unconditional love and counsel to act with integrity and follow her best instincts.Her parents (Catherine Deneuve and Simon Abkarian) do not support the Shah who imprisoned Marjane's Uncle Aouche (Francois Jerosme) for being a communist. The family rejoices when the Shah is overthrown in 1979 but cannot anticipate an even more brutal repression under the Islamic fundamentalists who take over the country. Anyone who challenges the authority of the fundamentalists in power is persecuted. Uncle Anouche, a communist, is rearrested and executed, a telling blow to the young girl. Marjane tries to maintain her former way of life and, as a rebellious teenager, buys Western music from black market street merchants and wears a leather jacket with ""Punk Is Not Dead"" on her back. Her parents, however, concerned for her safety, send her to Vienna to stay with a cousin where she attends a convent school that only exacerbates her feeling of estrangement.It is there that she joins a crowd of young rebels but criticizes them for their ""nonchalance and forced nihilism"". Unable to fit in at the school or with her cousin, Marjane moves from house to house, finally staying with an older woman and her dog Muki. After a series of love affairs that lead nowhere, depressed and hungry, Marjane eventually returns to Iran and in the end leaves for France. Though the second half of the film veers close to soap opera, what remains is not the ups and downs of an unhappy young woman, but the brutal conditions women have to endure in Iran which continue to this day. Unable to show affection in public, they are forced to cover their hair and body except for their face and hands and forbidden to use cosmetics.They are also banned from pursuing higher education in the majority of fields of study and must be taught in segregated classrooms, and are unable to work in most professions without her husband's permission. Persepolis provides a look at history that many in today's audience might be unfamiliar with, yet the film is essentially a comic book that never digs too deeply in exploring Marjane's feelings about the turmoil around her. Nonetheless, it is an involving experience filled with humor as well as sadness, a tribute to the resilience of one human being who struggled through a difficult childhood to become a thoughtful and generous young woman."
42,Persepolis,9,18 March 2008,A life story told in animation,"Plot summary: It really blows living in Iran. Luckily that description is a lot simpler than the image we get in ""Persepolis"". The movie-makers paint an image of a normal country, just like all others under the influence of the West, and filled with people trying to get along with the oppressive theocracy that still rules there.In the center is Marjane, a young Iranian girl from an intellectual family. As we first meet her, she's a rebellious little kid in a relatively normal society, although controlled by a dictator. Before she's even grown up, life changes as the corruption and the decadence of the Sha is replaced by the harsh misogynist rule of the bearded islamists. We follow Marjane through Iran and Europe as she becomes a woman. The animation is top-notch, more simplistic than the recent ""Renaissance"" but with more feeling and expression. Quite possibly, the fact that it's animated helps us past the barrier of physical appearance(no-one looks distinctly ""foreign"") and quickly makes us accept the people as just that, people.The story contains a lot of tragedy and sadness, but also a good dose of humour. There are several scenes that will give your propaganda- influenced view of Iran a good kick in the nuts(some kids showing smuggled ABBA records in R.E., for example). Best of all, Persepolis once and for all established that you can create serious animated movies for grown-ups(as if anime hasn't done that the past 20 years). There is nothing childish about Persepolis, and it'll probably bore the hell out of kids. So watch this movie and revel in the gorgeous animation, widen your horizon a bit in the story-line, laugh at the moments of humour and feel the lump in your throat in the sad parts."
43,Persepolis,8,19 December 2007,Persepolis,"With ""Persepolis"" Marjane Satrapi made an adaptation of her own comic. The story is very personal and tells us about how she grew up in a hostile environment to be a strong-minded and independent woman. Yet on the other side, ""Persepolis"" also tells the story of country that struggles in a time of uncertainty. No one had an overview about what was happening, even in a very political family like Marjane's. And when the revolution was over, people found out that the new system was even worse than the old one. The film is drawn very well and in a totally fitting way. Satrapi said, she didn't make a live action movie, because then audiences would have their preconceptions much more in mind as if it was animated. I don't know if that's the right motivation (even though it is the truth), but she's right in any case with the fact, that this story is universally applicable and deserves to be seen by the audience not just as something that happens far away in a country in the Middle East (uuhhh)."
44,Persepolis,5,31 December 2008,Great Black-White Visuals; Not-So-Great Main Character,"""Thumbs up"" for the cool black-and-white animation. In this day of blazing, computerized colors (which I also love), it was refreshing and fascinating to see artwork done in this fashion. Actually, black-and-white ""cartoons"" and ""feature films,"" I don't believe, have been done since the 1930s.....so it's been awhile.That's the good news. The bad news is the story and main character, both of which (whom) I found very unappealing. To put it bluntly: the little girl and then grown woman, ""Marjane Satrapi,"" is a pain in the butt, not a sympathetic ""good guy"" to root for.....just really annoying. The story is filled with mainly left-wing clichés and bias against anything American or Western (which includes ""Biblical"") - nothing new there, film-wise. For example, her grandpa who was devotee of Lenin/Marxism was a great man. The fact that Sean Penn was involved with this Iranian story should tell you something.Then again, even without any politics, it wasn't a likable coming-of-age film, because the main character rants too much. Filmmakers just can't resist rebels-with (or without)-a-cause who badmouth her parents, and that certainly describes ""Marji."" That's cute? No, it isn't and it's one reason this film bombed at the box office and at DVD rental stores. At least the movie gives some of the good-and-bad of making rebellious choices in life. Kudos for that. The story is not all bad and some of the characters are very likable, just not the spoiled girl.Note: I was shocked they used white subtitles up against the black/white drawings. Even on Blu-Ray, I had to really look hard to read them at many points. That was just plain stupid on the part of the director and did help make the film appealing, either."
45,Persepolis,1,27 November 2013,A terrible ramble,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to sit through. There was no plot, no joy - but relentless misery, and a hit-you-over-the-head message landing with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, over and over and over again. I liked the artwork, thought the start boded well, and settled in to a meandering tale. If the idea was to push the viewer to want to play in traffic, then it was a success. The main character was completely unsympathetic despite the horrific things that happened to her and her family. This is a film made about a terrible time and injustice done to millions. Don't think I'm unsympathetic to any of that. Just please don't make anyone watch this movie to get the point."
46,Persepolis,5,18 September 2009,"Standard coming of age story, but animated and foreign.","I'm sorry, but what exactly is the big deal? If this movie were set in Communist China, or the Soviet Union, or the American South 50 years ago, or dozens of other places, I doubt it would have received the response it has. At this moment in time, post 9/11, we're fascinated by the Middle East, and most Americans probably still confuse Persians with Arabs.The animation is interesting, no more. I responded to it less-- a lot less-- than I do the work of animators from Ub Iwerks to Friz Freleng and Alex Anderson to Brad Bird. And the writing? Nothing special.As for the story-- unpleasant girl on boring search for self during political turmoil. The Iranian overlords are presented in an entirely simplistic way, which could be seen as appropriate for a juvenile protagonist. Unfortunately, she's not a sympathetic protagonist. She's self-absorbed, self-indulgent, fickle, and she seems to jump on just about every cultural bandwagon she encounters.I've never understood the impulse to make films about uninteresting people. Her graphic novel told me more that I need to know about Ms. Satrapi."
47,Persepolis,5,15 September 2014,"Graphically nice, story so so","I liked this animation, but mainly because of the visuals. Graphically it's very appealing and atmospheric. The black and white and the shadows really transmit the horror that it must be to experience unfreedom coming upon you, what it is to feel helpless and what religions can do to mankind.But, as others have stated, unfortunately the main character is not very likable. She doesn't come across as someone who is genuinely suffering, but more as a spoiled girl who suddenly cannot continue to live her happy-go-lucky life. Instead of finding a way out or doing something against it, she becomes embittered and that's it. That makes her very unsympathetic. Many important details are not explained, for example why she can leave the country, but her parents, who have money (and probably influence), remain there.10 stars for the visuals, 1 for the story, 5 for both."
48,Persepolis,10,1 March 2008,Best Comics To Film Adaptation Hands Down,"A great combination of style and substance and a one of a kind animated film, not to mention one of the best comic book adoptions I've ever seen. The film works for those who've read the books, and manages to include all the necessary information for those who haven't. It's funny, thoughtful, visually engaging, and much more somber than the book ever was. Still, it's a really good film with a really good story, that raises the bar for serious animated works. Satrapi's voice resonates with a clarity here and an eye for visual flourish, that many auto-biographical novelists miss. The Iranian characters speaking French was a bit of an adjustment at first, but once you settle past that its' gold. Its rare to find a film both easily enjoyable, politcally relevant, and beautiful, much less in an animated film, maybe When The Wind Blows or Plague Dogs come close, but this film has a dare I say, a humanity, lost not only in American made films about the middle east and it's peoples but in animated films as well. Refreshing new cinematic literature."
49,Persepolis,10,24 February 2008,Greatest animated movie of the year.,"There is an old saying that goes like this, ""They don't make pictures the way they used to."" Not since THE SIMPSONS MOVIE, there was such a movie that based on a comic book, which was based on the creator's life. The film deserves an Oscar, so that way the creator and film-maker would get their recognition. This film talks about the politics and war in Tehran and all the troubles Marjane Satrapi has to face in life. Both inside and out. You will laugh, you will cry, you will end up wondering why. It is a very interesting film, because this film is made with traditional animation rather than all this CGI Pixar or Dreamworks films like SHREK (I was getting tired of the film after part three) or worse, anime (don't get me started). The interesting thing is, that the Marjane Satrapi in the present is shot in color while the flashback is done in black and white. In conclusion, this film is great. It talks about all the troubles in the Middle East in another perspective. Like the NEW YORK TIMES said, ""Take the kids without feeling guilty."" I highly recommend it because sometimes the mind desires peaceful things. It needs to Yin in rather than Yang out constantly. Rated PG-13 for mature thematic material including violent images, sexual references, language and brief drug content."
50,Persepolis,10,14 February 2008,A Nutshell Review: Persepolis,"It is not difficult to understand the growing number of accolades that are being bestowed upon Persepolis, directed by Vincent Paronnaud and Marjane Satrapi, which is based upon the graphic novel of the same title by Marjane, as it recounts in autobiographical terms, the growing pains of the author in a world that had undergone tremendous change in the last few decades.Yes, not many films take on the political and social context of Iran head on, and what more doing so in very acute, straightforward, no holds barred terms. But it doesn't just seek to pass callous judgement or sought the easy way out to slam everything about the restrictive standard of living. Rather, it's a long hard look at the oppression and changes for the relative worse, and summarizes quite succinctly the turmoil that its ordinary citizenry had to endure in their day to day lives, but yet, always have that glimmer of hope to cling onto, and the joys of taking pleasure in the simple things in life.The story is told through the perspective of author Marjane Satrapi from the time she's a young child, and life as she knew back then forms the baseline where changes are measured against. For the first act, we're treated to a summary of the historical events that took place in the late 70s revolution, and the euphoric sentiments that came with it, before reality set in, and religious fervour take centerstage. We follow Marjane as she grows up and we partake in the later acts where her life abroad is filled with the expected cultural shocks, and becomes a tale about the remembering of one's roots.Strangely enough and here's where the kudos go to, is that Persepolis never, at any moment, felt like it was preaching from a soap box, nor is heavy handed in its treatment of politics and religion. Its allowance for comedy was extremely generous, with cheeky lines thrown in and thank goodness too for her Grandma who's a constant chicken soup for the soul, her bawdy sense of humour and subtle sarcasm never far away, and to whom the references of the Jasmine flower belongs to. But it's not all lighthearted laughter, as when the time calls for tension, you'll feel just as panicky as the Iranians when the morality police come aknocking at one's door, in their obsessive attempts to weed out decadent western influences, which often defies simple social logic to the likes of you and me. As my friend put it, it's blatant hypocrisy on display.And for it to be nominated for Best Animated Film in the upcoming Oscar awards does give Persepolis a vote of confidence in its art department, but naturally without a doubt for its strong, engaging storyline as well. The movie is almost devoid of colours as it's spent recollecting the past, and despite it being just in black and white, it's still simply gorgeous to look at. The lighting and shadow play worked wonders, and the slick editing and transitions make Persepolis deserving of a second viewing. I thought that for its subject matter, animation would probably be the way to go because there will be expected problems to shooting scenes in country, especially for authenticity purposes. But with animation done right, one can probably get away with stylistic license taken.Highly recommended, and not to be missed especially if you're an animation fan, or are yearning for an excellent piece of storytelling."
51,Persepolis,10,3 February 2008,"smashingly funny and disarmingly astute (and tragic) tale of growing up, girl or otherwise","It's a tricky thing to do a coming-of-age film without pouring over the sentimentality. Sometimes it's all a matter of the sense of humor, enriching the lines of the totally terrifying feeling of ""growing up without a clue what to do"" with the protagonist. With Persepolis, the background of the Iranian war and even growing up in a state of ""terror"" (or, for a big chunk, feeling the guilt of being away from one's home as this goes on), isn't necessarily the main focus.It's much more universal in essential terms, which is why I as a 23 year old white guy connected with it practically as strongly as I did to the quintessential coming-of-age film The 400 Blows. It's about someone young trying to carve out what the hell place they'll have in society, for themselves and how to make sense of the BS that amounts around everyone in living up to expectations, staying true to family, or just to live on and not crawl up into a total ball. Persepolis's hero is a little girl who grows up, starting in 1978 Tehran going through 1992, and sees socio-political strife in its extreme, lives as someone who is relegated among all women to be second class citizens, and becomes attached to- and sees- people die right in her family and circle of friends. And she has to still cope with being a girl, then a teen girl, and finally a young adult.It's all the more harrowing because Marjane Satrapi, the author of the original comics and the basis for the tale, goes for three things: 1) she wants to stay true to a subjective (but potent) view of Iranian society, of the impact of the war and the Shah and a existential crisis coming this way and that, 2) while doing this she puts in little stinging bars of satire, with Marjane as an adolescent donning ""Punk is Not Ded"" on her back and sneakers, the ""puppet"" presentation with the story of the Shah, and other smaller touches that come at surprising moments, and 3) enlivening it with an animation technique that's simple in characterization (smiles drawn with small lines, contours very concrete), but with the abstractions, the things that make animation ""Pop"", she makes some distinct, cool challenges to stir the pot (just watch when Marjarie and the other girls run from some cops after a party is busted, a character doesn't make the jump, and the view stays on the moon and sky, straightforward like a kids book).And, as well as with these three, you get the bond between the little girl and her grandmother, and it's not contrived or with the granny some super-being of sentiment or too wacky (that's left to the woman in Vienna with the retard dog). She's a strong, cynical but surefire of principles that might be taken with the next generation in a country that is so blown to bits like Iran that saying ""stay true to yourself"" isn't simple proselytizing, it's sound advice from the demoralization in this world. I loved their scenes as pure character-driven bits, where another filmmaker might've overclouded this with the message of political strident.This isn't to say Satrapi doesn't make her points through the medium. But it's all about this character, not simply her world. Her journey, her ups and downs, her morale lowered and raised, her sense of humor and scathing sense of decency tested, if only for her own sanity. It might seem delirious to make any kind of comedy out of the Iran/Iraq conflict, but Persepolis handles this better than any movie I've seen this year (maybe only comparable to Juno, where teen pregnancy was given the spunky beat of human wit). Through Iron Maiden bootlegs, deaths in the family, bad boyfriends in Vienna, homelessness, and her ""Eye of the Tiger"" tribute in her own personal resurrection, and then into a failed marriage, it's often very funny, surprisingly so. But then the right barbs of tragedy come in, folded in like a living, breathing graphic novel should.With great voice-work, a unique front of (lack of) color brought in, and as sharp a script I've seen in any animated or coming-of-age flick, it's a small, crucial testament to getting creative with a strange, oft terrible but personal surrounding."
52,Persepolis,6,27 December 2008,Good but I just don't understand why people raved about this,"The life of a young woman growing up before and after the revolution in Iran during the the late 1970's and early 1980's.Marjane Satrapi's animated version of her graphic novel left me scratching my head. Not because there is anything wrong with it, rather because the amount of praised heaped upon it I was certain the film was going to be a mind blowing experience. Don't get me wrong, its good, but I'm left to ponder why it achieved the acclaim it did. Perhaps its being a non-Japanese piece of ""adult"" animation had something to do with it.I do like it, as I like the graphic novel, which it translates beautifully to the motion picture screen, but I don't consider it one of the best."
53,Persepolis,6,15 October 2007,Saw it at NYFF really bad unreadable white on white subtitles.,"what i saw I liked , the animation was great and the story seemed good but could not read many of the subtitles since they were white on top of white background. This does a real disservice to the film and it's impact on the viewer. I just don't get it. the filmmaker and their team take extraordinary measures to make sure every detail and nuance of a film is just right to convey what the artist has to communicate. But when it comes to adding subtitles, they drop the ball and the film suffers for audiences that don't speak the language. Doesn't anyone take note, are they actually attempting to read it themselves?. It would be so ,easy to fix. Use yellow letters or white ones outlined in black.I mean everyone is always crying that there is no market for foreign films in the USA, but they are alienating the few that still want to see them. Believe me I am not alone in this complaint. I have heard from numerous people about it. Where are the producers that are trying to make a money from the films? Take note this might help. In terms of Peresepolis, it ruined the film experience for me and I would not recommend it unless you spoke French. You could tell there was perhaps a great film there but way too frustrating and distracting to pay complete attention to."
54,Persepolis,8,22 February 2011,An emotional education movie with artistic and philosophical touches,"This movie attracted me because of its original black and white expressionism style and the topic of Iran's recent history. The flick has autobiographical influences and tells the story of a young girl growing up in a country filled with tension, shattered by war and disintegrated by many revolutions and changing governments.The movie shows us the happy sides of the life of an innocent child, the tragical sides of a young girl leaving her country in despair, the courageous side as the girl fights for her dreams and her freedom, the philosophical and moral sides as she meets many old and wise personalities and learns a lot about Islam and Catholic religion, anarchy and communism, disco music and heavy metal, the melancholic sides as she faces death and isolation and the sides of uncertainty in the very end.The movie is highly educational and very interesting from a cultural and historical point of view but the main force are its vivid characters that are precisely and with much feeling becoming alive in this ""avantgarde"" comic strap. There are lot of details and emotions in this movie and it is sometimes hard to digest and pretty much filled within its running time of about one hour and half. There is no moment when I found this movie boring or difficult to follow.One the negative side, some people that don't know anything about the Iran may be confused by some names and events so that the public of the movie might be somewhat limited due to this factor. I also think that the movie is somewhat too educational and has too many propagandist touches but that doesn't destroy the pleasure of drowning into a different world through this open-minded and very interesting movie."
55,Persepolis,10,23 February 2010,"Cartoon it may be, but childish it is certainly not. *Spoilers!*","This is a cartoon, but don't be fooled by the medium that this work is presented in. This is a serious, but well-made and humorous and touching story of Marjane Satrapi's life. The movie starts out as Marjane as an adult, trying to go back to Iran but failing. Intermittently between chunks of the movie we see Marjane smoking and contemplating, perhaps about her life and the dangers that her parents face--or maybe if they're alive. The rest follow her from childhood to adulthood.Marjane is a curious, sometimes wild and reckless, but kindhearted kid. Growing up in the revolution of Iran is confusing, and as a kid she is confused about the politics that the grown-ups always talk about. Uncle Anoush's tale of being in jail intrigues her, but soon she learns that the revolution and war is nothing quite like she thought and learns values. She finds that, when the Shah has been removed from the throne and Iraq is fighting against Iran, life is changed. She now has to wear a veil, is under a very oppressive government, and because of her somewhat rebellious personality, is always getting herself into trouble. Her parents, out of concern, send Marjane at the age of 13 to Vienna, Austria. Over there, she manages to meet a bunch of misfit kids, but she's constantly reminded of how badly her family has it and how different life is in Vienna. Finally, she manages to fit in a little better, and after pursuing a gay love interest, she finds Markus. She's in love... And she snaps out of it when she finds that he's having an affair with another girl. Due to a bunch of factors, she becomes homeless, and after two months of living on the streets, she finally returns home to Iran. No questions asked. But back in Iran and feeling an outcast, she falls into a deep depression--and luckily, she manages to struggle out of it. She takes university courses, meets Reza and gets married to him, all the while going through episodes that teaches her how to survive Iran and go about it in the right way. All this time, she's helped by her ass-kicking, spunky and cool Grandma, who sternly scolds her or gives a bit of humor when she needs it. Finally, because of the danger in Iran, she decides to go to France. She lives there as an adult. The black-and-white medium and the style of the drawings convey a sense of universality and, in the more impactful scenes, give it more weight and atmosphere. The sense of universality is mostly conveyed by the choice to not go to realism. By having ""no"" skin color, one stops thinking about the ethnicity and instead focuses on their personality, their environment and their troubles. They are just like any other person, you and I, race aside. An example as to how the medium conveys atmosphere and weight is when the armies start marching in through the gas. The white gas floating through the scene, with the stark contrast of the shadowed revolutionaries and the gas- masked army, is eerie. And when a boy dies with blood flowing out of him, the black and white gives the moment a sort of feel and power that would be lost in color. Color is only reserved for special moments--moments when she is an adult. The characters are all unique and memorable. I have to give thanks to Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve, and whoever else (I can't remember off the top of my head) is involved in the voice-overs. They do a great job of doing the voices and conveying their personality strongly. Especially the grandma, who's a certainly special and butt-kicking one. No, this it not a political commentary or a history film, for those of you that complain that the history is vague and brief or biased. This is through the eyes of Marjane, not an objective view of Iran's history and the West's involvement. This is, above all, a story. There are a lot of other things I could talk about, but it's rather late and the review's getting long. I recommend that everyone see the movie. It's worth it."
56,Persepolis,10,5 February 2010,"film review, written by a 10th grade","Teheran 1978: The little girl Marjane dreams of being prophet. Since her relatives – and especially her grandma – are relatively liberal-minded, she follows the political events in her country with great interest. Those events finally lead to the dethronement of the Shah. With the creation of an Islamic republic, revolutionary guardians gain power. Marjane’s family doesn't accept the new circumstances – she dreams of being a revolutionary. The consequences of the war against Iraq can be seen soon: destruction, bombings, violence and a lack of food are part of the daily life in Iran. Depression in the own country increases every day. As Marjane’s political views become a problem for her family, her parents decide to take her to Austria in order to protect her. In Vienna, Marjane experiences her second revolution at the age of 14: puberty, liberty, love but also exile and problems concerning integration and the differences between the two countries.Because the whole film is drawn like a cartoon strip, the political situation, especially at the beginning of the film, can easily be understood. The story is based on the real life of Marjane Satrapi, so the film starts with the little Marjane as well: the viewer will first see everything with the eyes of the young Marjane, later as she grows up, she (and the viewer as well) will become aware of the brutality, the crimes and the violence of the war Iraq-Iran and of the revolution, since some of her relatives had been arrested and killed by the government. Again, the cartoon-style film helps to hide most of the scenes with too much violence. My advice for everyone who is interested in the Iranian culture and problems is to watch that film."
57,Persepolis,8,23 December 2008,A Breath Of Fresh Air For Animated Features...,"Winning the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2007 and even getting a surprising Oscar nod in the Best Animated Feature category, PERSEPOLIS is more of a dramatic biography of one girl's life as she runs away from her country and her Iranian heritage.Most Americans are probably used to animated films being light, funny, or a combination of the two (thinking along the lines of FINDING NEMO). But Persepolis isn't even in the same ballpark.The animation is cruder, with thick, black lines indicating the strict black and white laws of Iran during the Islamic Revolution that rocked the nation. No 3-dimensions here either. But the austere coloring and 2-dimensional representations are an integral part of the story.The story follows the real-life history of its creator, Marjane Satrapi, who grew up during Iran's tumult and the battles incurred while trying to find its identity. Marjane, too, tries to find herself, and often latches onto the world around her, until family and friends teach her the horrors of past, present, and probably future.The audience grows up with Marjane, learning the ways of the outside world while watching Iran implode. Alone and lost in a world that doesn't understand her, Marjane must learn to live her life while worrying about what's happening back home (she leaves Iran at the behest of her parents and travels around Europe, going to school and working odd jobs).The gripping story is told all from Marjanes point of view, making the viewer care tremendously about this young girl as she creeps into womanhood. We feel her aches and pains as she tries to understand the world around her but keeps getting stymied by her upbringing and her terrible losses back in Iran.I do have to warn potential viewers, though, that this animation holds back nothing. The language, the wars, sex, drugs, it's all there, and Marjane experiences all of them in their great and terribleness. That being said, this is a breath of fresh air in terms of what most audiences think of as an animated feature. It'll surprise you again and again."
58,Persepolis,8,2 March 2008,Beautifully moving,"Persepolis is a beautiful and moving story; brilliantly told with eye-pleasing, stylish, animation.I was tentative about seeing this one because of its heavy subject matter, but the filmmakers handled the story, about the decades-long conflict in Iran, with a light and often humorous touch. The success of which, was due in large part, because the story was told through the eyes of a young girl.The movie was most compelling when it focused on your young protagonists' life in Iran but seemed to lose focus somewhat in the latter half as it turned into an Iranian version of ""My So-Called Life"" that, though still entertaining, lost a lot of the first act's urgency. But I highly recommend Persepolis, as it gives voice to the lives of those affected by conflict in the Middle East--a side many Americans are not often used to seeing.8/10"
59,Persepolis,,29 February 2008,A work of art,"""Persepolis"" is a visual delight, a thought-provoking, powerfully moving real story of an Iranian girl (Marjane Satrapi) and an entire nation divided by war and intolerance during the hard times of the Islamic Revolution. Satrapi wrote the acclaimed, autobiographical novel ""Persepolis"" in 2000, and co-directed this film adaptation with Vincent Paronnaud. Chiara Mastroianni voices Marjane, her real life mother (and French icon) Catherine Deneuve voices Marjane's mother, and Danielle Darrieux (""8 Women"") is responsible for the voice of Marjane's fascinating grandmother, an unlikely heroine in her life. Satrapi is never self-indulgent or over the top, and tells her story with honesty, visual creativity and peculiar humor. ""Ratatouille"" won the Best Animated Feature Oscar in a race that was similar to 2003's ""Finding Nemo"" vs. ""The Triplets of Belleville"" (although, in that case, Nemo was actually better), that is, popular, cute animation versus European animation for grown-ups. ""Ratatouille"" was adorable, but if originality counted, ""Persepolis"" would've won. 10/10."
60,Persepolis,9,28 February 2008,Range of emotions and awesome characters,"I'm only going to set myself up to be severely disappointed when I state that this film may just be the big example as to why animation isn't necessarily a children's entertainment endeavor, but it really should be. Marjane Satrapi's famous graphic novel gets its own silver-screen adaptation of the story of a precocious Iranian girl who grows up during the revolution that disposed the Shah, only to experience the increase of intolerance and theocracy so that she is eventually sent West and has to deal with her simultaneously Middle-Eastern and Western identity.This movie is great in that it can move from sad to funny, depressing to ironic, ecstatic to reserved practically without a breath in between. Mostly, it's very honest and straight-forward, but it's also willing to feature the occasional ""Eye of the Tiger"" music video. The animation ranges from lovely to gorgeous, and sometimes dabbles in color, which is interesting. But mostly it's just good voice-performances and line delivery by a plethora of characters that feel real and understandable despite their animated removal from realism.--PolarisDiB"
61,Persepolis,8,5 December 2012,A very well-crafted work of art,"The first time I watched Persepolis it was a joy to see something refreshingly different that was so informative, entertaining and moving. It really does stand out as a very well-crafted work of art. The story of Marjane's younger years is interesting enough, but the highly-stylized delivery of the (mostly) black & white animation gives an added dimension that transforms the film from brilliant to classic. It's quite fast-paced from the start and there is no time wasted on ponderous scenes. In fact, I would go so far as to insist that a second viewing is necessary to fully take it all in. It would give a false impression to describe Persepolis as 'educational' but it certainly is eye-opening and the times during which Marjane grew up are pretty historical. However, the background of the politics and the unfolding of the Iran-Iraq war are explained in a fairly simplified manner that fits well with the story being told from the perspective of a young girl. By the end of the film I found myself feeling very much more informed on Iranian history and also having a new-found respect for the people who live there. But it's also the story of Marjane finding her place in the world and remaining true to herself, which transcends the setting and could be applicable to anyone, anywhere, at any time. The pace slows down towards the end, which is a little unfortunate, but I guess it ties in nicely with Marjane growing up and moving on. The ultimate clincher for me was that I didn't want the film to finish and felt sad when it finally ground to a halt. Persepolis should never be dismissed as just a cartoon about Iran; it's so much more than that and should be seen by as many people as possible. I would also recommend the DVD 'making of' extras; it was very interesting to see Marjane herself talking about creating the film and to discover quite how much work goes into making it look (and sound) so good!"
62,Persepolis,10,9 April 2011,Beautiful in Animation and Beautiful in Spirit,"This is an amazing and unique film for many reasons. The animation is beautifully done in black and white, reminding one of Max Fletcher's Superman cartoons. The film's narrative is a wonderfully personal account of life in Iran during and after the 1978 Revolution. It works on a purely aesthetic level as beautiful animation and it works on a political level to help us understand life under a savage religious dictatorship.The extras on the DVD are wonderful. We get to see Catherine Deneuve looking as beautiful as ever at Cannes and we get to see the amazing Daniel Darrieux doing the important part of the grandmother. Having seen Darrieux at the age of twenty-one in ""Rage of Paris"" (1938) with Douglas Fairbanks Jr., it was great to see her at age 90 doing the part of the grandmother. The great love of life and sense of humor was still evident in her. Note that the equally amazing Gena Rowland played the grandmother part for the English version.This is a beautiful film that shows that all people of all nations are really the same and want the same things. It is a tribute to the humanist spirit of rebellion and tells us that the harshest religious regimes will never crush truth no matter how many communists and revolutionaries they torture or kill."
63,Persepolis,9,1 March 2011,A perfect (adult) animated film; mature and well-told.,"**** out of ****Animated films are always so interesting, no only because of their often times thrilling visuals, but also because of their ability to intoxicate us in their whimsy. I thought that I knew what a great animated film was, but upon watching ""Persepolis"" I can officially say that I know. This is one of the best animated films I have ever seen. Emotionally resonant, timely in its narrative, and beautiful in its power. This is indeed a very artistic triumph for both foreign animation and the world of animation in general. Here we have a film that makes many bold statements whilst covering quite a few tough subjects, yet it never looses its daring yet endearing appeal. It's so daring that it might even come across as depressing and boring to some. ""Persepolis"" is a unique animated gem indeed; but perhaps it's one that is only meant to be loved by a select few. I'm one of those select few. I absolutely loved ""Persepolis"", and it is what I believe to be one of the best films of 2007. Animation is always stunning and often times even a bit tedious (looking at you Dreamworks), but ""Persepolis"" sheds the clichéd skin that it should bear. It's a new kind of animated beast, and it even gives 2007's ""Ratatouille"" a run for its money. And I LOVED ""Ratatouille"". So that's saying something when another animated film from the same year can even have a chance at beating ""Ratatouille"" when it comes to winning the big animated Oscar. I don't know if ""Persepolis"" is better than ""Ratatouille"", but without comparing the two, I can tell you that it's absolutely positively worth your time. The film does to animation what hasn't been done before; give it a daring flavor that never goes overboard with content but never underachieves when it comes to style and substance. This is an animated film that has more than just unique and stunning visuals; it also has an emotional core. It's a film about a girl who grew up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution and how such a catastrophic event affected the rest of her life. Some will call it depressing and empty; but you know what, I call it powerful and touching. As long as you can get past the often times intentionally grim style of the film, then you're in for a treat unlike any you've ever seen. If not for the story, then perhaps ""Persepolis"" is worth seeing for its visuals, which seem to have this unfailing ability to amaze. There's something about ""Persepolis"" that I just haven't seen before. Half of the fun will be finding out just what that is; and the rest will be thinking even more about the actual film. I was, as one would say, riveted.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/721884/reviews/?search=persepolis"
64,Persepolis,10,8 November 2010,girl's life in revolutionary Iran,"I had never heard of Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel ""Persepolis"" until the movie of the same name came out. Maybe that's better, since it gave the movie more impact. The movie is Satrapi's memory of growing up in 1980s Iran, and how the country changed after Khomeini came to power and turned the nation into an Islamic republic. Since it's a cartoon, that enables some very interesting scenes (namely Satrapi's literal coming-of-age).But most importantly, the movie shows what became of the land once known as Persia, and in particular how British manipulation of the monarchy led up the revolution. Worse still, Khomeini executed a number of the military leaders, leaving the country vulnerable to Saddam Hussein's 1980 invasion. I had heard how Khomeini's regime was incompetent when it came to protecting the Iranian people from the Iraqi invasion; the government was more obsessed with making people follow Khomeini's interpretation of the Koran than with the people's well-being. It would have never come to this had the CIA not overthrown the prime minister in 1953 and cemented the shah's despotic rule. The riots after the disputed 2009 election can also be traced to this.All in all, this is definitely one that I recommend. Featuring the voices of Catherine Deneuve, Chiara Mastroianni (Deneuve's daughter), Sean Penn and Iggy Pop."
65,Persepolis,8,16 October 2010,The story of how a girl and a country longs to be free,"Based on a celebrated graphic novel, Persepolis is a film that brings its source material through animation.Persepolis is the auto-biographical account of Marjane Satrapi as she grew up during the Iranian Revolution. Starting in 1978 Iran is the middle of a political crisis with people wanting to bring down the Shah. Marji (Gabrielle Lopes Benites (child)/Chiara Mastroianni (adult)), is a 9-year-old who idealises Bruce Lee, wishes to become a prophet and terrorises a local child whom father is a brutal government official. She also loves her parents who are political activities (Simon Abkarian and Catherine Deneuve), her grandmother (Danielle Darrieux) and uncle (François Jerosme) who was political prisoner for being a communist. But when Ayatollah Khomeini takes over Iran everything becomes worst with the regime becoming more repressive, with women forced to wear the veil, political prisoners are executed, the nation is at war with Iraq and the shops are empty. Marji becomes active in counter-culture, buying bootleg Iron Maiden tapes, wear a denim jacket and questions her teachers before being sent to Austria to for her own safety.Persepolis is a powerful story that is both a dramatic and emotional story and a comic and surreal tale. The animation style is simple but it works in the context of the film, allowing for some cut scenes for comic reasons, as well as showing the history and events of Iran. The black and white style worked well with the context of the film, showing the dark times that Marji grew up. Persepolis is a really interesting film about how a child would see how the world in the middle of turmoil, her innocent dreams and belief in God and Marxism compared to the harsh reality of life. She grows into counter-culture to the facing prejudice in Europe. The film shows how you can resist in a harsh reality, through party, making moonshine and going into Western counter-culture. Persepolis shows how some young European young people are pretentious, thinking they are cool by ripping into other subgroups, listening to music they possibly don't like and complaining about politics, capitalism and how it all does not really manner. Marji's intelligences shows the hypocrisy of the Islamic regime throughout her live, how she is a permanent outsider and how a young girl/woman longs to be free.Persepolis is a story about growing and the writer directors Vincent Paronnaud and Satrapi do show with great effect the impact of the revolution and the war, the pointless nature of the Iran-Iraq war, the politics and society of Iran and most importantly the personal and human drama involving Marji and her family. I also like how the nuns in Austria were drawn in a similar style to the religious Iranian female enforcers, with Marji swapping one religious regime for another.An excellent film."
66,Persepolis,8,16 July 2010,Insightful look into Modern history of Iran,"Persepolis is based off of the 2003 graphic novel (or series of graphic novels) released under the same name, written by the film's director, Marjane Satrapi. Both entities are memoirs of the authors time in revolutionary Iran and the culture differences between there and western Europe. The book is one of my favorites, so I went to this film with very high hopes.The film succeeds in many things. It is visually one of the most impressive films I have ever seen. It is almost entirely in black and white, sometimes only black, and very...arty. It is amazing to look at, almost more amazing than watching the film. It feels very much like the graphic novel in that sense, but uses the film medium wonderfully, expanding on the already distinctive style.The Soundtrack is amazing. 'nuff said.And the individual scenes are amazing. The dialog is normally well done, the Voice acting is above average, and the scenes are very good at depicting the life in Iran before and after the revolution.The film had One problem.the plot didn't amount to squat.The memoir spanned many years and many different journeys, and being based in real life, it lacks a real plot arc. There is no conclusion, rising or falling action for the overall stories. There are 3 acts to it (pre revolution, Europe, Post revolution), and each part has there own arc, but overall...It doesn't amount to a whole lot, other than showing you what life is like for a non religious Iranian in both Iran and Europe.this was what the author set out to do, but it is not optimal in the movie setting, and makes the film feel incomplete in some wayOverall, however, this film was really good, and definitely a recommendation to anyone liking political films or cartoons.4/5Check out more observations at albobthinks.blogspot.com"
67,Persepolis,10,14 June 2010,Great even for those who haven't read the original graphic novel,"I really wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, a really fine movie. Whilst being set in Iran it's a much broader look at the concept of homeland and identity, and living under oppression. This sort of stuff, without negating it's importance, is pretty fashionable at the moment, and to be honest I was expecting the movie to be a fairly pedestrian celebration of Western political and moral freedoms, which in some ways it was. But it was also fully aware of the bond one has with one's own country and values, and it was discerning in its evaluation of Western culture as a kind of receptacle for rejected or marginalized persons, which offers freedom and anonymity, along with the negative things that go with it. Its look at state-sponsored and enforced religion was both critical and funny. It's a film bursting with strong intelligent women and it gently expressed some important ideas about both about Iran and the West. And it looks great too. Great scene with God and (is it?) Karl Marx."
68,Persepolis,8,9 June 2010,Wonderfully drawn and personal,"Brilliantly animated, 'Persepolis' tells the story of what it's like to be an ordinary woman whose life is ruined by dictatorship. Specifically, it's the autobiographical story of a middle class Iranian living under the theocracy of the Islamic government. Aside from the animation, what's good about this film is that its heroine is not especially cute, brave or talented - and it gives us a very unromanticised portrait of life. What's less good is the fact that the movie never really explores what lies behind the ascendancy of the clerics; why ordinary people, from less liberal households than the writers', lend their support to such a repressive regime in a country that was once apparently wholly modern. That remains a mystery - the arbitrary cruelty of life under it does not."
69,Persepolis,9,28 December 2008,Changed my opinion of animations,"This animated autobiographical film follows the life journey of director Satrapi. Born in 1969 she spent her youth in Tehran, her adolescence in Vienna, her college days back in Iran, then emigrated to France. She has been a witness to a lot of history: from life under the Shah, to the Iran revolution and the first years of the eight year Iran/Iraq war, and to the repression of the Ayatollahs. I found that there was some history to be learned here, and I doubt I am alone in that--if I had been asked to sketch the experiences of a woman in Satrapi's situation, I would not have come up with anything near the truth. She is an independent minded person who had a comfortable youth, but found herself increasingly at odds with a repressive society and found the need to escape. At the heart of the story is the distressing conflict she faces in wanting to be close to her parents and grandmother while wanting to live a life without having to conform to strict rules. She is not a political activist but rather a person trying to resolve personal ideals in the context of political realities. I imagine being estranged from your homeland is not at all easy and this is captured in the opening scenes where Satrapi, sitting in Orly Airport, somewhat sadly muses on her past.In general I have little patience for animation--could not make it beyond the trailers for ""Shrek"" or ""Toy Story."" However this unique movie has forever changed my appreciation for the genre. Many of the images are worthy of framing and hanging. And the animation allows for freedoms not available to real life filming--how could you have a quick cut to the protagonist talking to God and Karl Marx? And much action can be compressed into a few seconds, like a hasty group retreat into the basement during a bombing. There are some interesting super-impositions too, like when Satrapi is sitting and thinking about the past and her young self comes bouncing across the screen. Also the music and excellent sound effects add much.It would be interesting to see an attempt to tell this story with real sets and actors; I bet it would not be nearly as effective."
70,Persepolis,9,16 November 2008,Epic Drama,"Persepolis follows the story of young Marjane Satrapi, the only daughter of an educated Teheran couple who travels through an epic journey of political struggle, Western idealization, religious fanaticism, teenage angst, alienation and depression, and ultimately self-discovery. The verfremdungseffekt principle is apparent in how the story is delivered to the viewer: it is broken into a series of short sketches, each which highlight a particular moment in Marjane's life, and each closing with a theatrical fade-out. The audience is constantly aware of the film's dream-like quality, not just because it is an animated piece, but more so because the characters are involved with impossible situations in order to dramatize a special emotion. For example, when Marjane falls in love with a boy in Vienna, she is seen driving through the streets with him; only they aren't drivingthey're flying through the street. This idea emphasizes the rapture of first love syndrome, and though theatrical it may be, it still is effective and gets the point across.Although the story is set in contemporary times, it has the Brechtian element of historicity; it feels as though there is a timeless quality threaded within its nature simply because there is so much character development and time spent with Marjane's life unfolding. The struggles she faces are the same struggles that humans have faced since the beginning. In this respect, the story seems to challenge the prevailing cultural idea of integrityintegrity to one's cultural beliefs, religious convictions, race and identity. Marjane's reality stabilizer is her grandmother, who, in essence, teaches her that integrity is a refusal to sabotage her identity. Marjane struggles to embrace her grandmother's ideal because she is confronted with more immediate pressuressocial acceptance from her peers. In one scene she lies to a boy about her racial identity in order to prevent critical slanders on how her country is a group of fanatical terrorists. She becomes ashamed of her heritage and who she is, but is reminded by her grandmother that it is better to be who you are than to be a liar. The argument the film seems to make is that people ought to be who they are and say what they feel, because those that mind don't matter, and those that matter don't mind."
71,Persepolis,9,10 October 2008,"Politics and identity are the film's driving force, although is smartly perfunctory in making each of them not the cause or the effect.","Inspired from Marjane Satrapi's graphic novels, ""Persepolis"" is a cinematic tour de force. Beautifully conceived and written, it never pulls punches as it chronicles the adventures of its protagonist while being able to display certain truths that have never been produced in a more digestible fashion. Even if the film is in black and white, ideas nevertheless go though the entire spectrum, with emphasis on integrity, courage and character: virtues that usually suffer in an incarcerating environment.Divided in three acts, film follows Marjane Satrapi as she navigates through an oppressive environment, in both Iran and Austria, while on the lookout for her identity and self worth. As opposed to this year's ""Waltz with Bashir"", an animated political documentary, ""Persepolis"" is definitely a production of fiction and does not frame reality verbatim, however it paints a picture to Satrapi's personal experiences as close as possible. Politics and identity are the film's driving force, although is smartly perfunctory in making each of them not the cause or the effect.Each frame is beautiful to look at and has definitely gone above and beyond its comic book counterpart. Using hand drawn techniques and a sense of whimsy missing from mechanical mainstream animated features, ""Persepolis"" cements that story is essential as an axis in storytelling. With a mainly black and white palette, the picture is nevertheless colorful with its depiction of characters, all of them inspiring and definitely breaks taboos on a stereotypical view of Persian living.To contrast the film and its graphic novel roots is made redundant by its production, as it's conscious to steer clear from recreating the panels as is. Film is more cinematic in approach and fully takes advantage of its use of music and color. As opposed to the novel's more linear story telling, ""Persepolis"" follows a mainly flashback driven narrative which further emphasizes main protagonist's faint sense of nostalgia. Music is also used to much effect, as sequences involving popular music will be marked as a highlight, clearly in absentia from the novel. The overall effect is interesting: both mediums become more complementary rather than a substitute.Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, ""Persepolis"" definitely establishes a lasting experience. It knows how to balance its political influence and its personality that it never becomes overbearing and driven by a vendetta. The film's universal appeal is exceptional as even if it goes through specifics about Iran's historical political development, narrative is still driven by its protagonist. And with a character like Marjane, who has been easily compared to Juno multiple times, she's definitely worth cheering for."
72,Persepolis,8,5 October 2008,Touching,"Maybe some 7.5/10 on personal scorecard. A really touching and auto-biographical story of the last 40 years of Iran history. A simply 2D black and white animation with a good story, a good plot and a good screenplay. It is not a ""light"" movie. You should be prepared for something ""heavy"" before sitting to show this movie. Anyway there a good narrative tone and a good rhythm. Only in the second part the rhythm slows down a bit but not too much. It is never boring. And it never plays and insists on pain and sentimentalism to cause sadness in the viewer. It doesn't need millions of dollars to make a good movie if you have something to say and take a bit of care in how to tell it."
73,Persepolis,8,3 August 2008,This movie is about what will happens if Lisa Simpsons was born in Iran..,"There is one saviour to year'07, and that is PERSEPOLIS. This brilliant movie combines the fun meter created by its animation and a strong message about living in Iran.The story is about Marjane Satrapi's live. She is an Iranian girl who grow up in a intelligent western-minded family. She grew up in the time of so called ""Islamic Revolution"" in Iran, then the war between Iran and Iraq. To escape the war, she is sent by her parents to Austria. After studying there, she came back to Iran and faced the new regime, the Islamic regime which totally anti-emancipation and feminism.The story maybe sound too boring for most brainless movie-goers who just expect some action stunts and exploding cars. That's when the brilliance of Vincent Paronnaud comes in. He successfully tell the ""political"" story and makes it totally enjoyable. It's just like watching other animated movie like Lion King with some political message inside it.The animation itself is very-very unique.. The film tells some political incidents from a girl point of view. The movie really capture Marjane's struggle within herself, how she tries to defend her integrity as an intelligent human being,in the anti-feminist Islam world in a very comical fashion so it's watchable for everyone without being a really racist film."
74,Persepolis,8,22 July 2008,An eye-opening experience.,"A very unique style of animation along with a more serious and darker story and tone lend itself well to this one of a kind film. Marjane is full of life, high spirited and often times down right hilarious, she gives us as the audience an honest look into her, her life and a glimpse into what life is really like in modern day Iran. I find it amazing how our perceptions of a place and what it is really like can be so very very different. Also to see how other cultures see ours and how they embrace it or in some cases reject it and why. The film pushes the boundaries of subject matter in a animated film and in some cases the animated representation of an event can bring more emotion then a live action one can. I love that such simple animation can be so original and at times look so beautiful."
75,Persepolis,8,22 July 2008,Fascinating Look at an Iranian Girl's Transformative Journey,"Hand-drawn animation, especially simple black-and-white drawings, is so rare to see on the big screen that one has to appreciate the emotional nakedness that Marjane Satrapi and her fellow cartoonist Vincent Paronnaud bring to this 2007 fictionalized memoir of Satrapi's formative years as the free-spirited daughter in a liberal Iranian family. The 95-minute film follows the same abstract style found in her best-selling autobiographical graphic novel, adding color for the present-day scenes and using a shadow theater approach to the historical sequences. The cumulative effect works well within the context of the story's volatile emotional changes as it alternates in quicksilver fashion between poignant, funny and harrowing. The film reminds me a bit of Mark Forster's adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's ""The Kite Runner"", which also has a protagonist forced to live in exile due to the advent of war and tyranny. The difference is that Satrapi's family stayed in Tehran throughout the turmoil brought on by the Shah's overthrow, the oppressive fundamentalist regime that followed, and the Iran-Iraq war. Some of this comes across as a bit muddled, but the propulsive narrative drive and empathetic voice characterizations compensate greatly.The plot flashes back to Marjane's childhood in Iran during the 1970's as she gradually begins to understand how her family has been mistreated and imprisoned due to their Communist leanings under the Shah. Once the Islamic Revolution deposes of the Shah in 1979, the family faces even more persecution by the new government. Forced to wear a burqa, Marjane has an escalating desire to express her individuality through listening to heavy rock music and questioning authority at every turn. During the 1980's, Marjane's parents decide to send their daughter to Austria to continue her education since Iran was becoming a political hotbed with the oncoming Iran-Iraq war promising even greater horrors. In he meantime, Marjane never fits into Viennese student life, and her situation worsens with a series of bad romantic relationships. She ends up on the streets, and her desperation becomes such that she returns home to Iran. Falling into a crevasse between Western and Eastern cultures, Marjane falls into a depression until she faces up to her true fate. What Satrapi and Paronnaud do especially well is make the animated Marjane's journey a universal one that gives personalized insights into the current challenges facing the Middle East.The 2008 DVD offers both the original French and English-dubbed versions of the feature. The filmmakers recruited quite a cast of voices to inhabit the characters, including Chiara Mastroianni as Marjane, her mother Catherine Deneuve as Marjane's mother, and another legend, Danielle Darrieux as Marjane's feisty grandmother. Deneuve and Darrieux played mother-and-daughter in Jacques Demy's candy-coated musical, ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" over four decades earlier. On the English version, Mastroianni and Deneuve repeat their roles, but Gena Rowlands takes over for Darrieux. There are several other extras on the DVD, the chief one being a half-hour documentary in French, ""The Hidden Side of Persepolis"", which gives a highly detailed look at the production process. Satrapi and Paronnaud are interviewed extensively, as are several crew members and both the 91-year-old Darrieux and Mastroianni (a dead ringer for her father Marcello). There are two other pieces - a brief short, ""Behind-the-Scenes of Persepolis"", which focuses primarily on the English dubbing process with Rowlands and Iggy Pop, and a half-hour press conference held at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival with Satrapi, Paronnaud, the film's producers, as well as Mastroianni and Deneuve. There is no full-length directors' commentary track, but three scenes have individual subtitled commentary - Satrapi on the opening scene in color, Mastroianni on the amusing ""Eye of the Tiger"" scene, and Paronnaud on the establishing shots of Vienna. Particularly interesting are five other scenes where we are shown the storyboards versus the final animation."
76,Persepolis,8,12 May 2008,Persepolis is charming and beautiful... but needs improvement in some spots,"First of all don't worry the review contains minor spoilers and I will try not to say any major spoilers. But I will tell you the content of the film and some of the themes. Persepolis is about a girl that has to deal with situations like the war going on and as she grows older she stumbles in relationships, punk, and falling with the out crowd. But apparently there is a bit of humor that makes this enjoyable.Persepolis is really charming and I don't blame the critics for calling it 'The best of 2007'. Truly this was a masterpiece and it was really moving. It dealt with situations in the eyes of a child and then how she grows up and how her life turns out terrible. Especially in the ending. Although I couldn't give this 10 out of 10 because there are some slow spots. I thought the beginning started out really slow because all the time something was interesting and building up a climax it stayed that way. There is also a little humor that goes on here and there. But it's really hard to give this a PG-13 when it deals with issues about sex, drugs, and violence. Persepolis might not be the best film of a decade but it's enjoyable for about 90 minutes."
77,Persepolis,10,4 March 2008,"Same as Spiegelman's achievement with Maus, so did Marjane with Persepolis!","The similarities with Spiegelman's work Maus are clearly present in Persepolis, however; in a positive and distinctive way. Some of the similarities include the process and traumas from childhood to adulthood when surrounded by war along with friends and relatives directly involved in it. The artistic style is resembled in both comic books, and finally the distinctive aspect of immigration issues shown in Persepolis through Marjane makes one of the most subtle but nonetheless, very important one. The immigration aspect lived by Marjane allows one to compare with Spiegelman's dad Vladek in his Cul-De-Sac-no-mens-land situation, who suffered in a Poland invaded by the Nazis, and survived in the end. With Marjane it is as if the cat-mouse chase is transported into an internal labyrinthine mind game dwelling between being free without her self-identity, or living oppressed for being part of both worlds between East and West cultures. Beautiful up-to-date story! Creative and universal, funny and heartbreaking! This is a must see for all ages, all cultures, and it reaches the greatest purpose of any work of art, it breaks the barriers of language communicating with two of the most humane desires: to be happy and free!"
78,Persepolis,2,15 April 2008,witty propaganda yet do not let be fooled,"i will be honest and say i gave up on watching it somewhere mid-way and then fast forward with a few breaks. then i came back here and read many of the reviews already made....maybe is just me, and i can not help it, but this cartoon to north American society seems to have a purpose of ""lets save them from themselves"" and iraq comes to mind right away. it seems to me that this is a justification, or part of, for another invasion with ""good intentions"".the lady to me seems a self indulged person and i frankly got annoyed at her portrait of trying to raise pity and ""feel"" for her. well in this case this could never happen because, just like a history teacher has already mentioned here, i NEED to know how come her family was so wealthy above average, manage to keep that ( were they playing both sides maybe?)and send her to Paris!? now, if this would have been made after a poor girl's biography i could see myself having certain emotions. but as it stands + its release timing this is just pure propaganda movie; even worse, since its cartoon, it overplays the ""soft"" side of tings too well for its own good , in order to possibly be taken serious.besides there are those clichés regarding gays. well, a woman that fights toward winning her rights should not have at least some compassion for the underdogs of society just like her??? the message is obviously self indulgent from the view of a ruling class member.i only give it 2 stars because its production and related stuff. a propaganda movie obviously has interests in convincing-manipulating my thoughts and therefore generally is well done appealing to certain visual emotions that i can not deny i might have as well."
79,Persepolis,6,4 August 2007,By far too light about such a serious situation,"I was really expecting this film and I have finally seen it. It is one of the greatest disappointments I have lived in a movie-theater for quite a while, all the more because I was expecting a lot from it. The subject is too serious to be treated so lightly, yes lightly. What are her father and mother doing in Iran for them to have that much money, that comfort if not luxury, that durability that enables them to survive all regimes, all revolutions, all coup d'etat, when it is not simple religious putsches, and where did they get the money to enable her to live for several years in Vienna? The whole film becomes a collection of clichés, most of them purely existential. Let me give a couple. Cliché, the quotation of Lenin or Bakunin or some other names that bring nothing to the mind. Cliché, her boyfriend in Vienna who discovers he is gay and the relation is finished because of it: you have to be seriously concentrating on sex and only sex to make friends with someone and drop him as soon as he discovers himself unable to fulfill the sexual part of the relation. What about his personality, his originality? What about love and friendship in all that? Then the next one is seen in two directions and each one is a cliché: on one side he is a saint who ends up in bed with another girl; on the other side he is a monster who exploited the girl all along. She sure was a sucker and a dummy. But what does it bring to the film, to the story, to the ideas the film conveys, if it conveys any articulated idea? The point is not to say that the West sold weapons to both Iran and Iraq. That's normal since we are in a market economy and business is business: if I don't sell my weapons, my neighbor will sell his. So, what must I do? After all a French exocet missile was very effective in the Falkland Islands war in the 1980s  against the English. If Kellog refuses to sell his corn flakes to me, I will buy the corn flakes of any other brand. But what were the causes of this war? Why did Iran and Iraq manage to start a war between them two instead of finding a normal solution through discussions and negotiations? The film seems to express some kind of nostalgia for the good old days when there were two clear cut sides. Unluckily the old USSR has disappeared, but not one word about the support Iran provided, along with the CIA among others, to the anti-soviet fighters in Afghanistan. This film is simplistic but it deals with extremely important issues, so it does not have the right to be that simplistic. Politics cannot be reduced to that superficiality. And the future of Iran is not in Paris. It is Tehran.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"
80,Persepolis,,15 June 2011,Mediocre,"I hope my girlfriend isn't reading this.She was so taken by this movie that she spread her influence over me and now I have seen it as well. I have to admit I was pretty disappointed. This story of the life of an Iranian girl growing up into the oppression of her home country seems like it would be about that, but somehow this film manages to be about nothing despite so much going on. What it does succeed at is merging the story of a nations inner-struggle with a tender coming-of-age tale. You will find the beginning is full of stories of danger, heroism, and romantic notions of heroes and evil within the oppressive state. These elements should have retained the spotlight. Because the more the movie progresses, the more Marjane soaks up the narrative herself as we follow her on her aimless path. You will continue to follow her as she grows up and experiences all of the perfunctory nonsense that goes with it, and just as you start to wonder what's the point, you'll realize it's too late and that even if there is a point to be found, you've already lost over an hour to this shortsighted narrative.Although the political element is truly engaging, instead the majority of the focus is directed towards Marjane and how she feels about herself for most of the film. What results is a shamefully self-indulgent narrative, resonating the facade of genuine anguish and concern, which is only sympathetic posturing. Coupled with the touch of the pretentious attitude of a bleeding heart, it can be nauseating (this shows most when Marjane blows up at her new foreign friends). Indeed, the sheet of illusion is as thin as ice, and just as transparent. While I am actually reluctant to condemn this movie, I just find it hard to say good things about it. I would certainly be singing a different tune if I was a female viewer, because the film quite blatantly appeals towards women. The majority of the personal side of the film relates to womanhood, like puberty, maternity, love from a womans perspective, and a small deal of girl talk. As a man I wasn't that taken aback, even when men were slandered by the characters. It's only that when nothing else in terms of a structured plot is going on elsewhere, I have to ask, ""what's the POINT""? Of course the audience should be put on a personal level with the characters. But balance is important. Was Marjane as much or more important than the turmoil in her country, the central backdrop of the story? I don't think so, personally, and I think it's a shame she had to hog the spotlight. What's left of what could've been a much more important movie is a better-than-average chick flick, something like the Ya-Ya Sisterhood of the traveling war refuge. In all, the major flaw was a lack of plot. There is no discernible arc to follow, no direction, no point. And all the time throughout, Marjanes' insignificant self-distractions force our attention away as well and overshadow a far more interesting story."
81,Persepolis,10,24 February 2008,Masterpiece and Floods of Emoions,"This is a very poignant and deep story. While watching I was living through every minute of it, no matter the subtitles and its minimalistic style. I guess, thanks to the Japanese, the whole world is getting now that cartoons can be no less or even more serious, adult and ""live"" than movies with actors.And then I read in a review: ""Besides several tragic moments ""Persepolis"" never loses it's fine humor."" Come on, not several, it's ALL SO tragic (and without loosing the fine humor). That absurd horror of Iran-Iraq war, and little children living under bombs and getting to know how political prisoners are executed; and how all have to lie-lie-lie and live in fear in order to survive; and the girl's divided identity - she is foreigner everywhere, in her home Iran and in Europe; and how Europeans may think non-Europeans to be savage... Together with Marji's personal story, the movie is full of social and political messages that reveal how mercilessly history breaks people's lives. And how strong people can be, those who live through, and how they still keep their humor and do not forget to see the good side of life, which saves them and after all suffering makes them REAL."
82,Persepolis,2,19 May 2008,Persepolis is in need of a lot of work,"The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history. This movie bored me. It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots. Here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them. It comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties. Mind you, she is torn between cultures and doesn't have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real. She is listening to ever-so-many voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of Iran. The only thing I received from this movie was angst."
83,Persepolis,5,12 November 2010,"A comic book movie where nobody wears tights, but still a comic book movie.","This animated tale is adapted from a graphic novel of the same name and I can only hope that this story, told in this style, works much better on the printed page.More or less an autobiography of an Iranian woman named Marjane Satrapi, Persepolis starts with her as a young girl in the waning days of the Shah, follows her through the beginnings of the Islamic republic and into the Iran-Iraq war, shows her being sent abroad during the war and largely growing up in Vienna and then returns her to Iran where Marjane must decide if she can live in a homeland that has become so alien to her.The best way to describe this film is to say that it isn't bad, but there just isn't much too it. The first half of the movie gets to be quite tedious because it's mostly Marjane listening to adults talking about how ""this"" happened in Iran, and then ""that"" happened in Iran, and then ""this other thing"" happened in Iran. If you're looking for a very, very remedial lesson on Iranian history of the late 1970s and early 1980s, you'll find it here. However, it's not that educational and it's not at all entertaining.Persepolis picks up quite a bit in the second half, though, as it focuses on Marjane's experiences as a young woman in Vienna. The story becomes much sharper and more engaging, particularly a pathetically hilarious effort by Marjane to misremember a boyfriend who cheated on her. The film holds on to that energy and edge as Marjane returns to Iran and tries to fit into a bifurcated society, where young Iranians party with booze and American rock music by night and fear government harassment for the slightest violation of Islamic morality by day.The characters in Persepolis are almost all rather two-dimensional, even for a cartoon. The only one who really stands out is Marjane's sharp-tongued, strong-willed grandmother, yet it never really does anything to explore how this remarkable woman sustained herself in a society that, from her perspective, had gone insane.The animation here is very flat and uncomfortably straddles the line between cartoonish and realistic. This style may have been very effective for the static images of the original graphic novel but when you add movement to them, they become too cartoonish to be realistic yet too plain and ordinary to lift the story out of the mundane. This film is also mostly in black-and-white and while live action in black-and white can be extremely powerful visually, black-and-white animation doesn't hold a candle to color.Persepolis was a minor sensation as a graphic novel. It never got beyond the art house crowd as a movie. I would guess that's because, as a film, it's like a short story about a very interesting subject by a very average writer. Persepolis might inspire you to seek out more knowledge about the Iran of the last 30 years. As a work of art or entertainment, however, it is unexceptional."
84,Persepolis,6,2 October 2008,Style Without Substance.,"Well, here it is: as a cartoonist myself, I was interested chiefly because of style, and Persepolis has tons of style. Unfortunately, it does not have tons of content. In preparation for the film, which shot in and out of theaters too fast for me to catch it, I read the 2-volume graphic novel on which the film is based. What basically happened was, all the great, enthralling, life-altering stuff that happens in volume one fails to make the character grow at all in volume two, when she's ""coming of age"" (I really hate that phrase). She lives through war and poverty and revolutions gone wrong, and all she learns how to do is date silly men, act inconsistently toward friends, and throw secret parties to thwart the Iranian government. So it's sort of a let-down. Mind you, the film and the book are subtly different, but the book is the better, more complete story, so I refer to it primarily, to give the best face to the story as a whole. The film, however, ends with a bizarre choice of reference to an earlier conversation which has no business being the last lines of the film, and seems to have been tacked on just to place a chord at the end of a song with no ending. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the film seems to quit on itself. The author quits on God, country, and nearly everyone else during her life, so I guess quitting is the theme."
85,Persepolis,8,23 January 2008,Striking animation brought down by the story,"Though the external events that the story is set during are pretty fascinating and handled well, I was never really invested or even interested in Marji's story. I found her to be a rather unlikeable protagonist, and thus I was either annoyed or bored by most of her coming-of-age development. Aside from this, though, the film is astonishing. There are really no words for how unbelievably expressive and vivid the animation is, and the wonderfully composed images are a testament to this. With a stronger story, this could have been something really special, but I'll settle for something refreshingly different in a genre that's in pretty poor shape these days."
86,Persepolis,10,16 August 2008,powerful and painful,"as a young Turkish woman, Persepolis hurts me a lot.. a perfect movie but a painful experience for us. i can see the Islamic revolution step by step which might occur in turkey soon. (hope won't but..)domination of new system, cruelty and blood... a war and a revolution... massacre of communists and antagonists. women who forced to believe that hiding behind the veil is freedom. the secret parties, punk cassettes at black market as resistance.. the fall of great Persian culture...i admire Marjane's intelligence, talent and courage. i love you sister!congrats..."
87,Persepolis,8,25 April 2008,Brilliant animated feature - yet a tad elitist in its view of Iran,"This autobiographical animated feature dealing with the coming of age of a young girl in Iran during the revolutionary period is witty and engaging all way through, as well as technically brilliant, yet its narrow middle class view makes you wince from time to time. Co director Marjanne Satrapi, born in 1969 into a progressive middle class Iranian family, tells how as a young girl she witnessed the fall of the shah, the coming of the Islamic regime, the brutal Iran-Iraq war, how she was sent during the mid 1980s to Austria by her family, where she saw first hand some of the nihilistic life style of European youth, how there she fell into drugs and almost die after a doomed love affair, how she returned to Iran in the early 90s, enrolling in the university and getting into an ill fated marriage before going to exile to France. Made in engaging black and white, 2D animation, and full of faux naif touches, the problem with this movie is Satrapi's inability to see what happened in Iran outside the narrow view of Iran's westernized middle class. In fact, the working class of Iran is virtually absent from the movie. And her personal complaints (about how her right to consume trash culture from the west was infringed) seems petty and trivial (to her credit, she does realize this from time to time, as when she meets an old childhood friend, a crippled veteran from the war). The film ugliest bit is when the girl's mother complains that the new administrator in a hospital in newly revolutionary Iran used to be a window washer."
88,Persepolis,10,24 April 2008,"""Great"" picture, yet revealing a horribly accurate ""Truth""...","Well, i'm intending to write a piece which deserves the labeling ""in a nutshell"": Despite the nearly-impossible-to-deny Sharply strong points, say the amazing and exciting story-telling, marvelous (and even considerable as a revolutionary ) animation, and admirable sarcastic yet hurting humor, and literally many more, there's a ""Climax"" laying there: As a 20 years old still-living-in-there Iranian, i must admit more-than-98-percent accuracy of this narration...Yes, scenes you are watching while feeling secured ,and probably wondering if all the events described can be really true, are parts of my every-day seen...there's nothing exaggerated in there to your surprise, and to my sorrow, there are a lot of delicate (and again hurting) points that i believe is beyond the understanding (meaning being able to make them out ) of people who have not Felt and Lived the bitterly horrible of this atmosphere...This is a perfect and Highly must-see movie, that not only gives you the pleasure of watching a really Real art, but also makes you aware of ""what Really is going on..."", which left me with this seemingly unanswerable question that: should i really be happy about release of this movie or not..."
89,Persepolis,8,1 April 2008,bad fate for millions of Iranian women after revolution,"As a girl born in Iran and experience similar things I should admit that the movie was so real to me! I think hundred of thousands of Iranian women have experienced the same things as it has represented in the movie, many escaped from the country , many are trying to that and the rest try to stand the situation, as it is a only possible option. The country was ruined after revolution and it getting worse day by day. We feel a sense of diaspora even within the country. In persepolis you can properly how the whole situation changed after the revolution the whole society changed, it wasn't our generation fault to conduct the revolution but now we are suffering from a big mistake, the democracy had been always absent in the history of Iran.The movie was represented very precise and important points. I liked it."
90,Persepolis,10,28 February 2008,A Terrific French Art House Movie,"Persepolis (2007): Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve, Danielle Darrieux, Simon Abrikan, Gabrielle Lopes, Francois Jerosme, ARie Elmahleh, Jean-Francois Gallote, Stephane Foenkinos, Tilly Mandelbrot...Director Vincent Paronnaud, Marjane Satrapi, Screenplay Vincent Paronnaud, Marjane Satrapi.Based on Marjane Satrapi's novel and Graphic Novel Comic Book of her own memoirs, this is its French animated film version. Marjane Satrapi grew up in Europe and lives in Paris, after having seen the atrocities of Saddam Hussein's version of Islam taking over her native country of Iran. Directed by Vincent Paronnaud, the film stars Chiara Mastroiani and French film star Catherine Deneuve. The look of the film follows the comic book closely and is a dark, brooding very introspective piece. This was one of the few films that gained international attention at the Oscars but it's a very fresh, unique and modern film dealing with the subject of Islam. As France today currently holds a huge Muslim population, this film is targeting an audience who would relate with Marjane and her world. She is a child born in a revolution period, and who would later become Westernized in Vienna, Austria and later Paris, never quite fitting in with the repressive world of Saddam's regime. This is a deeply moving tale, often funny and poignant, an autobiography and a literary sort of animated film.The story: Marjane is a little girl in the late 1970's living with her mother, father and grandmother when an English-influenced Sha still ruled the country. His rule came to an end when Saddam's forces took over. Times became too dangerous for the lively and often rebellious Marjane (she likes to listen to ""Western"" American rock music like Iron Maiden, ABBA, and Punk Rock, Michael Jackson, etc) so her parents send her to a Catholic school in Vienna, Austria during the 80's. She is too much trouble for the nuns so she moves out on her own, paying rent and sharing a house with a judgemental older woman. In Vienna, she befriends anarchistic youth and rock-lovers, loses her virginity to a young man who decides to be homosexual afterward and falls in love with a young novelist who betrays her. She becomes depressed and disoriented, homeless and destitute. She returns to her native Iran only to find that it has changed a lot since she left. Although schools for girls are permitted, they are always wearing veils and have to show too much submission to males. The military is always around and Hussein's dictatorship is too much for her. She marries, divorces and remains too unhappy in Tehran. She leaves for Paris.This is an exquisite, captivating, dark, humorous and yet powerful film despite the misleading cutesy animation. This is a film with a PG-13 rating for some mild violence (this is a film about a war-torn country and a dictatorship after all) and because of the adult language. But it can indeed be enjoyed by students of modern history and by French film fanatics. It has won some film awards and has become a favorite of art house film lovers. Catherine Deneuve as Grandmother is possibly her greatest role in recent years. Deneuve is a veteran of French films and one of the most beloved and famous actresses of French cinema. Her contributions to films of every genre and kind show her versatility and appreciation of modern culture. With wonderful original music, great animation and acting (they truly act with their voices) This is ultimately Miss Satrapi's work and she is a brilliant woman with a story that must be told."
91,Persepolis,7,4 February 2008,Treats for the mind and eyes/A personal tale amidst history,"The first thing I noticed about this film was the gorgeous black and white artwork. This is a rather unique film in that it's a mature animated film in French that's playing in theaters in America and actually making a little coin. Being a mature animation or French typically dooms a film in the US, but even with both, it seems to have some kind of box office life.Persepolis is essentially a graphic autobiography, adapted to animation, about the life of the writer-director, Marjane Satrapi. As an autobiography, it's a rather free floating affair, simply just following Marji from her youth to her present without encapsulating it in any major story. Rather, the whole affair is episodic and a little rhythmic, which makes it quite mesmerizing, but at the same time, that the overall film lacks any noticeable structure outside of a chronological drive, interrupted by moments of present-day recollection, takes quite a bit of the power of the story out of its wings. Stronger story-framing would have helped immensely.On the other hand, the art is absolutely gorgeous throughout the entire affair. While primarily being stark high contrast animation, sometimes the background details are beautifully textured and the film uses restraint in animated fancy, but still manages to put in a lot of style that makes the aesthetic of the film entirely memorable. Music and voice acting are also good.Despite my minor quibbles with the film, Persepolis remains important because of the (his)story that it tells. It stays important because it keeps alive in memory the troubled past of Iran as well as a personal story of the failures of escape. I don't know if Marji learns anything in the end, but we do. As such, this is an eye-dazzling story of one Iranian ex-patriot that is at times moving, fantastic and a little meandering. Good. 7/10."
92,Persepolis,8,21 December 2017,Persepolis,"A style so simplistic, yet all characters are able to be identified. Carrying a story with twists and turns, as any life does, this story makes me feel like I could be her, but I also wish to meet her. Liked it."
93,Persepolis,8,18 December 2017,Amazing Movie,"Personally, I enjoyed this movie and would give it an eight based on a ten scale. I enjoyed this movie due to the fact that it shows injustices that quite often are overlooked, such as in Iran. The movie starts with Marjane trying to board a plane to Iran, but is unable to. She sits down and smokes a cigarette and thinks back to her childhood at the age of nine, and then it progresses almost to the present day. This movie speaks of the horrid laws put into place because of the Irani government when regimes changed. I personally would recommend this movie to a friend, as it opens your eyes to what life was, and has progressed to in Iran. Which, for me, is halfway around the world, and nowhere similar to the United States."
94,Persepolis,,9 June 2017,Growing Pains,"Growing up amid wars and repression in 1970s and 1980s Iran proves challenging for a free-spirited girl in this animated drama based on the real life experiences of co-director Marjane Satrapi. Mostly filmed in stark black and white with accentuated shadows and elongated, eerie silhouettes, 'Persepolis' is not your average animated film in the best possible way. Aside from looking great, the animation process allows the filmmakers to do more than what live action can do, providing especially wide eyes for Marjane as a child, incorporating fantasy sequences (imagining herself hung up by her ears), including dream sequences and dreamy bits like Marjane literally hopping from building to building to depict all the places that she moved to at one point in her life. There is also a nifty scene set to 'Eye of the Tiger'. Marjane's experiences as a child are, however, far more interesting than her bouncing between unhappy relationships as an adult, with this being one of those movies in which the second half is less magical than the first half. In a way this is appropriate for a film about a girl waking up to the harsh realities of her patriarchal society, but it is the scenes of young Marjane pretending to be Bruce Lee and believing everything is possible as a child, as opposed to the scenes of her arguing for equal rights at university, that linger in the mind long afterwards."
95,Persepolis,8,12 December 2016,A Stalinist Review,"The following story is my imagined encounter I had a dream that would be feasible for a Stalinist version of Persepolis, since the only people who would be biking, skating, or inline skate street sport partakers in California would be a young person who is probably educated with a Common Core that is close to French abstract studies. It is highly possible as a eclipsed review since the only person that would be forgiven passively for their imagining that Persepolis or the war in Tehran, Iran in the years depicted in the war movie would have top be someone who feels their life is in a war to stay in a dreamily state they perceive as real, so in that state, they could even imagine that the war was made up and that they are a person who was drafted into some sort of war just in order to realize they were the female narrator in the story who merely yearned to receive their university education: I was in a pit bull-riven area of San Leandro, CA and I got so afraid I would be mulled by one but it turns out that there was one fence that looked closed but it was open and two large borzoi dogs who look very smart, private and caring after each other, and were deep black/brown redhead dog couple they used their nose to pry the open fence a bit more open but then the one closest to the outside of the fence used it's nose to hold the fence a hinge close except for a ruler length and it didn't attack me, or the couple borzoi did not because they saw I was a woman who was skateboarding and who had stopped and I didn't go forward so I am holding at my mercy a few skateboarders and inline skaters in my neighborhood since I won't go back to where the dogs are and on top of that, they may just be stupid youth who will be mauled by the dog(s) in that area instead, and so because the universe knows that, the spirits in them that are good and want to be a body that will survive because they know they will be at a higher chance of getting killed by their body master's depression after they get pulled apart by the dogs for not being me... so I'm trying to see if I can suck the spirits out of them have a better body or master or whatever u call it.Sun 8:31pm I lied I made that up because I had a nightmare that Tehran of Persepolis in the Iranian war was a made up event called Stalinism since it could be that a person could have just made up Tehran of that year that they as a man got drafted and the main character in Persepolis got to study in France! Since it would make since that if a person who is in a neighborhood with dogs, at the beginning of Persepolis they release dogs to run after the dude and so he gets attacked but in my lie I just told you I am a ghost that always haunts and taunts the person who is imagining a made up Tehran of Iran in the war years, since only a person who is unconscious is not guilty of thinking that their reality is made up to any extent or brink that would somehow manufacture to their brain that they are still in the real world and their fantasy a real reality they live in real life and the person who saw the two borzoi and was spared, well they keep taunting this poor person hooked up to a ventilator since, if it was just one memory of their being mauled apart by pit bulls then, technically that vision of the smart borzoi would be their saving grace in an alternate universe where they were not mauled and left in a coma for the rest of their life."
96,Persepolis,8,17 September 2015,Iran 101,"Poignant coming-of-age story of a precocious and outspoken young Iranian girl that begins during the Islamic Revolution.The graphic novel ""Persepolis"" was very widely read. In fact, a number of college courses required it. It is an excellent look at the difference between what people think of Iran and what being from Iran actually means for those who lived through the last generation.The film adds so much more with the music, the inflection, and just really getting a human quality that cannot be expressed fully on paper. The animation stays true to the original art, really bringing out its strengths. It made me wan to read the book again and learn more about the author's royal lineage!"
97,Persepolis,9,19 June 2015,A New Kind of Animation.,"Persepolis (2007): Dir: Marjane Satrapi / Voices: Chiara Mastroianni, Catherine Deneuve, Simon Abkarian, Danielle Darrieux, Francois Jerosme: Unique animated film that isn't for families but for those scholars of animation, they will definitely find much to appreciate with its different approach to the genre. It deals with serious issues regarding persecution and family as well as the harsh condition for which these people endured. It chronicles the life of a young Muslim girl whose wild imagination often verges trouble. She lives through the Iran / Iraq war but is spirited away at the urge of her family where she grows weary of a school in Vienna. Director Marjane Satrapi delivers an original animated style that is backed with themes of economic distress. Characters and the world they inhabit are mostly black and white, which endorses the particular style and mood of the film. The voice talents include Chiara Mastroianni who lights up the lead and her open imagination during the war and destruction of society. Catherine Deneuve, and Simon Abkarian voice her parents while Danielle Darrieux voices her grandmother. Francois Jerosme voices an uncle. One thing that becomes clear is that a good imagination comes in handy during times of extreme duress, and this film demonstrate that quality effectively. The film voices its message through its unique animated style. Score: 9 / 10"
98,Persepolis,10,8 May 2015,I have no words,"This movie is about a true story of the life of a woman who is a result of the Iranian revolution, it leaves you in an indescribable emotional state as it shows you the truth through the eyes of a real person who experienced what can only be described as oppression. Perspolis has created a new form of animation, which attracts the audience to its engaging visual and aural aspects. This film is full of depth as it truly shows the triumph of the human spirit where a woman whiteness's the country she once called home turn against her. There are many out there like Marjane who have gone through the suffering she has, this movie is not just any movie, its a political statement, its a fierce journey, it manages to show us what makes us human through the magic of cinema.This movie is a gem, in a theatrical world currently filled with action and comedy, sometimes we need to look at the truth behind the actions of a country and how they affect incredible individuals."
99,Persepolis,9,27 March 2015,Exceptional adaption of the wonderful graphic novel,"Persepolis is a film adapted from the autobiography compiled by Marjane Satrapi. It depicts her life as a child growing up around the time of the Iranian revolution in '79, her life as an adolescent in Europe, and her return to Iran and young adult life. The animation is two dimensional and in black and white, which I like as it evokes the same feelings as the novel. It is simple but still quite appealing and well put together. The progression flows very well, if a bit brief at times. The film works both as a coming of age story and political film, with these elements intertwining. Satrapi did a wonderful job at telling her story, it is fascinating throughout and structured perfectly. Anyone can identify with her in some way, even if one hasn't experienced such oppression from a government, certainly they felt as she did at one time. The only thing that refrains me from giving Persepolis a higher rating then an 8 is that the film is honestly too short at 90 minutes. The graphic novel had some great situations/subplots that I think the film could have drawn more attention to. I think if it was around maybe 30 or 40 minutes longer it would have been perfect."
100,Persepolis,10,1 March 2015,Remembrance of things past,"While animation is an art form primarily associated with children's entertainment, there are more than a few animated films which deal with more mature themes and are geared towards an older audience. PERSEPOLIS is one such film. Co-directed by Marjane Satrapi, who based this on her experiences as a young girl growing up in Iran, it tells a story about the struggle to find one's identity in a rapidly changing world. In Marjane's case, her formative years took place amid the chaotic years of the Islamic Revolution when the US-backed Shah was overthrown by populist revolt and an Islamic Republic established in its place. Even though communist revolutionaries, such as her uncle, were imprisoned under the Shah's rules, the Islamic Republic that replaced it was in some ways even more repressive. As a way of escaping this, Marjane is sent off to a French school in Vienna but she eventually comes back to her family after bad experiences leave her alone and almost destitute. Yet, the Iran she returns to is even more different than the one she grew up in and left before. Ultimately, this is a simultaneously complex and simple look at Iranian life through the eyes of a young woman. It's complex in the sense that Marjane has conflicted feelings about the country of her ancestors, yet simple because it is presented through the eyes of someone who has yet to find themselves. This film is based on a graphic novel, and the mostly black-and-white animation style reproduces this look faithfully while also adding a sense of childlike wonder. It was a simple, yet beautiful, way to tell an important story. I hesitate to say that Marjane's story is representative of all Iranians' experience, yet it is valuable precisely because it is a personal experience. The story of her life growing up is tragic and hopeful, sad and yet still not without humor. This roller-coaster of emotions and unique look at an oft misunderstood culture are the film's strongest selling points, aside from the top-notch animation and score. For viewers looking to expand their horizons a bit, PERSEPOLIS has everything you could possibly want from a great film: action, romance, tragedy, humor, etc. It has it all, and most importantly it provides unique cultural insight. Highly recommended."
101,Persepolis,,4 May 2014,Pretty excellent,"Well, it took me long enough to finally get around to watching this. Ever since its release, it's been one of those films I said I'd watch one day. I don't exactly know why I took this long, but it surpassed my expectations. It's completely engrossing, the animation really does wonders for this coming-of-age story, sort of hard to see it being done any other way. The editing work here is pretty amazing, always finding a fresh and seamless approach to balancing its many different cuts in time. I'm not necessarily sure that I think it's better than Ratatouille, another truly amazing animated film, but it definitely deserved a Screenplay nomination at the least."
102,Persepolis,9,26 March 2014,Speaks the truth in such bold volume,"Persepolis is a wonderful tale about a young girl's journey from childhood spent in war-torn Iran to adulthood. The main character is strong, one that the audience can sympathise with, and fairly intelligent. The history of the Iran-Iraq war is told with such sincerity and emotion. It's explained with lyrical and poetic clarity in a way that the audience can emotionally connect to and understand. The narrations by Marjane, her father, and several other people in the life of Marjane do not sound like boring history lectures, but insightful and captivating accounts of destruction, hatred, terror, injustice, and the likes. The film touches on many controversial issues such as women's rights in traditional Islamic countries, war, torture, and corruption. It is very well adapted, entertaining, and incredibly refreshing. I particularly appreciated the colour switching, which many have called pretentious. However, I think it suits the film very well and serves a wonderfully artistic purpose.Persepolis is a great film for women, a great film for men, for those who have suffered, for those who want to understand suffering, for those who appreciate good animated films, for those who like politically charged dramas with a heart and a mind, and for anyone who can appreciate a great film as rare as this one."
103,Persepolis,7,8 March 2014,Animation works great for childhood,"Marjane Statrapi struggles with her identity as she recalls her childhood in revolutionary Iran. Starting from 1978 in Tehran, her family is middle class. Even though they live a comfortable modern life, they also suffer under the dictatorial rule of the Shah. Her family rejoice at his overthrow at first. However, Islamic fundamentalists turn the new regime into a repressive tyranny. After suffering years of war and deprivation, her parents sent her away to study in Vienna. Life abroad isn't easy either, and she had difficulties fitting in. When she returns to Iran, she is completely lost. Just as things improve personally and the war ends, the repression gets worst.It's an animated movie based on Marjane Statrapi's personal comic novel. The use of simple animation brings her childhood observations to life. However it doesn't do the same thing when she's more grown up. The second half of the movie isn't quite as fascinating. The animation style doesn't do her adult years with enough justice. Complex ideas and emotions seem to be simplified by the block style drawings."
104,Persepolis,8,27 August 2013,a wonderful film,"Without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time. The first time I ran into Persepolis I had absolutely no idea what the film was or what it might be about, just sat down in a small town foreign film festival and started watching, and i was not disappointed to spend my time learning the story of Marjan. The film is remarkably entertaining and incredibly easy to relate to despite the difference of decades and thousands of miles dividing my childhood from Marjan's. Persepolis is basically a story of a child's journey to adulthood set against the backdrop of civil unrest in Iran and learning to find one's self in the midst of social change.From losing a loved one, finding, losing, and finding faith again, and ultimately learning who you are versus what everyone sees,there are many more lessons to be learned from Persepolis than just surviving war and oppression. Having read the comics after watching the film I can say that after re watching the film It does stay true to the comic books, which as an avid comic book fan is something incredibly important to me. Persepolis is a definite must see for anyone coming out of adolescence or anyone wanting to reflect on their childhood or see it from a different point of view."
105,Persepolis,9,28 February 2013,To be or not to be from Iran,"If you want to see light at the horizon of the adult cartoon world, Iranian born Marjane Satrapi's animated autobiographical feature ""Persepolis"" should be one of your first stops. The daughter of a wealthy progressive family in Tehran, expatriate Satrapi recounts her coming-of-age tale, beginning with her childhood days growing up under the western orientated Shah, then witnessing revolution, the subsequent repression of the totalitarian regime, war, followed by her on-and-off escape from her homeland. Satrapi doesn't tell you what to think of her story, she just relays her confusing impressions as a young girl and the outlook on life that goes with it, all brought to the screen via the perfect medium for such a purpose: animation. The fascinating, primarily monochrome look adds realism and weight to the portrayed subject matter, counterbalanced with a lot of charm and humor working splendidly against the dire circumstances that abound. The animation approach also helps to maintain a strong bond with the protagonist through all the stages of the young developing life, formed partly by experiences caused by political turmoil, partly by disorientation as a human being - and due to the intense personal take on the events it stays believable, especially as Satrapi mainly shows aspects in her life to which Westerners can relate. ""Persepolis"" oscillates between a young kid's floating on clouds in admiration for idols like Bruce Lee and Michael Jackson, the harsh socio-political reality on the ground and the consequential estrangement from life, the universe and everything. And still, remarkably, this girl made her way.Satrapi would follow up her adventure into the movie world with ""Chicken with Plums"", this time using real actors and focusing on a side of Satrapi that ""Persepolis"" neglected: the artist. While that story stands on its own, the disenchantment of the protagonist nevertheless connects thematically strongly with ""Persepolis"". To those interested this very quirky romantic picture is warmly recommended as well. It looks stupendously French, but is all about that beautiful girl of back then, the one who bears the name Irâne."
106,Persepolis,,1 January 2013,A Flawless Triumph,"Should have been nominated as best picture of 2007. Persepolis is the autobiography of Marjane Satrapi's life as an Iranian girl during the height of the Islamic Revolution. With a great premise, a great setting, great actors and an amazing amount of intelligent idealism, Persepolis must've swept the Oscars.The movie had hearty and relatable characters, characters that are very hard to find in the movies of today. And the dialog between the characters was as if they hired their writers from the New You've got very intelligent and clever dialog, most quotes might last with you forever. The movie's script and plot was completely flawless.A message for the parents, it may look like a ""cute"" cartoon, but keep your kid away from this one until they are at least 14. Unless you want to be answering their questions halfway through the movie. That doesn't make it a bad movie. 10 out of 10"
107,Persepolis,8,26 December 2012,"If there's a category called Biography-Animation, this has to be the best among the whole lot.","The movie is a divergent from the usual Animated films that create countries, creatures and characters that are otherwise not existent. A major part of the movie-the narrator's past- is shown in black and white, while the present world of the author is colorful and I loved the way the movie transits from a colorful Paris airport to the early years of the narrator.The movie is about a girl who grows up in a revolutionary Iran and refuses to comply with the existent rules and the ever-changing rules that are brought about by every new regime. Marjane is a curious, cute little girl who hails from a family of revolutionists, and belonged to the majority of the population that wished to see the fall of the Westernized empire of the Shah. Marjane idolizes her uncle Anouch, who was an ardent communist and loved her as much as he'd have loved his own daughter. She grows up to be a music lover, a fan of Iron Maiden, Michael Jackson, when anything and everything Western was considered a sacrilege. She leaves the country for education and when she returns, everything changes around. She quits complaining about the system and picks a laugh or two with her each daringly funny attempt to avoid the bearded, gun-wielding soldiers.The movie wonderfully portrays the plight of Iranian women, how they had to battle a system they couldn't comply with, yet exercise their liberty at will.It's a brilliant and an unprecedented artistic attempt to bring the horrors of war in animated form. I wish the movie was nominated in the Best Foreign Language Film category too, an award that it deserves."
108,Persepolis,9,23 November 2012,Under-rated,"This is a terrific animation of a person who lived through a very constrained way of life. The black and white presentation presents a detailed and realistic myriad of life issues , but somehow manages to convey these complications in an easy-to-understand and thought-provoking concept which all of us can relate to and ponder. This is impressive as many films failed to achieve a good balance between too little and too much content.Sadly, this film is underrated by many awards, even though it is that good and should have deserve more recognition. Perhaps it could have won some award if it were to be released in a different year"
109,Persepolis,9,4 June 2012,Persepolis Review,"The storyline of this plot is basically seeing the development of Iran before and after the Revolution through the eyes of a fifteen-year-old girl named Marji. Through the events that Marji experiences, she is wrenched from her childhood, exposed to the reality of the world: violence, sex, and authority. Marji's society is run by the Sharia Law of Islam. Throughout the Revolution, she struggles to find her identity, conforming with and rebelling against the Sharia Law at times, as well as leaving and returning to Iran after a lot of soul searching.The story accurately portrays the theme of Islam values. Religion is the reason for Persepolis. It demonstrates how religions restricts the people in Iran under the Sharia Law. Woman are forced to wear veils to avoid men from lusting and to avoid other women or people to be envious of their outlooks; which are against the teachings of the Qu'ran. Alcohol and smoking are forbidden, which also restricts the social lives of people. Obscene music and images are forbidden, such as the rock and roll music that Marji was listening to. It is also clear that people in the Iranian society have to be more careful about how they interact with each other, especially when the Guardians or police are nearby. All in all, religion is like a leash that tells you what to do and what not to do, whether you like it or not. Persepolis has not exemplified the life of an Iranian citizen under the Sharia Law, but it has also portrayed the impact of religion on society."
110,Persepolis,7,27 May 2012,Historically a very important film,"Historically a very important film. There are films on World wars and there are those on American Vietnam war. Basically, there are films in wars involving America but how life's are effected in Iran due to their wars is seldom seen. Yet, this movie is not all about war and nowhere is war actually shown. It's more as to how a child's life is affected by a war that she is not even part of.Lots of changes have happened in Middle Asia and Gulf countries in the last half of century that is post 1950's where regimes in countries were overthrown and democracy was embraced. Latest to add is Egypt and before were several countries and Iran is was made republic in 1979. The story is of Marjane Satrapi and is directed by herself and is based on her autobiographical graphic novel. It brings out many facets of war actually and the tyranny of leadership and how it affects poor Innocent people. If anything I loved then it was animation, 2D animation and the simplicity that lay in telling a story effectively. Kudos to Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud for showing us a movie that showcases us characters that are universal in nature and the way they react yet are attached to their nativities and inherited biases and inherent inhibitions. Marjane is a girl worth wooing for, who is spirited yet flawed who is fragile and easily broken, yet upright and progressive in outlook.This movie touched me and the narration was compelling. I will go with 3/5 a good one for sure and please have time for some history to be known that might not be relevant to anyone outside Iran, yet the theme of ""freedom seeking"" is universal."
111,Persepolis,,17 March 2012,more than an Iranian tale,"Iran story. Iranian lives. a girl. a revolution. and broken pieces of expectation. a black-white movie about a white-black tale. cold, cruel, realistic, impressive. map of sense search. reflection of each temptation to be more than a shadow. testimony, fresco, travel in the deep form of reality. short images, a lot of suggestions. a circle. gray, strange, cynical. innocence and its blood. crumbs of time and value of family. refuges and illusions. sure, an autobiography. at first sigh. in fact, more that. a construction who grows-up in every experience of public. a mixture of drawing, voice, music and memories. a ladder to last shelf. a tale. about small things. out of any definition."
112,Persepolis,7,21 February 2012,"I almost walked out, but I ended up liking it","I grew up in the 70s and 80s, and while I didn't live in Iran at the time, I was well aware of the strife, oppression and prejudice toward the Iranian people. That said, I still don't like propaganda being poured down my throat, even when I agree with it. And that's how the first half of this film comes across: propaganda.BUT WAIT...!If you feel like walking out, sit with it and see what happens in the 2nd half. The first half is deliberately oversimplified and cartoonish because it's showing the perspective of a young girl with limited information. As the story progresses and she grows up, the story begins to take on new dimensions and complexities that make it worthwhile.By the time it ended, I still considered it a rather one-sided view, i.e. it makes sweeping generalizations about countries, cultures, governments and men with beards (haha, notice how all the bearded men are evil), but after all it *is* a cartoon, and cartoons are designed to be cartoonish. Wow, now there's a brilliant revelation.If you're somewhat skeptical about political beliefs, this may be difficult for you to swallow because it comes at you pretty hard and uncompromising. I personally prefer films that allow you to form your own conclusions, or better yet, films that show opposing, unpopular viewpoints like something Clint Eastwood might do (Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, the Unforgiven, etc). In ""Persepolis"" it's pretty straightforward: the Shah is bad, governments torture innocent people, western nations do nothing, soldiers die for nothing, women are treated like dirt, and of course bearded men are evil. But if you watch this film for its human lesson about a young girl growing up in the shadow of oppression, not for its political lesson we all know (or should know) by now, it has some really interesting themes. It left me feeling satisfied.For films that do focus on compelling political/wartime messages that you may not have considered, I'd look in the direction of ""Tiger and the Snow"" (2005) a comedy/romance set during the war in Iraq, ""No Man's Land"" (2001) a fabulous fable about Bosnia/Herzegovinia, ""None But the Brave"" (1965) about the WWII Pacific Theatre, ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence"" (1983) also set in WWII, and the fabulous fantasy/comedy/war drama ""Welcome to Dongmakgol"" (2005) about a crazy little town stuck in the middle of the Korean War."
113,Persepolis,9,30 January 2012,An individual flight through a historic era,"First: Excuse my English - its not that good, as I'm German.As I've heard of this move Persepolis I was told that its about the Iran-Revolution 'bout the 70s. But its much more than just an historic exclude to an mind changing time - its the personal breakthrough towards the individual freedom and religious independence. Freedom in the cost of losing the ones you love; so the movie is telling you the ying and yang of life - as you see the positive sides of live and decisions, there's always the yang that follows with tragedious side effects; Love and Freedom in Contrast - a lifetime decision.But why not all 10 points? Well, actually its my subjective dislike to this kind of comic-look-like - there are different comic-movies with political background id prefer (just in the case of looking and the kind the whole movie is drawn) such as ""waltz with bashir"".Never the less an all in all great movie that teaches you to love and defend your achieved freedoms. 9/10"
114,Persepolis,8,5 October 2010,Princess of Persia,"Okay, I agree: this animated comic-strip may not be as piercingly controversial or probing as the subject matter demands, but if you see it as an honest coming-of-age tale under especially difficult political and cultural circumstances, you're in for a real treat.At first sight the clean-cut animation style may appear to be too inexpressive, but in fact there's an abstract depth to it. The witty episodic screenplay is chock-full of darkly humorous and poignantly personal moments. The voice cast is excellent.Some characters are drawn in too broad a stroke, but the personal touch is never less than engaging.8 out of 10 Viennese experiences"
115,Persepolis,9,26 August 2010,Excellent bio rendered in a graphic way,"Saw this in French on a repertoire channel. Since Quebec has already showed this in their big screen with rave reviews and always curious to see a tell tale of what happened in Iran and the setbacks that occurred, decided to have a look.I was very pleased to see through the eyes of a young girl, turned later a woman, the quest of keeping freedom of speech and living in an oppressive turned regime, from a corrupt empire to an Islamic republic, with careful watch on the way of living. Iran was torn by war, but the freedom ideals of this young woman were put in question mostly throughout this story.Fun to see this in black and white motion. Interesting that Ms.Satrapi decided to put this autobiography in animation, it gives another perspective.Even if you're not an animation buff, this movie is to see for any believer in freedom in an oppressive regime..."
116,Persepolis,10,24 August 2010,Great story with striking animation,"What I really like about this movie is the honesty of the story. The main character in a lot of auto-biographical stories is made out to be without flaws or only have very minor ones, and in this story you can see the main character in ways she shouldn't receive sympathy and is down right selfish at times. It is a movie that can make me laugh and cry every time, not in spite of this, but because of this real nature of the story, it is one girl's story though her eyes.Don't watch the movie if you are looking for an impartial view of the events in the movie, it is telling the story through the eyes of one girl/woman and the way that she viewed the events. She isn't the typical Iranian, she came from an upper middle class family so she has far more opportunities than most so when she was causing political problems, her family can afford to ship off to Europe. I don't think this makes the movie poorer because it is her story, not the story of Iran, if you watch the movie with this in mind, you will probably enjoy it."
117,Persepolis,9,31 January 2010,Film so pure and innocent,"I had heard some good reviews about the film long before I watched it last night, but what made me view this film was the fact that most of the story was represented in black and white. Black & White signifies purity, simplicity and creates equality in all.The film focuses on the innocence of little Iranian girl who has normal dreams and hopes in life. Presepolis intelligently conveys the message of simple and regular Iranians who just want to live a normal life, and how politics and war can be damaging to thousands of innocent people.My suggestion is view this film with positive and happy thoughts about the Middle Eastern people who only want ""love"".Enjoy!Neeil Bhatia bhatian@yahoo.com"
118,Persepolis,9,17 July 2009,Commendable !,"I don't know what Persepolis means, but its just a great movie. Showing the Iranian war scene through a 9 year old, the movie is a breathtaking account of the changes in customs a country goes through in war. Very contemporary (With some similar style of Southpark series), the movie aims at associating everyone for the particular question- do you have a choice? The direction and screenplay is brilliant, for a comic. The benefit of using just 2 colors in the movie is imminent. Just by showing shades of whites, the plot undergoes through the lighter moments of life and then follows the blacks with difficult phases of life. Its something which everyone has experienced in life, the unending struggle against life, the ups and downs of the tide which one rides on. The message is evident, Be yourself! The movie aims to be emphasize the importance of being yourself and not yielding away in pressure. The protagonist, a forceful girl with no fear in heart against the world shows the Iranian society from her eyes. The modernist thinking clashes with the conservative 'religious' clergy, police and many more, only to realize that their motives are not exactly religious, but selfishly modern too.Am impressed with the whole idea, the execution and the editing of the story. bravo! PS: English subtitles are the only way to watch it. Someone should dub in English and release in the western society."
119,Persepolis,10,7 July 2009,This movie is a must for every young and old person.,"This movie is a must for every young and old person living in freedom to remember freedom as a high commodity. Even for people living in countries with dictators give them hope by these strong pictures (e.g.happiness exists in every dark and minds cannot be imprisoned).This film was made with great love for details such as face movements, dreaming moments and the feeling of being in love. I like this film very much because it shows the power and energy of a child in general (e.g. scene where Persepolis shouts against the fall of the Shah/king and needs to go to bed and then lowering her voice continuing ""fall of the Shah"") and the power of words (e.g. at the university as an art student and at the every day life such as in the bar Persepolis says what she thinks).I would like to thank you, Ms. Satrapi and your team, for this great film because it expresses a lot of feelings. It reminds me also of painter Marc Chagall when it comes to the dream scenes.I hope that people living not as free as they wanted to can watch this really poetic and sweet pictures besides dramatic and sad contents (e.g. tanks arrive at the city or a young person was shot)."
120,Persepolis,,29 June 2009,One of the better adaptations,"Iran is probably one of the most interesting and accessible countries in the middle east with rich culture, an interesting historical background and a young generation questioning and rebelling age old adage and the place of religion in the society. It also is the most westernized region in the middle east where pop culture has managed to penetrate through despite the attempts by the regime to keep it under a tight leash.Year 1979:- Revolution breaks out against the Shah led by the Islamic republic, a mark key moment in the history of this nation. Shah who had the support of the Americans could not withstand this overwhelming pressure by its people, was eventually overthrown. However, the Islamic republic brings with it a ""radicalization"" of what was a relatively liberal society. It is in this backdrop we trace the journey of girl tracing her identity, question the authority and breaching it in some cases, but eventually submitting to the reality of the situation. The movie is a very commendable adaptation of the acclaimed graphic comic books , staying true and pushing the intentions of the original work. The triumph of the film is the feminine perspective of the protagonist from her childhood memories, to her juvenile delinquencies, to her personal battles with the system have been very aptly portrayed.Year 2009:- A similar revolution has broken out as I write this. It is interesting to watch this film as Iran is on the cusp of another change."
121,Persepolis,8,24 April 2009,Wonderful animated film covering the development of a young individual amidst an increasingly pressured situation.,"Persepolis is a quite brilliant film telling the quite brilliant journey of one girl on her travels. These travels are physical in the sense she moves to specific parts of the world at specific times, but emotional, as the film finds time to detail her journey as a human being as she negates life, maturity and anything else thrown at her. Apart from most things, the film is a just a cracking ride with wonderfully rendered animation and a fantastic pacing to it; a film that finds time for style and substance in equal measure as it rolls along, delivering scenes of a frightening, humbling and sweet nature in good measure. Most might groan at the prospect of watching a French; in Persian, German and French respectively, made animated production that clocks a specific time in someone's life but develops them as a character in equal measure. Groan they might, but they are missing out on a brilliantly told and glorious film worthy of whatever praise it garners.The most remarkable thing about the film is just how much energy it has. I'll choose my words very carefully but watching it is just so much damn fun. Persepolis carries that quick-fire and ever-moving cause and effect driven feel although never feels like it's specifically trying to 'entertain' you. It's dominant aesthetics are a mixture of realism, surrealism and documentation and the film is very focused and very personal. It clocks in at just over an hour and a half but covers more ground than I've seen some films lasting half an hour longer than that do. But quite arguably, its crowning achievement is how it manages to be a piece developing one individual and yet still find time to encompass the effects of the Iranian Revolution as a whole. You can just see those out to 'get' the film with their criticisms following a reading of the log-line: ""......but a film about the Iranian Revolution ought to be about all those affected, not just one insignificant girl."" You know what? The film still finds time to look at how if affected everyone when it sends its lead back home and certain events play out. Prior to this, incompetent medical personnel and the hiding of illegal alcohol is briefly looked at.Persepolis ticks mostly all the boxes and is a testament to, what with films like: The Beat That My Heart Skipped; The Choir; Irréversible; In Paris and the Edith Piaf biography entitled 'The Little Girl', French cinema and how it is they who are consistently churning out the best and most affecting films on the planet at the current time. It sees a very lone at times but very lovable protagonist named Marjane Satrapi (voiced by Mastroianni) eventually forced out of Iran for her own safety but only after a particularly interesting set up. As a young girl, this character sees the world through very naive eyes. She has child-like dreams of wanting to be a prophet and seems to idolise a certain Bruce Lee, himself a figure  an idol, of great inspiration and recognition. If the film is all about growing up and moving on, then the film delivers its overall ideas very early on with a brief history lesson about how Iran has evolved (some at the time would've said 'matured') as a nation as different rulers and ruler's sons have come to power; before we arrive at the Revolution itself.These ideas of moving on could be linked to the notion of modernity which, in essence, is what the lead character of Marjane epitomises; the want to move on and update. This is put across through some delicate scenes revolving around the want to wear certain types of clothing and the desire to listen to certain types of music. It is this 'Westernisation' of the individual that she uses as a means to escape the horrors of warfare around her. But the film is also a study of the delicate psychosis the lead carries; a study of guilt as she lives in Vienna, Austria away from all the political atrocities back home before further developing into a romance that comes crashing down. It's during this segment that questions of her own identity are raised once again and there is a harrowing passage of film during which swooping shots of the city and beautifully done frames of reflections in rivers and so forth act as the backdrop for when Marjane becomes homeless.I don't think there can be too much debate on whether Perepolis is one of the films to see from the last year or so, animated or not. The film flies along with the same pace and level of energy any of America's recent animated efforts do, but it offers something a little more. Its co-director Marjane Satrapi, whose life this text is based on, does a brilliant job with co-director Vincent Paronnaud, and really brings to life this very personal project to the point that you feel very humbled that you're even having this story shared with you. While encompassing life, loss and times of great stress via warfare and political regulations, Perespolis is a triumph."
122,Persepolis,8,12 April 2009,Persepolis,"I would of preferred to see the version of this well animated film dubbed into English, not just because Sean Penn, Iggy Pop and Gena Rowlands are in it, but I'd understand what was going on without having to read quick subtitles. Adapted from the (autobio)graphic novel of the same name, this is a poignant French coming-of-age animated film where the protagonist Marjane reminisces about growing up during the Iranian Revolution. The film sees Marjane pulled away and reunited with her parents quite a few times, and witnessing her home country ruled by fundamentalists going into repressive tyranny. So she moves to Vienna, but she finds herself surrounded by different culture and troubling disappointment, and it seems that when she goes back it has changed too much that she questions where she truly belongs. Even in black and white (the present day bits are in colour), the elaborate French animation is most engaging, and adds some humour to the events presented, but also a slight dark side, making it most worthwhile viewing. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Animated Film and Best Film Not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!"
123,Persepolis,8,2 April 2009,The Perfect Adult Cartoon,"Persepolis is the perfect cartoon for adults. It has a satirical element to it, at time it is hilarious but still manages to enlighten the audience about serious topic (such as the occupation of the dictator Shah) all at the same time.One of my favorite funny moments is when the main character's love interest informs her that since it doesn't seem to be working with her it must not ""work for any other girls either"" and announces he is gay.One of the things that I could not understand about the film was that none of the main characters look Iranian! In fact, the main character looked like she was French.Other than that, the movie was highly enjoyable and had me laughing at the crazy predicaments that the main character found herself in."
124,Persepolis,7,30 March 2009,"PERSEPOLIS (Vincent Paronnaud and Marjane Satrapi, 2007) ***","'Realistic' animated films were mainly prevalent in the 1970s and early 1980s (recently there had also been Richard Linklater's WAKING LIFE [2001] and A SCANNER DARKLY [2006] but I have not watched either), so it was with some trepidation that I approached this acclaimed French production  especially since it dealt with politics (Iranian) that were as far removed from my interest as could be imagined! Still, I was reasonably engaged throughout because the makers (one of whom is the heroine of the autobiographical film herself[!]  this is based on a number of graphic novels detailing how her life was shaped by the political upheaval which her country experienced over the years) managed to balance their social commitment with irreverent humor (notably a number of interjections by God[!], the caricature of a Heavy-Metal gig, young kids on the street being approached with clandestine records of Western artists like Julio Iglesias and Jichael Mackson {sic} and even cartoon representations of recognizable figures such as Godzilla, Arnold Schwarzenneger in ""Terminator"" mode and the ageing hero of popular German TV police series ""Inspector Derrick""!). The agreeably uncluttered style is quite effective and, for added measure, a number of renowned actors lent their voices to the various characters  Chiara Mastroianni (as Marjane), her real-life mom Catherine Deneuve doubling on-screen in that capacity as well and Danielle Darrieux as her spirited grandmother (in the English-dubbed version, we even got to hear Sean Penn, Iggy Pop and Gena Rowlands!).RAGING BLUES (Lyonel Mathieu and Vincent Paronnaud, 2004) ** An earlier and (obviously much simpler) film from PERSEPOLIS (2007)'s Vincent Paronnaud, this obscurely-titled short supplies contrasting visions of city life i.e. the high class is rather obviously intercut with scenes in an underprivileged environment. More specifically, it details a slum kid's obsession with boxing  eventually fulfilled, most ironically, when the hanging body of his suicide mother is used as a punching bag!"
125,Persepolis,10,8 February 2009,A real gem,"The idea of a French black and white animation about life in revolutionary Iran doesn't sound too entertaining but in this case it is, this is an enthralling film from start to finish as it follows the ups and downs of Marji's life in Iran and Vienna.When the film opens with a woman approaching the check-in desk at Orly airport but soon we return to her childhood where she is growing up in Iran towards the end of the Shah's reign. Her family appear to be fairly well off although her uncle has been a political prisoner for several years due to his communist beliefs. When the Shah is overthrown the family is happy as the uncle is released but as time passes and the mullahs take power things start to get worse, her uncle is sent back to prison, alcohol is banned, women get less and less freedoms and Iraq launches starts a brutal war with Iran. Marji's parents decide it would be better for her if she went to a school in Vienna. Despite the political freedoms in Austria things don't go too well for her and eventually she returns to Iran although by this time she is an adult.While the political background of the film is interesting what makes it so much fun is the way Marji is such a free spirit, listening to western music, arguing with her teachers who tell her that girls must dress modestly while the boys can wear tight fitting clothes. The animation while fairly crude works very well, it is good to see a Western animated film that isn't aimed primarily at children.I found this film to be utterly delightful and would recommend it to anybody who wants to see something a little different, my comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles."
126,Persepolis,9,13 January 2009,Breaks boundaries of typical animation with preaching narrative,"Marji grows up living through the Iran revolution with many difficulties coming of age by moving out and exploring different places and lifestyles.Based on Marjane Satrapi's novel, Persepolis explores the difficulties of war, the pressures of growing up and the political agendas that cost lives in an already troubled society and not only is this an Oscar nominated picture, not only is this a fine adaptation, this is one of the finest animations to ever appear on screen and considering the lengths of Pixar's Toy Story among others, this was a challenge that was pulled off in stunning fashion to equal the Perfect Pixar geniuses.Taking the dramatic story of the young girl and turning it into an animation was an interesting choice of autobiography for Satrapi and further turning it into a major motion picture shows her charisma and bravery to reflect on the past, which is reflected through the young Marji we see on screen. Curious, energetic and impatient may seem like a description of any ordinary young child but Marji has something special about her. It is the effort she puts in and her strong opinionated beliefs that separate her into a stand alone figure. The fact that she has good and bad times helps viewers associate with the protagonist and through her beliefs and reflections we are told what is an informative and entertaining story.The beginning opens with a highly informative reflection of Marji's life and how she is growing up with the politics of Iran destroying the family's beliefs. Strong and opinionated, this opening is quite fast to take everything in at once and requires another watch to grasp all the facts but after 20 minutes the pace slows and we can appreciate the delicacy of the time as we see a truly sentimental between the child and her Uncle, which shows the animation isn't afraid to voice its opinions. Growing up Marji tackles life's challenges and it's a wonderful journey to observe.Persepolis is made into an Oscar nomination through its touching story and effective animation. But it is the direction that makes it so unique and interesting. Every scene is directed in a different way, high shots, low shots, a figure on a black backdrop, a fighting sequence and so many more this has to be the most surprising and equally entertaining directions of an animation, and probably of 2007."
127,Persepolis,9,29 September 2008,Persepolis is unlike anything you will ever see.,"This film, a Billungs-Roman of young Marjane, shown through the eyes of the Iranian Revolution, is unlike anything I have seen before. Adapted from Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel of the same name, Persepolis still retains somewhat of the comic-like feel, without the superman-type speech bubbles etc. that are in other movie adaptations. I thought the choice to do all the animation by hand enhanced the film, and made their work come alive with feeling no computer could ever create. Knowin the book, I feel like too much material was cut out in order to fit the time frame of a feature film. I felt like there should have been two or three installments, so you don't lose as much detail. This way, they could also add more of the funny, happy scenes, to make the sad and depressing ones less intense. The ending also could be less abrupt, slowing the story down beforehand, and not cutting straight to the credits, but tapering off, leaving us with less of an empty feel. I liked, however that the story ended with Marjane's realization of what her grandmother had taught her-always remember who you are, and where you come from. Overall, the film was eye-opening to the hardships and effects of war, and is an informative and entertaining way to learn about Iranian history, and travel the the lives of the less fortunate. I rate this film 9 out of 10."
128,Persepolis,9,23 September 2008,superb,"i really enjoyed this film. i thought it was so well done.it's in traditional animation and it tells the story of a little girl growing up in Iran,through the revolution,and the war with Irag,and her life beyond those events as she grows up to adulthood.the movie is touching,funny and sad,but manages not too be depressing.the animation changes from black and white to bright colours depending on what is happening in any given scene.it's narrated very well,by who i assume is the actual person the movie is about.at least it's told her from point of view.regardless,her voice is a perfect fit for the movie.in short, this is a movie that exceeded my expectation,and was well worth watching.my vote for Persepolis is a 9/10"
129,Persepolis,9,25 August 2008,"A confronting, tragic and funny tale of a woman's childhood","In an age where all the latest animated films strive to look their finest, with top of the line CGI and exquisite detail, it is odd that one is released that could have been made many years ago. Persepolis is an adaptation of an autobiographical graphic novel (of the same name) which was written by Marjane Satrapi, also the co-director. This movie is a personal look at a situation of real complexity and most definitely art of a very high order.Born into a wealthy Tehran home by her parents (voiced by Catherine Deneuve and Simon Abkarian), Marjane Satrapi (Chiara Mastroianni) was six when the Iranian Revolution began. Following this was the Iran-Iraq war, which destroyed Iran's wealth, coupled with the religious crackdowns, this killed any hope Satrapi and her family had of democratic freedom. Satrapi is consequently sent to Europe to live and study in safety, but things do not turn out as hoped, and Satrapi eventually ends up homeless and ill, whereupon she returns to a new, and still restrained, Iran.The first half of the film is the strongest, where we witness the history of Iran through a Marjane's childish eyes. She also happens to be one of the cutest and most charming characters to appear in cinemas for years. Marjane is always happy to embrace new ideas, she is always inquisitive, and she is also an avid fan of Bruce Lee and ABBA. And briefly, she believes she is a prophet of God! Furthermore, a sense of innocence is omnipresent throughout her childhood years as she perseveres through tough times.Although, that is not to say this film is cutesy for its entirety. At times this is very challenging, with the constant presence of death and loss prevalent throughout. These themes are especially present in the equally enthralling second act, where Marjane travels to Vienna and discovers love, loss, homelessness, depression and some newfound knowledge. This part is a contrast to the optimism of her earlier years. Upon returning to a transformed Iran, Marjane does not fit in and in her defiance rediscovers her zest for life.The last half is a powerful and inspiring look at Marjane's courage to stand up for rights and go against the laws. Marjane finally embraces her childhood personality and becomes herself again. All these messages and themes are supported by amazing, surreal and simple animation that is, in my opinion, far superior than any expensive CGI. The voice acting is flawless around the board and Marjane's somewhat dry humour throughout hits the spot all the time. I came out of this with a new awareness of Iran and their situation(s). It is rare a film can be this abrupt and sad, but at the same time be funny and heart-warming.4½/5"
130,Persepolis,10,13 August 2008,Not to be missed,"Marjane Satrapi has turned out over a dozen graphic novels so far; this film is based on Persepolis 1, published in 2000 - there are 3 more in this series: Persepolis 2, 3, and 4. I bought the first couple based on just seeing the preview of the movie; fell in love with her style immediately. The film brings these stories - which is Marjane's story - to life brilliantly, presenting us with some of the most stunning and original animation ever created for the screen.This is a complex movie, teeming with contradictions, and it works on all the levels it aspires to. It's hilarious, absurd, emotional, tragic, giddy, political, charming, wise, inspiring, poetic, poignant and moving to the point of being heart-breaking. It's a film that everyone should see, regardless of race, gender, class structure, religion, all the garbage that divides people - ""Persepolis"" masterfully and subversively transcends all of that by being, at its core, true to Satrapi's personal story, which becomes our story, our collective human story. Not to be missed."
131,Persepolis,9,31 July 2008,"Wonderful Film Is Much More Than Just a ""Cartoon""","Do not dismiss ""Persepolis"" as only being a cartoon. It's animated in the sense that it's not live action, but it's more serious minded and sophisticated than many a live action film out there.Marjane Satrapi wrote the source material on which this film is based, and she's its main character. It documents her troubled coming of age during a period when her home country (Iran) was experiencing a severe identity crisis. Sent to Europe by her parents when the Iraq/Iran war makes simply living in Iran dangerous, she finds that the land of democracy and bounty that Europe promises is largely a myth for people like her, looked down on as foreign and barbaric invaders. In the end, she prefers living under a militant regime to the ""freedom"" of the West.""Persepolis"" is quite tragic, really. Americans have become so conditioned to think of all Iranians as radical Muslims that we've forgotten it used to be a progressive country not that different from America. Those who are being oppressed now should not be blamed for the choices of their leaders. Would any American want to be held accountable for the attitudes and behavior of our president? But Iran is still home to these people, and they do the best to make of it what they can.The film is beautiful, with stunning and artistic animation. It's cheeky, and there are many humorous moments, but it will also break your heart.Grade: A"
132,Persepolis,10,28 July 2008,Gud Muvi Iz Not Ded,"Them Iranians never cease to amaze me, because my list of favorite Iranian movie-makers continue to grow. Every few months, I seem to come across the name of another Iranian, who makes excellent movies. Starting with Mohsen Makhmalbaf, my list grew through Abbas Kiarostami, Majid Majidi, Zafar Panahi, Samira Makhmalbaf, Bahman Farmanara, Bahman Ghobadi (OK OK, I know, he is Iranian Kurd) and now Marjane Satrapi. Damn, I hate them! Interestingly, I did not even know that this movie existed until about 72 hours ago, when I was chatting with a friend over the net, and who told me that she was going to watch this movie that day, a DVD of which she got that very day. I have faith in her taste and so went to IMDb, and found the info, and then rushed to get a copy of it.It was a very rewarding experience. I was really so fascinated that after a while, I stopped noticing that it was an animated movie. It tells the story of Fifty years of Solitude for Iran, through the eyes of a small girl, who is forced to disown her personal God and then is forced to leave her country, to live a life that somehow resembles her dreams. This movie, like all serious Iranian movies,is full of subtlety and witty, smart dialogs. In Iranian movies, they do not go with submachine guns to mow their oppressor, but expose the situation through subtle hints and calculated nonchalance.I'm sure, Persepolis will not be so appealing to many people. My colleagues laughed when I told them about it today. But then, they have no clue about the Iranian political scenario of the 20th century, or most such other boring and useless stuff.Needless to say that, I am a self-proclaimed and self-certified weirdo, and my love for subtitled movies grows by day. Over the years ,I have constantly shifted my loyalty from Hollywood to Western Europe to Eastern Europe to Iran/Cuba/Argentina etc., as far as movies are concerned, and I loved this movie too. I also strongly believe all my weird friends, who loves subtitled (and subtle) movies, and movies that make them think, would love this movie."
133,Persepolis,9,26 July 2008,Remarkable film -- don't be put off by the fact that it is animated,"I would never have seen this film except for an enthusiastic recommendation from friends whose judgment I trust. The notion that the complicated situation in Iran could be successfully explored in an animated film seemed ridiculous on its face. But ""Persepolis"" is not remotely related to Walt Disney (or any other ""cartoon"" you may have seen). It is a sensitive portrayal in suitably shadowy colors of life in Tehran seen through the eyes of a little girl/teenager/grown young woman and her family during the deposition of the Shah, the war with Iraq, the consolidation of authority under the Mullahs and the persecution of dissidents, women and university students, especially the young females. It is based on the autobiography of Marjane Satrapi (voiced, except as a child, by Chiara Mastroianni) with Catherine Deneuve as the voice of her mother and Simon Abkarian as her father. While there's a genuine plot in this film, it's the characters who are central, and they are brought to life with remarkable skill and sensitivity. Despite my friends' recommendation, I did not have high expectations for this film. But is difficult to see how it could have been improved upon with live actors. It is chiefly in French, with some Farsi, but the subtitles are clearer than in most conventional pictures."
134,Persepolis,10,8 July 2008,A vision of a very different world,"*****MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*****Persepolis is not only just an animated film or indeed a comic but one that captures one girl growing up. In the same vein as Grave of the Fireflies this film is not for children like it's cartooned looks would suggest.What we get from Persepolis is Marjana Satrapi's vision of a life consisting of struggle, control and the freedom for women to do anything scarily non existent. Captivating that the 80s and 90s are depicted in Iran in such a way of death, of war and of propaganda and ideology that I felt that this world was so backward. Marjane's way of like felt like it was stuck in a bygone era like the early 1920s to 1940s. Her imagination and creativity are brought to life and cleverly Persepolis uses black and white to convey the immense desperation, the depressed state of society in Iran and the lack of free rights of suppressed, controlled women.Animation has the advantage of permitting a pace that allows a lot to be included into a simply and honestly told story, particularly in early childhood and adolescence. Very thought inducing in seeing how atrocities and cruelties are perceived through little children's eyes, particularly little kids growing up in an environment where these acts are a normal way of life.As a teenager looking for punk music in the black market, Marjane walks through a throng of peddlers trying to sell her an assortment of trendy videos, including disguising Micheal Jackson as Jichael Mackson is genius.Communism is crushed, propaganda cast away and bloody fighting and martyrs frequently being produced. Marjane's life growing up as Persepolis shows us is a hard one full of strife. Yet for all its seriousness there is humour there also. Throughout the movie a sense of humour that is at times very sarcastic, yet very amusing. Be it sequences where she talks to God in his cloud or as a girl pestering her Uncle about his ideals and Communist past and life. Be it her making the transition from girl to woman in a very amusing sequence that shows all the joys of getting older. Sarcasm of my own there in case you failed to notice.Persepolis ends with a beautiful rendition of her grandmother and her smelling of luscious flowers put into her bra area. This for me really does show a sense of how great life can be whatever trouble there is, good is always lurking somewhere, waiting to break free. Whether it be Marjane's ill fated relationships or defiance of a teacher, or even men telling the women to cover up more and Marjane standing up to them, there are so many sides to this story Persepolis has to offer. Thus becoming in my eyes a definite masterpiece of emotion, feeling and capturing the plight and suffering not just of one woman but also of a whole nation.Simply breathtaking, Persepolis is nothing short of greatness and told in a medium bordering on simplicity yet emerging as genius."
135,Persepolis,9,25 June 2008,a beautiful and smart film,"Although this film was not a big blockbuster and was certainly not well known, it managed to pull through and receive positive critical reception as well as many awards. I think that this is the way an animated film should be. Animated films don't have to be about a sassy princess or singing animals; animation can take on a wide variety of subjects. Persepolis captured the emotions of the characters so well that sometimes you forget that you're watching simple moving drawings. Another great thing about this movie was its music, which blended classical with contemporary and made something quite good. So if you haven't seen it, rent or buy it; the film came out on DVD June 24th."
136,Persepolis,5,8 January 2008,Simplistic attempts at a history lesson - poorly made cartoon,"After hearing all this hype, I went and saw this cartoon. On the positive side, it teaches us a lot about the history of Iran, in primitive terms, so maybe some children can benefit and enhance their education by watching this. The explanations are kept simple, to the point of being painfully naive, trying to squeeze into short childish narrative several decades of the history of Iran. The cartoon is not funny, make no mistake! Several lame attempts at humor fail flat. There is a little bit of charming development of the main character, but it again is kept very simplistic and does not go into a bigger extent. Many times I was looking at the watch, quite bored, wondering how soon this cartoon would end. In summary, the cartoon is not entertaining, and the history lesson it tries to teach is rather for the first-graders."
137,Persepolis,4,25 January 2013,I thought the film was boring,I thought the film was boring because it is not a film I would normally watch also I didn't get in to the film because of it being in black and white. Good things about the film are that it uses good techniques by putting emphasis using just the colours black and white. Also the film would not work without the setting of the film being in Iran. A bad thing about the film is that it has a lot of swearing and bad treatment of women. In conclusion the film has good points but I don't like it because it is not my type of film even though it shows good techniques. i would not watch this film again but other people might enjoy it more than i did
138,Persepolis,9,8 January 2008,Very poignant and at times funny coming of age film,"The experiences Marjane go through in this mostly black and white animation film feel very real. Color appears to been used when she's going through some transition.I went in really expecting to be horrified as a kid growing up in Iran. She does show the initial elation the public felt when the Shah was overthrown. He and his father were shown as power hungry but also did their best to modernize the country. Once strict Islamic rule took over, it probably beat the French Revoluation in body count as many were deemed enemies and executed. French replaces Farsi as the language of this movie, though it's fun to experience her views of other cultures. A bad Godzilla movie is briefly shown and she make comments about the Japanese. One very funny scene has her going to the black market for tapes. She got over the Bee Gees so she buys Iron Maiden and a Michael Jackson button.She gets to leave the French school of Tehram to go to the French School of Vienna. She has her own identity crisis when thrown in the punk scene and there's a funny moment when her body changes to being a girl to a woman. Backing up a bit, she gets along much better with her grandmother than she does with her own parents, the father being rather submissive. It is her vision of her grandmother that helps her to stand up to her ethnicity.She survives the war but a love affair with a total loser brings to the brink of suicide. She goes back to Iran where it's a changed, subdued society where women are treated rudely and unfairly. She marries another loser and knows she has to leave Iran and her veiled existence.The narrative ends with Marjane in France. She tells us that she will never see her grandmother again. Such is the price of freedom. Freedom to do what? The movie doesn't answer but the very existence of it has her name as co producer. I look forward on seeing how her career goes."
139,Persepolis,9,1 January 2009,There's nothing worse than bitterness and revenge.,"At least the Golden Globes put this film up against other great foreign films like Lust, Caution; 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days; The Kite Runner; and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. It certainly belongs in that group rather than films like Ratatouille or Surf's Up as the Academy Awards determined.It is is the first animated film I recall seeing since Fritz the Cat, and it was fantastic.Of course, my opinion is colored by the fact that I abhor any totalitarian or religious regime as view them as crimes against freedom. I can certainly see why Iran wouldn't like this film as it makes them look even worse than the Bush regime. They certainly imprisoned and killed more people, but not by much.The black and white was perfect for the film, and the changing light really set the mood. The story was told perfectly with a mixture of politics, humor and personal growth and tragedy. It was simply magnificent."
140,Persepolis,8,20 July 2008,Amazing depth because of the animation,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the humor, nobility, fear and love expressed by this film. It's not despite the animation but because of it. If human characters tried to replicate this film it would just be average. The lack of overall detail drawn in the characters serves to highlight the subtle (and exaggerated) changes in their faces when they express emotion. It's similar to puppetry or reading, the imagination is captured to fill in the missing detail. The animators (from the directors on down) were top notch, I need to watch this film again just to savor the visuals.The plot is not sacrificed for the visuals either. The story is political and even though it is about Iran it's really about any country, any revolution, any wartime, any time of restricted freedom. And any coming of age. Marjane goes from child to woman and we all can relate to that, yes women probably more than men but adolescence is much the same.This film will speak to any one and so I'd recommend it for everyone."
141,Persepolis,7,3 July 2008,Whatever happened to Marjane?,"Filmmakers usually look to other art forms for inspiration for future projects. Lately, graphic novels (which are nothing like comic books) have become a popular medium to adapt into film. Last year, three noteworthy films were released which began their artistic life as graphic novels. The first of which was the acclaimed adaptation of 300, which plays as a violent video game rather than a feature-length film. The next was 30 Days of Night, and while well-made, the film lacks the characterization needed for it to move beyond its core audience. Finally, Persepolis was released in the United States and was met with deserved praise. Like Iron Man does for the comic book-adaptation, Persepolis does for the graphic-novel adaptation. It shows the viability of graphic novels to create films which can be enjoyed by those who are not only unfamiliar with the source material, but also those who don't care for graphic-novel adaptations.The film is co-directed by and stars Marjane Satrapi (though she doesn't provide her own voice). It follows her life from her early childhood in pre-revolutionary Iran until her permanent exit as a young adult. She is a young girl of upper middle class background when the Revolution begins. Her former freedoms are revoked, and she wonders in amazement of the hostility she encounters in formerly-accepted activities. No longer is she able to wear sneakers and leather jackets. Her parents send her to Austria to escape the Revolution, and Marjane isn't able to adjust to Western society. After her first boyfriend reveals his homosexuality, she enters an eerie, aloof daze. After graduating from high school, she returns to Iran and enters University. In a seemingly endless disconsolate slumber, Marjane begins to fall in love, yet again, with the wrong man. She leaves him, and later Iran, with wistful reminiscence of her childhood country.Despite the film's source material, it unfolds as a traditional coming-of-age story but with a slight twist. In most films of the genre, the young person (usually a young woman) must overcome social problems or win the approval of an adult figure. The teen angst portion of the film (young adult angst too) is familiar, but several humorous scenes help create a good balance. Pre-revolutionary adult reactions to Marjane's fascination with tidbits of global culture (see Iron Maiden and any Godzilla film) are amusing. They aren't hostile but perturbed at whatever Marjane likes at the moment. Similarly, Marjane must overcome her society's disconcerting idealism which fails to reflect reality. It's rather ironic that Marjane's parents and countless others fought in the Iranian Revolution because of a desire for more personal liberties and their effort was rewarded with even more restriction. However, despite this paradox, Persepolis is not damning of the history it portrays. Islam is not directly criticized nor is the governmental police force which harasses Marjane's family portrayed as anything other than annoying. The film does include delve into some of the faults of its heroine. Satrapi has a man arrested when he did nothing other than leer at her which frustrates her grandmother. It's refreshing to have such a realistic character in a biopic. Other recent titles have not been as faithful to their history (see Mongol and Charlie Wilson's War). It distinguishes Persepolis and is one of the reasons Marjane's story is easy to embrace.However familiar the plot appears, the film's animation is not. It is almost entirely animated in black and white. Only current segments of Satrapi's life are colorized, and these events are inconsequential to the story. Imagine taking a black and white graphic novel and filming it as you quickly turn the pages, and you'll understand how the image appears compared to other hand-drawn films. Continuing with the visual metaphor, imagine that you are drawing a simplified urban setting with flat characters in the foreground and dark shading in the back. Now you understand how the images ""look."" This creates a noir style that suits the dark subject matter well. It's also interesting how artificial the scenery is when Marjane is temporarily happy which isn't often. These sequences use paper cut-outs imposed on another image (like South Park).Persepolis is worth a look to nearly anyone. Young people will enjoy Marjane's Juno MacGuff-style reactions to various problems in her life, and older audiences will enjoy the riveting story as told by someone who lived through it. The film, at least I thought, is optimistic about Iran's future in achieving its long-desired public rule.Consensus *** and ½ out of 4"
142,Persepolis,8,8 May 2008,Not a masterpiece but pretty good,"Persepolis is,by my point of view,far away from the masterpiece a lot of a people say it is.But,still,it's a very good film with valid intentions and messages.The element I most appreciated in this movie is that it's animation with substance.By substance,I wanna say that the movie has an important message and honest drama and that's a very good achievement for an animation movie.The movie is entertaining and always interesting.There are some fails on this movie.First,the screenplay feels a little bit pretentious and forced on some moments and I also found some redundant moments.Still with that fails,Persepolis is a very competent animation film made with a substance.And that's enough reason to recommend this movie with enthusiasm."
143,Persepolis,9,10 March 2008,Jichael Mackson!,"Great great great (though my wife insists the main child character is a knock-off of Emily the Strange)! That's pure trash. Emily sucks anyway. I got pretty involved with the main character in no time and could relate to some of the stuff she experienced when I was a kid. It's made no less soft when presented in animated form but certainly enhances the absurdities and emotions the characters express. It is a great take on perception during a very chaotic time in Iran's history. Another thing that blows my mind is that turd of a movie Ratatouille beat this out for best animated picture? Huh? There's no comparison as this adult movie is for the thinking person with a darker sense of humor. Not sure if it's based on the director's real life or not but if so, a million more kudos. Worth your time for sure, especially to get the Jichael Mackson joke."
144,Persepolis,7,18 February 2008,"Starts as a 10, ends as a 5","Persepolis (2007) was written and directed by Vincent Paronnaud and Marjane Satrapi. This animated film is based on the coming-of-age graphic novel by Ms. Satrapi. In the film, Marjane--a young Iranian woman--is played by Chiara Mastoianni. Catherine Deneuve plays Marjane's mother and Danielle Darrieux is her grandmother. The film starts off in a strong, fascinating fashion. As a young girl, Marjane and her family are caught up in the struggle against the Shah. When the Shah is overthrown, the revolution falls into the hands of Islamic fundamentalists, and many of the revolutionaries, including members of Marjane's family, are imprisoned. Marjane appears to have become a young woman of strength and dignity--not easy at that time and in that place.Unfortunately, the film winds down at the midpoint. Marjane's family are able to send her to Vienna, where she makes a series of bad decisions. Ultimately, she returns to Iran and the bad decisions continue. By the time the film ends, Marjane, as portrayed, hasn't maintained the strength and dignity that made her so admirable as a young adolescent.It's hard to know how much of the story is autobiographical. If Ms. Satrapi is showing us her life, it's hard to argue that she should go back and live it differently. On the other hand, if Ms. Satrapi and Mr. Paronnaud are trying to use Ms. Satrapi's life to teach us something, or to send us a message, I don't think they've succeeded.It's too bad things turned out this way. I had high hopes for the film, and for the little girl who went through her house shouting, ""Down with the Shah!"""
145,Persepolis,5,25 January 2013,This is alright,"After watching this film it was okay not the best because I personally don't like the black and white films. Moving on the film is about and young girl that meets boys and makes new friends going around the country's whist being bombed by Iraq. The film is set in Iran in the middle of Afghanistan and Iraq at both sides they use to be a nice city but they aren't now! At the end of the film she goes to France and the movie turns back into colour again.Even when she returns home, Marji finds that both she and homeland have changed too much and the young woman and her loving family must decide where she truly belongs.Marjane is a very nice character and has an amazing personality for her family..."
146,Persepolis,6,21 June 2012,Not Bad,"PersepolisWhen I read the book, I fell in love with it. I wanted to see the move really badly. When you see the movie based on your favorite books, sometimes it lacks the same magic as the book. Persepolis is one of those book.The Pluses: GREAT animation style, the acting by all the charactersThe Minuses: Missing a lot of stuff from the book and things were a little mixed up.Overall, Perseoplis is one of those movies that somehow works. Read the book (s) to get a better understanding of this novel."
147,Persepolis,,19 July 2008,Mostly black and white primitive animation about Iranian girl.,"There are two versions of the movie ""Persepolis."" The original is in French, made in Paris. The one I saw is the English version, with different actors providing the voices over the animation for the French track. One of the actors was Iggy Pop (great Michigan voice), another was Sean Penn, another was Gena Rowlands.The movie is an outgrowth of the popular graphic novel, ""Persepolis"", which chronicles the adventures of a young girl growing up in Iran during revolution and war of the 1980s, then partly in Austria, and finally moving to France. The character Marjane 'Marji' Satrapi is based on a real person of the same name, and she is one of the writer/directors of this film.As she states in the DVD extras this is not a documentary of her life, instead the episodes are inspired by what she lived through.My wife and I watched it, our attention was held all the way through, but when it was over we thought, ""Well, that was OK, but so what?"" Maybe one has to be a fan of the graphic novel to really get into this film."
148,Persepolis,4,25 January 2013,cool,"My opinion on Persepolis is negative as I was not very interested in the film when I was watching it, to be honest I thought the film was boring as I don't like cartoon films and it was unreal as when she had the growing spurt I thought it was just weird. I couldn't follow the film and I didn't get it. But overall I wouldn't watch this film again because it's not my type as I like action films and adventure films .But I recommend this film to people that like mysterious films and films in black and white as this film would be for them REAPEAT 12.

149,Persepolis,7,30 January 2008,Slightly contained but a marvelous animated feature nonetheless,"Delightful and very unique animated film feels worthy of nearly all the acclaim garnered around the world, even if this coming-of-story of a young Iranian girl in the 80's is being oversold because of it's originality. Given that the stylish, though budgeted, feature drawn mostly in black and white chronicles, with unexpected humor and more then a few western cultural bridges, the upbringing of this young woman (co-writer and original comic book superhero Marjane Satrapi) has rarely made for a more universally engaging animated feature for grown-ups, rightfully nominated against it's polar opposite, Pixar's shiny, expensive Ratatouille.What Persepolis lacks in monetary funding however, it more then makes up with in heart and style. Despite the animation itself leaving much to be desired at times, some of the war-torn imagery is presented in visually arresting ways, making the most out of the minimalist black and white style.The whole thing could have been put together in a slightly more compelling way, so as to not evoke feelings of a cheap Saturday morning cartoon in times of transition, but working with what they had, I'd say Vincent Paronnaud and company did an outstanding job at giving this obscure comic book an adaptation us westerners could relate to."
150,Persepolis,7,26 January 2008,Future Prophet with shaved legs,"Greetings again from the darkness. Just another in the long line of politically charged, autobiographical French films with English subtitles based on the Iran Revolution and filmed in Black and White animation with Iron Maiden references.Based on co-writer and co-director's Marjane Satrapi's autobiography of the same name, this one provides a glimpse into Iran after the fall of the Shah. As the old saying goes: be careful what you wish for, you might get it.Unlike anything I have ever seen on screen, Ms. Satrapi provides some insight into what struggles the Iranian people went through during this terrible time. Of course this is through the eyes of an adult looking back on her childhood, so we are given a very frightening picture indeed.The story is allowed to drag in a few spots, but overall, the uniqueness of delivery maintain the interest and Ms. Satrapi makes for a captivating lead character ... even in animated form."
151,Persepolis,10,29 April 2017,Assessment of Marjane Satrapi's ability to convey struggles of childhood in Iran,"In their 2007 film, Persepolis, directors Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud's retells the events of Satrapi's life while growing up in and experiencing life in Iran before and after the revolution of 1979. Satrapi and Paronnaud implement a minor genre style in the form of animation that recreates the significant events and hardships of Satrapi's life, and successfully communicates the emotions associated with them, if not more effectively than a life-action film (Weber-Fève 322). By analyzing the animated style of Satrapi and Paronnaud's film, there are certain conclusions to be made regarding the film's ability to effectively address political and social issues through a more creative adolescent perspective as they grow up in a rapidly changing and increasingly oppressive country. In the scene in which Marjane wakes up and begins to undergo a rapid physical transition into maturity, various parts of her body begin to unrealistically transform and grow into unusual and grotesque shapes and sizes until her body is seemingly full-grown and, once again, proportionate. This scene demonstrates the power of animation as a tool for reducing time and creatively portraying an ordinary and awkward stage in one's life while giving it a comical treatment. The exaggerated and comical style of recreating and accelerating the stages of growing up as portrayed in this scene enables the audience to further identify with Marjane as a growing adolescent, thus suggesting that this scene might not have been as well received by the audience or as effective if instead live-action was used. This scene also serves as a transitional point in the film in which Marjane's rapid maturation also indicates that she is now subject to the oppressive laws against showing any exposed skin other than the face and is instead forced to don a concealing and overbearing hijab. The majority of this film being in black and white, despite the creative freedom of animation allowing for any number of colors to be used, further evokes the sense of an increasing void in Marjane's life in which she grows more and more scornful of her home country and its newly introduced laws (Weber-Fève 324). In the scene in which all of the students at her school gather in an auditorium to discuss the strict dress code for women, the scene opens to an image of the segregated female and male students. The variety of clothing worn by the men as contrasted with the homogeneously dressed women that are almost impossible to tell apart due to their black, over-sized hijabs. This scene is effective at highlighting the encroaching political and religious agendas of the Iranian government following the revolution through the plain contrast of the animated men and women. The use of animation enables this scene to exaggerate the increasing lack of individuality and feeling of oppression that women in Iran are experiencing, and would likely not have been as effective had the directors decided to use live-action characters instead. The film Persepolis recounts the events leading up to and following the Iranian revolution which led to the introduction and strong enforcement of clothing laws that only targeted the women of Iran. By predominantly using a black and white color scheme for this film, director, Satrapi and Paronnaud, are able to effectively convey the lack of creativity and austere principles that govern women to appear as shapeless, black blobs with plain faces rather than express their individuality. The animated style of this film contributes to its effectiveness in exaggeratedly portrayed certain events from Marjane's life which made them seem more comical and relatable. This film, which is exemplar of an animation that effectively addresses social and political issues, as well as everyday problems, proves that live-action films are not always more effective at addressing significant worldly issues (Weber-Fève 325). As evidenced by this film, animation serves as a powerful tool for analyzing a number of situations while also allowing for the creative freedom to ironically portray a world that oppresses creativity.Work Cited Weber-Fève, Stacey.

152,Persepolis,9,19 October 2016,A really brilliant movie about a young girls journey as a Muslim........,"I liked how the story went with a girl who came out of a war country such as Iran to experience the world around her. It is hard when you see world wars around you and being picked on for not behaving what a typical Muslim woman should do. It does make me feel really sad that its still going on where a Muslim woman doesn't have rights for herself whereas the husband controls everything. With Marjane, she knew well that her marriage wasn't going to work but at least, she had family support and continued with the divorce. I really like her character, she just is really brave and very quirky to be living as a Muslim independent woman. If only some Muslim girls had the opportunity to be free and get out there to experience the world around them. It would be great if every man, woman and child to be able to have rights in all countries and all religons. Its just too bad that some countries don't have womens or any rights at all. We certainly do live in a sad world of hatred, harmful and stupidity!I really like how this movie is done and I certainly give this a 9/10!"
153,Persepolis,7,24 July 2013,"Great As Art, If Not Necessarily In Teaching History","Artistically, it's great-a graphic novel that is not converted to live-action, but instead stays a series of drawings with enough animation to keep it going without it turning into a silly cartoon. The pace is perfect, too; it neither dawdles or rushes too fast. Also, the characters and settings are just detailed enough to make everyone and everything distinctive. Scenes of violence such as bombing, shootings, and tank advances take care to convey the message without being too gruesome.So how is the movie, story-wise? It is the autobiographical story of a young rebellious girl who is part of an upper-class family in Iran, many of whom are also rebels, not only politically but also socially. Some manage to fly under the radar while others end up imprisoned, tortured, and killed. They rebel against the hated Shah and rejoice in his overthrow, only to find the new Islamist regime far worse. The girl is sent to Austria to live with a relative and go to school in her teens, but the relative has her leave and sends her to a Catholic school, and she and the people around her do not get along very well. She becomes ill and homeless, and returns to Iran-but finds herself no happier there either.The story is credible, but a lot of important information is left out. How did the girl's family become upper-class, and how did it evidently stay that way despite all the social and political turmoil? Why did they stay in Iran despite everything? The film criticizes the West, but completely omits the taking of the US Embassy (in complete violation of international law) and the kidnapping and torture of the embassy staff? I guess the producers of the film hated questions like that."
154,Persepolis,8,21 October 2012,"Interesting, but nothing really special","So here we have, an above average film about the life of a girl in Iran, oh, so what makes it an 8.0 on IMDb? The fact that it is animated instead of life action? Clearly, the people here know nothing of the massive Japanese Anime industry to think that an animated drama film is ""special"" because it is ""animated"". Of course, most people outside of Japan never saw a serious animated film, but that's because most people are ignoramus who do not know much of cinema. Wanna see an animated drama? Try ""Only Yesterday"", by Isao Takahata, a film a million times superior to this one. This one is interesting only to the ignorant people in the ""west"": it is just a above average drama that happens to be animated. Its good, but I do not recommend it before thousands of other films."
155,Persepolis,9,24 March 2012,Wonderful,"I knew I was going to like and appreciate Persepolis, and I not just liked and appreciated the film, I loved it. The animation is stylish and unique and the music really adds to the atmosphere. Persepolis is wonderfully written with some humorous moments among the many moving and thought-provoking ones, and the autobiographic(with emphasis on philosophy, culture and morals without it ever feeling as though it was preachy or overly-didactic) story is compelling with a powerful last scene and a deft exploration of the regime. The characters have a certain realism and humanity to them, especially Marjane, and the voice acting is very impressive especially from Catherine Deneuve. Overall, a wonderful film, innovative and very involving, altogether wonderful. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
156,Persepolis,7,17 June 2009,"I know that I am not with the majority on this one, but...","I know that I am not with the majority on this, but I was not bowled over by PERSEPOLIS. In fact, the only reason I scored the film as high as 7 was because of the simple but effective artistic style. The animation was somewhat reminiscent of Charles Addams' drawings and most of the film was done in simple black & white.As for the story, the idea of showing the history of modern Iran from the Revolution of 1978 through the 1990s was a great idea. The Iranian government protested against the showing of this film because they don't want any open discussion or dissent. However, I feel that its important to be open and honest about their ""people's revolution"" and what it is like to live in this country today. Good for the film makers to address the effects of this Islamist government on the everyday lives of its people.However, this brings me to what I didn't like and why I just couldn't get super-excited about the film. In most films, I want to be able to connect with the leading character--to respect and care about them. However, after a while, the young lady in the film just seemed like an incredibly selfish and difficult to like person. Because of this, the film was confusing and just seemed to drag. You see in the second half of the film that as the girl matured, she showed that she wasn't exactly a person to be admired. I was especially horrified when she sent the religious police after some innocent guy just to divert suspicion away from herself...and later laughed about it! The guy could have been beaten or arrested--you'll never know.Overall, an interesting portrait--at least for the first half. Then, it, like the nation, loses direction and becomes a film that should have been named ""Rebel Without a Cause"".By the way, there is an English language and a French language version--I saw the French one with subtitles."
157,Persepolis,9,14 June 2008,One of the best films of 2007,"""Persepolis"" is one of the saddest films of the year. It's not a tragedy because of the brutal, shameful loss of a young girl's brave, radical family members, or because of her nation's appalling depravity, but because of how the nation's wickedness has taken a young, frivolous girl, (Marjane) and forced her to abide to a hostile social environment, and because we know that any prospect or hope for a better future will amount to nothing but bearing lives in dread and fear of the malevolent corruption that surrounds them. It's a tragedy because the young girl's realization of all the evil in the world is mercilessly relatable, how she was snatched from her childhood and immediately forced to lead a mellow life, it's something many of us have experienced, but not without comfort from our family or society as a whole. Marjane receives no comfort, she is forced to tolerate this new life she's unprepared for, forced to seclude her pain and ache to be a child once more.Who was once a young girl, fascinated by daydreams of one day becoming a prophet, becomes a desolate mere statistic after she realizes the bitter truth that the flawed, bigoted society around her will never grant her a chance to live a normal life. She tries to find reliance and hope through relationships, but none has yet to ever work for her, she is rejected by her lover, like millions of other people every year. Eventually, she leaves her country to make a better life for herself in France.I predict that Marjane will finally find the man for her, and bear children so that maybe one of her descendants will experience freedom at last, and rejoice her family name. The film was such a moving, poignant, at times hilarious, honest experience, certainly among the year's best, and certainly robbed of its Oscar."
158,Persepolis,9,28 May 2008,This is what cinema is for,"The last days of the Shah and the Iranian ""Revolution"" are seen through the eyes of spirited young girl. The amount of humour worked in with the grimness is astonishing. The animation style, although highly restricted, never becomes boring. Use of music is excellent. I think it's important for all of us to know what it's like being personally involved in a ""revolution"". The picture which emerges is very clear. All extreme ideologies are just excuses for bullying. Since I've started preaching, I should add that we should all make the effort to go and see French films, because the Americans couldn't make a film as good as this in a thousand years. If we don't pay to see films like this, no-one will make them. I've deducted one star because I think the Vienna section slightly overlong, but don't let that put you off."
159,Persepolis,,27 May 2008,Unusual subject; unusual format; unusual success,"Movie-making is still overwhelmingly a male business with most directors being male and most films telling a male story, so it is a refreshing change here to see a female co-writer and co-director (Marjane Satrapi) telling a female tale (actually her own). Even more unusual is the setting (modern day Iran) and the format (black and white animation), so this a movie that is especially memorable and moving, by turns being tragic and amusing and at all times unremittingly political and feminist.The original film is in French and based on a graphic novel written in French and drawn by Satrapi who has now lives in the Marais district of Paris with her Swedish husband, but the version I saw was dubbed into (American) English. This works well for a animated feature - there's no problem with lip-syncing and the technique allows one to concentrate fully on the impressive graphics.""Persepolis"" - named after the ancient capital of Persia that was ransacked by the troops of Alexander the Great - was nominated for an Academy Award in the section for Best Animated Feature and, while it never stood a chance against ""Ratatouille"", this is still an exceptional work that deserves a large audience."
160,Persepolis,7,25 April 2008,Superb animated socio-political elegy,"A funny, frightening and rather forlorn flick. It's difficult to decide whether it's actually intended as a political satire (it covers Iranian society and government from the 1970s to the present) or as a more conventional rite-of-passage movie with the social turbulence as a backdrop. The crushing denouement renders it the former.There's very little to criticise directly. The one problem I have with this film is the same as that for The Simpsons: it's a 2-dimensional form and as such it really can't quite sustain a sense of development to correspond with a 90-min storyline.That said, the voiceovers are excellently judged and the artwork's first rate. The story is told at a measured satirical pace, alternating its outrage with both sharp and warm good humour. An enjoyable film about the depressingly familiar. 7/10"
161,Persepolis,,9 March 2008,The luxury of freedom,"After watching « Persepolis », I couldn't help thinking about the importance of freedom. As a girl living in Europe currently and who was born in a westernized and developed city in the south of China, Macau, it never occurs to me that freedom could be a luxury in many countries of the world. Without freedom, you are psychologically imprisoned. Our heroine, Marjane, shows such problems of Iran after the Islamic Revolution vividly in ""Persepolis"". In Iran, women are obliged to cover themselves up from head to toe, single women are forbidden to have any physical contact with the opposite sex in public, freedom of speech is inexistent, news and music from the western world is, politically speaking, hard to get. As a girl who was inspired by her revolutionist uncle, Marjane does not have any choices but to leave her homeland. And in this wisely written film, we see also the problems that Marjane faced when she lived in Europe  shortly speaking, ""there is nothing like home"". Marjane had to return to Iran as a result of her painful experiences in Europe. However, when she returned to Iran after years of living in Europe, she was never the same, she was different, she was westernized, her old friends and relatives were all curious about the new Marjane. And after a hasty marriage in Iran and some efforts of trying to adapt to her home country, she had to leave again, although ""nothing is like home"", although identity crisis would surely engulf her again living in Europe, she must leave her home although that is where only her beloved family can be found, because freedom is a luxury in Iran and what Marjane cannot live without in her life is freedom.In a simple and wise black and white animated film, our heroine introduces to us the history of Iran in these last decades and reminds us, those who might have taken freedom and peace for granted in the developed parts of the world, who might be abusing freedom from time to time unconsciously, how lucky we are."
162,Persepolis,,5 February 2008,Juno stripped.,""". . . an unrealistic face of the achievements and results of the glorious Islamic Revolution."" The Iranian government on Persepolis The graphic novel tradition transposed to film animation set in a stark black and white mise en scene has always interested me with its daring to minimize narrative and yet willingness to dramatize some great issues of life (Sin City is one of the US's versions). Persepolis, an Oscar nominee for best animated feature of 2007, is just such a film: wise about the vagaries of life for an emerging girl in Iran but bold in the parallels to girls everywhere, a Juno stripped of verbal genius, if you will..This is the autobiography of Marjane Satrapi, whose four graphic novels depict a feisty Iranian girl living through the fall of the Shah, the Iran/Iraq war, the rise of the theocracy, and the eventual suppression of women's rights in a tumultuous society at the crossroads of global evolution.Besides its reliance on universal issues for emerging girls (she smokes, swears, criticizes her parents, loses at love, loses her virginity, loves her rebellious grandmother, wastes time on TV, visits clubs, lives poorly on her own in Viennathis could happen in Columbus), Persepolis dares to suggest that booking out from home won't always be the best plan. Its singular gift is its willingness to be honest about the challenges between childhood and adolescence, and of course young adulthood.Its sagging middle, with quotidian annoyances and few triumphs of a young woman, is the only caution I give for an otherwise engrossing story about coming of age.Along the way, the audience gets a cogent history of a changing little country, whose current nuclear ambitions make it not so small at all. Nor is the life of Marjane, whose covered Islamic head cannot conceal the mind of a new generation bent on change that makes America's small change by comparison.Although Persepolis will never beat Ratatouille for the Oscar, its execution stands much taller than a mouse and larger than any one character."
