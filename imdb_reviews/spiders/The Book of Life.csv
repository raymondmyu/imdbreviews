0,The Book of Life,10,20 October 2014,Perfect for kids but even better for adults,"First lets; clarify; I am not Mexican nor any in my family and friend group; however it has been a long long time since we catch kids movie able to captivate 5,6,7 or 8 year old girls and boy and the parents that took them. Just the quality, colors and artistry of the images; makes the movie worth; but the subject matter is even more impressive. How many times you were able to really laugh on a subject matter like death and make children (and adults) happy with an adventure that is pure entertainment but also gives a quite poetic look at life and dead. In brief; take your children to see it as an excuse; you probably will enjoy it even more. Forget PIXAR formula products; this is just a masterpiece"
1,The Book of Life,9,15 October 2014,Don't miss this special animated film!,"This is a beautiful animated film. Very unique in comparison to other animated films out there. I loved that it had funny parts - for adults as well as kids - but it isn't a silly comedy. It is a gorgeous, epic folkloric tale of family, tradition and finding your own way. I laughed and cried, and my kids loved it as much as I did. My kids (ages 3.5 and 5.5) both were entranced and never got bored or scared watching this film. For families: it wasn't scary at all. I worried maybe the ""skeleton"" painted Day of the Dead characters may be creepy but they weren't at all. The sets and characters were all very beautiful and unique. The Land of the Remembered was especially visually stunning. I found it especially touching as a parent of young kids with numerous generations in ""our village"" helping raise my kids and help carry each other through life's highs and lows. I was reminded by this film of the importance of all the generations that came before us - how we are shaped by our families. How we learn from and must respect those who came before us. That was a nice message for me and my kids. But, it also shows that, while we respect, learn from and inherit gifts from our fore-bearers, we also have a responsibility to be true to ourselves, to make our own way and find our true calling. It was also touchingly romantic. It felt very genuine and warm throughout but the sweet romantic story was especially touching. You could tell a lot of love went into making this film. I hope it does well - it should on its own merit!"
2,The Book of Life,9,19 October 2014,Fantastic Halloween Fun!  Superb Animation,"It's October and it is usually the time for Halloween themed movies. Unfortunately for us, Halloween has been reduced to cheap horrors, or repetitive thrillers that are a bit of a bore. This year has been slightly different, but this reviewer would like the studios to go back in the past and pull some more seasonal themes to entertain us. Well, someone got my vibe, because my last review is on a film that captures the festive fun that Halloween is for the young and young at heart. So sit back my friends and catch my latest review on the animated feature The Book of Life. I'll start this review with talking about the story. The Book of Life has a fantastic tale that centers on the typical complication of a love triangle between characters Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zoe Saldana), and Joaquin (Channing Tatum). Now we know the typical elements involved in this type of plot, but this film deviates from the typical and gives a little more pep around the story. From the start you get the backstory on each character, and the individual struggles they each face. Then they take these qualities and exploit them by bringing in the two masters of the underworld, who make a wager as to who will win the girl. The result of this wager, makes for an interesting romantic tale that is fun, emotional, and more realistic than half the dramas we get these days. However, the movie does not stop there, instead it ties in an adventure and blends it into all the aspects, making for a fun film. Once more, the whole tale revolves around the Mexican celebration of the day of the dead, bringing a unique take on the classic Halloween tale and providing a little education as well. The story isn't the only thing influenced by the Mexican culture though, the artistic style of the movie is also heavily influenced. The Book of Life is sort of a modern day Nightmare Before Christmas where CGI takes the place of stop motion animation. Many of the elements are similar, with the skeletons and landscapes sharp and angular to mirror the darkness of the afterlife. However, unlike Tim Burton, this director chose to liven things up a little by veering from the dark colors and adding wide splashes of colorful. This is not only to catch your eyes, but also to mirror the celebration that Day of the Dead is about and that life doesn't end as long as you are remembered. In the Underworld especially the color comes out, and the festivities are brought to full fold in the magical realm of the dead. Deep in the land of the Forgotten, the oblivion of elimination is presented by a frozen cavern where hope is nonexistent. Regardless, the worlds are diverse and fun, filled with ancient Central American influences that were a welcomed change. Even the characters have pizazz to them, each main character standing out in their own unique way. I in particular liked the Queen of the underworld, impressed with the blend of partying, happy, and death all wrapped into one package. The ruler of the Forgotten Land, was also of unique design, sharp, dark edges in shades of purple, neon green, and crimson to portray the darkness of his soul. What else makes this movie fun? The next aspect is the comedy, which for the most part is well timed and well delivered. There isn't much unique writing or witty humor in this movie, but more in how it is delivered. Countless puns are shouted in ridiculous voices, often followed by a character face planting into an object. What's even better is that the comedy is also diverse and spread out instead of following the typical style of beating a joke to death, the exception being Joaquin's obsession with mustaches. In addition to the comedy, the music also brings some thing to the film. Most of the numbers are covers of famous songs, some done horribly to be funny and others that are very relevant to the plot. A couple of the original numbers made my emotions go on a ride, as happiness, sadness, and even love all came together in the instruments and voice. Now most won't find it as powerful as Frozen, but for this reviewer it was nice having the music around the movie, not the opposite way around. Aside from the singing, the voice acting is incredible, each of the cast capturing the essence of the stereotypical Mexican character. Now there are too many to write about so let me pick my three favorites. First is Christina Applegate, the girl has got sass, spunk, and compassion all at work in her tour guide character. The girls sells the story as she uses the wooden puppets, which are represented in the character design, to craft the tale, keeping the kids in line, and yet showing empathy. Then there was Zoe Saldana who has the feisty Mexican girl zest that shows everyone girls don't need men to save them. Her voice is suave and full of passion, and exactly the buffer needed amidst the rowdy, rough voices of the cast. Finally the Queen of the Dead was my favorite character, and Kate del Castillo does a nice job bringing the character to life with flare, kindness, and the ability to hold her own. What can you take away from my sporadic rambling? The Book of Life is one of the better animated films I've seen in a while. It's Halloween fun, with colorful worlds and characters that balance out the predictable and limited tale. I strongly recommend seeing this movie in theaters, possibly in 3-D. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in quite some time, and I believe most will enjoy the adventure at hand. My scores for this film are: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.5 Movie Overall: 9.0"
3,The Book of Life,9,27 November 2014,"Life, Death and Love","While I have to admit I'm not exactly the greatest Jorge R. Gutierrez fan (In fact, I strongly disliked his series ""El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera"") I found ""The Book of Life"" to be a pretty enjoyable flick, with very good animation (The art style of Jorge R. Gutierrez looks surprisingly good in the CGI format, with stylish designs and impressively detailed sceneries.) likable characters and a fun story which balances very well the comedy, romance and adventure.The musical aspect was quite good too. Against what I was expecting, the use of modern songs was moderate, and each one of the musical moments this movie has serves in some way or another for the plot and character development, with more than effective results. This aspect, combined with all the other positive qualities this movie has serve to make it a very good animated film for the whole family.There is too much to like about ""The Book of Life"". For me, it was definitely a pleasant surprise, and while I'm not entirely sure to consider this the best animated film of the year 2014, it is definitely a strong contender for that category, along with ""The Lego Movie"" and ""How to Train your Dragon 2"". Definitely worth- watching.9/10"
4,The Book of Life,8,19 October 2014,Proud Showcase of Mexican Culture,"Musical Manolo, scrappy Joaquin and smart Maria are three close childhood pals. Maria gets sent to Europe to study. Joaquin gets seriously into training as a military officer. Manolo is discouraged by his father from his musical aspirations, forcing him instead to take up bullfighting, which is the traditional Sanchez family occupation. When Maria returns to town after several years, Joaquin and Manolo vie for her heart. Meanwhile, the two lords of the underworld, La Muerta (mistress of the Land of the Remembered) and Xibalba (master of the Land of the Forgotten) take a bet as to who Maria will end up with. On the Day of the Dead, the deities interfere with the outcome, leading to an adventure which will bring the characters from the land of the living to the land of the dead and back.The most striking feature of this film is the animation style. The human characters are made to look like wooden puppets. This artworks were so ingeniously crafted such that each character is distinct from each other. The three main human characters all look very good and noble. The supporting characters are rather on the ugly, distorted side in their rendition, and these may need getting used to. The background artwork is no less spectacular. The highlight of the whole film are those scenes in the Land of the Remembered, showing it as a happy bustling and festive place. The colors were so vibrant and rich. The multi-layered designs were so intricate and meticulous in their endemically Mexican-inspired details. Another wonderful feature of this film is the musical score, written by Argentine composer Gustavo Santaolalla. This musician has been awarded the Oscar two times before for films ""Babel"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" The soundtrack also employs the most unexpected pop songs, sung Mexican style of course. Hearing a familiar song being sung makes me smile and even sing along. The sensitive singing voice of Diego Luna (as Manolo) makes songs as diverse as Radiohead's ""Creep"" to Elvis' ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" sound so good.I believe this film had a lot of educational value in it for the young audience it targets. There are a lot of Latino values being tackled here about friendship and family, the status of women, the respect for the dead, etc., which are likewise universal as well, more often than not. It also introduces us, both kids and adults alike, to the vibrant Mexican culture, especially about their Day of the Dead.The pace of the film was slow at first, but once you get into its groove, you will surely enjoy the eventful ride. My two sons with me, as well as the much younger kids in the theater with us, all seemed to enjoy the film very much as you hear a lot of gleeful laughter at the some of the shallower jokes. This was despite the rather macabre subject matter and several grotesque-looking (albeit in a comical way) characters. It also had humorous moments that only adults would chuckle at. Aside from Diego Luna, the line-up of voice actors surprisingly included Zoe Saldana as Maria and Channing Tatum as Joaquin. I would not have guessed. Other familiar names such as Ron Perlman and Christina Applegate are also on board. The most unexpected name I saw on the list though was that of Ice Cube as the sunshiny fluffy underworld character named Candlemaker. Some well-known Latino actors like Hector Elizondo, Danny Trejo and Placido Domingo voice the more mature characters, like Manolo's dad and ancestors.Overall, ""The Book of Life"" is a very unique animated feature film. The basic story is based on Mexican folklore and traditions, so the animation style had the colors, designs and style of Mexico. The different look and unfamiliar references may turn off some less adventurous viewers, but really it should not. This is one very educational and very entertaining film for all ages. Writer and Director Jorge R. Gutierrez was able to successfully expand on his experience on Nickelodeon's frenetic award-winning animated series ""El Tigre:The Adventures of Manny Rivera"" (which he also created) and here proudly showcased his beloved Mexican roots on a much bigger platform. 8/10."
5,The Book of Life,9,10 October 2014,Really funny movie,"Saw the movie as part a screening tonight with my sister, her friend, and my daughter (age 12). We all really enjoyed the movie. I laughed a lot and teared up a few times. Song choices were so funny sometimes. If you're like me and in your thirties, you will definitely recognize several of the song choices. When certain ones popped up (no names, as I don't want to spoil anything), the parents all started laughing so hard. My daughter enjoyed the movie so much that she wanted to go and see it again. It had some pretty good life lessons sprinkled in throughout the humor and songs. If your child is pretty young, there may be parts of the movie that scare them just a bit (it is a movie about the dead, after all) and a couple jokes that are aimed more at adults. I highly recommend this movie."
6,The Book of Life,8,19 October 2014,A real Halloween treat,"Book of life is one of the most colorful and original set designs I have every seen in an animated movie, especially in that is CGI animation.This movie toke a real surrealistic style to the character design in order to pay homage to Mexican culture.It's a classic fairy tale being told in a story within a story manner, with a museum tour guide telling a group of kids a fairy tale of three children who lives will effect the center of the universe, aka Mexico, when Gods gamble on what type of people they would be as adults.Although as a semi-musical, the Glee approach in mixing in original content with contemporary hits kind of lessened the originality of the flick, but as a whole the movie was quite entertaining."
7,The Book of Life,10,21 November 2014,Best animated film - a must see & a true masterpiece!,"This movie was absolutely stunning and for many reasons - from the characters, to the designs in their clothing, the different lands, the gods, everything was just so pleasing to look at. I felt that the character development was immaculate. As I was watching, I had become very attached to each character and it was so easy to be fully immersed in the story. You went through all the emotions and feelings with the cast, and the voice acting was just so very believable. Diego Luna's singing was captivating as you didn't have to question if his emotion was real. The music itself was gorgeous and deserves so much recognition, I especially enjoyed the mariachi renditions, I found them fun and catchy, some even better than the originals. There is a modern mix of songs but I have to say it was complimentary to the plot and was what I would consider a little something for the adults in the audience. The story was something you would think Walt Disney himself would have given a thumbs up for. The plot and overall story telling was phenomenal. There was something for everyone - romance, comedy, heart warming moments, and action as well as adventure all nestled into a positive message you can take away from it.In summation, this movie deserves many awards as it embodies the whole package. It was outstandingly well made and thought out, and the casting was wonderful. I hope that it receives all the recognition it deserves. I recommend this film to everyone and I will most definitely be picking up my copy when it is released. I feel as though this movie far surpasses any of the most recent Disney films, with Beauty and the Beast being the only contender. I rate this movie 10/10"
8,The Book of Life,9,24 October 2014,Spectacular,"24 October 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Morning - The Book of Life. An unusual animation from the stable of Jorge R Gutierrez. Joaquin, Maria and Manolo are best friends who are torn apart when Maria is sent to Europe to calm her wild ways. The two boys are both in love with her and when she returns, they compete for her affections unaware their lives are being controlled by the two Lords of the Underworlds, who have set a wager on the outcome of their love triangle. La Muerta is the mistress of the beautiful and vibrant Land of The Remembered, whilst Xibalba is the discontented ruler of the Land of The Forgotten. The characters were portrayed as wooden puppet style people, yet when they entered the Land of The Remembered they became exquisitely carved skeletons. The animation was amazing. Apart from all the characters in in three lands I found myself avidly watching the backgrounds. The colours were so vibrant and the details were so beautifully worked. This film was set around the Mexican Day of The Dead and the whole feel of it came across as one glorious fiesta. Another animation triumph and a spectacular musical score to match."
9,The Book of Life,9,27 January 2015,Aggressively charming and visually creative,"THE BOOK OF LIFE is produced by Guillermo del Toro, directed by Jorge Gutierrez, and features an outstanding voice cast to tell its story of true love (along with a generous helping of Mexican culture). The basic plot is about two boys, Joaquin (Diego Luna) and Manolo (Channing Tatum), who vie for the affections of a girl, Maria (Zoe Saldana). As people they're fairly opposite, with Manolo being a musician at heart (his family's profession is bullfighter) and Joaquin being a soldier who does great deeds of derring-do. Unbeknownst to them, however, Lady Muerte and Xibalba (Ron Perlman) have entered into a wager about which of them can win the heart of Maria and it sets Manolo on a journey that will take him to both realms of the dead. First, I should say that the character design, animation and overall look of the film was extremely creative and visually unique, befitting a Guillermo del Toro production. The colors popped and everything in the world of the film was brought to vibrant life. The voice cast was equally impressive, although there were a couple of people who took me out of it for a little bit before getting sucked back into the story. The biggest offender was probably Ice Cube, who voices the Candlemaker, although they did stick in a couple of good jokes and references for him. I also got taken a little bit out of the story by realizing that Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin also voiced characters in the film, but again, they still did great work here. Another high point was the music. The score was pretty good, but what really stood out was the use of modern pop songs in what is (mostly) a period piece set at an indeterminate time in the past. Of course, I didn't mind that one bit at all. I also thought that the first half to two-thirds of the story were excellent. It succeeded telling an emotionally moving story with plenty of interesting characters, but at a certain point it resorted to the standard climax and resolution that wrapped up everything with a nice little bow. And despite much of the humor working, at times I felt it was a little too silly for its own good. Still, at the end I was completely won over. Had I seen this last year, I'm fairly certain it would have made my top ten. As it stands, this was an incredibly charming and visually rich film that should appeal to kids and adults alike, and also serves as a valuable cultural lesson."
10,The Book of Life,7,31 October 2014,"Messy and overstuffed, but crackling with life, energy and colour.","Many things could have gone wrong with The Book Of Life. This boisterous, big-hearted animated film is bursting with ideas and colour, stuffed to the brim with - one suspects - pretty much every idea that struck writer-director Jorge Gutierrez's fancy. Indeed, the final film plays very much like the charming but unpolished debut of a filmmaker who can't quite believe he was lucky enough to get the attention of producer Guillermo del Toro, and has no intention of wasting the opportunity in case it never comes around again. As a result, The Book Of Life practically trembles with too many ideas and influences, but remains so earnest and inventive that it's easy to forgive its predictable, overstuffed plot.In a small Mexican town on the Day Of The Dead, we meet the protagonists of the story: steadfast, earnest Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna), who would rather strum a guitar than fight a bull in the tradition of his forefathers; brash, adventurous Joaquin (Channing Tatum), who becomes the town hero in trying to avenge the murder of his father by bandits; and spunky, intelligent Maria (Zoe Saldana), daughter of the mayor who inevitably wins the hearts of both young men. The stakes, however, are higher than they could ever imagine: the two godly rulers of the underworld, La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) and Xibalba (Ron Perlman), have gambled dominion over each other's lands on the outcome of the love triangle.It would be an understatement to say that there's a lot going on in The Book Of Life. The film covers everything from a mystical medal that lends invulnerability to anyone who wears it, to a tantalising love-hate relationship between the two gods, while spiced up with musical interludes galore. (It's not often that the film's hero will pause to belt out a soul-searching rendition of Radiohead's Creep, but that kind of thing happens all the time in The Book Of Life.) Mix it all up with retellings of Mexican folklore, including visits to the joyously colourful Land of the Remembered and the ghostly grey Land of the Forgotten, and the film can be a somewhat frenetic viewing experience, to say the least.But, for all that Gutierrez packs his film full of ideas and details, he also manages to make most of it work very well. The love triangle may be trite, but there's nevertheless enough heart and humour holding Manolo, Maria and Joaquin together. Manolo's relationships with his dad Carlos (Hector Elizondo) and his departed mom Carmen (Ana de la Reguera) are coloured in with surprising depth as well. It's also wonderful to see a love triangle centred around a girl who knows her own mind - and rest assured that Maria speaks it often enough to make a real impact.The Book Of Life also doubles as a very welcome riot of imagination and tradition. Every frame of the film is beautifully and thoughtfully designed, down to the fact that Manolo seems to have been intricately crafted out of wood. Moreover, instead of shying away from its Mexican roots to increase its global marketability, the film firmly embraces them. This gives Gutierrez room to craft some delicately dark moments in a graveyard or two, reminding everyone that those who have died can still live as long as they're remembered by the ones who loved them. And yet, the film never descends into darkness, instead tapping into the giddying energy of a fiesta - most memorably in a journey through the Land of the Remembered - complete with heady bursts of colour and music.There's no denying that Gutierrez's film can occasionally be too much to handle. It's loud and almost cheerfully silly, tossing pop songs and Mexican folklore into a mix that sometimes doesn't work. But, at its best, The Book Of Life is like a rambunctious puppy: messy, loud and insistent, but radiating so much life and charm that it becomes quite impossible to resist."
11,The Book of Life,4,24 October 2014,A Frustrating Sit,"The Book of Life is so close to greatness, yet so far. I liked the characters. I liked the scope. I loved the animation, one of the few times 3D animation is as stylized as 2D. A complete rewrite and an additional 20 minutes could have made Book of Life an 8 or higher. Sadly, Book of Life has one of the most atrocious scripts I've seen in the theater. Its a dumb, annoying, unfunny movie, built for the modern kid over the family.I can't go into every grievance I have. I was fuming in the theater, and just blazing in the car. The framing device is pointless. The narration is completely unnecessary. They can't decide to criticize or embrace their love triangle. There's tons of stupid slapstick characters. Serious moments are ruined by jokes. Characters speak in modern lingo. Plot points are brought up and resolved with a hand-wave.Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! I feel like the writers should have taken a 101 college class, if only to learn ""Show, don't tell!"" Its humor lacks creativity or timing, and only hampers a relatively serious story. Book of Life is an inept train-wreck, saved by its artistry (I'm surprised it only cost $50 million). Personally, I'd only recommend it for the die-hard fans of animation, or parents with nothing else to do. Its the most disappointing movie I've seen this year."
12,The Book of Life,4,22 December 2014,Amazingly uneven.,"When ""The Book of Life"" began, I was really enthralled by its creative art style. After all, there are so many CGI films out these days that it's great to see one that looks so different and bold. There also were a few scenes that simply blew me away with the grand look--such as when the film went to the Kingdom of the Dead. In this sense, ""The Book of Life"" is clearly a gorgeous film. I also really appreciated the character designs. Imagine if you look traditional Mexican articulated wooden sculptures for Day of the Dead and you make many of the characters look like living versions of these statues--that is what most of the characters looked like in this movie. I loved this and felt that the animators and artists were by far the biggest stars of the film and I could see this film being nominated for technical awards because of this.Unfortunately, apart from the artistry, there wasn't a lot I loved about the film. The story had great parts--but too often the characters were poorly developed, clichéd and one-dimensional. Also the soundtrack was simply bizarre. There were just too many singing interludes and the range of genres was so broad that it just left me baffled. Imagine...the film uses some traditional Latin tunes but also had some songs written by Paul Williams (""The Apology Song"" was actually quite good I must say), ""Do You Think I'm Sexy"" (by Rod Stewart) and a very adult tune originally by Radiohead (the song ""Creep"",-which includes a line about someone being so 'f---ing special', although fortunately the song ended just before this line)! Who chose these tunes?! Overall, the film looked great but otherwise left me very, very flat. Not terrible but with such artistry it's hard to imagine the rest of it being so sub-par. It's sad, as I really did want to see a Mexican storyline and it was nice to see so many Latin-American voice actors (though Channing Tatum and Ice Cube seemed like odd additions to the rest of the cast). Flawed but interesting."
13,The Book of Life,4,1 December 2014,Booorrrriinnngg,"I'm Del Toro's biggest fan...BUT, this was nothing even close to what we are used to see of this director/producer...beautiful graphics...but that's it. I went with my two daughters and we found it extremely boring. It's one cliché after another, and, is really predictable what your are going to see. We left before the end of the movie...I suppose that for other countries maybe its refreshing to see new mortuary customs, but for us, Latin Americans, its nothing new.I had big expectations based from previous movies like ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" or ""Pacific Rim"". This movie did not met my expectations."
14,The Book of Life,6,22 October 2014,Book of Life is filled with Mexican Beauty. I wish it had a better Mexican Story,"Much of what people hear about Mexico is negative. When the country appears on CNN, they tell of a drug lord who is trying to make his way into the States with his product or that the children need donations of water and clothes. They treat this as if Mexico was a third world country, even though I see nothing more then a country that's more disorganized than dangerous. What most people seem to forget is that Mexico is land where it's history and culture is filled with riches of artistic merit that has become more present in our American culture. The Mexican day of the dead is one of their most important holidays as its traditions encourage celebration rather then fear. The scary masks and skeletons wish that we need to remember the people that we've lost as our memories of them are their fuel to live in the afterlife. Treating death as a party sounds like an offensive idea, but I find it rather southing, not to mention feeling a bit cultured as I've been taught something unique about the customs from the south of the border. Producer Guillermo Del Toro bring us the day of the dead in the animated format of The Book of Life.In the real world, a bunch of delinquent children are brought to a museum where a tour guide Mary Beth (played by Christina Applegate) takes them to a special room where the title book of life is and proceeds to tell a story from it, using wooden figures that come to life within the tale.In the Mexican town of San Angel, two gods, La Muerte (played by Kate del Castillo) the ruler of the land of the remembered and Xibala (played by Ron Perlman) the ruler of the land of the forgotten, wager upon two boys that have fallen in love with the same girl is set to determine whether good triumphs evil. Over the years, Manolo (played by Diego Luna) has been training to be a bullfighter even though he would rather be a musician. His friend Joaquín (played by Channing Tatum) has become a courageous solider that the town loves (though he's cheated by wearing a magical medal that protects him from death). They both have their hearts set on the adult María (played by Zoe Saldana). Sensing that Manolo has a better chance of winning, Xibala tricks him into getting bitten by a two headed snake. This sends Manolo into the land of the remembered where his ancestors help him find a way back into living. The Book of Life has an amazing design. I went to a 3D screening of this and was blown away by how beautiful and imaginative this was. It was a great idea to have wooden figurines as the focus as the regular human designs are the only thing bland and fake looking. Human skin seems to be the most difficult thing to computer animate and Book of Life was smart to take another route. The art is to die for, but how's the content?Substance was clearly not the focus as I got a bland love story along with a bland hero, bland charmer, bland girl, bland gods, and even bland animal sidekicks. You would think that having a passionate creative mind like Guillermo Del Toro would warrant something with a lot more texture. Oh well, for what it is, the winner here is the animation and look. The day of the dead stuff is even educational and I wouldn't object a child watching this. I'll give this six dead mariachi groups out of ten. It'll probably make for a nice time killer and I might pick up an art of The Book of Life book for my coffee table."
15,The Book of Life,6,27 May 2015,"Feast for the Eyes, not the mind","What we have here is a imaginative, visually stunning feast for the eyes overlayed upon a rather boiler-plate story. The Mexican imagery is lush, detailed, colorful and while that is enough for a time, it does fatigue when there is nothing compelling behind it. The music is, strangely and sadly, American pop tunes spiced up with a little accordian or guitar to remind us this is supposed to be Mexico. Why not have the characters sing some really beautiful Mexican ballads? As for that story, it's a weak re-hash of pretty much every animated and super-hero film you've seen in the last few years. Good guy must triumph against all odds and achieve the goal, in this case, winning the girl, and is thwarted along the way by the super-evil character. You could actually watch this with the sound off and just enjoy the visuals and still understand the story."
16,The Book of Life,4,12 January 2015,Propaganda movie,"The idea of the movie is OK, but the implementation of it is horrible, so basically if you're interested in indoctrinating your kids with the idea/message that ""all men are the same"" and that all women that aren't educated act ""stupid"" and that women that have education must act like boys and consider all men as inferior(a farm animal being superior)/not needed, and presents a confusion of pseudo-religious and social concepts with the intent of preparing your kid for the next level of leftist indoctrination when he grows up, then, this is the movie for you. I gave the 4/10 because it's not boring but not good either(even with politics aside)."
17,The Book of Life,4,2 May 2015,Expected Better! 4/10,"Review: This is an average movie about 2 best friends who both love the same girl and fight to prove who is worthy of her love. One is a famous bull fighter, who really wants to be a musician and the other is a highly decorated soldier who protects his village from evil. There are some other elements to the storyline which makes it quite interesting but the animation looked weird, especially the characters with the weird noses which looked more like snouts. Personally, I think that the storyline is a bit too confusing for kids and the songs weren't that great. I did enjoy all of the scenes with Ice Cube but most of the movie was corny and it seemed a bit messy. On the plus side, the kids will like the vibrant colours and the love story between Manolo and Maria but I was expecting more from this film. Average!Round-Up: Although I didn't think that this movie was that great, it did make a healthy profit at the box office, mainly because it's a fun day out for the family. I couldn't really tell who was Chaning Tatum but Ice Cube and Ron Perlman was blatantly obvious. The animation looked a bit blocky but the attention to detail was quite impressive. As the film had a Mexican flavour, I think the director missed the chance to have a great soundtrack. Anyway, it's not an all time classic like Frozen, which did rely a lot on the soundtrack, but it's harmless fun for the whole family. Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $97.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation movies about 2 best friends who are fighting against each other to impress there true love. 4/10"
18,The Book of Life,10,10 October 2014,"Funny, Cute and Festive - Perfect Halloween Film for Younger Kids","On October 17th Twentieth Century Fox brings a new Halloween movie to the big screen. This is sure to become a must-see for everyone at Halloween time!This animated feature is set in South America. It is colorful and festive and I enjoyed learning about all the different cultural beliefs of Latin America. On the day that we celebrate Halloween, they celebrate Mexican Day of the Dead. This movie is funny, cute and the story keeps your attention from beginning to the end.Many of the movies we see today seem like the same story or theme told in different ways. This movie is truly an original. There are many hints of movies you have seen before but overall, it is truly a different movie. The animators' attention to detail is mind boggling. The characters are made of wood but, after the first five minutes you see them as real people. The intercut details are astonishing. The unique personalities and different characters will keep you entertained. Animals, people, spirits - this movie has it all. Maria is my favorite because she is a little girl with cute pig tails. She is fun, bubbly, tough and adventurous. Her independence gets her in trouble but at the same time it is her greatest asset. We watch her grow from a child to a young lady. She keeps the same spirit and kind heart. She must choose who to marry between her two best friends. Zoe Saldana voices the character and really brings her to life. The candlestick maker, voiced by Ice Cube, is laugh-out-loud funny. Even though he is not in the movie for very much time, you will leave with a smile on your face just thinking about him. Gabriel Iglesias, Cheech Marin, Hector Elizondo are three amigos who try to help one of our heroes win Maria's hand in marriage. The singing group is hilarious. The song choices are great and made me giggle. There are many messages in this film. The two heroes follow in their father footsteps. We see how it is important to remember your ancestors but also know that you are your own person and should follow your own path. Although it has been a long-standing tradition, bull fighting is beginning to be thought of as wrong. The bulls should be allowed to live. We see how it takes a whole village of people to protect and look out for each other and how everyone needs to be on the same team helping everyone else. I recommend this movie ages 7 to 18. It is about Halloween and the Mexican Day of the Dead. Although it is entertaining it is still about death and there is violence. I give this movie 5 out of 5 twinkling stars. Reviewed by KIDS FIRST!

19,The Book of Life,9,15 October 2014,"Beautifully animated, lovingly hilarious and super adorable!","The Book of Life (2014) is beautifully animated, lovingly hilarious and super adorable! Aside from being artistically enchanting, it is also everlasting as it filled with plenty of invaluable life lessons! Honestly, it isn't easy to use just one word to describe this film but if I have to, it would be EXTRAORDINARY!There is a lot of depth and efforts put into this film. Each of the characters are distinctive in their own and the story is certainly enchanting! From the Mexican cultural values and background elements to its stunning visuals and entertaining adventure; it's evident that this wouldn't be possible without the hard work, skills and wits of the creators of this film!Honestly, I am truly impressed with this film and this would be the my longest movie review so far! I may seem biased but I am not alright. This film really deserve all t-this... love?!SO... HERE'S FIVE REASONS WHY I THINK THE BOOK OF LIFE (2014) IS EXTRAORDINARY!1. The Book of Life (2014) have beautiful art or in their own words, unique visual style! I love how everything's so pretty, vivid and colorful. By everything, I really meant everything; all the characters designs, world designs and whatnot. The real world, the land of remembered and the land of forgotten are vastly different realms but they are all still equally and really beautiful!! Take in mind that this is the animation studio's second feature film and it's already this beautiful so how not to admire them? Sigh, if only death and afterlife is that beautiful! T_T...2. Great music and lyrics. Okay, I understand everyone has different tastes in music and I am certainly not an expert in music but the songs here in the movie are performed with nothing but full of genuine feelings! Some of the songs are funny, some are touching or heartbreaking and some are just romantic or adorable but how can these be not great when all those songs matches the mood of the scenes and enhances the impact of the storytelling?3. We can learn some Spanish words as well as how and when you should use it. It's fun to pick up new foreign words, you know! (You can read the list of words I've learned on my blog or moviepilot post)4. Full of invaluable life lessons that deals with love, life, death and dreams. I guess ultimately the main message of this animated feature is be yourself; do and fight for what what you love and what you hold dear! Don't ever change yourself because of others' expectation! And.. our loved ones will always be with us if we always remember and truly love them!5. Last but not least, you'll certainly have fun watching this endearing film! Although which two characters will get together in the end is kind of predictable, the unusual adventure overall isn't predictable at all! If I can give them an award, it would be ""The Best Animated Storytelling of the Year!"" ^___^You should watch this if you love animations when it's out on theatres; this latest Halloween animated feature that celebrates the Day of the Dead is certainly not your typical love and death story! My movie review ends here. As The Book of Life (2014) is truly unlike anything i have seen before, it easily becomes one of my all time favorite animated feature! You know, I have been waiting for this for months and thank God it did not disappoint!PS. I wish there's really such a book; I would die to get myself a copy!"
20,The Book of Life,8,18 October 2014,A visually stunning animated film with unique and captivating character designs and settings,"The Book of Life is a refreshing new animated tale about Mexican folk beliefs, especially the Day of the Dead (Día de Muertos), a day where families and friends gather to pray for and remember their loved ones who have died. Aside from its basic themes about love, family and friendship, The Book of Life features some mature, darker ones such as life and death, pursue your dreams, never forget those who have passed on and never stop looking forward to the future at the same time, always be yourself and never lose sight of who you are. The plot is done with enough wit, charm, humour and sincerity that makes it an enjoyable ride.The story is mainly about three childhood friends, Manolo, Joaquin and Maria who got caught in a wager going on between the Mexican lords of the underworld, La Muerte (ruler of The Land of the Remembered) and Xibalba (ruler of The Land of the Forgotten). These deities each pick a champion between these two boys and bet on who can win Maria's heart and marry her. So best friends become bitter love rivals for a woman's heart. Aside from that, Manolo is torn between following his heart to become a musician or satisfy his dad's expectation to continue the family's legacy.The film is beautiful, stylish and visually stunning. Despite its darker tone, the film doesn't feel terrifying at all. It shows us a world filled with wonder and spectacle, especially The Land of the Remembered, which is full of vibrant, lively colours despite the fact that it's actually the land of the undead. It provides us unique, captivating character designs and set pieces with close attention to detail about Mexican culture and traditions. The characters are strong, charming and lovable. The film did a fine job addressing the importance of remembering our loved ones who have died. The love triangle between Manolo, Maria and Joaquin is well developed as well.The songs chosen for the film were great, breathes life into the scenes and provide the necessary emotional impact to keep the audience engaged throughout the film. I do admit there are a few plot contrivances here and there, but remember, this is still a kids/family film, so just cut it some slack and give it a chance. Some of the voice actors did a good job imitating the Mexican accent to make it feel like an authentic Mexican animation. Overall, it's a charming, sweet romantic film with surprising depth and plenty of heart that's good enough for both kids and adults to enjoy at the same time. A recommended watch.Rating: 8/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/10/movie-review-book-of-life.html"
21,The Book of Life,8,22 October 2014,Excellent for art admirers and people looking for something different,"First off, as an illustrator and animator, the set and character designs were beyond stunning. I can tell the amount of research the team had done, and I appreciate every eyefull of it, it was so vibrant and beautiful.Past the amazing design choices and art direction, the story itself was very well told too. I especially admired that there wasn't a ""bad guy"", there were just people against the protagonist. It really gave personality to each person, seeing what they dreamed of and what they wanted out of life.One thing that especially makes me so excited about this movie is also that it isn't based on white western culture, honestly it gets so tiring seeing the same old Disney girl falls in love with boy thing. And its really nice to see something that is so different in its visual and setting choices, and also seeing them do it in a way that isn't offensive.A lot of the pop songs in the movie seemed very unnecessary and didn't fit the setting at all, I really wish they used original scores or even just music that fit the culture more, it would have flown that much more. On the same kind of topic, a few of the jokes were unneeded as well. An example is the running gag of the four ""pretty"" ladies, it could have been taken out, and close to nothing would have been lost. It feels like its just a trope that they felt had to be used. Or even after the incredibly touching scene where Monolo defeated the final bull, then the Candlemaker just burst out with joy, it switched the scene too quickly and it didn't give me time to really take in what had just happened.Overall, I adored the movie, even with its faults. Its one that I'll be anxiously awaiting the art book and DVD for, and maybe even some merch!"
22,The Book of Life,8,9 January 2015,Frida meets Corpse Bride,"Name: The Book of Life Year: 2014 Genre: Adventure Sub-Genre: Animation with comedic and romantic tones. Directed by: Jorge R. Gutierrez Starring: Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana, Channing Tatum Supporting Stars: Christina Applegate, Ice Cube, Ron Perlman, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo and (OMG) Plácido Domingo!I'll be honest, the animation for the movie really turned me off and I put the movie on a twenty-minute timer. Which means that if the movie doesn't impress me in twenty minutes I'm not going to bother with the rest of it. I typically only do that if the movie strikes me as awful in the first few minutes or so. Some movies never make it past that point. A good example would be Barnyard (2006). Yeah, male cows with udders completely shut the movie down for me regardless of the director's tongue and cheek attempt at humor.As I mentioned, this movie was in trouble when I saw the animation. Check out this guy's nose!So I became wary and put the movie on notice. Fortunately, it really picked up afterward and I found the movie quite enjoyable. I think what really saved this movie was it's soundtrack. The music in this movie is a mix between culturally appropriate and yet easily identifiable by a modern viewer with little experience in Mexican folklore and tradition. There were also some original songs which I also enjoyed. I settled into the movie and took in it's story; I wasn't disappointed. It begins with five school kids going to what they believe to be another boring field trip to the museum. Instead they are treated to an exclusive tour through a secret exhibit where a radical and mysteriously magical tour guide (narrated by Christina Applegate] shares a story about life, death, and the adventure of true love and friendship. Okay, maybe it sounds a little hokey as I've described - but then it gets better. The story unfolds to reveal two cosmic archetypes of Mexican folk-lore. The goddess who presides over the Land of the Remembered, an after-world of joy and celebration and the god who rules the Land of the Forgotten, a desolate and dismal place of dust and shadow. They make a bet, as they often do, over which one of two young suitors, Manolo and Joaquin, (who happen to be best friends) win the hand in marriage of Maria; the jewel of the village of San Angels. The stakes: the destinies and free will of the people in the Land of the Living.Interwoven in this storyline are the shadows of great family legacies the young men find themselves living in as well as the free thinking and spirited ideals of Maria, a worldly, modern, well- educated woman struggling with the burdens of tradition and old-fashioned expectations.If you enjoyed Frida (2002) and Corpse Bride (2005) then you'll really like this one as well. I gave it an 8 on IDMB for good storytelling, excellent music, and the ability to invoke emotion in me with it's ending.Oh, I almost forgot to mention. The movie was produced by Guillermo de Toro, one of my favorite directors.--------------- Re-posted from Fortitude42.Com"
23,The Book of Life,8,8 January 2015,Visually stunning,"Right after watching this movie i have already decided to watch this again (and again). The visuals are absolutely stunning and so creative.I will not say too much about the story, you can read that in other reviews, except that it is a collage of Mexican folklore wrapped in a love story.The animation is mind blowing, things that shouldn't work do work. For example the exaggerated physical features normally i don't like too much, but in this film they work.The world that the director created is just amazing, in every shot there is so much to see.For everyone that enjoys a good and fun story and loves animation you have to see this. I know i will be seeing it again"
24,The Book of Life,9,8 January 2015,a must see for young and old !,"this is my first review of any movie title here ! that should tell ya how exasperatingly surprised and awkwardly good i felt after watching this one !pleasantly surprised- mesmerizing colors, silly yet meaningful songs (rather short lasting though), excellent voices and an overwhelmingly likable plot- excellent in every sense of the word !there are those light moments- Ice Cube nails his moments ! n then there are those moments of true emotions- perfectly balanced !Jorge R. Gutierrez- u rocked this one man ! a must see for young and old !"
25,The Book of Life,9,7 January 2015,Loved it!,"Was a little skeptical to watch it at first, because I didn't see as much advertising as other new cartoons at the time. I mean come-on, when you watch a new cartoon with your kid you want to enjoy as much as them. I watched the trailer and it looked decent enough. So I went ahead and watched it with my 5 year old. We both really liked it (okay maybe I enjoyed it a little more then her..) I thought it was very colorful. Definitely made me laugh countless times. It also had some great tunes, which made the flick even more enjoyable. Also had some really great concepts and ""lessons"" ( I guess that's what I'll call them). It did have one somewhat ""scary"" part, which wasn't all the scary but it did frighten my daughter for a few seconds. If you have young kids that may be something to be aware of. All- in-all a very enjoyable movie that I probably will be watching again."
26,The Book of Life,8,27 October 2014,Unique story done pretty well,"Manolo is a kid from a bull fighting family who would rather play guitar and sing than kill bulls (but isn't a bad bull fighter when he must), Joaquin is another local boy who receives a medal that makes him invincible. They compete for the love of the beauty Maria, and their competition leads to wagering among the gods. Along the way their saga involves the evil Chakal, who menaces their town. This was good off the beaten track stuff, here's where it fares better than Disney: 1) there was very little formula to this, there was really little way to figure where this was going; 2) the running time was where it should be, unlike some padded Disney features; and 3) they minimized (but didn't eliminate) the standard goofy cartoon caricatures (like the fat guy who loves to eat). Here's what I didn't like as much: 1) the story didn't really really grab me for whatever reason, I'm not sure why; and 2) I didn't get Ice Cube's rendition of the Candlemaker in the least, it didn't fit at all and significantly detracted from the movie. I did like the way they wrapped things up, which is why it hit an eight on my ratings."
27,The Book of Life,,24 October 2014,Falls sadly short,"I really wanted to love this. The design and texturing of every character, scene and prop is absolutely gorgeous. In that aspect they really recreated Day of the Dead culture beautifully. The gags are sometimes funny, sometimes silly ... I can accept that in a movie made primarily of kids. The story is OK for the most part. Where it really fell short for me was the soundtrack. There would suddenly be a pop song that totally takes you out of this entire cultural world they put so much effort into creating, to the degree that it's laughable. Not even a Mexican pop song, but some blatant American or English pop that either came across cheesy or completely ridiculous. Whoever chose to put Elvis or Radiohead in this film totally ruined it for me. There is certainly more appropriate Mexican music to support the mood of the film. Why recreate the look of an entire cultural event only to throw in something musically that so completely doesn't fit in the context of the mood, story or film? I don't get it"
28,The Book of Life,7,21 February 2015,An incredibly beautiful movie that has pacing issues and a fairly weak plot,"The Book of Life is an interesting movie because it part incredibly generic and part insanely unique and original. Fortunately, the unique and original outshines the generic, but it can still be troublesome at times.The Book of Life is literally a love triangle movie. From the very beginning of the movie it clearly states: This a movie about two boys who love the same girl. The nice thing about this is that the movie doesn't hide its premise at all. It isn't a movie that simply has a love triangle in it, it is a movie about the love triangle.That being said, the movie's love triangle isn't gosh awful, but it is kind of annoying. Either the character's are overly obsessive or the girl is kind of a jerk for taking advantage of the obvious love triangle. However, the character's themselves aren't bad and are pretty good.The plot to The Book of Life isn't a bad plot, and it has some very unique elements but it isn't a very deep or complex plot. The thing about this movie is that it doesn't need to be complex. Its main purpose is to be highly entertaining, cute, and very very beautiful. And at that... it succeeds. The wonderful thing about this movie is that it proved something that all animation fans have been waiting for for years: A CGI movie can look as beautiful as its concept art and the transition from sketches to 3D can look flawless. A lot of 3D animated films will lose elements of their original art and vision. They will have the general feel, but they usually lose something. But when you look at this movie's concept art and the final product you can tell that nothing was lost (if anything, the movie looks more beautiful and energetic than the concept art).This movie is simply stunning to look at and everything in it has a lot of energy. What is even more interesting about this movie's animation is that is proves that you don't need insane amounts of detail to make a beautiful 3D movie. A lot of 3D animated movies make beauty through complexity (and The Book of Life is complex) but it knows that the control of color, lighting, and atmosphere is what really makes something beautiful.If there is one other major issue with the movie it is that its pacing is really really fast and sometimes emotional scenes pop out of nowhere or scenes that are supposed to be important only last a few seconds. It feels like some of the less important scenes should've been shorter and the more important scenes should've been longer.Overall, The Book of Life was an enjoyable movie that had amazing animation. A lot of its design choices and characters are insanely creative and just stunning. Unfortunately, it suffers from some pacing issues and some clichés, but it is entertaining, nonetheless."
29,The Book of Life,6,6 February 2015,I think I've Read This Book Before...,"Well, what can you say? It's a VERY modern animation. Computer generated (Of course), has a downtrodden hero who is trained to kill bulls but truly wants to be a musician, whereas his best friend, the egotistical soldier, is loved by everyone for saving the town repeatedly but is a bit of a jerk. There's a girl the two of them are fighting for... But like with most recent animated efforts this is NO 'damsel in distress'... She can swordfight, do Kung Fu and she has OPINIONS OF HER OWN.The movie is rather too determined to show us how 'enlightened' she is, and she comes across as being a composite of politically correct ideals of how a studio thinks a woman should be depicted, rather than an interesting character in her own right. The two men have an intriguing love/hate relationship during their rivalry for the hand of the lady, but as individuals there is also something VERY familiar about their personalities.They do feel like amalgamations of traits stolen from other cartoon protagonists in the past... Aladdin, Puss In Boots, Hercules... The list goes on. Maybe I've seen too many of this genre to ever be surprised again. Or, perhaps the movie borrows too liberally from it's sources to the extent that the feeling of deja vu is paramount. Perhaps a bit of both...There is also a HUGE supporting cast of characters... Some comical, others threatening, a few plonked in for no good reason at all. My favourite were the two gods, who you can tell are passionately in love with each other... Even through all their feuding. Some dramatic moments are effective, others made me want to gag. Let's call it a 50/50 split.The animation is brilliant, especially the scenes set in The Land Of The Remembered which is an oasis of colour and activity. The design of everyone looks pretty odd at first glance, but you soon get used to it and the makers should be praised for their uniqueness and variety. Overall, not the strongest CGI film I've seen of late, as I had major misgivings with the hackneyed plot, derivative characters and lack of humour. But for all that, it IS fun and just about worth the 90 minute investment. Overall: 6/10"
30,The Book of Life,8,9 January 2015,Fun and all kinds of colorful!,"It's pretty awesome how animated movies aren't just colorful glob to amuse the kids while you quickly gulp down a bottle of booze in the kitchen or try to have a moment's peace and think about why exactly you had kids. Nope, they are now colorful glob that we can all enjoyno matter what our age. And since we are living in a golden era of animated films, it's nice seeing how varied they are becoming.My expectations weren't really spiking high or low for ""The Book of Life"" so I was pretty much blown away with how much I enjoyed it. The animation is great (although, I admit, it had a rocky start), the story is bursting with great music, heart, and humor, and the voice acting is terrific. Finally, the most obvious thing about it all is the fact the film is a visual feast filled with designs that are rich in detail and extremely colorful.In the end, while I had no real expectations for it, ""The Book of Life"" proved to be an amazing animated film that was great to watch and extremely entertaining."
31,The Book of Life,9,18 January 2015,The Bull Does it Again!,"And I will wager you will love it.Like all love stories, good and bad, it is predictable. And like all love stories good, it makes you laugh, chuckle, and tear-up just enough to leave you with a warm feeling at the end of it all.The voice acting is good and the direction is crisp and the dear Del Toro was awesomely impressive and proves that he still has that pizazz that makes his movies so anticipated.A lovely animated parable that hits all the sweet spots with a couple of really soul stirring songs (one is during the end credits).And, here is one more line for IMDb to accept the review :)"
32,The Book of Life,8,8 January 2015,"Beautiful, well-crafted animation","The movie starts with a cliché setting: a bunch of delinquent kids come to a museum and get to hear a story from a mysterious guide. From there, it goes on quite slowly and unimpressively with all the background mythology being introduced through narrating, and the introduction of the three pretty typical main characters. But after these first 10 minutes or so, the magical beautiful world of the movie truly starts to unfold. Visually, this movie is one of the best recently, not just because of the technology, but because it was able to build a whole world of its own. While Dreamworks and Disney lately have kept making movies after movies with basically the same safe and boring art style, the makers of this one have set out to create a style of their own. It's so bold, so gorgeous, and more importantly, it fits the story perfectly. You can feel the great attention to details given into every character and every frame, making them all so lively, unique, and beautiful. Another great thing is the characterization. Most supporting characters are memorable and interesting despite having little screen time. This is due in no small part to the unique designs and good voice works. It actually make me want to see a whole series of shorts just to know more about each of them. It reminds me of those great classic video games from LucasArts like the Monkey Island series or Grim Fandango, which were also famous for great characters.The story overall is your typical love triangle, but the way it fits into the theme, and brings us through different settings with all the great characters make the experience very worthwhile. The humor is silly but quite on point, in terms of both timing and delivering. The songs are also good, though I'm a bit disappointed that they used some covers instead of all-original soundtracks. The only thing I really hate is the parts with those kids at the museum, because it's so distracting and it feels like they're trying to dumb down the movie by having the guide explain things to the viewers.Overall, this is a very entertaining movie with a good message and beautiful animation. I recommend watching this in 3D and with a big screen if you can to really see all of its greatness."
33,The Book of Life,9,2 January 2015,One of the most interesting and visually pleasing films I've seen,"""The Book of Life"" is a perfectly-executed explosion of color and emotion. It tells a romantic and interesting tale of a man fighting for the woman that he loves, even in death. The story is original and creative and is wonderfully-saturated. The art style is colorful, expansive, and gives an impressive, yet relaxing feel. The visual style also blends well with the astounding soundtrack. I never would have expected today's music (which I normally hate) to sound so good with just a little Hispanic-influence. I went and saw this movie after a really bad day and was taken away by the sheer beauty of the soundtrack, visual quality, and heart-bending story. Plus the inspirational messages that it put forth gave it more to build on. The messages that the movie gave throughout its course ranged from ""Write your own story."" to ""Never give up on the things that you love and believe in."" All of these being very inspirational when put forth to the viewer. I continuously thought about these messages, even after the movies screening, and the way they were put forth; and it simply made me want to watch the movie again. The only problem that this movie had was that at times it felt like things were passing quickly, but it makes up for this by the end of the film where it feels like you have seen a two-hour long film when it's only 95 minutes in length. The Book of Life is the movie that we needed it to be. With fantastic performances from people such as Ron Perlman, Ice Cube, and Zoe Saldana; The Book of Life is a film that I could recommend to anyone of any age. Whether to watch it alone as I did, or with a family or significant other. Final Rating: 9.5/10"
34,The Book of Life,8,28 December 2014,A Beautiful love Story and shows so Well the Mexican Culture,"A long time since I've seen such a good animation as this. 95 minutes of my life well spent, so do not have maximum score because of some songs would have to be in Spanish, should have more actors with Spanish accent. that would give more accuracy to the story, it was a little too American .especially the man of the candles, and the last song .beside all this it was a good film to see .no regretI saw with friends and their children we all loved, especially the adults it was very funny, I recommend to see in family at Christmas, I think Mexicans are properly glad to see their culture being shown in this way, I can not wait to get the blu-ray"
35,The Book of Life,8,28 December 2014,"Feel good movie, makes an ordinary story special","As evident from the posters, the movie is set in a Mexican background. Revolving around love and most importantly friendship, the movie is a fun ride. You can also find a slight touch of MJ's The Girl Is Mine if you watch attentively. The animation is different from the other anime movies but it is still enjoyable. The story of 3 good friends and how they faced the hardships of decision-making that the world imposes on them. Watch through the exciting twists and turns, though predictable to some extent, the beautiful ending to a beautiful story. As any other anime movie it carries moral lessons with it undoubtedly. But not just one, but many lessons about love, friendship, heroism, forgiveness and bravery are touched directly in subplots. If you have enjoyed The Lego Movie , you will definitely enjoy this ride. Love life!"
36,The Book of Life,8,5 November 2014,Very Enjoyable,"My 9 year old and I loved this movie. Full of richly colorful animation with funny moments. The characters were easy to like and not too over the top. The movie really kept our attention from beginning to end. Only the idea of the main female character being fought over for marriage turned me off. They made a lot of efforts to make her seem like a strong female, but in the end they never made her choice seem like her own. The Mexican setting and theme were beautiful. The theme of being true to yourself, even under pressure, but being flexible enough to consider others was well done. I thought that the theme would be too dark, but it was surprisingly upbeat. I would definitely recommend this film for children between 7 and 12."
37,The Book of Life,8,3 November 2014,The Book of Life was a wonderful animated rendition of a Mexican tale,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both seemed to enjoy this animated take on a Mexican tale of two men in love with the same woman and the way they deal with their love for her as well as a couple of spirits having a bet concerning them. Oh, and there's a modern wrap-around with a museum guide telling some unruly kids this tale I just mentioned. Like many modern animated movies, this one has some celebrity voices I recognized like Christina Applegate as the museum guide. There was also some wonderfully unique renditions of some recent pop songs in there. Such a wonderful mix of colors and culture was this. So on that note, I highly recommend The Book of Life."
38,The Book of Life,8,1 November 2014,Does a great job transporting you to other worlds,"One of the best animated films of 2014 along with The Lego Movie and How to Train Your Dragon 2 and much better than the trailer suggested it to be. It's not perfect but it is very good not only as an animated film but as a film in general and it is great for children and adults alike. The best thing about The Book of Life is the animation, which is never less than outstanding and even spellbinding at its best, consisting of vivid warm colours, smooth imaginatively done background art and beautifully drawn character designs that look real. The brilliantly colourful and psychedelic imagery of Land of the Forgotten and the character designs of the two supernatural lead characters are particularly well done, the whole film is a stunner to look at and has so much depth and rich detail. The music is good and fits well, the score is robust and authentically orchestrated and the songs are a lot of fun- in the cinema you have difficulty resisting the temptation to sing along and tap your feet-, are catchy and of many moods. If there was any complaint about the soundtrack, it's that I wish there was more of a Mexican vibe to it. The script was sharp and funny, even managing to liven the darker elements a little without jarring or being over-reliant on postmodern gags, it has a good flow and is always easy to understand. The story isn't perfect but is a winner overall. does it have clichés? Of course it does. Does it handle them well? Yes. It does have its overstuffed and contrived spots but it's warm-hearted, entertaining from the get go right up to the last second and you always feel like you're being immersed in all these different worlds in the film, which aside from the animation was what was the most remarkable thing about The Book of Life. There's also some good, relevant messaging that makes its point but in a subtle way rather than preachy. The characters are engaging and most of the voice acting is great, especially from Christina Applegate, Zoe Saldana(both playing with endearing sass and spunk), Kate del Castillo and Ron Perlman. The only exceptions for me were Channing Tatum whose line delivery was awkward at times and Ice Cube who felt and sounded out of place, sounding like he was playing himself rather than the character he was voicing. All in all, hugely entertaining and visually wondrous, a very good film animated and otherwise and definitely recommended. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
39,The Book of Life,8,31 October 2014,Frenetic and eye-catching,"Kids on a museum field trip are introduced to a Mexican folklore tale: two demigods feuding about who governs the afterlife bet on which of two potential suitors a girl will choose, all of which is bound up with treachery, bandit attacks on the town, trips to the underworld, and the ghosts of old family members.This CGI animation is hugely imaginative and very enjoyable (by both adults and kids, it would appear, from the audience I saw it with). It is dazzling, kinetic and frenetic - sometimes a bit too frenetic - and featured highly original character design (the characters in the main plot are all wooden puppets). The voice work is excellent, but this film stands out because of the overall design.The 3D is quite good. The framing story is unnecessary, but moderately effective."
40,The Book of Life,,29 October 2014,A lot of heart,"I really liked this! I thought the animation lend itself amazingly to the story being told, and there's a truly tremendous amount of heart in this picture. It seems like it was really made by someone very passionate about it, and as a result, it's so easy to like. Of course, also because it's very quite good. Maybe I do wish it had gone further with its storyline, as it is, it does seem like it caters too much for kids and this being told for older kids might've really made it even more special. As it is though, super enjoyable, some great characters, a lot of fun. This is highly recommended for the whole family, certainly at least original."
41,The Book of Life,8,26 October 2014,Great acting fun story,"Ice Cube always brings his A game to acting, and does really well in this movie as well.The general level of voice acting in this movie was a 9.5/10The story was a fun ride but nothing really exceptional or surprising. I saw most of the plot twists a mile away , but that isn't uncommon for movies today.I give it an overall 8/10(Ps to the writer if you see this while ego surfing. Many of us have both little boys and little girls. While it's great to see strong females in animated movies, having a movie where the male isn't a blundering idiot would be nice as well.)"
42,The Book of Life,8,1 November 2017,Write Your Own Story,"It's not often when you get a movie made in America that celebrates a foreign holiday as Did De Los Muertos, yet here comes a passion project from Jorge R. Gutierrez called The Book of Life, a film that is more of a visual film compared to it's basic story, but is nonetheless a great love letter to Mexican culture and to those who want to choose their own destiny.Right off the bat, the animation never holds back in it's creativity, from the highly vibrant colors, to Gutierrez's joyful cartoony character designs, to the Mexicana backgrounds, and some of the finest effects animation I've ever seen in computer animation to date. What really makes the characters stand out is how they are made as puppets to recreate the sense that it is a story told through fantasy. But the true highlight of the visuals is the Land of the Remembered, and without giving away anything, it knocks the cultural and artistic aspect of the movie out of the ball park, though I wish we spent a little longer there....buttersauce.Admittedly, the story is kinda generic in concept, complete with several clichés you would find in modern day animated films, but the main characters are charming and likable in their own way so it makes the experience a delight. Even the supporting cast all have their own quirks and charming personalities that work well to present them as lovable and memorable, although the villain was kinda forgettable. And even at that, the execution is just beautiful, from the passionate love triangle, to the songs that elevate the main character, and even the message to do what you feel is right rather than what others say.Overall, while its story is kinda formulaic, The Book of Life redeems itself tremendously with stunning animation, charming characters, such sweet romance, and such passion and respect for Mexican culture. Jorge Gutierrez has not really made another film as of now, but with a directorial debut this good, I cannot wait to see what else he has under his belt. Gracias Senior Gutierrez, and I look forward to that ""Citizen Kane of wresting movies"" you've got planned for the future."
43,The Book of Life,8,26 February 2016,Fantastic animated love story.,"Produced by Guillermo del Toro and directed by Jorge R. Gutierrez, THE BOOK OF LIFE is a flashy animated tale that blends a Romeo-and-Juliet style story, but actually a romance triangle using Mexican customs surrounding the Day of the Dead as a backdrop. The color is splashy and the story line is simple and serves as a charming homage to Mexican culture.The story involves three childhood friends; Manolo(Diego Luna), Maria(Zoe Saldana) and Joaquin(Channing Tatum); whose romantic twisted triangle becomes the subject of a wager between two Mexican deities...La Muerte(Kate del Castillo), the overseer of the Land of the Remembered and Xibalba(Ron Perlman), the lord of the Land of the Forgotten. Manolo comes from a heritage of bullfighters and is disappointing his father by wanting to be a singer, and declines to ever slay a bull in the ring. Joaquin is a pompous protector of the town trying to live in the shadow of his father, a fallen military hero. Maria is a beautiful young woman that desires a husband, but is sent off to a convent for grooming.The Book of Life is narrated by a lovely tour guide(Christina Applegate)as she relates the story to a bus load of students visiting a museum. The color is visually stunning and the characters are actually handcrafted wooden-like. There is a nice mix of peppy and romantic music holding the action together. The better of the songs are sung by the Manolo character voiced by Luna: ""The Creep"", ""I Love You Too Much"", ""The Apology Song"" and the Elvis classic, ""I Can't Help Falling In Love"".Other voices in this family feature: Cheech Marin, Ice Cube, Hector Elizonda, Danny Trejo, Placido Domingo, Eugenio Derbez and Dan Navarro."
44,The Book of Life,7,31 January 2016,So Much Potential that was Almost Completely Explored,"I went into the Book of Life with very little expectations. I didn't even know what it was about, I was just curious. Unfortunately I have very mixed feelings about it. The plot is great. It's a romance where a woman must choose between two very different men, meanwhile two gods have placed bets on who will marry the woman. It's a twist on the romantic genre that I really appreciated, and it satisfied for the most part (although we've seen the whole 'woman must choose partner from two men' scenario before, but it's not something we can really complain about, so long as it's presented well). The first hour of the movie is absolutely stunning. The plot is done so perfectly that I couldn't wait to see the outcome. But during the last half-hour it declined into a very, very average movie. I saw great potential in how the story would continue, but sadly it was unable to do so. It suddenly indulged itself in some horrible clichés that were unbelievably ill-suited to the previous hour. The characters are quite great too. While some of them are cliché, they're presented in such a way that really doesn't emphasize that fact. But once again, in the last 30 minutes some of them slacked off a little, which was a real downer. Now, since I've gotten the main stuff out of the way, let me elaborate on the last 30 minutes. By that time the awe of the visual style had worn off, so it was suddenly less impressive. Not only that, but the movie suddenly became much more action orientated. Now I think that the action could have been used very effectively, but it wasn't taken seriously enough (I'll come back to this later). Now I know that the whole movie really wasn't taken very seriously, but they were little jokes that were still amusing and although not laugh out loud funny, still fit the movie. It managed to maintain a relatively serious tone throughout the movie, and by the hour mark it looked to be taking a much darker turn that I knew would be for the better. Unfortunately, it didn't take that darker turn, and instead became way more light- hearted and 'fun', only it didn't suit the rest of the movie so it really wasn't that fun. I saw serious potential in how the rest of the story would play out, but instead it went for some less dark, less serious, and more predictable path. Towards the end, when the climax happened it was very unoriginal and boring to watch because I'd seen it all before in other kid's movies, where even then I hadn't been impressed (as a kid). Still, the last 30 minutes weren't awful...or so I thought. To avoid spoilers I'll just say that something so stupid, so unoriginal, and so ill-suited happened that it really hurt to watch. And then something even worse happened, and suddenly The Book of Life had gone from one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, and probably the best romance I've ever seen, to just a good movie. Normally I might just give this movie a 6/10 and be on with it, but with the absolute awe I was in at the beginning of the movie, I had to pay this movie some credit. While the first hour was a solid 9.5/10 and the last half hour was a 4.5-5/10, I decided to do a bit of rough math and settled upon a 7.5/10, because the majority of it was fantastic, but 1/3 of the movie was garbage. Weighed in with the bitter disappointment of the ending I'd say that that's a pretty accurate rating for it.Overall The Book of Life was impressive to say the least. Never have I ever seen a movie go from phenomenal to absolute trash so abruptly. It didn't gradually become awful, it was just suddenly awful, and then it just kept getting worse. I understand that its a kid's movie but jeez, you could have made it dark and still child- friendly. Not all animated movies have to be child-friendly either. Nevertheless, the movie was, for the first 2/3, fantastic. The visuals were flawless, the plot was driven fantastically well, the characters were cliché but still great. The last 1/3 was blatantly cliché, predictable, disappointing, lacking in character, lacking in cleverness, lacking in tone, and lacking in originality. It was a complete disappointment. In the end I'd recommend this movie, but only for the visuals and first hour. After that you might as well finish it, but don't be surprised if you find yourself scratching your head and wondering what the heck went wrong in the writer's mind."
45,The Book of Life,3,17 September 2015,Please don't waste your time,"The movie tells the story of a group of Mexican clichés where the only jobs in Mexico are bullfighter, bandit, mariachi, general, useless beautiful woman or useless peasant. Much of the plot involves people choosing between which Mexican cliché they will be. Also every talks English with terrible Mexican accents. In the end it represents Mexican people as other, both in their life and in the way that they look. Worse yet, the story is incredibly clichéd and boring. Destiny, choose, following in your fathers footsteps or make your own choice, blah, blah, blah.The whole banal plot line is dependent on racial stereotypes of Mexicans. This makes the story both predictable and uninteresting."
46,The Book of Life,7,5 February 2015,Not surprised that Guillermo del Toro was behind the film's production.,"'THE BOOK OF LIFE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed computer-animated movie, dealing with Mexican myths and folklore, about a young man who rebels against his family, in order to win over the woman he loves. It was directed by animator Jorge Gutierrez, written by Gutierrez and Douglas Langdale and produced by Guillermo del Toro. It stars the voice talents of Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana, Channing Tatum, Ron Perlman, Kate del Castillo, Christina Applegate, Ice Cube, Hector Elizondo and Danny Trejo. In addition to receiving mostly rave reviews from critics, it was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. I found it to be surprisingly well made and pretty entertaining (for a kids' flick).The film begins with a museum chaperone, named Mary Beth (Applegate), taking some kids on a tour. She begins telling them stories from the 'Book of Life' and focuses on one tale in particular, dealing with a wager made between two spirits; La Muerte (del Castillo), the ruler of the Land of the Remembered, and Xibalba (Perlman), the ruler of the Land of the Forgotten. They bet on which of two young boys, Manolo (Luna) or Joaquin (Tatum), will grow up to win the heart of the girl they both love, named Maria (Saldana). The film centers around Manolo's journey (the most), as he fights his way through three different worlds, to win over Maria's affection and save her.The film looks beautiful and the story and characters are a lot of fun. The music is perfectly fitting and the voice actors are perfectly cast as well. I really like that it's a movie about Mexican myths and legends, for a change. Gutierrez seems like a great animator, and director, and I'm not surprised that del Toro was behind the film's production as well. I'm not a big fan of kids' cartoon movies, like this (usually), but this one is pretty well made; one of the better ones this year.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/D17O2xOoOCw"
47,The Book of Life,7,26 January 2015,Not too shabby!,"There's something about this film that I can't seem to wrap my finger around. It's not your typical animation movie, then again it's not that different either.This movie revolves around three friends: two young boys and a girl. Maybe it's a bit cliché; two boys falling in love with their third best friend, a girl.Both boys have different talents, one's a great guitarist (Manolo), a composer of romantic songs, and the other, a macho-save-the-world hero type (Joaquin).But an unfortunate day befalls the three; Maria is sent to a convent school in Europe.As life goes on, these three grow up to be young adults. Manolo is forced to become, as part of his family tradition, a bull-fighter, and while he certainly has the talent, can't bring himself to kill a bull. Joaquin on the other hand, goes on to become the town's saviour and hero, following in his father's footsteps.They both await the day that Maria returns. But who will win her eternal love? So, you get the basic idea. The story's not too shabby, but isn't a new concept.One thing I certainly enjoyed in the film was the humour. But that's not all the film has to offer; a moderate story and humour, no there's more.The story teaches that although a person may possess great potential, he may not expose of it freely due to his fear of bringing shame to his family lineage and his fear of being an outcast.One other thing I admired about the two friends Manolo and Joanquin was that they never lost sight of their own friendship, even whilst fighting for the woman of their dreams. In the end, they were both ready to give their life for the other, knowing fully well that the other friend might eventually get their dream girl.So then, this movie has a lot of potential. It might not be the greatest animation of 2014, but it's definitely worth watching."
48,The Book of Life,10,2 November 2014,The best animation movie,"it is one of best movies i have never seen, with all The effects and great story, The best thing in The movie was La Muerte, i really think that i LOVE HER because she is beautiful and perfect in all aspects, some day i want to marry with her. I L O V E T H I S M O V I E And in other hand there is Manolo and Joaquín, they too love María and they want to marry with her, I prefer Manolo because i think that he is like me, but i like so much Joaquín because he is really funny, and María it is an awesome badass girl (but i prefer La Muerte), there is a little (Well big) and cute pig called Chuy, and it is very funny to see the things that Chuy's do, Well, my point is that i really looooveeee all of The movie the color, The characters, everything."
49,The Book of Life,9,25 October 2014,2014's Best Cartoon. Yet.,"If you've seen the trailer, the animation looks sketchy.Cheech Marin covering Biz Markie certainly doesn't help.You're not tantalized, and who can blame you?Neither was I.But guess which tops the list of Best Animated Features released in 2014?1. The Book of Life 2. Mr. Peabody & Sherman 3. The Lego Movie 4. How to Train Your Dragon 2 5. The BoxtrollsThat's right, folks. The BOL is pretty great.The animation isn't sketchy. Cheech's solo isn't hokey.The visuals are wondrous in fact. The animation is multi-layered, lending the fabric of cartoon reality a wood grain texture.Manolo's hometown is beautiful; like an Hispanic Mont Saint-Michel. The other world he passes through is gorgeously rendered as well.The humor is solid and consistent. The characters are compelling oddities.The narrative is heart-warming and educational.I worry because annually, the average moviegoer probably scrutinizes (at the most) two animated flicks via big screen.Frozen is such a hit from 2013, I'd imagine most viewers anticipate the November 7th release of Big Hero 6.Apparently everyone (and their mother) went to see The Lego Movie; and loved it so much a Lego Batman spin off's greenlit.Therefore, most have hit their animated quota. Perhaps reconsider making an exception.This reviewer attended Book of Life with his mother, and enjoyed it thoroughly.'Dia de los Muertos'; ever heard of it?That's Spaniard for 'Day of the Dead.'The Skeleton Twins, a dusty quirkedy released in September, touched on the same theme.BOL's tone is a bit more light-hearted.Cheech isn't the only one singing, either.Diego Luna as the voice of the protagonist, Manolo, strums and clucks a number of ballads. Expect minor swooning.Perhaps he's not perfect in the musical realm, but Luna does a bang-up job. He's more soft-spoken than your average hero, but that's what makes his character endearing.Channing Tatum is quickly becoming my favorite actor. Love that dude.In the past two years he's been fantastic in 22 Jump Street, Side Effects and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Plus he did three cameos: Two live-action in Don Jon and This is the End and one voice-acting as Lego Green Lantern.Speaking of street-jumping, Ice Cube plays the voice of the Candle Maker. His character is very similar to the caterpillar from Epic.In other odd news, the Candle Maker is arguably the most Caucasian character in the entire cast. Which is similar to Tracy Morgan's performance in The Boxtrolls; he too voices a white guy.Ice Cube's great. He never mails in a performance, and seems like a real stand-up guy. Keep it up, Cube!Another favorite, Zoe Saldana, enchants as the voice of Maria. This science-fiction titan plays major roles in the Star Trek and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.Maria is a lovable delight.Which comes as no surprise when dealing with Ms. Saldana.Finally, perhaps the most praise should go to Ron Perlman and Kate del Castillo, the voices of Xibalba and La Muerte.They play the two most interesting characters, and are perfectly suited to the task. They're the only ones that have to perform two separate voice roles, because their characters undergo a transformation.Del Castillo navigates a particularly difficult role. At one point she must do an extended scream and gracefully pulls it off.Which can't be easy!All in all, The Book of Life is a great addition to 2014's animated canon.We'll see who tops the leaderboard, come November 7."
50,The Book of Life,,18 January 2015,"""Mexico is the center of the universe...""","This started off really well. It grabbed my interest with its cultural aesthetic and vibrant colors. I'm not a big fan of this style of 3D animation and I didn't love all the character designs but it was different from most of what we see in animation today so points for that. Unfortunately, beyond the visuals and a few funny spots, this isn't very good. I was bored through a lot of it. The characters are one-dimensional and clichéd. Even when they fight back against a cliché (the damsel in distress showing she knows kung-fu), that just feels like another, more recent cliché. Everything having to do with the girl and the two guys she has to choose between is hackneyed. I wish they had spent more time on the mythological stuff because that's when the movie was at its most intriguing. There are also some lame cover versions of pop songs that intrude throughout the movie. The worst part? ""Toro I am sorry."" I won't say more than that. You'll see. I hope that wasn't supposed to be profound because I was laughing my butt off."
51,The Book of Life,1,20 October 2014,Please do not take your young children to see this movie,"As a 3D movie this film this film is not one of the best, I only noticed one episode of an object being thrust at the audience and one brief indecipherable flash of something on the edge of the limits of vision. The animation is as good as it should be with today's technology, not outstanding. The story line starts modestly and then fades quickly into pathetic garbage. The idea that it demonstrates the interesting and lively character of Mexico, or does anything to promote ethnic understanding and respect is sadly laughable. I saw at least one representation of a character that came close to 1930's nazi style lampooning of certain people. I saw it at a free screening and still found it objectionable and totally unsuitable for anyone with a young impressionable mind."
52,The Book of Life,10,3 January 2015,"a Wonderful , Heartwarming story for all ages...","This is one of those movies that makes you rethink your life and decisions , it sparks a flame of confidence .

53,The Book of Life,8,19 October 2014,A roomful of wooden dolls . . .,". . . come to life in THE BOOK OF LIFE, in a less scary way than a typical ""Chucky"" flick. This probably should not be a great surprise, as BOOK OF LIFE is a cartoon targeted, in part at least, toward children. The opening segment features a group of ""detention kids"" being indoctrinated that Mexico is the center of the Universe. Most of the movie does not seem to be saying that Americans ought to turn California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma over to that country, however (though doing so would solve the U.S. border problem, if those half dozen states could adopt a status similar to the DMZ between the Koreas). BOOK OF LIFE constructs an entire alternative theology to the Catholicism for which Mexico is known, along the lines of THOR or HERCULES. The presence of apparently Catholic nuns in this film may confuse the younger members of devout families, so those sort of parents may be well advised to read a synopsis or parental guide. Otherwise, this is probably not the worst cartoon feature in general release this year."
54,The Book of Life,8,5 January 2015,Loved it!,"The Book of Life is without any doubt the best animated Hollywoodmovie of the year! It has been a while since I've seen so much narrative creativity, magnificent colours and wonderful animation coming from Tinseltown. Producer Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) chose this one well. With songs from Mumford & Sons, Pixies, Elvis Presley, Rod Stewart, Biz Markie and Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros being sung by the cast, it even gets a pleasant musical vibe. Add a strong female character (Maria) and the great voices of Ice Cube, Cheech Marin, Gabriel Iglesias, Plácido Domingo and Danny Trejo (none of them are main characters but they are, ironically, more memorable than Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana, Channing Tatum, Ron Perlman and Christina Applegate) and you've got yourself one of the most enjoyable pictures of the year. According to director Jorge R. Gutierrez this is the first part of a trilogy. If the writing for the next two movies is as good as this one, I will be looking forward to those chapters! Especially the one about Maria should be awesome. Make your inner child see The Book of Life. Really."
55,The Book of Life,10,29 December 2014,What a beautiful story,"What an amazing film , all the plot , all the animation , simply beautiful . Its amazing how you can put such a strong message and such strong scenes with all this singing , partying and loving . A must watch . Loved it . Amazing soundtrack. Its beautiful to see that people never actually die , as long as they are remembered in the ones that they love the most . Is very important to know in your heart and in your soul that one doesn't simply go away . If a person means the world for you and you cant picture your life without her , then fight fo that connection! Give everything you have and even what you don't have , use your last breath if you have to , use all your strenght and all your heart to be able to hear the voice of the ones you love one more time . But always knowing that they wont go away , as long as you remember them ."
56,The Book of Life,9,12 December 2014,"Great Fun, a Perfect Film of Romance and Comedy","I didn't have very high expectations going into this film. I thought it would simply be a feel-good movie that I would certainly like, but not necessarily love or quote after seeing it. The plot is only somewhat predictable and the jokes, one-liners, expressions, the whole thing makes the audience laugh throughout. Being a film also about romance, sure, there is a little bit of cheese, but in reality, it's quite well done. The music is a wonderful add-on as well, bringing in some modern day tunes sung ""mexican"" style. Just, honestly, a fun and funny movie all throughout.This film, from an animation point of view, was absolutely incredible...animated in a way that no one has really seen before.This is definitely a recommend from me. And who made this film again? 20th Century Fox? Anyway, very good very classy and very entertaining.And FYI, all you Channing Tatum fans (especially girls or people that love his comedy), knowing that the Joaquin character plays him, you'll love this film, too. He's pretty good at the whole voice over thing :)"
57,The Book of Life,9,4 December 2014,This Book Brims with Life and Makes Death Look Downright Fun,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsProducer Guillermo del Toro's name is all over ""The Book of Life"", even though it was conceived, co-written, and directed by animator Jorge Gutierrez. It's an understandable association, though. The film is just macabre enough to feel as a companion piece with del Toro's other films, which often fuse a child's-eye view of the world with the grim and the uncanny. Gutierrez's animated film is a family-friendly story that celebrates Mexico and Mexican culture, in particular, el Dia de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead), the holiday reserved for communing with one's ancestors who have passed from this world. It's a potentially grisly setup, but the actual movie makes death look downright fun.Before settling on a fairly conventional love triangle, the film gives some context to the Day of the Dead, an annual tradition in the Latino world. The film affectionately illuminates the symbolic nature of the celebration in which the living recall and reconnect with the dead. Along the way, ""Book of Life"" also proudly and ambitiously spotlights larger themes of Mexican culture and heritage.Without a doubt, the animation is a triple-shot latte to the eyes, with sweeping scenes that make Mexican folk-art come to colorful, cinematic life. This folk-art theme plays through with lead characters that are intricately hand-painted figurines made out of wood. Even with all that eye candy on display, Gutierrez manages to keep his pop-up-book spectacle from drowning out the movie's noble intentions.The plot-dense film scripted by Gutierrez and Doug Langdale opens with sassy museum tour guide Mary Beth (voice of Christina Applegate) leading a group of unruly students to an off-the-grid section where the magical Book of Life is stored. Mary Beth acts as the capable (and much-needed) narrator, filling in the background of a somewhat complicated storyline. The captivating legend involves feuding wife-husband deities who place bets on whom Maria (voiced by Zoe Saldana), a young girl will marry when she blossoms into a full- grown woman. Will it be Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna), a sensitive guitar-playing romantic stuck in the family tradition of becoming a matador? Or will it be Joaquin (voiced by Channing Tatum), a handsome soldier-hero more concerned about himself than others? (A word must also be put in for Tatum's gamely willingness to render the somewhat reproachful Joaquin, considering he's the biggest star in this background ensemble).La Muerte (voiced by Kate DiCastillo), the more compassionate deity, places bets on Manolo. She rules the Land of the Remembered - an exuberantly joyful region where our beloved forebears go when they die, and where they live in festive, communal immortality to be fondly recalled by the living. Her estranged and cunning husband Xibalba (voiced by Ron Perlman) - a green, glowing, grinning beast covered in candles and chains - rules the dreary Land of the Forgotten - a joyless place where a whisper can turn you into dust; this is where you go if nobody in the Land of the Living remembers you. Less a devil and more a lovesick trickster, Xibalba bets on Joaquin and convinces his beloved Muerte to stake their kingdom on which boy will marry the girl - the winner gets to rule the Land of the Remembered while the loser get saddled with the Land of the Forgotten for all eternity. Besides, the trickster that he is, Xibalba surely won't let anything be left to fate, and decides to give his champion something that can only be deemed as way more than an edge. We know whom we're rooting for now. There's also a godlike entity called the Candle Maker, voiced by a rather unexpectedly joyful Ice Cube.)With its myth-building, large cast of characters, shifting narratives, and time periods, the whole setting is a risky thing to pull off. But the film juggles it capably, even as the screenplay shuttles back and forth from Mary Beth to the three lovebirds. In that way, it's a true original, even if it adheres to a few obvious staples. Like many animated films, ""The Book of Life"" inserts snippets of well-known songs, along with some written for the screen. Still, as Manolo is a musician, this fits with his character perfectly.Such a crowded, colorful, more-is-not-nearly-enough aesthetic could easily have felt garish and confusing. But for some reason, it doesn't. Maybe it's just the fact that, as the story becomes more and more predictable, the imagery gets more delirious. The Land of the Remembered feels at times like a roller-coaster ride crossed with a carnival, in keeping with the film's festive take on the afterlife. There's no color scheme, there's just color, everywhere  which makes sense, because we miss it all when we enter the Realm of the Forgotten. And it's this eye-popping sense of wonder actually helps mitigate the film's more conventional elements. The too-cute-by-half contemporary pop songs played by street musicians, for example, feel somehow more surreal when done against such a crazed colorful backdrop; and the hero's predictable journey through a visually florid underworld becomes something we anticipate, rather than just jadedly accept. ""The Book of Life"" may be all surface...but wow, what a surface!The most memorable animated films devote equal energies to storytelling ingenuity and eye-popping visuals. Jorge R. Gutierrez's ""The Book of Life"" balances both, creating glorious new worlds through words as well as imagery. The result is an enchanting 3D animated, family film that adults and kids both can relate to. Even though the movie isn't on a par with ""The Lego Movie"" or ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" released earlier this year, it comes mighty close, and surprisingly even nudges ahead of ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"". Without a doubt, it is one of 2014's best animated films; a holiday delight that exuberantly bursts at the seams with irresistible cultural pride."
58,The Book of Life,7,15 November 2014,The most accurate review of The Book of Life - PART 1,"Okay I'll just go out and say it"" This is currently the best example of how to make an animated film specifically directed at kids"". All people who want to pursue a career in entertaining kids with films should take notes from The Book of Life. I definitely wouldn't call this a masterpiece of animation by any stretch, but for what it is; this film has earned a substantial amount of my respect. The Commendations It is best start off the review with what makes the film really good. When I first saw the trailer the only thing that hooked me to this film was the animation. I am a humongous fan of art style in animation. My mouth drools at the sight of unusual animation that is outside its genre box. The film is not just beautiful and lovingly well crafted, but it also utilizes a genre of animation that is barely seen around the world. The book of life is made up of what I like to call craftsmanship animation. This type of animation takes something from the real world and applies onto the cast of main characters, and the world the plot will take place in, no matter the genre of animation the film uses. It is rarely done because of how hard it is to do. Another thing that this film does well at is how demanding it is. Most films that are directed at kids normally don't know what they want to be from beginning to end. The story itself is just a means to an end. The book of Life is an animated film that just wants you to have fun with it. The film right off the bat is telling the audience that it wants us to watch it in a specific way so that we can get the maximum entertainment out of it and enjoy the film. It's not trying to teach any cliché morals and it really keeps up with the theme of Day of the dead, speaking of clichés. I love how the film uses pop culture references. It just makes fun of them, and it's clear that they chose specific references to make fun off, so thankfully they didn't choose any ones that are meant to be downright annoying. Dare I say the Harlem shake? The jokes they tell in the film work 7 out of 10 times. The story itself is nothing truly new, but the themes of Death, Life, and family feel new because most kid films are afraid to show children what reality has in store for them, even at their young ages. I'm happy the film wants to break out of the norm, and they thankfully don't make it too obvious. The cast of characters are also great. The Criticisms While I enjoy praising this, it unfortunately is flawed in many places. The best place to begin would have to be the intro, which is the most criticized scene in the whole film. A bus holding a small group of detention kids takes them to a museum. The moment the kids get off the bus you have more than enough reason to be worried that the film might turn out bad. For the most part anytime the kids appear on screen they are pretty annoying. I understand that they are in the film to allow the fantasy elements to go wild when needed, but it doesn't mean they have to be the type of kids that nobody likes, nor do they have to be perfect role models. Earlier I praised the book of life's animation immensely, but I can't give it a perfect 10 score for two reasons. The film rarely does anything remarkable with it until the near end, that and they applied the wooden puppet style to the humans which just feels unfitting. The humans are interesting to look at, but to a certain degree. Another problem that I found in the film was that there was WAY too much contrivance. Because of this it makes the film come off as too demanding, which it is not if you pay close enough attention. It also hampers the replay value. Many viewers love to have the option of going back and looking into a film as deeply or as shallow as they want to. Because of the large amount contrivance, that doesn't happen. The next thing to talk about is the story's pacing and execution. Specific scenes feel too short and don't allow the audience to get the full experience. A perfect example would be when we're shown the land of the remembered. I forgot to mention this but another problem with the animation is that the book of life doesn't allow you to explore the worlds they have created to the fullest. Once again the example would be the land of the remembered. I like the characters for the most part, but the film doesn't do justice to certain characters, especially those integral to the plot. Not all of the pop culture references work. The final criticism goes to the movie's songs. Only two of them fit well with the story they are trying to tell. My opinionsI thought the film was pretty good, and I consider it one of the greatest animated films of all time for what an example it is. As I said before this film isn't a masterpiece, but not all greatest animated films have to be masterpieces. They just have fit a certain criteria. They must be able to stand the test of time, have something that makes their film stand out above the rest, and lastly they must define what an animated film is. Definition- Make an entertaining film and use said animation to your advantage. This review will be continued in part 2"
59,The Book of Life,7,18 October 2014,Unique Halloween Family Film,"I saw ""The Book of Life"", starring the voices of Diego Luna-Elysium, The Terminal; Zoe Saldana-Guardians of the Galaxy, The Terminal; Channing Tatum-White House Down, Step Up; Kate del Castillo-No Good Deed, Under the Same Moon and Ron Perlman-Sons of Anarchy_t.v., the Hellboy movies.This is an animated movie that has a unique look to it. The characters look as if they were puppets that came to life, but without the strings. It's produced by Guillermo del Toro and centers around the famous Mexican folk tales about the Day of the Dead. It uses vibrant colors, good music and has a great voice cast. Besides the main ones that I mentioned above, I remember hearing Danny Trejo, Christina Applegate, Cheech Marin and Ice Cube. The story involves a love triangle between Diego, Channing and Zoe, all childhood friends that grew up together until Zoe was sent away to school. Diego is from a long line of bullfighters and is expected to carry on the family tradition. The only problem is that he would rather play the guitar and sing than kill a bull. Channing is also trying to live in the shadow of his father, a great war hero. He is also quite full of himself-egotistically speaking. Kate and Ron play gods of the nether worlds that take bets on the love triangle; Kate bets on Diego to marry Zoe first and Ron bets on Channing to win her hand in marriage. One of the messages centers on family and how people should remember their past. It's rated ""PG"" for mild action, rude humor and some scary images and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
60,The Book of Life,8,16 January 2018,"A flawed, but still fun film.","If there is something I love in an animated movie, it's a story that takes us to other worlds and lets audiences dive into the cultures of foreign countries. It's always nice to see audiences learning about peoples traditions around the world. So, I'll be happy to say that you might enjoy ""The Book of Life"". However, I'll just say that this movie has flaws. A lot of them. Some of them actually did annoy me to the point where I began to think that I would hate the film overall. Luckily, that was not the case. I'll get to why this movie has some problems in a little bit, but first let me tell you the story of the film.As a bunch of students from a school are given a secret museum tour, the tour lady begins to tell them the tale revolving around the Book of Life. It revolves around two boys named Manolo (Diego Luna) and Joaquín (Channing Tatum) trying to win the hand of the lovely girl María (Zoe Saldana) unaware that the boys are actually part of a bet made by the spirits who rule the Land of the Remembered and Forgotten respectively, La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) and Xibalba (Ron Perlman). Though both tries to get her hand, neither seems to succeed due to the problems of their families. However, when an incident involving María seems to get her killed, Manolo decides that he wants to see her with all his heart, unaware that he will be accidentally sent to the Land of the Remembered by Xibalba. After discovering the wager and realizes that Xibalba cheated, Manolo swears to try to get back to the Land of the Living in order to protect the village from an incoming danger which I won't spoil.At first when the film started, I will admit that I wasn't exactly getting into the film. Though its story had started with promise, some annoying moments which will be brought up in a bit really were getting on my nerves. However, when our lead gets to the Land of the Remembered, the film really picked up its pace and became both exciting and funny. I loved how much creativity was put into the movie and the cultural elements that were put into the movie though I feel that some elements could have been treated with more respect which is strange considering this is from a Mexican director with help from famed director Guilllelmo del Toro. As for it's animation, this was definitely the highlight of the movie. It's absolutely beautiful. There was so much color and life put into it leading to some very eye-popping moments. As for the characters, they have some charm to them. I think my favorite character in the movie was Maria. I loved how she actually had some toughness put into her and Zoe Saldana really put a lot of edge to her making her very relatable. Now let's get to my problems. One was the music choice. Considering this film is set in Mexico, there were some weird moments were music like Ode to Joy and Carmen were played and just left me scratching my head. Some of the humor at the beginning was also a little immature and did annoy me though it heavily improved when we got to the Land of the Remembered. I also feel that the film won't be timeless. For example, Maira states while she was in Europe she took fencing lessons which made sense, though later during the climax, she also says she learned kung fu. Wait, hold on a second. Kung fu? Where did that come from? Elements like that made no sense. However, what really annoyed me about the film were the song choices. Throughout the movie they put in some mariachi covers of songs like ""I Will Wait"" by Mumford and Sons and even ""Creep"" by Radiohead. I mean seriously? Who in the world wants to hear a mariachi cover of Creep? I really don't know who and in all honestly don't want to know. That's really all the flaws I had.""The Book of Life"" does have a lot of problems, but luckily the film did improve and allowed me to give this film a recommendation. Though the story does have a slow start, it does improve and it's animation is definitely what makes it worth watching. When you watch it though, just be prepared to sit through a few less than stellar moments."
61,The Book of Life,8,19 December 2017,An underrated film,"I personally love this film. It was really good. Not only does it capture the Day of the Dead very well, but it is both funny AND emotional. No wonder Reel FX learned after the disaster they caused with Free Birds.I think Jorge R. Gutierrez must've been influenced by Don Bluth and/or even John R. Dilworth when it comes to making this film, and that is awesome.I love the animation, the characters, the humor, the acting, a lot of things in this movie are really good.I even enjoyed the song ""No Matter Where You Are"". Even my mom loved this film. I find Manolo a very likable character.I highly recommend this film if you're looking for an animated Day of the Dead film, other than Disney and Pixar's Coco."
62,The Book of Life,7,22 October 2017,Day of the Dead!,"A good movie to watch this time of year! A bullfighter, who wants to be a singer, tries to win the hand of his true love, Maria! And he must go through the Land of the Remembered on the Day of the Dead to do so! The animation is really cool, and original! I especially liked the vibrant colors of the Land of the Remembered and the beautiful look of La Muerte! The music in here is also cool, with guitarista ""covers"" of Biz Markie, Elvis Presley, Rod Stewart, Mumford and Sons, and an awesome version of ""Creep"" by Radiohead! The movie was a hit with my 9 1/2 year old daughter too!"
63,The Book of Life,8,14 October 2017,"Colourful, energetic fun","""Book of Life"" spins an animated fable through three worlds, ours, a fantasy world of wooden characters, and the lands of the dead, both remembered and forgotten (a great concept). The colour-soaked animation is mesmerising in places, especially the joyful world of the remembered dead. The story is a bit simple, given the complexity of the visuals, but still watchable and the characters are entertaining. Given the Latino themes, I found some of the voices in my English version a bit out of place (especially Zoe Saldana's) - I can't say why I'd have preferred everyone speak in Spanish-accented English but I would have. All-in-all, a fun movie that's worth watching if only for the aesthetic experience."
64,The Book of Life,9,3 October 2017,Amazing Family Movie,"As a large movie lover, owning over 1000 on DVD, I found The Book of Life to be an excellent movie. This movie is an excellent choice for families. I would give the movie a nine out of ten. I believe that this movie earns this because of its story, ability to relate to characters, overall message, and influences from Mexican culture. These factors make it a great teaching moment for families with small children. They get to learn about other cultures while getting some amazing entertainment from relatable characters. The Book of Life is about three kids, Manolo, Joaquin, and Maria, who are the best of friends. These friends learn to overcome obstacles such as distance, and jealousy to keep their friendship alive, and healthy. In the beginning the three mischievously release pigs destroying parts of the town. At this point we find out that Marias dad is the mayor of the town. Maria gets sent away for many years, and both the boys end up falling in love with her. They overcome these things realizing that their friendship, and their connection to one another is more important than the love for Maria. The three ultimately defeat the villain, and save their town. They may relate to some of the characters opinions on how their children are acting. For instance, there are times when we see Manolo and Maria arguing with their parents, and not doing want they want them to. In these times we see their parents getting mad and raise their voices. Parents can relate to the feeling of children not wanting to follow their rules, or not doing what they ask of them. Children are able to relate to the main character, and they can feel like they are not the only ones that feel some way. As in their not the only children who don't always want to do what their parents want them to. The overall message in The Book of Life is to follow your heart. This message is good for all young and slightly less young. It is good for parents to hear that they can follow still follow their dream, and that their children can also follow their dreams. The main character did not want to follow the life that his father, and grandmother laid out for him. Instead he wanted to follow his heart by play an instrument. Some parents may see this as disobedience which may cause them to be upset, but I believe that the overall message is stronger that the fact that Manolo went against his father's wishes. As I've stated the movie depicts many Mexican cultural influences. The movie is set in Mexico showing many of the things that happen in the culture such as bull fighting, multiple generations living in the same home, and names of people. The movie also shows the strong sense of family. In Mexican cultures family is the most important thing. We can see this in the way that they have large families in the in the land of the remembered (part of the afterlife). The afterlife also incorporates pieces of Mexican culture such as sugar skulls and Mexican food items. The cultural influences are sprinkled into the entire move making it partially educational. If you're looking for a good movie for your family to watch over the weekend The Book of Life will entertain all family members no matter what the age. The movie is great for giving an insight to Mexican culture bringing families closer. Especially because it shows that family is the most important thing."
65,The Book of Life,9,26 August 2017,A Fantastic Halloween Classic That Is Very Underrated,"This film came out in the same year as The LEGO Movie and It become a Overrated classic and It didn't get nominated for an Oscar and the Internet went Insane of It.They say It's the film everyone will love and love forever, being their favorite and being very popular, well..... I liked It, BUT, this film (The Book of Life) I think should of been what the LEGO Movie is apart from the LEGO Movie being a big selling product with LEGOs, but this movie was unbelievable!, everything about this is just...FANNNTASTIC!.The story is sweet and well executed, the animation is oh my god.. JUST AMAZING, it's bright, colorful, creative and very well done, the characters are funny and likable, the Environment defiantly has that Mexican/Day of the Dead feeling to it, the soundtrack Is a lot of fun to listen to!.Only problems is the story is kind of predicable and the characters are kind of bland, but besides that this film is A LOT of fun.You are your family will have a blast with this, buy this on DVD/Blu-Ray when you can.This get a 9/10."
66,The Book of Life,9,27 May 2017,WHY haven't you seen this movie?,"This is one of the greatest animated films I have ever seen and with 5 kids, I see a lot of them! Our whole family enjoys it - there's a little something for everyone. It's visually captivating and very funny. The music is another winning aspect. There are some old favorites, Mexican style, and some very touching love ballads as well. It's just an all around great story. Do yourself a favor and watch it!"
67,The Book of Life,10,20 December 2016,Amazing and Wonderful!!,"Manolo, a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart, embarks on an adventure that spans three fantastic worlds where he must face his greatest fears. The Book of Life was one of the few films that i saw back in 2014 that was not just beautiful in the outside but on the inside as well for example the characters were fantastic especially Manolo and Maria, there was a bit of singing here and there and gave the film more depth and also more drama. But i also loved how much they respected the Mexican Culture and that was one of the reasons why i loved this film because it was so down to earth and so beautiful i mean every single character in this film was so down to earth and lovable even the villains at one point. Overall i'm gonna give The Book of Life an A+"
68,The Book of Life,8,3 June 2016,"oh yes, this is also for adults!!!","I never write any review as I think movies are far too much personal. What is a 5 to one, is a 9 to other. But i had to write something at least about this one. I don't know if was just me, but i got mixed felling about this one. Weird really. In one minute I'm about to stop watching, the next i'm laughing, in others,having some knot in my throat (that's what a good movie suppose to do with you, isn't it?). Really beautifully shot. Great soundtrack. A bit of the Mexican culture seen in a way we can understand it. If you are a fan of animation, watch it. If you are a fan of life, watch it. If you just want to kill some time, watch it. I bet you won't regret!!!"
69,The Book of Life,6,1 December 2015,Not the Bible.,"The Book of Life (2014): Dir: Jorge Gutierrez / Voices: Diego Luna, Channing Tatum, Zoe Saldana, Ron Perlman, Christina Applegate: A diverse animation about one's true potential. It regards two competing males for the love of one female in the back drop of the Mexican Day of the Dead festival. Manolo Sanchez grew up in a family history of bull fighters. His father urges him to continue the tradition but he really desires being a musician. Joaquin is touted as the town hero and applauded by everyone. Maria is the romantic interest whom they both compete for since childhood. A bet is waged between the spirits of two worlds that seem to represent Heaven and Hell. A female spirit of the Land of the Remembered bets that Manolo will marry Maria. The spirit of the Land of the Forgotten bets that Joaquin will marry her and he cheats by equipping him with a magic medal as well as have Manolo bitten by a snake thus spiralling him into the Land of the Remembered. He must get back to the surface to life so to stop Maria from marrying Joaquin. The screenplay is creative until its pathetically corny action climax. The animation is terrible with horribly distorted faces and necks. The themes throughout with the festival may be too intense for young children. The three principal characters are appealing with voices by Diego Luna, Channing Tatum and Zoe Saldana. Other characters are not very broad, or are too overly corny to even identify with. The theme seems to be hitting one's highest potential but unfortunately this film doesn't hit its highest potential in terms of its target audience. Score: 6 ½ / 10"
70,The Book of Life,8,21 November 2015,ingenuous  funny,"This has a touch of Spanish culture to it . The wooden animation is so vivid that you will no longer call horrible acting as 'wooden' . There is a lot of content as well as laughs . You won't hate any character by the end . My personal favourite is candle man .Songs are worth listening again . Seems , there are no limits to animation . We have seen 2D tom and jerry ; clay animation like bob the builder , jojo's circus ; then blocks animation in lego 2014 ; now puppets hold sway . Animation medium is powerful in right hands backed by a story . it will touch your heart . roles of every character have been researched in detail . educational stuff in it too presented in an enjoyable way ."
71,The Book of Life,8,16 November 2015,"Really good, i recommend watching this","This movie animation is quite good,but the characters are wooden and does not fit the movie that well, it's a colorful the story line and the ending is one of the best I've seen so far, although it's a bit heart breaking when the main character ""Manolo Sanchez"" died just to see the love of his life ""Maria Posada"" , but it turns out she's alive.He had to go through many obstacles that was caused by the evil god ""Xibalba"". They were childhood friends, but the main character Manolo is in love with maria from the beginning but there was another boy which is also in love with maria, he is known as ""Walkine"" the son of the hero of the town. All in all, i really liked it. I hope there will be The Book of Life 2 coming soon, because I'm looking forward to it."
72,The Book of Life,8,8 October 2015,Dia de los Muertos,"The Book of Life is an unconventional animation film in some aspects. The art and character design is the first thing that grabs you and says ""Look at this! This looks beautiful"". The characters are created like marionettes; their limbs are joints are loosely attached and stylised as if brought to life by strings above them but they move with the same fluid motions that all modern animation has. I particularly am enraptured with the design of the married but feuding deities in Xibalba and La Muerte. One is adorned with skeletal armour and white facial hair and burns with comic fury in the green fire candles all over his body. The other has a lavish coat of make-up that gives her the look of the living dead, and wears a gigantic brimmed sombrero laden with skulls, candles and flowers. Manolo is transformed into the living dead when he passes on to the Land of the Remembered, his face turned ivory white and his eyes black as the night, but he is still familiar to us. He is voiced by the Spanish actor Diego Luna who turns out to be a fantastic choice, flamboyant in his wooing of Maria yet tender whenever he chooses the guitar over the twin swords and ""plays from the heart"". His musically ability is the basis for the film's best moments; when he plays the acoustic with sincerity in the original songs such as ""I Love You Too Much"" and ""The Apology Song"", we are reminded of the character he really is. The climatic battle is not a battle at all, but a renouncing of the past killings and a heartfelt apology for the life he does not want to live. The credits song, by Us the Duo is sweet and satisfying. The Americanisation of the other musical elements is less satisfying, using tunes from bands like Radiohead and Mumford & Sons to decent effect, but they feel manufactured because the lyrics are too exact. Manolo's opposite is also a product of this; he is voiced by Channing Tatum and never attempts to be anything but Channing Tatum. His pompous personality immediately makes obvious where the narrative is headed and how the romance will be reconciled. And of course, he redeems himself in a way. Ice Cube's The Candle Maker is also like this. He is shoved into the film in order to provide a little comic relief; he spouts inappropriate one liners and even throws in a little womanising in the mix of his ghetto personality. It's a familiar and grating character that pops up in many animations. Still, the candles makes for an elegant symbol for one's life. I particularly like this one scene, where Carlos saves children from the bandits and prepares to fight the bid bad Chakal, both of them hurling themselves into the air, swords out and posing, before we cut to a candle being extinguished. A rather elegant way of visualising his sacrifice while not demeaning his character with a one sided action sequence. It's rather remarkable how stunning the animation looks in The Book of Life for a budget of this size. At the first wide shot of the underworld, we are immediately aware of the festivity of the setting. It bursts with colour and energy and we are as overwhelmed as Manolo is. The characters (dead relatives) comes thick and fast, mostly as comic relief. Each are unique and prove to be worthy in their own way. This is a lavish celebration of the Mexican holiday. It's wrapped up in a rather conventional story device of a museum guide retelling a myth from a storybook to wide eyed kids, with voice-over narration at key moments. But although this is unnecessary, it doesn't detract from the main storyline. There are a few flaws, but it's easy to get swept up in this world."
73,The Book of Life,7,15 July 2015,A fun children's movie that portrays many thoughtful messages!!!!!!!,"The Book of Life is a 2014 American 3D computer-animated adventure musical comedy film produced by Reel FX Creative Studios and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Co-written and directed by Jorge Gutierrez, it was produced by Aaron Berger, Brad Booker, Guillermo del Toro and Carina SchulzeIn the Mexican town of San Angel, Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zoë Saldana) and Joaquin (Channing Tatum) have been friends ever since childhood. Although their lives have taken different paths -- Maria was sent to Europe, Joaquin joined the military, and Manolo studied to become a bullfighter -- one thing remains the same: Manolo and Joaquin both want to marry Maria. Little does the trio know that battling husband-and-wife deities have made a high-stakes wager on the love triangle's outcome."
74,The Book of Life,7,12 July 2015,Life as Myth,"On the Day of the Dead we celebrate the lives of those we remember, but there are those who have been forgotten, so we must never forget...The Book of Life takes a group of ""at-risk"" children on a visit to a museum, but they get the tour that very few get. While the physical tour is quite short the majority is through the story-telling of the Queen of the Dead and has qualities reminiscent of the story-telling done in The Princess Bride: audience interjections and story-teller descriptions.The story is an ages-old story familiarized in Romeo and Juliet, but leaves the tragedy behind as our hero binds those who are living to those who are dead to defeat the evil that exists in the world.The Book of Life seems to be a good jumping-off point into Latin American mythologies. This and the interesting animation that appears at times to be stop-motion makes the film an interesting watch."
75,The Book of Life,5,23 June 2015,interesting visually but movie lacks tension,"Museum guide Mary Beth takes a group of rambunctious children on a secret tour of the Mexican afterlife. Underneath the town of San Angel, La Muerte is the good ruler of the Land of the Remembered, and Xibalba is the mischievous ruler of the Land of the Forgotten. The waxy Candle Maker keeps everything in balance. La Muerte and Xibalba make a bet at the Day of the Dead festival. La Muerte bets that Manolo will marry María and Xibalba takes Joaquín in the bet. Xibalba cheats by giving Joaquin his Medal of Everlasting Life. María is sent away to Spain after freeing the pigs from slaughter. Manolo gives her one of the pigs as a present. He is pushed into the family business of bull fighter but he refuses to kill. Maria falls in love with him. Meanwhile Joaquín has become an invincible fighter against bandits due to his Medal.I don't know how much input producer Guillermo del Toro contributed into this project. Director Jorge Gutierrez comes from more of a visual arts background. It's his full length directorial debut. I like the unique colorful look of the movie. It's always nice to have something different. The story does lack tension. The three human leads don't stand out enough. Joaquin needs to be more evil. La Muerte and Xibalba are actually the most fascinating characters. The story and the characters need a few more passes with the word processor."
76,The Book of Life,8,24 May 2015,Nonstop frantic pacing was exhausting,"This movie is full of frenetic energy and the pacing is consistently frantic from beginning to end - and that's its biggest problem: It doesn't know how to slow down.Things are darting around and bouncing all over the screen in every single scene. Throughout the entire film, it felt like every couple of seconds or so, it cuts to another slapstick moment or visual gag or witty wisecrack, as if it can't sustain a single moment without injecting another attempt at humor for distraction. The movie acts like the audience has a two-second attention span.To be fair, this type of low attention span approach is a trend afflicting a lot of American-produced animation these days (a couple of other recent big offenders that come to mind are Lego Movie & Wreck-It Ralph.)...The visual design is a mixed bag.First, the good: The environments are spectacular and impressively designed, probably the best part of the film (although it rarely actually slows down quite enough for us to really admire the environments). The wooden puppet look of the characters is unique and creative.But, the bad: Aside from the major characters (the only attractive-looking character designs), almost all of the people in the movie have a goofy ugly look, with pig-shaped or long dangling wart-covered noses, round bodies, and oversized-heads with exaggerated mouths & teeth. Maybe this look is supposed to be funny, but everyone's so hideous that it kinda turned me off from the film....As for everything else about the movie, it was generally okay. The songs fit the mood, but were nothing too great. The major characters were generally likable, I guess. The plot starts out as just a cheesy love-story for a while - and I was a bit bored - but it gets better when the Day of the Dead theme really kicks in mid-way through. But by the time it descends into the action-packed finale towards the end, though, it didn't even feel like it had even built up any extra excitement leading to that point, because I was already pretty exhausted by the nonstop frenzy of everything that kept happening up until then."
77,The Book of Life,5,21 May 2015,"It's okay, but I don't know how I feel about the casting","Let me start out by saying that I love Disney movies like crazy, even though I'm almost at the drinking age (XD) and I was extremely excited when I heard they were going to make a Hispanic princess finally. The movie was incredibly beautiful with its color and rich background, and the story itself was entertaining enough. But being a Latina myself, I can't help but cringe when one of the American voice actors butcher the pronunciation of Spanish words. It's not their fault, I know, but there are plenty of Hispanic actors in Hollywood, so couldn't they have picked them instead? Again, loved the movie, but not the cast itself. Apart from that, I grew up hearing these stories and I was immensely pleased for the rest of the U.S. who are not familiar with our culture to learn something new and unique. We are more in touch with our roots compared to other religions, and it is something that has always made me immensely proud of being a Latina"
78,The Book of Life,7,7 April 2015,Sweet cartoon!,"When I want to make kids happy I show them a cartoon. It was not different this time. However, there were some small kids involved, and they could not follow the plot. This plot was geared towards older children and some adults who can not live without cartoons. I really liked this film. Visual effects and voices borrowed are excellent. I also liked the plot, although it was difficult to pay attention while watching this film since kids were restless.I also liked the music in the film.So basically I can call this a sweet little cartoon to be entertained with kids you need to babysit. If you like cartoons and if you want to entertain some kids for some time, this is a film for you."
79,The Book of Life,,4 February 2015,A cultural tale,"This animated film tells the story of two best friends fighting for the same girl, which results in an epic fight to save the city on the day of the dead.I did not know about the folklore that gave rise to ""The Book of Life"", but after watching it, it has certainly captivated me. The story is told by a museum staff to a bunch of misbehaving children, and it is very engagingly told. The visuals are colourful and delightful, as they are vibrantly coloured and elaborately designed.I really liked the story, because it is full of fantastical elements, and yet still close to human nature particularly because of the wagers. People like to win! I liked the ending a lot, because the characters shows much courage, brotherhood and selflessness. I enjoyed watching it a lot."
80,The Book of Life,,14 January 2015,Refreshing,"If the eye candy doesn't win you over the surprisingly solid plot definitely will. There is so much to like about this movie; adults can sit back and enjoy without that dreaded ""kids movie"" feeling that your brain is going to drip out of your nose. For the most part the characters feel real, as are their challenges and decisions. Meanwhile a cool and refreshing take on a rarely told story is spun against a variety of colourful locations. Songs? It has them, usually custom versions of hits you'll have heard before. I wouldn't say that you can sing along to them but they do seem appropriate, and show the movie is comfortable having a nice tongue in cheek laugh at itself.I took off two stars because I think the way the movie starts and ends wasn't really necessary, and one of the characters is just too easy to dislike and too difficult to identify with (possibly over-moralising). But overall it's very worth a watch."
81,The Book of Life,10,4 January 2015,Outstanding,"After seeing this movie, I have never felt such pride in being part of a Hispanic heritage. I can truly relate to a lot of the scenes from this movie and the songs were so well written that they pulled at the heart strings in ways that only songs can. My mother and I watched this movie and were met with surprises, laughter, and whole hearted family fun times. The beginning story is a bit over played, however I enjoy the originality they add into the mix later on. Just when you think it's good it gets better. I was fairly surprised when I saw a lot of Hispanic writers and producers, as well as voice actors and actresses. Just imagining that the writers all sat at a table and reminisced about when they were children growing up in Mexico or Spain and other countries made me feel like I could connect with them. However, most importantly, this movie made me feel like I was home. I recommend this movie to anyone who celebrates any and all parts of Hispanic culture."
82,The Book of Life,7,2 November 2014,"Gorgeous visuals, all else left to be desired.","BOOK OF LIFEThe second feature-length production from studio Reel FX, following on from - and a big improvement on - last year's abysmal 'Free Birds', revolves around the Mexican tradition of Dia de Muertos - the 'Day of the Dead', which celebrates and remembers those that have passed away. The vibrant colours that are used in these celebrations are mirrored brilliant on screen, making this possibly on the most beautiful films to view. Unfortunately, everything else falls short.The story begins promisingly, and through the first half, is set up nicely and is entertaining. Come the second half, everything seems a little rushed and familiar. Seems like too much time was spent on the beginning, and a sudden 'oh crap, we need to wrap this up' mentality took over.For those taking their under-8s, there are many laughs aimed at the younger audience and they'll love the graphics, but it's a shame there's not any more for the accompanying adult. The voice cast has a few big names. Channing Tatum and Ron Perlman to name a few, while the former's take on a Mexican accent is very questionable.All in all, there are many films that the family can enjoy more than this, but it's a unique view into Mexican folklore with a stunning look to match."
83,The Book of Life,7,22 October 2014,One of the best-looking animated films I've seen in a long time,"I found that ""The Book of Life"" didn't really work when it came to the humour, but the art direction and the overall design of the film was so bold and so striking that I was easily able to get over it. I'm not at all familiar with Central American/Mexican traditions, but I assume this animated film is based on a traditional fairytale. First thing you need to know is that there are two places where humans go when they die. The first is the Land of the Remembered, where it's a party all of the time and you go to find all of your loved ones. The second is the land of the forgotten, a place of misery where the people who are no longer remembered/mourned by their families slowly fade away into oblivion. The rulers of these two realms are La Muerte (voiced by Kate del Castillo), who reigns in good place and her husband Xibalba (voiced by Ron Perlman) who rules the gloomy place. They observe a trio of best friends: beautiful María (Zoe Saldana), brave Joaquín (Channing Tatum) and sensitive Manolo (Diego Luna). The two rulers of the dead each back up one of the guys and they place a bet on which one will win María's heart, with the Land of the Remember as the prize to be won.I'm not sure if it's the fact that the humour was just aimed at a significantly younger audience than say... 27-year-old amateur movie critics, but I felt that it felt really flat. It's not that it was cringe-worthy with bad fart jokes or that kind of thing; it's just that I didn't laugh or even chuckle very much during the entire runtime. Maybe the writing is just kind of weak, or that I had the additional hindrance of being so distanced from Central American traditions that I don't even know what a ""churro"" is, but it didn't resonate with me at all. Normally that would have probably killed the film, but I actually found that I enjoyed it a lot overall despite this. The main reason is that this film feels totally fresh from a plot and visuals standpoint.One of the major reasons why I tend to lean towards hand-drawn animation more than CG animation is that at a certain point the films begin to kind of all look the same. There's no need for the animators to get creative in their renditions of hair for example because the technology is so good they can simply create realistic-looking hair on their characters. There's no need to come up with creative shortcuts for the backgrounds or costumes anymore because 3-dimensional objects can easily be manipulated to be seen from any angle or to flow across any surface. I'm not saying that computer-generated animation is easy, or even bad. I'm saying that sometimes the lack of limitations makes the films look too similar to each other. This is where BOL comes in. Just look at these characters, with their puppet-like designs, their exaggerated features (the hair for Maria, the torsos for the men) and their unmistakably Mexican look. Is there anyone out there who could ever mistake them for characters from any other film? I sincerely doubt it because the three main characters of this movie are the blandest ones! If you look at the side characters in this film, their designs are absolutely insane! We have people whose faces are 2-dimensional, a fat mariachi who would probably have an easier time rolling around than walking, characters with noses that look like pink, twisted pickles... and then there are the inhabitants of the land of the dead! I can't give enough praise to the character designs in this film. Even the way they move is so unique. I mentioned how everyone is ""sculpted"" to look like puppets. That means the characters move in a way that is totally distinctive. Their bodies do not change shape because they're treated as if they were really made out of wood. You would think, then, that the characters would move awkwardly, but they are fitted with just enough joints to make them very mobile and expressive. I hope they make these characters into real-life figurines because they would be absolutely beautiful to see.Once again, I have to mention that the film is breathtaking to see. It's so colourful and so unique. I need to look up art director's other works and see if any of them are half as good as this film's. But, there's more to a movie than just the visuals. What about the story? It's totally original and filled with characters that are not just stock fairytale heroes and villains. My favourite was probably María. Yes, she's the love interest that everyone pines for, but she is aware of that and unwilling to become a stereotypical damsel in distress or a prize to be won. She is a real character, as is everyone in this film. Best of all is that this is a story that to my knowledge has never appeared on-screen before; nothing like it has. There's been surprisingly little of the Mexican culture brought to the big screen and it's like I was craving to see this spectacle... but I didn't even know it until now. Yeah, I kind of wish the writing had been better, but the freshness makes up for it.We have great music (including some original pieces), fantastic visuals, smart characters, an original story and breathtaking art direction. On the negative side, we have jokes that don't really work. Oh well, you can't win them all. Even though I wasn't the target audience for ""The Book of Life"", I was really impressed and I give it a high recommendation, particularly if you have an affinity for the culture on display here. It's a real feast for the eyes. (3-D theatrical version on the big screen, October 21, 2014)"
84,The Book of Life,,22 October 2014,Fantastic but not Oscar nomination,"I am stunned that other here on IMDb are saying this is an Oscar nomination, WoW. I hardly would ever consider this for an Oscar. I went to see this movie after a long wait with my daughter and I can tell you KIdS these DYAyS know a lot about novies. We got only about half way thru about when the popcorn was done when we find ourselves so bored and the screen was so uninteresting. Don't get me wrong in Europe the November 2nd is a big national holiday to celebrate the day of the death, and yes I like the idea about it very much, and yes the music and graphics are great and as an avid movie gore this one was pretty flat for us. Very much Into 3D and beautiful cartoon stories, but this one was just simply over the top. Too much color not enough emotion, I My daughter literally walked out of this movie half way thru totally not interested and let me tell you, she watches cartoons pretty much her entire life. I guess I was expecting too much from reading other reviews on here and i run into cinema to see it and what a disappointed !! certainly not an Oscar, howere surely yed a grest grapics but not deep to connect, , fast cutting just like in CSI, no thanks , really UNInTErEsTeEd!!! We watched Boxtroll and it was thrilling and fantastic all the way thru till the end and my daughter totally stayed and watched every but of it. If anything is for Oscar is Boxtroll not Book of Life, what a silly museum story !!! No no no. Love culture hate stupid flat stories !"
85,The Book of Life,9,20 October 2014,Funny,"It kind of spoofs the bible in a way. There is a character much like the Christian god with his occupation and one like the devil, and places parallel to heaven and hell. But it seems they switch behaviors and personalities this time and it was hilarious. At the same time, most of the other main characters have no parallel, so there is a bit of original pieces, too. I do admit that it might be hard, at least it was for me, to not focus on these parallels. That was my only problem with it, though, and the characters still made me laugh like crazy. I had trouble stopping the laugh too. I am sure i will be dreaming tonight and I am also pretty sure it wont be a nightmare. I don't think this is Oscar winning work, but its still good."
86,The Book of Life,5,11 January 2015,I expected a lot more,"This is a film that will definitely be better appreciated by children than adults. I was very interested in this film when I first heard of it - the visual style did not stun me, but I am a big fan of Mexican culture and some of the names attached to this project made me think that it was in good hands.Many people praise the visuals, but while they were colourful and interesting a lot of them were very... ugly - primarily concerning character designs, though the main characters look wonderful.The story was a bit too generic. I was expecting something more rooted in the culture, but the Day of the Dead and Mexico seemed like more of a backdrop than a part of the story. It could have been set anywhere with any kind of mourning celebration and happy afterlife involved. I'm sure children would enjoy it, but as an adult I found it unsurprising and simplistic. On a more specific note, the story being bookended by some delinquent kids learning about the story of Maria, Mandolo and Jaoquin alongside us was unnecessary and can be a little annoying when they interrupt something mid-scene with comments that only the young kids in the audience would find funny.The voice acting could be a bit spotty - the native Mexican actors like Diego Luna and Kate del Castillo do a fantastic job, however Zoe Saldana and Channing Tatum seem to have a lot of trouble keeping their accents straight, which can be a little distracting.The soundtrack for this movie was terrible. The original songs are pretty good and fit in with the story well enough - but someone decided to put already famous songs into the film that took me out of what I had invested in the world. ""I Will Wait"" by Mumford and Sons being included very early on in the film feels forced, like they wanted to capitalize on the success of the song at the time. Other choices like ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" and ""Creep"" were just bizarre and using Biz Markie's ""Just a Friend"" for a quick gag seemed misguided and really shows the writer's preference for using pop culture references for humour rather than genuine cleverness. Overall, I'm disappointed to say that this film is more of a ""kid's movie"" than a ""family movie"". The film is generally predictable and the humour is very forced. I snickered maybe once or twice and got fairly bored of the film halfway through. I would recommend it to someone who wants a fun little film for their kids, but not for much else."
87,The Book of Life,9,19 March 2015,Loved This Movie,"I've saw the movie when I watched it with my little brother, age 3, and little sister, age 10. I am 18 and we were not bored at all! The Book of Life has a wide ranging cast from Zoe Saldana, Channing Tatum, Ice Cube along with many more. This proved to be an amazing mix despite the cast's differences in their typical movies. I also fell in love with the songs as well as my siblings. There was also a variety of top songs that were covered with a Mexican feel to it. They were catchy and of very good quality compared to many other songs featured in children movies. The graphics also were bright. There was always something to admire. The overall storyline was a refresher from much of the typical Dreamworks or Disney ones (not trying to say they produce bad movies). It also great to bring up Mexican culture in a positive light since it's been getting such a bad rap lately. This is a movie that is going to defiantly be a classic for me and my family."
88,The Book of Life,9,10 March 2015,Truly Beautiful,"Everything from the animation to the story itself is a true work of art...It is beautiful. The animation is exquisitely drawn and the actors were perfectly chosen. If you understand Mexican culture/history you will love this movie. If you do not understand Mexican culture/history you will love this movie. If you know very little about Latin culture, you will come away wanting to learn more about it and its history.. This is a film about love. It is a film about family. This story is an homage to cultural literacy and it is an invitation to fall in love with a tradition you never knew you've loved all your life. It is beautiful."
89,The Book of Life,6,10 January 2015,"Gets Better As It Goes, But...","Manolo (Diego Luna), a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart, embarks on an adventure that spans three fantastic worlds where he must face his greatest fears.Of the titles expected to be nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards, this is among the weaker (though not the weakest). Primarily, this is due to the wraparound story with Christina Applegate and the class of unruly kids. This was annoying and really served no purpose (exactly what sort of museum they were at is very unclear).The actual story of Manolo and Joaquin was excellent, with some good plot elements, fantastic worlds that have not been explored before... why have we not used Mexican mythology in our films? This seems like such a great resource. Some of the animation was a bit odd (particularly the noses), but all in all was quite good.While this cannot compare to the heavy hitters like ""Big Hero 6"", for something a little different it might be worth checking out."
90,The Book of Life,7,17 December 2014,A fun and colorful film for the whole family,"The Book of Life is a wonderful film and perhaps the most creative animated film of the year (granted I have not seen Big Hero 6 yet). The color scheme is vibrant and the look of the film is a great homage to Day of the Dead art. The story is fun and the voice acting is great, I especially adored Placido Domingo's supporting role. I was a bit disappointing that composer Gustavo Santaolalla's prodigious talents were not fully utilized, though he did write some of the songs that are used in the film. The story is fun and not obviously generic like many animated films, with interesting characters. I'm definitely looking forward to the next offering by Reel FX Creative Studios."
91,The Book of Life,,26 October 2014,Mexican folklore family fun,"Children are taken on a secret museum tour by a tour guide who tells them about the famous legends and myths of Mexican folklore.More family friendly and not as dark as Burton produced Nightmare before. Producer Guillermo del Toro and director Jorge Gutierrez deliver wonderful colourfully rendered 3D cgi animated characters. Jumping from the past to present and from one world to the next it's full of fun and surprises with great voice characterisation from an array of stars. While lacking all original song numbers it's still perfect Halloween family viewing with Mexican ghosts, bull fighters and bandits."
92,The Book of Life,,22 October 2014,"Giddy, joyful and full of life . . .","The Book of Life is a joyful, giddy experience, brimming with energy and life, which is odd to say since much of it takes place in the land of the dead. But don't let that description dissuade you, just because it is about the dead does not mean it's a dreary experience. It's more about remembering those who have come before, honoring one's heritage, and being true to yourself. It's all there but not in a preachy manner.The movie is bursting with creativity, it not only honors Mexican culture and the Dios De Los muertos, but it also honors the animated form. Animators work with more freedom than the creators of live-action  they have to create an entire world completely out of scratch. Yet, somehow in the last few years, the animation market has been overstuffed by uninspired retreads of familiar  and not to mention safe  subject matter. The characters are as bland and forgettable as the stories they tell.The Book of Life is different, and it's creative engine is provided by Guillermo del Toro, the whip-smart filmmaker who previously gave us Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth. With The Book of Life, he puts together a beguiling experience that looks and feels new. Dispatching the usual band of roly-poly characters, the occupants of this film look like puppets, wooden puppets right down to their hinged-joints. We feel that we're watching a marionette performance without the strings  the effect is not only great pop art, but it's kind of magical.The story is simplistic, but not simple minded. It begins in the land of the living and involves a love triangle between three childhood friends: good-hearted Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna) who wants to break his family's bull fighting tradition by becoming a mariachi singer. There's spunky and independent Maria (voiced by Zoe Saldana) who Manolo will be in love with forever after. And there's Joaquin (voiced by Channing Tatum), a rustler-buster whose medal-strewn military uniform hides a great deal of insecurity. They both love the beautiful Maria, but it is Manolo who loves her from deep down in his very DNA. In one brief, magical moment, he serenades the beautiful Maria with his rendition of ""I Can't Help Falling in Love With You."" It's a moment that will break your heart.Outside of their mortal coil, the trio are being watched by two married deities, La Muerta (Kate del Castillo) and Xiabalba (Ron Perlman). They watch over The Land of the Remembered, a happy place where people go when they die, and also The Land of the Forgotten, a dreary place where the dead go when the living forget them. The two make a bet on the love triangle. La Muerta bets that Maria will choose Manolo, while Xiabalba has his money on Joaquin. The winner gets to rule the netherworld.What happens next, I leave for you to discover. Yeah, you will probably be able to see what's coming next, but the story is not the point. The film's great joy is the glorious worlds it creates. It is one of those rare animated films that never stops reinventing itself. The movie excels in its tiny details rather than overwhelming with its broader intentions. There's a trio of squeaky angelic nuns, a mariachi band that murders ""You Got What I Need"" (a song that was half-dead to begin with), and a bull that is part parody and part steampunk nightmare.What makes the film special is its willingness to go for the jugular. The ball gets rolling and it doesn't stop for the insipid detail of most animated features these days. When it does slow down, it's for tender moments between Manolo and Maria that create a special bond  you feel that they're really in love. If the movie fails at anything it may be that the casting (which is made up mostly of Hispanic actors) sometimes goes over the edge. I liked Channing Tatum's mustache-twirling machismo as Joaquin, and I liked Zoe Saldana as Maria, but honestly, the movie clangs when we meet the overseer of The Land of the Remembered, voiced by Ice-Cube with all the predictable hip-hop renderings and sign language  he brings the movie to a dead stop (no pun intended). That limitation aside, this is still a magical experience. It's something new in a genre that relies on the familiar. It's fun, it's energetic, it's got great music and great animation. This is one of those films where the filmmakers really cared."
93,The Book of Life,4,22 March 2015,"Unrealistic, childish characters, and stupid","The characters look like blocks that I want touch (like robots). And their lower bodies are too little for their size. It may seem more innocent, but it was actually cloying while being way too dark for young children.There were too many crying children in the theater due to how scary it is.The plot was all over the place - it's just about this guy trying to stop this villain and I found my mind wandering and just realizing that it's a love story. The guy soon dies along with his girl and go to this Limbo-like place to fight off the villains, which I had mixed feelings about because I didn't like the fact that you came to like Manolo a little bit until he dies, but it's also interesting how they fight in the upper world and the afterlife, ruined by a twist where they come back alive, Maria in a fairy tale way, and Manolo just gets back up to the real world.I did not care for the characters, nor for some of the drama. Especially the kids, where you got the precocious, clichéd Manolo fighting off bulls and the impulsive Maria wanting to be on animals a little bigger than her. What is she like, 4? When the talented Manolo grows up, it seems to get better but it's ruined by a weak script and unrealistic, clichéd, saccharine romance. By the way, the characters were saccharine anyway.I just wish it had more conflict to it. The characters are always winning and they're forgettable. They like to fight each other.Lastly, the movie is too weird, the characters designed as skulls when they go to 'Limbo' with orange eyes and even in the rain scene, Manolo's eyes were orange when it stormed."
94,The Book of Life,1,7 June 2015,truly bad ... don't subject yourself / your children to this ...,"it's puke ... pure unfiltered puke ... just awful ... where do i even start ... i don't think i've ever watched something which is so simultaneously racist and sexist and awful all at the same time ... the artistry is barely barely unique ... it's a horrid mix between ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and fox's ""The PJ's"" , with a lot of overkill Mexican and pseudo black ghetto stereotypes obtrusively blended in ... the 2 main male characters are distinctly and blatantly split with one as a privileged alpha D-B and the other a B sensitive artist ... of course the female lead character is a jealous fickle entitled princess witch ... the extreme degree of non-stop racist drivel and slapstick is beyond any understandable or forgivable measure ... to expose children to this is offensive at best , intentionally damaging at worst ... i don't know who this is actually supposed to entertain ... but it's not me ... i imagine if i were a 3-5 year old mentally disabled child being raised in an impoverished half-racist American-immigrant Mexican household that was both partly ashamed of it's own culture while also desperately trying to imitate a warped caricature of American rap gang culture i *might* enjoy the rapid colorful movements of the awful awful ""characters"" ... to call this ""art"" is an insult to art ... if i could un-watch this , i would ..."
95,The Book of Life,7,2 November 2014,Be Original All the Way,"I may be an old fogie, but once again an animated film can't be completely original. The characterization here is masterful. The premise of the Day of the Dead is unique as a foundational entity. What is done with the wooden headed figures set in a mega-colored environments is about as creative as anything I've ever seen. This could have been a great film. But what happens. Instead of going with the marvelous story that has been set up, the movie eventually moves into just another presentation of tiresome karate punching, pop music, silly rap stars voicing gods, and a lot of other 21st century culture. It cheapens the whole thing. While the movie is pretty engaging, it is hard to understand at times what the rules are. Are these real elements of Mexican mythology, or is it a fantasy world that simply said is ""anything goes."" Honestly, I did not hate the movie, but I thought that with the great director, George Guttierez, things would play out in a totally original way. The usual sellout which, I suppose, appeals to the twelve year old. That's what it is ultimately about."
96,The Book of Life,6,28 October 2014,It's Animation time.,"You know what time it is? It's Animation time.The book of Life is about a young man finds himself on a path that can go two different ways: to follow the expectations of his family or to follow his heart. But before making a momentous choice in his life, he must face his greatest fears - and the fantastical journey begins.What I really like about this movie is that it's different and so it's so colorful with it's animation, and the movie has some frighting scenes about death and the other world that might scare kids, but just like most kids films we see we do see scary and messed up scenes in some kids movie.The good things in the movie: The animation in this movie is so colorful and so bright that my eyes couldn't get enough of the beautiful animation that was right in front of me. The voice acting was pretty good, the movie takes it different twist and turns which I like. The Problems: My problem with the movie is it's Jokes, the Jokes in the movie sometimes work and sometimes didn't, and they use modern music mix with old Mexico music and that to me didn't really work for me. Overall I didn't love this movie, because the movie has problems but let's not forget it has it's good parts, and that's why I do think it's a fun time a theaters and it's a harmless movie for young auditions, well for some kids."
97,The Book of Life,7,28 October 2014,Music Contrast,"It was lovely but I was not impressed with Gustavo Santaolalla's music this time around. It's a bummer because the artist music in contrast was wonderful. Especially Mumford & Sons and Edward Sharpe! Listening to them really improved the soundtrack for my family. The music Santaolalla composed sounded cheesy and did not help the film at all. I am surprised and disappointed. The film was graphically beautiful & I really enjoyed the story of the gods. La Muerte portrayed by Kate del Castillo was on point. I honestly think the bull fighting song should of been better. It was not believable. I am totally against bull fighting and am glad that the film took this stance but again... the music failed me. And that is nothing on Diego Luna, whom I admire a great deal."
98,The Book of Life,6,29 October 2014,Curious story yet with plot Holes here and there,"It's a story inside a story. A tour guide tells a story of the Mexican culture of the Day of the Dead to some kids. There are two worlds of the dead, the heaven-like Land of the Remembered ruled by La Meuerte, and the hell for forgotten souls, the Land of the Forgotten ruled by Xibalba. Xibalba wants to trade places with La Muerte, so he makes a bet with her about who will marry Maria. Xibalva bets on Joaquin while La Muerte chooses Manolo. As kids the three are best friends, though both boys compete for Maria's heart. Manolo comes from a long line of matadors, although he likes music more. Joaquin is the son of the town's fallen hero. One day, Maria sets loose a boar accidentally. Manolo saves the town using his matador skills on the boar. But Maria's father General Posada, who was saved by Joaquin, didn't see it and instead blames Manolo for the boar. Mariais punished by being sent to a school faraway. Manolo grows to be quite a skilled matador and Joaquin becomes the town's hero thanks to a medallion of live Xibalba secretly gave him. Maria returns home after school. The three reunites at watching Manolo's matador debut. Manolo refuses to kill the bull, disappointing his father, but amazes Maria. At night, Manolo sings to Maria to win her heart but she refuses, after previously denying Joaquin of a similar request. Manolo and Joaquin confronts each other over Maria but she refuses them. Manolo asks her to meet him later. Xibalba transforms his staff into a snake to hunt Manolo. Manolo and Maria meet and have a romantic time where he wins her heart. The snake comes and launches at Manolo. Maria pushes him aside, gets bitten, and dies instantly. Joaquin and the general blame him for her death. Manolo goes back to the meeting point. Xibalba appears transforming his staff into a two-headed snake which kills Manolo. Manolo's spirit goes to the Land of the Remembered where meets his ancestors.With his family, Manolo visits La Muerte's castle. He finds Xibalba there, who explains about the bet and that Joquin revives Maria with the pin. With his mother and grandfather, Manolo braves the journey to the Land of the Forgotten. He finds La Muerte and informs her about Xibalba cheating. She confronts Xibalba and Manolo offers a new bet. If Manolo succeeds Xibalba's task, he'll go to live again, but if he fails Xibalba can rule the two Lands. Xibalba tasks Manolo to fight all the bulls his family ever kill at once. Meanwhile, the bandit lord Chakal has heard about Joaquin's medal and goes to town to get it, halting Joaquin and Maria's wedding vows. Manolo wins the task by singing and taming the bull. He lives again right in time to help Joaquin fight Chakal. Manolo and Joaquin almost defeats Chakal when he ignites the bombs in his belt. Manolo and Joaqui pushes him under a bell, trapping Manolo and Chakal inside it as the bombs blow up. Manolo survives the blast thanks to the pin Joaquin passed on to him. Manolo then marries Maria, and Xibalba and La Muerte make amends. The tour guide turns out to be La Muerte and the guard with her is Xibalba.The story is quite detailed and intricate for a children oriented animation movie. Yet there are illogical plot holes scattered here and there. Those include the lack of clarity of how could Joaquin and Maria's marriage save the town from bandits when even general Psada states that only Joauqin can defeat Chakal. Also, why didn't Xibalba get in Manolo's way of going to La Muerte. But as an overall, the story is quite engaging to keep one seated to watch what happens next.The animation style choice is really quite peculiar. But it figures out after seeing the big name of Guillermo del Torro in the credits as the producer. As one who is known for experiences in different genres, The Book of Life (2014) may indeed be something for him. The movie features a story from his home of Mexico, after being involved in Hollywood movies and and working with Hide Kojima in Konami's new horror game. The quirky choice of animation particularly on the human physiology reflects also his tendency for experimenting in the makeup and prosthetics area.The voice acting is quite a nice job. The actors keep their own characters and accents in their voices. This is good because they don't really force non-Hispanic decent actors to do any fake accent, which may dim their characters. This also helps the audience in recognizing whose voice it is behind the animated character.Ron Perlman's voice is easily recognizable, as so does Channing Tatum's and Christina Applegate's. On the other hand, the voices of Zoe Saldana, Diego Luna, Kate del Castillo, and Danny Trejo are even more distinctive with their almost signature accents.My say is that The Book of Life (2014) deserves a 6 out of 10 score. A recommendation is honestly a so-so choice from me, as there are other better movies around. But it's quite a good choice for an animation for this time of year due to it suits the moment."
99,The Book of Life,6,20 October 2014,The Book of Life: What's with Mexicans and death?,"For what it's worth, as the producer of this film, Guillermo del Toro looks like he had a massive amount of influence on the visuals and textures of ""The Book of Life"". And the distinctively Mexican look of each marionette-like character is a breath of fresh air in an animated day in age where the objective is to close the gap between real life and CGI. The music here is also a plus, as some semi-memorable original songs are used, as well as latinized renditions of modern songs like Radiohead's ""Creep"". As for the story itself, it is fairly memorableor more accurately, serviceable. And isn't that what we all want in a children's movie? Something serviceable.Beginning with a lazy ""gather around, while I tell you a tale"" setup, ""The Book of Life"" comes to life when the actual Day of the Dead folklore portion of the story begins. Telling the tale of two friends, Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna) and Joaquin (voiced by Channing Tatum) who fight for the heart of the beautiful Maria (voiced by Zoe Saldana) and the gods, La Muerte (voiced by Kate del Castillo) and Xibalba (voiced by Ron Perlman) who bet on them; yes, this is an overused Disney-esque premise, but should still be considered tried-and-true.But issues arise as it becomes noticeable fairly quickly that ""The Book of Life"" is a nearly humorless film. That is not to say that the Jorge R. Gutierrez (who also directed this feature) and Douglas Langdale script doesn't attempt to inject a healthy dose of children's humor into this children's film. It just doesn't seem to work, as 95% of the gags fall flat and had a theater full of children waiting in silence; for better or for worse, I guess.Final Thought: If the ""Book of Life"" does not garner Oscar attention, it will inevitably be blamed on some kind of racial insensitivity. But while I (a proud Mexican-American) believe there is importance in this tale and give kudos to del Toro for gifting the Mexican (Mexican-American) community an animated film for the whole family, the fact is ""The Book of Life"" stumbles in its attempts to compete with the child-engaging content of better animation studios such as Pixar, DreamWorks or even Laika Entertainment."
100,The Book of Life,10,9 September 2017,Best movie I have ever seen!,"I just love it!!! A romance, action and comedy movie for children! What more does it need? It's perfect! Joaquin and Manolo trying to win Maria. Just a good plot. The adventure has pretty good action and humor! The scene of Manolo winning the judging part I was just so glad to come across this joyful movie! Must see movie! Like watch it NOW!!"
101,The Book of Life,3,3 November 2015,Good enough,"Two best friends fight for the hand of beautiful Maria, but their love battle is more than that, as the gods of the dead had bet on who will win her in the end. Okay, okay, I shouldn't be too hard on this one. The colours were really beautiful and some parts of the story really good. However, some times the story felt rushed and the characters under developed, not to mention that it didn't make much sense. Of course you could easily guess which one Maria will pick from the beginning, so the suspense from there was gone. Well, the twist was nice, and the action was satisfying, but other than that, the book of life won't be a movie that I will remember, so 3 out of 10."
102,The Book of Life,5,15 April 2015,Spanish Movies,"i was having an argument right now about movies with my dad. .. i'm watching the Lord of the Rings at the moment, and my dad came in and started warming up a tortilla. then i started to think, that Mexicans and Spanish people should be making huge awesome movies like lord of the rings but Spanish and Mexican style. LotR is definitely a north euro ancient style movie, or Celtic and Norse style. Very beautiful. Yet, all races and heritages have ancestry as old and as beautiful as that. It's all layers of style. Plus, there are tons and tons of American Cetic movies. How many Spanish Roman or ancient Spain movies that are high quality, made?? barely any, if any. You cant tell me that Mexicans or Spanish people don't have the money because they absolutely do... its just Spanish people either don't care, or get caught in bullshit. These are huge events and projects that we humans do on this planet, and I being a Mexican (this life) would like to see some really awesome, all Spanish, high budget, high quality, movies made! I get in these Celtic phases sometimes because I love the ancient ways, and I am reminded that at one point, Rome took over north Europe or the Celtic people. That is written in 99% of the history books on this planet. Yet... at this time, the Spirit of the Celtics are Kicking the Romans asses!!!!! Come on Spanish people..."
103,The Book of Life,10,2 April 2015,An unexpectedly great film,"When I saw the trailer for this film, I was very skeptical about it because I was conflicted on the language of the movie says on Wikipedia, whether it is an English-language film or a Spanish- language film, since it is a film directed by Mexican animator Jorge R. Gutierrez. But after doing some extensive research, I learnt it is an American animated film produced by Reel FX, so English is the original language of The Book of Life, with some Spanish combined into it. I have also learnt that English does not have to be the mother tongue of the filmmaker when they work at an American animation studio. Hey, take a look at Stephen Alpert at Studio Ghibli, a Japanese animation studio. He is an American animator, so that means English is his mother tongue, that he was even one of the original Japanese voice talents in Hayao Miyazaki's The Wind Rises, where he voiced Castrop, and did an outstanding job voicing the character.Now to the actual movie.The Good: 1. Excellent animation 2. Great cast of characters, like, Manolo, Maria, Joaquin, Mary Beth 3. Awesome voice acting, courtesy of Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana, Channing Tatum, Ron Perlman, Christina Applegate, Ice Cube, etc. 4. Great storyThe Bad: Nothing much I can say about the badIf you are interested in watching an animated movie, definitely go see it."
104,The Book of Life,7,14 March 2015,Not bad movie,"Good movie but not the best!!I like the story but not the part when that guy died and he goes to another world and he goes back to the earth!I like the characters and that pig is so funny.I saw the movie and I enjoyed the movie. I laughed a lot! Song choices were so funny sometimes.This movie is not recommended for the kids (only for 12+). The musical aspect was quite good too. Against what I was expecting, the use of modern songs was moderate, and each one of the musical moments this movie has serves in some way or another for the plot and character development, with more than effective results. This aspect, combined with all the other positive qualities this movie has serve to make it a very good animated film for the whole family."
105,The Book of Life,6,15 January 2015,A stunning visually impressive tale which could have been a lot better,"The Book Life has really impressive visuals and animation coming from ReelFX studios whose last venture Free Birds was really terrible. Filled with romance and drama at the same time having bits of humor here and there it was an adventure I enjoyed. Also the touch of Mexican culture and beautiful songs really add the sparks to it. There are few twist in the tale, still it follows the routine hero saves the day sequence by the end. The thing is The Book of Life had great potential, it builds up nicely in the first half which was breath of fresh air, but the story is a let down in the second half.The hero here is Manolo, a man in city of San Angel in Mexico who falls in love of Maria. Also his best friend Joaquin falls for her, leading to a love triangle story. Seems like a story very common, but there their stories have bigger things at stake. Romance wise the film generates really nice atmosphere with its songs. The voice cast impressive, watch out for Ice Cube as Candle Maker which was quite a surprise. While the tone and story seems suitable for kids but there are elements like animal-cruelty, being selfless, etc. which might be learning thing for all in general. The characters are nicely written, I only wished they did something and surprising for the finale which felt too cliché. Also the plot involving bandit 'Chakal' as bad guy was quite lame and was used only for setting up an action packed finale. Still, The Book life doesn't feel like your day to day animation movies because of its interesting premise. The animation is probably one of the best of the year, very vibrant and colorful. Definitely worth a watch.RATING: [3/5]"
106,The Book of Life,7,30 December 2014,Sweet and visually stunning but not spectacular,"The Book of Life's story needs some work and is pretty underdeveloped but viewers won't mind as much because of it's stunning visualizations.Produced by Guillermo del Toro, The Book of Life is a love story. It is also a battle and adventure across three fantastical worlds.Set during the day of the dead, The Book of Life allows for Mexican culture to lay down and influence the narrative. Specifically, viewers learn of The Land of the Remembered  a festive and magical place where those have passed live on in memories and a metaphysical part of the netherworld. We also learn of its opposite, The Land of the Forgotten. Xibalba rules the land of the forgotten, but is tired of its bleak wasteland environment and wagers a bet with La Muerte, the ruler of the land of the remembered. By the ancient rules a wager is set between the controllers of the two realms  over a fate of love and marriage  and so the greatest bet in history beganManolo versus Joaquin for the hand of Maria.The Book of Life starts extremely strongly and is told at first as a story within a story with a bunch of unruly school children learning about the day of the dead and the book of life while on a school trip to a museum. As the story delves deeper into Mexican heritage and beliefs we also learn about Manolo, Joaquin and Maria. At this point the film switches gears and becomes your standard narrative of love as the children grow up to be adults and the men compete for the love of the woman.The Book of Life is an admirable attempt to shed life on the relationship between Mexicans and death. The animation stylization is a vital addition to the successfulness of the film and is visually stunning. The macabre skulls and skeletons are whimsical with flourishing. The characters are distinct looking and it is clear that writer/director Jorge R. Gutierrez had a vision when embarking on this film.Unfortunately the film is underdeveloped and there is no underlying sentiment and heart to push the film to greatness. The characters are fun and compelling but seem to have no deep relation to one another. The Book of Life is beautiful to watch but not strong enough to warrant and emotional engagement that will resonate once the film's narrative is complete and the credits roll.Please check out our website for more reviews of recent releases, in full."
107,The Book of Life,6,8 November 2014,Reminds me of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas,"Yesterday I went to the cinemas(which had NO ONE in it spooky eh)and I seen The Book Of Life,as I am a lover for animated movies and its my favourite genre ever so lets dive in. There maybe an odd spoiler so you have been warned.The Book Of Life is a fantasy movie that opens with a couple of elementary kids who are at a museum and they are been guided by a mysterious red head woman who tells the story of Mauno(voiced by Diego Luna) and his best friend Joaquin(voiced by Channing Tatum who also voiced Superman in The Lego Movie) who have one thing in common they are in love with the same woman Maria(voiced by Zoe Saldana from Avatar).But when a mysterious creature gives Joaquin a brooch that is an everlasting brooch(meaning when he wears it he can't die) so if someone dies he can bring them back from the dead apparently. So both Mauno and Joaquin(which is pronounced wa-kin)fight to win the heart of Maria. But when Maria dies by a poisonous snake,Mauno dies and he is sent to another universe(and yes when you read my summary title you maybe wondering why does it remind me of The Nightmare Before Christmas),well the world that Mauno goes into reminds me of that movie that I was telling you about by Tim Burton as it would mind you of the sort of stuff Burton makes Gothic and creepy yet manages not to make the younger audience get spooked by it. So as Mauno is in this strange new world he has to find Maria,but when he discovers that she survived the bite from the snake,he must try and go back from the dead and win Maria's heart again,as well as retrieving the book of life and going into the land of forgotten.So what did I think of this movie,well its not that bad. I thought the animation was unusual and the charcthers reminded me of wooden toys like Pinocchio from some strange reason as well as a film that Tim Burton would make. The story has been done before but hey all animated films nowadays would remind you of other films in the past. The voice cast was great too in fact I though Channing Tatum did a good job as the voice of Joaquin as you wouldn't say when you hear his voice 'Oh that's Channing Tatum,as an awful lot of animated films have well-known celebs in their films and you can spot their voices a mile away.Overall I recommend you see this movie,if you want a good Gothic flick.Lets hope this will be in the Oscars next year but I have a funny feeling How To Train Your Dragon 2 will win at next years Oscars.Overall im giving this a 6/10"
108,The Book of Life,7,25 October 2014,Give death some life!,"The book of life was probably the happiest movie about death you'll see. The story was fantastic, the animation was very interesting, and the music was very effective.This movie doesn't seem to have a lot of hype behind it and was kind of a one off animation by Guilermo del Toro between the more promoted releases of The Box Trolls and Big Hero Six. It's too bad because this was a really well done film. The colourful Day of Death Mexican theme was a really new and interesting style of animation. I also really enjoyed this movie because it was billed for kids and it was one of those rare cases where I feel it was really geared towards children. It's a very positive movie and even the antagonist in the film isn't really that bad of a guy. If you have small children, don't be fooled by the concept, this movie is perfectly safe for them.The story was a little bit predictable. I think most adults will be able to predict the ending right away, but that doesn't mean it wasn't interesting or fun to watch. There is enough going on around the main plot to keep things exciting and keep you interested.I think if the story was approached a little differently, and perhaps more time was spent in the underworld, this could have been a real classic. The said, it was still a very good movie on it's own and I'd highly recommend going to see it if you have children or are just looking for something positive and pure to watch instead of the many children's movies that are also geared to adults that are coming out in droves."
109,The Book of Life,7,20 October 2014,Love in Spectacles,"The Book of Life is ought to give the mass audience a unique kind of tale for the mainstream animation genre. This is a story that is supposed to represent the Mexican culture and their legend, and when it focuses on that theme, it becomes really lovely. The more fabulous appeal is its distinct designs that brings its own color. Those merits alone immediately makes the film a whole lot beautiful, but once it gets to deliver the main story, it moves okay, but also too conventional for its own good. But still, The Book of Life is visually unique and full of heart that is guarantee a worth of watch.The story is clearly sort of a fairy tale that handles heavy themes about love and death. This is the surprising darkness that ends up being fascinating for a film that is intended for kids and families. Before the plot goes anywhere, it first takes us to an easy exposition of its rich world. This promising setup brings total spectacle, and wonderfully stays loyal to its own elements and tells the legend behind the tradition of ""Day of the Dead"". The subplots involving the families of the three main characters are also quite admirable, adding more personal depth to this larger than life tale. But when it finally moves to the supernatural adventure, it is still stunning, but it also lacks definite directions to where they are exactly going. The film, as a whole, does trouble for being often too reliant to its antics, broad humor and zany set pieces, while the sense of its theme's gravity only gets considered rarely. There is definitely nothing wrong with having too much fun, but this storytelling does need some concentration.It's the animation that becomes the best of its highlights. The characters' puppet-like appearances and their whimsical looking places are pretty much of its own visual personality. Every action sequence creates an amazing scale fun, in spite its speed may get too far. And even at the smaller moments, the designs speak through the scenes' emotions. The vocal performances; such as Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana, and Channing Tatum; charmingly bring their characters to life. And for the supporting such as Ron Perlman, Kate del Castillo, and Ice Cube as well gave a delightful job.The Book of Life has the potential of a greater movie; the story and themes, even the world it sets are nearly apart from today's typical animation filmmaking. It might as well be a little throwback from the classics when character work and lessons appeal more than anything else, but sometimes this movie just can't leave a scene without showing some grand action or any sort of silliness. Though the movie accomplished more tremendous things than its missteps. Despite much of the mess in some parts, The Book Life succeeds at showcasing the spirit that it loves to deliver. Maybe next time, it could have been a little more steady."
110,The Book of Life,7,18 October 2014,A beautifully animated and fun film you should watch if you want to learn more about Mexican culture.,"Story: While the story here is essentially a ""love triangle"" story, it is helped by its ""Dia De Los Muertos"" theme. It's interesting learning about the culture behind this Mexican holiday and how the film incorporates the beliefs into this simplistic story. The film does start out slow, but once the film gets to the ""Land of the Remembered"", it really begins to pick up. This movie does have nice morals about remembering your loved ones who passed away, fighting for what's right for the good of the people, writing your own stories, etc., but the whole ""animal cruelty is bad"" message feels out of place here. Overall, this predictable story does rise up a bit thanks to its theme and morals. 6/10Animation: This is one of the most uniquely animated films I've ever scene, especially for an American released CGI film. The character designs are well crafted and detailed to look like wooden puppets (except the humans in the real-world, they look generic), the backgrounds, especially in the ""afterlife"" are gorgeous and colorful, and the scenery is a pleasure to see. Just like with the story, the ""Dia De Los Muertos"" theme helps the animation be better than what it already is. This is a must-see if you're a sucker for eye-candy films. 10/10Characters and Comedy: Just like with Rio 2, the film suffers from too many characters which unfortunately limits the amount of character development and screen-time certain characters get. Manolo I thought was a great leading man who you can sympathize with as he tries to win the love of María who I also thought was a fine love- interest. Joaquín was also an OK love-rival/friend who gets more developed and like- able towards the end. I also like La Muerte and Xibalba (the female and male gods respectively) and their dynamic as they wager who marries María. But the rest are just too much of pain to remember their names (I suck at naming foreign people) and they don't get enough screen-time or development to be remembered (Manolo's dad was fine though). The comedy was also nice enough to raise this category up a bit. 6/10Sound: I liked the score that was here along with their Latino covers of certain popular songs. The biggest highlight of the songs was hearing Diego Luna sing some of the ballads as Manolo. He does have a nice singing voice. 8/10Acting and Casting: Everyone did a fine job with the performances, although, I wasn't all that impressed with Zoe Saldana's performance as María except for a few scenes. I really liked Diego Luna's role as Manola and Channing Tatum's role as Joaquín. They both did a great job with their character roles. The rest were fine, but not really impressive. 8/10Verdict: If you're interested in learning more about Mexican culture and Dia De Los Muertos but you're too lazy to watch a documentary on them, give The Book of Life a try and you might learn something new about Mexican culture while also being entertained along the way.Rating: 7/10"
