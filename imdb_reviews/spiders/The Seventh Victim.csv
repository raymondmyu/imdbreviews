0,The Seventh Victim,,5 January 2003,Clearing Up The Confusing Plot Line,"Many viewers of ""The Seventh Victim"" find the plot confusing.  My comment may explain why and help clear up the matter.""The Seventh Victim"" was intended as an A film, but four scenes that had been photographed were edited out, as ""Victim"" was cut to a B film's running time of 71 minutes.  This was a result of Lewton insisting that Mark Robson, who'd never directed a film before, direct this one.  The studio brass didn't want Robson and gave Lewton a choice: get rid of Robson or lose the A-picture budget.  Lewton chose Robson.Following are the four scenes that were cut.  Were they still in the film, the film's plot would make more sense than it now does.Scene 1 - Gregory Ward visits Mary at the day care center where she works. In this scene, Mary admits, ""It would be easier if Jacqueline were dead."" At the beginning of the scene which remains in the picture--of Judd visiting Mary--Mary's supervisor says to her, ""Aren't you the popular one?  You've a visitor again,"" the last word making it clear she'd had an earlier visitor, Ward, whom we don't see because of the cut.Scene 2 - Trying to discover what the Palladists have as a hold on Mary, Judd visits Mrs. Cortez, pretending to be interested in joining the group. Two points are made in this conversation between Judd and Mrs. Cortez: (a) That if good exists, evil exists, and one is free to choose.  (b) Mrs. Cortez became a Palladist because, ""Life has betrayed us.  We've found that there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's sake.""Scene 3 - Judd makes a second, longer visit to Mrs. Cortez, indicating that he is ready to join the Palladists.  In this conversation, Judd unintentionally reveals that Jacqueline is staying with Mary at the rooming house.  This lets us know how the Palladists were able to trace Jacqueline to Mary's room in order to kidnap her.  In the truncated print, viewers haven't a clue as to how the Palladists found Jacqueline.Scene 4 - A final scene, which followed Jacqueline's suicide.  Mary, Gregory, and Jason meet at the Dante restaurant.  Gregory and Mary go off together, leaving Jason standing before the restaurant's mural of Dante and Beatrice, making clear his failure as an artist and lover; he says, ""I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead.  Death can be good.  Death can be happy.  If I could speak like Cyrano...then perhaps, you might understand.""In the British release print, Jason recites the entire Lord's Prayer to the Palladists, while only two lines of the Prayer remain in the American print, which is the one usually shown.""I run to death and death meets me as fast,/And all my pleasures are like yesterday"" are from Donne's Holy Sonnet 1, lines 3 and 4.  I believe the film credits them to Donne's Holy Sonnet 7.Details about Lewton insisting on Robson as director and the cutting of these four scenes can be found in ""Fearing the Dark: The Val Lewton Career"" by Edmund G. Bansak (McFarland) and ""Val Lewton: The Reality of Terror"" by Joel E. Siegel (Viking)."
1,The Seventh Victim,,17 August 2001,moody suspenseful gem worth seeking out,"This little known and scantily screened Val Lewton masterpiece is a must see. The eerie atmosphere established at the boarding school where Kim Hunter learns of her sister's disappearance continues throughout. Scenes including her nightmarish experience in a darkened cosmetic company hallway illustrate how far afield recent film has gotten from true suspense as sustained in the imagination of the viewer. The chilling normalcy of the lives of the Satanists she comes to be pursuing in an effort to understand what has happened to her sister, and their quiet menace as they later gather forces to will the suicide of one of their ranks is gripping. The scenes depicting her sister's frantic run through the streets to escape a pursuer will remind others of the opening of Lewton's other little shown film The Leopard Man. Viewing this film further reinforces my belief that an intelligent film patron does not need to be clubbed over the head by excessive gore and violence to be truly scared by a film if the story is intriguing and the execution is as good as in The Seventh Victim."
2,The Seventh Victim,10,20 October 2005,Must see picture,"I saw ""The Seventh Victim"" for the first time just last night, and found it to be absolutely captivating. The entire movie had a strange ""eeriness"" to it, that had me completely mesmerized throughout. Jean Brooks was absolutely amazing, in the role of Jacklyn (the Sister who was trying to escape the Satanic cult). It was as though she was put on earth to play this role. Her demeanor was so melancholy... One minute I was frightened for her life, and felt very sad for her. The next minute I was afraid of her! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has appreciation for black and white films. Movies of today just don't have the same way of drawing in their audience, as those old black and white pictures. I am only 28 years old, and I have always had an obsession with classic films. This one is defiantly at the top of my list, a must see."
3,The Seventh Victim,9,2 October 2000,Another stylish chiller from Val Lewton's RKO unit,"As a longtime booster of The Cat People, I tended to give the credit to its director Jacques Tourneur (later to helm Out of the Past).  Seeing The Seventh Victim, also from Val Lewton's B-movie unit at RKO, changed all that.  It seems Lewton was the resident genius, cobbling together stylish horror/suspense films on shoestring budgets.  The young Kim Hunter, away at a private school, learns that her tuition hasn't been paid because her sister, owner of a beauty empire, has disappeared.  She leaves school and starts scouring New York's Greenwich Village (also the locale of much of The Cat People) only to uncover a cult of devil worshipers.  Lewton's thrillers haven't dated the way James Whale's, for instance, have, possibly because they depend so heavily on suggestion; the literalness of today's ""horror"" films is completely alien to these suggestive, truly chilling films.  The RKO B-movie unit under Lewton was also, probably, a major influence on the look of film noir, soon to become the cutting-edge aesthetic in American movies.  This is as tense and satisfying a 75 minutes as you'll find until the Mann/Alton team's seminal noirs of a few years later."
4,The Seventh Victim,,5 July 1999,"Moody, atmospheric and unsettling","No surprise that Val Lewton was involved with The Seventh Victim, his fingerprints can be seen on every frame. Like Cat People and I Walked With A Zombie, the atmosphere oozes from the screen, although Tournier was not involved here. Young Kim Hunter tries to find her sister, only to find she has fallen into the clutches of a group of Satanists. Oddly, the Satanists are presented as a gentile bunch, no raving lunatics here, they all seem disturbingly sane. There are some magnificent images here. Hunter breaking into her sisters room to find nothing but a chair and a noose, a creepy shower scene that pre-dates Psycho and the extraordinary downbeat ending. A grim little chiller that remains unsettlingly plausible throughout."
5,The Seventh Victim,,22 September 2004,None of The Lord's Prayer survives in British TV print.,"I'm amazed not one reviewer has mentioned the outstanding contribution by Jean Brooks as the missing Jacqueline Gibson. Although she makes a late appearance Jean is very impressive in her five scenes, particularly her monologue describing how she came to join the Palladists and her nighttime flight being pursued by the assassin with the switchblade. None of the Lord's prayer survives in the print shown on British television. This is strange as two lines were reportedly intact when the film was originally shown in British cinemas.The excellent Brooks who appeared in two other Lewton films was sadly wasted by RKO and subsequently relegated to support and bit roles."
6,The Seventh Victim,10,27 October 2003,Offbeat and very creepy,"Spooky film about a young woman getting involved with a group of devil worshippers in NYC.In terms of subject matter this is ahead of its time--it was probably the first film to deal seriously with cults. The film also is the film debut of Kim Hunter (later to win an Oscar for ""A Streetcar Named Desire"") and has an early performance by Hugh Beaumont (later on ""Father Knows Best""). Also Tom Conway was in this and two other top horror films of the 40s--""I Walked With A Zombie"" and ""Cat People"".This is one of the very low-budget horror films that producer Val Lewton made for RKO in the 1940s. He was given only ""B"" actors to work with and zero money, but he turned in some true classics. He used darkness and shadow very effectively making some of the creepiest-looking sets on film. Also he NEVER showed anything explicitly--he always kept the monsters or violence off screen and just suggested at it. It works beautifully. This movie is the least known of all of them (probably because of the subject matter), but it's probably the best one. The plot and themes are handled matter-of-factly and the sets are truly eerie. The performances are all low-key perfectly fitting the script. Even the obligatory love story shoehorned in works. There's also a VERY bizarre shower sequence and a grim ending. Definitely worth seeing...a must for horror fans. A 10 all the way!"
7,The Seventh Victim,10,20 October 2002,The Most Terrifying Movie I have ever seen--and the only film I can call a Masterpiece.,"I first saw ""The Seventh Victim"" on TV when I was a highschool teenager in New Jersey in 1960.  I had no film knowledge, no idea of who Val Lewton was. Our local station Channel 9 had the rights to the RKO film library, and simply tossed ""The Seventh Victim"" into a 90-minute time-slot (a 71 minute movie interrupted every 10 minutes with a blast of commercials).  Even so, seeing this movie under the worst possible circumstances, I was nonetheless hypnotized by its eerie, morbid, downright shocking handling of a fairly typical thriller premise:  A young girl (the luminous Kim Hunter, in her first film) is informed by the staff of the Catholic girls' school she attends that her sister, who lives in New York City and owns a thriving women's fragrance emporium, has not paid her tuition bills for several months and has apparently vanished. Ms. Hunter goes to Manhattan to find her sister, whom she traces to the West Village, where the rest of the story is set.  A trustful, kind-hearted innocent girl suddenly thrust into a series of increasingly frightening situations populated by a huge cast of supporting characters (and nobody is quite what meets the eye), Ms. Hunter and the viewer are sent down a series of dark alleys that eventually culminate in the most terrifying, nerve-needling, shocking ending of any film I have ever seen. ""The Seventh Victim"" has stayed in my mind (and haunted my dreams) ever since I first saw it.  I now live in New York and have scoured the West Village for the locations of the scenes in ""The Seventh Victim"" (which, of course, was shot on the RKO Greenwich Village backlot--but is a perfect replica of the deceptively beautiful West Village as it appears even today: cobblestoned streets, majestic townhouses converted into brownstone apartments, cozy, family-run Italian restaurants, and the most colorful, fascinating, complex and entrancing people you'll neet anywhere in the entire world. This mis en scene is captured perfectly in ""The Seventh Victim,"" which another reviewer on this website so perfectly described as a series of Edward Hopper paintings brought to sinister,yet alluring, black-and-white life. I won't go into plot details, since they have been well-covered by other IMDB reviewers.  Hitchcock obviously saw this film and used its terrifying shower scene for the centerpiece of ""Psycho."" To this day, this modest, unpretentious, off-beat chiller remains relatively unknown (except for film-buffs), yet when I showed it to my guests at a dinner party a few years ago, they gradually fell under its creepily hypnotic spell, and, towards the end, when Ms. Hunter's sister is stalked by an unknown killer on the darkened Village streets, a quick camera shot of the stalker reaching into his pocket and pulling out a switchblade made three of my guests scream, How ""The Seventh Victim"" ever got past the censors in 1943 I'll never know I've read that the film had a strong lesbian undertone that drove the members of the Hays Office into cardiac arrest. Whether this is true or not, I have no idea, nor do I care. The artists who made ""The Seventh Victim"" created a true work of art-a poetic, chilling, ravishing masterpiece--a pretentious word I've never applied to any other movie, but will, without hesitation, apply to the most intelligent, audacious and spellbinding movie I have ever seen."
8,The Seventh Victim,10,18 April 2002,Unique,"I ran this tape for a few seconds to see if it was in good condition, and I was so drawn in by the hypnotic atmosphere that I dropped all else and watched the whole movie. Such is its power, it won,t let you go. Every relationship in the movie felt real and credible, despite the extreme circumstances.Lewton is  a humanitarian, which is why his movies have so much more profundity than most film noir. You really feel that you care about his characters, even the sleazy satanists (similar to the way he had made Irena the cat-woman a kind and gentle person, where anyone else would have cast her as a tough cookie). All the characters in this movie are complex people of the sort he must have known in his New York days, and the poet manque is likely a self portrait. And who else would quote John Donne's poetry in a thriller.It will take repeated viewings for me (and you) to understand The Seventh Victim, but the sombre mood will communicate itself immediately.Be alert for little details throughout- especially at the end, which comes suddenly."
9,The Seventh Victim,8,3 December 2008,"If I prefer to believe in satanic majesty and power, who can deny me?","The Seventh Victim is directed by Mark Robson and written by DeWitt Bodeen and Charles O'Neal. It stars Tom Conway, Jean Brooks, Isabel Jewell and Kim Hunter. Music is scored by Roy Webb and cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca.When she is told her older sister Jacqueline has vanished, Mary Gibson is forced to leave her private school and travel to New York City to hopefully find her. Obtaining help from her sister's husband, Gregory, and the suspicious help of psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd, Mary finds that the deeper she goes the more dangerous the situation becomes, it appears that Jacqueline has got herself involved with something very sinister indeed.He calleth all his children by their name. Coming as it does from producer Val Lewton, one shouldn't be surprised that The Seventh Victim is a hauntingly poetic creeper of a movie, no shocks or out and out horror here, just a genuine sense of dread and a pervading sense of doom. When delving a bit further into the making of the picture it becomes apparent that an original cut of the piece was considerably longer, this explains a lot to me as the film, as good as it is in its 71 minute form, is not fully formed and at times not the easiest to fully understand. It would seem that although originally intended as a longer mainstream picture, a difference of opinion between Lewton and the studio (thought to be about the hiring of first time director Mark Robson) meant it was cut to a B movie standard.The Palladists.What remains, though, isn't at all bad, in fact it's unique. Robson's direction (obviously guided by Lewton) is perfectly sedate and in keeping with the mood of the piece, and between them they have conjured up some most unforgettable scenes and imagery. One particular shower scene lingers long after the credits roll, the perfect use of a silhouette probably had a certain Alfred Hitchcock taking notes, whilst the ending is quite simply a piece of bleak and unforgettable cinema. Musuraca is the key ingredient, though, the ace cinematographer is all about the shadows, blending noir with Gothic to create atmospheric paranoia. Satanism in Greenwich Village, suicide, psychological discord and urban dread, all potent little threads dangled into the slow burn pot. But ultimately it's the mood of the picture that gets you, unease and the murky mystery ensuring you are hooked throughout. 7.5/10"
10,The Seventh Victim,8,30 August 2006,"Nice movie, shame about the script","This is sometimes cited as Lewton's best movie. It has some of his best scenes and is his darkest and most despairing work. It is undoubtedly haunting, but exemplifies his one slight weakness: his poor story sense. He doesn't always tell a story coherently and doesn't always tell a coherent story.I appreciate that scenes have been cut and that the screenplay makes slightly more sense than the movie, but it is still poorly constructed and needed a complete re-write to realise its full potential. There are a number of problems.Firstly, whose story is this supposed to be? Initially there is no doubt. It is Mary's story.It starts with her trying to trace her missing sister, Jacqueline. We follow her from school to New York. She meets her sister's business parter, whose assistant directs Mary to a restaurant where Jacqueline has been seen. Mary goes there and learns that Jacqueline took a room but has never lived in it. She enters the room and sees the noose. She goes to the missing persons bureau, where she is accosted by a private detective, August, who offers to help. She declines, but his suggestions lead her to check the morgue. There she learns that Gregory Ward has already asked after Jacqueline. This leads her to his office and their first meeting. Next, August turns up again and takes Mary to the perfume factory, where he is killed. She runs off but sees August's body being carried away on a subway train.At this point we have followed Mary for about twenty five minutes and the movie has been told almost entirely from her viewpoint. We only know what she knows. However, we then cut to Louis Judd in Ward's office who says that Jacqueline is alive and under his protection. The perspective has abruptly changed and for the first time the audience is getting ahead of Mary.Mary has a couple more important scenes but has less and less to do as the investigation proceeds. Increasingly, the detective work is done by the men. It is almost like a relay race: Mary passes the baton to Ward, who passes it to Jason Hoag, who passes it to Judd. Mary becomes ever more marginal to her own story.Later the perspective abruptly switches again - from the pursuers to the cultists and we suddenly have a scene in which none of the protagonists is present and the audience gets information that they do not have. The baton has been passed again. Finally, when Jacqueline has been reunited with her sister, she takes over the story and the perspective switches to that of a character to whom we have only just been introduced.These transitions are so ill-prepared that the movie just doesn't seem to flow properly. This is exacerbated by a related problem. Individual scenes do not follow through on what has gone before and the dialogue (frequently good) often misses the point. For example, why does Ward not immediately tell Mary he and Jacqueline are married. There is no plot reason for this. Why do they talk so little about Jacqueline? Why doesn't Mary ask any of the obvious questions? Again, after Mary has witnessed the death of August, why does she not immediately go to the police? This has changed everything. It is no longer a matter of tracing a missing person - it is murder. But no-one reacts as if there is now a real threat if they continue with their investigations.Part of the problem is that Lewton is so afraid of of cliché that important points are barely hinted at. Hoag and Ward are both in love with Mary, but the movie is so reticent that this never registers and we would scarcely have guessed it without being told. This doesn't need dialogue; a simple look would have done, but everyone is so subdued that there is little for the audience to pick up on. Similarly, the cultists are treated so discreetly that we see nothing about them that might have attracted a sensation-seeker like Jacqueline or that might remotely justify her having to die.I also feel that the screenplay is cluttered with surplus characters. Do we really need three private detectives? Couldn't the characters of Judd and Hoag have been combined in some way? What is the point of Hoag? Overall, there are seven different characters searching for Jacqueline (not to mention the cultists).The flow of the story is also disrupted by the two big scare scenes that seem to have been inserted simply to allow the movie to be marketed as a horror/thriller. The death of August comes too early in the story and creates problems of plausibility thereafter. The stalking of Jacqueline seems to be there only because these 'walk in the dark' scenes had become a trademark of the RKO horror film. In context it makes no sense. She refuses to commit suicide, runs away from her assassin, meets Mimi and decides to commit suicide after all.Finally, what the hell has been going on in Jacqueline's life? When did she go missing? Where has she been all the time? How many times did the cultists capture her? It is pointless going on. The screenplay is a hopeless muddle.This is frustrating because a re-write could have fixed these problems and there is more than enough in the movie to show it could easily have been the masterpiece that some already think it is."
11,The Seventh Victim,9,30 May 2000,Seven is a Lonely Number,"A bleakly beautiful film set in an impossibly lonely Manhattan. It looks uncannily like an Edward Hopper painting translated to film. And it's look is timeless rather than dated. Another incredible Val Lewton film, and an amazing poetic achievement for a B-movie."
12,The Seventh Victim,,28 November 2001,"spooky subways, showers, satanists.....","THE SEVENTH VICTIM is one of the best films produced by Val Lewton, famous for his wartime series of low budgeted, but brillantly spooky thrillers. A young girl (Kim Hunter) tries to locate her missing sister in Manhattan. In doing so, she uncovers a witch coven.  There are so many masterful moments in this classic.  In one scene, she is stalked by top-hatted cultists in a deserted subway, in another scene, as she showers, a female cultist confronts her (Shades of PSYCHO?) and there are terrific shocks as an exiled cultist tries to escape the coven.  A must for horror fans!"
13,The Seventh Victim,7,14 May 2016,Have a drink,"Schoolgirl Kim Hunter (Mary) is called to the office of the Headmistress Ottola Nesmith and told that she can no longer stay on as a pupil as her sister Jean Brooks (Jacqueline) has stopped paying her fees. More than that, Brooks seems to have gone missing. So, Hunter goes off to find her. But Brooks isn't so easy to locate.This film leaves you with scenes stuck in your mind, so it's good from that perspective. It is also well shot with an eerie atmosphere. Scenes that stand out include the sequence with Hunter and a detective exploring an office at night and the subsequent spooky train ride, a shower scene that will make you think of ""Psycho"" (1960) and pretty much every scene with Brooks. Fancy a drink?  no thanks but the pressure is on. And how about that ending? Wow, pretty bleak stuff. Especially coming after what had me cringing as we watched God and the Bible being used as a tool to counter Satan and his ways in an extremely simplistic way.Amo, Amas, Amat, Amamus, Amatis, Amant  remember your Latin from school? The 'ablative absolute' and the 'ut' clause (use the subjunctive). Quamquam. This film also throws in some Latin and I'm glad to hear it. It takes the viewer back to a time sadly long gone as we hear schoolgirls reciting the verb 'Amo'  to love. The day will come when a generation will watch this film and not understand what language it is.The cast are OK with Jean Brooks standing out. Her look suggests she is leader of the occult movement rather than a victim of it. And all of her scenes are quality  some genuinely scary, and all unworldly because of her appearance. That ending with the neighbour comes as a shock and leaves an eerie memory that will have you thinking about how we view life. It's an interesting filmand sad."
14,The Seventh Victim,6,22 October 2008,"""One can take either staircase. I prefer the left: the sinister side""","'The Seventh Victim (1943)' was produced by Val Lewton, who developed a string of well-respected horror pictures for RKO between 1942 and 1946, this particular title being the first that I've seen. Had I been judging the film based only on its visuals, my appraisal would be decidedly glowing. Nicholas Musuraca much surely have been among the most proficient cinematographers of the 1940s, a master of the shadowy film noir, as his wonderful work in 'The Stranger on the Third Floor (1940)' and 'Out of the Past (1947)' can attest. In this twisted thriller, every city alleyway is a looming blanket of darkness, from which scarred, sinister faces emerge to exact their revenge on our helpless heroine. The photography is so meticulously and deliberately staged that the overall mood is not one of realism, but more closely resembles the theatre; it's all so impeccably-stylised that one can't help but be drawn into director Mark Robson's shady world of mystery, murder and deceit  and how about that shower scene!But, alas, for every time Musuraca's superb cinematography managed to draw me into the film, I was jarringly yanked backwards by a ridiculous plot twist, a laughable line of dialogue or a dubious piece of acting. First-rate production values are used to complement a plot that would hardly suffice a B-movie, and so it's an unfortunate waste of talent. The screenplay, by DeWitt Bodeen and Charles O'Neal, seems so preoccupied with approaching taboo material that it flits around in circles, unable to settle on any solid theme or idea. The villains of the picture are ostensibly a secret society of Satan-worshippers  whose duties, it seems, fail to stretch beyond discussions of their secret society, and certainly don't appear to include anything even close to devil-worship. If their weekly meetings merely consist of rich people lounging around and drinking wine, then I'm not sure that the society's secrecy is really worth killing for (and, indeed, the members are such ordinary folk that they can't bear to kill anyone, in any case).You can usually expect the acting in such low-budget horror films to be atrocious at best, but here the cast is quite adequate. Kim Hunter, as a young and vulnerable woman searching for her missing sister, seems out-of-her-depth, not just character-wise, but also as an actress. This being her first film role (in a long and prolific career), Hunter is simply following the script, unwilling to invest any extra emotion into her dialogue. Jean Brooks, after a tremendous build-up of Harry Lime proportions, fails to fulfill the screenplay's bloated expectations; she's hardly the most beautiful woman who ever lived, as described, and even her younger sister has a prettier face. The men  Tom Conway, Erford Gage and Hugh Beaumont  are sufficient to carry along the story. Before you get the impression that I disliked 'The Seventh Victim,' I'll add that its B-movie status allowed it to get away with some nice plot twists, and the abrupt, cunningly-understated ending  the sound of a chair collapsing in another room  was a stroke of genius."
15,The Seventh Victim,10,13 December 2007,"Dreary, Atmospheric, Nihilistic - Ahead of Its Time.","""The Seventh Victim"" follows Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter, who would later win an Oscar for her performance in ""A Streetcar Name Desire"" with Marlon Brando), a naive and kind orphaned young woman who receives notice that her older sister, Jacqueline (Jean Brooks) has vanished. In a search for her missing sister, Mary heads to Manhattan where Jacqueline was last seen. But during her investigation, she winds up witnessing a murder and uncovers some dark secrets about her sister- like the Satan-worshipping cult that she belonged to, which may have something to do with her random disappearance. As time begins to race, Mary must find her sister and save her from whatever impending doom awaits her.Truly ahead of its time, ""The Seventh Victim"" is a little-known-of horror film that emerged from RKO Radio Pictures in the 1940s, and was horror filmmaker Val Lewton's first production. What I find surprising about this film is how it still stands as a fairly original story even to this day - over sixty years after it was originally made. Sure, the Satanic-cult scenario has been dealt with again and again, but I think it's safe to say that this was probably one of the first, if not the first film to deal with the subject- and it does so in a fairly unique manner. Surprisingly, the audience is even able to sympathize with the cult members, despite their nihilistic, cold belief system and insistence on a person's suicide to compensate for a 'betrayl' against them, because they seem so human. All the relationships in the film feel genuine, and that is likely part of the script working well as well as the acting.A handful of great scenes stick out from the film, probably the most famous being the chilling scene in the late-night subway ride where Mary witnesses something extremely scary. Also well-noted would be the scare scene in the hallway with Mary and the investigator, as well as the bizarre shower discussion that has been noted for preceding Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". Director Mark Robson makes use of shadows, corners, and dark alleyways- all effective pieces in the old-time urban Manhattan setting. Kim Hunter is extremely likable as Mary, and Jean Brooks is stunning as her mysterious missing sister, Jacqueline. Tom Conway is also notable for his performance, which he plays quite well. Now, I do have a few small problems with the script - I felt it needed a bit of touching-up in areas to clarify things a little better, because I had to watch the film twice to catch onto certain elements that I should have noticed in the first viewing. Then again, this movie is notorious for having many cuts made to it, resulting in its modest 71 minute running time. You also have to keep your eye out for the ending too, because the film ends fairly quickly, but its final implications are shuddering.But besides the small script problems, I have no complaints here. ""The Seventh Victim"" is a classic old-time chiller that still holds up well today. While the scare factor may be diminished by time, I still personally found the movie to be scary because of it's bleak and unsettling atmosphere, and it's main subject-- being that of an underground Satanic cult. There's something about this movie that draws you in and doesn't let you go. Well-built characters, sufficiently dark and moody atmosphere, an interesting subject matter (scary, as well), and a handful of spooky scenes make this a classic horror film. If you are a fan of horror films from the golden age, ""The Seventh Victim"" is not one you will want to pass up. 10/10."
16,The Seventh Victim,5,21 February 2006,"'Is That All There Is?""","This was another in the Val Lewton Horror Collection, released in 2005 on a nice 9-film pack DVD set.It's a typical film from the collection. Some stories, of course, are more interesting than others (""The Body Snatchers"" was, I thought, by far the best) but this one - supposedly ""Lewton's masterpiece,"" according to one national critic - I found was generally typical of the rest.""Typical"" for the following reasons:1 - Great cinematography, film-noir-like with dramatic light and shadows, super black-and-white images that are a treat to see. The DVDs offer very good transfers with clear screens and fairly sharp images.2 - Generally-speaking, not much happens in these films, such as this one. In this film, there was one quick ""action"" scene but nothing was shown. The rest of the film is all talk, talk and more talk...but great anticipation that something is going to happen....but it never does. The ending to this particularly movie, and some of the others, was flat and very disappointing. You are left asking, as Peggy Lee sang in her famous song years ago: ""Is that all there is?""3 - Decent acting and suspense...but see above for the end result. Of note, regarding the acting, this Lewton film has Kim Hunter making her debut. It also had a bunch of familiar faces from the 1940s and 1950s but no big names, unless you count ""Ward Cleaver"" from the ""Leave It To Beaver"" TV series. Ironically, his character name in this film is ""Mr. Ward."""
17,The Seventh Victim,5,7 July 2006,Some Thrilling Casting But The Movie Doesn't Make Sense,"I know. I know: Val Lewton saved RKO. He took awful titles forced on him and made subtle movies from them. He was influential. Etc., etc.Nevertheless, and though I do understand that scenes were cut, ""The Seventh Victim"" doesn't follow any logical plot. We begin with a Sonnet from John Donne and hear schoolgirls declining the Latin word verb ""love."" It's filled with literary touches like these.The thing is: It doesn't work.That said, the cast is superb. Kim Hunter doesn't need praise from me. Just think ""Stella""! She was also good in a marvelous film noir that used to be shown fairly often and seems to have disappeared. It even has a great title: ""When Strangers Marry."" Tom Conway is good, as are the other men. Jacqueline Brooks, as Hunter's sister, is made up and coiffed in such a bizarre manner we can't take our eyes off her.Mary Newton, the evil woman who has taken over Brooks's beauty salon, is similarly fascinating to look at. She has a rather tough manner. (A pronounced lesbian subtext runs throughout the movie. I'm sure it was not unintentional.) Both these women remind me of Gloria Holden, so mesmerizing as ""Dracula's Daughter."" Also, in a small role, is Feodor Chaliapin Jr, son of one of the greatest singers of the Twentieth Century.In a way, the most intriguing character, for me, is Irving August. For some reason, though the character is pivotal to the plot, the actor playing him is uncredited. His name is Lou Lubin and for all the world he looks as if he stepped right out of a photograph by the great Weegee! So watching this is not a waste of time. But don't expect a coherent plot. For me, the best of Lewton's productions was ""The Ghost Ship."" This one is in the top half of his others, but not too high up."
18,The Seventh Victim,5,2 August 2017,"Messy, Boring and Annoying","The teenager Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter) is summoned by the dean of her private school to come to her office. Mary learns that her tuition is late since her sister Jacqueline Gibson (Jean Brooks), who is an industrialist of cosmetics in New York, is missing. Mary decides to travel to New York to seek her sister out. In her search for Jacqueline, she meets the lawyer Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont), who married her sister, and the psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway), who seems to know Jacqueline's whereabouts. She discovers that Jacqueline's factory now belongs to her manager and a mysterious private eye offer to look for Jacqueline. Soon Mary learns that her sister joined a secret society that worships the devil that wants to kill her since she has disclosed their existence. What will Mary do?""The Seventh Victim"" is a messy, boring and annoying film of horror genre at least in 1943. The plot is confused and senseless, with silly and ridiculous situations and dialogues. Kim Hunter in the role of a naive teenager is funny. Do not try to watch this film if you are tired; otherwise you will certainly nap. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""A Sétima Vítima"" (""The Seventh Victim"")"
19,The Seventh Victim,5,22 April 2007,Urban creepiness courtesy Val Lewton...,"Odd film from producer Val Lewton, here shaking off his usual island-voodoo gimmickry for a story about sinister doings in New York City. Kim Hunter is sufficient as a young woman searching the city for her missing sister, eventually discovering her sibling was involved with a devil-worshiping cult. Mark Robson directed, and while he's careful setting up this plot he isn't very nimble, and his pacing drags. Hunter isn't a colorful actress--she's not saucy or salty, nor does she crack wise--and getting involved in her plight may prove taxing for some viewers looking for a brash scare-flick. The premise and execution are certainly curious, however the film is simply the precursor to the spate of devil films which followed and is not equal to the best of them. ** from ****"
20,The Seventh Victim,6,18 March 2006,"Interesting, though hardly brilliant","What ""The 7th Victim"" has going for it is its uniqueness. It certainly is unlike any film from that era that I remember seeing.This is one of those films that it helps to know nothing about before viewing. To read any sort of capsule about the flick would definitely take away from the enjoyment of the film.Having said that, I am not totally satisfied with the payoffs the movie provides. There are too many gaps in logic, combined with a bit too much moralizing. Some people find themselves in situations in this film that just simply seem to lack any credibility.For some fascinating sequences (most notably, one that takes place in a shower and seems to have been seen by Alfred Hitchcock) this film is definitely worth a look-see.For me, the individual elements of the film was far more interesting than the sum of its parts."
21,The Seventh Victim,9,8 November 2008,"Creepy, eerie, and genuinely thought-provoking","I've now seen five of Val Lewton's films: ""Cat People"", ""The Curse of the Cat People"", ""I Walked with a Zombie"", ""The Body Snatcher"", and finally ""The Seventh Victim"".One thing that has stood out in all the films is how well the female roles are developed (including the supporting roles in ""The Body Snatcher"", which has more emphasis on the male characters). When these films were made, the women in horror films were often one-dimensional, either serving as a love interest or as a frail character in jeopardy. The women in Lewton's films all have multi-layered personalities; they are thoughtful and mysterious, people we really care about and sympathize with.The main female roles in this film are no exception. The story begins somewhat like ""The Lady Vanishes"", in that a young woman is searching for another woman (in this film, her sister), and she keeps hitting dead ends, all the while feeling like there's something more sinister going on. (The similarities end at this point, but there are definitely elements that seem very much like Hitchcock's earlier films.) The film raises many questions and tackles many issues--the will to live, the will to die, the meaning of love, and what true courage is. If you don't pay close attention, you may not even notice these issues, because the atmosphere and plot development of the film are equally engrossing. The film keeps you guessing, and there are many scenes that are genuinely eerie. When it first came out, I'm sure that the subject matter would have been especially unsettling.""The Seventh Victim"" is difficult to classify. It's probably closest to being a thriller, but there are enough macabre elements to push it toward the horror genre. However you view it, it's a great film. Best viewed alone at night with all the lights out."
22,The Seventh Victim,7,30 October 2007,West Village Palladists,"Atmospheric thriller. Although shot on a Hollywood back lot, it captures the look and feel of the old West Village, a neighborhood of artists, writers, actors, poets, bohemians, eccentrics, shopkeepers, restaurateurs...and devil worshippers? Val Lewton, of course, is the master of creating suspense out of shadows and sounds. There's a disappearing corpse on a subway, a mysterious room with a noose hanging in it, and a great shower scene that anticipates the more famous one in PSYCHO. Unfortunately, the plot is difficult to follow due to several deleted scenes; it would be great if a restored version could be reconstructed.Historical note: In the movie, the devil worshippers are called ""Palladists,"" and several characters read a book describing Palladism. This appears to be a reference to a real book called ""The Devil In The Nineteenth Century ."" The book claims, among many other sensationalistic things, that there was a group of Satanists in South Carolina (!) called the Palladists. The book exists, but its authenticity has been questioned; it appears to be a hoax."
23,The Seventh Victim,7,4 March 2007,"Deliberate, chilling, and atmospheric.","It's hard to imagine how the producer Val Lewton managed to pull off these spooky, understated little films at RKO. The studio, envious of Universal's monster series, kept throwing these ludicrous titles at him. ""The Cat People."" Did ""The Cat People"" make money? Okay, then, ""The CURSE of the Cat People."" If Universal had ""The Wolf Man,"" they threw ""The Leopard Man"" at Lewton. Yet he kept constructing miniature gems on these fragile foundations.This is one of them, from 1943. It won't scare the kids as much as ""The Cat People"" did because there are fewer unexpected shocks (""buses"", Lewton called them). But adults will find it about as interesting as any of Lewton's other fantasies, especially if they're at all familiar with Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"" and are able to connect dots with any facility.Here's the opening, in which the tenor of the film to follow is fully laid out. I'll use it as an example and then pretty much quit.Mary (Kim Hunter, in her first role) is a student at some academy outside New York. Mrs. Lowood, the headmistress, calls her into the office and explains that Mary's sister, Jacqueline, has stopped payments for Mary's tuition without explanation. Mrs. Lowood has been unable to contact Jacqueline. Mary says she intends to go to New York and look into her sister's incommunicado. Mrs. Lowood offers to help pay Mary's tuition and adds that if Mary is unable to find Jacqueline, she is always welcome to return to the school as a teacher.In the hallway, Mary is stopped by a young teacher, Mrs. Gilchrest, who pleads with her not to come back to the school. She herself was once in Mary's position and has regretted her return ever since. At this point we hear Mrs. Lowood's commanding call from inside -- ""Gilchrest?"" Mary leaves the school after a fond look at a grandfather clock in the hallways.From the beginning everything is askew, not what we expect from a cheap B movie, not quite ""normal"". The apparent disappearance of Mary's sister Jacqueline is only the most obvious part of the puzzle. Mrs. Lowood seems to be treating Mary with sympathy, yet her demeanor is strangely ominous, giving us a sense of something going on that we aren't aware of.Gilchrest's anguished warning in the hallway suggests that our unease is justified. I mean -- what the hell HAPPENED to Gilchrest when she came back to the school? Or is she frankly nuts? Lowood's demanding call leads us to believe that Gilchrest knows whereof she speaks. Neither Lowood nor Gilchrest is ever seen in the film again.And the grandfather clock? What's that about? If anything.Some of these apparent dead links may be due to hasty editing, attempts to trim the film down to a B-movie slot in the local theaters. But then why do Lewton's movies leave behind this sense of languorous dread when other, completely forgettable B movies, show plot holes because the actors are rushing through the film so that instead of mysterious digressions we wind up with plot holes? Mary's investigation takes her to Greenwich Village and puts her through a maze with odd characters as guides or red herrings. In the most clearly violent scene one of her acquaintances, a creepy detective, prowls through a dark and deserted building with her. Hearing a noise in the hallway ahead, he steps into the shadows, while Mary waits trembling, and after a few moments staggers back wordlessly with a fatal wound.I think I'll let it go at that. Don't bother watching this if you expect a slasher movie or even a horror movie. Watch it some night when you feel ready to let its sluggish current take you along on a ride through a phantasmagorical setting that is anything but Disneyland."
24,The Seventh Victim,,13 February 2005,"Atmospheric, engaging, creepy and very effective stuff that has aged very well","When Mary Gibson comes to New York to find her missing sister, Jacqueline, she is shocked to discover that she has a brother-in-law she knew nothing about as Jacqueline has gotten married. However she still can't locate her sister. However when she meets Dr Louis Judd, he gives her hope and provides some guidance to her efforts. When her private investigator is killed, Mary later sees his body being carried by two men on a train and suggests to her that something strange may be up; with the help of unemployed poet Jason Hoag she then starts to find connections between Jacqueline's disappearance and some form of strange cult.I had no idea what this film was about but, having been seeing a lot of the Falcon movies recently, I decided to watch it due to Conway's involvement and was pleased to find that was much more than just that to make this film worth seeing. The plot is pretty dark and features a lot of hinted material that I would not have expected to have found in a film made during the 1940's  and is all the better for it. The ""mystery"" of the film is revealed early on and this is not the hook on which we are hung; instead the story unfolds with an intense atmosphere of foreboding that really offers nothing happy for the audience to leave with. The story is still good but, without this atmosphere and creepy touches, it isn't enough to work this well by itself. The material has plenty of creepy moments such as the shower confrontation, the creepy chase through alleyways, the subway confrontation and the ending itself; these are all very effective and are complimented by great direction from Robson and lighting/cinematography to match.The cast could almost seem secondary to this side of the film but they do all still manage to be effective and add to the atmosphere. Hunter is convincing as Mary, innocent, naïve and in great danger, it never feels like a performance. Conway is good because I was never sure what side he was on or if his character was completely honest or not. Meanwhile Brooks works despite being a bit of an early Goth cliché; Gage is effective and the whole cast pretty much matches the atmosphere of the film and add value with their performances.Overall this was a very nice surprise to me. It may be quite short but it is surprisingly effective in terms of having a creepy atmosphere; the story works well and the performances only help the film to produce a 1940's chiller that is surprisingly downbeat and effective throughout."
25,The Seventh Victim,9,9 November 2007,In a word: mind-boggling,"This is by far my favorite Val Lewton's production.How can a film be so disturbing,so scary,without any real special effect,without any hackneyed trick and with a shoestring budget.It's impossible to watch ""the seventh victim"" and not to think of other films yet to come.And what films! ""Psycho"" :the scene when Kim Hunter is having a shower predates that of Leigh by more than fifteen years: the ominous shadow behind the curtain,her threatening words.""Rosemary's baby"" : it's quite possible Ira Levin was influenced by this film when he wrote his book.Both Polanski's movie and ""the seventh victim"" deal with everyday life terror ,there's apparently nothing supernatural,it is a normal world where unusual details occasionally surface.Most amazing thing,all the characters are interesting,not at all the cardboard ones you can meet in 95% of today's fantasy and horror flicks.A poet ,an one-armed woman who plays the piano,a circle of respectable devil worshipers , a woman who seems to have gone nuts,because of them,or because she already had this great fascination for death (this scene when Hunter opens her sister's bedroom door and sees the noose above a chair gives the jitters.) I cannot find a single weak sequence in this movie .It may last only seventy minutes ,its density is extraordinary: the detective's death and the unusually inventive use of the subway;the sister's reappearance ,almost zombie-like;the shower;the worshipers,trying to make their victim commit suicide;the two men setting their faith in Christ and his commandments against the ""what is good? what is evil?"" of the disciples of Satan.But the last sequence is unique: having met a suicidal woman in the stairs ,the sister comes into her room,we catch a glimpse of the sinister scaffold;as the other woman is leaving for the city ,she can hear a sound (a chair?),but she hardly notices it and she comes down the stairs quickly.."
26,The Seventh Victim,4,8 February 2010,The weakest Lewton film,"For a film that tries to be clever. Show satanists as poor misguided creatures and deal with subjects like suicide, it's hard to take it serious. It's not just that the actors (for the most part) doesn't seem capable of showing any feelings. The script is just so poorly put together, introducing characters who just happens to want to help Mary and that sudden love which had no build up what so ever.They meet, share a few words. They are talking about her sister for a little bit while looking sad and suddenly one guy starts pointing out that the guy is in love with her. It doesn't make any sense. Furthermore they feel the need to lecture us with the bible.While trying to be a horror/suspense film, this film doesn't hold up. Mainly because of the characters being little more (if not less than) caricatures. How are we supposed to care about them? The main problem was Kim Hunter who seemed to have the same expression no matter what happened to her. Annoyed the hell out of me. And the film isn't even shot well.The weakest Val Lewton film I have seen yet, though the films he is a part of does seem to share many similarities. Simple kinda brainless stories with some horror elements with some pretty empty characters thrown in. Some of them turned out well, this one didn't."
27,The Seventh Victim,,3 July 2000,See this movie!,"Extraordinary is too meager a word for this stunning but little-known movie. Anyone who knows the films of Val Lewton will want to grab this one for his or her personal library.  Every time you think you've got this film pegged--""Oh, that's what's going to happen!""--you're once again proven wrong.  A particularly intelligent film, moody, atmospheric, with a final five minutes that will leave you wondering why more people don't know about this movie."
28,The Seventh Victim,5,23 December 2007,"Strong on atmosphere, the script seemed hopelessly muddled","Despite not having an especially good script, the movie earns a 5 just because director Robson and producer Lewton did a great job in creating a spooky and tense atmosphere. Unfortunately, the film never delivered--allowing the tension to build but ultimately fizzle due to a very poor script--at least when compared to other Val Lewton films. In fact, when you hear Lewton is involved with a film, you assume it will be a top-notch B film which will make the most of its low budget--this one certainly didn't.The film is essentially about young Kim Hunter leaving her school to look for her missing sister. This was done very poorly, as the sister popped into an early scene for a few seconds, so you KNEW she wasn't dead--taking away much of the mystery. Then, when you discover she isn't involved with an evil devil cult, you are never titillated or scared, as these devil-lovers NEVER do anything to kill anyone!! They ask and beg people to do things, but these super-polite folks never get around to doing anything menacing!! It was almost like making the film THE OMEN and having it written by Pat Boone! Where is the payoff?! Additionally, some story elements simply make no sense at all--such as Hugh Beaumont never mentioning to Hunter when they meet or for some time after that he is married to Hunter's sister! And, when totally out of left field, it is announced that Beaumont is now in love with Hunter!! Where did THIS plot element come from anyway?! And, to top it off, right after he declares his love to Hunter, in a separate part of town, the sister is seen killing herself--thus freeing Hunter and Beaumont to marry! Talk about a contrived script!So overall, the lighting, music and mood were very effective. Too bad there was absolutely no payoff and as a result this is a sub-par Val Lewton film. How, with all its logical errors and a poor payoff in the end, could ANYONE score this film a 10 is beyond me, though several have. This is definitely a case of style over substance."
29,The Seventh Victim,7,11 October 2002,"Weak and poorly written, in my opinion","Truly disappointing, considering how big a Val Lewton fanatic I've become. This is probably the third most famous Lewton film, after The Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie, but I thought it was so far below any of the others that I've seen (also including at this point The Ghost Ship and The Leopard Man) that it is scarcely believable. The story concerns a young Catholic school girl, played by recently deceased actress Kim Hunter, whose tuition has not been paid. Expelled, she travels to New York City to find out why her businesswoman sister hasn't paid it, as she usually does. Apparently she's disappeared, although, when Hunter's not around, her sister's friends seem to know where she is. To me, every aspect of the film seemed utterly muddled. The script was sloppy and rather crappy, the acting was often execrable. The only one who does a decent job is Lewton regular Tom Conway. I was particularly disappointed in Hunter, who was so amazing in three of my very favorite films, Stairway to Heaven (aka A Matter of Life and Death), A Streetcar Named Desire, and, of course (and I'm certainly not being facetious) Planet of the Apes. Of course, this was her debut in the cinema. It just doesn't look here like she knows what the hell she was doing (which I hate to say only a month after her death). I don't understand her character, she seems all over the place. Half of her problem is the script, of course. There are apparently two love interests, but the screenwriter can't decide into whose arms he wants to push her. I'm all for going against the audience's expectations, but we need to, at the very least, get involved with her emotional state so we can understand why she does what she does. Eventually, a lot comes to the characters' attentions about the sister being involved in a Satanic cult and also a murder. The cult might worship Satan, but they are apparently not bloodthirsty; they just want to kill the sister because of her own murderous transgressions. The shock is that these Satan worshipers are normal, small town people. But that's been done better since 1943, Rosemary's Baby being the best example. There were a couple of good scenes within the course of the film. I love how two villains try to disguise a murdered man by pretending they are both drunk and that the dead man between them has passed out. I also loved the shower scene. You're never more vulnerable than when you're naked - unless you're a naked, teenage, Catholic high school girl. The scene has probably been described as a forerunner of Psycho's infamous shower scene a thousand times, but the scene in The Seventh Victim is almost creepier for its lack of violence. Still, most of the film, as I've said, just seemed poor to me. Hopefully I'll see what some have raved about on subsequent viewings, as I have it taped. It's enough of a collector's item that I won't erase it (especially since it's short and wedged between the superior The Leopard Man and The Ghost Ship). 5/10."
30,The Seventh Victim,7,27 February 2009,"Uneven as a whole , but there are some great scenes.","This film is no masterpiece. As a whole it is uneven, mostly with the scenes with Tom Conway and Kim Hunter falling in love. But there ARE some scenes that grab you by the neck and simply demand you to sit on the edge of your seat. The best part is when Jean Brooks is running from the Satanis's hide out. That scene is shot with horror and paranoia, creating one of the most brilliant atmosphere's I have ever encountered.Interesting to note is that the staircase seen at the beginning of the film, is the same staircase in Orson Welles's ""THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS"".There are some great scenes in this film, but as I have said before, it is no masterpiece."
31,The Seventh Victim,3,24 September 2011,I'm sorry.  I just don't see it.,"I rarely review movies here but I've been on another horror bender and one of my all time favorite scary movies is a true classic, The Haunting so I'm definitely not one of the Saw/Hostel set even though this movie came out when my grandparents were young. It appeared as a well regarded movie on many ""Scariest movies ever"" lists as a chilling and atmospheric psychological horror flick. Keep in mind I'm basically reviewing this as such, I really can't fathom how people find this film terrifying, or even the tiniest bit creepy.I basically sat through the movie waiting for the horror, waiting for the atmosphere waiting for SOMETHING interesting to happen and it just didn't. It wasn't without plenty of merits, the acting was fairly good and the cinematography was nice and it had a nice varied cast of characters that are as fleshed out as a character can be compared to most of the trash that calls itself horror these days, but as a horror movie it simply didn't register. The antagonists were revealed in such a dry manner and were simply not imposing whatsoever and the main pitfall our heroine was up against was hardly something that seemed threatening in the slightest.The director missed a golden opportunity to use pacing to give a sense of claustrophobia as the antagonists close in, anything to even lead us to believe the heroine was in any danger whatsoever, a danger that might have been closing in on her throughout the movie. There was nothing though, some events unfold as anticipated and then the film ends.Really, if you're looking for a good horror flick, this isn't it, if you can enjoy a slightly (and i mean VERY slightly) dark classic on just those merits alone, you could do a lot worse then this.This movie isn't creepy, chilling, scary or even horror at all. The best way I could describe it is a slightly noirish drama. Just because there's a satanic cult in the synopsis doesn't make this automatically horror.I just want to warn others who might be looking for an actual horror movie and could be mislead by all the reviews on this."
32,The Seventh Victim,7,12 August 2013,One of the Best Horror Films You Never Heard Of,"A young woman (Kim Hunter) in search of her missing sister (Jean Brooks) uncovers a Satanic cult in New York's Greenwich Village, and finds that they may have something to do with her sibling's random disappearance.Purported homosexual undercurrents run through the film and it has a generally dreadful story without the happiness that should accompany a film of its era. Today's audiences may not fully appreciate the darkness or the subtle sexual messages, but they are there and brilliant.This is one you need to see repeatedly to really get the depth and beauty. Lewton had a unique way to approach horror. He was given titles by the studio and was forced to make movies somehow related to the titles. Well, he did not go for the in-your-face horror. Even here, with a Satanic cult, it is not as obvious as we might see today."
33,The Seventh Victim,,12 October 2002,Unsettling little film noir weakened by abrupt ending...,"If you want to watch an absorbing thriller, strictly 1940s style with the power of suggestion filling in for graphic horror, THE SEVENTH VICTIM will keep you entertained with its story of a naive girl searching for her sister in New York's Greenwich Village, only to find that she is being held captive by a Satanic cult.That's the basic premise and it holds together quite well under Mark Robson's taut direction. But there are weaknesses aside from some unexplained holes in the plot and an abrupt ending that seems to have no link to the plot until you think about what's in store for the woman (Evelyn Brent) who decides to go out and have a good time.Kim Hunter quietly underplays most of her scenes and does a fairly competent job in her screen debut. The menace comes from the players around her and they all turn in convincing performances--particularly Isabel Jewell and Tom Conway.  Not quite the masterpiece I expected after hearing how highly esteemed this picture is among Val Lewton fans. His ""Cat People"" was far more frightening and effective in suggesting the terror. This is compelling at times but the overall effect is a much milder one.The shower scene with Kim Hunter listening to a woman's threatening tone of voice reminds one of PSYCHO. Especially well done is a New York subway scene with two men propping up what is obviously a dead body as Hunter watches with fear and suspicion.A neat little thriller which is probably more complex than it appears on the surface when you stop to think about it."
34,The Seventh Victim,9,22 April 2013,Film buff's seventh heaven,"""The Seventh Victim"" has one of the most unusual endings of any Hollywood film before or since, achieving an unsettling quality despite having been shot on an understated studio set with a flickering light as its only special effect. More intriguing still is the fact that the movie was not even supposed to end at that point. The script includes an extra scene, which would have provided a far more conventional ending.""The Seventh Victim"" is one of Val Lewton's productions made on old sets with limited budgets. However, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting and Roy Webb's moody score gave the film a richer feel. As a number of reviewers have already observed, there was a lot cut out of this film leaving plenty of loose ends, but ""The Seventh Victim"" is still hard to beat for sheer atmosphere and sense of impending doom.When Mary Gibson, played by Kim Hunter, is forced to leave the exclusive girl's school she is attending after her sister Jacqueline disappears and stops sending money, she heads to New York to find her. She learns that Jacqueline has sold her cosmetics company, but has a room above the Dante Restaurant in Greenwich Village. She discovers that the room contains only a chair with a hangman's noose suspended above. The film only gets darker and stranger from this point on.During her search, Mary meets Dr. Judd, the mysterious psychiatrist from ""The Cat People"", played by Tom Conway, and Hugh Beaumont as Gregory Ward, Jacqueline's husband she knew nothing about. By far the strangest character in the story is Mimi, played by Elizabeth Russell. Mimi, who is ill and slowly dying, occupies the room next to Jacqueline's above the Dante Restaurant.Finally the reason for her sister's disappearance is explained. In her quest for fulfilment, Jacqueline, played by Jean Brooks, joined the Palladists, a group of Satanists who now wish her dead for breaking the group's vow of secrecy.On the surface, the Palladists seem respectable, even prosperous, but they believe in the power of evil to bring them rewards in life. Although they profess non-violence, death is the punishment for breaking the strictures of their society. Their method of execution is to coerce the victim into committing suicide. Six have succumbed to this punishment and Jacqueline is to be the seventh victim; there is no escaping her fate.Surprisingly for a film of the 1940's, ""The Seventh Victim"", encompasses not only devil worship, but also has an ending where evil has seemingly triumphed over good. As if that were not enough, suicide is used as the resolution to the central character's difficulties. All these transgressed the production code of the time.Another unusual character in the movie is unsuccessful poet/philosopher, Jason Hoag, who is introduced by other characters as amusing and light-hearted. However his character is as sombre as nearly everyone else, possibly explained by his unrequited love for Mary. Although Erford Gage, the actor who plays Jason Hoag, struggles to make his character in the film totally convincing, the character of the man is in no doubt. During World War Two, many actors who had already appeared in Hollywood films served in the armed forces. Some saw combat, but only a few were killed  Erford Gage was one that was. He enlisted in the U.S. Army and was killed in 1945 during the fighting on Luzon in the Philippines  he was also awarded the Silver Star for gallantry. I think knowing this gives his role added resonance, especially towards the end when he challenges the Palladists with an emotional speech, which is the only concession the film makes towards promoting good over evil.Lewton biographers claim that this film is close to the man's basic tenets and personal philosophies. If so, Lewton must have been a man with baggage, for this is a movie that promises little hope for its protagonists other than resigning oneself to one's fate. ""The Seventh Victim"" lives up to its cult status, and no matter the flaws of individual scenes or the deficiencies of some of the characters, it's a movie impossible to forget."
35,The Seventh Victim,9,12 January 2012,The Seventh Victim (1943),"Director Mark Robson and producer Val Lewton have consistently delivered good noir and good horror respectively, and this film is a fantastic blending of the two. Kim Hunter makes her debut as a young woman searching for her older sister, and stumbling across a strange secret. This is an eerie, creepy film which delights with Gothic atmosphere and chills with its somber messages. I'm not sure if I've seen a Hollywood film from this era, including film noir, with such a dark ending. It's really a stunner. There are some inconsistencies in tonality, especially when characters seem to take things far less seriously than they should. But the boldness of the material, stunning high contrast photography and downright weird scenes help ameliorate the obstacles. I'm tempted to rate this a little higher, but perhaps I'll wait until a future rewatch."
36,The Seventh Victim,10,7 November 2008,B Thriller predicts Rosemary's Baby,"The Seventh Victim is a somewhat overlooked gem from the classic period known as Hollywood's Golden Age or The Studio System or basically referring to a time when movies did not have to compete with television. In those days everyone went to the movies at least once a week. Films were not aimed necessarily at the lowest common denominator as most are now. People who made films actually assumed that the audiences were adult, literate and in most cases willing to sit through scenes that did not focus group very well. The ""Production Code"" was still very much an issue. Blood, gore, sex and swearing were kept to a minimum. Viewers had to interpret often ambiguous comments and double entendre to get the point. The feeling was that if you were to young or naive to get the clue that it's inappropriateness would not harm or offend you in any way.This picture was made by RKO's head of horror production, Val Lewton. Given small budgets and being saddled with idiotic titles (This fares better than the titles for ""Cat People"" and ""I walked with a zombie"") Lewton was able to fashion films that stand up to the test of time. This was one of them. It begins in a fairly straightforward manner as a young woman must leave boarding school to try to find her older sister who seems to have disappeared in the big city of New York. Let it be said that nothing that she encounters is really as it looks and many surprises await her and the viewer.Suffice it to say a lot of the value from this movie is directly linked to how little you know about the actual plot so I will dispense with saying anything that might limit your enjoyment. It is one of the darkest films of the period and any period for that matter but is absolutely knockout entertainment and is not to be missed."
37,The Seventh Victim,8,19 June 2007,Mysterious and Enchanting,"""The Seventh Victim"" is a rare and wonderful find. Gently paced as it is, after just a few minutes I was fairly glued to the screen. The superb and understated acting--no pyrotechnics here, thankfully--and the modest and unassuming production cement the credibility of a slightly weird tale of urban satanists and their prey.The plot is nonetheless frustrating at times, for reasons which other contributors have offered here, and this aspect is explained to some degree by the ""missing scenes"". But the film remains a truly unusual delight.Not least because of the notable civility of every character--not only speaking of a more civilized time, but also forming a pronounced counterpoint to some of the hideous business at hand.Along with at least one other observer here, I'll eat my hat if it's ever demonstrated that Hitchcock didn't see this film. Because, among other things, his famous shower scene seems an homage to a very creepy one here; a good part of it lifted almost directly.Don't even glance at the clock while watching this film, because that gentle pacing will surprise you more than once.Among the film's many visual treats is the setting: a perpetually darkened, old-fashioned, vacant and nearly silent Greenwich Village--not so much of another era as out of one's dreams....or nightmares..."
38,The Seventh Victim,7,29 April 2016,Hail Satan,"The 1940s were an odd time in the annals of horror history. Of course, this has a lot to do with WWII and the fact that people were facing real horrors in their world, but it was a transitional period as well. Universal's golden age was over. While they were still churning out the movies, they were mostly second rate sequels featuring the same monsters over and over. There was really very little else going on in the horror genre. Film noir and the suspense thriller ruled the box offices and it was no surprise, then, that those genres crept their way into the horror film in the works of Val Lewton at RKO, who took the crown away from Universal and carried it into the next decade, starting with classics like CAT PEOPLE and I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE. I have always found my personal opinion of Lewton's movies to be lower than those of the horror community, who tend to worship at his feet. By no means am I going to sit here and tell you that these are not great films, but they are not ""my style"". Further, I would argue that it was Jacques Tourner (as director) who made the early Lewton produced movies so great and once he moved on to other things, RKO was not able to match that early success. But alas, I am getting far too much into my horror geek history lessons and away from the actual movie itself.Our film begins with a young woman who has learned that her sister has disappeared. She leaves school to go to the big city and find her sister. What occurs from there is an odd web of story lines that don't always make a lot of sense. We learn that her sister, Jacqueline, was an odd death-obsessed young woman (goth far before goth was cool). She has just sold her cosmetics empire to her partner. One of the first people that our heroine meets turns out to be her sister's husband. Though married to Jacqueline, he seems to know almost nothing about her personal life, doesn't appear to live with his wife and falls for the young sister in no time, at all. We have poet who hangs around an Italian restaurant. He has stopped writing for a reason that's never truly explains, seems to be the love interest for our heroine, though that story line is cast aside. He joins our other main characters on the quest for a woman he's never met to help some people he just met a few days ago. Now, throw in a psychiatrist, who stopped practicing. He's the only one that knows where Jacqueline is and mainly serves to throw in lines that are supposed to be introspective. We get some odd side characters, as well, such as a private investigator who seems to be here to make one scene work, then disappears just as quickly.Of course, all of this revolves around some devil worshipers. Don't get excited, though. These are not anything close to the cultists you might find in ROSEMARY'S BABY or THE DEVIL RIDES OUT or any of the other late 60s/ early 70s Satanic panic movies. It's basically a bridge club, full of wealthy types, who never actually discuss anything occultist at all, but seem hellbent on preserving their anonymity for some never explained reason.As I'm writing this, I'm actually surprised at the tone that I'm taking because I never intended for this review to bash the movie. In fact, I do enjoy it, but it's occurring to me how silly the plot may be, but that's really beside the point. Like all of the movies produced by Lewton, this movie is all about images, suggestions, fear and shadows. The film carries a pervading fear of death, while at the same time being fascinated by death. Jacqueline (the missing girl) kept a noose in her apartment as a reminder that death was always a step away. An investigator is killed and we learn of many other deaths in the lives of both the occult and our main characters. Death, almost, becomes a character in itself, lurking over the shoulders of everyone involved. None of Lewton's movies were ever really about monsters, or horrors presented cheaply for the audience. Settings and scenarios were created where the audience implanted the horror in their own minds. Some would tell you that this is the best sort of horror. I see this as one of the first examples of something audiences had never even really heard of in 1943, the psychological horror film. This is a movie that's not about monsters in the shadows, or blood on the killer's hand, but about the horrors that lie inside each of our heads and our own innate fears of death."
39,The Seventh Victim,7,2 May 2015,A Subtly Horrifying Fright-Fest,"Horror fanatics discuss Val Lewton like he's a sort of shadow obsessed God. The producer of low-budget, WWII era horror films renowned for their innovative use of lighting to create a supernaturally spooky tone, projects like Cat People and The Leopard Man aren't lumped together with the schlocky frankness of Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman or The Mummy. They're held in a sort of shimmering prestige: Martin Scorsese considers the Lewton produced Isle of the Dead to be the 11th scariest horror movie of all time; Leonard Maltin believes I Walked with a Zombie is an exceptional forage into B-movie terror. But maybe I'm harder to please than most.I prefer coffee-stained cinematography to slimy gore when it comes to the genre, but no matter how I look at it, I consider the films of Lewton to be ingeniously shot, but not much more than that. Sure, there is a building dread that causes our adrenaline to genuinely pump (especially in comparison to other chillers of the time), but I've never been truly frightened by one of his films; many act as though they're as disturbing as the untamed throes of modern horror. With the exception of the excellent Cat People, they are well-made, if forgettable, B-movies. Maybe I'm just not as much of a Lewton aficionado as I'd like to be.This shouldn't suggest that his films are bad; they're anything but. For the 1940s, they're more stylistically daring than anything in the decade. They rely solely on their photography and ghostly atmosphere, a dangerous move during a time where most studio heads would have an easier time pasting Frankenstein makeup onto the latest macabre personality. The Seventh Victim, which is probably Lewton's second best film after Cat People, goes into the darkest territory of all his films combined. This time, island roaming zombies or lady panthers are not the villains. Satan worshippers are. The climax is not a seismic relief but a distressing suicide, an ending unthinkable when happy endings were at their historic peak. The Seventh Victim takes risk after risk after risk after risk, a series of dares that should pay off. But with its low production value and upsettingly short running time (a mere 71 minutes), things feel cluttered. There isn't quite enough room to develop the story into something earthshakingly haunting; the plot twist comes by so quickly that it doesn't hit us with nearly as much fury as it might have liked to. But if it were produced by anyone other than Lewton, it certainly wouldn't have the staying power it so proudly boasts. With its nightmarishly inky corridors and ingeniously characterized villains, it leaves a frightening taste in our mouth when the story offs itself before anything too stimulating happens.Kim Hunter portrays Mary, a naive young woman who is getting her education at Miss Highcliff's boarding school. Before the film even has time to explain itself, Mary is called into her headmistresses office. It seems that Jacqueline (Jean Brooks), Mary's older sister and only relative, has not paid for her tuition in months. Facing financial hardship, the school offers Mary a choice; she can either stay by working as a student aid, or she can find a different place to learn.Mary, wary of the school's clingy ways, decides to take on the real world. She figures she'll find Jacqueline in a short amount of time, and, with enough education on her side, will be able to find work for herself. But after just a few days of searching, Mary begins to realize that Jacqueline isn't simply on a vacation or something charming like that. She is involved in something hideous, something unspeakable; and after committing a crime, she may have to pay for it with her life.For a film with satanists as its antagonists, The Seventh Victim is a surprisingly mature movie, where the foes are not fire-breathing devils but rather people you could pass by on the street without even noticing something strange. As Mary descends into a progressively alarming situation, we can't help but be even more frightened than she is; she believes that she's going to reunite with her sister in harmony, but we know that something much more evil is circling around her whereabouts. In a way, this is the most unsettling thing about the film. Because we know so much and because Mary knows so little, we instinctively want to protect her. But like her sister, we know that we're much too far in over our head to make any major changes.The story may not stick with you, but its images will. In her brief appearance, Jean Brooks, covered in thick furs and surrounded by an onyx mane, makes a statement, looking like an apotheosis of the crossroads between good and evil. The infamous shower scene, an obvious precursor to the carnage of Psycho, has a blink-and-you'll miss it allusion that only enhances the indirect jolts of the film. Cat People, along with The Seventh Victim are the best films to come out of the Lewton cannon; shame about the overrated others."
40,The Seventh Victim,4,16 August 2014,The Seventh Victim,"The debut film from director Mark Robson (Earthquake), I found this in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was curious to see it only rated two out of five stars by critics, but I soldiered on anyway. Basically at Miss Highcliff's boarding school in upstate New York, young Mary Gibson (introducing Kim Hunter) is informed that her sister Jacqueline (Jean Brooks), her only relative, is missing and has not paid her tuition for six months, Mary can only stay on if she pays the tuition by working for them. Instead Mary leaves the school and returns to New York City to find her sister, she finds out Jacqueline sold her cosmetics business eight months ago, her sister's rented apartment is empty, with only a chair and a noose hanging from the ceiling, this makes Mary much more anxious and determined to find Jacqueline. In her investigation Mary is lead to Jacqueline's secret husband Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont), failed poet Jason Hoag (Erford Gage), and mysterious psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway) who was treating Jacqueline as her patient for depression, routed from her membership in the Palladists, a Satanic cult who she was seduced into joining by her former co-workers. Private eye detective Irving August (Lou Lubin) is enlisted to help the investigation, but he murdered by stabbing under mysterious circumstances, but Dr. Judd helps Mary find her sister, but Ward has found himself falling in love with Mary, Jacqueline was hiding from the cult. But members of the cult find and kidnap Jacqueline, and she is condemned to death, a rule of the cult is that anyone who reveals the cult exists must die, she would be the seventh person to die under this rule, hence the film title, but they have rules against violence, and she is already suicidal, so they tell her she should kill herself. Jacqueline refuses to kill herself, so the Palladists allow her to leave, but she is followed by an assassin, she manages to avoid him and returns to Mary's apartment, next to her own, she briefly encounters her young terminally ill neighbour Mimi (Elizabeth Russell), she is afraid to die but plans a last night out on the town. While Mary and Ward find affection for each other during their time together, in the end Jacqueline goes back to her own apartment and hangs herself, the chair thudding after falling is heard, but the sick woman does not recognise the sound as she leaves. Also starring Isabel Jewell as Frances Fallon, Evelyn Brent as Natalie Cortez and Ben Bard as Mr. Brun. In her first leading role Hunter proves an upcoming talent, she indeed out performs co-stars Conway and Beaumont screaming on cue and looking constantly nervous, three years later she was cast in A Matter of Life and Death, then she won an Oscar for A Streetcar Named Desire, and then came three Planet of the Apes films, pretty good considering. As for the film itself, this does feel creepy and atmospheric, the best sequences being with the cult members being forceful and sadistic towards their victims, but the script is rather underwritten, full of some clichés, and there are just better horror films. Okay!"
41,The Seventh Victim,7,5 June 2014,"Missing the motivations, these Satan worshipers take over the place of Nazi's.","Living a secret life on the lower East Side, a group of devil worshipers seem to be an analogy for fifth columnists playing the spying game in New York in this combination of psychological horror and film noir. Broadway actress Kim Hunter made her film debut as the sweet younger sister of a missing woman. She drops out of college to head to New York to find her missing sister and stumbles upon something far more sinister than she could ever imagine.The dark shadows of the New York streets take front and center in this intriguing thriller that makes the night a villain and its characters simply players in a game of chess where both the winner and loser's grand prize is the same: death, where the fate is certainly worse. These streets are filled with odd noises, scary images and even today, when you venture down certain avenues in Manhattan, you may feel the same chills that the heroines here certainly felt, 70 years ago.The odd hairstyle of the missing sister (Phyllis Brooks) is pure Val Lewton with its severity even though the character is not meant to be evil, just mysterious. She appears almost death-like, a combination of ""Dracula's Daughter"" and ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" as she first appears to put her finger up to her lips to ""shhh"" her sister in their first scene together as her presence is definitely meant as a metaphor. Death definitely does not take a holiday here, and the most evil that the devil worshipers get is to prod their intended victims onto suicide, making their meeting place feel like a room of ""Rebecca's"" Mrs. Danvers.The direction is appropriately grim and slow moving, giving it almost a feeling of floatation, with a scene in a shower that obviously influenced Hitchcock decades later. As imperfect as this film is, it is one that won't leave your mind, and one you will re-visit to try and find the many hidden metaphors and themes which its creators intended."
42,The Seventh Victim,7,31 May 2010,One of Lewton's best,"The Seventh Victim is a chilling b-horror picture with some great style that recalls other great moments in fright cinema. There is a fantastic moment that recalls the dreamlike quality of the twist in Laura, a tense pre-Psycho shower scene, and a vague essence of the menace underneath appearances from Rosemary's Baby. While these similarities make the film fun for cinephiles, it is not the most compelling aspect of the film. DP Nicholas Musuraca makes forbidding use of shadows and dark allies and hallways. The script incorporates too much (a love-angle, a mystery-angle, a psychological horror-angle, the obligatory morality-angle) but the haunting lighting and atmosphere, as well as Jean Brooks' noteworthy performance as a woman pushed to the edge of her control, keep you glued through to the dark but satisfying ending."
43,The Seventh Victim,8,8 February 2005,A lovely little chiller from Val Lewton,"Val Lewton made a name for himself within the horror genre by producing atmospheric chillers, and The Seventh Victim is one of the best of them. Although not as great as the likes of Cat People and The Body Snatcher, The Seventh Victim represents another successful fusion of intriguing mystery and atmospheric chiller. The plot revolves around a girl in a boarding school whose sister has gone missing. Upon travelling to New York in an attempt to find her, she learns all kinds of things about her sibling and the mystery increases until we eventually learn the truth about her disappearance. Like most of Lewton's films, this film is very short at just seventy minutes long but it certainly makes the most of it's running time as included in that seventy minutes is a compelling and entertaining mystery that gives many similar films that are on release today more than a run for their money. Nowadays films seem to want to be as long as they can possibly be, but a story can be adequately told with a lesser running time - and this movie proves it.The acting in the film ranges from good to not so good, with Kim Hunter being at the top end of the scale with a great debut performance, and Hugh Beaumont being at the other end with a not so great performance. It's far too over the top and gives the film a rather silly edge. However, there's a role for Lewton regular Tom Conway who plays the same character that he played in Cat People. The atmosphere in the film isn't as great as it was in The Body Snatcher or the Jacques Tourneur collaborations, but Mark Robson does a decent job with it, and the audience is always on the edge of their seats and believing that something bad is about to happen. My only taste of him before this film was his later collaboration with Lewton (and Boris Karloff), 'Isle of the Dead' and I was somewhat less than impressed so it's good to see that he didn't squander this film as well. One bad thing about this film, however, is the ending. It feels rushed and almost like it was tacked on at the last minute. It doesn't ruin it, but a more complete ending would have made this the classic it could have been."
44,The Seventh Victim,7,25 April 2009,Has some hints of a great movie in it but overall it's mostly average.,"In a way this movie has some wasted potential in it. It's not like this is an horrible movie to watch but with such a fine original concept (for its time), the movie truly could had been a much better- and way more fascinating one.The movie now doesn't always work out due to its writing, that isn't always convincing, even though it still at all times remains a good perfectly and watchable movie. It's concept already provide the movie with a certain dark and moody atmosphere, which gets strengthened by its real fine and effective cinematography, that seems just perfect for this type of movie with its mystery and thriller elements, that mostly rely on the movie its atmosphere.I also surprisingly much liked the musical score for the movie. Roy Webb isn't that well known as most other composers from the same era but he truly made some great stuff throughout his career and also worked with some big name directors like Jacques Tourneur, Robert Wise and Alfred Hithcock.It's a bit of a too old fashioned movie, in the way it got made. You can blame the inexperienced director Mark Robson for this, who with this movie made his directorial debut. He directed this movie like an '30's movie, while this movie itself got made in 1943. I haven't seen that many movies directed by him but his movie always seem to be minimalistic ones. He could make and tell a story with limited resources and without too much happening in the actual movie itself. This was a quality by him that often provided his movies with some strong and memorable sequences but at the same time also kept all of his movies on the level of being average ones, or ones slightly above that.The movie would had perhaps also been a better one with some better actors in it. Kim Hunter, who made her movie debut with this movie, was only in her early 20's at the time, plays the real main character of the movie but her character just never really becomes you care about, fore her character constantly looks scared and shy. Sure, the movie still has Tom Conway but not as much as his billing might suggest.All in all it still remains a good and moody movie to watch and it has some moments of greatness in it but overall the movie as a whole doesn't reach the level of true greatness, due to its writing and old fashioned way of directing style, which was a bit too distracting all.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
45,The Seventh Victim,6,26 March 2008,Creeps You Out,"This Val Lewton production from RKO could have been a whole lot better, it seems to have been butchered by bad editing. Still and all with some gaping plot holes it's a very effective thriller and is guaranteed to creep you out on viewing.Young Kim Hunter (and her billing here is 'introducing Kim Hunter) gets the bad news that her tuition is owing at an exclusive girl's school. Her sister who is her legal guardian seems to have up and vanished from sight. Kim leaves the school to investigate.When Lou Lubin the private detective she hires is also killed, things start to get real hairy. For most of the film and it's the most effective part of the film, Hunter hasn't a clue who to trust here. Neither does the audience and that's what makes it work at all.As it turns out sister Jean Brooks has fallen in with a cult of Satanic worshipers. Just who's part of the group and who's not is not easy to spot. Hugh Beaumont is in the cast playing a part far different than Ward Cleaver. He plays the brother-in-law Hunter never knew she had. Tom Conway plays a most mysterious psychiatrist and well. There's a shower scene with Kim Hunter and one of the bigwigs in the cult that anticipates what Alfred Hitchcock did in Psycho with far less gruesome results. Maybe one day we'll get a director's cut of The Seventh Victim and I can give the higher rating it probably deserves."
46,The Seventh Victim,8,1 April 2007,Wow!,"I've only seen a handful of Val Lewton films and I have to say that THE SEVENTH VICTIM is an amazing little film. Made in 1943, THE SEVENTH VICTIM is one of the ""Noirest"" films I've ever seen. It's Noir on Noir. The actors are good. The dialogue is much better than in CAT PEOPLE. The cinematography is amazing and the story is fascinating, to say the least. Is it really horror? Yes and no. The film works on many levels, which is usually a sign of how good a movie is. It can be seen as a drama with some subtle horror elements in it. It can be seen as a horror film which relies more on mood than actual violence, gore or horror moments to disturb the audience. And it can also work on a supernatural way, simply because of the dream-like way the story unfolds before our eyes.There are a couple of problems with THE SEVENTH VICTIM. First, its length. It's a very short film (71 minutes). It's not that the film needed more time (the film drags a bit here and there) but that some aspects of the story could have been fleshed out a bit more, certainly about the satanic cult. Another weak aspect of this film is the religious overtones of the story/characters, which was a bit anal. But in the context of the über religious period in which this film was made, I imagine it could have been much worse.The best thing going for it is its structure. The story's structure is almost pure genius, certainly at the end, when the film finally concentrates on Jean Brooks and her nightmarish walk through town while she's being followed by a killer. I loved this part. The beginning of the film was all about Kim Hunter trying to find her missing sister and eventually, the sister (played by an unforgettable Jean Brooks) makes an appearance, the film then switches gear and the film almost completely forgets the young sister. This sudden change creates an amazing effect and heightens the story/structure considerably. The whole film is symbolic and Jean's walk is literally a walk through the shadow of death. I just wished the film had more oomph during that moment, more dramatics, more passion, to elevate the movie to a level of spookiness it much needed to be great, certainly in regards to the brilliant but all too brief climax that was about to happen. And what an ending it is. Talk about bleak. Pure Noir. Was this film really made in 1943 and not the 1970s? With such an ending, THE SEVENTH VICTIM was way ahead of its time. Also, it's hard to believe Mark Robson is the same director that made the dreadful VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. What's also notable about THE SEVENTH VICTIM is how much it reminded me of SUSPIRIA, without the color, blood and goblin score. It's obvious Dario Argento was inspired by this movie when he made SUSPIRIA.THE SEVENTH VICTIM is an excellent film that's a few scenes shy from being a great film. If you're a fan of moody horror films, make sure to check this one out."
47,The Seventh Victim,8,16 October 2006,The darkest of all film noirs?,"What could have been a routine mystery is transformed into something uniquely different. A very young Kim Hunter is quite good as the young woman who comes to New York to look for her missing older sister. She encounters a series of strange characters who all seem to inhabit a world of darkness and secrecy. The atmosphere of this film is an elusive one; not frightening in the usual sense, but a feeling of something slightly off with every person she encounters. The dialogue is cryptic and ambiguous; one is never quite sure about the characters' true feelings or motivations. Some of this is intentional,but there apparently were scenes that ended up being cut that would have made things a little clearer. The one aspect of the film that seems hard to explain is the true nature of the devil worshippers. They seem very polite and restrained for a group that supposedly believes that evil is superior to good, and yet that may be what makes the movie work. The fact that this quiet, intellectual group have no qualms about trying to induce a disloyal member into committing suicide perhaps speaks for itself as to their true nature. The movie is undeniably interesting and absorbing, especially because of the strange , morbid beauty of the mysterious Jacqueline, played by Jean Brooks. A character says of her at one point, "" No one who sees her can forget her"" and that may serve as a summation of The Seventh Victim also."
48,The Seventh Victim,9,22 January 2006,The best of the Lewton horrors,"THE SEVENTH VICTIM is probably the least-known of the nine movies Val Lewton made as head of RKO's b-movie unit, but is probably the most literate. And surely one of the scariest.Not as immediately horrifying as either CAT PEOPLE or I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, this movie contains a couple of the most unsettling scenes in the history of horror films.Let's start with the room that Jacqueline Gibson (Jean Brooks) keeps in a boarding house - you know, the one with the chair and the noose. Surely this must make Brooks one of cinema's greatest, and most memorable, Gothic icons - more on that later.The other genuinely brilliant scene is the one in which the pacifist Satanists (surely these are the most contemptible villains in film history) urge Jacqueline to drink a cup of poison because they don't have the cojones to kill her themselves.THE SEVENTH VICTIM is simply one of the greatest horror films of all. One of those happy occasions in which everything just comes together and the whole truly does transcend sum of the parts.(Here's an anecdote to show just how memorable the image of Jean Brooks as Jacqueline Gibson is - back in the early 1990s, when I was working in London's Camden Town, just before I met my wife, I often passed a woman in the street who wore her black hair in a Bettie Page cut, 1940s style clothes and slightly Gothic makeup. There was something fascinating about this woman, though she wasn't what you'd call beautiful. But I've thought of that woman many times since. Then when I saw THE SEVENTH VICTIM recently, after buying the VAL LEWTON BOX SET, it clicked. That woman was the absolutely image of Jean Brooks in THE SEVENTH VICTIM. It was uncanny. Had she deliberately modelled herself on Jean Brook's image? Who knows? But when the characters in the movie say that Jacqueline Gibson is the sort of woman you wouldn't forget once you'd seen her, they weren't wrong.)Anyway, see THE SEVENTH VICTIM if it shows up on TCM. Or better, just buy the VAL LEWTON BOX SET. We have to support the movie companies when they release classics like this on DVD, if only to convince them to release more ..."
49,The Seventh Victim,10,12 September 2002,Lewton & Company roll a seven...,"Back when storytelling meant TELLING A STORY, Val Lewton and company were weaving tales of terror from the stuff of suggestion. Kim Hunter (whose passing today has come as a shock to the kid in me who fell in love with her as the sympathetic simian surgeon in the first three PLANET OF THE APES films), center stage in her first feature, handles herself like a true veteran; her poise is remarkable, and it's easy to see why Lewton and company picked her. As low key as the rest of Lewton's films, THE SEVENTH VICTIM is also as finely crafted: at no point in the proceedings does one find oneself shifting restlessly in one's seat or daydreaming; superb cinematic storytelling grabs and holds and doesn't let go. I've lost count of the times I've tried to fast forward past this movie to watch the next film on the tape and simply never made it because the craftsmanship stopped me in my tracks. I may NEVER find out what else is on that tape..."
50,The Seventh Victim,9,7 March 2002,A little-known (and shown) suspense gem.,"I saw this film for the first time not too long ago, and am pleased to say it's as good as I hoped it would be. I'd already seen and admired other Lewton productions, and found this to be (along with I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, CAT PEOPLE, and THE BODY SNATCHER) near the top of the class. It has a dark, creepy glory that defies budget and expectation.The Lewton films famously played on psychology rather than explicit shock, and this has several scenes that deserve classic status, most memorably: a detective having to walk down a spectacularly dark hallway, and a woman sitting in a room full of people urging her to commit suicide. These scenes live in the memory long after you see them, and what more can you ask from a movie?"
51,The Seventh Victim,5,30 October 2003,eerie but dumb,"Tale of girl trying to find her sister is stylishly filmed and has some interesting ideas but it's a mess.  One poster in these comments explained how important information was lost in the filming, and perhaps in its full version it would have been more satisfying, but still, reciting the Lord's Prayer to a bunch of satanists while they look sheepish is just plain dumb. The ending is very unsatisfactory.  Still, has its moments."
52,The Seventh Victim,8,17 October 2004,atmospheric Val Lewton production dealing with cults--interesting but flawed,"One of the lesser-known entries from producer Val Lewton, THE SEVENTH VICTIM has many fascinating elements, is well-acted by an interesting cast (including young Kim Hunter, in her screen debut), and creates an eerie and disquieting feeling. The first three-quarters are well-paced and gradually pull the viewer into the nightmare-world of a satanic cult. However, the last quarter is rushed, lacks the careful pacing of the earlier parts, and ends abruptly--and unsatisfyingly. As I had taped this off TCM, I watched the final five minutes three times to make sure I hadn't missed anything. Yes, I know what happens, but it seems a cheat to me. I don't know the production history of the film--there are enough Lewton fans out there who surely do--but it almost seems like an alternate ending was quickly shot after the film was finished. I've heard that important scenes were cut--perhaps someday these could be restored if they still exist and if they were actually shot and not just in the script. Overall, this is a fascinating film and is worth watching, but I think that the majority of viewers will feel unsatisfied and cheated with the last five-to-ten minutes. Perhaps this film will come together with multiple viewings; Tom Conway's character seems quite inconsistent on first viewing. Watch it next time it comes on and make up your own mind. I don't think you'll find it boring!"
53,The Seventh Victim,1,19 October 2013,"Poorly written, badly executed","I have no idea how this film got such a high rating. The whole premise is unfathomable, the acting and the dialog are both stiff and the ""evil devil worshipers"" look like the board of directors of a bank and are about as menacing as a bunch of frumpy old ladies at tea time. What a waste of time watching this drivel.If films like this set the standard for the mindless garbage of the modern horror era I can see we're in trouble. It is truly bad. I don't see how films like this could have ever been produced, I mean, why weren't they smart enough to just pull the plug and start making a good film. I didn't like any aspect of this film, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
54,The Seventh Victim,8,29 October 2006,"THE SEVENTH VICTIM (Mark Robson, 1943) ***1/2","This had been one of the most elusive of Lewton's classic horror films and, in fact, I only first caught up with it a couple of years ago on Italian TV (where it was dubbed, of course). While I recall being very impressed with it then I only rated it a *** and, given that I boosted the rating now, one would naturally assume that I loved it even more; however, the film's low-key nature doesn't make it ideal viewing after a long day's work - but, then, Steve Haberman's excellent Audio Commentary proved quite enlightening (pointing out some of the subtleties I might have missed) so that, by the time I was done with the DVD, I felt that I had 'got' it sufficiently to merit that extra half a star! As with the first three entries (after which a change of director was ordered by RKO - but, then, he had to fight for first-timer Mark Robson!), the film basically revolves around a number of highly-charged and brilliantly-handled suspense sequences: the walk down the dark corridor of the cosmetics shop (the firm is pretentiously named ""La Sagesse"", meaning Wisdom) where an opportunistic but sympathetic pint-sized detective meets his doom; a Hitchcockian scene aboard a train; the shower sequence in which a member of the devil cult bursts in on lead Kim Hunter, warning her not to get involved any further (though entirely different in development, this could well be the cinematic fore-runner of the legendary scene in PSYCHO [1960]!); yet another walk across a dark alley with a threat to one of the characters which could come at any moment and from any corner.The film is undercast, but effectively so: Kim Hunter is impressive in her debut performance; her two suitors, however, are rather too fey - though the poet character is, at least, intriguing (if giving rise to a decidedly over-literate script, already peppered with Lewton's typically pretentious quotations!); Tom Conway actually reprises his role from CAT PEOPLE (1942), making it one of cinema's first examples of a prequel - since his character died in the earlier movie!; Jean Brooks - writer/director Richard Brooks' wife - was a somewhat vapid heroine in THE LEOPARD MAN (1943), but this quality (accentuated by her dark wig, which is every bit as iconic as the one sported by Louise Brooks in PANDORA'S BOX [1928] and must have inspired Uma Thurman's look in Tarantino's would-be seminal PULP FICTION [1994]) actually fitted like a glove her enigmatic and nihilistic character here! Even though the latter does not make an appearance before the 30-minute mark of this 71-minute film - and she only has about 10 minutes of actual screen-time in all! - her presence permeates the entire movie, much like Orson Welles' Harry Lime would in THE THIRD MAN (1949).Though, at first glance, the devil cult may not seem particularly sinister (apart from their leader, Ben Bard) the scene where they finally catch up with Brooks and attempt to induce her to suicide is superbly done; then again, its depiction of Satanists as normal people who lead normal social lives anticipated ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968) by a quarter of a century! The script also manages to sneak in several allusions to lesbianism (which are there for anyone who cares to pick them up); certainly an unusual emphasis for the time. It also features one of the bleakest endings to any film (particularly coming from a Hollywood studio product!), featuring yet another brief but haunting turn from Elizabeth Russell as a dying woman; even though I was aware of how it was all going to end, it still took my breath away (the closing lines - from a sonnet by John Donne - are unforgettable and among the greatest ever, in my opinion)! The Audio Commentary (perhaps the finest in this Box Set) goes into some detail about deleted footage that expanded on the interesting relationship in the film between Conway and the young poet, and also between Conway and a one-armed member of the cult (whose role is severely diminished in the final film!); as a matter of fact, Conway's motives here are even more obscure than in CAT PEOPLE: he's seen as a prominent figure at the parties given by the devil-worshippers, and yet it's because Brooks spilled the beans to him that the latter want her dead (he, meanwhile, seems intent on harboring her despite his cynical veneer)! Haberman also mentions the efforts of British film-makers to watch THE SEVENTH VICTIM in wartime (American films of this era only reached foreign shores after the end of WWII!) - among them the Boulting Brothers, Carol Reed and Michael Powell (the last, according to DVD Savant but which I can well believe, since Kim Hunter was cast in the added subplot for the alternate U.S. version of The Archers' A CANTERBURY TALE [1944]!) - and a hilarious anecdote of scenarist De Witt Bodeen (the script was co-written with Charles O'Neal, father of actor Ryan!) attending a real devil-worship meeting in which harmless-looking old ladies cast terrible spells on Hitler while nonchalantly sipping tea!! The theory of doubles he comes up with is interesting, too, if one I hadn't actually picked on myself; regrettably, however, the Commentary omits biographical data for cast and crew members, which is usually thorough for even the minor characters (as I would have liked to know more, for instance, about the actors who memorably played the ill-fated detective and an old newspaper woman - despite their limited screen-time)."
55,The Seventh Victim,8,25 October 2005,"Cults, Death, Tragedy, and a Minor Val Lewton Classic","Val Lewton (1904-1951) was brought to RKO when that studio decided to compete with Universal in the horror genre. As it happened, RKO was teetering on the verge of bankruptcy at the time--and Lewton was given the audience-tested title CAT PEOPLE and ordered to create an inexpensive movie to fit it. Without the budget to create ""a monster movie,"" Lewton responded with a remarkably artful film that relied on suggestion and implication. He would go on to produce nine such films in all.Released in 1943, THE SEVENTH VICTIM is not quite in the same league with such Lewton films as I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE and THE LEOPARD MAN--but it is astonishing just the same. The story concerns young Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter, in her film debut) who leaves her boarding school to search for her older and strangely missing sister Jacqueline (Jean Brooks)--only to find herself unexpected ensnared by a satanic cult operating in New York's Greenwich Village.Although the story line is a bit choppy, director Mark Robson guides it with a sure hand. Hunter, Brooks, and an exceptional supporting cast including Lewton favorites Tom Conway and Elizabeth Russell give the low-key but effective performances one associates with a Lewton film; the story offers a number of unexpected twists; and the cinematography is the light-and-shadow trademark of a Lewton production at its best.But most disconcerting--and the film's greatest asset--is the cult itself, which consists of people you might have met on any 1943 sidewalk. They are entirely normal, and it would not be until Roman Polanski filmed ROSEMARY'S BABY that another film took a similar approach. The effect is at once disconcerting and remarkably chilling.Unfortunately, THE SEVENTH VICTIM is not widely available at this date. The film is available in a hard-to-find VHS, but Lewton and 1940s horror fans would do well consider the five disk DVD set THE VAL LEWTON HORROR COLLECTION. In either case, the film is strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
56,The Seventh Victim,7,21 October 2005,Cult of Evil,"****SPOILERS**** Being told that her older sister Jacqueline Gibson, Jean Brooks, has gone missing in the big city of New York young Mary, Kim Hunter, leaves her school/dorm in Highcliff and travels to New York's Greenwich Village to find her. At the La Sagesse cosmetic company that Jacqueline was a part owner of Mary is told by Mrs. Rudi ,Mary Norton, the co-owner that Jacqueline sold her share of the company to her and then just got lost. Getting in touch with Jacqueline's attorney Gregory Ward, Hugh Beaumont, Mary is told that he has no idea at all where her sister is and then oddly asks Mary if Jacqueline ever mentioned him to her; it turned out later that Gregory and Jacqueline were secretly married. Getting contacted by this mysterious stranger a local private eye Irving August, Lou Lubin, Mary is told that he can help her find Jacqueline. Mary who at first rebuffs him, she didn't have the $50.00 retainer he wanted from her, she later takes up his offer when he told her he'll work on a pay as you go basis. August does track Jacqueline down in the very La Saesse building that Mary was at the day before and ends up getting stabbed to death for it.Mary running from the building in fear of her life goes into the subway and after riding the rails for what seems like hours sees these two men enter the subway car with what looks like a drunken friend only to realize, to her shock, that he's non other then the dead Irving August. The movie slowly reveals the truth about Jacqueline and what she got into in her stay in New York and why she was marked for death, the seventh victim of a cult who had already murdered six of it's fellow members. Jacqueline had betrayed this Devil Cult, The Paladis, that she was indoctrinated into by not only marrying Gregory Ward, a non-member, but revealing it's existence to her psychiatrist Dr. Louis Judd, Tom Conway, that had him investigate and plan to write a book about it. It was also Irving August's murder that may well have the police suspect her of being a member and thus draw attention towards to secret Devil Cult.Even though the movie has almost no violence at all in it, only Irving August is killed and that happens off screen, director Mark Robson together with film-noir horror master Val Lawton's use of shadows and sounds makes the movie far more horrifying then any special effects, back then in 1943, could have. There's one real chilling scene in ""The Seventh Victim"" where Mary's taking a hot shower and is suddenly and unexpectedly approached by cult member Mrs. Redi on the other side of the shower curtain,something like the shower scene in ""Psycho"", but without any blood and violence. Mrs.Redi, in shadow, looks like as if she's the Devil himself telling Mary in no uncertain terms to quit her search for Jacqueline if she want's nothing bad to happen to her as well as her sister. The ending of ""The Seventh Victim"" is a real shocker not that there's any kind of terror blood and violence in it but that it doesn't follow the storyline that you would have expected back then when the Hayes Commission called for an upbeat ending in depressing and unnerving films like it which I feel, like many others who like the film, is the most effective and shocking scene in it."
57,The Seventh Victim,6,29 January 2005,Dreamlike,"Mary Gibson goes to Manhattan to find her missing sister, while digging up dirt on her whereabouts she gets caught up with some Satanists.A generally creepy and dark undertone is found throughout this film. With shadows and darkness making the sets truly eerie and the deaths were pretty subtle- as they happen off screen.The performances are nothing special by Jean Brooks, Kim Hunter, Tom Conway and Hugh Beaumont, but just right.The story is a pretty intriguing one, involving Satanists though they're not that sinister like I hope they would be and it does seem to lose it's way just after the half-way mark- but then it picks up for the last intriguing 10 minutes, with a very haunting climax.Certain images just seem to stay in your mind, with each scene having something very notable, making the imagery a key factor of the film. The atmosphere and cinematography is just brilliant and along with the score, with these being the standout elements of the film.3/5"
58,The Seventh Victim,6,2 July 2015,story too convoluted but nice dark style,"Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter) is told that her older sister Jacqueline has disappeared. Instead of staying at her school to work, Mary sets off to find her sister. She finds a hangman's noose in Jacqueline's room. Private eye Irving August offers to help but he gets a warning. Then she finds Gregory Ward who was inquiring at the morgue. She joins August on his investigation and he's killed. On the subway, she encounters two men carrying August. The police won't believe her. Psychiatrist Dr. Judd claims to have Jacqueline but she sees her run away. She also finds out that Ward is actually Jacqueline's husband. Poet Jason Hoag offers to help.I love the paranoid darkness that runs through this movie. The shadowy look is great. There are all kinds of murky secrets and dangerous conspiracies. It's young Kim Hunter's first feature. She's a bit stiff and naive which fits the character very well. The story is very convoluted which keeps taking sharp turns with a few too many characters. Mary is overwhelmed and I would be too. It's highly questionable whether the movie makes complete sense. At the very least, there are a lot of coincidences."
59,The Seventh Victim,,8 April 2015,Night and the City,"""The Seventh Victim"" stars Kim Hunter as Mary Gibson, a young woman who embarks upon a quest to find her missing sister. Assisting her are a private detective (Lou Lubin) and her sister's concerned husband (Hugh Beaumont).More sophisticated than was typical of 1940s, low-budget chillers, ""Victim"" watches as Mary stumbles upon a satanic cult. The existence of this cult is revealed in meticulous increments, Mary's ""reality"" slowly revealing itself to be nothing less than devilish; everyone around her seems to be secretly knee-deep in evil.""The Seventh Victim"" was part of a cycle of low-budget horror films by producer Val Lewton. Most of the better films in this cycle were directed by cult-favourite Jacques Tourneur. ""Victim"", however, was helmed by Mark Robson, Tourneur's assistant on a number of pictures. Like his mentor, Robson has a gift for ambiance, his film mixing noir tropes with a weird, bohemian atmosphere, the film's Greenwich Village locales filled with struggling poets, psychiatrists and strange cult members. These cult members are locked in an odd double bind; they're committed to a life of non-violence, but wish to kill in the name of Satan. Robson would revisit these contradictions in 1957's ""Peyton Place"", where sinister currents waft beneath an idyllic New England town.7/10  Worth one viewing."
60,The Seventh Victim,,21 November 2013,A woman tries to locate her missing sister who has vanished under sinister circumstances.,"The Seventh Victim is eerie without being violent or explicit. The film creates a tensely pernicious, balefully enshrouding atmosphere of dread. Relying on the power of allusion, insinuation, and the visual presentation of rich, black mattes, The Seventh Victim's singular story and guileless treatment of verboten subject matter sets it apart from modern movies when compared to current methods of creating horror.When Mary Gibson (Hunter) ventures to Manhattan in search of her missing sister Jacquelin (Brooks), she enters a foreboding world of corruption, poison, mental illness, knife-wielding assassins, murder and suicide. It seems that dear ol' sis stopped paying Mary's tuition, and so Mary, bright and full of hope sets out to determine her whereabouts. But none of Jacquelin's friends have seen her.We see her though. Jacqueline is striking and somber under her jet black hair and sharply planed bangs. Quiet, watchful, morose, her captivating visage thrusts onto the screen like a stiletto with her grave countenance and almost funereal presence.Mary locates and enters her sister's apartment. She finds it unfurnished except for a hangman's noose suspended over a chair. It's not an encouraging development. Worse, Mary discovers that without asking for payment, Jacqueline signed over her successful salon and cosmetic business to a -well, shall we say to an assertive, independent woman with whom she had an evidently rather chummy association. Being made in the 1940's the film declines to further explore the exact nature of that relationship. But is seems there is a locked room at the cosmetics facility and Mary wants to know what's in it.In trying to find out, Mary runs into a couple of private detectives who are looking for Jacqueline too, one of whom issues a warning and one of whom winds up dead. Before you can say, 'speak of the devil,' a shady doctor (Conway) shows up who knows all about Jacquelin, but isn't saying much. He's scared of something. Something unspeakable. And he knows that ""sinister"" means ""left,"" but he sure isn't keeping to the right.In addition to the doctor, there are some mysterious professional types in the area of Jacqueline's last known whereabouts. They all know each other, knew Jacqueline and are aware of something else. But what? They sure are tight lipped. Just what is everyone so afraid to talk about? And why do they all dress to the nines, some of them in black, to meet in a dimly lit apartment late at night? The Seventh Victim is a spooky film noir made with wonderful use of black and white film's deep range of subdued tones. The cinematography creates a veritable study in angular shadows, gritty textures and plush charcoal, chocolate tints. Basement cafes grace the screen with low angle lighting. Street lamps' luminescent oases punctuate a sheet-like viscous velvet of gloom.Distinctive about the The Seventh Victim are it's dark atmosphere, even for a noir, and its refusal to conform to Hays Commission requirements in its frank, unconventional treatment of a variety of morbidly taboo material. An eerie shower scene precedes Robert Bloch's 1959 novel Psycho, and there are some hints at subversive feminism. Even the film score ends on a minor key. All of this is pretty racy for 1943, making The Seventh Victim a unique, precursor to the noir genre.Notes: The character of Dr. Judd appears again in Val Lewton's Cat People. Actress Jean Brooks was thought to be quietly married at one point to Erich von Stroheim. Despite a couple of principle roles, stardom eluded her. Brooks's unique presence was never adequately exploited by Hollywood. The thespian's later years are as enigmatic as some of her characters. Fading into the billowing silver mists of off-screen obscurity, Jean Brooks's after-cinema life is shrouded in mystery and alcoholism. Her premature 1963 death in Costa Rica was overshadowed by the Kennedy assassination, and went unrecorded in Hollywood."
61,The Seventh Victim,6,21 October 2013,Leave it to Satan,"Remember when satanic cults were full of straight-laced middle-aged men and women sitting around in parlors wearing ties and wide brimmed hats? No I don't either, but according to this film that was the modus operandi of a group called The Palladists in Greenwich Village. We've probably never heard about them because they have stricter rules than The Fight Club, if a member talks about the Palladists outside the group their days are numbered. This creepy horror noir is enjoyable and worth a watch. If nothing else to see Hugh Beaumont show off his acting chops before he was typecast as Beaver Cleaver's father Ward. As it turns out, The Palladists was the alleged name of a secret society in France in the 19th century, so this film could claim it was ""based on a true story"" if it wanted to. When one of the members asks for proof that good is better than evil, I for one wasn't convinced by the protagonist's response."
62,The Seventh Victim,7,21 October 2013,Bleak Yet Fascinating.,"Mark Robson directed this bleak yet fascinating horror film that stars Kim Hunter as Mary Gibson, who leaves her private school to search for her older sister Jacqueline(played by Jean Brooks) in New York City, where she meets her husband(played by Hugh Beaumont) who is also concerned about her. Dr. Louis Judd(played by Tom Conway) knows the whereabouts of Jacqueline, who is in hiding from a satanic cult angry with her for breaking the code of silence about their group, and is now hopelessly depressed. Can she be saved from the cult and herself? Eerie and effective film creates a palpable sense of melancholy, with Elizabeth Russell quite good as Mimi, a neighbor of Jacqueline's that is also struggling with depression, but takes a different road... and Dr. Louis Judd returns(?) from ""Cat People"" - though this is not a sequel, more of a one-time further use of the character(who must have survived Irina's attack!)"
63,The Seventh Victim,7,2 June 2008,"Effective, creepy","Effectively creepy black and white 1940's thriller. Kim Hunter and Jean Brooks are perfectly cast as very different yet devoted sisters. Tom Conway is 1940's-style oily smooth and is at his low-key best as the mysterious doctor.A fine old-style story of underground devil-worship, eerie dark shadowy photography, and an unpredictable plot will probably keep you interested from start to finish. When this film begins you have no idea where its going but you want to go along until the end. Many viewers consider offbeat plots to be a detriment, but personally I enjoy an unpredictable path whether thriller like this or any genre. You really don't know what will happen next as you are viewing it. In other words, this movie is not ""formula"" film-making and the results are unique, whether you love it or hate it.A quick frightening knife scene, macabre subway scenes, and the ending of ""The Seventh Victim"" are worthwhile. This is classic film-making technique done effectively."
64,The Seventh Victim,7,3 March 2008,A fine Kim Hunter in an okay Val Lewton-produced eerie programmer,"This Val Lewton-produced programmer is noteworthy for just three things. First, an effective atmosphere of creepy mystery, accentuated by lots of night scenes, dark alleys and shadowy doorways. Second, some effective characterizations by actors who never escaped from B- movie purgatory. Third, and by far the most important, an excellent performance by Kim Hunter in her first movie role. The Seventh Victim is the story of Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter), a young woman who leaves her school in search of her older sister, Jacqueline (Jean Brooks). Jackie had raised Mary, and now Jackie has disappeared in New York City. She had owned a hair salon but seems to have sold it to her partner, an older woman named Mrs. Redi. Mary talks to Mrs. Redi but gets no information. She tracks down a room Jackie rented above a small Italian restaurant and discovers a noose hanging there. A seedy private investigator says he'll help Mary. After they break into the deserted salon in the middle of the night, all the detective finds is a knife thrust into his stomach. Mary meets a lawyer who lies about his relationship with Jackie, then a psychiatrist who appears to be playing all sides of the problem; then a young poet who finds a new love of writing after meeting Mary. But then Mary learns of a group of people in Greenwich Village who are...yes, devil worshipers. Can things get worse for Mary? Who among the people she's met genuinely want to help her and who might be members of the coven? Is Jackie a member of the coven...is she a murderer...does she love death? Can group hope cause a suicide? Does the quote we read at the beginning of the movie by John Donne -- ""I runne to death, and death meets me as fast, and all my pleasures are like yesterday"" -- apply to Mary or to Jackie? The Seventh Victim works as an okay programmer for the first three-quarters. That's when we've met Mary and join her as she tries to find her sister. The last 15 minutes, however, suddenly veers into Jackie's story. Since we don't really know Jackie all that well, it's hard to get interested in her. The wrap-up, when we're back to Mary, seems hurried. Still, the movie delivers uneasy suspense in three scenes. They all involve Mary and they all depend on Kim Hunter's reactions. There's the night-time entry into the hair salon, the lonely subway ride late at night when Mary discovers a corpse, and the shower scene with a shadowy second person looming behind the curtain. Kim Hunter does an excellent job as Mary. She engages our sympathy as soon as we meet her. Mary's age is never mentioned, but we assume she is about 17 or 18. Hunter's Mary is shy but determined and, in a quiet way, self-assured. At one point Mary and Gregory Ward, a friend of Jackie's, are sitting at a counter in a diner. Gregory has a cup of coffee in front of him and Mary, a glass of milk. ""Drink your milk,"" he tells her. She looks him in the eye. ""I don't like to be ordered to do anything."" ""I'm sorry,"" he says, ""I didn't intend to treat you like a child."" Mary may be young and inexperienced, but she has steel in her backbone. Hunter was an actor of intelligence and skill. She brought believability and sincerity to a role. She's remembered now, if at all, for just three movies: Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death, A Streetcar Named Desire (she won best supporting actress) and Planet of the Apes. Her movie career was effectively shredded in 1950 when she was named as a possible Commie sympathizer and blacklisted. Her ""crime?"" Signing petitions in support of free speech. She went back to Broadway and maintained a solid presence on the stage and in television. ""For a long while I wouldn't talk about it at all,"" she said much later about the blacklisting. ""I do now because there's a whole new generation that doesn't remember. And the more one knows, the more one can see, and not allow history to repeat itself."" As for the other actors, keep an eye out for Tom Conway as Dr. Louis Judd. Conway, like his brother, George Sanders, could give off waves of lazy charm. Conway also seemed to be one of those actors who always gave a patina of possible sleaze to a character. In this movie, he kept me guessing for a long time as to what his motives were."
65,The Seventh Victim,,3 November 2005,S10 Reviews: The 7th Victim (1943),Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter) is a young and naive school girl who upon finding out about her sisters disappearance sets about finding her. It would seem that Mary's sister Jacqueline (Jean Brooks) is leading a very secretive life. She has a husband and is involved with an odd group of people. She also has an apparent suicidal desire that she was seeing a therapist about. But when her sister is sought for murder Mary must find her with the help of Jacqueline's hubby before things go bad.This noir (with a bit of a horror twist) comes to you straight from legendary producer Val Lewton. The photography is stunning as we are lead through Jacqueline's melancholy world. The acting is top-notch. Kim Hunter gives her character Kim such a naive air about her that you totally understand why every man in the flick is tripping over themselves for her affection. The cult angle doesn't pan out as well as it could but it's a minor quibble of such a solid film.S10's review: 4/5 or 8/10
66,The Seventh Victim,6,14 December 2016,Not much plot but tons of atmosphere,"A dark thriller from the popular '40s pairing of director Mark Robson and producer Val Lewton. This relies heavily on atmosphere to unsettle the viewer instead of any visual effects; in fact, there are no special effects at all in this film. There are no monsters, ghouls, ghosts, or spirits. In fact, only two people get killed in the entire thing. Therefore this film might be inaccessible to the latest crazed horror fiend who has been brought up on blood, guts, and more blood. Personally, I found this to be a creepy little low-key thriller.While the Satanic plot may be nothing new, in some ways this film is very different indeed. For instance, the Satanists are depicted as a genteel, tea-drinking group who hate violence, not the typical robed maniacs with huge sacrificial knives. Therefore, the baddies in this film are more chillingly realistic than you might imagine, they could be your fellow workers or neighbours. This was one element of the film I liked. The acting is all above average with the cast giving subtle performances, from a youngish Tom Conway who fits the role of a stern British doctor to a tee through to Isabel Jewell as the surprisingly likable female lead, who gets to be tough and assertive in some scenes, which makes a usual change from the usual role the girl was relegated to in this period - a screaming victim.It's also a plus to have Val Lewton on board, who once again includes much of his own unique visual style. Shadows are used heavily (the very best is made of the black and white) to suggest menace, and it works, making the viewer feeling disquiet and nervous, instead of having in-your-face shock horror, the sort with which we bombarded these days. The strong visual imagery - the horror of the swinging noose - plus the oodles of atmosphere help to lift the plodding plot, which has to be said doesn't really go anywhere. And check out the ending - surprisingly downbeat for the time. THE SEVENTH VICTIM may be difficult to watch for some because it has dated somewhat today, but nonetheless the use of visual artistry is highly effective."
67,The Seventh Victim,9,7 January 2015,The Seventh Victim: a rarely-seen gem,"For a few years in the early 1940s a small, B-feature producer achieved something very unusual within the Hollywood industrial system: a series of personalised films featuring a repertory company of performers, directors, writers and technicians. The producer, a Russian émigré who anglicised his name to Val Lewton, had been kicking around Hollywood for years, initially as a writer and then as a gofer for David Selznick, before RKO gave him an opportunity to produce B movies. These had to be completed in six weeks, produced in the studio lot using existing sets and on a shoestring budget. The first, Cat People, was an enormous success. Thereafter, he was saddled with increasingly crass titles (I Walked with a Zombie, The Leopard Man, Curse of the Cat People) which belied the haunting and melancholic quality of the films themselves. Despite the restrictions, Lewton proved a shrewd operator. Using inexperienced directors with ambition (Mark Robson directed The Seventh Victim and others who owed long future careers to Lewton included Robert Wise and Jacques Tourneur), Lewton was able to create an ensemble of considerable talent, over which he presided with a unifying sensibility unlike that of any other producer, with the possible exception of his former boss, David Selznick. The Seventh Victim was the first of the series not to attract a lurid title and, possibly in consequence, did less well than others. The film defies genre: neither thriller nor horror film but with elements of both, the plot is a quest. Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter) is told by the head teacher of her boarding school that she will have to leave because her sister Jacqueline (Jean Brooks) has stopped paying the fees and disappeared. Mary travels to New York where she makes chilling discoveries about her sister's life. Along the way, Lewton's script provides his trademark moments of shock and black humour (an elegant one-armed woman is asked to play the piano and deal cards) and provides ample evidence of the influence Lewton's work had on his friend, Alfred Hitchcock, and Roman Polanski. At 78 minutes the film is a model of spare story-telling though, inevitably, the strictures of budget, time (filming took only 24 days) and studio control had some impact on performances. These are mitigated by the availability of RKO's house team of designers, director of photography, Nicholas Musuraca and composer, Roy Webb, which lends it a visual and aural richness well beyond its means. The Seventh Victim's uniqueness, however, is that, like the John Donne sonnet with which it opens and closes, it is a meditation on death, quite unlike anything else of its time and place, personified by the beautiful and haunted face of Jean Brooks as she walks the rainy streets of a studio-bound Manhattan. Lewton went on to produce seven more films at RKO in the next three years before a making a series of disastrous career choices that limited his output to only two further films before his death of a heart attack at the age of 46 in 1951. Footnote: Intrigued by his lack of further credits, I recently looked up the career details of one of the actors in The Seventh Victim, Erford Gage, only to discover that he was killed in action on Iwo Jima in 1945, some 18 months after The Seventh Victim was released."
68,The Seventh Victim,6,23 October 2014,Did Not Expect That Ending....,"The Seventh Victim is a nicely shot horror-mystery from RKO. While it's construction is simple, there is a somewhat-complex love pyramid going on, and it has a stylish cult atmosphere.We start off with Mary, as she leaves her girl school existence, in search of her sister- Jacqueline- who has apparently disappeared.She heads into the big city, where she follows a number of leads, with hopes of tracking her sister down. During her search she meets a young poet, a psychiatrist, an old Italian couple, and a few private investigators- one of which has been hired by the husband of Jacqueline, who is secretly in love with Mary.Eventually, with help from one of the PI's (who dies) and the Poet, they manage to track Jacqueline down, as she had been hidden away by the psychiatrist (it is subtly implied they were sleeping together).Jacqueline is, hilariously, goth-as-f*ck. Obsessed with suicide, goth haircut (circa 1940's...impressive!), wears dark furs, shoes and nail polish. Anyways... because she could never find a place to fit in, she inevitably ends up rolling with this secret satanic society that requires a blood oath to join.And they feel that she has broken said oath and must be killed, because she revealed their existence to the shrink (she was probably banging).The poet is secretly in love with Jacqueline, and as such, is working alongside her sister, in order to save her life. But now she's facing accusations of being a murderess, on top of the threats to her life. Though, luckily for her, there are a number of close calls,but she does manage to escape... no thanks to her sister and the poet.Everything with the film goes smoothly, until the final confrontation...during which the whole thing turns into Christian propaganda! I wouldn't be surprised if it originally had a different ending that was considered unacceptable by censors. Basically, the film ends with the notion that the teachings delineated through the Lord's Prayer trump the entire Satanic philosophy and worldview. But this is all summed up in about 3 sentences, so it really comes off as quite humorous...and almost out of place. Totally didn't see that coming.6 out of 10."
69,The Seventh Victim,6,3 June 2014,The Seventh Victim (1943) **1/2,"A very young Kim Hunter (in her very first film role) plays the part of Mary, a school girl who learns that her older sister and provider, Jacqueline, has disappeared. This leads the young Mary to Greenwich Village in New York City, in an attempt to find out what happened to her. Along the way she meets three older men who try to assist her: a lawyer, a psychologist, and a writer. In time she discovers that Jacqueline was a member of a cult of devil worshipers who decided to leave the group and must now pay the price for her betrayal.It's frustrating when beginning a review by trying to assure the reader that you do, in fact, ordinarily appreciate the very type of film you're reviewing, even though you're disappointed by this one. So in this case I will start by saying that I am a fan of Val Lewton's 1940's horror films for RKO, as well as '40s horrors in general. Now that this is out of the way, I'll let you know that I have devoted several viewings to THE SEVENTH VICTIM over the years, and though I always wish I could praise it, it's really too flawed in a number of ways to be considered anything more than an above-average noirish drama, perhaps with a hint of the morbid. The photography, as in all the Lewton thrillers, is foreboding and well done. While this movie was unliked by critics upon its original release, over the decades it has become praised as an early forerunner of future satanic cult horrors such as ROSEMARY'S BABY. As such, I can respect it for paving the way more than I actually feel it was successful in doing it.I suppose Kim Hunter is adequate at best in her early movie role as the naïve student Mary. There is precious little emotion from her throughout, and indeed just about all the other main characters in the film are equally dire in attitude and under-played. The plot is somewhat muddled. For openers, there is no reason for Mary and the lawyer to suddenly tell one another they've fallen in love towards the end, when all they've done is meet briefly, and share some uninvolved words about trying to locate the woman's missing sister. This feels like it was thrown in simply because it was some kind of expected obligation. Then we have much confounding nonsense as follows: the suicidal sister Jacqueline is captured by the self-professed ""non-violent"" cult and brought to their room, and is urged for hours and hours to pick up a glass and drink poison to kill herself for her betrayal, but she keeps resisting ... so they let her go home free (?). And when Jacqueline gets home, what is the first thing she does? Hangs herself anyway! Meanwhile, she has been stalked all the way home (in the classic ""Lewton Walk"" style) by a knife-wielding hit-man who had exited the cult meeting right along with her (I thought they were ""non-violent""?-- and even if they changed their minds, why send her home and have a guy follow her to stab her, instead of knifing her right at the meeting?).Most disappointing of all is the very end where the good guy confronts the harmless ""devil worshipers"" on their own turf. (All this time they have consisted of high class types, sitting around as if at a dinner party, dressed to the nines and drinking wine while chatting, more like a lodge meeting, and not doing anything even remotely satanic). All it takes is for the hero to recite a part of The Lord's Prayer, and then the members bow their heads in shame. Very weak. **1/2 out of ****"
70,The Seventh Victim,8,28 February 2014,A typically solid Val Lewton production.,"It's best not to know too much about the plot before sitting down to watch this interesting and offbeat little film, a nice combination of noir and horror that is written, acted, and directed in style. It's got some marvelously scary and suspenseful moments - especially near the end - and is overall quite the potent meditation on loneliness. It's got a memorable shower sequence that Hitchcock may well have seen and remembered before making ""Psycho"" 17 years later. Lewton and director Mark Robson (this was the first of the five features that Robson directed for Lewton) do a fine job of keeping our innocent heroine, and the viewer, in the dark for a fair amount of the running time, and create a memorably enigmatic character in Jacqueline Gibson.Kim Hunter debuts as Mary Gibson, a schoolgirl who learns that her sister Jacqueline has gone missing. So she travels to Greenwich Village in search of her, meeting various characters along the way, including lawyer Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont), who initially doesn't play it quite straight with her, published poet Jason Hoag (Erford Gage), psychiatrist Louis Judd (Tom Conway), and beauty shop proprietress Mrs. Redi (Mary Newton).""The Seventh Victim"" gets very philosophical, and poignant, in the end, with two opposing sides engaging in a rather civil disagreement. But before we get there, there's a very creepy subway ride about which it's best not to reveal too much. Hunter is appealing in the lead. In addition to those actors mentioned, others lending fine support are Isabel Jewell as Frances and the distinctively featured Lou Lubin as concerned private eye Irving August. Jean Brooks as lost soul Jacqueline is excellent once the focus of the story finally shifts to her.Although this entry in Lewtons' filmography underperformed at the box office compared to hits like ""Cat People"", and wasn't well received at the time, it's very well done and certainly deserving of another look from film fans.Eight out of 10."
71,The Seventh Victim,8,30 April 2008,Noir Thriller......Subtle Classic,"SYNOPSIS: A young orphan in a boarding school leaves to find her older sister, who has mysteriously disappeared.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER: Uncovering the lives of others and the fear in finding things you never expected. A psychological thriller that is very subtle in tone and feel.PROS AND CONS This is one in a series of films produced by Val Lewton for RKO pictures. Lewton's work is supposed to have a hint of terror and fear. I have the entire collection of Lewton's work and this is the first one of the series that I have screened.This is a short film (only 71 minutes) that is full of film noir imagery, with light streaming through Venetian blinds, dark hallways and alleys with long shadows.This is a good example of how entertaining cinema can be without all the bells and whistles that are thrown into films these days. The viewers interest is held by the writing and the imagery. There is a tension and anxiety in this film that is always just beneath the surface and the ending is not predictable until you reach it. And it is a strange ending, to say the least.The actors are all competent in this film and it is fun to watch Hugh Beaumont (Leave It To Beaver's dad) acting in a dark psychological thriller.It is films such as this that makes me lament the current state of cinema in America. Like the ""Maltese Falcon"" and ""Out of the Past"", this film shows a world that was more hip, dark, intriguing, dangerous and exciting, than anything the youth of today could ever imagine."
72,The Seventh Victim,7,23 October 2006,"Great Val Lewton, but not his best!","A young woman has to leave the private school she is attending to go looking for her sister that seems to have disappeared in New York. Trying to locate her by asking around the community, she encounters different characters, some amicable, others less enthusiastic in helping her. When one such person finally decides to give her a hand, she realizes that something is terribly wrong and danger his lurking around.Although, a good movie, it is not Mr. Lewton's best. I have just seen his previous features(Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie and The Leopard Man) which were all directed by Jacques Tourneur, and have found these much more fascinating, but still, it his great to watch. There are less effective lighting effects than the others mentioned, but the plot advances at an interesting pace. Kim Hunter is very good in her starting role, as well is Tom Conway which also appears in Cat People and I Walked With a Zombie.I recommend this film, especially for those interested in Val Lewton's work. I rate this movie 7 out of 10. A must see for Val fans."
73,The Seventh Victim,7,3 September 2006,"""I Runne to Death and Death meets Me as fast""","Stylish, beautifully filmed film noir horror film that leans far more heavily on suggestion than on any actually seen horrors - just what you would expect from a Val Lewton produced film. Kim Hunter plays young Mary Gibson at a boarding school when she learns that no news has come from her only surviving relative and benefactress, her sister Jacqueline, in months. She sets off for New York to see what she can discover and finds her sister entangled in an odd love triangle of sorts and a devil cult. As with any Lewton picture, atmosphere is the most important ingredient in this film. Director Mark Robson does a very credible job tangibly dictating the dictates of Lewton and his formula for RKO horror that started in 1942. Dark streets lit with only small lamps abound. A street chase with lots of shadows ensues. Symbolic, often metaphorical language and visions pervade. While the story is not as cohesive as other Lewton vehicles, the film offers some profound aspects. Does death make a better alternative than life? Does good exist not for its own sake but rather as an opposite to evil? What is the nature of love and happiness and are there any sure things in life? The cast is very good though mostly composed of RKO stock actors. Tom Conway makes his way in yet another Lewtoin picture(again playing a doctor). Conway is as always competent. Hunter makes a fine young heroine in her first major screen role. Hugh Beaumont plays an intriguing character. The end will have some disappointed, but I rather thought it clever and indeed abrupt as well. The Seventh Victim has above all some magnificent atmospheric scenes that define it: the noose hanging above a chair in an empty room, the meeting with Jacqueline and her ""friends"" in the salon as they offer her to quench her thirst, the shadowy chase late at night, and the final scene where the power of suggestion overpowers the touching and fortifying scene between Jacqueline and the woman who lives next door."
74,The Seventh Victim,7,18 February 2005,Very creepy 1940's chiller,"The Seventh victim was another one of these movies I had been trying to get hold of for a while and finally added it to my collection after taping it from BBC2 when they screened it in the early hours recently.A girl leaves her high school to go to New York to search for her missing sister. After arriving, she discovers her sister has a husband and after help from a doctor, she finally tracks her down and is shocked to learn that she is a member of a group of devil worshippers, who are planning to kill her. At the end, she goes into a room where there is a rope... The high school girl falls in love through all of this too.The movie is very creepy throughout and one of the creepiest parts is the New York Subway sequence with an almost deserted train.The cast includes a young Kim Hunter (Planet Of the Apes), Falcon actor Tom Conway, Hugh Beaumont (The Lost Continent, The Mole People) and Jean Brooks.Watching The Seventh Victim is a good way to spend just over an hour one evening. Very creepy.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5."
75,The Seventh Victim,1,18 July 2017,One of the worst movies on planet Earth!,"It is the worst film produced by Val Lewton (the best is 'The Leopard Man', same year, 1943). Nothing in this movie makes sense, nothing is deeply explained, the script seems to have been written by a (retarded) child of 5 years, and all the actors have a terrible performance and without expression. They are like refrigerators trying a dialogue among themselves.The story: a young woman, Kim Hunter, has her missing sister, and a bunch of idiots who come out of nowhere, try to help her. One of them is the missing sister's husband, and suddenly, in the middle of the movie, he falls in love with Hunter (apparently, and for no reason, he loses interest in the missing wife)! The movie has no style, no genre: is not a mystery, it is not terror, it is not noir, it is not drama, in fact, it is difficult to determine the style, perhaps it would be a new definition for 'pure garbage'. The most we can say is that is ridiculous and comical in some scenes: Hunter's missing sister, wears a Cleopatra-style wig, and is part of a group of Satanists (as emotional as a bunch of gathered trees). Inexplicably the 'sister Cleopatra' is a potential suicide (do not ask the reason, the movie does not explain anything; the goal of the director, producer and screenwriter is to make you sleep ).The highlight scene: the group of Satanists gets highly impressed when some characters recite The Lord's Prayer for them!Anyway, you can risk and lose 70 minutes of your life seeing this pigsty, however, remember you will notice that never in your life 70 minutes took so long to pass!"
76,The Seventh Victim,,1 June 2008,Dreaming the City,"Ranks with the best of Lewton's legendary horror cycle. Really creepy urban atmosphere that makes good use of cheapo sets to convey sense of loneliness and despair, as Kim Hunter searches city labyrinths for mysterious sister. The Missing Persons office has unnerving atmosphere of people being processed out of existence by paperwork. The sinister subway is particularly well handled and makes you think it's really the dark forces that are in control. The street scenes with no cars and few people are hauntingly spooky, as if you're all alone and something's after you. Sure, it's not realistic in a documentary sense. But, it appears this is how people often experience city life, and in a way that only the inner eye sees. Then too, it's all done in oddly poetic style, unlike most horror flicks, then or now. All the elements of a Lewton bare bones production are present-- creative use of sound and spaces, light and shadow, and several ""got-cha's"", including an unusual element for Lewton-- a fine central performance. The baby-faced Kim Hunter is just right as the gritty ingénue. As good as this minor gem is there are a number of flaws. Erford Gage, looks the part, but sometimes trips over the stilted dialogue of a Greenwich Village poet. (Interestingly, he was one of the very few Hollywood players to die in WWII.) It's also too bad that Jacques Tourneur was not available to bring his fluid camera style to bear on the material. He was the perfect director for Lewton's lyrical notions, as the poetic I Walked with a Zombie testifies. However, most at fault, is the production code of the day. No doubt the killjoy code is responsible for the smarmy lecture that is meant to show the diabolists The True Way. It's about as subtle and convincing as a hammer blow to the head and could only have come from some bureaucratic Guardian of Official Truth. It's no accident, I believe, that the true feelings of the filmmakers follow this episode with one of the most disturbingly downbeat fadeouts of that era. Nor, for that matter, is it surprising that Hitchcock was a particular fan of Lewton's. But whereas Hitchcock finds horror in the commonplace, Lewton finds the commonplace in horror. Two sides of the same coin, and judging from Hunter's inventive shower scene, a source of inspiration for Hitchcock as well."
77,The Seventh Victim,8,3 December 2002,Stylish thriller,"An unusual story involves a young woman's search for her missing sister, who formed an affiliation with a group of pacifist Satanists (?!) and gave away her beauty parlor just before disappearing.Hunter is very effective here in her film debut.  The photography and direction are first rate; the story has just enough twists and interesting characters (like the magician/psychiatrist) to make for a very compelling film.  Great atmospheric suspense."
78,The Seventh Victim,7,21 October 2005,The Lord's   Prayer  Was  Even Quoted  in  this  Film !,"Whenever a picture is produced by Val Lewton, you know it will be something different and mysterious. Val had to work on a shoe string budget in making this film, which he was very skilled at doing. He produced ""The Body Snatcher"",'45 and many other weird pictures, ""Cat Woman"", etc etc. However, all the props and doors on hotels and subways looked like plywood and just bounced around trying to close. Tom Conway,(Dr. Louis Judd),""The Falcon's Brother"",42, was a head shrink in this picture an gave a great supporting role. Jean Gibson, (Jacqueline Gibson),""The Falcon in Danger"",'43, was a rather mixed up gal who got involved with some organization that like to look into the dark world of Spirits and turned up missing. Kim Hunter,(Mary Gibson),"" A Streetcar Named Desire"",'51, was Jacqueline's sister and decided to leave a school for young girls and traveled to NYC in order to find out just where her sister wound up. There are many people that Mary Gibson ran into trying to find her sister and many older men interested in her youth. Doctor Louis Judd, surprised me when he quoted a passage from the Lord's Prayer in order to slap down the doubting of an evil minded poor soul. You will find the ending rather hard to believe. Enjoy!"
79,The Seventh Victim,3,16 January 2017,Meet Miss Cleopatra-Hair & The Palladists,"Believe me, I really did try to cut this 1943 Mystery/Thriller (about modern-day devil worshippers operating in NYC) some serious slack. I really did.But, when it finally came around to meeting these ""Palladists"" (aka. Satan's ass-kissers) - They, unfortunately, came across (to me) as being even more dreary and joyless than a bunch of snivelling bible-thumpers - And, because of that - I had no choice but to rate this moronic picture with just a 3-star rating.Yes. I do realize that the Hays Code was in full effect at the time that ""The 7th Victim"" was released - But, all the same - This picture certainly could have delivered a more substantially worthwhile wallop (considering its subject matter) than it inevitably did.Anyway - In my opinion - This was one of those vintage pictures that was so bad that it was downright laughable. Thank goodness that all of this devil-worship nonsense only had a 70-minute running time."
80,The Seventh Victim,5,28 October 2015,"Disappointing, dull and completely overrated","Traveling to New York, a woman looking for her missing sister hears that she has been involved with a supposed cult of devil-worshipers living in the area who after learning the awful truth about the group must escape before they get to her.There wasn't a whole lot here that works. The ending minutes are its best, where it contains a chase through a series of darkened hallways that's effectively eerie and manages to get some wonderful chills in the midst of it which is the film's best scene. The ending is a nice shock gag where something actually happens in the film that really scores, highlighted mostly by the lighting in the scene so it stands out even more. The meetings with the group are pretty chilling, and the one memorable image of a room opening to reveal a chair with a noose over it is a good shock. The only other scene that manages to standout is a pretty good confrontation between one character in a shower and another one outside shown only through shadows that really feels quite creepy for its unknown quality. They're the only things worthwhile about the film as this here is a little bit of a disappointment. The main issue holding this back is the fact that the film sets up its second half revelation of the group, leaving the front-end a little slow. There's really only a few moments in the film beforehand that manage to score anything of interest. The pace of the investigation is simply the main issue, being filled up with large amounts of talking over what has actually happened so far in the search that's mostly devoted to having everything told to everyone else about what's happening so far to each other. That leaves the film without a whole lot of action in it, giving it the appearance of a really laid-back film. There's really nothing going on as it's all verbally repeated to everyone else, so it makes it seem like nothing has happened in the film. This is the main thing wrong.Today's Rating-PG: Mild Violence."
81,The Seventh Victim,2,20 April 2015,Couldn't find anything redeeming,"Often I do cut older movies some more slack because of the limitations they had but this one pretty much failed in all aspects for me. Most of the movie revolves around a young woman, still a student, seeking for her older sister who has disappeared. Some people want to help her in her quest others are less helpful. The movie muddles on a bit with a few things happening, some boring dialog. The movie never really gets going, you never get to know any of the characters (all uninteresting) well. Apparently totally out of the blue the husband or was it boyfriend of the missing girl has feelings for the youngest sister. And than there is also that mysterious sect which doesn't fit in very well in the whole thing. No this really was a big mess."
82,The Seventh Victim,6,15 October 1999,The Lord's Prayer,"This was an excellent, dark film.  The melodrama and the, at times, laughable dialogue made the movie even more enjoyable.  There are however a few scenes which will allow you to suspend disbelief and, in so doing, make you forget that the film is 50 or so years old.  I believe that the coup de grace of the film, the tasty tidbit that I'm going to take from the viewing experience and store in my memory vaults, must be the next to last scene. Don't worry, it's not important to the actual story.  Anyway, just in case, I'm going to express the scene in a mathematical formula: Lord's Prayer + Satanists = shame."
83,The Seventh Victim,4,18 April 2016,A Horrible Script Dooms This Film,"""The Seventh Victim"" includes some interesting literary allusions and references, and it provides a parade of actors who are fun to identify for modern viewers, but otherwise it is not worth viewing.The story is about a young woman, Mary (Kim Hunter), who goes to New York City to find her sister, Jacqueline (Jean Brooks). It seems Jacqueline has fallen in with a satanic cult that does little more than try to keep its members from resigning. The story is mostly filmed at night, of course, which allows for plenty of scenes with abundant shadows--so the viewer can be frightened (?) by animals running into trash cans and irrelevant characters standing under street lights.Evidently other viewers disagree, but I found many reasons to find this film superficial and ineffective. Some call it a suspense drama, but I felt no suspense. There is a minimal amount of mystery involving Jacqueline's whereabouts, but the resolution of that mystery is a tremendous letdown, as is the film's ending.I blame the director and the screenwriter for most of the film's failures. It feels like each actor was given directions unrelated to other characters, like ""You behave as if you are always close to going over the edge. You act like nothing much matters. You ignore the concerns of the others and make offhand remarks about your apartment. You sit in the half shadows and every once in a while you can shift your eyes from side to side."" Of course the script is primarily responsible for the disjointed nature of the film.A much more effective and unified film, for example, is ""Rosemary's Baby"".I would much rather read about this film than watch it. For its time, I think it tried to be modern. Symbolism is used throughout in an attempt to directly access the emotions of viewers, but the film in its entirety is too silly to support that attempt. Furthermore, the childish use of religion undercuts that effort. Does anyone really seriously fear or find heinous a group of cultists who are intimidated and cowed by the reading of a Bible passage?"
84,The Seventh Victim,1,8 November 2015,*,"You're in store for satanic misery when you see this awful 1943 film.Kim Hunter spends the entire film looking for her missing sister. The latter is often seen with a Cleopatra like-hair-do and is constantly seeking out death.While searching, Kim meets up with the people around the sister's orbit. Seems as though she has joined a Satanic cult and as they claim she has betrayed them, she must die!Only Isabell Jewell has her moments as one of the members of this sick group. Jewell can burst forth crying, but this is not like her condemned seamstress 8 years earlier in the magnificent ""Tale of Two Cities.""Along the way, Hunter finds love with a guy she later discovers is married to the cookie sister. How convenient the sister makes it for them at film's end. Let us say a merciful end."
85,The Seventh Victim,,1 January 2014,All My Pleasures Are As Yesterday,"A girl (Kim Hunter in her film debut) searches for her missing sister in New York City and stumbles across cult of devil-worshippers. Eerie chiller is the fourth of producer Val Lewton's famous psychological horror films at RKO. Director Mark Robson does a great job in creating an unsettling and spooky atmosphere. The film's only significant flaw is the romantic subplot. This part is forced and rushed, even moreso than was typical of romance in films of the time where ""love at first sight"" was the rule not the exception. The thirteen year age difference doesn't help. Overall, it's an effective and moody film that has film noir touches and a bleak but memorable ending."
86,The Seventh Victim,,12 March 2008,Good Film,"Seventh Victim, The (1943) *** (out of 4) Val Lewton thriller about a woman (Kim Hunter) who goes searching for her missing sister and tracks her down to a group of devil worshipers. Here's another oddball horror film from producer Lewton, which is actually more film noir than anything else. It's rather clear that Lewton pretty much shaped the film noir genre, although it appears noir fans haven't really caught onto that. The performances are all good and the mystery and dread of the film come off quite nicely. You can also tell that this film influenced future films like the work of Mario Bava."
