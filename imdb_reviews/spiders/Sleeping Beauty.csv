0,Sleeping Beauty,10,18 January 2004,A Disney classic,"When I was a little girl, Sleeping Beauty was my all time favorite Disney film. I was so in love with this story, it's crazy how many times I wore out the VHS. But growing up, I lost touch with the story, but I recently bought the DVD and re-watched the film and you know what? I'm still in love with this movie. I really miss these old Disney movies where the animation was so bright and beautiful, the characters were so lovable, and the story was so magical. I'm not bashing Disney films from today, just I'm sure we could all relate on this subject where the older Disney films just had a certain charm about it. Sleeping Beauty is just a timeless story and has so much wonderful romance, I guess since I'm a girl, I just couldn't help but still be in love with this beautiful story.Princess Aurora is born and is the future queen of her land, three fairy's, Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna bless her with three gifts: beauty and song, right as Merryweather is about to bless Aurora, the evil witch, Maleficent, comes in and curses Aurora that she shall touch a spinning wheel by her 16th birthday and die! Merryweather changes it to where she won't die, but sleep and could only be woke up by the kiss of true love. The fairy's wish to keep this from happening still, so they take Aurora and raise her as their own. One day Aurora on her 16th birthday goes out in the forest and meets the charming and handsome Prince Phillipe, but she doesn't know he's a prince and she doesn't know he's fhe man she's actually betrothed too. She is told by the fairy's that she can never see him again and that she's a princess; later that night the curse happens! Now the fairy's need Phillipe to save Aurora before it's too late.Everything about Sleeping Beauty is just a perfect Disney film and I can't wait until to show this to my future kids one day. I know that their generation is going to have just the CGI animation, so it's good that at least we still have these films, they're treasures. The voices, the animation, the story, Sleeping Beauty is the most romantic fairy tale that anyone could easily fall in love with. If you are a Disney fan, this is a must see, it's a great family film or if you're just a film buff in general, I'm a grown up and I still tear up when I watch Sleeping Beauty.10/10"
1,Sleeping Beauty,9,9 July 2006,Hail to the Princess Aurora!,"""Sleeping Beauty"" was envisioned by the great Walt Disney as his masterpiece--the feature-length cartoon par excellence. And, in many ways, it is. The then-record budget (six million dollars) was the largest ever for an animated motion picture. The widescreen Technirama 70 process had never been used for an animated feature. The six-track magnetic stereo sound was a step upward from the ""Fantasound"" system employed in ""Fantasia"" (1940). Also new and trend-setting was the style of the animation--a more realistic, geometric design which, surprisingly left many critics and audiences cold. The extra expense needed to showcase the widescreen film properly, together with the lukewarm reviews, prevented ""Sleeping Beauty"" from turning a profit at the box office when it was released (with much fanfare) in 1959. But time has been kind to the film, subsequent reissues have finally put it in the profit margin, and both viewers and critics are appreciating it for the beautiful fantasy it has always been. However, like it's predecessor ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937) which was Disney's first fairy tale, as well as his first full-length film, this screen adaptation of ""Sleeping Beauty"" strays from it's origins. While the Charles Perrault version of the tale is given as the source, there are new variations. The original story is as follows: When a baby girl is born to a King and Queen, they invite seven (or, in the Grimm version, twelve) Fairies to the christening. Uninvited is an evil fairy, who shows up anyway, and curses the child with death on her 16th birthday. Although a good fairy is able to alter the spell, the princess is doomed to sleep (along with the court) for 100 years. Despite the precautions taken, the curse is fulfilled (accidentally, in most versions of the story) and the princess does indeed sleep for a century, after which a prince awakens her. Understandably, Disney's telling departs from Perrault here as well, because in Perrault's version, the King and Queen are the sole members of the court who do not succumb to the sleeping spell, and, eventually die of old age. The Disney version of the tale whittles the number of good fairies down to three, giving them the appearance and personalities of elderly women. Meanwhile, the evil fairy, dubbed Maleficent, is a cold, flamboyant villainess who, for better or worse, overshadows everyone else in the film (but then, the villain always does). Disney's retelling also dispenses with the Heroine's 100 year sleep which lasts merely one night. There is much emphasis put on the three fairies who secretly, in the guise of peasants, raise the baby princess Aurora, (whom they dub ""Briar Rose"" interestingly, the name given the Princess in the Grimm retelling) and, unwittingly make it possible for Maleficent to execute her curse. Also new, is the introduction at the beginning of the film of Prince Phillip, who is immediately betrothed to Aurora. The climatic battle he has with the evil fairy, here transformed into a dragon, has become one of the most memorable parts of the film, though it was purely the scriptwriter's invention. In the end, however, it is best to appreciate the film as a stand-alone creation, rather than a faithful adaptation of a classic story. Indeed, as some latter-day critics have pointed out, ""Sleeping Beauty"" has been embraced by the young and old audiences who find in it many of the same sword and sorcery elements in films like ""Legend"" and ""Excalibur"". And every penny of it's then-unprecedented budget is on the screen. One marvels at the intricate design of the animation, all accomplished well before the advent of computers, which the Technirama screen showcases to full effect. The voice talent is perfect. Mary Costa, who went on to an estimable opera career, is a lovely and expressive Aurora, while Bill Shirley is an ingratiating Prince Phillip. Eleanor Audley (so deliciously cold as the stepmother in Disney's ""Cinderella"") is the embodiment of majestic evil as Maleficent. Verna Felton (the Fairy Godmother in Disney's ""Cinderella""), Barbara Jo Allen and Barbara Luddy are the delightful (and all too human) fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Aurora's father, King Stefan, is voiced by Taylor Holmes, with Bill Thompson as Phillip's father King Hubert. A word should also be said for Candy Candido, who provided the sounds made by Maleficent's goons. The Tchaykovsky ballet score provides both the background music and melodies used for the new songs. All this blends perfectly in an epic adventure/fantasy seldom experienced on screen, and one with enough heart to capture the most cynical viewer. The Special Edition DVD, released in 2003, and currently out of print, is another example of what a ""Special Edition"" truly encompasses, including a fully restored widescreen print of the film, a new 5.1 stereo mix which fully showcases the Academy Award nominated score, as well as many bonus features with appeal to all ages (including a widescreen/fullscreen comparison which should be the last word on that subject). Also included are several complimentary historical shorts like the Academy Award winning ""Grand Canyon"" which accompanied ""Sleeping Beauty"" on it's initial release. Trailers, games, interviews with Mary Costa and surviving animators, vintage featurettes which delve into the making of the film, and last, but not least, footage of Disney himself, complete the dazzling package. Finally awakened from her long slumber, and more refreshingly lovely than ever, ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a film (and DVD) for the ages."
2,Sleeping Beauty,8,5 September 2003,I have a theory about this movie...,"...which is that it may have been designed more for an adult audience than a children's. At any rate it was way ahead of its time in 1959. ""Sleeping Beauty"" was one of the movies I watched as a child, and its grandness overwhelmed me even at the age of ten. I couldn't be happier to see it finally in the DVD format. But watch closely; you'll notice many subtle, sophisticated things which other viewers have touched on in earlier reviews. The animation is almost surreal-- so incredibly lifelike that it abandons its cute, 'Disneyesque' pretensions from previous fairy tales. There are no talking mice, dogs or cats anywhere to be seen. Here the animals are silent, as animals are supposed to be. (I love the sequence with the forest animals as they are awakened by the singing of the barefoot princess and join up with her, like multiple chaperons, in harmonious whistles.) Even the fairy godmothers- who may initially appear as sugary stereotypes- spend so much time bickering (well, two of them do anyway) that you get to identify them as thoroughly fleshed out personalities. The adaptation of the original Perrault fairy tale is also impressive. An ingenious move was to have the prince and princess meet in the forest *first* and fall in love- unaware that they are already engaged to be married. Someone mentioned the chilling sequence which shows the princess, cloaked in an eerie green pallor, actually being lured to the fateful spinning wheel. So dark, so frightening- when was the last time you saw something like this in a Disney fairy tale? And then immediately afterwords is a cleansing sequence of unmatched beauty showing the fairies sailing through the sky like fireflies, magically dusting the rest of the castle to sleep. It is, of course, only matched by the film's finale which shows storm clouds, lightning, a forest of thorns, and a flame-spewing dragon-- all seamlessly bringing the story to a 75-minute conclusion. It stands, in my opinion, as Disney's masterpiece."
3,Sleeping Beauty,10,28 June 2003,"""You know, sometimes I don't think she's very happy.""","I grew up in the Disney era where ""Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" reigned supreme among me and my elementary school pals (and to this day, if you ask one of my peers what their favorite Disney movie is, it's probably one of those or one of the Disney-Pixar creations).  But one Disney film has always remained my utter favorite and that is, indeed, ""Sleeping Beauty.""Like most children, I grew up watching Disney movies -- everything from animated films like ""Snow White"" to ""Lady and the Tramp,"" the semi-animated like ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks,"" and the non-animated such as ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Old Yeller.""  But ""Sleeping Beauty"" remains my favorite animated movie and you'd better believe at seventeen years of age, I'm still watching it.  I cannot believe how the animation has been knocked in some reviews -- it's beautiful!  They captured the medieval period so well and even the people look like, well, people.  The score is beautiful and the songs ""I Wonder"" and ""Once Upon a Dream"" are sung wonderfully by Mary Costa.  What a voice!  Aurora is by far one of the prettiest Disney princesses (one thing that initially drew me to the movie as a child), following the formula with those trademark doe-eyes that Disney bestows upon all of their princesses and heroines.  Prince Phillip actually does more than just show up to sing a song and say one line, a welcome change that answers the age old question, ""What does she see in him anyway?"" The three fairies are delightful (I always wanted to be Fauna!) and funny. And of course, there's the quintessential villain -- Maleficent.  She scared me when I was younger and when I view the film now, no wonder.  (For the longest time, I was also scared of Eleanor Audley period, but she's truly a marvelous actress.)  And when Phillip kills her -- yeah, you'd better believe that's some scary business.  The story is beautiful and funny, the animation is divine, the music ethereal, and the voice talents extraordinary.  This is a personal favorite and it comes highly recommended!"
4,Sleeping Beauty,,15 April 2001,Some films improve with age...'Sleeping Beauty' is one of them...,"When 'Sleeping Beauty' was first released it was the target of critical villification--perhaps because of the more stylized art work. The art work is actually a leap forward from 'Snow White' and the earlier classics. It took me awhile to get used to the new technique when I first viewed the film--but now I recognize how effectively it manages to convey the ""feel"" of a genuine fairy-tale. A nice discussion of the art work is featured in 'The Making of Sleeping Beauty' which accompanies the latest VHS release of the film. Aside from the richly textured backgrounds and brilliant animation, 'Beauty' is blessed with the rapturous singing voice of Mary Costa's light soprano doing full justice to the ballad, 'Once Upon A Dream'. The idea of using Tchaikovsky's 'Sleeping Beauty' music for the background score and songs was an excellent decision. This is a film that can be enjoyed on so many different levels--music, animation, story, art work--it ranks with the very best of the classic fairy-tales from Disney. And yes, Maleficent, in all of her wicked glory, makes the most impressive fire-breathing dragon you're ever likely to see!"
5,Sleeping Beauty,,24 July 2004,One of Disney's best,"Simplest possible explanation of what cements Sleeping Beauty's place as an immortal classic: Maleficent.Sleeping Beauty was never one of my favorite Disney movies, my parents having lost the tape really early. Since maybe ten years I haven't seen the movie, but now, after seeing it again, I have to admit, it's a masterpiece. I don't understand why it was so berated on first release. Where the critics expecting Snow White? 'Cause this is no Snow White. It's much better.A long, long time ago, in a kingdom far, far away, King Stefan and the Queen have a daughter, Aurora, so-called because she brought sunshine to their lives. There is a great celebration, and the neighboring kingdom's Prince Phillip is betrothed to Aurora. The three Good Fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, are invited. Flora and Fauna bestow gifts of beauty and song upon Aurora. Before Merryweather can cast her spell, the uninvited Maleficent--the Mistress of All Evil--arrives, furious at not being invited. She curses Aurora, predicting that at the age of sixteen the princess will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning-wheel and die. Merryweather counteracts this by making Aurora go into a deep sleep were she ever to prick her finger, to be reawakened by true love's first kiss. To keep her safe, the fairies take her into the forest, no longer using magic, and calling Aurora Briar Rose. The princess knows nothing of her heritage, and meets no other humans, except for a man ""Once Upon A Dream"".One of the greatest things about the movie is the style. The contrast between characters and surroundings (except for Maleficent) is stark. The backgrounds and layouts are colorful, stylized, round and angular at the same time. The characters, however, aim for total realism, except for the minor ones, who are clearly cartoon characters. The animation is beautiful. The movements smooth, the artistry unbelievably high quality. If there was no other likable thing about the movie, the animation would go a long way to saving it.The story of Sleeping Beauty is, of course, set in stone. Despite everyone's complete familiarity with the fairy tale, the movie manages to enliven it and make it gripping, even though everyone has heard it a thousand times. A most definite improvement in the story is the scene in which Aurora pricks her finger. In the original the spinning-wheel was owned by an innocent old peasant, who just happened to own the last wheel in the land, unnoticed by the rest of the world. In the movie Maleficent hypnotizes Aurora, and commands her to prick her finger. In addition to the atmosphere of foreboding already present in the story, the movie adds genuine suspense, largely owing to the brilliant presence of the wicked fairy.The characterization is very different from other Disney movies in some ways, but very like others. Usually in Disney's princess movies, the princess herself is something of a cypher, a passive element. This is true for Sleeping Beauty (she has no control over the three basic actions in the movie). The prince usually has an even more minute part, although the story would be nothing without him. Not so this movie. Here Phillip is a much more active character, a hero who battles dragons and witches, who goes through all sorts of hazards. In Snow White all the unnamed prince does is show up and kiss our heroine, in Cinderella Charming risks nothing and is nothing but a prop. But the ultimate character is, of course, Maleficent. Supervised by Disney's women's animator-in-chief, Marc Davis, hers has to be one of the great performances in animation. She is brilliantly drawn, amazingly voiced, and the dragon she transforms into is not just a dragon: it is HER particular dragon (a method taken to greater lengths in The Sword in the Stone). She is magnificent. The three fairies are quarrelsome all right, but they are caricatures that convey particularly clearly their good-naturalness.Sleeping Beauty is one of those irreplaceable masterpieces. It is a magnificent retelling of a classic fairy tale, with no undue distortion of the source material. Come to think of it, the story EXISTS to be made into a movie; it's just perfect. And near-perfection is what Disney achieved.9.5/10"
6,Sleeping Beauty,7,21 April 2003,Good Disney cartoon features Tchaikowsky's ballet,"This Disney cartoon feature has the familiar-princess-in-distress theme of a lovely girl, kind fairies, a handsome prince, forbidding castles and an evil witch. A perceived slight by a king and queen enrages a sorceress who casts an evil spell on the child that will take effect on her sixteenth birthday. Only her prince charming's kiss can save the girl from an unhappy fate and the frightening Maleficent stops at nothing to locate the princess in order to bring her prophecy to fruition. There are several pitched battles between the prince and the fairies against the forces of evil that accelerates into an exciting combat at the finish. The picture is bathed in beautiful color and the music of Tchaikowsky's ballet serves as a wonderful musical accompaniment."
7,Sleeping Beauty,7,17 August 2007,Ambitious and stylish,"The 16th animated Disney classic is a fairy-tale but different from the other Disney classics because of its medieval artwork. It's not the fairy tale genre that makes this one of Disney's most distinguish Disney animated films, but its artwork. This artwork is stylish and obeys to high quality standards, not to mention that the sceneries and backgrounds are good in general.This is one of the Disney classics which took more time to be made and perhaps one of their most ambitious. In fact, maybe because of its medieval artwork, it spent about 6 or 7 years in production. This spent nearly the whole 1950 decade in production. A very long time, even for an animated film. Only ""The Black Cauldron"" took as much time as this to be made, but we can't compare ""The Black Cauldron"" to the undeniably superior ""Sleeping Beauty"".There is a curious fact that surrounds the movie's final scene (when Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora dance above the clouds): that ""trick"" was actually tried in ""Cinderella"", but they only managed to do it successfully in ""Sleeping Beauty"".As a movie, generally speaking it is pretty good, happy, pleasant, magic, romantic, sometimes dramatic and emotional, while classic humor is not forgotten either (there are many funny moments, actually). On the other hand, this movie is also extremely dark in some parts, although it doesn't go as far as ""The Black Cauldron"" does when it comes to extreme darkness. Even if ""Sleeping Beauty"" has its dark side, it isn't much darker than what we see in many other Disney animated films.Maleficent is the kind of villain I can't find a correct word to describe: an evil queen? A queen of darkness? An evil fairy? A witch? A sorceress? Whatever she is, she looks sinister, yet she isn't that scary considering her appearance. She's nowhere near as scary and chilly as the Horned King from ""The Black Cauldron"". Eleanor Audley, with that powerful voice, does a spectacular job as Maleficent's voice.Aurora (aka ""Briar Rose"") is a gorgeous princess with an even more beautiful voice. She's also a wonderful singer. Mary Costa does beautifully her voice.Prince Phillip is one of the coolest and most charming Disney princes of all time. And one of the funniest too. His horse Samson is one of the coolest and funniest horses of all time. Prince Phillip is brilliantly voiced by Bill Shirley.The queen (Aurora's mother) appears very little during the whole movie (we only see her at the beginning and at the end). King Stephan is a great dude and King Hubert is quite a funny guy. An especially funny scene with them is when they are discussing about Phillip and Aurora and Hubert starts fighting with a fish as if it was a sword and they end up laughing of that. Both characters are greatly voiced by the respective actors.As for the 3 good fairies (Fauna, Flora and Merryweather), I'd say that my favorite is Merryweather. She is the funniest of the three. Also, I like the blue dress better than the pink one (although both colors fit well on the dress). But the blue is always prettier than the pink.The animals which Aurora meets in the forest are other charming characters. The funniest one is the owl. Speaking of animals, Maleficent's pet raven is an interesting character yet a bit annoying - what a snitch that thing is!As for the soundtrack, it is entirely beautiful but the best is in ""Once Upon a Dream"" and the famous classical music ""Sleeping Beauty ballet"" by Tchaikovsky.Just to finalize my review, this movie was very unsuccessful when it originally came out in 1959, almost bankrupting the Disney studio. But it won loyal fans through the years and reached a cult status. I guess you can say that time has been kind to it."
8,Sleeping Beauty,9,7 December 2008,This High-Def Transfer Will Blow You Away!,"Quick......what was ""Sleeping Beauty's"" name? Answer: Either ""Princess Aurora"" or ""Rose,"" depending on where she was.Most of you probably know that but I didn't, probably because I hadn't watched this movie since it came out about a half century ago! I was a little kid, and never did see this again on TV or VHS. I only saw it again because several high-definition DVD websites said this looked spectacular on Blu-Ray.How right they were; this looks incredible! I cannot believe how fantastic the artwork is, and sharp the picture comes through on this restored high-def disc. The colors and the amount of details in all the art are astounding. Many of the scenes had my jaw dropping in admiration. The story, frankly, is not anything that great for a man my age but the visuals are so fantastic that I enjoyed the experience.I also appreciated the 2.55:1 widescreen picture. If you've only seen this on formatted-to-TV 4:3, and love the movie, you owe it to yourself to see this version. You won't believe how good this 1959 film looks."
9,Sleeping Beauty,8,24 June 2004,An Inspired Classic,"""Sleeping Beauty"" is definitely a classic among the Disney animated features.  It bears the distinction of being the first to be shot in 70mm widescreen format.  The score borrows much from Tchaikovsky's classic ballet based on the Brothers Grimm tale.  The art is beautiful, being inspired by medieval art.  And the characters are delightful, particularly the three Good Fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather.  Malificient makes for a wonderful villainess, with awesome magical powers.  Even those who would not call this Disney's best animated feature should agree that it harkens back to the famed studio's golden age.  It's a classic that all ages can treasure!"
10,Sleeping Beauty,,19 July 2015,"Masterfully animated, great villain","Sleeping Beauty is one of the more uneven Disney classics. Meaning that while some of its elements are frankly speaking revolutionary, culture-changing even, it has some other elements that are not really that good, not by Disney standards or even objectively.First the good stuff. The animation is quite frankly among the best Disney has produced. Ever. The characters move with fluid grace, the colours defy believe and help the whole movie leap from the screen and the attention to detail is amazing. But it's the backgrounds which make this one of the, if not the best movie Disney has ever released. The designs are fantastically medieval, the amount of detail they have put into every frame is unbelievable and it's no wonder it took so long to produce and cost so much that it really had no realistic hope of making its money back. But it was worth it. This is animation art in its finest form. Every single frame worthy of being framed and hanged on the wall.And then there's Maleficent, the finest Disney villain since the original Evil Queen from Snow White, and the first one to truly eclipse her. And she's still amazing. Eleanor Audley really gives her a threatening presence with her voice alone. She can be quietly menacing when she needs to be, but when she's truly enraged, she also has the lungs to back it up. Plus the character design, the storyline, they're all enough to cement her as one of the great ones.Then the bad stuff. Aurora and Prince Phillip are awful. Their character designs are great, but they have no screen time to build chemistry, their romance is one of the quickest even by Disney standards, their storyline is not interesting and as a whole they're a dreadful bore.Luckily the three fairymothers are a lot of fun. They're not on Maleficent's level, but they hold the movie together admirably.Sleeping Beauty is one of the best Disney movies. It's not the best because quite frankly I can't stand the romantic couple in it, but aside from that, it holds a dear place in my heart."
11,Sleeping Beauty,8,21 September 2014,A delight from start to finish,"If there's one thing that separates the classic Disney era from it's modern efforts, then it was their ability to truly bring a fairytale to life. The moral and narrative simplicity of the fairytale formula is now portrayed somewhat cynically, with their black-and-white ethics and la-de-da princesses receiving a lampooning in the likes of Shrek (2001) and Enchanted (2007). Although this can make for clever and amusing viewing, it makes it easy to forget how beguiling these stories can be. Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's finest, and a perfect example of how the make-believe world of witches, fairies, kings and princesses can truly enthral and fill a young heart with wonder.King Stefan and Queen Leah welcome the birth of their daughter, Princess Aurora (Mary Costa), and invite their subjects to pay homage at their castle. The baby is thrice blessed by the three good fairies, Flora (Verna Felton), Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen) and Merryweather (Barbara Luddy), until the evil sorceress Maleficent (Eleanor Audley) gate-crashes the party. Maleficent curses the princess and announces that on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die. The curse is dented somewhat when Merryweather intercepts, meaning that Aurora will not die, but will fall into an eternal sleep unless she receives true love's kiss.Inspired by the Brothers Grimm's Little Briar Rose and The Sleeping Beauty by Charles Perrault, the film, under the directorial supervision of Clyde Geronimi, has some of the finest animation work ever put out by Disney. The last Disney film to use hand-inked cells, animators Marc Davis, Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, John Lounsbery, Wolfgang Reitherman and Eric Larson, create a beautiful world reminiscent of the colourful Medievals film that were so popular in the 1950's, when Technicolor was a-booming. The climax, which sees the horned demon Maleficent turn into a dragon, was revolutionary in it's day and is still unnervingly striking today. The romance between Aurora and her betrothed - the amusingly named Prince Phillip (Bill Shirley) - is rather unconvincing and wishy-washy, but it does little damage to a movie that is a delight from start to finish.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
12,Sleeping Beauty,8,25 October 2007,Tolkien and Tchaikovsky meet at the Magic Kingdom,"Walt Disney - whether as cartoonist, filmmaker, impresario, or business mogul - was so innovative in so many ways that some of his more distinctive innovations tend to get lost in the shuffle. One important way in which he was a pioneer was the introduction of European expressionistic film techniques to American family audiences. This truth is rarely acknowledged, but it had enormous consequences for popular culture. While the expressionist style had been employed by American filmmakers before, Disney was the first to fuse that aesthetic with the bubblegum realm in which he dealt - the realm of fairy tales, caricatures, and slapstick. This marriage of high and low cultural forms would pave the way for many filmmakers in the years ahead, the most obvious example probably being Tim Burton (who started out, appropriately enough, as a Disney animator). And perhaps no animated feature that Walt oversaw between the 1930s and his death in 1966 exemplifies this style as superbly as SLEEPING BEAUTY.Even while watching this as a child, I readily grasped that SLEEPING BEAUTY was of a breed quite different from most of what Disney had created either before or since. Perhaps most obviously, the animation is about as exquisite as one could hope from a movie made in the days before computer technology. Unlike the forest in SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, for example, the forest in this film looks real. There is some depth to it, as well as a juxtaposition of light and shade. It is the kind of forest that seems to harbor secrets - a place where you would not be at all shocked to stumble upon a lonely cottage or see the mysterious flickering of fluorescent lights in the night.Even more profound, however, is the film's provocative thematic language. Though the story itself - the rescue of a princess from the forces of evil by a swashbuckling prince and his fairy allies - is starkly simple, the setting is finely textured both psychologically and culturally. Prior to the 1990s, this was probably Disney's most morally mature work; evil here is not some freakish or even alien phenomenon, but something disturbingly ordinary that seems to stalk the characters through every moment of their lives. The Gothic citadel of the wicked sprite Maleficent, from its perch atop Forbidden Mountain, looms over the countryside as a permanent and highly visible threat. When night falls, the heroic characters scuttle fearfully through the dusky shadows that extend over the land; it can be difficult to tell friend from foe. When the naive Prince Philip knocks on the door of Aurora's cottage and hears a sweet female voice greeting him, he has no way of knowing that a mob of batlike demons is about to fall upon him.SLEEPING BEAUTY holds the rare distinction of being both universalist and groundbreaking. To a child, everything is immediately recognizable: the forest, the castle, Maleficent's lair. But Disney goes even further, imbuing each locale with an individual and wholly organic character that nonetheless collectively constitutes a thematic whole. It is hard to put a name to such a luscious style (medieval Gothic expressionist?); but the nooks and crannies would eventually find their way into other Disney films (most notably THE SWORD IN THE STONE) and then into other multimedia entertainments. Perhaps a little ironically, Disney was - whether consciously or not - drawing upon idioms that existed in 1950s culture but had yet to register on the mass-media radar. Most obviously, his knack for rendering rich landscapes and evoking themes that united pagan fantasy with Christian morality owed much to the mythology created by J. R. R. Tolkien of THE LORD OF THE RINGS fame. (It is difficult not to liken Forbidden Mountain to Mount Doom, where the climax of THE RETURN OF THE KING takes place.) Baby-boomers who might have seen SLEEPING BEAUTY as children would almost surely have noticed its motifs retooled in the 1960s paperback editions of Tolkien's books, and later in the fairy-tale rock of such 1970s musical groups as Led Zeppelin, Rainbow, and Heart.And speaking of music, there is only one instance in which the ballets of Tchaikovsky were more perfectly realized in cinematic form: Disney's other expressionist masterpiece, FANTASIA. Tchaikovsky's composing style is ideal for the staging of fairy tales: more than any other composer of the nineteenth century, he possessed a talent for writing music that called to mind such rarefied notions and images that it seemed almost to be otherworldly. (Igor Stravinsky, whose RITE OF SPRING was also memorably mounted in a sequence in FANTASIA, is another such composer.) Some traditionalists were appalled by the interweaving of original lyrics with Tchaikovsky's immortal music in SLEEPING BEAUTY; but considering that the lyrics fit the music perfectly, I didn't mind at all.SLEEPING BEAUTY takes place in a Manichean world of extremes, where the eternal questions of existence must be forcefully answered and where the villain must not be merely defeated but destroyed. And it is one of the few Disney films to acknowledge a world beyond: ""Now you will deal with me....and all the powers of HELL!"" But if there is a Hell, there must be a Heaven: Aurora and Philip do live ""happily ever after,"" but not without a period of trial where it must be decided whether ""evil die and good endure."""
13,Sleeping Beauty,10,26 April 2007,Exquisite,"This movie gets 10 points on it's look alone. It is stunning to watch, especially in the widescreen format. The amount of detail and effort that went into it blows my mind. Being an art student, I appreciate this kind of work tremendously. The music is also exquisite, taken from the famous ballet.The story is good enough- I love the feisty Merriweather, and it has my favorite prince- Phillip. He was the first Disney prince to actually have any development or really do something. Another thing is this movie is not goofy at all! Yes, it has some cutesy forest creatures, but they don't talk and they aren't overly cartooney. Instead, there is some truly funny dialogue and situational comedy that doesn't pander to a 5 year old sensibility. Besides, we have Maleficent, an amazing, dark, seductive villain. She is never weak or unintimidating. I would be terrified to go against her.Overall, one of my favorite Disney films alongside Hunchback and Beauty and the Beast. The most beautiful piece of animation ever- hands down.Quote of the film:You poor simple fools. Thinking you could defeat me, ME! The Mistress of All Evil!"
14,Sleeping Beauty,8,22 January 2006,Awaken to a World of Wonders!,"''Sleeping Beauty ''is one of the classics and one of the most famous movies from Disney as well.The cute and little princess Aurora is going to be introduced to all people of the kingdom in a big party made in her celebration. Everybody is having fun and gives Aurora's presents. (including her future husband,Prince Phillip) Until Maleficent, the bad witch, comes up and angry because she was not invited to the princess'party curses Aurora: she will die on her 16th birthday, after touching a poisoned spinning wheel. Everybody stays in panic, but for Aurora's lucky, the three nice fairies Flora, Fauna & Merryweather gives her gifts for her future, and one of them is that the curse that Maleficent made was not eternal, and only will be when Aurora's prince gives her a kiss. Anyway, the Queen and the King prefer not to risk, and agree to send their daughter to live in the forest with the fairies, with the identity of Briar Rose. They all live without magic, and without Aurora knowing about her past, since the identity of her godmothers until the fact she is a princess. The years passed and Aurora is now 16. Everything was going well to deny the curse, but with Philiph and Aurora's meet in the woods and the fact that Aurora and the three fairies are being watched,makes the situation change and many risks starts to come."
15,Sleeping Beauty,10,22 February 2009,My personal favourite of the early Disneys,"Everything about this film is beautiful. The characters, the music and the animation.The animation was lovely. It looks flat to some people, but to me it looks absolutely beautiful, and has a gorgeous stylistic look. The best scenes were actually the darker scenes, especially the climax, which is one of Disney's best. But I have to say the forest is one of the most beautifully animated forests in a Disney film. Sleeping Beauty mayn't have the strongest story development in a Disney movie, but neither the ballet or the fairytale have the best story development either, no matter how beautiful the film really is.The characters were unforgettable. Whilst Aurora was the weakest character, she was made into a beautiful woman with lots of grace, class and charm, who dreamed of falling in love, and Mary Costa's vocals were sublime. Phillip is also well done, but these two characters don't say much in comparison, I noticed, except Phillip has some great lines. The forest scene with the animals was charming, and you have to laugh at the three fairies when they tried to make the dress. The fairies added a huge amount to this film, as did Meleficent, who terrified me when I was younger. There was a long time when I was so scared of her and the part when she entices Aurora to the spinning wheel, that I refused to see the film for about two years.The music by Tchaikovsky was outstanding. He is a fantastic composer, one of my all time favourites. The music to the climax has been imitated by many Disneys but never as well. I recommend you see the ballet, which bears little resemblance to the film itself, but the music is a knockout, like Beethoven's Choral Symphony.In conclusion, an ambitious(being the most expensive Disney project) but beautiful film, that has captivated me since I was little, and I am 16 now. 10/10.

16,Sleeping Beauty,6,18 May 2014,"Not so much ""Sleeping Beauty"" so much as ""The Three Good Fairies""","Walt Disney's 16th full-length animated feature ""Sleeping Beauty"" (1959) could really be retitled ""The Three Good Fairies"" instead. The reason being is that its narrative, oddly enough, puts more focus on them than it ever does on the title character. But I'll have more to say about that later. Let's briefly discuss the plot. If you think about it, ""Sleeping Beauty"" is just ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937) all over again. Only instead of seven dwarfs and a poison apple, we get three fairies and a spinning wheel. A princess named Aurora is cursed at birth by a witch named Maleficent who states that on her 16th birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The three good fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather assist King Stefan and the Queen by raising Aurora in a cottage somewhere deep in the woods. By doing this, they hope to prevent Maleficent and her minions from finding her. When this curse is broken, King Stefan and King Hubert hope to unite their kingdoms by having Prince Philip marry Aurora. It's pretty safe to say that those who've seen this picture know what will happen next, and I can't discuss anything further to the few of those who haven't. But remember when I said that ""Sleeping Beauty"" is just ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" all over again? Well, that statement could best summarize my overall opinion of the picture as well as its main problem. If you've seen ""Snow White"", you've technically seen ""Sleeping Beauty"", too. In other words, there is very little that's new here. The two main aspects about this film that do stand out for me is the musical score and the animation style. George Bruns did a masterful job with executing the film's epic and grand musical score. Amongst the film's most soothing and healing songs are ""Once Upon a Dream"", ""One Gift"", and the title tune. The animation and backgrounds in this picture really take advantage of the widescreen process and make you feel as if you're seeing a medieval painting unfold right in front of you. While ""Sleeping Beauty"" does work very well on a visual and audio level, its story and characters fall hopelessly flat. The only interesting characters for me were the three good fairies. It's not because two of them are fighting over which color will suit the princess best. It's not even because they're the characters that get the most focus. It's because they have personality. I like that we can see their struggles with not using their magic especially when they've been so dependent on their wands. Merryweather is the notable standout for me because of just how blunt she is and how she seemingly speaks her mind. I know many people freak out over Maleficent as a Disney villain and consider her one of the best villains put out by the studio. One can definitely see her enjoyment over what she's doing when she's on screen. In my opinion, she COULD be a great villain if only she were given more screen time. As it is though, the quality of Maleficent as a character basically summarizes the picture in a nutshell. The potential is there, but all I can ask afterwards is this. Is that it? Is that all we've got? One of the most critical flaws of ""Sleeping Beauty"" is Aurora herself. I am absolutely astonished that in this 75-minute picture, no more than 20% of screen time is devoted to her. I know that a certain event in the story has to happen because it's part of the original tale, so I won't complain about that plot point. But couldn't the writers have given more screen time to her beforehand? I guess they had more interest in developing the good fairies more so than Aurora, because it's something they hadn't done before. It still doesn't excuse a major character in the story from barely being on screen. The prince is probably the best developed out of the three Disney princess movies made while Walt was alive (""Snow White"", ""Cinderella"", and ""Sleeping Beauty""). It isn't saying much, since the others were barely present in the other films to start with. By the way, nice going on Aurora's parents, guys. I'm sure I'll somehow remember the brief 5-7 minutes they appeared on screen. At least I remembered King Hubert for when he was screen for more than 10 minutes. Way to pay attention to detail. More than anything else though, it is the inexplicable amount of time given to the title character that really kills the potential that ""Sleeping Beauty"" had. Save for one song, the film's music is simply sensational. I highly endorse the animation style and the atmosphere that Disney's animators created. I even think that the three good fairies have enough character to them that they almost deserve to have as much time as they ended up having. The film, however, just doesn't work on a writing level. And that frustrates me because Walt Disney and his narrative crew are known to be some of the greatest storytellers the film industry had ever seen. Perhaps I won't know why Disney and his crew felt that the decisions they made with the narrative were or weren't the right ones. All I can say is that ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a definitive example of style over substance."
17,Sleeping Beauty,10,4 May 2014,A visual masterpiece,"Sleeping Beauty (1959) is not strong on story, I will admit. It embellishes little on top of the fairy tale and outside of the fairies and Maleficent (truly one of the greatest villains in classic film) none of the characters manage to rise above being mere ciphers. Still, this is among the greatest of Disney films for its sheer visual gorgeousness.The animation is exquisite to say the least. The backgrounds, though they have their detractors like animation historian Michael Barrier, fit the more angular, jewel-colored characters in my opinion. They look so good on their own that you would not mind framing them on a wall at home. Tchaikovsky's music from the ballet Sleeping Beauty is beautifully adapted into the musical numbers and background scoring.Not for people looking for emotional depth, but for those who aren't adverse to style over substance films, this is excellent stuff. It's an epic masterpiece."
18,Sleeping Beauty,9,21 October 2013,Once upon a Disney Classic!,"This is another classic from Walt Disney, a story about a princess who was placed on a sleeping spell from a snubbed, vengeful witch, Maleficent, in which only a prince can break.This movie has beautiful animation work, rich in color and very vibrant. I loved the artwork design of the castle, which served as an inspiration of the Sleeping Beauty castles you see in Disney theme parks around the world. The characters are memorable, especially the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merriweather, who will suspend reality with magic they use like making a cottage clean by itself and counterattacking Maleficent's wicked tricks. Maleficent, I think, is one of the more notorious, yet memorable Disney villains. Prince Phillip was one of the Disney princes that actually takes on a more active role in a movie, as opposed to the more obscure princes in Snow White and Cinderella. And, the King and Queen gave an emblematic representation of what royalty typically looks like: gold crowns with flowing garbs, headdresses and capes, sitting on tall thrones. The music is superb, an adaptation of the Sleeping Beauty Ballet from Peter Tchaikovsky. The Waltz sung by Princess Aurora is my favorite piece in the movie. And, the story is fast-paced with an exciting rescue-the-princess and sword-wielding climax.The only downsides I think exists in this movie is that Princess Aurora (the Sleeping Beauty) had too little screen time and too much focus was on the Three Fairies. Also, it is said in the story that the King and Queen wanted badly to have a child. So, when Princess Aurora was born, the joy of having a child was short-lived because Aurora was taken into hiding by the fairies to escape Maleficent's curse; therefore, it is like the King and Queen got a raw deal out of this. But, other than that, a very satisfying movie that remains one of my favorite Disney classics.Grade A-"
19,Sleeping Beauty,9,6 February 2008,Such a wonderful Disney classic.,"Not insulting Disney, this just does not seem like a Disney film. There are many scary scenes (which are likely to disturb anyone aged under 9 or so) and there are many scenes that will make much more sense to adults than to children. There are also many references to what life was like in the Medieval ages (not counting the fantasy scenes of course), including the fact that it was quite normal (or even a little late) for girls to marry when they are 16. In none of Disney's other films is there this kind of reference.Aside of these points, there is stunning Disney charm, animation, humour for just about everyone and this film also includes pieces from Tchaicovsky's ballet. The characters and plot of course also help make up this wonderful animated film. The only negative point is the fact that it strays quite far from the original fairy tale, but in some cases this is not really a bad thing.You may know the story already. A baby girl is born to a king and queen and three good fairies bless the child with a gift. Although - at first it is only two. Just as the third fairy is about to bless her gift, the bad fairy Malecifent gives the baby a bad gift, that she will die on her 16th birthday. The good fairy helps turn this around, but only in a little way...Recommended to anyone who likes the fairytale, the ballet or the princess stuff of ""Sleeping Beauty"". Enjoy! :-)"
20,Sleeping Beauty,5,27 August 2010,Disney Imitates Disney....,"Disney's animation projects appeared to be running out of steam in this warmed over, under the radar imitation of ""Snow White"". The animation world had changed dramatically in the 22 years since Disney first delved into features. This one, while charming and darkly scary to some, was a bit of a bore for me. I could never really get ""Snow White"" out of my head. The similarities in the stories should have been enough to tell Walt to let it go...and let someone else do this one. Snow White had a Prince who kissed her and broke the spell...so does Sleeping Beauty. Wicked Witches? Both stories have one. But the first time was the best time, and in this film Disney had no real message. As for Fairy Godmothers...Cinderella had one...and he cast some of the same people over and over again to add to the monotony. Verna Felton comes to mind. She was a familiar figure on TV by now, as well as having been a familiar and identifiable voice on radio in the 40s with Judy Canova as well as Eve Arden...amongst others. Snow White and Sleeping Beauty both survived murder plots against them. Both were of royal blood...the similarities are striking. As I watched the making of this feature in the short film afterwards, I wondered how Walt could look into the camera with a straight face and claim anything new or strikingly original about this film. The technology had advanced, of course...but none of it was his...or very little of it. It was shot on 70mm film because the film world was being choked to death by TV, and processes such as Cinemascope were coming into play in a vain effort to recapture the once captive theater audience that would never again be captive. The film was successful and Walt made his money...but that was largely marketing...he had something now that he did not have when Snow White was in theatrical release...and that was the millions of baby-boomers who were not yet born when Snow White was made. But a lot of them would see Snow White, and would voice the same similarities at one point or another that are being voiced here. Not to take anything away from Disney...his encounters early on in his career had sharpened his business sense. But, for me, Sleeping Beauty is more an entertainment vehicle and a money maker, and not one of the truly innovative Disney films. In fact, as animation became more and more condensed as the 60s came around, Disney, as well as his animation counterparts in other arenas, would come to rely more upon development of characters as real animation was thrown to the four winds. This feature was made just prior to the animation low point in which Disney films would languish until the late 1980s or early 90s, when interest in animation would be revitalized. I can say no more about Sleeping Beauty other than some may find entertainment value in it. But I prefer Snow White over Sleeping Beauty any day of the week."
21,Sleeping Beauty,,18 September 2015,"""Now, Father, you're living in the past. This is the 14th Century!""","Classic Disney fairy tale adaptation about a princess named Aurora who is cursed by an evil witch named Maleficent. Lovely in every way with memorable characters and scenes that have stood the test of time. The animation is beautiful and stylish with rich, vibrant colors. The voice actors all do wonderful work. If I had a complaint, it would be that the narrator is rather bland. Someone with a stronger voice would have been better. But it's a minor thing in a film that is so wonderful from start to finish. The Tchaikovsky music is amazing and the song ""Once Upon a Dream"" is a real gem. I'm no film historian but it seems like, in many ways, this movie represents the end of an era for animated Disney films that began with Snow White in 1937. There would certainly be some great movies to come, even some classics, but they wouldn't have quite the same grand feeling and charming old-fashioned qualities of the films from this era."
22,Sleeping Beauty,8,8 October 2014,Excellent Animation and Gothic Overtones,"The evil sorceress Maleficent places a curse on Princess Aurora after being slighted by the royal family. She will die by pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel before her 16th birthday. The king puts his daughter in the care of three fairies who take her into hiding to keep the tragedy from occurring. Maleficent becomes obsessed with finding the girl and fulfilling her evil spell.I was pleasantly reminded of the dark elegance of Maleficent and the strong Gothic overtones presented in ""Sleeping Beauty."" They reminded me of the atmosphere found in the underrated ""The Black Cauldron"" and ""Hunchback of Notre Dame."" Being a fan of horror movies, I was attracted to the last quarter of the film more so than the first three."
23,Sleeping Beauty,6,18 June 2014,"And, Now, For That Magic Moment!","Favorite Maleficent Quote: ""Oh, they're hopeless. A complete disgrace to the forces of evil."" Once Upon a Dream...Does anyone here not know the story of Sleeping Beauty? Well, if they don't, then they really ought to be ashamed of themselves and promptly spanked for their ignorance.Sleeping Beauty would be Disney Studios' 16th animated feature. And, back at the time (1959), it would also be their most expensive and elaborate production ever.Set in 14th Century England, this film's story is actually a very simple and straightforward telling of the classic fairy tale, with music adapted from Tchaikovsky.At birth, Aurora, daughter of King Stefan and Queen Leah, is cursed by the wicked sorceress, Maleficent. Due to a mere oversight, accompanied by a rude remark, Aurora is destined to die, by Maleficent's words, before sundown on the day of her 16th birthday after touching the poisonous spindle of a wooden spinning wheel.And, it's only through true love's kiss that Aurora can ever hope to be saved.Ah! 'Tis so romantic! No? Suitable enough to be enjoyed by all ages, Sleeping Beauty is an awesome kaleidoscope-spectacle of some of the most impressive animation that you're ever going to see this side of CGI."
24,Sleeping Beauty,8,21 June 2013,"If not the best, maybe the most defining classic of Disney's animated features ...","My first experience with ""Sleeping Beauty"" was at the end of my 2nd grade year, the film's magic simply blew my mind, the bell rung shortly after the christening part and we never could finish the film. Coincidentally, the same year, I saw the climactic fight with the dragon in a Disney TV's special yet the second act remained a total mystery and I never thought I missed much since I was already familiar with the best bits, including the incomparable Tchaikovsky's waltz theme of the same name. But after a series of missed opportunities, I finally watched Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" all the way.Still, it wasn't that new an experience, I remember being mesmerized by the TV versions of the classic fairy-tale, I saw two when I was 9, and the story had no secret for me, especially because the two films where relatively faithful to Perrault's original book (in one of them, Aurora was actually named 'Briar Rose' and I thought it was just an artistic license). Speaking of the story, I thought it was surprisingly dark, projecting our deepest fears like being struck by a malevolent curse such as the spindle of the wheel, and living in the constant fear that it would be complete, not to mention the creepy vision of a whole town put in a comatose state for a whole century, a device that a child could easily assimilate to death.Although it deviates from the original material, ""Sleeping Beauty"" magnificently renders the sinister atmosphere of the story and one of its strongest aspects relies on the depiction of magic through the eternal opposites: good and evil. Disney's animated movies have always provided the best art-form when it came to vehicle these fantastic elements and as a result, the animation is absolutely dazzling whether it induces fear of amazement. The three fairies are magnificently characterized thanks to the wise choice of reducing their number to three and making them physically different, and Maleficent has this mix of elegance and darkness that perfectly suits her status as a Disney villain. In fact, for a Disney film, the film gets strangely explicit by always referring to the antagonism between good and evil through the devilish incarnation of Maleficent, who's more than your usual Witch.And perhaps this is the main achievement of ""Sleeping Beauty"", to exploit familiar archetypes from previous Disney classics, without recycling them. Maleficent is a class on her own and is never comparable to the Evil Queen from ""Snow White"" and the three fairies are much more motherly and three-dimensional figures than the jolly Godmother from ""Cinderella"". ""Sleeping Beauty"" goes even further by eschewing one of the dullest archetypes from the other films: the nameless and bland Prince. This time, Philip, to name him, becomes the first truly heroic Prince of Disney, the one who really struggled to get to Aurora and bless her with a true love kiss. Released in 1959, after several years of preparation and pre-production, anyone could tell Disney wanted to make a new movie out of familiar material.Now, there are two aspects in the film that certainly divide opinions. One being the small screen-presence of Aurora, which probably suffers from the fact that the Prince, the fairies, Maleficent and even the Kings are given more preeminent roles. For some viewers, Aurora is dull, passive or under-developed at best. The second is animation, the realism of the background, the magnificent way it renders some of the most beautiful medieval paintings, and make you look at the film as a new milestone in Disney's canon, some might find it too linear or geometrical, foreshadowing the evolution of Disney's animation to a more sketchy format, and regret the most rounded aspect of Disney's previous film, the one that Disney Renaissance would resurrect with ""The Little Mermaid"".Characters and animation either support or cancel one another. I, for one, thought that the animation was perfect for the film, that ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a masterpiece on the animation level, even more impressive since the film was still hand-drawn and didn't rely on the Xerox process that would be used for ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"". Known for being the first to be shot in Technirama process, the large scope of the film allowed the team to be more perfectionism in the depiction of backgrounds whether for castles or forests, multiplying by ten the delays of production. But for what a result! I can only envy those who saw the film in a large screen; no castle has even been more frightening than Maleficent's, conveying the Gothic atmosphere the story required. The same year than Ben-Hur, Disney proved to be capable of making blockbusters, technically speaking.And the drawing plays an interesting role, by canceling the eventual blandness of Aurora. She not only is the best-looking of all Disney princesses but her facial features also suggest a strongest and most modern personality, like a younger version of Lauren Bacall. Given the role she's supposed to have in the original story, the main players being the fairies, Maleficent and the Prince, her lack of screen-presence doesn't damage her characterization at all, hell, even her smile when she's waken up isn't the same ecstatic enthusiasm than Snow White but rather looks like a clever 'here you are' wink. The four roles are fairly distributed and the best thing it did was to spare us from too much cute little animals as time-fillers.If not as revolutionary as ""Snow White"" or as popular as ""The Lion King"", the film features three classic scenes, so-defining of what Disney stood for: the magic christening, the climactic good vs. bad battle, and naturally, the magnificent kiss. ""Sleeping Beauty"" uses all the archetypes of the fairy-tales and Disney previous successes and the result is a classic masterpiece of Animation, certainly the most defining of Disney, since even the castle where Aurora lies in the highest tower became Walt Disney's all-time trademark."
25,Sleeping Beauty,8,17 June 2010,One of the best Disney animated fairy tales of all time,"I watched this when I was younger and I didn't like it. Why? There weren't enough cute, furry animals or catchy songs to hold my attention. The colours also looked faded and dull. I kept wondering why Aurora's hair looked a dirty blonde yet it was described as ""sunshine gold"". The characters seemed a little flat, and most of the dialogue went over my head.I re-watched this movie (as the 2 disc Platinum edition) nearly 18 years later and my opinion has completely changed. The animation, sound and colours have been restored to their former glory to when it was first shown in 1959. The previous editions on VHS and re-issues in the cinema were of the aged, dirty film with a deteriorating soundtrack. I felt short-changed; my opinion of the film was affected by watching the less than pristine version.I think ""Sleeping Beauty"" as a whole appeals more to adults than children. The animation is top-notch and specifically styled to look like a medieval tapestry, and the dialogue is sophisticated and fluent. The plot a little more subtle than I remembered. Maleficent's soliloquy is bone-chillingly perfect. Her plan diabolical; she intends not to kill the Prince but to imprison him so after 100 years he will awaken his princess who has not aged (!) I can't imagine a crueler fate than to know that precious time afforded by love will be stolen from you. All too often Disney villains are painted with broad comical brush strokes and it is difficult to fear them. Here, Maleficent is truly evil; intent on destroying peoples' lives on just a whim; being snubbed at a party.This also the first time Disney gave the Prince a name. He is given subtleties never before afforded to his predecessors; warmth, humour, flirtatious and witty; ""Now, Father, this is the fourteenth century..."" There are dark segments to this film that may not be appropriate for the very young, the thrilling final battle with the dragon may be too scary. In my opinion, it is one of the best sequences of good vs evil that has never been topped for sheer adrenaline (except maybe the end of ""The Little Mermaid"").True, there are problems with the film. The titular character has very little to do and little screen time. The cute animals don't sit well with the sharp, angular patterns of the backgrounds. The fairies dominate the story and perhaps more time should have been given to the interaction between Aurora and Philip.The use of Tchaikovsky's score gives the movie a timeless quality but also a more subdued feel than the rousing scores of other Disney movies e.g. Aladdin, that certainly didn't appeal to me as a child.So if you didn't like this movie initially, I urge you to watch it again in its restored format. I felt I was watching it for the first time."
26,Sleeping Beauty,8,11 April 2010,Some enchanted movie,"For some reason, there's a whole swathe of classic 40's and 50's Disney classics I've not yet seen, including ""Cinderella"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Dumbo"", ""Bambi"", ""101 Dalmations"", ""The Lady & The Tramp"" and up until now, this lovely, warming re-telling of the classic ""love conquers all"" fairy tale.It's a long time since I've sat so rapt by a movie, an animated one at that, my eyes and ears never leaving the screen, even knowing as we all do, how the story ends. Delightfully old-fashioned, no doubt reflecting the solid family values of Eisenhower's late 50's America, I'll take ""Sleeping Beauty""'s wide-eyed innocence to today's knowing, post-modern cynicism and I speak as a fan of the whole ""Shrek"" franchise! Only once did I detect the encroachment of the modern, with references to ""this is the fourteenth century, you know!"", but this was only the mildest of jarrings if I'm being honest.The animation is delightful, particularly the backgrounds and there are some particularly eye-catching segments, two I particularly liked being the three good fairies' transformation into pixie-size and one of Malificent's entrances where she's reduced to a set of eye-slits and green light.Tchaikovsky's orchestral music is lovely, although some of the songs are a little starchy plus there's a bit too much of the young lovers' royal fathers if I'm carping, but with its gentle humour (""make it pink, make it blue"") and sheer Disney magic firmly in place, this delightful movie will waft all but the coldest heart to a lovely place long ago and far away."
27,Sleeping Beauty,8,7 October 2006,Chlidhood Favorite,"When I was a little kid, there was one movie I loved more than any other: Sleeping Beuaty. I don't remember when I first saw it, but I do remember that I loved it beyond all reason. In fact I used to bring it up so much it drove my family crazy. Today I'm not so obsessed with it, but ""Sleeping Beuaty"" still holds a special place in my heart.There are several reasons as to why I love this film. One is the animation. The whole picture is practically a medieval tapestry come to life. Another reason is the music; Thcovsky's score is truly a marvel to listen to. And the last reason is *possible spoiler* the film's villain:Maleficent! Once you see this Sorceress in action you will truly appreciate a well done villain. For these reasons and more, ""Sleeping Beuaty"" is a masterpiece that you will want to add to you're collection."
28,Sleeping Beauty,10,12 December 2005,One of Disney's finest pictures ever.,"Sleeping Beauty is arguably the best Disney Film, ever. It for me comes joint first with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1936) and heres why.Apart from the amazing scenery and beautiful bewitching score, like all of Disney films, its the voices of the actors that made the characters come alive. Maleficent (voiced by Elanor Audley) was terrifying. Everywhere on the internet this is said. She wins online competitions all the time for being the most frightening, and she is. In fact, so scary at times (much more when I was small) that I would simply have to watch her, like I was scared yet had to see what happened. That's powerful for an animated film.Sleeping Beauty is among the best animated films around, Pixar have more funny one liners and great graphics, but wheres the magic?"
29,Sleeping Beauty,9,11 September 2015,One of Disney's finest achievements,"This movie is triumphant in every sense of the word. And unique in many ways. Its artwork is not only different from everything that Disney did (before and after) but also stylish, delivering the medieval feeling it is supposed to. It took a long time to make this movie, even for the standards of animated movies. And it was a very expensive one to make either. But it was worth it. It is unquestionably one of Disney's most charming classics. It's majestic, charismatic, brilliant, funny when it has to be funny and spectacularly dark when it has to be dark.The music is nice, from the 1890 ""Sleeping Beauty ballet"" by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to the theme ""Once upon a dream"".The characters are memorable, such as King Stefan and King Hubert, Queen Leah, Princess Aurora, Prince Philip, Samson the horse, the 3 good fairies and Maleficent.Prince Philip is perhaps my favorite Disney prince and his horse Samson is so funny. My favorite one of the 3 fairies is Merryweather because she is the funniest of the 3. Maleficent is a wicked witch or an evil fairy or simply «the mistress of all evil» as she calls herself, being one of Disney's most memorable (and sinister!) villains. She is particularly terrifying when she transforms into a dragon. The line «Now you shall deal with me, ol' prince, and all the powers from HELL» is all the more deliciously scary with the strong thunder sound it makes when she says «HELL».Title in Portugal: 'A Bela Adormecida'."
30,Sleeping Beauty,9,20 August 2015,Beautiful Disney Production Of A Wonderful Fairytale.,"When an evil witch places a curse on an infant princess that will cause her to fall into eternal sleep on her 16th birthday, her three fairy godmothers whisk her away to a life of normality and ignorance of her birthright. But can they stave off the curse when the 16th year of age arrives?It upped the ante in costing for Disney, also taking a decade to produce. The ambition was high as new techniques were being used such as rotoscoping, while the musical score is brilliantly devised from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty ballet. The story itself is a pure joy, based on Charles Perrault's ever enduring fairytale, it's awash with rich characters, led by the delightful three fairy godmothers - Flora - Fauna and Merryweather, all plumpy and sweet, while evil witch Maleficent is brilliantly produced, with a long pointy chin and devil horns on her head.There's a whole bunch of charming fun on show, as the three ladies bring the magic and potter around while gently ribbing each other, but it's with the drama where Sleeping Beauty most soars. The nightmare sequence luring Briar Rose (Princess Aurora) to the dreaded spinning wheel is unnerving, and the battle between Prince Phillip and Maleficent is exhilarating and shows the animators at their best. As for the colour? Spanking!Upon release it wasn't the roaring success Disney had hoped and planned for, but the decades since then have been very kind to Sleeping Beauty. For it's a magical film for children and adults to dreamily get lost in. 9/10"
31,Sleeping Beauty,10,14 July 2015,A Postwar Disney Classic,"When Disney produced this fairy tale based on The Sleeping Beauty by Charles Perrault and Little Briar Rose by The Brothers Grimm,it spent $6 million which made it the most expensive animated movie during its time of release during the postwar in 1959.It contains amazing musical scores and songs that were adapted from the Sleeping Beauty ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and memorable iconic characters such as Princess Aurora,Maleficent and Prince Philip.The story revolves around a young princess who was cursed a birth by an evil fairy,the baby was taken into custody by the three good fairies who took care of the her.Nevertheless,the baby still fell asleep at 16 and the evil fairy takes her into a prisoner.She could only be awakened by a kiss of a handsome prince.When the prince decides to rescue her,the evil fairy became a breathing dragon forcing a clash with the prince.This is definitely a postwar Disney classic that remains a masterpiece since it was first released more than fifty years ago.The songs,the sound and the grandeur remains magnificent despite using dated technology back then.Also,the actors/actresses who provided their voices that made many characters iconic for many years to come."
32,Sleeping Beauty,10,1 June 2014,Masterpiece.,"Sleeping Beauty, from 1959, was the final fairy tale produced by Walt Disney himself and remains one of his studio's most under-cherished works. Suffused with celestial metaphors and flights of visual fancy informed by pre-Renaissance art, the film's economical story is played for cosmic pathos and staged as pagan ritual. Stylist Eyvind Earle and background artist Frank Armitage were more or less allowed autonomy over the production and their freedom is felt in the limber, giddy stylings of the film, a far superior work than its earlier kissing cousin Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Through the startlingly jagged animation and moving cutouts of the film, Earle and Armitage's crew of animators and painters evoke an expressionistic netherworld influenced by numerous Gothic, Persian and Medieval sources. The familiar story concerns a 16- year-old beauty, Princess Aurora, who dies when she pricks her finger on the needle of a spinning wheel and is subsequently revived by the Prince Charming she was destined to marry. In her attack against Aurora, the ferocious Maleficent (Eleanor Audley) appears to take on the fairy-tale cliché itself. After the story's three fairy godmothers bestow their cosmic gifts on the baby Aurora, Maleficent curses the child with death because she wasn't invited to her über-Christening. Her bitchery is of the highest order, seductive and titanic, and she is almost postmodern for her time. Just as the film's gorgeous backdrops suggest characters trapped in suspended animation, the many colorful balls of light that frequently circle their heads hauntingly convey the filmmakers' idea of fate and love locked in a cosmic struggle."
33,Sleeping Beauty,,6 February 2012,Enchantingly simple and entertaining fairy-tale for all ages,"I'm sure I've seen this film before but for the life of me I cannot remember when. Perhaps I saw it when I was very young and not since but it is equally like that my ""memory"" of it has just been created by cultural reference points, clips and a general knowledge that it exists. Either way when I sat to watch this the other day as a man in his mid-30's it did very much feel like I was coming to the total film for the first time and I was quite surprised by how simply it engaged and entertained me.The plot is simple and will be known to all and within this telling we do pretty much go from one bit to the next with little in the way of extrapolation or development  a potential problem for older viewers looking to get into it, but it still manages to work. A big part of this is the sense of fairy tale that it delivers, because it puts you in a frame of mind suitable for this. The ""opening on a shot of a book"" start to this film has been done since many times so it is easy to overlook how effective it can be, but here it works very well and the whole film captures the feel that this opening is suggesting. The telling is lightly comic but avoids cynicism or cruel humour and instead goes for a light touch; although I do love the edge that modern cynicism gives to some films, I will concede that it was quite refreshing to have a film free of it. The broad strokes of a fairy tale are here  the good fairies are non-threatening and comic while the evil fairy is tall, lean, strict and menacing; the prince is handsome, the princess stunning etc and it does feel like being read to as a child because it is simple yet vivid in the way it is told.It is easy (and tempting) to look at the film with a cynical modern eye and criticise it for its presentation of beauty and its gender politics but, while I do believe that things like this film and Barbie and others had a major role in shaping the view of beauty, it is not a thought that occurred to me once while watching the film. Instead it charmed me to its agenda, not my own and I would suggest anyone watching this and muttering their way through it has simply not come with an open mind. The voice work perhaps lacks the character of modern animated films, but all are good in their various roles  in particular the evil fairy is strong in her presence.Overall Sleeping Beauty is considered a classic and it is so for good reason  because it is. It is the type of film that parents will want their children to see because it is simple, engaging, well presented, beautiful to look at and tells a story that has danger and evil in it while also showing the power of love and that good will always prevail. Of course this is not true  but this is a fairy tale and it takes you with it while you watch. It says something that over 50 years after this was made that a audience of all ages can sit to watch this and all come away loving it. A delight."
34,Sleeping Beauty,5,9 July 2012,Almost totally formulaic,"Sleeping Beauty is a disappointment for Disney. If it were the first animated feature ever made or even the first ""princess meets prince - falls in love - they live happily ever after"" animated feature, it would be fairly decent. But compared with Cinderella and Snow White, Sleeping Beauty falls very far behind. The animation fluidity is very smooth, an improvement on Snow White, but that is where the magic ends. The backgrounds are less detailed, the extras on the screen are given little to no movement, and the color palette is mostly primary colors. The story is one we've all heard before, but no time is invested in the characters (save for the 3 fairies...who fail to delight) to spice things up. What made the fairy tales of Snow White and Cinderella so wonderful was the attention to detail, both in animation and characters. We got to know their personalities, their motivations, their quirks. For example, the magnificently drawn villain, Malificent, is given no reason for being bad. She just comes and lays a curse upon people and creates havoc because...well, I guess she just has nothing better to do... In this movie, Disney seems to be going through the motions. Take note: more time is given to showing the storybook flipping through the pages and more narration is used to move us through the plot. Had Disney focused less on the plot and more on the characters relating to each other, the movie would have been much more interesting. There is nothing in Sleeping Beauty that is original, nothing they haven't done better earlier. Such a pity this was the last movie Walt produced before he died. It was the end of their classic era. Even the music is lacking with the Princess Aurora song and the song between the 2 kings being some of the silliest music they ever recorded. Only one great tune (The Once Upon a Dream song) stands above the rest. They clearly knew that it was their one good song since it is sung over and over again throughout the movie. So why am I giving this movie a 5 and not lower? Because it is a competent movie. It is skillfully pieced together and flows smoothly. It will be a delight to children. On its own, it is decent. It pales in comparison to other great Disney films. Sleepy Beauty is a perfect example of a skilled studio cutting corners and putting out a product without a lot of love poured into it."
35,Sleeping Beauty,10,31 July 2006,Good fairy tale; excellent movie!!!!!,"Disney heads back to the drawing board (with cels, of course) in the 1959 animated film ""Sleeping Beauty,"" which is a fairy tale of a movie about a princess who was fallen asleep from a sleeping apple, and then Prince Charming comes up and wakes her up with a big, big kiss!!!!! (Note: even though everyone knows this story, I classified this as a ""spoiler"" type review just to be safe.)What I like about this movie: I can't remember if I had seen this in whole; this played on ABC at around the same time the DVD came out here in the States. I've only seen the end part of it; that had the most important part (the kiss) and I thought it was good!!!!!Remember, this movie is on DVD (look very, very hard for it), and notice that this movie is nothing like it was a long time ago, because a whole lot of elbow grease was put into restoring the movie from start to finish, making it seem even better!!!!!""Sleeping Beauty"" - the movie guaranteed ""not"" to fall asleep to!!!!!10/10"
36,Sleeping Beauty,10,19 January 2006,Absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece,"In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, Maleficent (voice of Eleanor Audley) was truly diabolical. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, Sleeping Beauty (voice of Mary Costa) was a very beautiful lady. To me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it."
37,Sleeping Beauty,3,24 January 2005,"Not as good as Cinderella, Snow White or Other Princess Movies","One poster wrote that the movie is ""flat."" I couldn't find a better term to fit my feelings, as well. It doesn't have the charm of the other princess movies. Aurora's voice doesn't fit the character; Mary Costa has a lovely voice but it's too mature for a supposed 16 year old character. The music sounds like it's being played in a tin can. It lacks the depth and beauty of other Disney movies. The story line doesn't flow; it's choppy, at best. The colors chosen are bland; they're not as vivid as the other movies. The movie itself is dark and dreary; I'm not sure if Walt Disney did this purposely or it was an oversight.My three year old loves this movie but I find it painful to watch. Unlike Cinderella or Snow White, which I've seen about 25 times each!"
38,Sleeping Beauty,9,9 March 2006,A beautiful film & my favorite Disney villain,"I was born 5 years after the film was released.Never got to see it in a theater, even through rereleases.So, only on television & video have I experienced the film.It is beautiful!! And, Maleficent is my favorite Disney villain!! It is a classic film, not at the very top of my favorite Disney films, but close.Course, I notice a different in the colors in the film when watching the DVD on a regular DVD player & my computers DVD drive. Flora's dress FINALLY looks pink.The 9 old men of animation out did themselves with with the beauty of the film & how perfect the characters & scenery were done.Music good, not great. No songs that you can not get out of your head because they are so good.Stands the test of time.To get this positive comment to post I am inputting my comments from Snow White below:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029583/usercomments-103What can you say about this film that has not been said already.The original. A true classic film.Still as beautiful to look at today.Wonderful music. ""The Silly Song"" is my favorite.Great characters. Dwarfs. Dopey & Grumpy are my favorites.The Evil Queen is my 2cd favorite Disney Villain behind Maleficent.I prefer the Evil Queen to her alter ego the Old Hag.""Heigh Ho"".Voices for the characters were perfect. Too bad now most everyone who worked on the film has passed on.Films are NOT made of this quality anymore. Way too bad.""I'm Wishing""."
39,Sleeping Beauty,9,24 November 2014,The end of an era,"The 1950's were tumultuous years for the Walt Disney Company. Cinderella was a huge hit when it was released in 1950 and was so profitable for the company that they were able to release a string of classic features and were also able to create Disneyland, which opened in 1955. Due to the fact that Walt Disney had a lot of things on his mind during the second half of the 1950's, he wasn't involved as much in the production of Sleeping Beauty as he was in the earlier Disney classics. It took a decade to finish what would be the last classic of Disney's Golden Era. Sleeping Beauty was known as the most expensive animated feature of all time when it was released in 1959. Unfortunately, Sleeping Beauty did not do well at the Box Office and received mixed reviews from critics upon its release.Based on the fairytale by The Brothers Grimm 'Little Briar Rose', Sleeping Beauty is a medieval story about princess Aurora (voiced by Mary Costa), who gets cursed by the evil Maleficent (voiced by Eleanor Audley). Before the sun sets on her 16th birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The fairy Merrywheater uses her blessing for the princess to change the curse. Instead of dying, Aurora will fall asleep and can only awake by true love's first kiss. Aurora grows up as Briar Rose with the three fairies; Flora, Fauna and Merrywheater in order to guarantee her safety from the evil Maleficent. She doesn't know that she's a princess, until the day of the 16th birthday, after she's met Prince Philip, without being aware he's a prince. When she returns to the cottage where she and the fairies live, she tells them about the prince, but the fairies have to tell her she can't see the boy anymore, because she's Princess Aurora. She needs to return to the castle of her parents. Aurora gets tricked by Maleficent and touches the spindle of a spinning wheel. The fairies cast a spell on all the inhabitants of the kingdom to make sure they are all asleep. Maleficent kidnaps Prince Philip, who was attempting to pay Briar Rose a visit in the cottage. The fairies manage to help Philip escape from Maleficent, but Maleficent attempts to stop him from reaching Aurora. She turns into a dragon, but Philip manages to stab her in the heart with a sword. Maleficent dies and Philip kisses Aurora, so she wakes up and they marry.Sleeping Beauty may not be the best Disney Classic of all time, but it's one of my personal favorites. The animation is as good as it has ever been in any of the Disney films. The costs were high, but the result is mind-blowing. The music is really good and works perfectly well within the theme of the film. The main characters aren't very interesting, especially Briar Rose (Aurora). She only gets about 20 minutes of screen time, which is strange for a main character. That's definitely a flaw. On top of that, she isn't very interesting. Her singing voice is boring, which is evident in the long scene where she meets Prince Philip (voiced by Bill Shirley). This scene is one of the weakest moments in Sleeping Beauty. Aside from that scene, Aurora doesn't bother me that much, though. The other characters are far more interesting. Maleficent is a fantastic villain. She's evil and malicious. That's what a villain is supposed to be. Her design is perfect as well. She looks evil, but beautiful at the same time. There's always a mysterious aura surrounding her. Eleanor Audley also voiced 'Lady Tremaine' in Cinderella, another great Disney villain. Her voice work for Maleficent works perfectly. Philip is a lot better developed than most of the Disney princes, but in the final part of the film, where he escapes from Maleficent and awakes Aurora, he doesn't say a word which feels a little odd. The two kings, Hubert (Philip's father) and Stefan (Aurora's father) are pretty funny and share a good deal of chemistry. Their scenes might be filler since they don't add much to the plot, but I do enjoy them so I never had a problem with them. The three fairies are great characters. They all have different personalities. I especially like Merrywheater, who's goodhearted but can also lose her temper. The fairies really add up to the overall quality of the film. With the exception of the long scene where Aurora meets Philip for the first time, everything in Sleeping Beauty works for me. The animation alone would be worthy of a view, because it's simply perfect and will never be topped. Sleeping Beauty is the culmination of Disney's Golden Era and can be called a masterpiece."
40,Sleeping Beauty,10,17 September 2014,Magical,"As a kid this was among my top favorite Disney movies! So many things in there were amazing while others didn't quite work well.The art is amazing! It's not like anything Disney ever did before. It looks like Medieval tapestry and it's just brilliant. When I look at the hall of the king, the courts, or the forest I keep thinking that I'm seeing actual artwork and not just moving cartoon characters from pencil sketches. I'm serious when I say the background pictures ought to be in a museum one day; they're just that good!The music, I love it! They're catchy, memorable, and beautiful. When I say ""catchy"" I don't mean that they have a beat from rock 'n roll or anything like that, in fact nothing in the movie is modern related, it's all a Medieval setting. And in comparison to recent Disney movies, that says a lot! I haven't seen the original ballet, but I've heard that this is where the music came from or is based off of. I still sing Once Upon a Dream a lot, which is still one of my favorite songs. The characters (most of them) are just memorable. The fairies are my favorites. In fact I compare them to my two sisters and I because of their personalities matching ours (older: leader-like, middle: gentle and kind, youngest: feisty and defensive). Fauna is still my favorite fairy mostly because she and I have so much in common, including that we like green and are gentle. Maleficent is a great villainess! I won't falter that. She's just a great sorceress and sometimes it can be hard to tell if she'll take bad news well or furiously and how extreme she'll react. The fact that she can also turn into a dragon is scary! Her magic is also scary. If you get on her wrong side, then she could kill you off. How frightening is that?The main flaw I have with the movie are the main characters. I'll start with Prince Philip. Before The Little Mermaid, Disney seemed to stereotype guys in a Disney Princess movie to just be the bold, singing, say nothing hero. After about the second half of the movie he says nothing. All he does is play the dashing hero with the sword, and don't get me wrong, the fight scene is intense and amazing, but wouldn't you want to hear him say something after 30 minutes of him talking in the middle of the film? Now we get the Princess herself, Aurora. She was my favorite princess, but the problem was the story is called Sleeping Beauty and we see less of her ironically (not counting when she's asleep) and more of the fairies. Shouldn't this be renamed The Three Fairies? I like her, but she should have been the focus of the movie rather than the fairies, the kings, and other side characters.I still love this film. It has it's flaws, but most of the time it is a colossal epic and worth watching."
41,Sleeping Beauty,10,11 September 2013,The Queen of Animated Movies,"I haven't seen this movie since I was kid. A random pic I've found on the net from the movie though reminded me of it and I was curious how I'll enjoy it after so many years passed so I got a copy of it and sit down to watch it. What I had to realize is that not only I enjoy it as much as I did back then but I'm actually enjoying it even more. The movies biggest advantage is simply this: It's unbelievably gorgeous!The music, the backgrounds, the colors, the character animation, everything. Its as if every single scene in this movie was created with the explicit purpose to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible. Its art style I think is very special. Instead of the cartoonish look they went for realism. Upon the extremely detailed backgrounds we get extremely detailed characters who(especially Aurora and Malificent) make even the otherwise impressive looking characters of other Disney movies look like Powerpuff Girls. On the other hand the movie is also stylized to resemble medieval art which gives the movie a very unique atmosphere I think. The medieval style isn't only applicable to the art however. The songs and even some of the dialog I think were written in a way to make you feel as if you were listening to some kind of bardic story told through music and poetic language rather than watching a movie.On top of this the movie also has a very unique dreamlike quality. Its kinda hard to explain but this is what really made me fall in love with it(twice now). I'll try to explain it: On one hand they went for realism but they also made these surreal magical effects produced by the four fairies sorcery( or three fairies and one witch, I was never quite sure). Now the thing is that the transition from realistic to surreal is very subtle and the two elements end up bleeding together producing the dreamlike atmosphere. This is also true with the light and dark duality. The good fairies and Aurora represent good, light, joy, innocence and things like that with their design, colors, sound effects, voices and magical effects while Malificent is representing dark, dread, sorrow, violence and you know all the dark stuff again with her design, colors, sound effects, voice, and magical effects. And the thing is that all of this is bleeding and mixing together too so we not only have a dreamlike movie but also a bittersweet and dreamlike movie which resembles a bardic tale with musical and poetic elements stylized to resemble medieval art. All that in a single movie!Now here is the part where I'd talk about the music but IMO thats kinda unnecessary. Its Tchaikovsky. Enjoy it. Paired with these visuals that's the only thing you can do. I really like the songs too again partly because they feel right for the setting. My favorites are ""I wonder"" and ""Once upon a dream"" because I think Auroras/Marys heavenly voice is very hard to top. I really wish they gave her more songs.Now I read some opinions about it that criticizes things like characters and story. No. Simply no. This movie isn't about that! If you try to logic your way through it you are completely missing the point. What this movie tries to do is retelling one of the most basic fantasy stories you can think of using its impressive audiovisual tools and symbolism. It doesn't try to make you think it tries to make you feel. You know like pieces of art used to do. Odyssey or Hamlet or the picture about a naked woman standing on a giant seashell while being surrounded by flying humanoids don't make any sense either if you try to think about them too hard. Does this mean that they are worthless?So my advice is to try to appreciate this movie for what it is. Nothing is perfect but as far as animated movies go I think this one is the closest to it. So I hereby crown Sleeping Beauty as the Queen of Animated Movies with a perfect 10/10 score! You think its too high? Show me better!"
42,Sleeping Beauty,10,7 December 2012,Spellbinding Disney masterpiece!,"Everyone knows the classic fairy tale of SLEEPING BEAUTY. A beautiful princess is cursed to a long sleep by a wicked fairy, and can only be awakened by the kiss of true love. Luckily, a prince comes, kisses her, and lives happily ever after.This is, without a doubt, one of the best films ever put out by Disney. Every time I watch it, I am bowled over by the film's artistry. The film was the first animated film to be photographed in 70mm, and it was well worth it. Evyind Earle's legendary background styling is quite magnificent, and makes good use of the widescreen. The characters are wonderful, particularly the three good fairies who try to rescue Princess Aurora, and the self-proclaimed ""Mistress of All Evil,"" Maleficent, brought chillingly to life by Eleanor Audley (who previously portrayed Cinderella's stepmother for Disney). The highlight of the film, for me, is the background music, adapted from the famous ballet of the same name by Tchaikovsky. This is easily Disney's best score, an exquisite piece of work. The quality of the recording is so crystal clear, it sounds like it was recorded yesterday, giving the orchestra a pure, lush sound. Some wonderful lyrical songs appear, enhanced by excellent choral work and the voices of Mary Costa and Bill Shirley as the Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip. I could go on and on about this movie. HIGHLY (and I do mean highly) Recommended. 10/10."
43,Sleeping Beauty,10,11 May 2010,A true timeless classic and one of Disney's finest moments.,"This is a film that was made for a big finale. And Walt Disney didn't disappoint, for this was the last fairy-tale film he supervised before the great entertainer passed in 1966. Sleeping Beauty is a film filled with captivating animation, beautiful music, and loving characters.The film starts off with the revealing of the princess Aurora and how the kingdom loved her and even the three good fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather loved the young princess. However as the fairies were giving their gifts to the princess the powerful and evil Maleficent arrives. Angry at the fact that she was not wanted at the celebration she curses the young princess to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. However with the final gift the curse is altered so that she will not die but just sleep until her true loves kiss breaks the curse.This story is filled with romance, adventure, sorrow, and even laughter. It is this movie where we meet who is probably the most devious and powerful of the Disney villains. Maleficent is scary, powerful, and is such a dark character you wouldn't believe this is actual Disney animation. But I think that's the best part of the film. Not a single thing is to childish to where you can't enjoy it. We find a world filled with enchanting characters, some of the most realistic animation I have ever seen, and a villain that makes all other Disney villains look like grunts. This is definitely one of the best animated films ever made."
44,Sleeping Beauty,9,20 November 2009,"Amazing songs, amazing design!","Sleeping Beauty was my first ever Disney film, I saw it when I was 4 years old, I loved it and still do! The songs are simply gold! 'Once Upon A Dream', sorry, but it's just one of the best songs ever made, disagree or not! 'I Wonder' is really nice too. Mary Costa has an incredible voice! The design and animation is great too! I loved how they animated Maleficent as a dragon! Outstanding! So I give it 9/10, because even though it's amazing, I wanted to see more of Auroura. But still, it's truly worth watching!So, watch Sleeping Beauty! It's pure!"
45,Sleeping Beauty,,22 January 2009,Classic Disney,"Sleeping Beauty (1959) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Disney classic about an evil fairy who puts a curse on a young princess putting her to sleep and only a prince can awaken her with a kiss. This is a pretty straight-forward film that doesn't have anything dangerous or even challenging but what it does have is some wonderful animation and some very memorable characters. I'm pretty sure I had seen parts of this when I was a kid but never the full thing until the recently released Blu-ray, which features the film in its 2.55:1 glory with a terrific transfer. Anyone having to suffer through a Pan & Scan version of this would certainly be missing a lot because this is one of the most beautiful animated films I've ever seen. I heard this was the most expensive Disney movie in its time and that's easy to see because of how much is on the screen. I'm really not sure where to start in terms of the animation and colors but I guess a good place would be when two of the fairies are fighting over what color the dress should be. The pink and blue colors are flying back and forth and the beauty of this really caught my eye. Another great sequence in terms of animation is the ending where the prince must battle the dragon. What really sticks out as well are all the wonderful characters and this includes pretty much everyone that shows up on the screen. Not only are the main characters very memorable but so are all the supporting ones. Even the animals who just have one sequence stand out with their charm. The parents of the prince and princess are wonderful as well and there's certainly nothing more charming than the three good fairies. I'm not sure if a stronger or more complicated story would have helped or not but I'm going to guess no because the simple nature of the film is something that makes this very charming."
46,Sleeping Beauty,10,28 November 2007,Beautiful.,"""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of Disney's best movies as well as one of their most beautiful. The animation is stunning, the song ""Once Apon A Dream"" is gorgeous and the voice acting is superb.The Story: Aurora is the beautiful daughter of a king and queen. On the day of her birth, three good fairies (Flora, Fauna and Merryweather) come to bless her with beauty and song, but along comes bad fairy Maleficent (who was voted #1 of Disney's top 30 Villains), puts a curse on Aurora that she'll die on her 16th birthday when she pricks her finger on a spinning wheel. Merryweather counters the curse that, instead of dying, Aurora will simply sleep until true love's first kiss breaks the spell. That is, her fiancé Prince Phillip has to kiss her. The fairies end up fostering Aurora, much to the grief of the king and queen, for protection and change her name to Briar Rose, again for protection. However, the curse takes place on Aurora/Briar Rose's 16th birthday. The fairies put everyone else in the kingdom to sleep and free Phillip after Maleficent holds him prisoner. Now Phillip has to play the hero and save the day with the help of the fairies.I highly recommend this movie, especially if you want some of Disney's classic gold, much unlike the CGI that's being made nowadays. It's another childhood favourite and both kids and adults will fall under the spell of the movies audacious narrative style, animation, songs and humour."
47,Sleeping Beauty,10,1 August 2007,Another Masterpiece and my top favorite from Disney,"This film is another Disney masterpiece, and I really enjoyed it. I've always love fairy tales and even as an adult, I still love them. ""Sleeping Beauty"" is one of my favorite fairy tales from Charles Perrault, along with ""Cinderella"" and ""Puss n' Boots.""I'd love the scenery, it's like stepping through a magic tapestry and going back in time to the Middle Ages. I'd also love the color-styling of Eyvind Earle, and this film was the reason Eyvind Earle became one of my favorite artists. This film has an excellent musical soundtrack with additional music from Peter Tchaikovsky's ""Sleeping Beauty"" ballet; I have the whole score on records. This film has a top-notch voice acting like : · Mary Costa...Princess Aurora/Briar Rose, · Bill Shirley...Prince Phillip, · Eleanor Audley...Maleficent, · Barbara Luddy...Merryweather, the Blue Fairy, and... · Bill Thompson...King Hubert (Philip's Dad.So watching this movie is definitely worth watching; I give Sleeping Beauty two big thumbs up!"
48,Sleeping Beauty,,16 September 2004,A love-hate relationship,"I was 13 years old when Sleeping Beauty came out, and was very disappointed in the artwork. Even though we have the video, I seldom watch it all the way through. Tonight I did, and with years of studying cartoonists, styles, I am more disappointed than ever. The ""medieval"" style is not consistent throughout the movie. It's almost as if each scene had a different lead artist. Sometimes it's stylistic with Hanna-Barbera animation, sometimes naturalistic (dungeon walls), sometimes classic Disney, sometimes it has the psychedelic beauty of Fantasia, my favorite Disney movie!I DO love the music, which has more to do with Tchaikovsky than Disney. I certainly think the Disney writers provided a livelier and more exciting story line than the original, including condensing the good fairies down to three.SOME SPOILERS FOLLOWAnd I have certain favorite scenes, that will bring me running back into the room when someone else is watching it. I love the ""Once Upon a Dream"" scene with the animals pretending to be the prince. I think the battle of the dress colors is classic original Disney. The fact that it defies simple logic which would be to use both colors, makes it that much sillier and that much more tragic when the fairies accidentally reveal their hiding place (they never thought to close the flue on the fireplace). I LOVE the battle with the dragon!For me, each Disney movie has its charms and disappointments - but I'm glad I sat through Sleeping Beauty one more time!"
49,Sleeping Beauty,9,22 November 2003,Fantastic!,"The old cliche, ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" is certainly true here.  I grew up on Disney animation in the 70s-90s and even today.  I used to think Disney has pretty good animation.  I'd never seen anything from them as old as this movie.  The animation is SO MUCH SMOOTHER and more realistic than the stuff Disney cranks out today.  You can actually take the villain in this movie seriously, as opposed to the ""gnashing teeth"" villains in today's Disney movies.  Everything today has been so watered down and ""PC"" that the scary edge is gone.Disney, take a clue from your old work.  Sleeping Beauty is enjoyable by both kids and adults, yet doesn't need subtle references to adult topics in order to maintain that enjoyability.This easily ranks 9/10."
50,Sleeping Beauty,10,17 June 2002,one of the Disney Greats,"This is one of the best Disney film ever.  It has a great story, it is not to sappy, and it has the best villainess, that Disney has ever created. Maleficent, the witch, is without a doubt, one of the best villains of any movie or TV show.  She takes her place right among Catwoman and Kathy Bates in Misery. If she were not the villain, the movie wouldn't be half what it is."
51,Sleeping Beauty,10,16 November 2000,The last of the great Disney romantic films.,"I saw this theatrically, twice at time-of-release, and then decades later in re-release. The rich tapestry of animation, plot, and marvelous Tschiakovsky music make this mandatory viewing and listening for all except the very young. I recall at the time missing the original and lush Disney-style animation I had grown up with. Having seen ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Fantasia"", ""Dumbo"", ""Cinderella"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", and all the other Thirties-Forties Disney Studios classics, ""Sleeping Beauty"" uses a somewhat more sparse and flat look then in vogue with avant-garde animators. In retrospect, however, I think the 'look' of ""Sleeping Beauty"" has held up well, unlike many of the experimental super-minimalist animation efforts of that time. Background artist Eyvind Earle had said he was attempting a 'primitive' look, with emphasis on vertical and horizontal lines, in the manner of Botticelli but with Persian and Japanese influences. (Notice that the trees are squared.) Looking back, this creativity does lend a mood of fantasy and surrealism, in order with the theme.If I missed the ""Bambi"" look in 1959, however, today I miss the ""Sleeping Beauty"" look, and sound, among all the recent Disney efforts!
This really was the end of an era at Disney, a 'serious' and romantic story with glorious songs and music. Here Disney once again elevated his audience, giving us immortal music with a full chorus and the incomparable voice of Mary Costa (and compare to the feeble, forgettable tunes and 'pop'-style singers of recent Disney offerings). See and hear ""Sleeping Beauty"" and remember how it was before the 'knack' was seemingly lost. Highly recommended. ****"
52,Sleeping Beauty,8,18 September 2016,"Ageless, Sleeping Beauty","One of the most famous (and beautiful) adaptations of the classic Grimm fairy tale, ""Sleeping Beauty"" remains a Disney masterpiece. Funny, romantic, scary and magical, this animated film creates an enchanting picture of Medieval Europe (probably Germany) that resembles the Gothic artistic movement, enriched with music inspired by Tchaikovsky's ballet. ""Sleeping Beauty"" touches themes such as love, hope and the perennial battle between the forces of Good and Evil. Although it is not similar to the latest Disney films that present independent, emancipated women, it is, nonetheless, an exciting artistic creation that has received a place among the films that comprise the Golden Age of the cinematic (animation) world."
53,Sleeping Beauty,7,3 December 2014,old fashion Disney classic,"King Stefan and Queen Leah finally has a child, Princess Aurora. At her christening, she is betrothed to boy Prince Phillip, the heir to neighboring King Hubert. The three good fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather bless the child with gifts. Before Merryweather gives her blessing, the evil fairy Maleficent interrupts and curses the princess with death before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday as she pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel. Merryweather uses her blessing to alter the curse to a deathlike sleep from which she can be awakened by true love's kiss. The three fairies comes up with a scheme to turn into humans and raise the girl as their own.This is definitely an old fashion fairy tale where the princess is rescued by her prince. The songs are old fashion but 'Once Upon a Dream' is still great. The hand drawn animation is beautiful. Maleficent is a great villain. The three fairies aren't nearly funny enough. Nevertheless this is a classic although it is of its times."
54,Sleeping Beauty,7,8 December 2013,Widescreen Animated Film,"Walt Disney's first widescreen animated film is a variation on the ""Snow White"" legend, as Princess Aurora is cursed by evil witch queen Maleficent to die before her 16th birthday by pricking her finger on a spindle wheel. To prevent this, her father the King sends her into the care of three good but bumbling fairy godmothers who raise her, but are still unable to prevent the curse, though Aurora's love Prince Philip will revive her with a kiss, if he can first survive the trap set for him by Maleficent, and then battle her when she transforms herself into a huge dragon. Superbly animated film with a most vivid climax. Story may not be original, but will hold children spellbound, and remains entertaining for adults."
55,Sleeping Beauty,7,9 April 2011,Dinsey classics are always great!,"The first ""princess"" classic I've seen. Definitely has the classic drama of some evil witch or person (female, really?) who tries to ruin the classic story. Almost does so, then someone, typically insignificant people, come over and save the day, and then the princess is happy.This is just that case. Someone who is a princess and someone who is a prince. They both were planned on getting married, one gets a curse. Then they hide. The evil person does what they can to stop them from succeeding. Then something good happens. That's the story of sleeping beauty.I rate this a 7/10 only for a few reasons. First, the story confused me a bit, I never did understand what she was cursed with, why the witch was evil at all, etc. Second, I thought it was rather interesting how the fairies said that the prince cannot be helped by magic, yet that's the thing they did to help the prince. I thought it was intentional, and the fairies would learn not to break their promises, but I guess it didn't get noticed.Anyhow, it's rated 7/10, but it is STILL a good classic. :)"
56,Sleeping Beauty,8,12 August 2010,A nostalgic masterpiece,"This film is a lot like its princess  sweet, beautiful to look at and listen to, has nothing particularly profound to say but is a lovely presence nonetheless.John Grant notes in The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney Characters that when it was released, the film disappointed critics expecting another Snow Whiter or Cinderella, as well as those hoping for something new. On the one hand, the films follow the same basic formula  a demure princess, an ineffectual prince, an elegant villainess, and bumbling troupe of supporting characters who end up saving the day. But things aren't quite the same. Aurora may be as innocent as Snow White but her blonde beauty suggests a Cinderella. Philip and Snow White's prince have the same approach to picking up girls, but Philip does more for his damsel than provide a well-timed kiss, and he acts a good deal more like a smug teenager than his predecessors. Maleficent (voiced by the same actress who voiced Cinderella's stepmother) might be described as the evil queen but with a sense of humor (albeit a sadistic one).So it didn't generate as much love as its predecessors. And how about now? Is it too sexist? Sure, a raging feminist could have a field day pointing out what's wrong with the film's weak-willed princess who perpetually dreams of romance. To stamp this film as ""sexist,"" however, ignores that the central conflict is between women  older women, in fact! All the other characters are essentially pawns on the chess board where Maleficent and the three good fairies battle. It doesn't help matters, of course, that the three good fairies are so saccharine and grandmotherly. Up until about three-quarters through the film, the three sprites do not seem competent enough to bake a cake, let alone slay a dragon. But then there's Maleficent. Wow. She's so frightening as a gaunt sorceress that her magnificent transformation into a smiling, slithering dragon seems almost redundant. It's hard to be completely at ease at any point in the film, knowing that Maleficent might be hiding in the fireplace or in the cottage, watching and waiting. That she could be all this and still be such a magnetic, sexy character serves as justification enough for adults to watch and enjoy this film.There's a chance Sleeping Beauty will fade away as a kid's movie. Parents of the future might hide it away, not wanting their daughters to start floating around the house singing about the boys at their preschool. Children of the future might find it too scary, or maybe even too boring. Given the loud, fast-paced nature of modern kid's films, it's hard to imagine the scene where Aurora sings an aria as she strolls through the woods making the cut.So while fading away may be inevitable, I really hope that doesn't happen. Criticisms aside, this film is a masterpiece. The same impulse that compelled Disney to pair classical music with experimental animation in Fantasia seems to inspire Sleeping Beauty. The animation is unlike anything before or after  much more like a moving tapestry than a Saturday morning cartoon. Aurora and Maleficent may be the two most graceful women in animation, and they are truly pleasure to watch. They move as gracefully as ballet dancers, unsurprisingly since the music comes from Tchaikovsky's ballet. There are parts of Fantasia that just don't work, and it's nearly impossible to get a kid to sit through the whole thing. But here, it works. Perhaps because Sleeping Beauty is a coherent story rather than a series of sequences, although it has more than a few jokey or ostentatiously animated sequences that don't move the plot an inch. Mostly, it works because the animation and the music complement each other beautifully, the one making the other romantic or haunting as the story dictates.But what does this story really ""mean""? Again, nothing profound. Be kind. Be brave. Stamp out evil where you can. This is a Disney film, after all. But it's a lovely one, and in a culture where a forgettable cartoon film seems to be churned out every month, I applaud the effort to create a film that is at once a work of art and children's entertainment. So maybe one day it will be considered more of a feat of animation than a great film for the kids. I just hope it doesn't slip away entirely."
57,Sleeping Beauty,7,28 December 2009,The Sleeping Beauty has woken up again,"Last year, with the release of the Platinum Edition of «Sleeping Beauty», my curiosity for the film woke up, cause it's was a while since I last time saw it. I bought the new DVD and got a pleasant re-acquaintance with «Sleeping Beauty». I won't call it my favorite Disney classic of all time, but it's definitively a entertaining and enchanting Disney classic for Disney-lovers to enjoy. «Sleeping Beauty» is, layer-wise, also one of Disney's most interesting films for an adult viewer, cause the film deals with pretty dark elements. I'll actually claim that adults may enjoy the film more than the kids, cause there are some really frightening scenes. I saw «Sleeping Beauty» first time when I was eight years old and it was one of the few Disney films that actually scared me. Of course if the younger kids are going to be scared depends on how easy they are to scare, but I'll still state that parents should think twice before showing this film to the youngest family members, cause some scenes, accompanied with gloomy music, are enough to make a traumatic impact on kids (speaking of which, a earlier friend of mine got scared by the dragon and didn't wanted to see the film until he grew up).In spite of «Sleeping Beauty"" being really dark, it's a pretty lighthearted film, too. There are some wonderful, classical Disney moments here, which I'm going to talk more about later. But first about the characters.The best of them are without doubt the Goodfaires, which are the most present characters too. Fauna is my personal favorite. Other likable characters are Prince Philip's father, King Hubert and the horse, Samson. To claim the two lovebirds, Prince Philip and Princess Aurora, as passive characters may be unfair, but unfortunately that's the truth. But in return, they've been given wonderful singing voices by Mary Costa and Bill Shirley. And Aurora's character design is interesting, too. Malificent, on the other hand, is one of Disney's most memorable villains and there's no reason to wonder why; With her calm, collected, but cold presence she's sure to be memorized by every child and Disney villain (and I personally think she's sort of cute too). I used to think that her monster-like helpers were quite annoying, but not anymore.As mentioned, there are many wonderful and spectacular scenes; The climatic dragon-fight is one of them, but Aurora's journey towards the spinning wheel in the castle is a chilling sequence. And the sequences with her in the woods along with all the animals and her Prince is pure Disney magic, as is all the scenes with the Three Goodfaires. The animation is beautiful and the widescreen format suites this movie well, as the Tchaikowsky-music does. It was a perfect fit for the movie, by giving it more substance and sophistication, actually. Except for ""Hail To The Princess Aurora"", the songs are quite enchanting, although they haven't been the most mentioned ones from Disney. In spite of the screenplay being quite straightforward and predictable (like you can expect from Disney at that time), there are some clever twists on the love story, which catches the interest of the viewers.So don't miss ""Sleeping Beauty"". It's a entertaining and cute film for every Disney fans to enjoy."
58,Sleeping Beauty,,12 December 2002,A Cinematic Wonder,"Just as his ""Snow White"" (1937) was a cinematic breakthrough years before, Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a masterpiece of animation. A visual wonder of vibrant color, and beautiful artwork.This feature sports some of the best characters from the studio's extensive cast. Among them, the three good fairies Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. They are humorous and endearing. The princess herself is also charming, and one of the better ones to come from the studio. Even the prince is notably better then his predecessors in ""Snow White"" (1937) and ""Cinderella"" (1950). One could say he and Aurora are equals, in that they both have developed personalities. The real star, however, is most certainly the evil Malificent, who electrifies the screen every moment she is on it.The music score is, of course, the well-known ballet, and it sounds wonderful in the film. Even the brief ""I Wonder"" and ""Once Upon a Dream"" are lovely. Memorable scenes include: the good fairies trying to prepare a birthday party without their magic, Aurora's meeting with Phillip in the forest, and the thrilling showdown between Malificent and the prince.A truly wonderful piece of art, and one of the best animated features. By all means, see it in it's full-width, stereophonic splendour."
59,Sleeping Beauty,8,13 September 2002,Disney at its best!,"This film is fantastic! The animation, especially the background designs, was completely modern for its time, and really a bold choice for the normally conservative Disney. The take on the fairy tale is also interesting. The young characters are shown as independent people, who ardently refuse to submit to an arranged marriage. I also think this is the first Disney film where the 'prince' character has...well...character! Prince Eric is not the flat, undeveloped stereotypes that are found in Snow White, Cinderella, or even to a lesser degree in more modern films like The Little Mermaid. He has a mind of his own and figures prominently in the plot.The evil sorceress in the film is fantastic as well. Basically, I adore this movie! Go out and buy it today!!"
60,Sleeping Beauty,,12 August 1999,The Most Beautiful Disney Film Ever to See and Hear,"I saw this film as a small child and loved it in 1959. I did not see it again until 1979 - when I was able to appreciate it more on the Big Screen. I was thrilled. The score, from Tchaikovsky mostly, was magnificently adapted and a joy to hear, The animation was superb and often looked like a medieval painting in the backgrounds. Malefecent (and her crow) may have been the best villain ever in Disney animation - the kind who's so good we don't want her to die. The three fairies were charming, even if a bit derivative of the Seven Dwarfs. Aurora, the princess, was lovely; however, a problem was the prince who was devoid of personality, and there should have been some sparks between him and Aurora. Walt Disney was supposedly too busy with Disneyland to pay close enough attention to the production, but I don't buy that. Another minor problem is that the final battle scenes - especially on the Big Screen - are enough to scare adults; I doubt if little kids would enjoy it, although I did. I know they wouldn't appreciate the scoring or animation fine points. Sleeping Beauty has its devotees and even a web site, and no wonder. Too bad it's not as well appreciated as some. Despite a few small problems this is a charming, gorgeous movie and my favorite of all Disney's animations."
61,Sleeping Beauty,7,7 June 2014,Not a classic but not bad,"Disney version of the fairy tale. Princess Aurora is born and cursed (for no real reason) by evil Maleficent to die on her 16th birthday. Three fairies--Flora, Fauna and Merryweather--lessen the curse to just make her sleep, not die. Aurora grows up protected by the three fairies and then meets tall, handsome Prince Phillip--on her 16th birthday. They immediately fall in love but the curse comes to pass. Aurora falls into a deep sleep and only the kiss of the prince can awaken her. Phillip is set on awakening Aurora but he'll have to fight Maleficent to get her.This took six YEARS and millions of dollars to make. It was also the first animated movie to be released in widescreen (called Technirama 70). However it was not a hit critically or commercially...and it's easy to see why. The story is vague with plot holes and continuity lapses galore. The palace scenes are incredibly annoying. The main characters move fluidly but all the background characters don't move an inch. They look like what they are--drawings. The characters are either annoying (the fairies), bland (Aurora and especially Phillip) or just evil for no reason (Maleficent). On the plus side most of the animation is great and takes full advantage of the wide screen (do NOT see this in a pan and scan version). A highlight is the final battle between Phillip and Maleficent. The songs are tuneful (if forgettable) and the score is just fantastic. Also Maleficent is a great Disney villainess.So it is a very good Disney film but no classic."
62,Sleeping Beauty,6,23 June 2010,"... not really the classic I was expecting, even in full widescreen","For fans of Sleeping Beauty, the latest DVD release from Disney- one of their ""Platinum"" editions with 2 discs and games and so on- is worth full price. It gives the fans a chance to see the film as it was originally intended for theaters, in a 2:20:1 aspect ratio (even slimmer than 2:35, think the aspect ratio of Ben-Hur for comparison), and all of the cinematic detail, of the backgrounds and the characters in the foreground, is all there with digitally restored picture and sound. If nothing else, even as I didn't care for the film itself very much, it is worth sort of rejoicing. Sort of.I didn't like the movie (!) Yes, not by a lot. Compared to the other Disney films of the period, even with the other Princess films (Snow White and Cinderella, even if they aren't princesses all the way through), this one falls short. The main characters are bland, even by Disney standards which for protagonists, ESPECIALLY the male prince characters, are without personality. Watching these characters do little on screen but prance in the woods and immediately fall in love just made me think fondly of other Disney films, including the ""new"" crop from the past twenty years like The Little Mermaid and Aladdin, which have similar fantastic stories and one-dimensional leads only given more personality and depth and flaws.It's like Disney and his team took a lot of the elements from past films and cobbled them together. It's not that the film is even all bad, far from it. Any time Maleficent or her troll-like minions come on screen, or when the movie by proxy of her evil magic gets dark, suddenly the movie comes alive. Particularly so this happens when Princess Aurora, left alone in the room by her three good-hearted but dim-witted magic women, goes up the staircase following a green light in a trance (Vertigo, anyone?) And of course things are often beautifully animated, such as those backgrounds and the matte paintings. Other times- and I know I may get crap for this- it looks oddly cheap, dated.There is magic stuff here, and classic moments, and a scene with the two kings as they get drunk that's actually quite funny and lively and feels entertaining. But the rest of the film is a sort of plastic farce, where characters do stupid (or just Disney-generic) things and it takes so long to get to better parts that aren't clouded by ill-logic (i.e. the making-everyone-in-the-kingdom-asleep trick that seems kind of, I dunno, wrong on some level seeing it all grown up). Perhaps for kids it works much better, or for those who are only looking for some of the 'classic' Disney animation in full widescreen. But so much of it is lacking in ways that just elude me, and make me want to go back to the other Disney classics for better results."
63,Sleeping Beauty,7,3 September 2001,Some truly beautiful moments,"Widescreen Disney animated fairy tale with music classily adapted from Tchaikovsky has three good fairies sheltering a princess, who has been doomed by a curse. Free of the usual Disney manipulations, but also a little short on humor. One of the fairies constantly grumbles in a snit, there's a slapstick wand fight, but that's about it in the fun & games department. The backgrounds are angular and subdued, and that fits well with the more-or-less serious tone, but interest starts to wane with about 15 minutes to go. There are some lovely set pieces: the burning of all the spinning wheels shown in longshot, the entire village falling asleep at once, the raven circling the forest looking for Aurora, seeing lights blazing through the brush. The music is gorgeous and the voice-work impeccable. *** from ****"
64,Sleeping Beauty,2,21 May 2007,"Disney, where's your emotion?","Not having watched Sleeping Beauty as a child, I hunkered down to this film with mediocre expectations at best. Surprisingly, even then it failed to impress me.Having heard such praise of Maleficent as ""she's the greatest villain ever!"" I was disappointed by her easy defeat and emotionless portrayal. I found the three fairies Merryweather, Flora, and Fauna to be dry and uninteresting (they take up a good half of the movie and laughably are supposed to be the comic relief). The friendship between Sleeping Beauty and the animals felt too forced - doesn't Disney have any other way to convey a gentle and friendly persona? The one joke which made me smile was the pink-blue debacle. But for its 75 minute runtime, a few seconds of genuine entertainment was not worth it.The only aspect of this movie which constantly impressed me was the animation, which is fluid and beautiful. Clyde Geronimi did a wonderful job with that. However, other than animation, I find nothing to recommend of this movie. If you're looking to be emotionally attached to the characters, look elsewhere."
65,Sleeping Beauty,,30 September 2012,ugh!,"I would never bring a Disney movie down, but I have to for Sleeping Beauty. It's just not that great compared to Cinderella and The Little Mermaid. Here's why...1)Maleficent has the worst plans ever! Like who would poison a baby just because she wasn't invited to a birthday party? It's not evil or harsh, just really stupid. I would understand if the good fairies turned her castle into cupcakes and rainbows or if her minions turn into happy elves who loves Christmas and sings dumb songs about coconuts and cats. I admit that the dragon scene is cool, but in all of reality, she's terrible2)Prince Philip did NOT stab Maleficent. If those good fairies were not by his side, Maleficent in dragon form would have stepped on him like if he was an ant, burn him to a crisp, or eat him like he was tootsie rolls. The fairies put the curse on the sword and killed the dragon.3)Aurora doesn't do anything expect when she dances with the prince 2 times. I find her so boring to watch and she's my least favorite Disney princess. She's also very stupid. Doesn't she know how sharp the tip of the spindle wheel gets? Why did the fairies not teach her about the spindle wheel? This reminds me of a time where some guy told me to take some pot and it's good for your body. If Aurora was in this situation, she would be a pot addict. Let's get back to the subject4)The first scene where the people came for Aurora's Christening scares me. I don't know why, it just does. It's not even Maleficent, it's just the music and the poor animation combined which makes it look freaky.I really don't know what to say about this movie. It's just bad. If Maleficent has good logic and all that, she would be the only thing I like about this movie. Hopefully Angelina Jolie will be better as her in 2014. I doubt that"
66,Sleeping Beauty,3,29 September 2015,A cliché attempt at something magical,"I chose to write a review of the Disney movie ""Sleeping Beauty"", as it is disturbingly different from its origin. It is an adaptation of the fairytale by Charles Perrault, ""The Beauty in the Sleeping Wood"". The Disney version of the fairytale begins with Princess Aurora as a child. Her parents promise that she will marry Prince Phillip of the neighboring kingdom in order to unite the families. They have three fairies come to bless and give gifts to Aurora. The first gift is that of beauty, and the second is that of a beautiful voice. Before the third can be given, Maleficent, the mistress of all evil, arrives and is angry that she was not invited to Aurora's christening. She curses Aurora and says that before the night of her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die. Luckily, the third fairy had not given her gift to Aurora, so the third fairy says that instead of Aurora dying, she will fall into a deep sleep. This is where the Disney adaptation and the original fairy tale go their separate ways. In the Disney version, Aurora is brought by her aunts (the three fairies) to live in safety until her sixteenth birthday. However, she still pricks her finger and is cast into a deep sleep. Prince Phillip fights Maleficent, who turns herself into a dragon, and rescues Aurora by awakening her with a kiss. This is very different from the original version.In the original, Aurora pricks her finger and falls into a deep sleep. One day, the Prince happens by her home and knocks on the door. No one answers, so he climbs in through a window. There he finds Aurora. He tries to wake her, but she is unconscious. So, oddly and disturbingly enough, he proceeds to rape her. Aurora awakens after giving birth to twins. One of her babies tries to find her breast, but finds her finger instead. The baby sucks the splinter from the spinning wheel out of her finger, and Aurora wakes to find that she has two children. This is alarming to me, because she simply accepts her children and does not question their origin or legitimacy. Prince Phillip is married, and murmurs the children's names and Aurora's name in his sleep. The queen is furious, understandably. However, though her anger is understandable, she reacts in a disturbing way. She orders the cook to find and boil the children, so that they can be fed to Prince Phillip. The cook does not comply, and instead cooks two lambs. The queen taunts Phillip after he eats the lamb and tells him that he has eaten his own children. After this, the queen creates a fire in order to burn Aurora alive. Prince Phillip manages to stop this from happening and orders that the queen be put to death. And, oddly enough, Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora fall in love and get married. The difference between the Disney version and the original version are astoundingly different. I've never cared much for the Disney movie, mostly because I found it boring and cliché, even as a child. Though, now knowing the original version of the story, I can see why the movie would come off as boring. Disney clearly had to remove huge portions of the story in order to make it colorful, glossy, and suitable for children. In my honest opinion, I think that Disney should have left this one alone. The movie is superficial and contains no real message. The bulk of the story had to be removed, and, though what was removed was alarming, it leaves behind a well-worn, lifeless attempt at something lighthearted and magical."
67,Sleeping Beauty,10,8 November 2004,Romantic classic,"One of the first books that I read as a child was the Disney version of Sleeping Beauty. From that moment onwards, this story captivated me as no other before. The ideas of love at first sight, pure evil, and the goodness of others were all exemplified in this story, and even as a child, I recognized the wonderment of the story.When I actually saw the movie for the first time, though, I must admit. I was a bit disappointed. I felt the drawing of Aurora was too angular and not realistic enough for me. QUICK SPOILER warning!!! I also thought that Prince Phillip was too much of a wuss in the movie - the fairies had to guide him in every step and produce the next step for him as he battled Maleficent. I missed that part of character in the book. END SPOILER.However, putting all that aside, I was still enchanted by the movie. The use of Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty only augmented the beauty of the movie, and heightened the romantic appeal. It was beautiful watching the two fall in love as they danced and sang together. That scene gives a false sense of security that makes the rest of the movie much more exciting. I loved Maleficent, and I must agree with others who feel that Maleficent is the best villain. Even compared to other Disney villains, Maleficent is clearly the most powerful: she has magical ability, decent henchmen(the raven), is never comical(thus making her cruelty much more noticeable), and embodies pure evil. While this movie may not be the best for all, it will always be one of my favorites due to the combination of so many elements that make the film much more realistic than you would believe for a Disney movie. In all simplicity, it is a story of how you must overcome obstacles in order to acquire true love, and such a story is eternal."
68,Sleeping Beauty,9,16 January 2004,The Quiet Masterpiece,"Sleeping Beauty was the first Disney movie my parents bought for my sisters and I.  That was a long time ago and numerous Disney movies later, I've almost forgotten about Disney's third animated feature.  It was never really my favorite as a kid, maybe because as some reviewers have said, it has a great amount of appeal to adults.  The story is kind of darker with no talking animals, and Maleficent, who is probably the meanest and bitterest of all the Disney villains, makes a reference to hell.  That's something you don't see everyday in a Disney movie.Nevertheless, this movie is still to be appreciated by young and old alike. Walt Disney and his staff never cease to amaze me on their ambitious efforts.  While I think Snow White's animation is more colorful and lively, Sleeping Beauty seems to have a unique animation style all its own.  At first glance, I wasn't too impressed with the forest scenes, but looking again, they almost have a different artistic style, maybe reminiscent of the time period and setting that the movie takes place.  Furthermore, I heard that Disney made this film to accompany a widescreen-type format.  Now how in the world did he see that coming?!Sleeping Beauty doesn't have the most colorful or bounciest story, but it is unique compared to other Disney flicks.  As I wrote earlier, the villain is just absolutely diabolical, and the prince in this movie actually sacrifices his life and battles an army of followers and a sinister dragon.  But what makes Sleeping Beauty stand out the most is its magnificent score based on Tchaikovsky's ballad of the same name.  The songs are pretty good too with the hilarious drinking song Skumps (another indication this was aimed at adults) and my favorite, Once Upon a Dream, which reminds me of visiting Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom.All in all, Sleeping Beauty is a fine contribution to the Disney legacy.  It may not stand out as much as Snow White or Bambi, but it definitely should not be forgotten.My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A- (Almost Perfect)"

Australian release through Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer: 24 December 1959. 75 minutes.SYNOPSIS: There is much rejoicing in the kingdom for a daughter is born to King Stefan and his queen. Both Stefan and visiting King Hubert, the ruler of a neighboring country, have long wished to unite their lands by the marriage of their children. On this occasion they announce the betrothal of young Prince Phillip to the infant Princess Aurora. Outside the castle, knights and their ladies, townspeople and peasants, join in a joyous processional. While the nobility are celebrating within the great hall, a shaft of light suddenly appears and floating down it come the tiny figures of three good fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Waving their magic wands they bestow on the baby their favors: Flora, the gift of beauty; Fauna, the gift of song, but before Merryweather can bestow the gift of happiness, Maleficent, the evil witch, appears in a blinding flash of lightning. Angered at not being invited to the festivities she prophesies that before the sun sets on Aurora's sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. NOTES: ""Sleeping Beauty"", Walt Disney's $6,000,000 animated production in Technicolor and Technirama, is dormant in title only. Six years of sustained effort went into it. For Disney, who liked to tackle the impossible and usually achieved it, this cartoon feature was his most challenging. ""Hundreds of our top artists and craftsmen were involved in the picture"" Disney declared at the time. ""It took a million drawings to bring 'Sleeping Beauty' to life on the screen."" The big screen imposed tremendous added labors on the artists. They had to move their characters in larger fields of action. They had to create different color schemes and a new landscape for the classic tale. The mathematical calculations became much more intricate. Every phase of artistry and mechanics which together comprise the art of animation, the art of drawing in motion, had to be revamped. ""In fact, the most difficult barrier for the artists was to keep them from covering old ground used in former cartoon classics  to keep their concepts fresh and talents sharp."" Directing animator Marc Davis handled both Sleeping Beauty herself (otherwise known as both Princess Aurora and Briar Rose) and Maleficent. Helene Stanley was the live model for Beauty, whilst Jane Fowler posed for Maleficent and Ed Kemmer for the Prince.Filmed in Technirama 70mm, ""Sleeping Beauty"" was printed and projected anamorphically at an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Initial worldwide film rentals gross returned only $5.3 million, a long way short of recouping the movie's $6 million negative cost, plus print, advertising and distribution overheads.COMMENT: This Disney DVD rates 10/10. The wide anamorphic screen is always full of movement. Absolutely chock-a-block. Never has the wide-wide screen been used so effectively  in either an animated or a live action film. Disney artistry at its super best, ""Sleeping Beauty"" is an entertainment masterpiece."
71,Sleeping Beauty,10,29 June 2017,Wonderful Disney classic,"This is a beautiful movie! From backgrounds to songs, this is a masterpiece. The backgrounds look real, Aurora is a beautiful singer, there is romance, there is adventure, Maleficent is one of the most dangerous and exciting Disney villains.... This is an excellent movie.Of course, it isn't perfect. There are some parts that are a bit dull and where I'm itching for the movie to become a bit faster, such as when Aurora is walking up stairs to touch the spindle or when the fairies put everyone to sleep; and meeting someone ""once upon a dream"" is a bit weird, but the song makes up for it, and those are not enough to make me keep from watching it! There are moments that give me sheer joy. I love the little-known song ""I Wonder"" that Aurora sings, and the movie is a beautiful and delicate story that is entertaining and worth watching."
72,Sleeping Beauty,,8 May 2017,Maleficent = HOT BAD GIRL,"Other reviewers have touched upon the use of music as an emotional catalyst and the surreal artistry and animation of this film, and I wholeheartedly agree that Disney takes the art to an entirely new level in this film. But there's another, more subtle element not mentioned in other reviews... When you compare the sweet, simplicity of Aurora with the sexy sophistication of Maleficent, it's quite obvious that the animators were telling us, with a wink and a nod, that bad girls might be sexy and alluring, but that in the end, we should settle down with a nice girl. The fact that they create such an incredibly hot villainess however, ensures we understand the subtext: Bad girls are hot and beautiful, dangerous girls are the standard against which lesser women will always be measured. I saw this as a child and have been a fan of naughty women ever since. Excellent film!"
73,Sleeping Beauty,7,30 April 2016,?,"As my aunt's personal favorite Disney movie, I have absolutely no idea what to say about Sleeping Beauty other than the fact that I merely enjoyed it. The magic is stellar as always, and the action is satisfactory, but I didn't feel the ""THIS IS THE BEST Disney MOVIE EVER!"" vibe that I felt with Mary Poppins after seeing both of them. It might be a result of fantasy (as I mentioned, magic plays a major role, like the argument over a dress color) and action (Maleficent vs. Philip) that, in the style that it was executed, wasn't a particular trigger of my animation taste buds. The animation is just what we'd expect from Disney, but one case in particular caught my eye: Aurora. Specifically, Aurora was animated predominantly by Iwao Takamoto, who you Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. fans might recognize as the creator of Scooby-Doo. The style that Aurora was drawn in gave me flashbacks to when I loved The Scooby-Doo Show, and so even though that came 10 to 18 years after Sleeping Beauty, I enjoyed the film slightly more when I made that connection. If you're unfamiliar with Scooby-Doo and its style, then you might want to consider seeing that before viewing Sleeping Beauty. Not my personal favorite, but nevertheless worth a view."
74,Sleeping Beauty,,9 January 2016,An artistic and magical Disney classic,"This movie goes out of its way to look different and distinguish itself from other previous Disney films of the same genre with powerful and colorful picturesque settings, while adhering to an established successful plot line.Sleeping Beauty gives me the pinnacle of what a Disney movie should be, it is not dragging, or too fast paced. There is no prolonged back story, while at the same time not jumping plot lines. Songs also don't interfere with the plot, instead bolstering the story. There are no random ""lets just stop everything and get the entire village to star singing and dancing"" scenes, which I always felt took me out of the movie.Furthermore, this movie is not really about Sleeping beauty (Aurora) herself, or Prince Phillip- the supposed main characters. Instead we follow the 3 fairies battle Maleficent- perhaps one of the greatest villains in Disney. Seriously- she is pure evil. Anyway, this battle of good vs evil is classic Disney, with their themes of ""true love""trying to prevail evil.My only downside is not having the characters be developed more, but otherwise, my all time favorite Disney film!10/10"
75,Sleeping Beauty,7,15 February 2015,Transition in Styles,"Sleeping Beauty is a transitional film between the delicate, soft look from the 30s, 40s, and 50s and the sketchy, stylized films that were prominent in the 60s and 70s. The film has a stylized look, yet the characters yet the characters still have the soft lines. Sleeping Beauty is also a mess in some ways. The story is disjointed and unfocused at times. It's basically a rehash of Cinderella and Snow White. In fact some unused concepts from Snow White were used in this film. There are some great characters here though. The 3 fairies are fun and amusing. Bill Thomson does a great voice performance as King Hubert. Aurora is probably one of the most beautiful of the Disney heroines, yet despite being the title character, she doesn't have much screen time, even before she's put to sleep. The fairies that take care of her have the most screen time. Malifacent is one of the most interesting Disney villains. Eleanor Audley, who previously voiced Lady Tremaine in Cinderella, does a great performance. Another problem with the story is that there are too many dues ex machinas (the 3 fairies) which severely rob the story of its build up and climax. This can be summed up by the fact that when this was in production, Walt was busy working on Disneyland. Production went on for so long that it came to a point where Walt said, just finish the picture. This would also be the last fairy tale that the studio would do until The Little Mermaid thirty years later."
76,Sleeping Beauty,,17 January 2006,"You all know the story: invite the evil fairy to the party, or she's going to get seriously ticked off.","This is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. I like the princess, I like the villain, and Phillip is at least my second favorite Disney prince. Aurora is nobody's fool and her voice is too low to shatter glass, Phillip actually has a personality, and it's a funny, charismatic one, and Maleficent is a masterpiece. She's so elegant and vindictive, and I feel bad for her because her minions are pretty worthless. The only thing I don't like about this movie is that Maleficent's presence makes it kind of uneven. She's so cool, and the good fairies are just kind of silly. The songs aren't as good as later Disney flicks, mostly because they only really had one song, and they knew it."
77,Sleeping Beauty,9,19 June 2005,THE FILES OF: Sleeping Beauty!,"Sleeping Beauty definitely is a dark movie, but still has a cheery and airy feel to it. I remember when I was younger my parents didn't want me watching it because I might be scared.This wasn't my favorite Disney classic, but I do like it.I've chosen to base the fractured fairytale I'm writing on this movie.It's called THE FILES OF: Sleeping Beauty, email me if you want to read it! ^_^My personal favorite scene of Sleeping is the one where the three fairies are making the the dress, cleaning, and making the cake.I also like the scene at the end where the fairies keep changing the dress colors from pink to blue, go pink!!! XDI don't remember this movie very well, because I haven't watched it in some years, but I'd like to.(Love my spaces!)"
78,Sleeping Beauty,,25 December 2002,what i think of sleeping beauty! :),sleeping beauty is the best movie ever! it has an awesome soundtrack. so much detail is in every scene. everything about this movie is great. my favorite part is when flora fauna and merryweather are baking the cake and making the dress for aurora (briar rose) for her 16 birthday. its so funny and cute!
79,Sleeping Beauty,,18 November 2002,Help! Is there some missing footage at the start??!,"I watched this film as a child in England during the mid 70's in a Theater and upon seeing it again recently I can't help but wonder if there isn't a slightly longer / theatrical version that existed. I seem to recall that there was a part in the beginning where you see the kings invitations for the birth of the Princess get delivered to the fairies house and one of the 4 invitations to the fairies falls under the rug as they fall into the mail slot by the front door. As a result of this mistake, the formerly good Maleficent becomes bitter and vengeful over what she thinks was a deliberate snub by the King. This is really bugging me as I've looked all over IMBD for a clue! Does anyone remember this who might of seen this film years ago in a theater and not the more recently released versions available on DVD and VHS and laserdisc? Please let me know! Thanks!"
80,Sleeping Beauty,,11 November 2002,This movie is the absolute best in animation,"I love this movie, I have a collection of all the Sleeping Beauty merchandise that I can get my hands. This movie is the pinnacle of animation. The color, detail and design are exquisite. This movie is the most wonderful romantic and lovely movie that I have ever seen."
81,Sleeping Beauty,,9 October 2002,Great! Great!,"Sleeping Beauty is one of the all-time animation greats! There's no denying it. But some people dare to think of it as badly animated!The movie is beautifully animated! It's supposed to look like a medieval Gothic painting (which it does) and most of Disney's subsequent movies up till ""The Little Mermaid"" failed to look even half as good! The animation is fluent, the expressions real, each character is realistic.Knock the story (a great one if not a bit too sweet), knock the voice-acting (you would be liar if you did!), knock the occasionally annoying soundtrack, but the animation is perfect!ONE MAJOR PROBLEM:Sleeping Beauty was in production for six years. Why? Because they spend days on the medieval back-grounds because the were filming it in 70mm! 70mm film! If it is filmed in that ratio, then why are most DVDs issued in full-screen with no option for full-screen?Oh, how it pains the mind!But other than that; enjoy!"
82,Sleeping Beauty,8,31 May 2002,In a class by itself.,"Sleeping Beauty is a golden Disney movie. It's so picturesque and brilliant. Whenever I put this on it gives me a deep sense of peace and comfort. There's something magical in the animation of the woods, creatures and castles. Just like reading a Brothers Grimm tale, it transports the viewer to a dreamy place in the past. You can't help but fall in love with the three faeries: Flora, Fauna and Merriwether. They guide the ravishing Briar Rose (AKA Princess Aurora) to brace her fate and to meet Prince Phillip, the Prince Charming of every girl's dream. The evil is dark and foreboding, and the good is light and beautiful. I think it's very much like Sword in the Stone (another excellent one) in the sense that the animation is splendid and it takes place in the medievel times...that alone conjures up visions of enchantment. Watch out for a cute line said by Prince Phillip to his father when he tries to persuade him that marrying someone under your rank is OK. ""After all..it's 1435"" or something on that order..ahh it's pretty cute. So simple, such good storytelling...fabulous."
83,Sleeping Beauty,,11 February 2000,One of the best Disney movies ever!,Well I can't say enough about this great film. The story alone is one of our greatest treasures. I think everyone knows the story by now. I just want to tell you why I love this film so much! The characters are fun and so funny. Walt Disney out done himself with this one! It still holds up to today animation.Just see this great animated film. You will not be disappointed. Out of 4 stars I give it 4 stars. Enjoyable for the whole family!
84,Sleeping Beauty,8,1 February 2000,One of the best Disney movies made.,"Sleeping Beauty is absolutely one of the best Disney movies ever made, truely standing the test of time even now forty years after it's creation. The art work is lush and vibrant even by today's standards. Princess Aurora is one of the most beautiful of Disney's heroines, making it quite easy to see why the Prince would fall in love with her at first sight. But the real star of the movie is Maleficent. As a child, she was the only Disney baddie to ever truely scare me. She commits all these acts of pure evil and terror merely because she wants too. Not only is her curse terrifying but to actually think of the sixteen years of torture that the king and queen went through can make one realize just how manical Maleficent is. She is the best of all the Disney villians, certainly more so than the lackluster villian from Tarzan. This one is the ONE to compare all Disney movies by."
85,Sleeping Beauty,,4 April 2002,Probably the best Disney's movie I've seen forever!,"My personal opinion was, of course, that this classic fairy tale has been a best-seller for over much many years ago and perhaps the most Disney's wonderful success. But I'd want to do an adaptation on this movie and for that reason I'd proceed to all the necessary legal procedures to make it legally in both the Greek and Cypriot markets. Anyway, one of the almost Disney's sneakiest scoundrels that appeared on most of Walt's movies was the evil spurned witch Maleficent with his quite often malicious raven, Diablo. As you've noted, in the Greek version of the movie, Maleficent was voiced by Greek theater and TV actress Anna Makraki, which take his voice by Eleanor Audley, who died at Northern Hollywood, California (USA), in August 25th, 1991, due to an respiratory failure.Oh, and I'll have noted my Maleficent's favorite quotes: ""Listen well, all of you! The princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty, beloved by all who know her. But, before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die!"",""It's incredible, sixteen years and not a trace of her! She couldn't have vanished into thin air. Are you sure you searched everywhere?"",""Fools! Idiots! Imbeciles!..... Oh, they're hopeless. A disgrace to the forces of evil. My pet, you are my last hope. Circle far and wide, search for a maid of sixteen with hair of sunshine gold and lips red as the rose. Go! And do not fail me."",""Touch the spindle. Touch it I say! You poor simple fools... Thinking you could defeat me, me, the mistress of all evil. Well, here's your precious princess!!!"",""Well, this is a pleasant surprise. I set my trap for a peasant, and lo! I catch a prince! Away with him. But gently, my pets, gently, I have plans for our royal guest..."",""What a pity prince Phillip can't be here to enjoy the celebration. Come, we must go to the dungeon and cheer him up."",""Oh come now, prince Phillip. Why so melancholy? A wondrous future lies before you. You, the destined hero of a charming fairy tale come true. Behold, King Stefan's castle, and in yonder topmost tower, dreaming of her true love, the princess Aurora. But see the gracious whim of fate. Why, 'tis the self same peasant maid, who won the heart of our noble prince but yesterday. She is indeed most wondrous fair. Gold of sunshine in her hair, lips that shame the red, red rose. In ageless sleep she finds repose. The years roll by, but a hundred years to a steadfast heart are 'bout a day. And now, the gates of the dungeon part, and the prince is free to go his way. Off he rides on his noble steed ... a valiant figure, straight and tall, to wake his love with love's first kiss, and prove that true love conquers all... Come, my pet. Let us leave our noble prince with these happy thoughts. A most gratifying day. For the first time in sixteen years I shall sleep well."",""Silence! You, tell those fools to ... !!!??? No! No!"",""A forest of thorn shall be his tomb! Born through the skies on a fog of doom! Now go with the curse and serve me well, Round Stefan's castle cast by spell!"",""No, it cannot be!.... Now shall you deal with me, old prince, and all the powers of HELL!!!!"". In this last quote, the witch was transformed into an evil fire-breathing dragon that provoked the fury of Flora, which chanted to Phillip's magic sword: ""Now sword of truth fly swift and sure, That evil die and good endure!"". It was already known to all that Phillip throwed the sword at the dragon, which is hit deadly and collapsed, screaming!!!"
86,Sleeping Beauty,9,29 December 2001,"From Pink-loving little girl to Blue-loving older girl, it's still good","As a kid I was crazy over this movie.  Years later, when I've gotten all cynical about Disney, it's the only one I still think very fondly of. What I think I liked was it improved the original story without ruining it(**cough**cough**Pocohantas**cough**), plus it introduced three fairies who could make it into the top ten for best fairies of all time.(""I love happy endings!"" ""Yes, I do to-*gasp*BLUE!"")  Maybe the songs aren't the best but the score is, and so is Aurora's voice.  This one is one to last."
87,Sleeping Beauty,,31 August 2001,Abolutely Fabulous,"Sleeping Beauty is one of Walt Disney's greatest films made. The background scenery, although said by critics to be domineering is wrong. The background is beautiful and creates the elegant surroundings for a heartwarming classic. The music is beautifully adapted by George Bruns from Tchaikovsky's elegant ballet, and songs are sung wonderfully by Mary Costa. Maleficent is one of Disney's best villains and is voice by the brilliant Eleanor Audley, who was also the voice of Lady Tremaine (Evil Stepmother) in Cinderella. Sleeping Beauty is an incredible movie that will delight everyone."
88,Sleeping Beauty,,18 July 2001,Lovely,"a few **SPOILERS**Ever since I was little I loved this movie.I love thecolour use in the forest scenes with princess Aurora and the woodlandanimals.The music is from the ballet ""Sleeping Beauty"" and is perfectlyarranged to suit the mood and atmosphere.My favourite song is ""Once upona Dream"" which Aurora sings about how she met her dream prince who soonjoins in later on.My favourite character is Malificent,the wonderfullyvoiced and animated villainess.I love her menacing laugh and the sceneswhere she fights prince Philip as a fire-breathing dragon.Anotherfavourite part of the movie for me was when the good fairies wherestruggling to make a cake and dress for Aurora's sixteenth birthdaywithout the use"
89,Sleeping Beauty,10,28 May 2000,My favourite Disney movie.,"This is my favourite of all the Disney movies.  It's the funniest (thanks to the three good fairies) and Maleficent is easily the greatest and most evil Disney villain to date.  No other villain comes close.  The music is great and the feeling is wonderful.  It is often underrated but shouldn't be. It deserves to be considered one of the greatest Disney films, if not the best.See it now if you have not.  You will not be disappointed."
90,Sleeping Beauty,4,15 March 2006,Not that good,"I have mixed feelings about this movie.For one thing, I know we wouldn't have a Sleeping Beauty castle in Disneyland, which I've been too a lot lately, since it's the 50th Anniversary celebration, and I know that the Firework's display is excellent, with the special effects on the castle.The music is 100% stupid. It sounds like it was recorded in a garbage truck. No offense to Mary Costa, but it went completely overboard with the ""I Know You,"" bit. My 13-year old sister used to sing that song all the time, and it was dreadfully annoying. Luckily, she doesn't sing it much anymore.Even without the songs, it would be bad. I just don't think it was 100% well-done.A few voices could have been changed, the songs could have been cut, amidst a hundred other things.My score: 4/10."
91,Sleeping Beauty,6,23 January 2004,Overrated,"One of the last animated features personally supervised by Walt Disney, `Sleeping Beauty' comes across as curiously flat and uninvolving to modern audiences.  The Disney animators dip their toes into a new style, approaching a medieval-folk-art backdrop with their conventional cartoon sensibilities.  An exciting prospect, but sadly the result is too much of a compromise--Disney seems afraid to give us something really new this time (as he had with `Fantasia' years before), and the resulting visual world he creates feels empty and lifeless instead of stark and stylish.  The use of Tchaikovsky's ballet score is another failed stab at high art, with the warbly, wobbly `Once Upon a Dream' turning a great Romantic work into poor-man's MacDonald and Eddy.  It doesn't help that the lead characters are among the dullest in the Disney pantheon; even Maleficent is little more than a cipher in a killer costume.  The final dragon-and-thorns battle sequence almost redeems everything--finally, it gives us something to look at!--but overall the film hasn't aged well, and its good reputation seems be based more on sheer nostalgia than anything else.  6 out of 10."
92,Sleeping Beauty,10,28 January 2005,A true work of art.,"This is my absolute favorite Disney animated feature length film.This Disney classic animation feature concerns a cursed princess, a handsome prince, three good faeries who use Nature Magicks, and one of the best Disney villains of all time; evil personified is Maleficent. I must say that the 2-disk Special Edition is well worth the price if you can locate it. This went out of production and was pulled from shelves in January of 2004, so it may occupy a bit of your time to find it for sale. Upon viewing this as a child, I remember loving the story, but hating that the colors were all faded. It was as if the film it was on had grown thin. I was delighted to find a fully digitally remastered, Dolby digital 5.1 Surround Sound, THX edition with loads and loads of extras and the colors have all been restored!Maleficent having cursed the baby Aurora, our three heroines must find a way to reverse the curse. This movie has a little bit of everything including a fantastic dragon.This is one of the most beautiful Disney treasures within the Disney vaults. I highly recommend its viewing. It's one of the best full length Disney animated features.In its restored state, this movie receives a rousing 10/10 from...the Fiend :."
93,Sleeping Beauty,7,31 May 2004,A nice Disney animated feature,"Princess Aurora is protected by three fairies because an evil witch has cast a curse on the young princess. Before she will turn sixteen she will fall asleep because she touches a spinning-wheel. The fairies try to make sure she will not get near one of those things. If she will fall asleep the only thing that can save her is a prince who kisses her.'Sleeping Beauty' is not as good or charming as the early Disney classics like 'Snow White', 'Dumbo' or 'Pinocchio' but it has some wonderful moments. The story is one of those stories we all know and Disney gives its own nice touch to it. With music adapted from Tchaikovsky's 'Sleeping Beauty Ballet' and some nice animation it is worth seeing, and for Disney fans may be more."
94,Sleeping Beauty,8,14 December 2016,Not a Top 5 but Does a Pretty Good Job,"Disney did so many great things that, for me, some don't quite catch me. Maybe it's the story. Maybe it's the music. Maybe it's a simple lack of the edginess that many of the great one's films often have, but there is something that isn't quite as sharp in this one. Also, I feel the animation isn't as crisp as many of the other films. The story, of course, is that a poor young woman is doomed to sleep for many years after a witch has been crossed. It's an example of how you can do everything you can, but fate steps in and messes with you. But it's a fairy tale that we all know, and things will eventually be dealt with. I feel very positively about this movie; it's just not my favorite. Hooray for Tchaikovsky."
95,Sleeping Beauty,,28 August 2016,Braier Rose,"Sleeping beauty is a wonderful fairytale about a girl who is cursed at birth to prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die on her sixteenth birthday until It can be broken by true live's first kiss. Three fairies take her into their cottage deep within the woods to protect her from Maleficent's evil plan. The historical details never forgotten even with magic and mystical elements making it feel like a true story once upon a time.It's perfectly made from the beautiful animation, the villain is top notch and the songs are masterfully composed. The characters all have unique personalities that it's hard to choose a favorite from Maleficent the deliciously evil sorcerer to the three fairies and their playful antics and gallant prince Philip full of strength and might. The song I dreamt of you once upon a dream complements and bookends it like poetry.What makes it truly exceptional is the loving care put into every detail from with the waving of the leaves to the waving of feathers and wrinkling of noses grounding it in realism. The only leap of faith in logic found is how are clothes created or stitched unless the Fairies lead a helping hand.Walt Disney created an enchanting story that draws you in from the beginning and sweeps you away into its magnificent world.10/10"
96,Sleeping Beauty,9,29 June 2016,Timeless and magnificent,"This film is the adaptation to animation film of the folk tale ""Sleeping Beauty"" by Charles Perrault. Directed by Clyde Geronimi, has a script by Erdman Penner and the voices of Mary Costa, Bill Shirley, Eleanor Audley and other voice actors.The story needs no introduction, as well as any comment to the script, which is basically a reproduction of the tale. Its one of the stories that accompanied the childhood of everyone, and that everyone learned and love. And there was no better way to immortalize it than let Disney do this film, with all the magic usually employed in his works. The dubbing work was very well done and the voices are excellent, the drawings were exquisitely made, the traditional way, as was done before the beginning of digital technologies. The soundtrack, from George Burns, earned the nomination for the Oscar and is excellent in every way, helping to make this film one of the most striking and romantic of Disney's career, and one of the most classic among the several classics that this film studio gave to the world cinema.Timeless, immortal like the story it portrays, this film will continue to be seen and admired for generations, regardless of age, culture or language."
97,Sleeping Beauty,10,29 January 2016,Disney's crowning achievement,"There are some classic movies that you get to know so well, that eventually you think you can just put it on as background noise while you do other stuff, but if you happen to look up at the screen for one moment, you are completely captivated and kept from looking away until the credits have rolled. Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty is one of those movies. This animated production is that rare, perfect alignment of masters of their crafts, like Marc Davis, directing animator of both the film's protagonist and antagonist, and painter Eyvind Earle who served here as production designer, among many other artists, that creates something wonderfully unlike anything else. When it was decided to do Sleeping Beauty, the company knew they would have to push the artistry further than they ever had before to purposefully make the film stand out from everything that had ever come before it. The story's medieval setting perfectly caters to this with Gothic architecture, patterned tapestries, sculpted box trees and other hyper detailed background elements. To match, Disney ditched the soft and round and inviting characters that they usually portray for character designs that are more jagged and angular, strong with deep straight and vertical lines. The detail of the film really is just staggering. Add to that the fact that this was all done in Super Technirama 70 means not only more detailed art, but physically larger portions of art needed to be created to fill the film's frame, and every single frame from this film could be a framed painting hanging in a museum all on its own.Just as your eyes finally settle from all the detail and you think the movie couldn't be any more perfect, it happens. A blustery wind and a flash of lightening introduces you to the most iconic villain in all of the Disney stable. If anyone can crash a party and completely steal a show, it is Maleficent, which is a feat from a character with very little action. She's a speech giver, which means her captivation comes completely from her design, her slight movements, her voice, and her overall demanding presence. She can stand completely still and yet you will never lose her within the intricacies of the settings around her because you will never even take your eyes off of her. A spell has truly been cast, and while our princess has the least amount of lines for any human title character in a Disney animated movie, Maleficent more than fills the stage, making the movie really all about her.Other characters, like the film's hero Prince Phillip, are also more well rounded than the archetype had been in previous Disney films, and he would have to be to even enter into such a dark and threatening climatic battle. This Dark Ages atmosphere of Sleeping Beauty is spurned on by its classical score, a brilliant arrangement by George Bruns of the original music from the Sleeping Beauty ballet composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The idea to take this well known music and reset it to the events of the movie adds weight and seriousness, as well as an heir of familiarity. It also does well to heighten certain moments in the film to truly chilling and mesmerizing states.It's a wonder that the film was a failure upon its initial release. The increase to its art and production meant that it was also Disney's most expensive animated film to date, and unfortunately could not make its money back at the box office, resulting in quite a change in style at the studio. The company's next release would be the scratchily designed 101 Dalmatians, with Sleeping Beauty ending the era of the lush and overly romantic Disney animated film. It has since gained both its money back and popularity, though, considered by many to be one of Disney's crowning achievements. As for me, I am perfectly comfortable in going further than that to call Sleeping Beauty the best animated film of all time."
98,Sleeping Beauty,9,10 January 2016,A Disney masterpiece,"Walt Disney wanted Sleeping Beauty to look completely different to the rest of Disney's animated features and be the pinnacle of animation at the time. In a number areas that was certainly achieved. Though not a success on its release, Sleeping Beauty is a visual wonder and has some of the best elements ever put in a Disney film. The film based itself around both the Charles Perrault and Brothers Grimm versions, as well as using points from the Tchaikovsky ballet. It revolves around a princess cursed to fall into a sleep on her 16th birthday by pricking her finger on a spinning wheel, from which she can only be awaken by her true love. It's a story that is widely known, but what makes the film so effective are the methods used to tell it.There's only one major issue with the film and sadly it's with the main characters. Both Aurora and Prince Phillip are incredibly dull. Aurora does practically nothing of note, all she does is stand around looking pretty or sing with the animals and she just comes off as plain boring. In her defence she is asleep for the second half of the film, but it's difficult to care for her as we know nothing about her because we never get an insight into her character. Prince Phillip is equally as uninteresting. He gets a few funny moments at first, but his attraction to Aurora is rushed and he doesn't really have a personality. He is the focal point of the climax, but he doesn't say a word during it which is odd and gets rather tedious.Elsewhere however the characters are fantastic. The three fairies are wonderful and are effectively the true heroes of the film. They all have distinct personalities without being clichéd, they provide a good balance of appropriate comedy as well drama and the voice actresses (including regulars Verna Felton and Barbara Luddy) do excellent jobs. The two kings who flip-flop between bickering and friendliness get a few good laughs too. With that said, what really pushes the film to great heights is Maleficent who is easily one of Disney's greatest ever villains. It is frighteningly evil the sheer lengths she'll go to over being snubbed at a party, showing that she is simply a superb mix of terrifying and cunning. Her design is a perfect blend of scary and stylish, while Eleanor Audley's classy voice adding even more punch to the character.The animation is simply stunning, completely different to anything Disney had done before or done since. It reminds me a lot of tapestry work or medieval art. It isn't as bright as previous films and everything is drawn in a more realistic style that gives the film an added uniqueness. The overly angular design and muted colour scheme work brilliantly in this respect too. The backgrounds are very flat and allow for the characters to pop out more, but the amount of detail that goes into them is incredible. The forests and castles are just beautiful to look at. The score is equally as good, coming straight from the famed ballet. It allows for some wonderful melodies and some great builds of tension, with songs such as 'Once Upon A Dream' also being very enjoyable.Another impressive aspect is the films atmosphere. There is a great deal of tension present throughout the film and an ever building sense of dread that makes everything at stake seem all the more important. I also enjoy how unsettling the film can be, the whole sequence involving the spinning wheel is extremely creepy thanks to the visuals and the haunting music which are both used expertly. The film also has a lot of slower moments that work in its favour in allowing the atmosphere to build up. There's also a lot more action and intensity than you would expect, in fact the climax is one of Disney's best. It keeps on building in obstacles that Prince Philip must face and Maleficent becoming a dragon takes it all to another level.On the whole I'd say Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's strongest works from their golden age. It does have its faults mainly in its two leads who are very dull, but what it does well it does incredibly well. As said this is possibly Disney's best looking film, certainly one of their most unique, and it's a film worth viewing for the visuals alone. I think the fairies are very enjoyable, there is a wonderfully sense of atmosphere throughout and the music is fantastic. Maleficent is one of Disney's greatest villains, whenever she appears you can't take your eyes away and she has everything you would want in a villain. It's a film that rewards repeated viewings and one that is always engaging whenever I watch it."
99,Sleeping Beauty,10,31 August 2015,Timeless Disney Treasure,"Sleeping Beauty is a good now as it was then, its another Disney timeless classic you can watch over and over without getting bored.That big dragon wow it still scares me to this day! I think modern cartoons and animation loose something in the hand drawn quality I feel like with modern children's films, there almost churning them out like a factory. Mass produced. After watching this film when your a kid you spend the rest of your time trying to recreate that perfect moment. For me through fantasy and science fiction. The quality of the reproduction is just as good as it was originally on the big screen. I can't rate this movie highly enough - 10 out of 10 just doesn't seem to do it justice somehow."
100,Sleeping Beauty,10,12 July 2014,A childhood favourite. I ADORE it.,"Possibly the definition of style-over-substance, I can barely explain why I love this film above all other Disney films... It almost ditches everything narrative to provide one of the greatest villains of all time. For me the film is hardwired: I love it.The story is as simple as they come. When Princess Aurora is born, she is blessed by the three good fairies with life-long gifts of beauty and song, but another fairy, the wicked Maleficent, curses the child to be killed before her sixteenth birthday. Only one true love can possibly save Aurora should the curse be fulfilled.Even though my feelings for this film are deep, deep down in my heart and cannot be explained (when I started Cinema Cocoa, on my Top 50 films, this came 16th) I will admit there are issues with it. It is terribly simplistic. Our characters have next to no motivation or any character outside of classic archetypes. Aurora could be any number of Disney princesses; she starts out life hidden away from Maleficent's knowledge by the ditsy three fairies Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, and while nowadays she might have become ditsy herself (ie Tangled) Aurora becomes... completely unassuming and quite bland. She walks in the forest, singing about her one true love, talks with animals, sings some more. But you can see she is at least curious, if a little ignorant. Our Prince, Prince Phillip, is even more generic and not very memorable (his noble horse is of course a classic Disney character). No... all of Sleeping Beauty's power (and terror) radiates from the merciless Maleficent, and while she too has virtually no characterisation either outside of being the antagonist (she wasn't invited to the Royal party?? That would make anyone mad!) the film gives her so much gravitas and absolute menace. She hardly shows herself, but her scenes are easily, easily the most memorable moments and will sear themselves into any young child's mind forever. From her curse, to the mesmerising and haunting Spinning Wheel scene, to of course... the finale. The finale to end all finales, so short but so intense. I could happily go on and on about her.So do I purely enjoy this film for its antagonist? Probably; Maleficent is at the centre of my love for villains, but Sleeping Beauty's soundtrack is wonderful, haunting and very memorable. I've not watched it in years but the visuals are very striking too. Even on the old posters it says: ""Wondrous to see, glorious to hear"".A lot of it is aimed at girls, I admit. Most of the film is following the three fairies taking care of Aurora in their hideaway (failing to bake cakes and make dresses) and with only their mistakes to drive the plot forward. Aurora's constant singing about her elusive dream of her Prince Charming. A couple of kings who rather needlessly fill time with comedic singing and drinking (reminds me of another favourite: The Sword in the Stone) there's plenty to find irksome for the modern viewer.I guess I am just smitten with it. I still get chills towards the end. A film normally requires good characters to envelope me into caring and fearing for their lives by the end... but Sleeping Beauty doesn't do that (at least not for me); it instead sells one of film's greatest villains and the terrible wrath she happily bestows upon the hapless.I love it."
101,Sleeping Beauty,10,25 June 2014,"Magic, Music & Maleficent","This is a good ""damsel in distress"" story filled with magic, music and Maleficent! I fell in love with this movie when I was a girl! The strangest part is I really liked the jealous Queen Maleficent just as much as Princess Aurora and ""Prince Charming"".The best scenes to me were the fairy's battle of the dress and the battle between Maleficent and the Prince. Both were extremely memorable and funny. I still have an unused postcard I acquired at Epcot that has the battle scene of Maleficent as the Dragon & the Prince. The songs aren't to bad... ""Once Upon A Dream"" to me is the best and a very beautiful song indeed! It was used in a most romantic moment in the film.All in all the is film great! I do recommend this movie to anyone looking for their ""Prince or Princess"".10/10"
102,Sleeping Beauty,8,23 April 2014,Entertaining Movie With a Small Role for the Princess,"I don't think I ever saw this movie as a kid; that was back in the days when Disney wouldn't put their movies on TV, and I don't think I saw it in the theater. But I've become curious about the old Disney films, so I thought I'd take a look.While the title focuses on sleeping beauty, the movie itself focuses on good and bad magic, the good represented by three fairies, the bad by the wicked Malificent. This is fortunate, because the beauty and her love interest are painfully dull; Disney's attempt to create classically attractive people is rather unattractive.The fairies, on the other hand, are delightful and often quite funny, and Malificent is a wonderful character who I imagine would be rather scary for children. Outside of the two lovers, character design is very good, 50s-era design (things went downhill for Disney in the 60s). Some of the animation is impressive (particular scenes with Malificent). The music is rather unfortunate, featuring cheesy choral arrangements that represent the worst of that era's musical concepts, but overall this is very good. I still prefer the modern Disney of Frozen and Beauty and the Beast, but this is well worth watching."
103,Sleeping Beauty,10,21 February 2014,To all the feminist out there...,"Give this movie another watch without prejudice. Don't watch this movie thinking about how the beautiful princess gets rescued by a beautiful prince and then call it sexist trash. I feel like people aren't giving these princess movies much of a chance. People are afraid of things they don't get. This movie is based on a ballet. And a centuries old fairytale, that is far darker and twisted then this Disney version. A pinch of understanding will make a big difference on how you see this movie. People want the princess to be a wild bohemian woman of the forest instead of a elegant soft mannered girl (like its such a BAD thing). Sleeping beauty probably has more female characters then in most Disney princess movies. Aurora, Flora, Fauna, Merryweather, Maleficent. They each show different forms of femininity. Aurora - the beautiful teen princess, The three elderly good fairies - Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, Maleficent - the glamorous evil witch. The story itself is very simple and straightforward, but look and listen closely or you can miss the subtle details. A lot happens on Auroras first birthday. Everyone in the kingdom rejoices for the blessed birth of their new princess. Hail to the Princess Aurora! Then Flora blesses baby Aurora with the Gift of Beauty, while Fauna gave the child the Gift of Song. Before Merryweather could give the child her gift, Maleficent appeared and invoked a curse that would cause the princess to die upon pricking her finger on the spindle of spinning wheel. Her feelings were hurt that she wasn't invited to Auroras B-day bash. Merryweather though was able to weaken it and provide a means for the curse to be broken. Instead of dying, Aurora would instead fall into a deep sleep from which only True Love's Kiss would awaken her, breaking the spell. Oh and before all that Aurora is betrothed to a 7 year old Prince Phillip. The three good fairies come up with a plan to take Aurora from the palace and raise her as their own, deep and secluded in the forest were Maleficent wont find her. Very simple. Here's a list to shorten things up.Aurora is beautiful inside and out. Shes not just a pretty face, her kindness is shown through her forest animal friends. Shes a symbol of all things good and beautiful. Not just some object. She wasn't the cause of all her misfortunes. And everyone not just the prince sacrifices themselves for her. She is the dearly loved and treasured to everyone in her kingdom. The prince in this movie has a name and his name is Phillip.Phillip is lured towards Aurora by her spellbinding voice, which Fauna gifted her with. A little bit of help before anyone knew of what was to come. Once upon a Dream is a sum up of everything that happened before Aurora meets Phillip and everything after. '' I know you a walked with you once upon a dream, I know you the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam''The three good fairies are female heroes. Instead of swords they wield wands. They brought up Aurora hoping it would save her from Maleficents wrath. They rescue Phillip and help slay her in the end.Aurora isn't overly passive. Her godmothers told her not to speak to strangers, yet she does when Phillip shows up. When she finds out about her true identity being a princess instead of a peasant and how shes betrothed to some prince. She panics. She doesn't want some prince, she wants Phillip. Pretty cool though how they were betrothed to be married, and then they find each other 16 years later and fall in love on their own terms. Aurora isn't going to defy the very people who raised and loved her all her life. So she simply goes with her godmothers to the Castle obediently. If she was truly overly lovesick, she would have just ran off or something. Prince Phillip does the most. He sacrifices his life to save his love. Hes such a man. As Aurora sleeps in the highest tower, her people sleep from the spell the three fairies put on them. Everyone wakes up only when there princess wakes up. How dark and romantic is that. Everyone loves her, and everyone suffers with her. lolThere's a lot of layers here in this movie. More then I can list. People mock the damsel in distress as if these poor girls could do anything about it. Give it another go without prejudice and you may just fall in love with this masterpiece."
104,Sleeping Beauty,10,18 December 2013,The roaring 50s,"It's the roaring 50's and Disney had it's heydays.Movies like Lady & the Tramp and Sleeping Beauty.The beautiful princess Aurora is born.But the evil witch Maleficent is jealous.As the evil witch wants to find Aurora are some fairies hiding her in a cabin in the woods.Later are the young princess falling in love with a prince under a dance in the forest.But Maleficent's creatures finds the princess.So the final climax comes where the witch turns into a dragon.The animation, music and sound is striking.Go watch this movie on a widescreen, and turn up the volume.The movie is cute, but the bad Maleficent also steals the show.Now I'm hyped for Maleficent.10/10"
105,Sleeping Beauty,,18 October 2013,Maleficent,"she is more than a character. and for this fact, the contribution of Eleanor Audley is fundamental.but the evil pole is not only the mark of this animation who remember the rules of Disney universe and, in same measure, remains an inspired exercise to use a fairy tale dates, but great seed for definition of realistic bad character.result - a film impressive and soft, dark and adorable, with four unforgettable witches and a delicate princess who remains only axis of story. the original part - the fight of prince against Maleficent who remembers old Balkan legends. the secret ingredient - the voice of Verna Felton who gives entire nuances of flavor to her character but, off course, to entire film like an hot fluffy muffin."
106,Sleeping Beauty,10,19 October 2011,Best of the Princess series,"Sleeping Beauty didn't catch most of my attention when I was younger, but watching it now I was blown away by all it's Old School Disney glory. I loved all the scenery, probably because I'm a fan of Medieval themes and thought here it was a nice twist by Walt. All the songs and vocal work are as luscious and pure than any Disney flick before or after it in my opinion. From the storybook beginning ""Sweet Aurora"" chime on, it seems as though the harmonizers were vying for your attention over the main characters. Maleficent is by far the best character in the film and probably the greatest Disney villain ever to step onto the screen. Her uncalled-for level of evil and mystique over not being invited to Aurora's celebration is far beyond any level of evil her counterparts could dream of. 10/10 Purely magic."
107,Sleeping Beauty,,29 August 2011,Excellent apart from him and her,"I saw Sleeping Beauty when it came out. I was 7, and Maleficent scared the socks off me - I had nightmares for weeks later.It is a decent retelling of the fairy story, albeit with some stylistic variations from the customary Disney formula, not least of which is the first use of 70mm. Every now and then Disney drops a clunker in terms of the lack of appeal in what appears on screen - not so here.However, where it falls down - and it does so in a big way - is in Aurora, the main character, and Prince Philip. Both are attractively designed but, unfortunately, completely devoid of any character. Every single supporting character is invested with charisma - Maleficent, her crows, the three fairy godmothers, Aurora's parents, even Philip's horse for heaven's sake - but not the two principals.The climactic battle between Philip and Maleficent outside the thorn-hedged castle, however, is a cracker."
108,Sleeping Beauty,9,23 March 2010,Best Disney movie ever?,"It probably is, followed by Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid. Just some weeks ago, I watched this movie for first time in like, 3-4 years? I always loved this movie, but this time I was stunned on how good it really is. Not only did it surprise me how great the movie is, but it made me watch many other Disney movies and realize how great they also are.Probably everything about this movie is excellent, especially Maleficent. She used to frighten me as a little kid (in a positive way) and she still is. The movie is combined with all things I usually want in a Disney movie; romance, adventure, humor and singing. One song from this movie I especially love is ""Once Upon A Dream"", it's my favorite Disney song along with ""A Whole New World"" from Aladdin.The reason I didn't give this 10/10 is that 10 always means perfect, and there really is no perfect movie out there today. Even though this movie is a masterpiece, there's some things I have to criticize. First off, Aurora should been more on-screen in my opinion. More romance scenes between Aurora and Philip wouldn't hurt. Secondly, when the movie is over, you wish it weren't :( One last thing for those who wonder: Yes, there are guys that likes Disney, including this movie. I'm a male myself."
109,Sleeping Beauty,10,7 March 2009,Disney's  Animated Epic Classic: Sleeping Beauty,"Sleeping Beauty (1959): Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen, Barbara Luddy, Eleanor Audley, Mary Costa, Bill Shirley, Taylor Holmes, Bill Thompson, Candy Candido, Bill Amsbery, Pinto Colvig, Dal MacKennon, Marvin Miller, Thurl Ravenscroft...Director...Clyde Geronimi..Screenplay/Writing...Erdaman Penner, Joe Rinaldi, Winston Hibler, Bill Peet, Ted Sears, Ralph Wright, Milt Banta...Based on the Charles Perrault fairy tale and the ballet by Peter Ilych Tchaikovsky with music arranged by George Bruns.The Masterpiece: When released in 1959, Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty heralded a new era in it's company's animated films that would continue into the 1960's. It was a film that cost Disney 6 million dollars and his most cherished creation that took the entire decade of the 1950's to complete. The result was a beloved and world renowned fairy tale come to epic life on the big screen in Technorama, with amazing sound, color and beautiful music and melodies/themes lifted from Tchaikovsky's ballet score. It was for the folks at Disney their masterpiece not unlike epic movies that had been impressing audiences by the late 50's to compete with home television - The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, etc. But the crown is definitely the animation and bold new cinematic look. This brilliant new look was breathtaking for 1959 audiences who had never seen anything like it. It was a kind of animated epic drama or opera. It owed to principal animator Eyvin Earle's stylistic and artsy technique, plus the contributions of great animators like Don Bluth (who would later in the 80's create films like The Land Before Time, etc) and even Chuck Jones who did work for Looney Tunes. Despite following the ""fairy tale book"" genre that Disney had done with ""Snow White"" and ""Cinderella"", the fairy tale presented in the film is not based on the simplistic original. It is an original Disney re-make of the old and distinctly European tale. Rather than seeing it as a fairy tale, one must see it as being fantasy fiction. Its look borrows from 1400's pre-Renaissance/Gothic Medieval paintings, ""Joan of Arc"" times, Christian and Catholic Europe, coat of arms, embroidery, drapes, banners and architecture. The castles are very European and in fact resemble castles depicted in illustrated manuscripts and even King Ludwig's Neuschwanstein castle in Bavaria, Germany, for which Disney modeled the Disneyland castle in California. Everything is bigger than what it was originally in the tale and it ultimately deals with good versus evil and the protection of an innocent princess by the forces of good from an evil prophecy. The epic battle between Prince Phillip and Maleficent as a Dragon suddenly becomes a sword-and-sorcery fantasy complete with a hero and heroine.Plot: King Stefan and his Queen have their long awaited child/heir Princess Aurora and the whole kingdom celebrates by a lavish and ritualistic, almost Catholic Christening. The Three Good Fairies (in primary colors red, green and blue) Flora (Verna Felton), Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen) and the feisty Merriwether (Barbara Luddy) bestow Aurora with blessings and gifts of beauty, grace and song. But the country's outcast fairy, who is in fact an evil sorceress Maleficent, bitter at not being invited and more so for not being ""wanted"" takes revenge by cursing Aurora with an evil prophecy: On her 16th birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. Merriwether's gift: the reverse spell of putting her to sleep until her true love kisses her. The 3 Fairies take no chances and decide to raise the girl as their own ward in a secluded cottage in the deep woods. Aurora grows into a beautiful young maiden with a beautiful singing voice (Mary Costa vocalizes). Before she knows it, she's met Prince Phillip, out for a ride in the woods, and does not know that he was her betrothed all along. Neither of them are aware of their previous roles as future Prince and Princess. Upon Aurora's return to the castle where she was born, Maleficent uses her dark magic to hypnotize the princess and have her prick her finger on a dark spinning wheel made by witchcraft. The 3 Faries put the entire kingdom to sleep. Maleficent kidnaps Prince Phillip, complicating things until the Fairies rescue him. It's now a direct conflict between Maleficent and the Prince, between good and evil, for the fate of Princess Aurora.The films of Walt Disney, beginning with Snow White, including Fantasia, and the films made in the 50's- Peter Pan, Alice In Wonderland, and Lady And The Tramp, seemed to climax with the ""new"" style of Sleeping Beauty. It was the pinnacle of Disney's animated movies at the time and a fitting fireworks finale to a decade of great movies."
110,Sleeping Beauty,9,14 June 2005,My 2nd favorite Disney movie,"Sleeping Beauty remains a Disney classic, even 30 years after I first saw it. Walt's method of storytelling is unmatched, even today. Combine this with the beautiful melody of Tchaikovsky's waltz, re-arranged to make 'Once Upon a Dream', and the sinister character of Maleficent, who in both human and dragon form casts a terrifying presence.It begins when the Princess Aurora is born to King Stefan & his wife. The whole kingdom, along with 3 good fairies - Flora, Fauna & Merryweather - come to the castle to bestow gifts on the child. However, the evil sorceress Maleficent also makes an appearance, and Merryweather's temper gets the better of her. She makes a rude statement that incites the sorceress to put a horrible curse on Aurora; that by the end of her 16th birthday, she will touch her finger to a poisoned spinning wheel - and DIE! Merryweather tries to undo the damage by altering the curse so that Aurora will instead be confined to an ageless sleep to be broken by love's 1st kiss. Wisely, however, the king orders that all spinning wheels in the kingdom be burned as a precaution, and the 3 fairies take Aurora to their cottage in the woods - away from Maleficent's spies - and raise her as their own child, named Briar Rose. On her 16th birthday Rose meets Prince Phillip - the son of a neighboring king whose own kingdom will soon unite with King Stefan's. When the 3 fairies get careless with their wands, Maleficent finds out Aurora's location and tricks her into touching a spinning wheel - and her evil prophecy is fulfilled! The sorceress then sets a trap in the cottage, and her army of brutes overpowers the Prince and takes him to Maleficent's castle on the Forbidden Mountain. The 3 fairies, upon discovering Phillip has been kidnapped, go to the Forbidden Mountain and set the Prince free. But it isn't long before they are spotted, and Maleficent's army of brutes attacks with arrows, rocks & boiling oil. The enraged Maleficent then directs her evil spells at the fleeing Prince - sending up a forest of thorns as thick as weeds to surround King Stefan's castle. When the Prince gets through, she lands on the road in front of him, blocking his path. Then comes one of the most terrifying scenes in Disney film - Maleficent turns herself into a massive, frightening dragon! She quickly drives Phillip back through the forest, and forces him onto a towering cliff, with no way out but down - into a raging pit of flame! The Prince then loses his shield with a blow from Maleficent's fiery breath. Will the Prince's bravery be enough to overcome Maleficent's evil powers?This is one of the more intense of the Disney films made in the classic age of Disney movies. In my view the artwork is far superior to the digital images of today, especially considering the painstaking effort that went into making them.9/10"
111,Sleeping Beauty,9,4 April 2003,Ambitious - it looks like live-action,"Sleeping Beauty, along with the modern series of Disney films beginning with ""Beauty & the Beast"" and stretching through to ""Treasure Planet"", breaks a lot of the old rules associated with animation. Widescreen? Why do you need widescreen in animation? Because it gives another layer of depth to the scene, not to mention the best, purest animation that the old school studio artists ever did. Earlier work like ""Snow White"", ""Pinnochio"", ""Dumbo"", ""Peter Pan"" -- all indisputably great, but they look like, well, cartoons. ""Sleeping Beauty"" looks like an actual film - rich in color, detail, staging, etc.And this is all, of course, rooted in one thing, which the unbelievably convincing artistry of the Disney staff in creating this world. The scene when Maleficent sneaks into Aurora's dressing room via the fireplace - with the dim lights, the chilly music, the perfectly timed explosion - it looks like Hitchcock more than Disney! The way the film furiously moves through its exciting rescue/battle climax, it looks like a mix of ""Ben-Hur"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", and  ""Casablanca"".
Endlessly watchable, loveable, enchanting...the list goes on. Four stars for ""Sleeping Beauty"", the best of the ""Classic"" Disney films"
112,Sleeping Beauty,9,2 February 2003,Eleanor Audley's performance saves Sleeping Beauty,"Without Maleficent, this film would be mediocre at best. But Maleficent's evil, horrifying personality elevates this film to a much higher degree, I believe only Jafar from Aladdin is a more evil Disney animated villain (others I might prefer for their comedy, complexity, etc., but in terms of pure wickedness, only Jafar can beat this witch). I consider the movie worthy of a 9/10 courtesy of Eleanor Audley."
113,Sleeping Beauty,,15 June 2002,Stunning!,"Personal Note: This was the first film I ever took a girl on a date to. When I was 12 or 13 in Petersburg Virginia, on summer day in the early 1970's, I took the daughter of one of my Grandad's friends to see this. Sadly, I have forgotten her name, and the theater is long gone, too.Back to my review:If you can't see this in wide screen format, pass on it, but if you CAN, do!As this was one of those great 70mm films, meant for a very big screen, this movie loses a great deal when seen on your average TV. I went on a kick before DVD got to be really big, of only buying the wide screen editions of movies on VHS. Yeah, it cost more, sometimes, but let me tell you, it's well worth it with ""Sleeping Beauty"".I stumbled upon a wide screen edition of this 1959 classic, and spent the rest of the day watching the incredible artwork. The backgrounds themselves, would be a feature alone! This would be the best example of non-computer enhanced artwork, ever.It is generally thought of as a failure in the box office department, but in the ""making of"" segment, it tells you that ""SB"" was the 2nd highest grossing films of 1959. If you want to see one of the best of Disney Classic (Pre-Little Mermaid) Era movies, get this!"
114,Sleeping Beauty,9,2 September 1999,Breathtaking,"In my mind, this is the most beautiful Disney film done while Walt was alive.  If you have seen the additional material attached to the most recent release on video, you are aware of the time and man hours that went into the film.  The stylizing of the film is a stroke of genius and the color and form lure you in.  I can remember as a child being fascinated by the visuals. This is truly an achievement in animation.  It is also worth it to hear Mary Costa's incredible singing voice."
115,Sleeping Beauty,9,27 July 1999,Beautiful sleeper,"I have yet to see `Sleeping Beauty' on a big, wide screen - I can only dream.  Of all animated films this one offers the most spectacle, the most astounding sights.  The downside is that production design wags the dog. This is a truly beautiful film; but it is also, I must admit, a little drowsy.  -Actually I'm simplifying a little.  Aurora and Phillip are ciphers, and they would have been ciphers whatever the art direction had been like; the story is not an enthralling story, and the art direction cannot be blamed for THAT, either.  At most the art direction stiffens and constrains Disney's animators a little.  But it gives us ample compensation. It's a strangely fertile cross-breed between square-angled medieval painting and animation styles of the 1950s.  It's an understatement to say that nothing else is quite like it.The score is adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet (and bits of his fifth symphony, and probably bits of other things), with the suggestion being, presumably, that since Tchaikovsky claimed this territory, nothing less than Tchaikovsky will now serve.  It adds to the ornate grandeur, certainly. (Tchaikovsky is not always ideally treated, though, when lyrics are set to his tunes.)Of all the studio's animated films this one is closest in spirit to a fairytale.  It's mesmerising rather than involving.  We can forgive it much because it so clearly believes in itself."
116,Sleeping Beauty,9,4 May 2002,It gets better every time I see it. Just perfect.,"This movie is just perfect, although it might not be for very small kids (believe me, the image of Maleficent and Briar Rose going upstairs to yonder topmost tower surrounded by that creepy green light nearly ruins my childhood, hah hah). The music is suitable for every scene, and they really got it when they decided to use Tchaickovsky´s ballet for ""Sleeping Beauty"". A great adaptation. The script really gets it. That careful use of words, that magnificent lyrics are inmortal. But hey... it´s the villain who steals the show! I tell you that Maleficent is the most remembered character of the whole movie, even more than Aurora/Briar Rose. Such coldness, elegance and wickedness is something quite unforgettable. The animation and surrounding is also incredible. Such a different kind of characters, such a greatness in the use of color and in the surrounds... It´s surely the best Disney movie in that respect, including Beauty and the Beast. A glorious movie for everyone, and certainly of the best pictures cinema has ever given birth to. Don´t miss it!RATE: 10/10It might not happen in the USA, but in Spain ""Sleeping Beauty"" DVD cannot be seen in 16:9, although it is said so in the box!"
117,Sleeping Beauty,,5 November 2000,A True Masterpiece,"Sleeping Beauty was not initially a success on it's first release. Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's lesser known, or at least lesser seen masterpieces. Deciding on a number one Disney spot would be a very hard thing for me to do, what with such great movies such as Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid and of course... Sleeping Beauty. Everything about this movie is brilliant: the story, the music, the characters, the ending, the humor, the animation. Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip are probably the prettiest animated characters of all time. The three fairies: Flora, Fauna and especially Merryweather provide most the comedy for this magnificent film. Not to mention that my all time favorite Disney villain (and villain in general) is found in this movie: Maleficent. There have been many great Disney villains, all of them evil in their own ways. But there is something about Maleficent, she is cruel to everyone (even her own 'goons') and her face and her dress are very intimidating, not to mention her powers. The Dragon-slaying scene is one of my favorite 'killing the villain' scenes. As far as music goes: The score based on Tchaikovsky's original score is beautiful, not to mention the unforgettable song ""Once Upon a Dream"". I myself see this as one of Disney's true masterpieces- definitely the best Disney film from Walt's days. Whether you are 5 or 125 years old you will love this classic. Young audiences will love it and older audiences will enjoy the magnificent animation, the brilliant score, the unforgettable story, the lovable characters... the best Prince-Princess story. I don't think Disney could ever make a ""They lived happily ever after"" type story again and that is why we must appreciate the classics left from the past, Sleeping Beauty being (in my opinion) the best of them all. A movie worthy of being in anybody's collection, I give Sleeping Beauty the highest possible rating, it's a beautiful unforgettable masterpiece."
118,Sleeping Beauty,9,2 June 2000,A genuine classic from Disney chest of treasures,"**some possible spoilers** Sleeping Beauty is a true classic in every sense.  It`s got great heroes, great villains, great animation and beautiful locations, great music and atmosphere and a classic lovestory of a brave knight and a beautiful princess. Princess Aurora is cursed by an evil fairy, who wants Aurora to die on her 16th birthday.  Three good fairies take her away from the king, in order to bring her up safely, and to bring her back to the king`s castle on her 16th birthday. Aurora grows up to become a beautiful young woman, and she falls in love with a prince, which she meets in the forest. Sleeping Beauty is a classic story.  There are classic scenes like a fight with a dragon and so on.  But as in all fairytales,  the good side wins in the end. An old favorite and definetely a rentable movie for both young and adult. 9/10"
119,Sleeping Beauty,10,9 March 2000,A Spectacular Animation Masterpiece,"Ever since I first saw this film as a child, I have loved it.  It is not quite as popular as some of the other Disney love stories, but it definitely deserves to be.  The artistry and style of the movie is unsurpassed to this day.  It is worthy of being called art, in my opinion.  The music of Sleeping Beauty is also beyond compare  (I love it so much, my husband and I danced to the Sleeping Beauty Waltz for our first dance at our wedding). Disney, or any other studio for that matter, has yet to create another masterpiece to rival Sleeping Beauty."
120,Sleeping Beauty,3,20 January 2008,I find it too fake to be believed,"Finally saw the Disney Sleeping Beauty tonight on ABC. I didn't think I'd like it so I never watched it.I was right.Granted the print was washed out, which is surprising since the film was just restored for DVD. The film was also the first widescreen and 70mm feature animated cartoon from Disney so watching the film was a trip since stuff was obviously off screen.I love Malificent and the dragon but for the most part I don't like the look of the film. Its too cartoony at times while other things like the design of the prince's face seems oddly out of place with the rest of the film. Yes he;'s closer to Malificent who is realistic, but everyone else is cartoon.(and I won't mention the horse) The pallet is closer to some of UPA films. It all feels mechanical.I intensely dislike the fact that basically the hero isn't very heroic, oh yes he does the hero stuff but he would have failed almost from the start had the fairies not been there. Even killing the dragon is done by the fairies. I will not read into this the feminist subtext of behind every man is a good woman, or in this case three. What a wimp.No there will be no rush by me to run out and pick up the film on DVD. I can only thank god that I do not have girlfriend/wife or female children who would make me watch this again. No its not as bad as say, oh, an Ed Wood movie, and no its just not that bad at all, its just fake magical and over rated.I hope never to see it again."
121,Sleeping Beauty,5,23 September 2014,Well known fairy tale that is forgettable,"This is a really simple story that doesn't seem to have all that much screen time when it comes to Sleeping Beauty. The character is just a super mystery to me, all I know is that she is royalty, she sings to forest animals and is interested in a Prince. Yeah, that is mostly any typical Disney princess, but nothing about Sleeping Beauty stands out. And the people that recognize her, only seem to recognize her for her beauty. Maleficent is the villain this time around, but nothing is really known about her. And her motives and incentives for her evil deeds just doesn't stand out much. As a matter of fact, when the movie ends I questioned her motives for what she did. But that is later more explained in ""Maleficent"" the live action movie. The tale of the Sleeping Beauty is a well known fairy tale, but I personally thought this animated Disney movie was actually quite forgettable. I give this movie a 5.4/10 because the animation was ahead of it's time.5.4/10"
122,Sleeping Beauty,10,13 May 2008,This Is Art,"The phrase ""style over substance"" comes up often in criticism, and Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY is no exception. The story is admittedly-thin, and the characters are fairly shallow. The title character, Princess Aurora, is really a supporting character, and it's the three fairies who instead carry the story. The great ""romance"" of the movie consists of one awkward conversation between the prince and princess, and then they live happily ever after once she awakens, without saying so much as a word.But I don't say this as a condemnation. The old Disney fairy tales were never known for their depth. In fact, I would say it wasn't until BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, THE LION KING, POCAHONTAS, and THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME that Disney animation really began to have depth of plot and far more developed female characters. Audiences themselves have matured over time.What does make SLEEPING BEAUTY stand out is its stylized approach. The animation resembles medieval paintings, the music is by Tchaikovsky, and the tone of the narrative is lyrical and sombre. Take a scene where Aurora sings with the animals. This scene of course is a Disney convention (the recent film ENCHANTED poked fun of it). But frankly, this time the scene is superior to its counterpart in SNOW WHITE or Cinderella, due to the haunting quality of the song ""I Wonder"" and Mary Costa's ethereal vocals. The entire sequence is hypnotic, and resembles a ballet more than a cartoon. It is soon followed by a stand alone sequence worthy of a standing ovation, in which Aurora falls under an enchantment, bathed in a sinister green glow, making her way towards the cursed spinning wheel.But no review of this movie is ever complete without a mention of one character who I've been saving. As many have said before me, Maleficent remains the best villain in the Disney canon. She is not goofy or slapstick-ish as later Disney villains became, but calm and calculating. To me, her best scene is one where she is not even doing something menacing, but instead shows her restrained sadism; she visits the imprisoned prince and shows him a vision of his likely future, mentally tormenting him. As she exits the cell, she comments that she will now sleep well for the first time in sixteen years. Such was the extent of her obsession of power.As a kid, not only was I scared of her; I was scared of even looking at the video box cover, just because she was in the bottom right corner! At a mere 75 minutes, this movie holds everything that made the Disney legacy worthwhile. It has humor, darkness, enchantment, and a sense of wonder at a world we will never inhabit. It is a sleeping beauty to behold."
123,Sleeping Beauty,10,26 October 2006,Disney's Greatest Film,"This is my absolute favorite Disney movie ever! As a little girl, I would watch this captivating love story time and again, and I still watch it, and I love every moment. This movie has everything a Disney story should have; comedy, drama, love, hate, good, evil, and most importantly--music! Disney writers today do not write their own music (they use pop music that stinks) and also, though the movies are directed at a young audience, the jokes and puns in the movies are often only understood by adults, and they go straight over the children's heads.Anyway, i love the songs in this film. I love Tchaikovsky, and the lyrics that the Disney writers accompanied along with them is just spectacular! The art is very unique, in that the aimators imitated Medieval artwork. No other Disney production used that technique. I also think Prince Philip is the most handsome Disney male and Aurora is the most beautiful Disney female. This is the quintessential Disney movie. A 10. Superb. The Best."
124,Sleeping Beauty,10,4 September 2006,The best Disney cartoon ever made!!!,This is and will always be the best Disney cartoon ever made. First of all it is a classic. A simple classic story. The problem with all new Disney films is they will never be classics. They are modern day stories aimed at merchandising. Merchandising was not the main objective in this film. It was all about bringing smiles and scarred faces to kids all over the world. To put them in that world and tramatize them for life with the evil Malifacent. NOW THATS COOOL!!! She didn't have the annoying old ladies choir voice that Snow White did. A major improvement. The animation was so fluid and had it's own style. 24 frames a second as apposed to now days 9 frames. Yuck! The colors were amazing in this film. They also found ways to make the scenery and backdrops move. The music will always be amazing. Never again will we see an animated classic like this one. Disney has fired almost all of their paint and brush animators so films in the digital domain will produce much faster.
125,Sleeping Beauty,10,10 March 2003,Disney animation attains perfection,"What more can I say than what is said above? Sleeping Beauty is the perfect Disney animated feature. I have loved it since I was a small boy and have never stopped loving it. It has the perfect musical score (adapted from Tchaikovsky), absolutely gorgeous Technicolor, and was shot in Technirama. Much as I love other Disney films from this early period, this one still stands out as being the most beautiful and least dated. It is simply a beauty to behold, and needs to be seen more often. On the dress front, I always thought Aurora looked better in blue. 'Nuff said."
126,Sleeping Beauty,9,13 September 2001,Scary Maleficent.,"This is my favourite Disney movie.I saw it when I was 8,and that was the first movie which scared me to death.Back home at night,I was afraid of the dark,I could not turn off the light,because I was afraid of Maleficent.One scene would go well in any horror movie:Princess Aurora ,spellbound,comes up the stairs,and arrives in a room.Maleficent is hidden in the fireplace,you can only see her eyes..Absolutely frightening!I saw it again at 18,and although I had grown up(!) I was scared almost the same way.I cannot think of any baddie ,any villain in the Mouse House that can equal this witch.She's got some kind of vamp's face-not as ugly as Snowwhite's evil queen-,and her horns add to her satanic(sadistic) look.When she becomes a dragon,the terror she generates is not as intense because a dragon remains a dragon,even if it's more successful than Mim's metamorphosis in ""Sword in the stone"".The rest of the movie seems rather nice,compared to the movie's baddie.Tchaikowsky's waltz is tastefully used ,and adds lustre to a pretty bland pair of lovers.The three good fairies-three Cinderella's godmothers for the price of one- are funny and charming and God knows how much we need them as a relief in the nightmarish world of Maleficent and her demons.A question remains:at the time,was it really a movie for children?Now time has passed ,the kids have seen worse.But I keep on thinking it was a bit too much for the brat I was in 1960."
127,Sleeping Beauty,6,4 February 2015,Just not all that fun compared to most other similar Disney films,"I appreciated one reviewer who said that they thought this film was perhaps targeted more to adults. As a child, I really didn't like this film and thought maybe it was just me, but over the years I've learned that others grew up feeling the same way. The prettier and more detailed Disney animation of the 30s and 40s here gives way to a much simpler and more garishly colored art style that screams 'MODERN'--but lacks charm. As for the film's plot and characters, aside from Maleficent, the rest are an incredibly dull and cheerless group. Princess whatsherface is dull and like too many Disney princesses, is way too passive--waiting for a hero-type to rescue her. All in all, I don't hate this film but there isn't much to make me like it, either. I have no idea why this film has achieved classic status other than it is old."
128,Sleeping Beauty,6,18 June 2013,"Beautiful, but not quite a must-see Disney movie","Compared to other classic installments in Disney's hand-drawn canon, this movie has relatively few standout characters or memorable moments. The villain, thrillingly dark, is one who could have put her stamp on the story had she been given more scenes. The prince and princess are ciphers, but the scene in which they meet in the forest is beautifully done and tinged with an Old World mystique that more recent Disney titles have sadly lacked. The art in ""Sleeping Beauty"" is of high quality, reminiscent of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937), which employs similar settings. ""Sleeping Beauty"" is a fun and nostalgic watch for fans of classic Disney, but is not one of the studio's must-see titles."
129,Sleeping Beauty,5,8 July 2012,Another Disney movie I never liked very much.,"I find the artwork very interesting in this one and I appreciated it as a child as well. The fairies were cute, but not enough screen-time was given to them in my opinion. My favorite scene in the movie is when they sew the dress, it was very entertaining as well.Most of the movie however seems very slow, dreary and boring. When I was a child, I found the ending way too dark and it also spanned for a very long time in the movie. I would rather have seen more of the fairies and Aurora. The only song I remember is ""Once upon a dream"". Many of the characters aren't very interesting either, I remember there is a very long scene with the kings having a toast and the only mildly entertaining was the bard. As I remember it, there's a lot of dialog in this movie that obviously wasn't interesting enough for me to remember while I can quote most things from ""The Little Mermaid""."
130,Sleeping Beauty,,29 January 2009,Overpraised Disney production,"This was a disappointment for me. Perhaps it was because I saw it on DVD, but the whole thing just didn't work. The animation appeared square and blocky. Both Sleeping Beauty and her bland prince were sugary sweet and completely boring. The much touted action climax with a fiery dragon was alright but hardly worth all the hype. Most of the film deals wit the three kindly fairy godmothers. They are pleasant to watch, although much of their dialog is superfluous to the plot. One plus point: the music. I will probably give this a second watch to see why others praise it so much.Overall 6/10"
131,Sleeping Beauty,2,5 January 2009,Bizarre religious background,"Fundamentalists like to pretend that the America of the 1950s (of their fathers' or grandfather's time) was an America made in their image, from which we have fallen away. What a strange idea with the culture dominated by figures like Einstein or Oppenheimer, by the Beats, and even by the likes of Tom Lehrer.Disney might seem to typify the bland, image of mindless conformity of the 1950s beloved now of so many, but his labor that decade, Sleeping Beauty tells a far different story.It is remarkable that a story set so clearly in Western Christendom in the fourteenth century could be so utterly devoid of references to Christianity. Even the fact that the celebration with which the film begins is Sleeping Beauty's christening has been suppressed. Presumably this was done to avoid offense, to keep the mainly Protestant audience from having to deal with the fact that all of the characters in the film are Catholic. But it is taken to extremes. The logical end of the film would have been the wedding, but just when it seems that the ceremony is about to be performed (no Bishop in sight, though), the prince and princess start dancing (in fact, waltzing, but better not to go into that), as if the whole need for the marriage has been elided away and the feast already begun.But religion is hardly absent from the film, quite the opposite, everything in it is dominated by 'pagan' fairy beliefs. There is never any prayer, any intercession, any sacrament, shown in the film, but it is full of fairies with miraculous powers who know nothing of Jesus. The closest approach to Christianity is the quite radical dualism between the two camps of fairies. These fairies are the spiritual entities that the human characters look to for aid (it is true they provide the prince with a magical shield bearing a cross, but this is referred as 'the shield of virtue' rather than of faith). In fact, the film is so thoroughly pagan that I seriously wonder if it did not play a role in establishing the mindset in its young viewers that welcomes neo-paganism and the New Age?One scene, however, caught my attention and indeed prompted this vignette. After the infant Sleeping Beauty is cursed, the three good fairies meet together to make plans about how to mitigate her enchantment. Before they begin their discussions they decide it is best to conceal themselves from prying eyes. Where do they go? Bearing in mind that they are the size of insects, they enter a tabernacle, that is, the small box used to store Catholic altar ware and even the consecrated wafers. They go into the little space (since it is in the king's chapel everything is made of gold and encrusted with gems) and make their plans, all the while playing like children on playground equipment on the ciborium (host container), paten (tray for catching sacred crumbs), chalice and other sacred equipment. It is a surreal scene of blasphemy worthy of Bunuel. It is made clear that no host is actually present at the time (though there usually is one wafer in a monstrance in a tabernacle), but what could they have been thinking when they animated the scene?"
132,Sleeping Beauty,5,11 May 2006,What if an entire entity slept for 100 years in real life?,"You know the drill: witch puts death curse on princess, fairy softens it to sleep, and whole castle goes to sleep. As I learned in a fairy tale class in Lewis & Clark College just this past semester, some people think that the original fairy tale may have been about sexual maturation, the way she goes to sleep and wakes up a new person. Certainly sleep is a non-productive period, providing an opportunity for rebirth, perhaps? As for the spindle, that presents an interesting aspect: spinning was almost exclusively done by peasant women, so was it saying that if a princess tries to engage in it, strange things will happen? Does the curse mean that she'll never be able to do work that women are supposed to do? And the whole part about getting pricked by it: was that a sexual innuendo? The whole part about the castle shutting down while she sleeps provides food for thought. While we were discussing ""Sleeping Beauty"" and its variants in the fairy tale class in early April, I noted that if an entire castle - or other such entity - had fallen asleep exactly one century earlier and just now woken up, they would have missed the entire 20th century (and specifically, they would have just missed the Great San Francisco Earthquake). So, everyone on earth would have to explain everything that happened throughout the 20th century and first few years of the 21st century (I would hope to be the one to explain popular culture). I just imagine the people from the entity being all like: ""Whoa. That was one weird century that we missed. So no one ever found Jimmy Hoffa?"" What I'd like to see happen when everyone goes to sleep is a ""Psycho"" spoof. Someone's walking down the street, when suddenly, s/he feels tired. The ""Psycho"" music starts playing. With his/her last bit of strength before dozing off, s/he grabs a towel, and pulls a bottle of red wine off of a counter. The bottle crashes to the ground and the wine runs down into a drain.Back to the movie itself. There's pretty much everything that we can expect in a Disney version of a fairy tale: the virtuous princess is beautiful (or at least what our society considers beautiful), the cool prince is one handsome dude, the evil witch wears all black (remember, this is before anyone thought about political correctness) and talks like Endora on ""Bewitched"", the good fairies have the sort of relationship with each other than Gilligan and the Skipper have with each other, and the side characters exist mainly for comic relief. The movie really sets itself up to get mocked, and I threw out comments at it like Mike, Servo and Crow do with the movies that Dr. Forrester sends them on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Among my comments were: (when Prince Philip offers his horse extra oats and carrots): ""Bribery?! Duke Cunningham went to jail for that!""*; (when the good fairies are talking about how Maleficent only understands hate and evil): ""Gee, Maleficent sounds like the Bush administration."" The whole part about the fairies trying to live like ""mortals"" sounds so much like ""Bewitched"" that it's debatable whether that's worth joking about. And when someone describes the 14th century as ""the present""...well, let's just say that in the 14th century, I couldn't have written this review because IMDb.com didn't exist! Anyway, I guess that this is mainly worth seeing as a look at that era in cinema. I will admit that Aurora is pretty hot.*In case you haven't been following the news, Duke Cunningham was a congressman (and Jack Abramoff crony) who recently got sent to jail for accepting bribes. When Walt Disney first released ""Sleeping Beauty"", he probably never guessed that someone would review it and mention those creeps. But hey, this is the 21st century, so what this movie portrays becomes even more of a fantasy."
133,Sleeping Beauty,5,4 October 2017,Not anything to really care about,"This movie was so boring until the very ending. The music is forgettable and Aurora (Sleeping Beauty) is the worst Disney princess she has nothing going for her in anyway. Her voice isn't too good, her looks don't really stand out and she has no character development I mean she's only in 18 minutes of the film. This was wasted potential she could have been better if they tried. The only thing that saves this movie from being utter trash is Maleficent. Her humor I funny and she is a delight to watch as well as watching the prince go out to save the princess. Trust me all you have to do is watch the first 10 mins and the skip to the last 30 mineutes and you will perfectly fine."
134,Sleeping Beauty,9,15 August 2017,Misses the mark due to a weak prince. Terrific Dragon!,"The stylized animation is not my cup-of-tea. At the end of the film, the Prince has nothing-to-say and there appears to be some dialogue missing? Otherwise, beautifully drawn with the usual fantastic eye-popping pallet of amazing ""Technicolor"". Not one of my favorites, but oh! that dragon! As a little kid, on a ""glorious black and white TV"", it gave me nightmares. Personality is everything and the Prince comes off as totally wooden in character. The great (adapted) Tchaikovsky Ballet music. Only 1 significant Oscar nominated song (""I Know You""). Today,it being made in ""Technirama 70"" widescreen is no big deal, but the format gave the artists many production headaches. The story is otherwise very well told but there are so many Disney animations (and movies) that I like so much better. Yes, it is the animation style. The backgrounds look terrible. That's what is wrong with it. Also, it somehow looks rushed-to-market. (Only 75 minutes long.) Read more about the ""trials and tribulations"" regarding this troubled production in ""The Art of Walt Disney"". It almost dragged Walt Disney Studios into financial ruin with its cost overruns! Almost ""out-of-print"" except for ridiculously over-priced $35 copies, some not even Blu-Ray. A 2014 disc reissue apparently was very successful or demand was under-anticipated?"
135,Sleeping Beauty,6,7 May 2017,Animation from Disney's golden age,"SLEEPING BEAUTY is a Walt Disney animation that harks back to the golden age of the studio, before it became a populist sell-out for the masses. I'm no fan of these twee animations in general, but even I can admit that this is a well-made and well-animated production, questionable morals aside. Certainly the 1950s concerns of the day - presenting beauty as the main thing to be wished for by a girl - are dated, sexist, and old-fashioned, but this is also what makes the film an interesting time capsule.The film features one too many cute animals for my liking, and the handsome prince is a dolt. I found the protagonist rather smug and irritating. But the fairy godmothers are endearing creations and the use of the Tchaikovsky soundtrack is very good, although I would have preferred to listen to the straight music without the addition of the needless sung lines. Still, the character of Maleficent is one of the most striking in all Disney, and SLEEPING BEAUTY is a harmless enough piece of entertainment for the masses."
136,Sleeping Beauty,8,29 April 2017,"Now deal with me, and all the powers of HELL!!!","That is my favorite quote from this Disney classic. Disney really didn't shy away from being real and didn't try to stay completely G rated. And I love that about this film. Maleficent is an excellent villainous, she has the perfect evil look and the voicing is great too, fits the character well. The fairies are great lovable characters. I always forget which is which but I know they're flora fauna and maryweather, hope I didn't butcher the names lol. But anyways, the fairies that guard and look after Aurora as a child are very colorful and fun characters which makes the movie overall more fun and fitting for kids to love. Aurora is an alright Disney princess, I don't know she's just not a very good character to me personally. Now I did like Prince Philip as a character, he's a charming lovable male love interest. I would've liked the romance between Aurora and Philip better if Aurora wasn't so bland and boring as a character. Aurora really is the only part of the movie I just don't really care for. The rest is great and very entertaining. This is yet another Disney movie that I do recommend for a fun family movie night. The action is fun and engaging and I especially loved the special effects, they're the best when it comes to Maleficent. 8/10."
137,Sleeping Beauty,,9 October 2016,"Not up to some other Disney animated movies, but still worth a look","At the time of its initial release, ""Sleeping Beauty"" not only got a somewhat unenthusiastic response from critics, its box office gross was not enough to recover its extremely high costs. However, the movie almost certainly has made a profit over the years, and critics today have a more positive viewpoint towards it. It's an interesting movie in several regards, being that it was made right between the classic animation style and the more modern style that was coming out around that time. The animation and art design is very striking, with strong colors (see this movie on Blu-ray - it looks fantastic.) It's also a more serious-minded animated movie compared to most other Disney movies before (or since), and this gives the movie a more mature feel (though the tone will still seem palatable to children.) However, there is a notable flaw that holds back the movie from true greatness - the script. For example, while the movie only runs 75 minutes long, there is some obvious and considerable padding. Another problem is that the characters are somewhat thin - the princess hardly gets a chance to say anything or to make herself a multi-dimensional character. And Maleficent also doesn't get much of a chance to show motivation or any other real character traits. But kids probably won't mind about such problems, and their parents will still be reasonably entertained."
138,Sleeping Beauty,10,6 October 2016,Hail to the princess Aurora,"The most beautiful Disney movie (later parodied in Rapunzel, which itself, with all its hilariousness and high spirits, is a movie meme). One of the most beautiful Disney princesses, as well: chaste, kind, delicate (if one can say so about a cartoon character - but I think one can!) The noble king's daughter, which at the same time is a simple barefoot peasant girl, both charming and modest. (Only in the 60th, I guess, could such a character emerge onto the big screen). Not to mention the dreadful Queen of Darkness, her devils, which are truly ugly and frightful... And the moment when she grows up into something incredibly dark and enormous, up to the very clouds (you want, in spite of yourself, to close the eyes and not to see). But the Sword of Truth will not fail prince Philip; the hard-to-win evil Thing shall be destroyed. It's a shame the legendary movie was later duplicated and even multiplicated in tasteless fakes ('The Swan Princess', with an awkward queen Huberta, for instance). But The Sleeping Beauty remains with us. It can be watched and re-watched. I think it will be. For long..."
139,Sleeping Beauty,8,25 May 2015,Very mixed feelings,"I'm rating this movie an 8 because it does many things incredibly well. Overall, however, it has some flaws I can't overlook, mainly story and character. To begin, it has one of the great villains in Maleficent, and her scenes are incredibly satisfying. The voice work from Eleanor Audrey always transports me. The three fairies are classic Disney characters, but their roles feel too prominent. Aurora, the title character, is slight, but I still end up liking her once her first major scene gets going. The backgrounds are incredible, especially in the forest. There was a lot of effort put into the art and animation, and it brings to life the feeling of listening to my grandmother reading from a collection of fair tales. The final act, especially the climactic battle with the dragon, is epic. The movie ends on just the right note, but when I reflect back on the whole of it, it feels incomplete. I have this sense that this could have been a perfect movie, but gave us a bit too little."
140,Sleeping Beauty,6,23 September 2014,"Not the strongest Disney classic, but not the weakest either.","This is not the strongest of the Disney classics, but it is in no means the weakest. I remember watching this film as a kid and getting freaked out by Maleficent. After revisiting Sleeping Beauty, I still get the creeps. The music is perfect in meshing with the action, making the happy moments happier, and the scary moments scarier. Some detriments to this movie are that it wasted a lot of time on insignificant scenes, thus dragging out the movie and lowering the overall enjoyment of the film. I didn't really care for the characters as much as I do for other Disney characters, which is a result of fair buildup and poor character development. Along with those detriments, the merits I believe this movie possesses are a soundtrack that brings life to every scene, and the most frightening and darkest of the Disney villains."
141,Sleeping Beauty,5,8 June 2014,The last fairytale in Walt Disney's era until the next 30 odd years,"Sleeping Beauty is Walt Disney's 16th Disney animated fairy-tale and tells the tale of a beautiful princess named Aurora who has an evil curse on her set by Maleficent(who I think is one of the best villains of all time as she is so evil and so manipulative,compare to Angelina Jolie's version which sees a softer side to her)that on the eve of Aurora's 16th birthday she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and be put to sleep until true love's kiss can break it. So Aurora's 3 fairies decide to turn themselves into ordinary peasant women and raise the child as their own(again we have this in nearly EVERY Disney movie from The Hunchback Of Notre Dame,to Tangled),but when Aurora meets a handsome prince called Phillip,she may be leading herself and him in danger as she goes under the guise of Briar Rose,so that Maleficent won't be able to find her,but will Maleficent find her and will Aurora be awakened by true love's kiss?So lets start with the good in this movie,the animation in this movie is very beautiful to look at and Aurora is beautiful but that's it she's just some beautiful chick but she lacks in personality as she rarely even talks in this movie and that is the bad in this film,as beautiful as the film looks it lacks with our heroine and her prince as they NEVER talk for the last 30 or 40 minutes at the end of the film all Aurora does is sleep and Prince Phillip doesn't even say the likes of 'Fear not my maiden I shall strike and kill Maleficent with my mighty sword' whatever they use in that century.So do I like this movie.............well I do but its not the BEST FILM EVER made. But at least we got The Little Mermaid 30 years later which would be the start of a New Disney renaissance.If you love your silent movies than check this out if not than avoid.5.4 out of 10"
142,Sleeping Beauty,6,18 April 2013,5th out of 8 in the Silver Era,"About 4 years after Lady and the Tramp and with the 50s coming to an end, Sleeping Beauty was released.The story is about three fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merrywether who has to watch over Princess Aurora for 16 years to protect her from Maleficent's curse. On her 16th birthday, Aurora meets and falls in love with Prince Philip. After the fairies returned Aurora to the castle, Aurora is cursed and Phillip needs to kiss her to wake her up, but first needs to fight Maleficent.This movie has the most boring characters yet, as everybody except the fairies and to an extent Maleficent are extremely bland. Aurora is in the movie for about 18 minutes in the film, and all she does is sing, dance with animals and Phillip, cries when she has to marry the Prince, and wheels after getting cursed. You do not get to see her character, and she is a typical princess in distress. Phillip is an improvement above the previous princes, but no by much; he gets a name, and has a bit more lines than they do. He appears in the film longer, but he only speaks in half of his scenes, and is still bland. Maleficent is dark, creepy, and cruel, but there is a part of her that is also boring and bland. The parents are just your royal parents who want to marry their kids off. The fairies are the only saving grace; Flora is the bossy one, Fauna is the peace keeper, and Merryweather is a loudmouth. The few songs that are in the movie are very good. ""I Wonder/Once Upon a Dream"" is sung beautifully, and definitely brings out the medieval style in the songs and the score. The animation also gulfs itself in the medieval theme, and this is definitely the best animated Disney film yet. Each frame is a piece of art, and you could pause the movie anywhere, print screen it, and you have a piece of art, but unfortunately, songs and animation does not make a good movie.The story has a few plot holes, but even if it did not, the movie is extremely boring, and it is very easy to drift off. This also has to do with the mostly boring cast of characters. The animation and songs are beautiful, but everything else falls flat. If you want to watch a classic Disney Princess film, a medieval themed movie, and a beautifully animated movie, give this movie a watch, but don't expect to get too invested in the film"
143,Sleeping Beauty,6,21 April 2011,If it weren't for these silly fairies I would have loved it,"I haven't seen this one as a kid and I have no idea why. I love this fairy tale though. Seeing it as an adult I expected something along the lines of Snow White and Cinderella.Indeed princess Aurora does have a scene where she sings and dances with some animals, which seem to be obligatory in Disney movies about princesses. But I think that's where the comparison stops. The humor is mostly provided by the fairies which is a good thing for children. The problem is not so much that the fairies are silly but that they take such an important role in the story having more screen time than princess Aurora who is supposed to be the real star. That the marriage between Aurora and prince Philip was a politically arranged one took away from the charm of how I remembered it as kid. However I liked the fact they gave him some more background than in the original fairy tale. What really disappointed me was the role of Aurora's mother which was pretty non-existent. It is completely taken over by the fairies. Scenes taking place in the castle are completely into the hands of the father. Aurora doesn't know she is a princess, doesn't have any bond with her parents while she had such a strong relationship with her mother in the original tale. Good that Maleficent was such a convincingly scary villain or otherwise I wouldn't think of ever watching this one again. Giving it a 6 seems to be much given my ranting but that is mostly because I didn't like the changes they made to the original tale. Others might have loved this different approach and it seems fresh but it wasn't for me. It wasn't a bad movie just not what I expected or hoped."
144,Sleeping Beauty,7,7 December 2010,"I was expecting a bit more, but still got a decent Disney princess movie","The first animated Disney feature was 1937's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", so it started with a princess movie, and more than one of those followed. When I finally watched ""Enchanted"" about three months ago, I did not like it at all, and could not imagine a second viewing changing my opinion, but since that film is based on the Disney princess movies, I was reminded that even though I had revisited ""Snow White"" three years earlier, I didn't have much memory of the Disney versions of ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"". After that, it wasn't long before I gave the 1950 release a watch, and I didn't recognize much of it, but still thought it was pretty good. That also turned out to be the case when I watched this 1959 feature.King Stefan and Queen Leah give birth to a daughter, and she is named Aurora. At her christening ceremony, the three good fairies, Fauna, Flora, and Merryweather, come to bless her with one gift each. From Flora, Princess Aurora gets the gift of beauty, and Fauna gives the newborn princess the gift of song, but then the evil Maleficent appears and curses the infant so she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle and die before sunset on her sixteenth birthday! After the evil fairy leaves, Merryweather still has her blessing to give, and she cannot stop the curse, but she can weaken it. She changes it so when Aurora pricks her finger, she will not die, but will instead fall asleep until she is awakened by true love's kiss. After the ceremony, the three good fairies decide to hide the princess by taking her away from the castle and living as peasants for the next sixteen years, raising her in a woodland cottage. When Aurora, now called Briar Rose, turns sixteen, Maleficent's minions can't seem to find her, but the evil fairy is determined to have her found and have the sinister prophecy fulfilled! Fauna, Flora, and Merryweather make their first appearance in the film near the beginning, and there was something about these characters that made them seem a bit bland to me. Maybe they're supposed to be funnier than I found them to be. The part showing sixteen year old Aurora walking through the forest with her animal friends and singing as Prince Phillip comes nearer gets a little tiring, and so do the scenes showing the fairies trying to make a gown and cake for the princess, though the fight over whether to make the gown pink or blue is funny. Not everything about this version of ""Sleeping Beauty"" is that good, but there's still enough to like. The backgrounds are beautiful, especially in the forest, and there are some good moments of comic relief, the first one probably being the first scene showing Maleficent in her castle with her minions, learning that they've been looking for a baby all along. Also, Prince Phillip's father, King Hubert, can be a good character for laughs. There aren't as many laughs here as there are in many other Disney efforts, but there certainly are some. Even with the positive elements I've mentioned, the movie would still be pretty dull for the most part without a good plot which gets exciting, but fortunately, it has that as well.Watching this after Disney's ""Cinderella"", I was expecting it to be better that that film, especially since it isn't the one with the high-pitched talking mice, but after watching them both from start to finish, I would say they're basically equal in quality. Neither is as good as the Disney version of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", which preceded both of them, but they are decent princess movies for the family nonetheless. So, while I don't think this ""Sleeping Beauty"" is the masterpiece many Disney fans might think it is, it's still another entertaining fairy tale adaptation from the early decades of the Disney animated features. I'm quite sure I only ever saw a little bit of this is a kid, which would have been in the 1990s, but I'm sure many viewers through the generations have enjoyed it both as kids and as adults, so as usual with these popular animated movies, this one is not restricted to any specific age group."
145,Sleeping Beauty,6,27 November 2010,Almost a classic,"Sleeping Beauty had the highest budget of all the Disney movies at the time and it showed. The design of the characters and the settings is so exquisite at times it feels like you are watching cartoon characters in REAL places. I wish movie studios still made cartoons that looked like this. The other highlight of the film is Maleficent, the evil witch. She had the best character design in the film. She was performed by Eleanor Audley, also famous for playing Cinderella's stepmother, one of the best voice actors in Disney history. Maleficent is probably the best villain from Disney's classic era. Her transformation into a Dragon is the most memorable scene in the film. Beyond that, there really isn't much going for this film. The biggest problem is the lack of a strong main character. Aurora is asleep for most of the film, which was unavoidable, but they could have at least given the Prince a bigger role. The three fairies become the main characters by default, and while they make for an entertaining trio, they're just not enough to fill the void. Once Upon a Dream, the film's theme song, is only memorable for the Tchaikovsky music it is set to. Compared to classics like ""Someday my Prince will come"" and ""When you Wish Upon a Star,"" it does not compare.It's still worth watching for the animation and Maleficent, but it's not surprising that this film has been overshadowed."
146,Sleeping Beauty,7,24 October 2010,C.S. Lewis was right,"There is a lot to like about ""Sleeping Beauty."" If you are in the mood to listen to bits of the Tchaikovskï ballet and look at pretty pictures at the same time, this is the place to be. The action is wonderfully attuned to the musical rhythm and the visuals are fully worthy of the audio accompaniment. No animated feature even comes close to this in terms of both artistic skill and immaculate taste. Princess Aurora is without a doubt the most beautiful of the Disney princesses.Regrettably, Aurora's beauty and lovely singing voice are about the only things one can say about her. The original story (first-part only) is, as with other Disney features, altered significantly to make it more producible and fleshed-out for a two-hour film, but in expanding the role of the Good Fairies, Disney condemned himself to reducing their number: it would hardly have been conceivable to explore the personalities of the seven in the original story. Consequently, the original six gifts--beauty, kindness, grace, dance, song and instrumentality--are reduced to simply beauty and song. Was this intentional?Still, the presentation of royal mentality and obligation is remarkable for a twentieth-century American film, and the wicked fairy Maleficent is by far the best Disney villain: truly wicked and yet herself graceful and sleek--apparently a powerful noble peer of the kingdom of Stefan and Leah. She is the perfect foil for the Good Fairies, whose personalities and ethereal generosity might call to mind a kind group of religious sisters.Overall, a decent take that does not totally degrade the themes and symbols of the original, despite a bit of watering down on the ""love's first kiss"" bit and a rather unexploited personality for the Princess Aurora. I suppose this bothers me less than the fact that this beautiful maid has in recent years become a rather vulgarized product."
147,Sleeping Beauty,9,17 September 2010,Beautiful,"Sleeping Beauty is one of the few pre-60s products in which Walt Disney seems to be relinquishing some of his authorship to another figure. That man is art director Evyind Earle, who handles some of the most intricate and gorgeously composed backgrounds in all of animation, as daring in their placement of different colors with each other as in their grand scope.Unfortunately, Disney's great animators were less than thrilled with Earle's input, which they saw as undermining their own work, and they are correct in that this seems to be the least animation driven and most design driven of any Disney product outside of some of Ward Kimball's UPA-inspired shorts. Every frame looks like a tapestry, but the animation seemed a bit stifled behind the heavy details and many shades of color. This isn't a bad thing per se: Sleeping Beauty is one of Disney's better works.This is all in spite of the main characters. I've complained about the prince and princess characters in past Disney movies, but this is pushing it. Aurora's a vapid bimbo with pretty hair that replaces her brain. Prince Phillip, often complained about by his animator the great Milt Kahl for his extreme technical difficulty and personality-free demeanor, is a great achievement in terms of moving realistic forms around believably, but is also a violently boring individual who probably just wants to get with Aurora to prove he isn't a closet homosexual. As with so many other Disney movies, however, these flaws are largely made up for by one of the great villains in Maleficent, a milestone character in animator Marc Davis's career. Granted, it probably wasn't in Disney's best interest to adapt faithfully a story which features implied rape among other things, but it takes one of the greatest formal art jobs to make up for the shallow butchering that is this film's narrative.I'm making this all sound much worse than it is, however. For all this film's flaws, it is a great Disney film through and through, and a visual experiment fully on par with those of the Golden Age features. As with all of Disney's greatest works, there are sequences of the most remarkable beauty. Phillip's battle with Maleficent in dragon form (animated by Wolfgang Reitherman) is jaw dropping, and anytime Maleficent in either form shows up is bound to stick in the viewer's memory. Unfortunately, what it doesn't have that made Dumbo or Pinocchio or Bambi or even Lady and the Tramp great is an engrossing story. We enjoy the set-pieces and the visuals, and that's enough.Sadly, the film was big a bomb as other Disney experiments as Fantasia and Pinocchio, and Disney never really recovered this time. They resorted to cheaper and cheaper production methods following this film, and Walt Disney himself began steadily to lose interest in feature animation, instead turning his attention to his theme park.However, the first film to fall victim to these methods would actually wind up being all the better for them, and one of the finest films in the studio's history."
148,Sleeping Beauty,8,18 November 2008,Sleepy,"This is a good Disney movie but not as a good as the others such as ""Snow White"" or ""Beauty and the Beast."" It does have it's music that really define Disney movies although the music wasn't created by Disney or so I have read. The songs are magical and watching it before bed made me sleepy such is the movie title. Then my dreams were wished upon and I was dreaming like her. A lot of little girls like this movie and I liked it when I was little. The three fairies were cute too but if they didn't agree on the color of the dress then a total mess wouldn't have happened. The fairy making the cake should have picked the color. That part wasn't funny after 5000 times. Anyway, it's a pretty special and magical movie."
149,Sleeping Beauty,6,19 November 2007,I forgot about it until now,"When I was eight, six years ago, I loved this movie. I saw it a couple times before it re-released on VHS when I got it at Zellers. It had some good laughs. I forgot about Maleficent saying Hell, but I laughed when she said that. I also laughed when the two kings got drunk. That was classic. I liked at the end how the dress kept changing from pink to blue. If they make a sequel and a three-quell like with Cinderella, I swear I'll go nuts. I don't like it that much anymore, I'd watch it but it would be boring for me. I prefer Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, Stardust and Harry Potter now. I like it and all but not as much, it's from 1959 and all. The color is way better on the VHS now."
150,Sleeping Beauty,8,20 September 2005,Sleeping Beauty,"I saw this classic Disney animation many times during my childhood, based on the famous fairytale by the Brothers Grimm, but I knew I needed to see it again before seeing Angelina Jolie in Maleficent, the re-imagining of the same story with the villain at the centre, so I did. Basically King Stefan (Taylor Holmes) and Queen Leah (Verna Felton) after many years are happy to have been blessed with their first child, a daughter, they name her Aurora, a holiday is declared for her and the kingdom gather for her christening, the child is betrothed to young Prince Phillip, the son of King Hubert (Bill Thompson). Also attending the celebration are the three good fairies, Flora (Verna Felton), Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen) and Merryweather (Barbara Luddy), who with their magic bless her with gifts, Flora gives the gift of beauty, Fauna gives the gift of song, but before Merryweather can give her gift the evil Maleficent (Eleanor Audley) appears, upset by her refused invitation she curses the newborn princess. Maleficent proclaims that before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die, after she leaves however Merryweather alters this curse with her gift, she changes the fate to have Aurora not die, but to fall into deep sleep until she is awoken by true love's first kiss. The King orders all spinning wheels to be burned, but the fairies know it is not enough to prevent the curse, so after discussion they decide the princess will be safer growing up with them in a secluded woodcutter's cottage in the forest, they will live as mortals with her until the day of her sixteenth birthday. The years pass and Aurora (Mary Costa), renamed Briar Rose, has grown into a beautiful, sweet, gentle and kind young woman, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather plan to surprise her for her birthday with a dress and a cake, so they send her out to prepare the surprise party. Rose singing in the forest attracts the attention of the now handsome young man Prince Phillip (Bill Shirley) out riding his horse Samson, she talks to the woodland animals about wishing to fall in love, while singing they meet and instantly fall in love, unaware they are already betrothed, but she must return home, so tells him to meet her at the cottage later. The fairies meanwhile have made a mess of making a cake and a dress without magic, so they finally decide to use their wands, while Fauna makes the cake Flora and Merryweather argue about the dress colour being pink or blue, and their wand battle, and magic coming out of the chimney is spotted by Maleficent's raven Diablo. Rose returns home happy that she has fallen in love, the fairies, unaware it was Prince Phillip, explain she is Princess Aurora and is betrothed, with the raven listening, told never to see the young man she met again she leaves the room heartbroken, and Phillip meanwhile tells his father he has met a ""peasant girl"" who he wants to marry, ignoring the arranged marriage, Hubert fails to convince him otherwise and Phillip leaves to find her. Heartbroken Aurora is taken back to the kingdom, in the castle the fairies leave her a moment to sob, and Maleficent appears, putting the princess into a trance to follow her up the staircase to a room where a spinning wheel appears, and she is made to prick her finger on the spindle, fulfilling the curse. The fairies place the sleeping Aurora on a bed in the highest room of the tallest tower, and to avoid anyone finding out the fairies cast a spell to put all people in the kingdom into a deep sleep until the curse is broken and Rose is awakened, before falling asleep Hubert mentions Phillip meeting a ""peasant girl"", and realising the young man she mentioned was Phillip they race back to the cottage. Phillip is kidnapped by Maleficent's goon and taken to her lair in the Forbidden Mountains, following Maleficent to the dungeon the fairies overhear her explain to Phillip that the peasant girl is the princess, and that she plans to imprison him until he is an old man close to death to meet his sleeping love, who will not have aged a day, and she leaves delighted in his rage. The fairies release Phillip and arm him with a Shield of Virtue and Sword of Truth, after battling the minions and Merryweather turning raven Diablo into stone Maleficent discovers the prince escaping, she surrounds Stefan's castle with a forest of thorns, but this does not stop him, so Maleficent transforms into a gigantic fire-breathing dragon to battle him herself, but he defeats her, with the help of magic, throwing the sword into her heart, she falls to her death and her body disintegrates to ash. Phillip finds Princess Aurora and awakens her with true love's first kiss, the spell is broken and the people of the kingdom also wake up, the couple enter the palace ballroom, and after reuniting with the parents Phillip and Aurora dance, the argument of colours resumes between Flora and Merryweather, but Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip live happily ever after. Also starring Marvin Miller as the Narrator. The characters are definitely why the film works, the fairies adding both resource and comic relief, and of course horned Maleficent being the iconic self-proclaimed Mistress of All Evil, the film apparently took ten years to make and was not a big success on it's release, now it is seen as a great, with splendid animation techniques, charming storytelling and great music, including the most memorable song ""Once Upon a Dream"", I am really glad I watched again, a terrific animated fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for George Burns. Very good!"
151,Sleeping Beauty,6,13 January 2005,the Battle,"In the Final battle, Maleficent transforms herself into an evil, black, fire-breathing Dragon using the forces of Hell to kill Phillip. She drives him onto a cliff. there's no escape for the Prince now, for the Dragon has set the bottom on fire and if Phillip jumps, he'd get killed. To make it worse, Maleficent has knocked Phillip's shield out of his hand. It looks like Maleficent is going to win as she laughs a triumphant cackle, but Phillip, with the help of the fairies, throws the sword like a javelin right at the dragon's heart, which kills her. I hate the fact the dragon had to die. As a dragon, Maleficent kicks Ass"
152,Sleeping Beauty,10,5 July 2002,Princess Aurora Lives!!!!,"WOOOOOOOOOHHHEEEEEEEE!!!!! I'M JUST TELLING YOU ALL,THIS MOVIE IS TOP DOG!!!!! Sleeping Beauty/Princess Aurora/Briar Rose is the uttermost fantastic Heroine/Princess that Walt Disney has ever created!!! The story is TOTALLY classic and all the characters, except for the infamous Maleficent, are lovable and dear to see! For those of you who think that Walt Disney adaptions of fairy tales are fodder for satire or ridicule, GET OUT OF TOWN!!! You don't realize that you are putting down/slandering good, clean, entertaining AND, AND COMICAL ""Talking Pictures"". I tell you all the truth: Each and every one of Walt Disney's Animated Classics deserved and do deserve an Oscar for all of their effort and good quality-ESPECIALLY ONE THAT TELLS OF A PEASANT PRINCESS!!!"
153,Sleeping Beauty,10,11 December 1999,This is my favourite fairytale.,"This is my favourite Disney movie.  It may not look as good as The Little Mermaid, or the Lion King, but there is just something about it.  The story is so romantic, and Maleficent is the coolest Disney villain ever.  I love it when she says, ""You poor simple fools, thinking you could defeat me, ME, the mistress of all evil!  Well here's your precious princess.""  I used to have the record and the book that you read along with, and I wasn't quite old enough to read, but people thought I could 'cause I'd memorized the story!  This is an excellent movie for people like me who love happy endings."
