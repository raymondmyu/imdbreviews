0,Robots,9,25 January 2006,Tons Of Gags & A Good Message,"Animated movies are usually pretty good but nothing that great to me. However, this one is a ""keeper."" It gets high marks for all the jokes in here, lots of which are adult-style but not sleazy or filled with sexual innuendos, although there are a few of those, enough to make this PG, not G. However, the vast amount of clever lines is the main attraction here.Actually, the jokes come so hard and fast, it's hard to keep up with all of them. The visuals aren't gorgeous, as many modern-day animated films have become, but they are interesting. Not only is there a ton of gags to hear, but there are to see, too. You almost have to stop it frame-by-frame to see all the funny stuff penciled in the artwork.The story couldn't be simpler but it manages you keep your attention and doesn't overstay it's welcome, although I think animated films are more effective it they don't go over 80 minutes. This one is closer to 90.There is a good message in here, too. Maybe I'm mistaken but what I heard was the idea that just because people might be old, decaying and not as productive for society, it doesn't mean you have to discard them. Life has value and is precious from conception to dying of old age. Amen to that!"
1,Robots,,13 March 2005,Superb!  Classic Robin Williams!,"Sure, this is mostly a kids movie but as you have probably read many times, there is enough humor aimed at the adults to keep them entertained while with the kids. This is definitely good for all ages.Ewan McGregor stars as Rodney Copperbottom but it is clearly Robin Williams who steals the movie as Fender. He clearly overshadows McGregor, Halle Berry, Amanda Bynes, Mel Brooks, Greg Kinnear and all others involved. Of course, this is really about the animation. Everything about Robots is rendered exquisitely. The time and effort that must have went into making this movie is astonishing.I have read a few comments and reviews concerning Williams being annoying but that is absolutely 100% UNTRUE! I thoroughly enjoyed William's performance, which is saying something considering it is only his voice. Robot's marketing of William's character was not misleading. It is exactly as seen in the trailers. If you thought it was annoying, then why see it? Some people need to smarten up I suppose.Don't believe the haters here. Most only want to go against the grain. If you did not enjoy Williams' performance in the trailer, then please don't be disappointed when you see the same thing in the movie. I can honestly say that this is a great movie-going experience for everybody."
2,Robots,,7 December 2007,Planet of the Robots,"'Robots' is an entertaining animated film that is both funny and delightful. The animation is wonderful and has its own style. Even though it's not exactly of the Pixar quality, that actually works for the film especially with the motions. Colour has also been impressively used. The robot world is spectacular to watch. The designing is brilliant e.g. the train station and robot city.It includes a huge impressive ensemble of voice actors (sadly most of the cast is wasted) but not all the actors were efficiently used and many suffer due to poor character development. Ewan McGregor and Robin Williams have most of the lines and they do reasonably well.The film has a soul but the screenplay doesn't stick to the main plot. There are several plot holes and perhaps (as fun as they are) too many characters that lack development. In spite of its flaws, it's very much watchable, especially with the family. It is visually stunning and there are many funny moments, but there's surely something missing. You don't take anything away with you after the film's finished."
3,Robots,8,18 April 2006,*much* better than I was led to believe,"I don't think that (with the notable exception of one thread here on IMDb) this movie gets enough credit. The animation was darn good, and the humor had me laughing an awful lot. As a comedy this certainly hit the spot. I think if you enjoyed Ice Age, you could certainly find yourself enjoying this film as well.Sure, as some have pointed out the ""characters weren't really developed"" and ""there were a lot of characters involved"". *shrug* Who cares? I didn't sit down to watch this expecting to have a well-written Shakespeare play acted out before me. I sat down expecting to enjoy myself, laugh, and forget about the world around me (for the time being, at least). This movie gets a check in all three columns."
4,Robots,,5 March 2005,"Great animated film, adults will enjoy this one","I attended an advance screening for this film with my daughter and her friend (both 3). They enjoyed it, but I think older kids will be much more into it. There was also a lot of humor that will be appreciated by adults. I have seen all the computer animated films of recent years(Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Nemo, etc.) and I feel this one ranks up there with the best. This movie is visually stunning. The robot world created for this movie is unbelievable. There are some pinball like sequences that I found fascinating (Rube Goldbergesque for the older folks). This movie is quite funny. I am usually not a big Robin Williams fan, I find that he can be too in your face and distracting. That really was not the case in this film. The plot of Robots was good, but I did not walk out of the theater talking about the story lines. It was all about the visuals."
5,Robots,7,11 March 2005,"Technically Amazing, laugh-out-loud funny in other parts","Robots is probably the most technically amazing computer-animated movie I've ever seen. When you stack it up against a movie like the original Toy Story, it's astounding how far they've come in about 10 years. There is a scene were a drum of tiny ballbearings falls over, and each ballbearing is rendered perfectly. Amazing.The voice acting in Robots is just fine, with the ensemble cast providing a nice mix of auditory delights(although I saw Jim Broadbent's (the dad in Bridget Jones') name in the credits and was unable to identify him in the movie. Greg Kinnear did a fine job and Ewan MacGregor was also decent. The biggest question mark was Robin Williams. Before the movie I found myself wondering how he could top the 'Genie' performance in Aladdin. The answer is he doesn't, but his character is responsible for a few VERY funny bits and I think he pulled it off well.Now humor in the movie... It was clear to me that at least 80% of the adults in the audience weren't getting many of the references. If you are old enough/smart enough to catch these, they are hilarious. My favorite being when Rodney is repairing Bigweld's head and Bigweld is singing 'Daisy' very slowly. Priceless.All in all a great movie, and I also suspect this movie will improve with subsequent viewings. Where a Shark's Tale just becomes tiresome after one viewing, I am looking forward to viewing this movie again.Lastly, my 6 year-old son LOVED the movie. We saw it in IMAX and it completely blew him away."
6,Robots,8,12 October 2010,Good Animated Film!,"I'll admit that I did not want to see this. I thought the trailers were utter crap. I mean I saw too many robot movies when this first came out. I thought I would only stick with I, Robot, but I was forced to see this. I was pleasantly surprised how good this was, so I bought the DVD.This is about a robot named Rodney Coperbottom. He decides to go to the city to show off this invention to the famous Mr. Bigwald. Unfortunately, Bigwald is out of business and in order to get to him, he must face some evil corporate execs.This film featured a magnificent voice cast noticeably Robin Williams. I could recognize his voice in about anything, even in Happy Feet.The animation is good, nothing special. This is a good film to have the kids watch. I rate this film 8/10."
7,Robots,8,10 September 2009,Robots (Widescreen Edition),"""Robots"" comes to us from the creators of ""Ice Age"", but trust me- these are 2 very different movies. Rodney is a robot who's grown up in a middle class society. He's a bit rusty, his paint is chipped, his ""parts"" are hand-me-downs, and his father works as a dishwasher for a big-mouthed boss. I think that MANY people can relate to this situation, and in a subtle way, it's totally believable. Rodney is an inventor, and he dreams of making a better life for his family, and becoming something great. This is where his journey begins: on the road to bigger and better things. He finds himself in front of the Bigweld Corporation (to show his inventions), and of course because of his class- is denied entrance. An arrogant robot named Ratchet is trying to take over the company (with help from his retchid mother, Madame Gasket, who plans on turning all lower robots into scrap metal), and nobody seems to know where Bigweld is. With help from his new friends along the way (Fender -voiced by Robin Williams, Piper, Crank, Diesel, Lug, Cappy, Wonderbot, and Aunt Fanny)- it seems that no matter the obstacle, Rodney's life is about to change for the better. His plan: to find Bigweld, and stop Ratchet from destroying all the lower class robots. The visual effects in this movie are astounding! It's clearly a remarkable feast for the eyes. The cities are creative, as are the characters. There is mild , suggestive humor, but nothing terribly offensive. Robin Williams and Jennifer Coolidge (Aunt Fanny) are hilarious in their own right. There are MANY bonus features, including a behind the scenes, interviews with the voice-over actors, and even some games that you can sort through using your DVD player's controller. All in all, you get your money's worth with this movie, and it's enjoyable for the whole family!"
8,Robots,8,5 November 2005,Brilliant but not a patch on giants such as Finding Nemo and The Incredibles,"Robots- This film is pure excellence right from the beginning to the fascinating finale, this animation sees Robin Williams at his best. I find that the beginning of Robots drags on a bit, but when he catches the train to Robot City that's where the fun really begins. The scene where Robin Williams character is on the slide thing is one of the best scenes in the movie. My favourite character has to be Fender (I think that's his name)- the one that's always losing his parts. My favourite scene is towards the end when all the good robots are fighting the evil, upgraded robots and Fender is dressed in up like a school girl and belts out Britney Spears number 1 hit 'Hit Me Baby One More Time' while he's bashing the upgraded robots on the head. 8/10 brilliant but not a patch on Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc or The Incredibles."
9,Robots,7,14 March 2005,Stupendous visuals only barely make up for a forgettable story and characters,"The first 2005 film I've seen, and, really, it's the only one released so far this year that I have had even the littlest desire to see at the theater. It was worth seeing, but it's forgettable. The visuals are absolutely eye-popping. The film's best sequence is a Rube Goldberg-esque public transportation system across town. I think if that had gone on for 90 minutes, we would have had some kind of masterpiece on our hands. Instead, we get a dull story of a group of nearly outmoded robots rebelling against an evil company that is no longer building spare parts. The head of that company used to be all for the common folk, but he's disappeared and left a despot in his place. The underground area, where they melt scrap, is really cool, and reminded me of The Nightmare Before Christmas. Madame Gasket, who rules this part of the city, was the most interestingly designed character. Robin Williams is very annoying, but, to his credit, he is playing a character here, not just himself. I wasn't thinking ""Man, is Robin Williams annoying,"" but rather, ""Man, that character Robin Williams is playing is annoying."" I doubt that could be taken as much of a compliment, though. All of the other main characters are especially forgettable, especially Halle Berry's character, who is supposedly the female lead. I think most of the audiences wanted the protagonist to end up with the second female lead, who is a tad more interesting. And I think the filmmakers realized this, too, because the hero only barely ends up with Berry at the end. The movie is also in need of laughs. I chuckled a bit, but that was all. The funniest moment is the robot who does the robot dance. As much as I can complain, though, I would still highly recommend (renting) it for the visuals alone."
10,Robots,6,5 April 2005,Not a lot of feeling,"I'm an animator and I can appreciate the work that went into this film. Its visually interesting, but at the same time cluttered. So from a technical stand point it had its pros. Overall the story was mildly interesting. It started out really slow and I wasn't sure whether I would be able to get through the whole movie. But it did pick up a little bit as the movie went on. Now for the major negative points. There are too many characters. The supporting cast is numerous and uninteresting. It comes off as if the art department designed a bunch of robots first then decided they didn't want to give up any of the designs.The characters personalities are kind of flat. Even the main characters don't really invoke an emotional connection. The secondary characters are just robots that happen to talk once and a while.I don't know what is with the trend to put in popular music into animated pictures but it just seems so off when you are watching in. When the story is progressing and then a bunch of characters break out into a dance routine set to a Britney Spears song its like someone suddenly turned on another TV in the room. And this kind of thing happens numerous times. Its even noticeable in the fight sequences and some others which appear to be designed to show funky and interesting animation rather than advance or even fit into the story. Bottom line, Blue Sky Studios did a much better job on Ice Age. Just like PDI did a much better job on Shrek compared to Shark's Tale (Which was garbage). They just need to get some people involved who can trim the fat of the story and keep people who think they are directing a music video out of the editing room."
11,Robots,,13 March 2005,Incredibly Clever.  Robin Williams Is Truly Gifted.,"From the previews, I expected this to be just another animated movie to cash in on the success of other computer animated movies like Shrek, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., etc. In a way, I guess it is, but it is MUCH better than I would have thought from just the previews. This is a good example of a film that did not give away most of the best parts in a short trailer.Robots is a pretty simple story about a young, naive robot named Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) who ventures into the big ""Robot City"" to find success as an inventor and make a better life for himself and his parents. He seeks out his hero, Mr. Bigweld (Mel Brooks), who promises to personally check out each invention. Rodney finds that Bigweld is nowhere to be found and the company has been taken over by the evil robot, Ratchet (Greg Kinnear). Rodney and a crew of misfit robots, led by Fender (Robin Williams), who he met when first arriving in Robot City, take it upon themselves to figure out the mystery of Bigweld's disappearance and to expose the evil Ratchet to the public.Again, the story is simple, if anything, so the kids can enjoy it but as you hear quite a bit with this new breed of animation movies, there is enough humor for the average adult to enjoy as well. However, like Finding Nemo, the real treat with this movie is the animation itself. The beautiful sceneries and the slick new robots are awesome and pretty original. Even the old, rusty robots are nice to look at. Also, as most probably expected or have probably even read already, Robin Williams takes this movie up a notch. That man is incredibly gifted when it comes to entertaining. This movie is surprisingly good. 9/10"
12,Robots,,14 March 2005,Was there a story here?,"I left this film feeling high. Not because I literally ingested anything before arriving at the theatre, but because the movie provided that familiar feeling of one's brain being reduced to a muddled receptor for bright colors and funny noises.So about the story: boy robot leaves his home for the big-city, must defeat evil robot trying to control the robot world. During this epic quest he encounters a series of Disney-ish archetypes, including: wacky robot sidekick (voiced by Robin Williams, natch), bland robot love interest (Halle Berry, spending all of maybe three hours in the recording studio), and a spunky tomboy robot (voiced by some unmemorable tween star).The storyline, such as it is, could probably fill a single half-hour slot on Nickelodeon. There are a few funny bits of dialogue (provided by off-Broadway scribe David Lindsay Abaire), but mostly the script is just the filler before the next elaborate visual sequence dreamed up by the animators.And don't get me wrong: those visual sequences are pretty cool. I can't quite decide which is more impressive: the hyperkinetic ride through the immaculately detailed robot city or a complicated sequence involving thousands of dominoes. The art department clearly put a mind-boggling amount of effort into creating a fully realized world.But that, unfortunately, is all there is. An awesomely rendered environment with nothing in the foreground. Many of the characters, particularly the protagonist, feel like little more than rough outlines. The relationships between characters feel like tacked-on afterthoughts. This is compounded by the most lackluster and non-distinctive voice work I've ever heard from major movie stars (Ewan McGregor and Halle Berry sound so bored, I would have preferred they hire interns from the accounting department).I recommend this film slightly, simply because of the stunning visuals. But otherwise, with the success of truly subversive CGI films like The Incredibles and Shrek, Robots just doesn't cut it."
13,Robots,8,21 June 2009,well done animation for everyone,"I enjoyed the movie a lot, especially the first half. May be I was attracted by all the machines moving around. There were very nicely designed contraptions. Also there were some very good jokes. The best ones from my point of view were, after they assemble the baby, the mother says: ""12 hours of labor"". Right after the dad says: ""He has got your mums eyes and my dads nose. I knew it was smart to save those parts"". The story was enjoyable but the end was a bit childish so to say. But the whole idea of a robot society that has human habits is brilliant. If you are looking for a movie that the whole family can enjoy, this movie is definitely for you."
14,Robots,7,17 September 2008,"Fun, exciting and very funny.","For me, the thing that pretty much makes this CGI film is Robin Williams voicing a robot called Fender and Wonderbot. These two characters engaged me the whole way, as they are funny, (in the case of Fender), cute (in the case of Wonderbot) and interesting. The rest of the film is perfectly all right, in between brilliant and mediocre. The animation, for me, is probably the third best part of the film, especially the CGI backgrounds with the immense detail. Of course, I liked everything else about this film, apart from the fact that there was quite a deal of evil in this film and some parts of the film are a little bit cliché.In this film set in a robot world with robot characters, a young robot called Rodney Copperbottom stars as the main character and he wants to be an inventor, so he can show his invention/s to a famous robot called Bigweld, who appears on the TV. When Rodney is old enough to go to Robot City to show Bigweld his invention, he sets off, with his invention, Wonderbot. Rodney finds pleasant and unpleasant surprises in Robot City and an adventure begins...Overall, this is worth a watch for children aged around 7 and above and for anyone else who enjoys good animated films. Enjoy ""Robots""! :-)7 and a half out of ten."
15,Robots,7,1 September 2007,Original and visually stunning!,"Yesterday I was shopping at Target and they had a bunch of movies for seven fifty, Robots was one of them. I never saw the movie before, but I figured it's just a couple more bucks then if I rented it, so I bought it and watched it last night. I have to say that I'm glad I bought it because I really enjoyed it, this was a fun animated movie that got over looked in 2005. It had great actors for the voices, Mel Brooks couldn't have been a more perfect choice, the whole look of the movie is absolutely cool to look at, and the story was extremely original. This is a great film to watch for yourself or with the family.Rodney is a common robot with his poor parents, but he has big city dreams to meet Bigweld, the biggest robot of all time, he is the inventor who makes sure that every robot is taken care of. Rodney goes to the big city to meet Bigweld and become an inventor himself, but ends up meeting several robots who are nobody's including Fender, his new best friend. They discover that an evil robot who has taken over Bigweld's factory is planning on destroying all the old bots who can't afford to upgrade, so pretty much that's the whole town. But Rodney and his friends are dedicated to making sure that everyone can be safe as an old bot.Robots is a very imaginative movie with a very creative story and look. I was really impressed with this movie and would highly recommend it. It has very funny moments for both the kids and the adults, so it works for a family movie very well. Robin Williams did a terrific job as Vender, he was just a great addition and brought fun comedic relief. But the whole cast sounded like they had a lot of fun with this movie. This is a fun film to watch and I think anyone could enjoy it, so grab the popcorn, because you're gonna have fun.7/10"
16,Robots,8,23 December 2006,"Fun filled, exciting and memorable film for all the family!","I went to see this with a friend at the cinema. I'd seen no trailers and wasn't really expecting anything special, but i came out of the cinema a couple of hours later, with a great big smile and my face and a fulfilled feeling inside. Robots is one of the most feel good films you can see! Every character had been thought about carefully, and each personality shines through throughout the film. The great choice of voice-overs really makes the film special. I was really impressed at how lifelike they made the range of characters look, while still keeping with the theme of the weird and wonderful robot world. We follow Rodney Copperbottom, the root whos grown up, dreaming of being an inventor. He comes from a less-fortunate family, but with the wonderful words of Bigweld (the greatest inventor in the world) - 'you cans shine no matter what you're made of' in his heart he fights for his dream, like all good robots should ;) The story keeps going at a good pace, i never felt it was rushed or dragging on. The music in the film, especially for the 'washing up' scene is used really well, and really makes you feel the emotions of the movie. I rented out this DVD as soon as it was available and soon after i brought it for myself. I've watching it with 4 generations of people now and everyones really enjoyed the film. Id recommend it to anyone who likes a feel good, fun, well created, emotional, funny, clever and heart warming film. So i guess thats all of you? Enjoy!"
17,Robots,7,27 September 2006,Certainly good  it just lacks that little something 'extra',"While Disney and its child Pixar Studios focus on family morals and heartfelt messages in their films (Finding Nemo) and Dreamworks focus on meticulous animation (Shrek I & II), Blue Skye Studios (Ice Age) shifts their focus onto humor  big doses of humor. There is a kind of rewarding simplicity in an approach like that, and it translates well in its animated features, Ice Age most of all. In their most recent installment Robots (2005), some of the humour is lost and instead replaced by wide-ranging gallery of big shot actors like Mel Brooks, Robin Williams, Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent and Drew Carey to name a few. The result is a good, albeit forgettable film.We follow Rodney Copperbottom (voiced by Ewan McGregor)  a young, idealist robot  who migrates to big Robot City in hopes to become an inventor to save his father from getting scrapped. When he reaches the city, he is met by a new management of the manufacture company in town that has stopped making spare parts, focusing on costly ""upgrades"", relegating the average bot like Rodney's father to reduced scrap at the chop-factory. Rodney decides to help.Plot outline aside, it is clear from the detailed setting of the film that Blue Skye has done something really cool here  they have created a mechanical world solely of robots and suffice to say that it sucks you in. It indulges in the meticulous mechanism that this world offers  such as Robots doing the Robot-dance (one of the most strikingly hilarious moments in the film), all the while commenting on the materialism of our own world through the manufacture factory device. It's about consumerism and companies constantly on the edge, pushing for new material concept and leaving 'dated' material behind, thereby pinning the people (or robots) somewhere in between and wondering in which direction to go.What else is commendable is that Robots rarely suffers the pitfalls of sentimental cheese á la Disney/Pixar studios when the characters have their heartfelt moments. There are in fact very few of these because the film is simply too busy navigating the fun world of robots, swooping fast-paced down to extreme technological devices and chase-scenes such as the roller-coaster ride that takes Rodney to Robot City. It's having fun, and it makes no pretense about it. The animation greatly distinguishes itself from Dreamworks where it's fluent, sleek and beautiful (Shrek I & II)  here it is rusty, awkward and mechanical and it all fits perfectly.However, what it most enjoyable about the film is not its environment or animation, but its surprising number of GOOD sing-and-dance numbers. Who would have thought that Robin Williams (whose comedic presence comes through his character) spoofing a Britney Spears song could be so funny? Other than Britney, the film is evenly peppered with pop-cultures references. The beloved dodo bird from Ice Age gets a blatant homage at one point. Star Wars: Attack of the Clones at another point, when Fender (Robin Williams) does his best C-3PO impression at a hellish chop-factory similar to the one in the Star Wars movie (""Machines making machines.""). In this way, there is certainly a lot that adults can enjoy and laugh at, leaving the fart jokes for the kids.I am pressed to find something that I DIDN'T like about the film. Ultimately, it just does not come close to the comedic brilliance of Ice Age. It lacks the heart of Disney. It lacks the beautiful animation of Dreamworks. So the very things that made it a good film in the first place also makes it forgettable.7 out of 10"
18,Robots,8,15 August 2006,Gets through quality control,"The novelty of animated films may have worn off since the revolutionary days of the Lion King, but I'd be lion if I said this wasn't one of the better ones to have come out of the animated scene in recent times. After learning the ropes with Ice Age, Wedge takes animation a step further - creating a movie with a real adults themes and motifs and yet still enough slapstick comedy to amuse younger generations.The main theme  ""Follow Your Dreams"" - is played out by Rodney (Ewan McGregor) a humble, small-town Robot who moves to the big city to find his fortune. He is joined by motor-mouthed sidekick Fender (Robin Williams) who's mishaps and mistakes combine with gags such as the robots dismantling themselves to pass through the metal detector to give the film it's light-hearted and amusing side.Such a big-name cast can hardly fail to make an impression, though it must be said that some, like Halle Berry, must feel like spare parts. That minor criticism aside, the action is almost flawless  here is definitely a film that gets through quality control."
19,Robots,,13 March 2005,Top Notch Animation!  Better Than Expected!,"Robots is a beautifully computer animated movie about... Robots. Basically, the main robot in the story, Rodney (voiced by Ewan McGregor), decides to go to the big city to meet up with his childhood hero, Bigweld (voiced by Mel Brooks), and to get his invention out to the other robots. His invention is basically another robot but this is pretty much a fairy tale anyways, right? Rodney runs into Fender (voiced by Robin Williams) upon his arrival in the big Robot City when Fender tries to take advantage of Rodney and soon after, tries to steal his foot! I guess that is the robot equivalent of stealing shoes by the thieves here in the real world. Little things like that made the movie a unique experience. You can tell that a lot of thought went into the little parts, like the ""making the baby"" scene at the beginning. I thought that was ingenious, especially for a kids movie and still keeping it clean. The best looking robots were the sharp looking corporate robots. Ratchet (voiced by Greg Kinnear) was the main villain here and Cappy (voiced by Halle Berry) was the female corporate robot on the side of good, eventually helping Rodney in his quest.If I had any real complaints (which I don't, I'm really just nitpicking), the storyline could have been a tad deeper and for whatever they paid Halle Berry, it was not worth it. Her voice was not distinctive enough and if her name was not all over it, nobody would have noticed. Same with McGregor, too, I guess. They could have found voice actors for far less, but for these movies, money is obviously no object. I highly recommend if you liked the animation of Shrek or Ice Age. I give 9.5 stars of the available 10."
20,Robots,4,13 March 2005,Robot City: Impressive to look at... not so much to live in...,"""Robots"" is the latest computer animated feature film from the creators of Ice Age. Like many films of the same genre, ""Robots"" offers a new artistic style and a large cast of voice talents, all of which would make pretty entertaining guests on any episode of Saturday Night Live... However ""Robots"" is more of a sight to see than a movie-going experience to fully enjoy.Rodney (Ewen McGregor, Big Fish)is a robot born (or built rather) to become an inventor. Just like his idol Big Weld (Mel Brooks) encourages, Rodney believes anyone can shine no matter what you're made of. This credo is put to the ultimate test when Rodney leaves home to Robot City in hopes to get employed in Big Weld's big corporation as an inventor. Rodney learns the hard way how tough Robot City can be for the average robot... especially under new management where management entails getting rid of outdated robots and reducing them to scrap metal. With the help of a rusty robot crew including Robin Williams and Amanda Bynes, Rodney will go on an adventure to turn Robot City into the dream he's always imagined it to be.As you can tell, ""Robots"" is a movie with heart, what do you expect for a movie targeted for a family audience. It also had some funny moments, and, as expected, were mostly contributed to Robin's robot character. There were also little details that achieved good laughs... Robot City wouldn't be complete without a robot doing the robot. Again the art in ""Robots"" also deserves credit using darker color schemes which allowed for a better feel for the robot world. The design of the city was also impressive: intricate modes of transportation, the ability to carry a conversation with a traffic light, and a walking mailbox that knows you by name...However its kind of like a new President addressing the United States... he may look nice, brand new suit with hair combed nicely, and he may have a good message. But the message is only as good as its delivery. This is probably a bad analogy, but if ""Robots"" and ""Monsters, Inc"" ran for president it would be a landslide victory for the Pixar party.I compare the two movies with good reason. Both movies offer completely new worlds: a robot world and a monster world. Both movies feature major cities that rely its existence heavily on the production of a major corporation, Big Weld for Robot City and Monsters, Inc. for Monstropolis. There's just one major difference: Monstropolis makes sense and Robot City doesn't.You might wonder why should it make sense, it's fake? Any Joe Schmoe from the street tripping on acid can make a movie about some make-believe world, but its an even heavier task to make a world where things not only make sense, but are also necessary for the world to be plausible. Monstropolis works: both the city itself as well as the things that went on in the made up city. With Robot City there are too many questions: Why?! How?! What the hell was that for?! Who?! I refer my Who question to Halle Berry's character who is top-billed and forced to be integral to the plot, yet only has about 4-5 lines throughout the whole movie.I give it a 4 out of 10 because I'm midway with this movie. It looked cool but it wasn't. Like a beautiful girl with no personality. It can be really funny, but other times it tries a bit hard. What Robots lacked was ironically originality. Even Robin Williams' character was a bit reminiscent of the Genie from Aladdin without the comedic usefulness of shapeshifting. It was a good attempt, but ultimately ""Robots"" is sadly recycled scrap metal."
21,Robots,8,19 November 2006,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I was expecting Robots to suck b/c in the trailers there were several ""red flags"" 1.) Trailers never explained story 2.) All-star cast...Usually indicating no one invested in the plot or hired actors with REAL vocal talent, they just wanted big names to attract people...""Shark Tale"" is a perfect example of this.3.) It was ""Dreamworks"" thus I was expecting fart joke after pop-culture pun every 2 minutes...(Again see ""Shark Tale"" or better ""Shrek"") 4.) Robin Willaims-I like the guy as an actor, I'm not knocking his methods but lately he just turns into one huge ham on crack when he voices cartoons...He thinks he's stealing scenes when he just makes the cartoon irritating.But I rented this last year & was surprised at how much I enjoyed! I watched it over & over again...The story is very cute! Rodney is a suburban Robot (in a universe where there are NO organic creatures just machines) who dreams of being a big time inventor in Robot City...He finds that a corporate villain is out to melt down ALL Robots who cannot afford to get ""up-graded"" to look like a sleek chrome android.The story isn't that original, but frankly neither are MOST CGI flicks...Also ""The Incredibles"" had better voice-acting...Mel Brooks(Big Weld) Craig Kilborn (Ratchett) Jennifer Coolidge(Aunt Fan) & Amanda Bynes(Piper) were the best voices...Everyone else was okay and Halle Berry (Cappy) was absolutely bland.You can tell Dreamworks only hired her for bragging rights...So bland that you'd wish Rodney would fall in love with Piper instead...But I guess Piper was too young for him & that wouldn't be right.Also the animation is amazing...The characters look like live-action toys & each Robot has a quirky intricate design...It almost looks like it was animated by someone with Obsessive-compulsive disorder.Anyway I'd recommend this movie....It's better than most of Dreamworks CGI.And there are a few fart jokes (not in excess though) & I actually thought Robin Willaims was tolerable...He didn't make the movie great but he didn't bring it down either.So yeah if it's on TV or you wanna rent it, give it a chance."
22,Robots,,25 March 2005,Lackluster and forgettable,"Movie lovers who appreciate computer animated films find that only about half are worthwhile. Things that make any film good are as applicable to animated (computer or traditional) movies as they are to live action. These include having a compelling story, a good script, good performances and good visuals.Having said this, there is a reason why the Pixar animated features have been consistently excellent and memorable. The reason is that they work very hard at refining each and every one of these elements until they have achieved excellence across the board. I understand that they routinely work plot and script for a couple of years before starting the animation. Once animation starts, they work the fine details that make for great animation. They know, and use, all of the old tricks, then invent new ones too.Now, what is right with a movie like Robots? Well, is has a good concept. What is wrong with Robots? Just about everything else.The film makers have taken a cute idea and almost totally failed to make it interesting at either the story or script level. Then, they have done a decent but largely uninspired job at the actual animation. People who know what to look for will see lots of fairly basic things, learned back with the better Disney and Warner Brothers animated films, that were apparently forgotten by the makers of Robots. Yes, there are a few nice touches, like the Rube Goldberg transportation system, but this does not carry the movie and is actually not very well animated. One glaring thing I noticed is that when characters or objects move fast, they disappear. This is because the rate of movement is too fast given the frame rate of the animation. Disney and Chuck Jones (et al) and Pixar have learned tricks to compensate for this. Not so the makers of Robots.The next thing that many will notice is that Robots (like Shark Tale) is sold primarily on the strength of the voice talent, all actors who have been in lots of things recently and will appeal, on name recognition alone, to viewers. Ever notice that most voices in Pixar films are done by people you never heard about, or even by the animators themselves, or their family members? Even Robin Williams cannot make a single word of Robots interesting or entertaining.I sort of enjoyed Robots, but before I had walked out of the theater door I had forgotten half of what was in the movie, and had no desire to recommend it to anyone else, or to buy a DVD.Not a good kid's movie, and not a good adult movie. Just a piece of forgettable fluff."
23,Robots,10,30 August 2005,"Very enjoyable, charismatic, ideological, and humorous","I was fascinated very much with the Robots movie. Despite that I hadn't seen an animated movie in quite some time, this movie took be back to the childhood days of passionate, diligent, and intriguing watching of a movie which was entertaining as well as inspiring. The theme of big business and personal aspirations of success and justice were there, but also were the characters which made the struggle and the journey fun just by the humor on such subjects as companionship, competition, social interface, and confidential rapport. The family support and friendship emphasis more than enhanced the theme to value the consumer and bring back honesty and integrity to the marketplace of products and salesmanship. However, also I enjoyed the fun-moments during all the diverse ways of achieving honor and respectful ways of doing things, which satirized humorously certain aspects of life we enjoy but are not sure how to fully partake in such as meetings, social functions, holidays, conquest, discussing issues, and consulting allies. So therefore, if politics, economics, corporate control, social networking, and entertainment among friends, family and colleagues seems complex and overwhelming, for a little bit of amusement and relief, watch the movie, because the issues will linger on, but you can get as much enjoyment in them as you wish by paying attention to the keen way these aspects of life are displayed."
24,Robots,7,6 July 2010,An Enjoyable film,"OK so first thing's first, this movie is forgettable. The only time I remember this movie is when I run across it like I did here on IMDb.With that said, even though it is forgettable, it was a good movie. I remember going to see it in theaters with my cousin. We both enjoyed it. Now I was about 11 or 12 years old when we saw it the first time but since then I have rewatched it. I thought it was a solid film that kept me entertained. In fact I recommend that you see this film if you haven't already. The reason I recommend the film is because it is so different from other animated films if i do say so myself. The art style, the music, the story, it was all original.So yeah, it was a cool movie. I don't recall any negative things (besides that it moves really slow in a few parts of the film)."
25,Robots,10,18 May 2010,Fun for  ages,"This is a great movie for all ages! There are funny parts for parents and kids! One of the best animated comedies I have seen in a long time. This movie has a great inspirational plot and teaches you to never give up! ""Robots"" is full of vibrant colors and outstanding detail and will keep you entertained through the entire movie! ""Robots"" is a roller-coaster of fun; mostly a comedy but yet has a few serious parts but still a very easy movie to follow. If you are trying to find a movie for the family to watch and haven't seen Robots yet, this should definitely be the movie you watch! A family must see! Two thumbs up and an absolute 10 out of 10!"
26,Robots,9,18 July 2006,The message makes the movie,"Of all computer-animated movies (except possibility Tron) this is my favorite. Like most others, it is pretty, with a simple, child-friendly plot, some action, and cheesy dialog. But ""Robots"" shines like no other on one point: the message it delivers. It all comes down to the message ""you can do it"". I'll try to break it down to sub-messages:You can shine no matter what you're made of. This is a blow at the horrible ""remake"" trend. You are just fine the way you are!Be persistent, try again, don't give up your dreams!The expectations and encouragement of our parents is the key to the persistentness.and the list is completed byTechnology is fun! Creativeness is fun!Even the problem of making good young heroes is perfectly made. The youth of Rodney doesn't require the old-timers to be idiots (like in some low-quality scripts), young and old need each other.All this is well packaged in a way that makes sense. The robot world resembles the monster world in ""Monsters Inc"", but with the added logic of mechanical creatures who can replace parts of themselves as they like.Speaking of technology, in many media I often perceive messages that math and technology are boring and tedious. Even Sudoku is defensively presented as ""not math"". In this movie, technology, physics and mechanics in particular, are good and fun things. Experiment! Invent! That's what I like my kinds to hear, not that learning is hard and best avoided.The music is very amusing, from Tom Waite's ""Underground"" to James Brown's ""Get up offa that thing"" in the fun ending.On the negative side, the ending fight is cheesy and boring, but I know, the kids don't agree with me. Anyway, I do *not* like the idea that a bad guy should be melted down in an oven. That is cheap revengeful blood-thirst, that shouldn't have been in a fine movie like this.It disturbs me a little bit that the female characters are (as so often) fewer than the male ones, but at least we get two strong and resourceful women plus a female bad guy, so it doesn't fail completely.So it loses a point for the fight, but otherwise, this is the best computer animated movie, even better than Pixar's, and a lot better than the tedious and hollow ""Ice Age"" movies. If you care about what messages your kids get from movies, this is the movie to show them!"
27,Robots,10,8 July 2006,Utterly brilliant,"ROBOTS was built for the 3D IMAX and should not be experienced on anything less than a 3D IMAX. Before release, it was hyped up as the most advanced and best computer animated film ever and guess what? That actually turned out to be true. At first I was quite apprehensive about watching this movie but it turned out to be utterly brilliant and completely unexpected. The animation, the artistic expression, the physics of the robot world are all brilliant as is the story, music, songs, acting and just about everything else. The dialog is quite suggestive and may not be quite suitable for younger audiences. I can't believe how underrated this movie is."
28,Robots,8,17 April 2006,Very funny and memorable,"It is, without a doubt, one of the best animation flicks I have seen lately, and is well-written as well as being one of the few movies I enjoy that is PG.Unlike many people, I find Robin Williams to have been a great addition, and I think that the crazy personality he naturally has is perfect for animation roles like this. This movie is also perfect for those who are often watching movies with children, but who also want to laugh, or in most cases, giggle at obscure hidden ties to other, more adult things, like the ""fun"" in making a baby, or other little pieces of adult comedy, however as hidden and politically corrected as it has been made.My only problem with the movie is that I would have loved to see more of Robot City, and more of the robots in general"
29,Robots,1,9 April 2005,beautiful art wasted on a paint by the numbers story written by the marketing department,"Thankfuly, I got hold of a screener of this film. Even for free in the comfort of our living room, my 9 year old daughter said she wasn't interested in seeing it after her friends in school told her it was the stupidest ""cartoon movie"" they'd seen. Bored and stuck in the house the other day, we sat and watched it. Her friends were right. It looked and sounded beautiful. My compliments and praise to the artists and tech people that put it together. BUT... the story was insulting to my intelligence and sensibilities and to my 9 year old daughter's. The team of marketing morons that stood in for writers need to understand that empty pop culture references and fart jokes (yes, robot fart jokes) can not substitute for a well written (or even half-assed written) piece of dialog. Children are young and can be easily impressed... but that does not mean they are retarded. I did not think I would see a studio put out a more insultingly bad and devoid of heart children's animated film than SHARK TALE, but I was wrong. And someone please shut Robin Williams up. There are times he hits the mark... this was not one of them. Rapid fire impressions and pop culture references can be funny... but just spouting references and impressions for the sake of doing it doesn't make it funny. His act has become a sad joke."
30,Robots,9,30 September 2005,Chase Your Dreams to Make Them Come True,"In a world of robots, the young Rodney decides to move to the metropolis of Robot City, to meet the powerful inventor and his idol Bigweld, trying to get a position in his corporation. However, the new president Ratchet manages the company for profit with new parts only, leaving the old robots fated to become scrap in the mill of Ratchet's mother. Rodney, with the support of his old robots friends, convinces Bigweld to fight for his position back.""Robots"" is a funny and very creative adventure with many good messages. The first one certainly is that everybody must chase the dreams to make them come true. There is a great criticism to the power and ambition of great corporations, oriented to huge profits without giving any importance to the majority of consumers. The revolutionary power of ordinary people together, fighting for their rights, is also explicitly showed in this animation. There are many funny situations in this great entertainment for the whole family. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Robôs"" (""Robots"")"
31,Robots,7,30 December 2008,Beatuful Animation,"Fox Animation is a poor cousin to Pixar and Dreamworks which dominate the American and European market. Robots however is a good children's film, better then the Ice Age franchise which Fox keeps trying to push.The plot of Robots is focused on Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor), who has ambitions to become an inventor. He leaves his small town to live in Robot City. He wants for Bigweld (Mel Brooks), a major industrialist who put the people i.e. common robots first. However when Rodney arrives in the city he finds that all is not well, with the evil Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) wanting to stop making spare parts for older robots, and forcing them to get upgrades.The plot of Robots is clichéd and could be written on the back of a fag packet. They is the normal messages such as follow your dreams, it doesn't matter what you look like on the outside, a pseudo-Nazism from the villains and an anti-big business message (which is ironic considering Fox is a massive company). Adults can pick through the plot, but children won't mind. What makes this film work is the visual effects. They were top-notch and Robots wasn't a cheap cash-in. They were lovely designs, of both the robots and the environment, with Robot City reminding me of Metropolis. As well, the film also remembered me a little of Shrek 2 when they arrived in Far Far Away. They are good visual and verbal gags, with pop-culture reference which will make you smile. However, with some of the gags during the final fight scene weren't needed. There are also a couple of sex jokes which parents may not agree with. I personally thought Greg Kinnear was the best performance in the film and has some of the best lines. Ewan McGregor offered a perfect American accent, whilst Mel Brooks was perfectly casted as Bigweld. Amanda Byres was decent as a teenage robots, but Robin Williams was a bit over the top for my liking and Halle Berry may as well not bother to show up and any woman could have done her role.7.5 out of 10."
32,Robots,8,6 December 2006,great movie for all ages.,"My son and nephew (3yr and 2yr respectively) LOVE this movie. I greatly enjoy it. I find it very imaginative. Granted it can be hokey at times but what cartoon movie isn't. There is humor for all ages, which I think makes for a good movie. It is obvious to me the creators and writers put a lot of thought into the production. When you watch the movie you can actually picture real characters and people in the parts. It includes the subtle things like ""cigars"", drinking hot grease in the morning, and going to a restaurant. And what movie isn't destined for greatness with Robin Williams being one of the characters. All in all I find this movie is a great movie for the family and a must see for all children."
33,Robots,8,20 November 2005,Near Perfect - Jokes Too Infrequent,"I really liked this movie a lot. At first it struck me as no different from a cute family story which will be merely entertaining. Well, that was over after a certain point when some of the better jokes came along. I started to laugh out loud. Then I knew this was a good movie.I no longer think Robin Williams' stand-up is funny - not for a long time. But when he falls into roles in movies like these, then his comedy comes full force and you see the once great comedian come to life (albeit through the character).The computer animation is much better than Ice Age b/c there is so much authentic looking detail.A bit slow in the beginning that finally gets going with the humor that was, after that, all too infrequent. Highly watchable again. 8/10.-Zafoid"
34,Robots,,15 March 2005,Voice Actors...,"I actually picked up Halle Berry's voice right away, having not been previously informed she was in the flick. I found McGregor's voice obvious as well, but knew he was slated as the lead. As for Kinnear, I couldn't figure out his voice for the life of me! Though I tried to put the voice to a name. And I didn't know Mel Brooks was Bigweld until the credits rolled. As for the whole thing about voice actors toning the price tag down, I don't know about that. Animations are fun to do for actors. I would presume. And who goes to animations because they like an actor's voice? You go because it looks awesome. This movie delivers in that respect. Furthermore, I don't think ""big name actors"" stole the show in this one. The voices seemed more about the characters than, perhaps, being constantly reminded that Ellen DeGeneres was the forgetful fish in that other animated film...The animation is top notch."
35,Robots,,12 March 2005,Disappointing,"My five year old son and I had been waiting to see this movie for weeks. The trailers looked promising. We went today, and I was so disappointed. Even worse, my five year old, who loves movies and recites lines endlessly, didn't really like it. ""It was just okay"", he said afterward. The film starts out alright, and it's visually beautiful, but it declines into one gag after another. It was kind of like a kiddie/robot SNL show with a very slim story line holding the skits together. And Robin Williams, who can be so brilliant in this type of role, was just annoying. It was sad really. The movie held such promise. When will Hollywood learn that the story matters?"
36,Robots,2,16 March 2005,wind-up toys,"Robots is an incessantly banal tone poem of unmodulated hyperactivity. Set in a sci-fi milieu ripe for a satirical skewering of our own political, economic, and media culture, the filmmakers instead deliver a witless rendition of the Horatio Alger story devoid of either laughter or pathos. While it would be easy to accuse the studio of purposefully sanitizing the movie in order to make it go down better with the Whoppers with which it is being cross-promoted, it's far more likely that no one in a position of authority on this project possessed the basic abstract thinking skills necessary to propel the narrative into the sphere of literature.Apart from its mind-numbing monotony, the movie is primarily distinguished by its narcissism, whereby our Hollywood filmmakers posit that in the world of robots, the greatest robot of all is...a television star. That it never occurs to Robots' creators that men who are machines might not need televisions (either because they *are* televisions, or because they are, rather, entertained by houseplants in the same way that we are entertained by machines) is illustrative of the incredibly lazy writing at the heart of this movie.The animation itself is proficient and soulless. While the screen is always a hubbub of jittery activity, this is primarily to mask the fact that there is precious little dramatic *action* taking place. Instead what we have is a series of static dialog scenes decorated around the edges of the frame with wind-up contraptions to create the illusion that something is actually happening.Robin Williams delivers a garish, ego-maniacal, scenery-chewing performance as the voice of ""Fender"" that challenges the notion that an animated film is created by the artists who draw it (on computer or otherwise). Perhaps rather than an ""animated"" film, Robots should simply be called a ""rendered"" one."
37,Robots,1,10 April 2005,looks like a kids movie but not so great,"I took my kids to this movie today, and didn't realize it was not a rated G movie.After we left the movie, I looked it up and see MPAA Rating: PG for some brief language and suggestive humor. Not sure what that's all about, there was a protracted 1-2 minute scene with flatulence as the main character. That sort of stuff doesn't bother me so much, but there was other stuff in this movie that just didn't seem right for kids. For example, the ""evil CEO"" character has a mother that works in a scrap metal facility, and at one point the mother says something to her CEO son to the effect of ""you don't want to end up like your father?"" who they then show chained up and hanging around the scrap metal facility - a short segment of the movie which makes an effort to have fathers look bad I guess. Always good for a laugh I guess.It seems pretty common these days for movies that are supposedly for kids to have all sorts of adult topics, themes, and innuendo. Does Hollywood really think that the only way to get parents in to a kids movie is to have this covert subtext? Or is there something more sinister going on here?"
38,Robots,2,17 March 2005,It Takes More Than Big Stars,"I was completely unimpressed with ""Ice Age"". But I thought I'd give these folks a second chance with ""Robots"". They have labored under the notion that if they have a big name cast voicing the characters, that will be all they need. As a result, the story is at best weak, and the characters are completely uninteresting. There is nothing here to endear you to anyone in this movie. Other than ""Rodney Copperbottom"" I can't remember any other characters's names. They are all completely forgettable. Literally! I don't expect every computer animated movie to be a Pixar quality event, but this is pretty dreadful. This movie violates the number one rule of movie-making: don't be boring. This is boring!"
39,Robots,2,14 March 2005,Didn't hit any high notes,"Sorry, I may be one dissenting voice -- but this movie just did nothing for me and my family. Nary a funny line or bit, and not a single character to root for. Stale plot, script was totally unimaginative. Kids were fidgeting all around us. The opening sequence on the ""crosstown express"" held our interest, but it was downhill from there. Please explain why they needed Ewan McGregor and Halle Berry for these roles -- two actors with non-distinctive voices--those characters could've been voiced by ANYBODY. Robin Williams added not a thing to the cast. The crew of Robots were a confusing mess of voices that were hard to keep straight. Our rating: 2/10"
40,Robots,10,9 March 2005,"Frenetic, Frantic and very, very well done!","I'm a huge Pixar fan, and positively DETEST the garbage being pumped out by Dreamworks. I thought Ice Age was a very noble first effort, and a very nice film - so it was with much anticipation that I viewed this movie today (already open in Singapore, where I'm vacationing).NICELY DONE!!!! It's a bit exhausting, as they don't ""engineer"" the script with a normal ""down"" scene so you can catch your breath. This film is nonstop - and utterly satisfying.Robin William's first animated flick since Alladin - worth the wait.Artistic design was fabulous.. and even though I'd like to start an international boycott of all films that feature fart jokes, they probably had the best damn fart joke I've ever seen in a movie.Check it out - and leave room for it on your DVD shelf. This will be a movie that the kids will watch a zillion times and memorize every line."
41,Robots,3,18 March 2005,"Not ""Incredible"" if you catch my drift...","It is a fact that CGI film is an It-list item in Hollywood but that doesn't mean that every one that comes out is a good movie. Unfortunately for the thousands who have already seen this no one really warned them beforehand. This movie just doesn't have the writing to compare to Pixar or the Social Intelligence of Dreamworks to make it memorable or even good. It is a children's film, and the children will enjoy it, however, it is not enjoyable for a moment in story or humor or even acting for the older set, who , spoiled by the amazingly adult stories of Pixar and the snuck in tongue in cheek social and entertainment humor in Dreamworks.The animation is good, not great, but good. Paralleled to roughly the level of the original Shrek, it still seems very sugar coated. It lacks the break through that Pixar brings on a yearly basis, and the likable pseudo realism of Dream work, but still, it cannot be called bad, and unfortunately, this is the films only redeeming factor.The characters are idiotically typecast, and Robin Williams is stuck playing Genie, but without the magical power an flexibility that made the character and the movie in Alladin. HE, and almost all the cast are forced time and time again to result to levels of toilet humor (which, since the cast are all robots, makes an even lesser level of sense) and culture references already years behind (characters are seen singing hit me maybe one more time, one of the more painfully memorable pop songs of the turn of the century, during the climax, no less).It makes an effort to be everything, pixar and dreamworks wrapped into one package, with everything from two original songs, one of them a concluding number, and the fantastical world of pixars films, but falls so dismally Short that one cannot help but see th e movie as even worse by comparison.Avoid it unless the kids need to be distracted for a couple of hours.Or by The Incredibles DVD instead."
42,Robots,7,22 July 2006,Funny animation movie for all ages,"I expected an average animation movie, since I had not heard any clamor about this one, and most critics gave it not-so-great ratings .. But, in just the first few moments, I was surprised and felt exhilarated for having found a little gem with funny and smart dialog and awe-inspiring moments depicting how a robotic life could be ..The plot is predictable, somewhat stereo-type one: ""The young boy with great ideals arrives at the town; where an evil, money-worshiping company boss makes the life misery for town-folks, sucking every penny they got .. The boy helps them, which infuriates the boss, and later on with the help of towns people, stands up against the evil, wins the day, and everyone becomes happy"" But you still cannot expect a ""Fight Club"" like of plot and ending in a PG rating animation, can you ?? ..So, the quality here lies in the small events and surprises .. The way the robots have a haircut and massage, eat at a diner, feed toy-like pigeons in the park, transport around the city .. Just watching the environment inspires you .. Not one of the scenes, is unnecessary or dumb in this animation .. Every event related with the story has a purpose and may not be taken from the whole .. Mind you, this is a 90 minutes animation .. There is lot to watch here ..The movie is for all ages, that's for sure .. That is not a movie that you must force yourself to watch till the end, just to be near your child at the theater .. It has attractive factors for everyone .. The dialog is really smart in several scenes, and I doubt these are intended for 4 year olds (Alas the rating is not G) ..The animation may not be top-notch .. I must admit, it is a little more straightforward to create 3D animation with vehicles, robots and futuristic cities, rather than human faces and mimics, and organic matter .. But still the quality is there - that's not a low-budget-movie .. I especially liked the sound effects - the cute sounds which the flying invention of Rodney (the Hero) makes ..The movie may not be memorable as the likes of 'Finding Nemo' or cannot compete with the dialog of the 2D Disney movies of late 90s - early 2Ks in 'wittiness' level .. But this is a movie, that all animation fans and archivers (like me) should watch - and make space for a new DVD .."
43,Robots,8,26 September 2005,Rodney Copperbottom,"I liked the film. It wasn't up to the comic standards of ""Ice Age"" or ""Shrek"", but it was still entertaining and funny. The story is cute and the art is pretty fantastic, i love the whole robot world. I like the fact that the entire movie has a color scheme. Yes, the plot could have been better. Yes, Robin Williams, we could have expected Aladdin out of you once more. But alas, Aladdin, this is not. This also could have something to do with the writing and the plot, which weren't as good as Aladdin to begin with. It is never going to be one of my favorite movies of all time, but it is still a cute film and I probably will go out and buy it one of these days, to add to my collection."
44,Robots,,23 April 2005,Robin was best,Robin Williams was truly the star of the show. Robots was able to give him a leash to run with and explore his comic talent. He went wild with no 'restrictions' to hold him back. It was a role that allowed him to be a free spirit with his character and show off his real talent. Many people will disagree with me stating that his 'acting' was over the top but it was a release for him and he went wild with the part. The other actors tried their best to keep up with him with quirks and little jokes but nothing kept up to the level of Robin. Fender is his best role in the sense of comic relief. The Genie in Aladdin provided the release back then.
45,Robots,1,22 April 2007,All around awful movie,"A movie with excellent animation about a robot who doesn't have modern parts and must use hand-me-downs. He makes friends, gets his love interest, and defeats the villain. Sounds like it might be fun, right? WRONG The script feels like it was written by four year olds. Every single cliché is here, and some parts of the script just seem lazy. For example, the major city in the movie where our hero wants to go is called Robot City. Robot City. Why couldn't the writers have thought of something a little bit less dumb? All of the jokes are lame, especially the robot that begins dancing to a Britney Spears song.The story is not at all compelling, and you will probably find yourself bored and/or furious. I was both when I actually paid money to see this trash. The characters are complete idiots, and do not have any depth whatsoever. Do not see this movie. It is a waste of good animation on a 15 cent script. The producers knew it would make money because they had good voices, like Halle Berry and Ewan McGregor. Please save yourselves. Avoid this movie. Go stare at a wall or hit yourself in the face. Both will be more productive then watching this."
46,Robots,5,17 March 2005,Above average - just barely,"Well, it's not often I agree with Richard Roper over Roger Ebert, but the film just seemed a 90 minute, never-ending, self-congratulatory essay on the CGI.The story is thin, the characters fail to emerge (probably because there are too many of them), most of the celebrity voices seemed phoned in (why hire Ewan McGregor for a voice-over and then ask him not to sound like himself?) and the winks and nods to popular culture are just not numerous enough.The Fiestaware color palette is cool but the desaturation made the film look like a work print. And the Rube Goldberg roller coasters are somewhere on the other side of manic.Well, anyway, the design team won!"
47,Robots,,13 March 2005,Simply brilliant.........,"I have just come back from watching Robots and could not wait to read all the joyous comments about this film. They're not as frequent as I thought they'd be.There's a lot of stuff about how predictable the plot is and how tame Robin Williams is. There's a lot of comparisons to Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc. and so on.This is a kid's movie and in the first instance should be treated as such. At this level, it's simply brilliant. At a grown up level, there's gags to keep you interested and for movie goers there's a couple of superb references to a couple of sci-fi classics...but I'll let you look for them.This movie is plot infantile...but then it's supposed to be and Robin Williams is held back by the script which is a shame.So when you pitch this movie where it's supposed to be pitched...it's truly excellent.I recommend this movie without hesitation."
48,Robots,,11 March 2005,Dimension,"By now you probably know all the ordinary things about this movie: the story is trite, the characters are ordinary and except for Robin ordinarily acted, and the jokes are extraordinarily clever.This comment is about an important trend in animation that most commentors miss, the role of dimensionality and how well it is exploited in this movie.Pixar discovered this. After they made their character's bodies render visually with dimension, and after they gave the identity of the characters ""dimension"" (still unique to Pixar, it seems), they realized the power of moving them and us around in three-dimensional space. ""Nemo"" was set in an ocean purely because they wanted to be able to move in all three dimensions without having to make heavy explanations.The idea gained extra credibility when the ""door warehouse"" scenes in ""Monsters, Inc"" tested much better than expected.Its not like this is a great secret in the industry. Everyone is talking about it now, and the notion goes as far back as ""Citizen Kane""'s camera. Others have tried: ""Treasure Island"" was conceived to maximize the movement of the camera in threespace. So were parts of ""Van Helsing"" and the latest Potter.Oddly, some big investments that should have known better didn't, like the Spiderman splats.This movie does exceedingly well in moving us in three-space. As soon as we enter the city, we have that elaborate transit system. You notice the depth and are intended to. But after that, you take it for granted that you are disembodied and moving freely in threespace. It is a very clever construction, and unusual enough that it makes us accept the world we see. We would merely think of it merely as the Flintstones (or Jetsons) if we saw it with a ""normal"" eye. That movement of the eye allows us to shift realities quickly, so when Robin Williams does a Brittany Spears routine as combat, we accept it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
49,Robots,4,22 July 2005,"Lays an egg, but a Tiffany egg.","If you love the ever burgeoning list of computer animated flicks, it's worth seeing ""Robots"" just for the superb visual design. In fact, that's the only reason to see it.This is a ""schtick"" movie, like the classic Warner Brothers cartoons of the 40's & 50's. I can handle that for 3 or 4 minutes, but not for the 91 minute running time of this movie. The folks at Blue Sky have failed to learn what Pixar has always known: Story. Story. Story.""Robots"" treats us to a pastiche of set pieces stuck together by a plot that is so clichéd it's virtually impossible to put a spoiler in here because you've already seen it all before: Evil corporation, valiant naive hero, funny sidekick, ""you're okay just as you are"" theme. And it's really too bad because ""Robots"" is a visual treat. The gleaming surfaces and rounded designs remind me nostalgically of my parents 1955 Chevy Bel Air. But even there it doesn't always make sense. Whether something is a robot or not depends not on the story, but on whether they can get a joke out of it.See it for the visuals. Skip it for the story. It's one of those ""near miss"""" movies that will frustrate you, because it could have been great."
50,Robots,9,13 March 2005,Stellar Lineup - Stellar Film,"I walked into this film thinking it was going to be ""child's play"" and it turns out to be as heartfelt as Finding Nemo. It's a bit more slapstick, but the actors do an amazing job with the physical humor and the robots look amazing. Quite a few terrific robot/human jokes including the references to coffee and the male/female restroom icons. Robin Williams, as always, is hilarious and I hope they have video of him on the DVD in the sound booth because it's so easy to see Robin's facial expressions in the robot. I suppose that's a compliment to the animation crew too!!!! Greg Kinnear and Drew Carey are easy to spot (hear), and so is Mel Brooks. I was disappointed the film wasn't as ""big"" (wide) as I thought. It would have been nice to see this widescreen. The plot is predictable with a typical story of a boy's redemption story. It doesn't get too scary or in-depth in order to appease the kids. The oddest moment was a reference to Britney Spears and the entire theater (of kids) laughed. Wow! Can't believe 8 year olds understood the joke, and it was a reference to Britney Spears of several years ago!"
51,Robots,1,17 March 2005,Horrible Movie that should be seen by No-Bots!,"This movie was terrible. The jokes that were there were awful (i.e. aunt fanny), there were a bunch of puns that weren't at all punny (""Ladies and gentle-bots"") and the plot was incredibly loose to the point that it seemed just like a random series of un-funny events. A couple of other points... 1. That invention of Rodney's reminded me a LOT of Orbity from the Jetsons, an annoying thing on springs that adds absolutely nothing to the plot or development of anything.2. What was with the licensed music for no reason? If this is a fantasy movie, then why would it ADD to the world by having Chingy in it? NO!3. It seemed to have characters that added nothing to the plot just to fit in as many celebrity voices as possible (i.e. Jay Leno).4. The whole first scene with Bigweld Industries seemed to really be an attack at Eisner ousting Disney."
52,Robots,2,20 June 2005,Meh,"Since this movie wanders randomly all over the place, I thought I'd follow suit and offer some random thoughts: Ever notice how all movie-length cartoons are starting to look the same? All the characters have a handful of human-like expressions that are supposed to make the viewer identify with them, and these expressions are recycled over and over and over from one movie to the next. Watch the eyes, for example; they don't hold in one place, the character will say something and the eyes will go down a little bit, then to the side a little bit. The mouth will open to indicate realization. The eyebrows will raise to indicate hope. The brow will furrow to indicate contemplation. And there's always a smartass female character who won't take no guff from the men in the movie. This is why this movie failed, because it's exactly like every other cartoon movie made over the last fifteen years.Why on earth should there be male and female robots? Don't think about this too hard.Robin Williams is becoming increasingly irritating as he ages. In twenty years, his voice can be used to sandblast ships in dry dock. Mork needs to go back to Ork already. PLEASE.Why all the pop culture references? Because the writers were too lazy/uncreative/unmotivated to write a better script, that's why. Instead of a clever parody of technology, we get references to Britney Spears and 2001 a space odyssey. BFD.Why doesn't Madame Gasket have access to the most sophisticated robotics in the entire world of robotdom? She should have been able to wipe out Rodney and his friends with a snap of her fingers. Instead, five robots take out hundreds. Doesn't make any sense.I don't care about the robot's mission, their plight, their suffering. When something breaks, you fix it. So? What's the problem? Ratchet wants to sell upgrades instead of parts. Well doesn't Ratchet need parts too? Hard to understand. Don't think about it too hard.Why in the world does Rodney ""grow"" from an ""infant"" to an ""adult""? Don't think about this too hard.Is there any point to this movie? What did the robots accomplish in the end, the right to have spare parts instead of upgrades? Wouldn't you really rather have an upgrade than the same old parts? Given a choice between the stock part and a superior aftermarket upgrade, anyone would want an upgrade."
53,Robots,,2 April 2006,"Colourful, amusing fare but not clever or funny enough for adults","Young Rodney Copperbottom was always a curious sort so, when his father hits bad times, he decides to leave Rivet Town and head into Robot City. His aim is to take his inventions to his idol, Mr Bigweld, make a success of himself and return home able to help his family. However when he gets to Robot City he finds things a lot bigger than he expected and is even more surprised to learn that Bigweld Enterprises has been taken over by a new CEO  Ratchet, who is very much for selling rather than helping or benefiting robot society in general. Taken in to the disenfranchised parts of society by friend Fender, Rodney finds an entire underclass running out of parts and unable to afford expensive upgrades.With any big name animated kids film now, it is almost worth taking a look because the producers have learnt that what sells is something they can market to kids but also have plenty for adults to enjoy. So with Robots I thought it would be worth a look and early on the plot looked interesting even if the gags were fairly average. Sadly this approach continued to be the case in terms of the humour because, although I wasn't bored by it, there weren't that many funny bits and generally the humour was not that sharp. I was amused enough to keep watching but there seemed too many fart jokes etc and not enough smarter stuff around. The one liners here and there are fun enough but movie references (such as 2001) just seemed to be there for the sake of it rather than being inspired or hilarious.This was the same in the plot which seemed to offer a moral message about the power of corporations and expensive health care. It actually does this reasonably well even if the message is watered down as much as possible. Of course some viewers, such as myself, may find this message a bit rich coming as it did from the Fox Corporation but, either way, at least it was interesting. Again it too lacked teeth and seemed unwilling to actually produce the goods in terms of impacting story but it was interesting nonetheless.Despite a very impressive cast list, the voice work was generally only alright, mainly because the material wasn't totally there for them to work with in terms of emotional impact and character development. McGregor turns in a solid performance, likewise Berry but neither of them ever threatens to dominate the film. That prize is left to the support cast, in particular Robin Williams, who has been here before. When he is on screen he has enough energy to create laughs out of nothing but the downside of this is that it all feels lacking when he isn't around  which is too often. Kinnear is good fun as Ratchet, Brooks is fun while there are lots of nice turns from Tobolowsky, Broadbent, Carey, Giamatti, Roker, Tucci and Wiest. An impressive cast on paper and they all do well in little pieces but not as good as a whole as you would expect.Overall then this is still a good kids film but with the Pixar benchmark set so high, it is hard not to feel a little disappointed by a film that isn't actually that funny and, despite having a daring (in this corporate world) plot, doesn't actually do that much with it. Colourful amusing stuff but I wanted more that never came."
54,Robots,8,14 March 2005,Good film with enough depth to keep older children happy,"This is a well made and entertaining film. We took three children, all aged under ten, to see it, and all three enjoyed it. There was enough action to keep the younger children entertained, and enough of a plot to keep older children engaged.For adults, the film is worth seeing. The animators have fun with a robot version of 1950's America in the opening sequences, and with the big city of a later era when the focus of the movie shifts. There's a view of the underside of a city as well as the boardroom, with interesting characters. As Rodney Copperbottom, Ewan McGregor voices the type of role that Michael J Fox would have done a few years ago, and Jim Broadbent and Mel Brooks also contribute good turns. Halle Berry isn't given a great deal to do. Predictably, Robin Williams steals the show in his scenes.There are recurring themes about following dreams, which were well received by the children, and digs at makeovers, built in redundancy, and dissatisfaction promoted by advertising that will resonate with adults. A good family movie that's bound to do well on DVD, as well as at the cinema."
55,Robots,7,11 March 2005,A Mixed Bag of Tricks,"Robots seems to be wandering between 'absolutely superb' to 'absolutely banal'. On one hand, you have one of the most imaginative universe ever created and on the other the stereotypical characters are placed in one of the most predictable plots created since the dawn of the movie industry. However, I have to admire that the fact that they did try to put some life into this otherwise cheesy movie.That and the existence of Fender (voiced by the talented 'Robin Williams').The movie for all its worth have managed wonderfully in terms of technicality and animation. From the start you just can't help but admire the amount of detail, the amount of work that was put into every single screw, nut and bolt. The scene where the main character, Rodney and Fender met for the second time was enough for the ticket admission alone.The jokes here are a mixed bag. At first you have your usual fart gags courtesy of a certain Miss Fanny. I have to add that they have quite an amount of puns. Oh, heck they have a lot of puns. And if you're careful enough you might be able to catch a few innuendos here and there. Some of them don't seem to try so hard therefore you might sometimes find yourself smirking to rolling all over the floor with your sides aching.Now, the plot...with one glance any average moviegoer would know what would happen in the end. It offered nothing new, it's one of those journeys where one farm boy/out of town boy journeys to the big city in search of fortune only to be disappointed...blah...blah...blah! Considering that the last Fox's offering was 'Ice Age', I wasn't that surprised.Overall this would be a nice movie if your in mood to unwind and not think too much about the plot.I give 2 1/2 out of 4."
56,Robots,,13 March 2005,Lazy,"For all of the technical achievement, Robots is a lazy film much devoid of wit and charm. Most of this is probably due to the feeling of disengagement with cinematic metalwork and the viewer having no real concern for the ""lives"" of pieces of scrap. This is not helped by the film containing no real sense of menace from the baddie and having a script (due in no small way to Ganz and Mandel) that is for the most part smug and humourless. On top of this is a Robin Williams turn which just goes to prove how good he WAS as Genie! Long before the end of a mercifully short film, a large number of the kids in the audience had lost interest. The whole thing looked and felt like a 91 minute advert for the Nintendo DS game"
57,Robots,10,1 October 2005,This movie is awesome !:),"I liked 'Robots' a lot!Since Shrek was released, I didn't watched an animation movie that was so cool and with such a nice story! I found the idea of a world of robots and everything else projected for this world, very original,not to mention that the movie has two nice messages: To follow our dreams without never giving up, and also to make the world a better place.One of the coolest parts of the movie,that also has a social critic, is when Ratchet is talking with the employees of Bigweld's company, and says that if they don't make the robots feel bad about themselves, they will never sell and make profits for the company. Looks a lot with our society,since we live in a world of aesthetics and consumerism.I stay surprised that the rating of this movie is 6.4, while I think it deserves at least a 9."
58,Robots,8,7 March 2005,"Old story, but amazingly redone...","When the movie started out, I felt like I know totally what's gonna happen... and boy - was I in for a surprise! The overall plot is a bit predictable but the screenplay is awesome! The animation has a refreshing look and the movie has conjured up a funny image of the Robot world, something similar to what 'Finding Nemo' did with the Underwater world.The main characters are understandably less comic. Look out for some of the funny haracters like Robbin Williams'. An applaudable job by the whole crew - Overall, and 8/10 - loses out slightly on its plot predictability."
59,Robots,6,5 February 2010,The plot rings as hollow as the robots themselves,"Robots is a pretty good film that will probably keep your kids occupied and entertained, at least the first time they watch it. It's a fairly entertaining light family film with some good moments and just enough comedy to hold your attention, even if much of that comedy involves Robin Williams doing jokes that seem like hold-over material from the TV show ""Mork & Mindy"". But then your kids aren't old enough to know what that show is, so they won't be aware of the recycling.What this film really did for me was make me appreciate Pixar more. Unlike the maker of Robots and other high-tech CGI films, Pixar starts out with a solid story idea and then develops the CGI and the gags to support that idea. Technology has gotten to the point where dazzling effects are easier to do and cheaper than ever and filmmakers are forgetting that audiences ultimately want to see an interesting story, not a dog-and-pony show of the latest in graphics effects with a storyline that has the complexity of a 1930's serial thrown in to hold it all together. So, if you have small children, it might be worthwhile. If you are an adult, however, I think you'll be somewhat bored."
60,Robots,6,22 November 2009,"Inventive and technically impressive, but not as good in the script department","I watched Robots wondering whether I was going to love it or hate it. In the end, I liked it, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed too. The computer animation was definitely the best element to the movie, it was stunning with plenty of colourful, advanced and inventive visuals. I also thought the soundtrack was more than decent, I liked the premise and there are some characters that are endearing. The film does have a good message about following your heart. Not to mention a great voice cast, with Ewan MacGregor his usual charming and earnest self as Rodney, Greg Kinnear a nice surprise as Ratchet and Robin Williams wonderfully electric(and funny). There are some heart warming moments with Rodney and his family.However, as Bigweld Mel Brooks did disappoint; surprisingly there wasn't much to his character and Brooks sadly couldn't do anything with what he was given. While it was an enjoyable film technically, the story while constantly inventive and original takes a while to get going, and there is little character development. Also I got more the impression that Ratchet's mother Madame Gasket was more the villain than him. Speaking of Madame Gasket, I couldn't believe Jim Broadbent voiced her, totally unrecognisable and quite possibly the biggest casting surprise of the movie. The biggest flaw though was the script. I will admit I did laugh a few times, but that wasn't enough. Robin Williams did a great job and some of what he said was funny. However, the in-jokes weren't as funny as they should have been. It could have done with more wit and irreverence perhaps.All in all, I liked the movie. It is nice to look at and technically accomplished, and the voice cast in general do well, but the script wasn't sophisticated enough. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
61,Robots,10,18 June 2006,Fun for everyone!,"I've have never seen anything like it in the world! A world run only by robots, and no humans are even present. Well just because they are robots, that doesn't mean all robot movies are going to be all the same: Boring, Stoic, machines it what most people feel about them. Come on, people! Wake up and smell the battery acid! ""Robots"" will give you the nuts and bolts on how these machines live their life. And the laughs are non-stop. You have this robot named Rodney, a inventor who has big dreams on helping out robots. Then there's this junk robot Fender(Robin Williams), who's been around the city for the longest that he could remember. Rodney idolized Bigweld(Mel Brooks), the mack daddy of all helpers of robots. When he's held up by a corporate powerhouse, who was not here to be helpful, but to make an empire of his greedy self. Everyone looks up to Rodney as the Right arm of Bigweld. I liked the part where He asked ""Who wants to get fixed?"" and the robotic dog got scared. And the fake emissions made Aunt Fanny let out the big one which killed the lamppost. Anyone got a gas mask? HAHAHA! Then when everyone helped Rodney defeat the upgrades, That robot Fender(Robin Willaims) pulled out a Britney Gears! What a barrel of used gears, and a bottle of oil, this movie will leave you in stitches, except if you are a robot! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! Rating 5 stars!"
62,Robots,9,14 January 2006,Gotta Love It! Great Anitmated Movie,"We bought the DVD of Robots for the kids. I never thought anything would pull them away from MAdagscar but this film has just about done it. Everyday just about the kids pop this movie in, sometimes watching a couple of times throughout the day. The 1st time we popped it in there were quite a few moments when I just burst out into laughter. Some people take animated movies waayyyy to seriously. They want these heavy plots, sentimental sap... come on people we are not trying to take the kids to see a dramatic Oscar eligible film here. Kids just need to be visually entertained (which this film is so wonderful visually)while being amused for the most part and as long as it does that for the kids, I say Kudos! If I wanted something deeper for them, then I'd sit down and read them a good book. Anyone remember those? So let the animated movies be silly, fun, and entertaining. There is nothing wrong with that. I don't want to have to explain some deep emotional plot to the kids. Let's just laugh and have a good time. A couple of commenters made some incorrect references about the film. Rivet City, the 1st town in the movie is not ""the big city"". It's a very small town and had you paid attention, yes, everyone did know each other, that's why he went screaming telling everyone he was going to be a dad and that's why most of them congratulated him. He only ran a few blocks before he made it home so that should have given a clue there that it was a small town. The director even says so in the commentary that this movie is all about a kid leaving his small town to go make it big in the ""big city"" and they based the small town on what they thought it should be about or the myth of what everyone thinks a small town is; hence everyone knowing each other. A lot of people seemed to have a problem with a lot of references they made to other films or pop culture. Once again, in the commentary, you find out more of the reasons behind this. Like the Bigweld show with them opening the gate... he said he put that in there because he remembered growing up enjoying when Walt Disney used to come on and invite the kids into the world of Disney. He kind of wanted to simulate that with Bigweld which is why Rodney was so into the show and really wanted to go meet Bigweld and see Bigweld Industries. We all remember, well in my day anyway, growing up and dying to go to Disney World. And I seriously doubt they were attempting to make Fender confused about gender. Once again, had you paid attention, he lost his bottom half at the chop shop and in trying to escape just grabbed up the 1st pair of robot legs he saw. When he attached them they were fine, then ooops, a skirt came down and he realized it was a female bottom half but he had to get out of there quick or be melted down. So that was the joke there, he thought he had guy parts but they turned out to be girl parts that he was stuck with. And he did have a female love interest before any of that happened. Just taking it all too seriously people, lighten up. We enjoyed it immensely, low-end humor and all. Robin Williams made this movie funny for me. And I don't know about you all but I just loved Aunt Fanny. I had my cousin watch this and teased her that Aunt Fanny reminded me of her from the back. Guess what, when she saw it, she couldn't help but laugh. Every movie is not for everyone so for those of you who have yet to see it, judge for yourselves... if your lighthearted and just like to be silly and have fun some of the time, then you will enjoy this movie. I mean, in the end, it's a good uplifting, believe in yourself no matter what story."
63,Robots,8,20 June 2005,Wonderful!!!,"What a beautifully written movie. From the moment this movie started till the last flicker of light on screen I found myself caught up in the wonder that animated stories of my childhood provided. Technology has advanced greatly in the past twenty years, especially in the field of animation. I have found that some animated movies spend so much effort on the visual that the storyline falls apart or never makes an impact. This movie will not disappoint in either respect. The animation is top notch, with lifelike characters whose facial expressions and emotions are far more genuine than those of some of the actors we pay to see on screen. The story itself is a marvelous coming of age tale of a young robot who learns to believe in himself and brings together a mismatched gang of outmode robots to prevent their world from being overthrown by a pair of greedy, self-centred and completely unusual duo. The diversity of the characters mimics real life, and the message of being happy with oneself is delivered in a colourfully wrapped box with a big red bow. Notable characters who make the movie worth seeing: Fender - Robin Williams (phenominal performance... he has a gift, see this movie for William's alone) Rodney - Ewan McGreggor (he lends a perfect voice to this character... giving life to this innocent nieve character) Tim the Gate Guard - Paul Giamatti (this guy is just hilarious... playing this tiny little character on a huge power trip) I even enjoyed the musical score of this movie. This one is definitely a family favourite, and for children of all ages!reel2reel.blogspot.com"
64,Robots,6,15 April 2005,Robots Carry On the Muppet Tradition,"""Robots"" is a rollicking, laugh out loud ride through a mechanical alternate universe in the tradition of Jim Henson's Muppet movies.Unlike movies made from comic books that portray the central clash as between good and evil, this film follows the Muppet tradition of setting up the conflict as between paternal entrepreneurism vs. ruthless capitalism (like the fast food frog leg restaurant or the greedy landlord), though the villain we first meet is the newer Disney mode of the bland handsome dolt.As with the Henson approach, for every fart joke there are other visual and verbal jokes that intentionally go over the kids' heads, including many references for nostalgic baby boomers. Some of the references go by so quickly (including ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" ""The Hucksters,"" ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" ""Sesame Street,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""Britney ""Gears"") that they will probably only be appreciated on the endless re-plays of the DVD/video tape, while other satirical elements go on too long (such as references to ""Singing in the Rain,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Braveheart"").The good will is further tested in the over long climax that seems to be an endless chase scene and could be considerably shortened, even within a movie that's only 91 minutes long as it is.The voice over actors are mixed in their effectiveness, with the character actors being the most interesting and the stars too bland, particularly Ewan McGregor as the lead, and whose American accent wavers. Robin Williams is pretty much replaying his ""Aladdin"" shtick, though with fewer impersonations.The music is the weakest element, with virtually no original songs.As much of the credits I sat through had no additional jokes, which was atypical for this genre.The movie has a vague message about the importance of recycling over planned obsolescence."
65,Robots,,30 March 2005,What an AWESOME movie!,"I am 23 & recently went and saw this movie with my husband. Let me tell you, I haven't laughed so hard in a looooong time. This movie is perfect for kids and Big Kids like me! What I liked the most about this movie is that it wasn't overly aimed at adults, such as Shrek (""I think he is compensating for something""). There were no hidden themes, so to speak. There are good lessons in this movie. This is a great family movie and I have told my husband I would go see it again in theaters and I want to buy it as soon as it comes out on DVD! Plus there are trailers for Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (coming out May 19th) and for Ice Age 2! Hope you enjoy Robots as much as I did!"
66,Robots,8,20 March 2005,More fun than I expected.,"I just returned from watching this surprisingly good movie. I went with my husband, son (14) and daughter (9) -- all of whom came away liking it. The plot was predictable, but the cleverness with which the story was illustrated was wonderful. We especially liked the way the animators and artists created an entire world which felt real. My son commented on the fact that several ""cameos"" that would have in other movies been dropped as soon as the gag was over, were actually brought back later in the movie. He felt that this attention to detail brought the quality up and made you care more about the Robots' world. Oh, and the Rube Goldberg inspired moments were absolutely dazzling!"
67,Robots,7,18 March 2005,Everything here is something...,"The robots in this movie are sort of like people...but, you know, not. They're robots. What confuses me is that everything else is a robot, too. A fire hydrant, a streetlight, a drum. Then there's a garbage can that's also a robot...but in another scene there's another garbage can that's...just a garbage can. What are the rules/logic to this crazy robotic world? Am I just over-thinking things a bit too much, or what? I'm sure the 5-year-olds in the audience won't care. It's cute, goofy stuff, right? I don't know! It all just bugged me.Robots continues the trend of animated films that appeal to all ages, right along with the all-star voice cast. It has the goofy stuff for the kids as I mentioned, but I think a more mature audience can take some meaning out of it, too. I think there is an underlying social message to Robots that deals with the big corporations, consumerism, and brainwashing- actually, enforcing- needs for a better self image (""Why be you, when you can be new""). What struck me was the fact that the villain Ratchet, just one man (uh, robot), was such a threat because he had so much control and power and had everyone brainwashed. But, he himself was actually brainwashed by the even more evil villain, his mother. They got the control after getting rid of the former leader, Bigweld. Everyone looked up to Bigweld. The entire society was so dependent on him that when he was gone and Ratchet had taken over, they were completely helpless and just went with the flow. They questioned their new leader and complained of course, but they didn't do anything about it. Finally, at the end, thanks to the bravery of Rodney Copperbottom, the entire city started an uprising and actually fought back. This would be a good movie to analyze in contrast to our society. Or, maybe I'm just reading into this further than I should, and I'm giving the makers of this movie way too much credit. Once again, I don't know! Robots doesn't really reach up to the greatness of movies like The Incredibles or Finding Nemo, but it was enjoyable for the most part. I didn't find my self laughing too much. I laughed out loud only once, and the saddest thing about that is that it was at the fart joke. It's visually stunning and all, but when they showed a wide shot of the ""amazing"" Robot City as the joyful mystical wondrous music plays, I wasn't impressed or astonished at all. I didn't feel it with this one. We have the huge celebrity cast, but who really cares anymore? Robin Williams returns to animated character acting, but his performance shies in comparison to Genie in Aladdin. Story is always more important than the cast, and it was a generally good story, but I just wasn't as impressed with this as I was with many many other animated films.I guess what I'm trying to say, or what advice I'm trying to give about seeing this movie, is that it shouldn't be the top of your list of animated movies to see. If you've seen Toy Story, Shrek, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, The Inredibles, or any of their sequels, and are still craving more animated entertainment, go ahead and see Robots. If you haven't seen any of the other movies I've listed here, then I wouldn't recommend rushing to see it right away, 'cause you have some serious DVD renting to do! My rating: 7/10"
68,Robots,1,10 March 2005,This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Honest.,"*Spoilers Within* I went and saw this movie, ""Robots"" on a whim with some friends of mine. I was hoping, first of all, to have been doing anything else, but when faced with the option of doing homework or seeing what may be a good movie I felt the need to take a risk.So I walked into the theater, my friends and I somewhat excited and somewhat fearful of what was about to be shown before us, and then it began. I'd like to say that this was the single moment where my night went from bad to worse.We sat there, remaining optimistic about the film, but even seconds into the movie we knew it was going to be a disaster. The movie opens with a mother and a father robots making allusions to ""making a baby"" while proceeding to ""make it"" through ""15 hours of labor."" The family next to us seemed amused, so my friends and I kept our mouths shut, but, there is only so much someone should have to go through.As the scenes slowly marched on, it was as if the only thing keeping this movie alive was my naive sense of hope and wonder what twists and turns the movie could throw at me to make it somewhat enjoyable. We watched the cornucopia of montages flashed before us, flooded with made-for-the-movie pop songs, and references to ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Star Wars,"" and, well, nothing else really, there was no real material.So after the onslaught of poor jokes passes us by, the plot shows up somewhat as a classic ""believe in yourself"" story, a la Disney. We weren't too thrilled about this, but hey, it's a kid's movie, how much worse could it get? Well, a lot.I don't feel like going into the details, but I don't believe that pouring acid into my eyes would have been too far off plausible solution. The star cast does not shine, the animation is poor, the jokes fall flat every time, and worst of all, Robin Williams.Don't get me wrong. I love Robin Williams. Seriously, if I had a chance, I wouldn't think twice about taking a bullet for him or taking a drunk-driver driven car for him. But in Robots. Oh My. What I wanted was ""Aladdin"" Robin Williams, but I could have passed for ""Jumanji"" or ""The Birdcage"" Robin Williams, but just with the sappy plot and rigidity the studio must have given him, all you got to see was ""Toys"" Robins Williams. After seeing that, I started to cry.So, in conclusion, I think the movie is best expressed by this little situation. Towards the end of the film, there is a scene where Robin Williams recreates ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" by Brittany Spears. At that exact moment, my friends fell on the floor of the theater, arched himself up like in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" and screamed to cinema gods ""WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Basically, this is the worst thing I've ever seen and I hate myself for ever taking the time to see it. I called everyone in my phonebook to tell them to avoid it, and well, I think with this, I've redeemed myself."
69,Robots,,16 March 2005,Robot malfunction,"I quickly looked at the comments from other users and I wonder if we saw the same movie. I really disliked this movie. To keep it short I found the animation uninspiring, the dialog lame, the plot line boring and I felt a lot of jokes fell flat. I felt a lot of scenes were sort of just put there to make things seem exciting and thrilling but in the end had no point to it. For instance the transportation scene...it's cool and all but it kind of left me feeling the animators just haphazardly thought about it. I am unsure what exactly happened in the middle of the movie because I fell asleep but I did wake up at the end and I wasn't that impressed. Robin williams, ewan mcgregor and halle berry---were all wasted here. I'm glad ""The incredibles"" came out yesterday."
70,Robots,8,14 March 2005,20th Century Fox and the world of computer animation,"So, the years continue to go by, and animation doesn't get tired of winning points with the audience and opportunities with the market. It was since ""Toy Story"" that computer animation decided to become very important, with Pixar creating ""Bugs"", then ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."", until they finally got the Oscar for ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles"". Amazing. However, the rest of the studios worked their own stuff. Dreamworks was very intelligent, I must say; developing ""Shrek"" (also an Oscar) and my personal favorite movie in computer animation: ""Antz"".And there was this other studio, 20th Century Fox. They made ""Ice Age"", a funny and entertaining film that everybody liked. I think the same could happen with ""Robots"".When it comes to animated family movies, the whole thing doesn't have to be very complicated, and we should learn to accept that. These are movies that everyone will watch, especially the little ones. I'm not telling you to become a little boy when you watch this film, but just to accept it as it is. Like this, you won't be disappointed or angry when the plot talks about hope and faith. ""Don't give up"", Rodney Copperbottom's father says to him. ""Never stop dreaming"". Although they are not treated in a deep way, the film has deep messages. Yes, we've heard of them before...So what? The movie shows to us, like not many animated movies do, the beginning of the main character's life. We get to meet him as he grows up, and he plans his future. ""He's destined for something big"". This is really interesting for an animated movie, and more if besides the story, the movie provides you incredible graphics and visuals, making it beautiful to watch. It's a pleasure, visually. Believe or not, the writers took their time to develop the most important characters a little bit more (they couldn't go much farther). You have the ""dreamer"", the one who wants to be someone. Then you have the girl, in a love story not very believable; the girl is on the enemy side, but she eventually will join the ""dreamer"". The teacher, or the inspiration, who has given up, but somehow will reunite strength and fight again. The friend, or guide in the new world, as in every animated movie. There can't be one only character. And then the band. The group of people who will encourage the ""dreamer"" to do things right.I must apologize for talking like this, but that's just the objective part, because when you watch these movies, you have to be subjective; it is the only way. My recommendation to you is that you go in there and try to have a good time (I could be risky and say you'll have it; nothing can go very wrong).You will probably get out of the cinema thinking that ""you can shine, no matter what you're made of"". This encourages people (mostly kids) to create new things; it's a brave project in different ways. If you don't want to accept it, reject the irony; but if everything seems familiar, it's because it's a family movie. Can you ask anything else from a family movie? The end seems also a little bit (a little much) like all the other animated films we see today, but with the subtle humor and the believable and very friendly characters, we forget about this. Just like ""Ice Age"", 20th Century Fox has created another delightful piece of work. And I mean that in all the sense of the word."
71,Robots,8,12 March 2005,Much better than I expected!,"I wasn't expecting much out of this movie, even though I'm a huge Robin Williams fan, especially hearing that it was from the same people as ""Ice Age"". I was very surprised! The cast is top-notch, the story is well-written, and caters to adults as well as children, and delivers a good message without beating the viewer over the head with it. The visual effects are awesome, and it captured the attention of everyone, even my 5-year old who gets bored with EVERYTHING within 15 minutes! The dialogue is funny and there are jokes for young AND old alike. (A few I'm sure the kids didn't get, but my husband I laughed out loud.) I guess what I liked best is that the characters aren't sugary and sappy and neither is the storyline. Even the songs in the movie are good. It's an all-round good movie, not just for kids, but the whole family."
72,Robots,,10 March 2005,Perfect animation,"I've just saw the movie on an IMAX screen...I was really late so I had to seat almost first row...but from there I could really appreciate the magnificent work of animation.There are a lot of little details that make this movie worth of seeing three to four times just to see the flawless animation.The story is the classic ""stand up for your dreams/be yourself"" but it's not cheesy and the gags are excellent. I saw it in Spanish though but I will see it again in English with subtitles.Each year there have been more and more computer animated films and hopefully the forthcoming will have the level of excellence of this one."
73,Robots,,7 March 2005,A Nutshell Review: Robots,"This film is ingenious, in the way the story narrates and transplant everyday life and events, into their robotic equivalent. It brings the phrase ""Giving birth after 12 hours of labour"" to a new dimension, and so we begin, with the birth of robot ""Rodney Copperbottom"".While growing up in Rivet Town suburb, he experiences the simple life, living with ""hand-me-down"" spare parts and upgrade pieces from relatives, before realizing his dream and ambition of becoming an inventor, just like his idol Big Weld, a fuddly duddly corporate big wig, who cares about the robotic society, giving it back to it, and encouraging everyone to live their dream.But all's not well when Rodney visits the big city - his idol has become a recluse, and the corporation he left has become the exact opposite from what it was founded - profits and the bottom line matters, and something sinister is brewing between the new CEO and his mum, who runs the city's smelting plant. The narrative seems suspiciously familiar that point on, like you've seen it before somewhere, but the robotic premise breathes new life into recycled themes.The themes in the movie are never fully developed, partly because it's supposed to be enjoyed by children as well, and also because it clocks in at a relatively short 90 minutes. Themes like corporate responsibility, living your dreams, and consumerism - the need to perpetually upgrade even when you don't have a need to. Perhaps with more time, and if wanting to veer into those direction, we'll get more beef, but I must remind myself, this is essentially a children's film - nothing to deep please to get a kid's attention span.There are beautiful set action pieces with everything happening at the same time, and robotic animation that look so real, you thought they actually built the robots for this film! While there are big names who lent their voices to this film, Robin Williams stands out (as always) and is a riot in this one. From the minute he begins, he is an absolute scene stealer, right up until the finale scene, though I must add that it does seem a little muted, given that he only has his voice to bring his wit across, rather than experiencing the full repertoire of what Robin is capable of! The music in this film plays an important part in the narrative as well, and at times, contribute a lot to the slapstick scenarios. From Baby One More Time to Right Thurr, the filmmakers have picked the right hits for the right moments for maximum effect.Though the ending, like all cartoons, are happily ever afters, I felt a sad tinge of disappointment at the lack of what I felt was the norm of animation film these days - no blooper clips or easter eggs, nor fancy end credits for this film. Kind of an anti-climax after a fun rip-roaring session, lacking an encore."
74,Robots,7,8 January 2010,"Could have been a better follow-up to ""Ice Age"", but overall, it's another good effort from Blue Sky Studios","Blue Sky Studios, a CGI animation studio, made their feature-length debut in 2002 with the hit movie, ""Ice Age"", and released this follow-up, ""Robots"", in 2005, which turned out to be more polarizing. I first saw this second full-length movie from the studio about four years ago, in early 2006, before ever seeing anything else from them, including the original ""Ice Age"" for some reason. I saw every installment in the ""Ice Age"" trilogy for the first time within the past couple months, and saw the CGI studio's adaptation of Dr. Seuss' ""Horton Hears a Who!"" the year before that. After watching all those, I decided to watch this one again. I think I was fairly impressed the first time, but can't remember much from that viewing at all, and it may have improved the second time.In a world completely inhabited by robots, Rodney Copperbottom is born and raised in Rivet Town. His parents are Herb and Lydia. Rodney idolizes a renowned inventor named Bigweld, and as a young man, he leaves home and sets out to robot city, where he intends to present his invention (a gadget called ""Wonderbot,"" which he made to help his father with his dishwashing job) to Bigweld and work for his company, Bigweld Industries. However, when he gets there, he soon discovers that they no longer take new inventions and his idol inventor no longer runs the company! It has been taken over by Ratchet, an evil, greedy robot who just wants to make as much money as possible! Bigweld Industries no longer sells spare parts, and instead offers expensive upgrades. Older robots are taken to the Chop Shop and destroyed by Ratchet's mother, Madame Gasket! Rodney meets several other robots in the city, including two siblings, Fender and Piper, and stays with them, along with others, at Aunt Fanny's house. The young Copperbottom starts to repair robots in the city, and quickly becomes very popular, but Ratchet and Madame Gasket plan to have him destroyed for this! The animation here is amazing, with the colours, robot characters, and backgrounds! It seems one can always expect great animation from Blue Sky Studios. I don't think I could describe anything else about ""Robots"" as amazing, but there are other things that help make it entertaining, including humour. There are lots of scenes that made me laugh, such as Rodney's mother's reaction when she learns that he's leaving Rivet Town and Tim the Gate Guard pretending to let Rodney into the Bigweld Industries building and then shutting the gate on him. The Fender character adds so many funny gags to the film, with Robin Williams providing his voice! If you think the Genie in Disney's ""Aladdin"" (also voiced by Williams) is funny, I think Fender would make you laugh as well, and could remind you a lot of the Genie with his antics! Now, some of the humour is pretty juvenile, including jokes about Aunt Fanny's giant rump, and the armpit farting in her house leading to a real fart from her, but it could be worse. It also helps that the film has generally likable characters on the good side, there's action and suspense, and there are times when the story gets somewhat touching. Around the beginning, the movie may seem like it was a just a LITTLE rushed, with scenes sometimes changing too quickly, but I think it gets better as it goes along.I'm not sure exactly why I could remember so little of this Blue Sky Studios effort from my first viewing, but I think I'm going to remember a lot more from my second. Some people may describe it as forgettable, and maybe I could agree with them after I first watched it, but after seeing it again, I'm not so sure. I can see why this film isn't as popular as so many highly acclaimed Pixar movies, but have to say I disagree with those who don't like it at all. The animation, humour, characters, action, story, and touching moments aren't quite enough to make ""Robots"" a masterpiece, but they certainly are enough to make it satisfying overall. Maybe there's more for kids than adults in this movie, but many adults could enjoy it as well. If you're a fan of computer animation and family adventures, I wouldn't expect this to be the best CGI movie you've ever seen, but you could still find it worth watching. It might even improve with a second viewing."
75,Robots,7,24 November 2005,A little for everyone,"The movie was entertaining and the special effects marvelous. Often I rate my movies taking into consideration how often I have to move around in my seat. If I do so too often, it is an indication I would rather be somewhere else, doing something else. This was not the case.I can't believe that the adult jokes and innuendos are a legitimate cause for controversy. Between MTV, popular music, school and the hood, most eleven and twelve year olds (outside of Amish America) will hardly be tarnished by them. Who Shot Roger Rabbit? may not have had the quips nor the written adult gags but was infinitely more sexually suggestive and ran with a PG rating. If anyone did not understand the adult humor, chances are they did not pay much attention to it, so what's the harm? More importantly for the kiddies, the movie had a moral and a positive one. This cannot be said for most of the blood and gore special-effect laden trash we are constantly being bombarded with.It is possible the makers of the movie added most of the adult gags to avoid boredom, and who can blame them? Let us nor forget a lot of adults went to see this movie with their children, and were entertained by these ""extras."" Let's not be sanctimonious hypocrites. It was a movie intended to be enjoyed by the whole family. What's wrong with that?"
76,Robots,6,3 October 2005,Needed A Few Upgrades,"The trend in animation these days, it seems, is to utterly ignore the failures of George Lucas. Character and story flutter helplessly behind the brazen will of visual splendor. That said, visuals in this film are excellent. The inventive scenes involving travel or contraptions are without parallel. The inspiration for individual portions of this film should have carried to whole project, but....well, the frame was too unstable.Movies are, after all, like skeletons; every piece must fit into the other for the item to move smoothly. this is not so with Robots. the voice acting is excellent, the designs are great, and many of the jokes are very charming (though I could have done without the ""fart jokes""). This film has been compared to ""Shark Tale,"" Dreamworks' other recent failure, but Robots comes far, far closer to the prize. Here's where it falls short:This is an ensemble picture. There are many lovable and unique characters in it for us to meet and identify with. Trouble is, we never meet them. They run past, tap dancing and smiling, but never sit still long enough for us to identify them, let alone identify with them. Near the close of the film, one of the robots makes an uncharacteristic stride into heroism, and only my experience as a film-goer allowed me to see that it was uncharacteristic. I felt as if i'd hardly even known him before, so the change seemed unimpressive. And if I barely caught it, you can be sure it was mostly lost on kids.Many of the characters we do really meet and get to know a little are snatched from us without explanation. Halle Berry's character, Cappy, shows no individuality at all, save her resistance to Ratchet (black hat) and her attempt to side with Rodney (white hat). I mean, really--are we supposed to like her because she's shiny? I thought this picture was about the beauty of the Rusties; the true nature of oneness is society. Everyone in the film seems to lose perspective without any motivation at all, from Bigweld (on whom the whole plot turns, yet whose actions seem at best vague) to Madame Gasket, whose dastardly scheming seems without cause altogether.We see here the fumbling that happens when great, talented animators refuse to work their storyboards to perfection and coherency. The heathens in society say that animation is only for kids, and I despise that argument, but even if that were true, one thing is indisputable:Kids deserve better."
77,Robots,8,29 September 2005,"Dull, clichéd plot drives dazzling action in stunning mechanical world","The fabulous animation, almost non-stop dazzling action sequences, good physical and verbal jokes and a standout performance by Robin Williams make up for an anemic, shopworn, clichéd story and stereotypical characters.All the inventiveness in the movie was evidently focused on creating the vast, intricate clockwork world populated by robot people, animals and talking gadgets. It's all set in a very inventive retro environment reminiscent of the early decades of the 20th century - the characters often crazily resemble the household appliances of the day.The film was very crisp and the colours luscious - there's an upbeat, funky soundtrack too. This was an entertaining movie, worth watching over again to catch all the background details and period references missed the first time through."
78,Robots,10,29 June 2005,Goey Rating: GFF (Great Family Film),"Robots was a great movie. Made by the creators of ""Ice Age"" this movie is a fun movie through the whole thing. Rodney a teen trying to find his place in the world lives in a world of robots he strikes out on his own to become an inventor. He makes some great friends that help him achieve his dreams. They are also a bunch of misfits who have a variety of unique problems. The colors are vibrant thought-out, the songs are entertaining, and the theme is strong. ""See a need, fill a need"". This is a great movie for small kids and for older kids alike. Even the parents will enjoy this movie. I loved this movie and will enjoy it forever and ever. One of my all time favorites."
79,Robots,8,6 April 2005,A winner with my kids,"The proof is in the pudding a they say. I have two small children of 3 and 5 and also a 14 yr old daughter. Finding a new film for them to watch time and time again is a rare blessing but this one is a winner. It's been a long while since I've seen them sit so quietly through a whole film and then ask to watch it again straight after. The last film that had this appeal was ""Finding Nemo"".And for us adults ... I loved it, the visuals were superb, the humour was great and there is plenty of stuff going on in the background to be re-discovered on the re-run (yes, I have to sit with the kids sometimes too) A crackerjack little movie for the whole family"
80,Robots,,24 March 2005,Great family movie!,"Robots is a classic coming-of-age-against-the-odds story that has worked so well in so many movies. Making the characters robots gives them comedic capacities that would not exist in animations where the characters approximate humans. The plot and animation are great for younger kids, but the comedy also works for adults. My teen-ager and I got a lot of hold-your-sides laughs.One thing that I really enjoyed about the story line was how the parent bots express real emotions and display realistic parental behaviors. The mother is all emotional and doesn't want her son to go off to the big city, but Dad understands his son's need to discover himself and is willing to let him go, knowing that it is part of growing up. This adds a foundation of realism so that viewers will connect emotionally and be drawn into the story."
81,Robots,,22 March 2005,"Great animation, no story","My husband and I went to see this movie over our spring break at my insistence. The only reason we did not walk out on the movie is because we paid money to sit there and see a movie. The Star Wars preview at the beginning of the movie was great, but not worth the price of admission. Truth be told, it looked like it would be a good movie, but it fell short. Yes, the animation was terrific, some of the best we've seen. What there was of a story, however, was seriously lacking. The movie was predictable and pointless. For a good story, you shouldn't reuse the same old plots and elements, come up with something new, we saw bits and pieces of many many other movies and stories, and the characters all seemed reused. Another good element for any decent story is to have characters, especially a main character that the audience can care about one way or another. We did not care at all what happened to the main character in this movie or most of the other characters. The only character that I actually liked was Wonderbot. He was cute. Robin Williams was funny, at times. However, he distracted from the movie and other characters far too much. If Robin Williams is going to be in a movie, then he should be the main focus of the movie, if he is not, then he is just distracting. Good main characters quality, not good secondary character quality. It seemed like the movie was just one big showcase for their terrific animation, and used big name stars to help hid the fact there was no real story and it was hard to care about any of the characters. This could have been a good movie, but it wasn't."
82,Robots,7,11 January 2017,The Price of Automation!,"I find it hard to be too hard on animated films. There is generally a creative idea that springs into action and the results are what then fits the mold. It's a ""what if"" thing. Obviously, many non-animated films also start with this premise, but here we can create whatever visual world we want. The sky's the limit. Here, we have a world of robots, who lead lives like humans, but who have different shapes and sizes and functions. They integrate into this world and do their thing. Some have hopes and dreams. Rodney Copperbottom is a dreamer and an inventor. He wants his inventions to be noticed, so he packs his things and heads off to find his hero, Mr. Bigweld, who holds the future of enterprising robots in his hands (are they really hands?). He arrives, but the big boss is nowhere to be found. He engages the help of a collection of outcast robots, one voiced by the late Robin Williams, to go on a quest for information. This is a nice movie with no great pretensions."
83,Robots,8,30 September 2016,Aged really really well,"I find that this movie has aged really really well, while a lot of other Pixar / Disney / feelgood movies really didn't. movies like this often leave me in a cringe due to their forced ""haha look at how funny this is!!!!111!"" factor being so high, this movie did not force too much emotion in everything at all. most things just got rolled in. some things where still cringe worthy, especially the ending scene but it felt like they where pretty self aware of that. the plot is incredibly stereotypical but that didn't hurt the movie, it was easy to follow and that made it easy to look at the beautiful imaginary and boy this movie looks good! for its time but even nowadays it looks incredible! they really dedicated themselves to a theme and stuck with it. I always loved the concept of imagery like this, create a world made of ordinary things to make complex images. and that is what this movie feels to achieve, even though they did not quite do that, they did leave the same feeling when watching it. the movie is essentially this art form:Https://Ishmam {dot} files {dot} Wordpress {dot} com/2013/03/8237f5cf7e1ba75f7496901367863 427 {dot} Jpgyou can just keep looking at the scenes without getting bored one bit."
84,Robots,7,13 November 2014,An under-seen gem that shines despite a formulaic story,"While the story isn't particularly original or substantial, ROBOTS is a fun film for kids that has plenty of visual creativity. While a plot synopsis probably isn't necessary, here goes. Rodney is an aspiring robot inventor who moves to the big city to make his dreams come true, but along the way he has to deal with an evil corporate tyrant who threatens to turn old robots into scrap metal. First of all, I have to say this movie has one of the best voice casts ever assembled. Ewan McGregor plays the main character Rodney Copperbottom, and is joined by Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Robin Williams and Mel Brooks, to name a few. Every single actor brought their character to life vibrantly and with humor. Of course, with an animated movie you can't not discuss the visual elements. Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age and Rio) did an awesome job bringing this robot world to life. It kind of reminded me a little of steampunk, but more colorful and sanitized for children. There's also a number of stunningly creative sequences which are Rube Goldberg-esque in their complexity. The humor is also worthy of mention, because there's plenty of jokes that the kids will get, and some for the parents as well. There's even some hilarious usage of (then-current) pop music, and a couple other original songs. When it's all said and done, this movie isn't really the most original in terms of plot, but there are positive messages for kids and enough visual style to spare."
85,Robots,9,28 May 2014,Miles better than Ice Age,"I really do not understand the hate for this movie, particularly Williams' performance. I loved his character, and I did not find him even slighty annoying. I think that was genius casting, because he fits the character of Fender perfectly.Also, the message is superb and is handled brilliantly. In fact, I'd say there are 3 main morals. ""You are perfect no matter who you are"", ""Never give up"" and ""see a need, fill a need."" They are all truly fantastic morals.My only flaw with the movie is that they didn't show the transport enough! That scene where Rodney and Fender take the ""train"" to Bigweld Industries is genius and amazingly imaginative. I wanted more!So overall, 94/100, great picture for kids, and has enough humour to keep adults entertained. I honestly have no idea why nobody talks about it like they do with Toy Story and Finding Nemo and other animations. Because in my opinion, Robots is up there."
86,Robots,7,7 November 2011,Fox Animations' pretty good mechanic film,"With the success of all the computer animated movies from the greatest animation companies in the movie kingdom like Pixar and Dreamworks Animation, Fox Animation Studio along with Blue Sky Studios does it better with the Ice Age franchise, Horton Hears A Who, and Rio, but before those two films, they released their mechanical robotic film, ""Robots"".It tells the story about Rodney Cooperbottom (voiced by Obi-Wan Kenobi--I mean Ewan McGregor), a genius inventor who plans to meet Mr. Bigweld in Robot City. Once there, he makes friends with a group of misfit robots led by Fender (voiced by Robin Williams) and Piper (voiced by Amanda Bynes). But when Rodney then realizes that with the master inventor has disappeared, two evil junkyard robots, known as Ratchet and his mother Madame Gasket, plans to outmode all of the robots of Robot City and it is up to Rodney and his friends must find a way to find Bigweld and save the day.For a computer animated film about robots, it's a very overwhelming idea. Although, there are some missing points I might follow.If I had to sum up the plot with two words, I say: Clichéd and Predictable. The beginning and ending seemed to drag themselves in order to further the plot (it has a few moral lessons such as follow your dream, shine no matter what you're made of, you name it) and it lacks the heart of Disney and Pixar.But aside from those, the computer animation is very lovely. It succeeded in perfectly detailing the look of Rodney's hometown, Robot City, Mr. Bigweld's company, and the Chop Shop and the character models are amazing.The characters are extremely likable. Rodney seems to be pretty tolerable when he tried to follow his dream. His parents were decent right from the beginning and the end. Fender, Piper, and the other misfit robots like Lug, Crank, and Aunt Fanny were great with their comedic moments. The townspeople in Robot City along with the ones from Rodney's hometown weren't important to the story, but were quite enjoyable. Fender's love interest Loretta Geargrinder, although not given enough screen time, was also decent like Rodney's parents. The two main villains, Ratchet and Madame Gasket, weren't exactly my favorite villains, but since they were menacing, they're weren't that bad.The comedy is hi-jack hilarious thanks to its clever writing. The two scenes where the robotic version of the Tinman from The Wizard of Oz, one of the robots dancing, and the during the battle scene where Fender defeats Madame Gasket's robots by doing the Britney Spears dance were very creative when it comes to computer animated comedies.The music from John Powell, although not exactly his greatest music score in a film, is actually quite enjoyable to listen to.Robots isn't on par with Pixar and Dreamworks along with Ice Age, but talented voice actors and hilarious comedy make this movie worth watching. Adults won't like the plot, but I'm pretty sure the kids will like it as long as they watch it over and over again."
87,Robots,,12 February 2008,It's okay but just okay...,"I give it five out of ten. The animation was really good so that is most of the reason why it gets five points out of ten and not an even lower score. It just wasn't that interesting or engaging of a plot. Even for a Disney movie there wasn't enough of a story there. So the robot's on his own little journey, finds his way, learns about life, yada yada yada... It wasn't too bad, it's not that it was bad, I just think the premise had a lot of potential but it didn't live up to it. Even though it wasn't bad it just wasn't that good, either. Most of the voices were well done but Robin Williams started irritating me after a while."
88,Robots,7,6 November 2005,English version cut and re-dubbed,"Not a bad movie, but completely forgettable, also a little confusing - it didn't seem Bigweld had much motivation for his actions.However, what was annoying for me, is the English version was messed around with. Aunt Fanny became 'Aunt Fan', I suppose an obvious cut given the meaning of the word 'fanny' in English is much more offensive than in American. Even so, why was Terry Wogan dubbed in as the voice of Mr Gasket? It annoys me when movies get pointless re-dubs and changes (as in Harry Potter and the 'Sorcerer's' stone for the American market).I'm not a movie snob, I just think that English language TV shows and films should be left alone for other English language markets. I'd much rather see the original, than some edited version.So 7/10 for the film on it's own merits, 5/10 for the English version."
89,Robots,7,10 April 2005,"A week story, but good animation","""Robots"" follows in the same path as Blue Sky Studios other cgi picture namely ""Ice Age"". What differentiate Robots from Ice Age is the pace within the movie where Robots unfortunately lacks the smooth pace that justified Ice Age reputation of being one of the best cgi animations ever made.The problem with Robots is that the pace besides the introduction to the characters in the beginning of the picture never seem to slowdown but keep a high and consistent pace which in the long run becomes a nuisance. A minor problem is the story which IMHO lacks the character sketching as compared to the duo of my all favorite animations animations (""The Lion King"", ""The Prince of Egypt"") e.g. where you can feel the gripping story after you've left the theater. I believe how ever that the relations between Cappy and Rodney Copperbottom is showing peculiar resemblance with the relationship between Del Spooner and Susan Calvin from ""I, Robot"" both of them released by 20th Century Fox Studios in the last year.The good news however is the cgi animation itself is outstanding (I saw it in a digital theater) as well as the humorous whims that the directors Chris Wedge & Carlos Saldanha have incorporated into the movie. Especially the casually ideas regarding ""Attack of the Clones"" are conspicuously equally but they provide a good laughter so there's no complains from me. In the end however I feel lackluster about recommending ""Robots"" because of the flaws described above so wait for the DVD, but if you're into animations then its worth seeing.7/10"
90,Robots,,5 April 2005,Never a dull moment...if you're a kid,"Most impressive are the action sequences, using the original idea of using pin-ball type sequences as a way of transportation. The movie is visually stunning, there's never a dull visual moment. My personal favorite is the dominoes sequence. That alone would make it worth a rental. Unfortunately, the visuals alone don't make up for an empty and boring story. The story is as hollow and mechanical as the characters. It really is too bad that most of these cartoon screenplay writers get away with being uninspired, obvious, and unfunny. Movies like this have the potential to appeal to adults as much as kids. This one does not. A wittier, funnier script might have made the difference. Normally I'm not a huge Robin Williams fan, but he saved this movie from being as bad as last years ""Shark Tale""."
91,Robots,,27 February 2005,Blue Sky/Fox Turns Out Another Robotic Animation Film for the Masses,"The studios are sure turning out computer animation films quickly because they can make a quick buck and get nominated for Oscars, no matter how good the films actually are. When a pop culture filled Shark Tale, with a cliché story line and little originality, can bring in $85 net profit during its theatrical release, receive a Best Animation Film Oscar nomination, then the studios must cash in on the trend because they can't lose.Unfortunately, Blue Sky Studios' (owned by Fox) new release Robots fits into this category of following the trend of little originality in storytelling. Robots is just a dry bland unfunny film, with a cliché storyline.Rodney Copperbottom must overcome the evil Phineas T. Ratchet, who's trying to take over a robot parts corporation. Of course Ratchet is all about making money and is pure evil. Along his journey, Rodney meets a couple girl bots, falls into a love triangle, and must rescue Big Weld, the great inventor.While there are some decent visuals, like when Rodney first arrives in Robot City, the story quickly becomes very robotic, and oddly unfunny. You know a children's movie is bad when the writers rely on fart jokes for laughs.This will probably garner an Oscar nomination next year when that time rolls around. It's amazing to me that a film like Shark Tale, and Shrek 2 for that matter, gets a nomination for Best Animation Film, while a very creative original dark story like The Polar Express gets overlooked. But then again, I guess that explains how Finding Nemo can win the Best Animation Oscar over The Triplets of Bellevillethe most creative and original animation film I've probably ever seen.The Oscars are a popularity contest, just like turning out films for the masses. Kids will flock to see Robots because they like to see the same thing over and over again. It's too bad the studios keep trying to copy the originality Pixar Animation brought to animation films with Toy Story, and keep on coming up with original entertaining films like The Incredibles."
92,Robots,2,14 March 2005,This film should have been scrapped.,"To get right down the nuts and bolts, the assembled cast was mechanical and failed to flesh out the potential in their characters.The plot is thin. The dialog is banal. Not a clever film. There was not enough thought put into this junk pile to make a full-length film. Scenes are drawn out to unbelievable lengths to fill time and kill brain cells. There really aren't any spoilers in this review. I can't bring myself to relive the boredom by relating details. It is too juvenile for adults, but the themes are too adult to be very entertaining for children. The farting was the best part; the best part stunk. Maybe I'm just getting to old to get lost in such nonsensical drivel, but it didn't make sense from the outset. Why robots? Where are the people? Why do robots eat? Why, why, why!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????? Hey, but wait, I don't care----it was dumb, dumb, dumb and I'm just grateful it is done, done,done. I give it two stars. I'm generous by nature."
93,Robots,3,17 January 2006,Heavy Metal Poisoning,"This scores a three only for the visual competence; Rube Goldberg meets a pinball machine, with the free-floating '3D' perspective. The jokes are funny for 10 yr. olds, we suppose. The creators are certainly among the mentally challenged. Witness the utterly crippled attempt to goof on HAL 9000.Otherwise, this borrows mostly from the Wizard of Oz. The derivations are from flash in the pan pop culture concerns, so expect a short shelf life.However, we have to confront the real reason for its existence, which of course, is to inculcate young minds with Hollywood/leftist flapdoodle.-- The benevolent elites 'invent things that make everyone's life better'. -- The small business owner is a cash register.-- The homeless man 'got screwed'.-- The corporation is ipso facto Evil; there's 'no money in concern'; offering products on the market involves 'making (us) feel crummy' so we need Upgrades. It must 'suck the last pennies' from customers'; if the bums can't pay they're just 'scrap metal'.-- No one can afford insurance (so the answer is to make it a birth right).Evidently, resources come from nowhere and can be distributed freely! Spare parts (money, health care/medication, insurance, etc.) are cheaper than what Evil Corp. pushes! They're just greedy...off with their heads!Folks, if you let this drivel influence a child's thinking, you deserve what you get. Ice Age contains similar noxious themes, surrounding predator/prey cooperation in nature.The leftist push for collectivism can't escape some hard facts...can you name one technological invention, one wonder drug, one cultural achievement that owes its origin to Socialism? No, because there are none. For Eisenstein and Tarkovsky to see, they had to stand on the shoulders of many non-communist giants, starting with Edison. It's leftism that belongs on the scrap heap..."
94,Robots,1,27 December 2005,This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.,"I have seen numerous bad movies over time, a result of a masochistic pleasure that my friends and I share in bashing horrid movies. I have seen The Final Stab, Cellular, Queen of the Damned, Jeepers Creepers, and Sleepover. And yet, despite all of this, Robots wins for the worst movie I have ever seen.Why is this? Why is this movie so bad that it ranks below Sleepover and The Final Stab? Simply because the aforementioned movies were all bad enough to be good. No matter how much they sucked, I managed to find some pleasure in watching them. Robots, on the other hand, was simply painful to watch, and elicited no pleasure whatsoever. The few jokes this movie possessed were either ripped from other movies and pop culture (a dying robot singing Daisy- what could have been a lovely joke, except that 1. It was ripping off a better movie and 2. The target audience has likely never heard of said better movie) or the yawn-inducing crude humor meant to impress modern five year olds who couldn't live without video games. Robin Williams added no amusement, as he tried yet again to reproduce the genius he managed to possess in Aladdin.Please, whatever you do, do not see this movie. It is painful to watch. Literally."
95,Robots,1,22 December 2005,"Trite, shallow, beyond PC safe and a waste of talent and film.","Absolutely awful. Don't say its for kids. A 9 and 6 year old had me turn it off when I got sick of it, and very lightly suggested we watch Toy Story or Monsters Inc. instead! Usually they say ""NOOOOO!"", but in this case, in unison, they said ""Yeah!!!!"". I will admit it was a good 10 - 15 minutes after the public transportation scene, which they did like, but yuck!!!!What a trite useless bit of un-entertaining fluff. I like ENTERTAINING fluff, but PC take no chances we don't want to offend anyone and use jokes and clichés that were old when Atok made his first comic cave drawing is a colossal waste. Everyone in the ""normal"" world of this movie smiling and low key but no true warm feelings or bonds are anywhere to be found. For example: Why was the father running around town disrupting everyone's life who were strangers just because he was having a baby? I live in a big city, but if I was having a baby, I KNOW all the vendors and store keepers on my path to work and would bask in their EARNED friendships, their daily lives that interact with mine- the countless relationships that everyone (who is human anyway) has in their daily life. While a stranger looking incrediuosly at the antics of another can be funny, as a rule, people shouldn't be used as mere props to somehow squeeze humor from a situation- unless you are a rich actor or movie executive who has no clue what life and real relationships are _really_ all about.Tell me, where in the film does it get fun? Or funny? With babysitting over, maybe I'll try to watch it again. Maybe I was in a bad ""mood"", but really, please, SOMEONE go to where they make this stuff and shake them up! Sorry, I'm ranting. But still...."
96,Robots,8,14 March 2005,a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy!,"We took our four year-old to see this movie and we all just loved it. It was funny and entertaining and I was really surprised that it had received such tepid reviews. Sure it had its share of ""potty"" humor and pop culture references, but this movie is geared towards children and I have to say that my daughter thought it was very funny. The visuals are just amazing and the story was amusing, but the message was one that I was glad that my daughter was exposed to. I would have to say that this movie was as good as other children's movies that have been released recently and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good movie to take the whole family to."
97,Robots,8,11 March 2005,Terrific,"Robots is a very entertaining movie. It has excellent visuals and the robots look like they are realistically rusted in addition to a lot of little detail you notice about watching this film. We follow the adventures of a young robot who goes to Robot City to follow his dreams as an inventor. Unfortunately, he finds out that Robot City is not quite what he imagined it would be. Along the way, he meets up with new friends, including a robot voiced by Robin Williams. Williams is very funny in this movie and it is great to have him doing an animated feature again. My only gripe about this film is the unnecessary bathroom humor like fart jokes that inappropriate for this film. Despite this complaint , I enjoyed this movie a great deal. 8/10"
98,Robots,1,12 April 2005,One of the worst of the year,"I wanted to see Sin City, instead, I saw Robots. I walked into the IMAX 10 minutes late, and there was no one there, the projector operator played the movie for me.That should have been an indication. I then sat there, through 2 hours of the most disappointing, basal crap that I have seen in a long time.Robin Williams can be funny, really really really funny, but then there is the 80% of the time that he is average, and then there is the 10% that is utter crap, this was all crap.The story sucked, the characters sucked, the whole idea was hugely lacking.I hope someone gets fired because of this movie."
99,Robots,10,12 March 2005,Enjoyable Film,"First off, the scrat is back. At the beginning of Robots you will get to see a short film featuring the scrat from Ice Age. I suspect this is to get your attention for Ice Age II.As to Robots, it was an enjoyable film and will get a 10 from me. I have a preference for Pixar films, and Robots does not have the plot you expect from Pixar, but the characters in Robots are likable, the voices are great, and the laughter and action will keep you entertained for the duration of the movie. There are so many references to past movies that you will need to see this one a few times to catch all of the references.Enjoy."
100,Robots,8,12 March 2005,Energetic and surprisingly well done,"From the same group that brought you Shark Tale comes the new CGI film  Robots, and it's obvious from the get-go that the same thinking went  into this film  much like Shark Tale, Robots masterfully creates a  semi-parodic world that is both funny, charming, and works on rules all  its own.  Robots is fast-paced and frenetic, moving its characters around a  metallic landscape both literally and figuratively, pulling some very  creative tricks out of its belt as it chugs along. The plot is fairly  straightforward and classic kiddie fare: young Rodney Copperbottom  (Ewan McGregor) leaves his loving suburban folks and moves to the Big  City (though not designed to look like NYC, it's patently obvious  that's the metaphor) to meet his idol, Mr. Bigweld (Mel Brooks) and  become an inventor who can help ordinary folks, just like Bigweld. Only  things are corroded in Robot City, and the once benign Bigwell  Industries has been taken over by the sleek autocrat Ratchet (Greg  Kinnear). When Rodney's initial attempt to impress Ratchet doesn't go  well, he is consigned to the depths of the city, and there he meets his  new down-and-out friends, obsolete models of robots dodging extinction  every day, led by Fender (Robin Williams).  But all of that takes only about fifteen minutes, and all along the way  we are treated to a visual barrage that is the optic equivalent of one  of Williams' comic rants, constantly and manically hopping from one  subject to another, pausing just long enough to let us get the joke  before leaping on to another topic. Robot City is one frightening but  hilarious landscape after another, and it's dizzying to watch Rodney  and Fender take the Crosstown Expressway. In fact at times there's  almost too much going on in the background (one guy selling bootleg CDs  reveals names like Britney Gears), and sometimes you're hard-pressed  merely to keep up with all the visual gags.  But Robots is dazzlingly clever. All of the characters are fun and  reasonably well-rounded for a movie like this, where character is often  almost completely ignored. From Rodney's earnest desire to help his  fellow robots to Fender's manic fear that he will be discarded to  Piper's (Amanda Bynes) pluckiness, the characters are both instantly  recognizable and instantly likable. Only the villains, Ratchet and his  mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent) are sketchily defined.  The voice acting is superb. McGregor is very enjoyable, and Williams  does his usual outstanding job. I felt Mel Brooks did a particularly  good job as the rotund Bigwell, and Bynes was excellent as well. Even  minor supporting characters were voiced very effectively.  The design work is nothing short of genius. In a world devoid of soft  fleshy organics like us, the robots have their own laws of physics, and  while there are many nods to our world in the designs (walking  mailboxes, dog robots looking to pee on fireplug robots, Ratchet wears  a metallic tie, etc.) the sheer creativity of design is almost  staggering. The look of the world ranges from the grungy to the  pedestrian to the sleek and shiny, but it never fails to engage and  delight. The characters likewise are all interesting and well-designed,  but also extremely easy to identify  which helps when the frantic  action starts.  Robots is very clever and very well done. It has nice messages for the  kids about believing in yourself, your dreams, and sticking with your  friends, as well as not valuing external looks too deeply; but a lot of  the jokes will cater more to the adults at times, so there's something  in it for everyone. Robots took me a little by surprise, it was so  good. This is one you definitely don't want to wait for the DVD with   it deserves to be seen on the big screen."
101,Robots,4,31 March 2005,"Lame. really, really lame.","I suppose I shouldn't have expected any more, but I did. The animation was good, sometimes really good, though not nearly as good as the pre-release hype built it up to be, but the story was weak. Really weak. Then there were the truly insipid and lame jokes (fart jokes? why would ROBOTS even understand fart jokes. That sort of humor was very distracting. And those may have been the high points of the script. The cast worked hard with it, tried to give it some sort of freshness, but the script was so weak and dated that it just never had a prayer. The material was old and tired, and the sight gags were even older (did they resurrect Moe Howard to choreograph). All in all, I was bored and disappointed in this movie and hope to never see its like again."
102,Robots,10,12 March 2005,A film for kids of all ages,"I just took my 6 year old to see this and I'm going to approach this review from the experience we had in the cinema. You can watch trailer and read the plot & cast list elsewhere and even in-depth analyses.First of all this is a film for KIDS. The plot is aimed squarely at them so it is simplistic. It has to be. Anything too complex and kids will get lost.Anyway, my son and I laughed like drains through the whole film and so did the rest of the audience. There are some nice gags for adults in there including fleeting references to other films. Star Wars is an obvious one but there is a lovely reference to 2001:A Space Odessey - see if you spot it. Some of the gags are lightening fast - e.g. a robot gets belted just as he walks out the upgrade shops and his upgrades are knocked off and land on another. This robot strikes an heroic pose and there is a single chord form the Halleuiah Chorus! Blink and you miss it.One of the best gags for adults is a the beginning when Rodney is being built, you'll know when you see it as I called out ""I WANT one of those!"" and all the other adults agreed! Some of the humour is basic but sooo funny. The Farting scene is painfully funny, I thought I was going to fall off my chair. The bit where the lamp-post falls to his knees gasping for air is a killer and the icing is when the scene shifts to the next day and there is a chalk outline! It has lovely imagery and characters and for the British audience it's nice when Terry Wogan(!) gets a cameo voice over.I'll sum it up by saying that as we left the theatre I said ""I want to see it again"" and my 6-year old was bouncing up and down asking if we could get the DVD.As far as I'm concerned if I take my son to a film, he sits through the WHOLE thing without leaving his seat ONCE and then asks for more then the movie makers get a 9 out of 10. if I've enjoyed it they get a 10.This movie scores an 11 :)"
103,Robots,,11 March 2005,"OK at best,  no Magic","I thought this movie was OK at best. It never one time had the magic of ANY Pixar film or even it's own studios ""Ice Age."" I felt like the entire beginning sequence of ""Rivet Town"" or wherever they lived was a complete ripoff of the beginning scenes of ""Finding Nemo"" and the choral reef. Then, the ""Big City"" scene was a complete rip-off of the Trailer trash scene of city bugs in a ""Bug's Life."" The underlying theme was a rip-off of your choice of many movies. As a matter of fact, there was not an original thought in this entire movie. Even Robin Williams robot was just the Genie in a different form. The best part of the movie was the preview for Star Wars Episode 3. 2nd best was the Scrat sneak peak. Parts of this movie dragged soooo much, that when a ""funny"" part came, you forget to laugh cuz you're zoned out. Kids will like it, but it doesn't have Magic of most CGI films to keep adults entertained. I will say one thing though, it's a lot better than Shrek 2!"
104,Robots,9,11 March 2005,A wonderful family movie!,"While many reviews of Robots have focused on the weak storyline, I would like to point out that it is a children's movie. While there is plenty in it to keep an adult's interest (look for all the signs around the city), the story is simple enough that my 5 year old understood exactly what it was about: be true to your dreams.The level of detail in the movie is staggering. It's obvious the software used to create and render the animation has evolved quickly since Ice Age. Some of the scenes in the city (especially the public transportation system) are incredible blends of imagination and technical achievement.The voice work is wonderful. Rather than make the same mistake Shark Tale did, Robots has wisely used the talent to enrich the movie rather than *become* the movie. People don't want to see celebrities in an animated movie. They want to see characters with recognizable voices that are still characters. And in this, Robots excels. The number of cameo voices is amazing, and unless you watch the entire credit list, I doubt anyone will be able to pick them all out.If you're looking for an enjoyable family outing, one with a great moral for your children, and a truly entertaining way for adults to spend time, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Robots!"
105,Robots,,19 January 2006,"Mechanical, Manufactured and Uninspired","It's fittingly mechanical. A downtrodden but idealistic hero follows his dream to be all he can be and triumphs against adversity thanks to the help of his faithful-but-quirky chums. Ho-hum. Of course the central moral message concerning self-image  our hero tries to persuade his chums that they shouldn't feel ashamed because they are old, broken or unfashionable  is laid on thicker than industrial-strength lube, and is ever-so-slightly undermined by the knowledge that some savvy producer probably spent long grasping hours cajoling designers into fashioning exactly the right look of robot to best adorn the shelves of Toys-R-Us.It's not without its charms. Film references abound  from 'cameos' by the Tin-Man to a stunned robot singing 'Daisy, Daisy' (a la HAL) while being reprogrammed. Sudden bits of 'business', including an unexpected Britney sample, also draw a smile. Generally, though, the humour falls into two categories: elaborate slapstick (which becomes repetitive and a little tiresome) and toilet humour, of which there is an astonishing amount. I don't include fart-gags in this - fart gags are always good for a chortle in kids' flicks, after all  but, given their target audience, the humour is rather misjudged at times. It lacks the wit of recent cross-generational hits 'Shrek' or 'Finding Nemo', but is, thankfully, a little more sophisticated than the dire 'A Shark's Tale'.As for the performances Well, had I not known that Ewan MacGregor, Halle Berry, Stanley Tucci and the like were in the cast, I would have been hard-pressed to identify them. Vocal characterisation in animation is bloody difficult, and, as is often the case in animation, the villains are best served  here by Lowell Ganz as the greedy 'Gasket', and the sublime Jim Broadbent as his mother. These parts attract character actors who can adapt more readily to such a medium. Heroes are 'stars' (sic), who may have on physical appeal or presence on screen but have lesswelltalent in other areas. Berry is bland as Hell (though better than her most recent outings in 'Gothica' and the accursed 'Catwoman', and MacGregor fares little better. Mel Brooks is passably avuncular as 'Mister Bigweld', but has little time to develop his characterisation, and relative unknown Amanda Byrnes makes a splendidly spunky 'Piper'.Then, inevitably, there's Robin Williams. The Antichrist of Sentimentality, Williams thankfully doesn't have to do any emoting in 'Robots'  for which we must be grateful. He tries harder than any of his cast-mates  save, perhaps, Broadbent and Byrnes  to create a memorable character, but is re-treading ground already trodden by his anarchic Genie in 'Aladdin'. This is a great shame, as Williams has a great voice  he possesses an astonishing vocal range  but resorts more often than not to Groucho-style patter and SHOUTING. Not entirely his fault, of course. As Terry Gilliam proved in 'The Fisher King', he can be anarchic and act if reigned in by a capable director. Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha may be capable technicians  fusing the multiplicity spectacular visual effects which are, really, the only reason why anyone over the age of eight should see this film, but they clearly don't know the nuts and bolts of getting good performances from a living, breathing cast of actors."
106,Robots,,14 September 2017,nice,"a charming film. for the fine mix between love/friendship story, war against evil, good animation and humor. for the heroism and jokes , delicate irony and the few touching scenes. an animation about values, using possibilities of a magnificent art for give the entrance to a lovely, surprising, well known world, not original but different, seductive and full of admirable craft measure. short, a good refuge for entertainment. few great scenes, interesting characters and adorable adventures.almost an old fashion film."
107,Robots,7,15 February 2017,Pretty great,"This film great for the most part. It has great CGI and great voice-casting. The people who animated this film really payed attention and made it look very detailed, and this film has a great voice cast. I will be honest and say that the story is not great, but it's not bad either. It's pretty good, just nothing too fantastic about it. The reason why is because it's pretty generic. I say that because it's the old ""Stop the villain and everything gets better"" cliché. They do that very well in this movie, but it's just that I've seen this happen many times in other films, and it doesn't really impress me all that much. But I guess it's good enough to sit through, I guess. There are a few times in which this film can seem a little overly kiddie. But other than that, I enjoyed this film and would recommend this to anyone who likes robots or anyone else really. I can't guarantee everyone would love this film the first time they see it, but they'll most likely have fond feelings for this film like I still do."
108,Robots,9,20 August 2014,A lot going on!,"Really well-done FAMILY flick that will entertain young kids to tweens, as well as the adults in the room. The film is visually captivating, with a lot of interactions going on in the background, a positive story and a really well-written script that will entertain many different audiences. It was released in 2005, and seems to have aged well, more so than a film like Antz or even A Bug's Life.Overall, this movie is entertaining with a fun, scientific edge, a fun mechanical look, and an overall positive experience throughout the film. Surprisingly, this movie has not received the same reverence as other animated films released around the same time."
109,Robots,7,11 June 2014,Don't be fooled by the movie poster; the animation is much vivider and livelier than it looks.,"Robots (2005) is a visually pleasing and entertaining film. It is quite artsy but generally robots and androids lovers will like this! It sets in an entirely mechanical world, where each and every robot is unique in their own ways. This film, the second by Blue Sky Studios is certainly way way way finer than the first Ice Age film. They should have been rewarded a most improved studio kind of award!I loved the concept and visuals, it is quite entertaining to watch as a whole as it is mechanically gorgeous but in terms of story and character creations, it is a little...lacking. For example, I did not know there was a specific love interest for the main character until I read up on it cause I don't see any obvious chemistry or hint. *lol* Nonetheless, the film does have an inspiring message and there are some scenes in the film that left me dumbfounded; their version of baby making is hilarious and the fast paced Robot City's cross town express is surely epic. Hence, don't be fooled by the movie poster; the animation is much vivider and livelier than it looks. At first I thought it might be boring but boy, I was wrong!"
110,Robots,8,14 April 2013,Rodney's went to big city and Rodney be disappointed.,"I wanted to go to a film whose name is Robots. But I didn't go to cinema so I didn't watch the film. According to what I have heard the film is excellent. After I had thought about the film, I wanted to go to cinema. And next day I watched the film. After I had watched the film , I liked it. Especially my favourite characters are Rodney and Fender. Because they are very funny. But I didn't like one part of the film. This part of the film is about real life and artificial life . But I still like the film. Robots is the best comedy and child film on the world. The most beautiful part is that Rodney spokes to rusty and foreign robots. Briefly I liked the film."
111,Robots,5,21 January 2013,A Bit Rusty...,"When computer animated films were first birthed, a lot of the first ones were brilliant. The people behind them worked as hard on the scripts as the effects, and so we got masterpieces such as Toy Story, Shrek, A Bugs Life... (Stop laughing at the back).So when did the rot set in? When did CGI flicks stop being events, and become just another way to print money? My vote is for the mid 00's, when rather than around 2 a year, studios started releasing around 10. They stopped with the heartfelt stories and the clever humour, and instead gave us obnoxious characters, unoriginal plots and bathroom gags aplenty. Mostly, companies that weren't Pixar. A few examples: A Shark Tale, The Ant Bully, and this loud nonsense, which is as soulless as its mechanical protagonists.Ewen Mcgregor and a whole cast of stars do voiceovers, but their presence neither adds nor subtracts anything to the film. As for Robin Williams, he's like a prescription medicine: Good in small doses, but too much and you begin to feel a bit queasy. It's just utterly forgettable, and has deservably consigned to the scrapheap in most people's memories (Tee Hee). The funny thing is, I remember liking it a lot more when I saw it at the cinema initially. Oh well, my critical faculties must have been a bit below par that day..."
112,Robots,,24 September 2012,David Bogars Review,"My son absolutely loves this movie! Its great and its not a drag like some children's movies for adults to watch. My son is 5, I think this is his favorite movie! Chris wedge did a great job creating this story plot. You can see the creative input from William Joyce as well. It also stars Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Robin Williams, and Mel Brooks. The film is very unique as well for being a kids movie. I would highly recommend this to add to any family movie night like we do at home. As far as a movie about anthropomorphic robots is concerned, its a great story. I love that robin williams is the broken old red robot. Mel Brooks is a great voice for Bigweld. ~ David Bogar"
113,Robots,10,3 May 2012,"Good story, good animation, fun to watch","I gave it a 10:Story is original but not to difficult to understand for a child, it has it all, not wealthy family, living and following your dreams, taking action for what you want to achieve. Of course sometimes predictable, but then, this is very entertaining for a child. - Animation is nicely done, still detailed to date, by then is had to be amazing. - animation casting very nicely done, a lot of creation to makeup all different robots (more difficult then creating from nothing different cars...) - Voices are great done, very good actually.And indeed (as for 3-may-2012), the average score of 6.2 is not on par with this movie. My personal opinion, it should be more likely +8.0"
114,Robots,,23 February 2009,Very entertaining CGI film. Brilliant animation,"This is a very enjoyable CGI animated feature. The story is simple but the animation quality is astounding. It's probably the best use of animation in a non-Dreamworks, non-Pixar film produced by a US studio. The color palette is fascinating and several sequences are jaw-dropping. There are numerous sight gags and the film is packed with visual references to other films. The voice work is alright with Robin Williams and Jim Broadbent standing out. There are a few unnecessary jokes that will only appeal to those under fourteen, but the rest of the film is great fun.Overall 8/10"
115,Robots,7,30 May 2007,"""Why be you when you can be new.""","I guess one of the advantages of having a two year old grandson is getting to watch movies I wouldn't ordinarily consider viewing. That happened today with ""Robots"", and it wasn't altogether a bad experience, particularly in light of some of the reviews on this site bashing the film. Those claiming it's the worst they've ever seen, I'm convinced, haven't seen more than a couple years worth of new releases. Try watching a couple thousand for some perspective and you'll find that this is about average for story telling, and much better for animated visual effects. Now I'm not speaking from the perspective of having seen all of the great animated features of the last ten years or so, because I haven't. But there's a lesson here, a theme done dozens of times before in film, whether it's called old vs. new, young vs. old, or spare parts vs. upgrades. If you can't tell, I fall on the side of good old fashioned conventional values, because ultimately, character counts. And to show you I can put my money where my mouth is, I once worked for a company with a Ratchet for it's President - I left.Best sequence of the story - the Rube Goldberg ride into Robot City.The best visual gag - the 'got screwed' panhandler.

116,Robots,7,22 April 2007,"All In All, This Was Heartwarming, If Only Mildly So.","Let me start off by saying I like this movie, and I own it. But to break it down, I like it more because it features Mel Brooks's voice than any other reason. The work itself is enjoyable, does teach a moral lesson, and entertains via Robin Williams, but Robin was only the comedic relief, and Mel Brooks's character was nothing but a strong supporting character.The moral lesson is to follow your dream; a lesson I like to see going out to our children. It is an often used message, but I still don't think they hear it enough.The star voice belongs to Michael J. Fox, who seemed to be the only one besides Brooks to get into their characters and really give them some sense of life. Otherwise, the voices are a bit lackluster, probably due to the lack of real material into which they could actually sink their teeth (or emotional investment). However, the finished product is still enjoyable.All in all, this was heartwarming, if only mildly so, and is still worth the time to view it.It rates a 6.9/10 from...the Fiend :."
117,Robots,7,21 April 2005,"Just a nice, meaningful, entertaining film..... BUT....","Basically... we can see that the theme and a slogan for the company - ""u can shine no matter what u r made of"" for the word ""made of""... I'm fascinated that they use robots to symbolise it as a technique....the whole story is predictable... but very meaningful.... the jokes they use which related a little to ""sex"", like..""I'm embarrassed when that thing drop of me"", etc. is not very suitable for kids while this film caught kids attention... anyway, the sense of humour did not appear to be very ridiculous like Mr. Beans(I don't like jokes which r too silly and ridiculous).. and I laughed all the way...What I can say good about this film - endless...But wait... y I just give 7/10....strictly saying...the theme : u can shine no matter what u r made of or the determination towards ur dreams....If they say ""u can shine no matter what u r made of""... well.. i think... we should really see how they shine..... the characteristics of the characters are not strong... well u can see the ""upgraded"" version shone in a humorous way while they fought against the ""psycho mama""... but still, it's not persuasive enough that they had shone(exp. the bot with big wheels)... well, the point is good... U can ""upgrade""(shine) as long u want to... ##the contarst between copperbottom and the supporting parts(which r not outstanding enough) can affect ppl(who r normal) to think that we r just normal and not as talented as copperbottom - this film had failed to express the theme.... come to logical sense... Just consider that robots can give birth robotically and grow robotically.... while commen sense tells... how robots have babies...Great person like bigweld will not be affected by small matters.... don't u feel he gave up over small matters....?? I cannot ""feel"" the theme.... I can only see it.... so, strictly, the psychological effect for the theme is not strong...well... now this whole thing looks like the movie"" country boy make it in town "".... so, the storyline is not very ""fresh""... too much concentration on how the main character shines and forgets the rest....##but one part is very good.... the film makes me feel not to give up in dreams(when copperbottom calls his father).... this is the best psychological effect on me... if so... the theme about determination(which u can't see anyone in the film mentioning) had been successfully told....... in conclusion, this film is still worth a watch..."
118,Robots,,11 April 2005,Great Fun!,"I came expecting a lot, and was not disappointed. This is what good movie-making is all about. I will see it again! The visuals were strong. The story was what great story telling is all about. And the voice talent was remarkable!!! Every bit as good as Ice Age. I am an independent animator, so I tend to be a harsh critic. But, this did not disappoint. Like its predecessor there was clever humor littered throughout, so as an adult, I thought it was funny. Kids should enjoy it too. This is family fun for all ages. It will be interesting to see if it has legs. I expect this movie to last throughout the spring. I will buy this when it comes out on DVD."
119,Robots,,10 April 2005,"""Robots"" isn't a clunker, but a bit more fine-tuning would have helped.","If ""Futurama""'s New New York or Bubbletown from ""Cubix"" had cinemas catering to robots, ""Robots"" would certainly be playing there. It isn't quite in the same league as ""Ice Age"" - it certainly doesn't look as if it's as worthy of repeat viewings, but that doesn't make it down there with ""Shark Tale""; this movie at least has a proper script and some actual humour, plus some halfway decent characters, even if they aren't the most original ones.Blue Sky Studios' animation has improved; the movie's never less than fine to look at with its impressive designs and movements, and apart from Halle Berry as the closest thing to a love interest, the voice cast is a plus (although some of the substitutions on the UK release version are a distraction, particularly Terry Wogan as the voice of the villain's father - on the other hand, Cat Deeley is more...er...worthy of being thrown away than Natasha Lyonne, let's leave it at that); Jim Broadbent as the villain's mother (!), Paul Giamatti as Bigweld's guard, Greg Kinnear as the villain, Amanda Bynes as Piper (""Rhymes with 'viper'"") and yes, Robin Williams as Fender (rhymes with Bender... and there is a robot with a distinct bottom reference) in particular deserve a bow.What doesn't work quite so well is the attempt to find a good balance between comedy and sentimentality; the script could have been a bit more subtle in its ""You don't have to be new to be good"" and ""To thine own self be true"" messages, worthy morals though they are. The movie's fondness for some groaner jokes - like ""Bicentennial Man,"" it even works in a joke about flatulent robots (""We were using our ARMS!!!"" wails Piper when Aunt Fan takes it to the ultimate) - and a battle climax that somehow doesn't fire on all cylinders as it should also reduce the overall effect; it's entertaining, but it doesn't carry much emotional weight, not helped by John Powell's uneven score.On the other hand, it doesn't carry much emotional weight, but it IS entertaining - the obligatory references to other movies etc manage to not outweigh the plot (although having Fender beat up villains to Britney's ""(Hit Me) Baby One More Time"" was a mistake), it's got plenty of energy and humour, and it winds up a good and heartening tale... even if it's not on the level of Pixar. What it lacks in invention in its storyline it makes up for with good intentions and spirit; I would love it if major American studios could do some more action-adventure based animation features along with (not instead of) family-intended movies, rather than letting Japan have that territory all to itself, but at least they're making good ones.One thing though; the Melanie Blatt song tacked onto the UK release print is not only an obvious tack-on (and gruesomely out of place - both musically and because the song finishes before the end credits do!) but not a patch on the theme for ""Cubix."" Come on, some of you have to know it - ""In the future not too far away, it's the dawning of an all new day/Robots for everyone/Machines that care can be our friend, side by side until the end/Robots for everyone..."""
120,Robots,,10 April 2005,Entertaining but forgettable,"Young Rodney Copperbottom dreams of making it big in the big city and making his humble parents proud. That tells viewers what to expect from Robots, a movie that entertains but leaves no lasting impression. Unfortunately the story - spunky young hero teams up with wacky sidekick to take on evil- is so familiar that impatient viewers will predict events long before they happen. With the exception of always-reliable Robin Williams, the acting is only adequate. However, the dull plot and characters are offset by intricate artwork and a generous dose of humour, and the movie is enjoyable if not memorable.Ample visual gags, wisecracks and winking movie references (from 2001 to Scarface) provide genuine laughs. The visual design, especially the bustling Robot City, is well constructed and worth a few minutes of open-mouthed amazement. Overall Robots is fine family viewing, although a few scenes are too dark for sensitive young children **SPOILER (I am thinking of the chop shop and especially the fate of the Gasket family) END SPOILER** The ""bad guys hatch dastardly plan"" scene subtly echoes sci-fi films such as Soylent Green (the bodies of ""Outmodes"" are recycled for the next generation)and Gattaca (idealistic outsider and jaded outsider team up to outwit system). An ad campaign titled ""Why be you, when you can be new?"" aims to send robots rushing out to buy new upgrades, when the only alternative is to become scrap metal. Advertisers have long preyed on our insecurities about our bodies, and I was disappointed to see this theme raised but then ignored: Who will be left behind if opportunity exists only for the flawless?"
121,Robots,,10 April 2005,More of the Same,"Great visuals and transport scenes. Good key character development. Overused story - son proving to his father how great he can be. Now where have I seen this story line before ? Why doesn't the son do something different from the parent and still ultimately get parental approval ? ! Now that would be rocking the boat... and not so satisfactory to the parents of the world !Do kid's films just have to be about Good triumphing over Evil ? Why don't we put some ethical dilemmas that kids are intelligent enough to tackle. Kids want real action...mental dilemmas that the world they suspect is full of. How about a bit less of the not-so ""live happily ever after endings."" It might meet with less approval from parents but it would be a stand out film. So what flavour have we got this week ? ""Vanilla"" But didn't we have thatlast week ? ""That was a different version"" Oh...OK."
122,Robots,,9 April 2005,"Big voices, animated garbage","I'm sitting here and wondering how hard I should come down on this movie. I mean, it is a kids movie and I am not really a kid. On the other hand I loved movies like ""Shrek"" and ""Shark Tale"". Well, lets start by saying that we had some big actors doing the voices. That is good I guess. But if we say for a second that this really is just a kids movie, do they care who does the voices in that case? So, that isn't important? It is a good story anyhow. If it wasn't about robots you could almost think it was a nice little story by Disney. I especially like the little touch that the robots don't grow old, you have to replace their parts. So when the little kid in this movie grown up, the parents bring him new bigger parts to use.Well, the kid grows up. Ehm, I mean, gets rebuilt a few times. And then goes to the big city to become an inventor. Well, nice nice.... we all know it will end very happily, it is a kids movie. But, I enjoyed watching it and the animations are really good. But not groundbreaking good."
123,Robots,,5 April 2005,Happy Jumpy Fun,"After just sitting through ""Shark Tale"", I wasn't much looking forward to ""Robots"". ""Shark Tale"" was an unimaginative loud star studded mess. ""Robots"" works because some imagination did go into making this. A cool world is created where all the images are robotic and all the characters are robots of some kind. It was cool just watching some of the imagery and you can tell some thought went into this.The basic story has a young naive inventor leaving his home to the big city to try and sell a big corporation his invention. He meets some friends and rejects and of course falls in love along the way as he battles the crooked corporation led by an evil second in command.""Robots"" is cute. It's a happy film with many pratfalls and sight gags that most people will like and a cool world is created. It's not a great movie, but I think it works well enough. (***)"
124,Robots,,2 April 2005,Robots - Between laughing and sleeping,"Well, first a great thank-you to the animators of the Blue Sky Studios, who have done an amazing job. The town, were the movie takes place is very detailed and looks amazing. Just as the Robots... Indeed you miss the charm of a cute Nemo or Dorie of the Pixar Animations Studio, but the story of Rodney is as good as interesting. But as a spectator you sometimes don't know if you should laugh or be bored of that, whats going on the screen. Some gags are well, some aren't and when the movie went along you feel that something was missing.A good animation movie for a bored weekend but not as good as a Pixar or a Dreamworks movie. I'm looking forward to ""Shrek 2""."
125,Robots,7,2 April 2005,"Not bad, but not great","Robots is not as good as many, including myself, thought it would be after seeing the commercials. It is, however, very well done in the animation department. The voice acting is also well done as the movie has a rather good cast. There are scenes that could almost be considered spoofs of other films, but if you are only paying casual attention, you are likely to miss quite a few of them. Since Robots is from the same company as Ice Age, I expected it to be at least as good as that, much like Pixar's movies get consistently better, but Robots didn't live up to that. In the end, Robots is a well done animated film that has more clever moments than funny moments and is worth seeing if you need either a family friendly film or if you really enjoy this type of animated film."
126,Robots,7,1 April 2005,A Mechanical Marvel,"Robots is a worthy successor to Blue Sky Studio's first full-length CGI film, 2002's Ice Age. While they haven't quite mastered Pixar Studio's superior integration of story, innovation and stunning visual imagery, they are coming pretty close. The film itself looks great and there's no doubt that a great deal of imagination went into creating this unique world of robots. The only lacking element is the script, which at times tries too hard to be clever, sacrificing story in the process.Robots involves a world entirely populated by robots. There is no hint that humans were ever present, although it is obvious that these robots share many human characteristics. They eat, fart (don't ask), and even have children. Of course their kids aren't so much birthed as they are assembled. In this case, it is the arrival of baby Rodney, to Mr. and Mrs. Herb Copperbottom, that sets the story in motion. Rodney, seen growing up through a series of hand-me-down upgrades, proves to be a clever inventor.Once he graduates from high school, Rodney, played energetically by Ewan MacGregor, is determined to seek his fortune by leaving small Rivet Town for the sophisticated digs of Robot City. There he intends to meet Bigweld (Mel Brooks), a Walt Disney/Wizard of Oz type character who has inspired millions through his long-running TV show. Rodney's plans go immediately awry, however, when he discovers that the evil Mr. Gasket (Greg Kinnear), and not Bigweld, is really in charge.In his struggle to match his dreams, Rodney makes friends with a number of run-down, older model robots who have suffered due to Gasket's actions. Gasket, under the watchful eye of his horrid mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), wants to eliminate all replacement parts and only provide expensive upgrades, which few robots can afford. Some of the robots that Rodney befriends are Fender (Robin Williams), Piper (Amanda Bynes), and Crank (Drew Carey). He also establishes a possible romantic relationship with Cappy (Halle Berry), a sympathetic executive in Gasket's corporation.The robots in this film have a definite retro look, appearing as if they were designed by forward looking engineers from the 30's and 40's. They are also brightly colored, making use of all of the primary colors that we are comfortable with. Even the newer, shiny models have an old-fashioned look that helps elevate the essential charm of this film.There are a number of stunning visual sequences in this film which can take your breath away. Three, in particular, are worth mentioning. Early in the film, Rodney takes a ride on Robot City's public transportation system. It actually turns into a gigantic game of Mousetrap, designed more for fright than efficiency, but it does get the job done. In another sequence, Rodney becomes magnetized, requiring him to outrun a number of metallic objects which threaten to crush or damage him. And, finally, there's a chase sequence near the end of the film that matches the best of similar scenes in any of the Star Wars films.Although the film sports a large, all-star cast, no one really distinguishes themselves, including the usually reliable Robin Williams. His stream-of-consciousness shtick just doesn't work as well here as it did when he played the genie in Disney's Aladdin. Sometimes he needs to be reigned in and this is one of those occasions. The writers, also, try too hard at various points in the film. For example, there is a scene where Fender turns into a Britney Spears clone, accompanied by stage-like dancers. Admittedly the scene is entertaining and funny, but it is totally out-of-context with everything else that is happening at that moment. I did enjoy some of the numerous visual puns, however. Especially the signs identifying the respective bathrooms - a wall socket and an electric plug.Despite some minor reservations, I think this is a wonderful and entertaining film that almost matches the best work from Pixar studios, which isn't feint praise.My Grade: B+"
127,Robots,,30 March 2005,English Version,"In the English version Aunt Fanny, is substituted for Aunt Fan, as Fanny is an offencive word in the UK. When seeing the film for the second time, back in the United Kingdom, the section in Robots, when Fender invites Rodney back to his aunts the flow is somewhat lost in the UK version, as there is no comedic connection between Aunt Fan, and Aunt Booty. It never ceases to amaze me how Hollywood still uses a word that only Americans use to describe one's backside. Also, Lorretta Geargrinder's Voice is Cat Deeley in the UK Version.I found this to be important, as I found out that IMDb does not even recognise Cat Deeley as even being in Robots."
128,Robots,,30 March 2005,"Okay, but overall disappointing.","""Robots"" is the second film from the people who created ""Ice Age"". Before I go on with this review, can I just say that if any of you have not watched ""Ice Age"", then you should! It's a quality film, with some very funny lines and scenes in it. Having said that, you can understand my disappointment when I went to see ""Robots"".It's the story of Rodney Copperbottom, (Voiced by an almost unrecognisable Ewan McGregor), a inventor robot who dreams of one day making it big in Robot City, and working for Big Weld (Mel Brooks). His hopes are dashed when he discovers that Big Weld's company has been taken over by a smart, smooth-talking robot named Ratchet (Greg Kinear) who, along with his horrible mother, Mrs Gasket (Jim Broadbent-can you believe it? Jim Broadbent!) wants to get rid of all the robots who are, in their eyes, ""out-modes"". Rodney joins a group of these so called out-modes, led by Fender (Robin Williams)- a robot who is literally falling apart - to fight Ratchet, his mom, and rescue Big Weld from being melted down and turned into something new.The storyline is pretty good, and even as I write it down I can see how good a movie this would make. However there are some major drawbacks. The first of these is that the film is very slow at getting off the ground. There are one or two laughs, but not as many as you would expect from a movie set in a world of robots. Time and time again I found myself thinking back to the opening moments of ""Ice Age"". Of course, to be fair, it is not good to compare these two films - they are both so different - but I just couldn't help it!The second problem is Robin Williams. Actually, scratch that. He is not a problem himself. In fact, Robin Williams is the best thing in this movie. He gives it a good kick up the backside, and the screen feels empty without him. The problem is his script. I went in with memories of his similar performance in ""Aladdin"", but it seems that the director didn't want any ad-libbing this time. To them I say this: YOU FOOLS! LOOK WHAT YOU COULD HAVE CREATED! Ahem.""Ice Age"" had four main characters - the mammoth, sloth, tiger and squirrel-rat thingy. This movie has too many characters. You don't feel for anything about these characters. The romance that is supposed to happen between Halle Berry's character and Rodney is not believable because she has so little screen time. In my view it would have been better to have got Rodney together with Fender's sister, Piper, (Amanda Byrne - another good thing about this movie), who obviously had the hots for him.""Ice Age"" was a good film to watch with your family. In that film there were plenty of laughs for both kid an grown-up alike. ""Robots"" seems to have been written largely for the kids. This is where it fails most of all. Fart jokes aside, there was nothing really for the adult audience to really laugh at. Perhaps this is because Robin Williams stuck to the script this time, unlike in ""Aladdin"", where he made comments that I didn't understand when I first saw it, but my parents sure did.Visually, the film is good. However, with more and more CGI films coming out, what I think studios are trying to do is create bigger and better films visually. This does not always provide good entertainment. Sure, it's a sight to see when we first view Robot City for the first time, but after a while it gets boring. Because of this the studios and directors of CGI films need to concentrate way more time on the scripts, and less on the visual spectacle of the film.Oh, and by the way, any readers of this from England, Terry Wogan plays Ratchet's dad. Terry Wogan! That's either inspired or downright surreal!4/10"
129,Robots,,28 March 2005,Byoki desu Domo Arigato Mr Roboto,"Easter holidays, nothing to do but see a movie. We checked the cinema guide, Be Cool, Don't wanna see that. Ring 2, Nah, I read it was a cash-in sequel. Robots? Hmm. That might be fun. Nope.As I watched the laughter of young children filled the cinema, yet I'm a teenager and I found this movie quite uninspired. Yes, it does too many big named stars in it to bring the viewers in , and it did have one or two adult tipped jokes to keep them at bay. But in reality it's nothing new. Just like Monster's inc (and to a lesser extent it's predecessor Ice Age) it makes those jokes which compare the movies civilisation to the human mass. Yet, there was nothing new in these jokes. They only struck a cord of unoriginality. Like 'Shark Tale', it pumped out 'them young person' tunes like Britney Spears and Nelly, call me a realist or a perfectionist if you will, but Robots would not listen to this music. Too many movies are trying to be human. They are trying to be humans in different skins. Shark Tale was New York underwater only with freakier looking characters, Shrek Two was Los Angeles with freakier looking characters, and this too is another human with different skins romp, only this time it's robots and their mass transport services are powered with some kind of kinetic mechanical engineering. I hate to be like everyone else and praise 'Finding Nemo' and the other Pixar/Disney movies, but in admitted truth they remain (at least at the time of writing) the masters of the genre. Finding Nemo had it's human moments, but the bulk majority presented them as what they were - talking fish. Even Madagascar, which at the time of writing has not be released looks to humany, it's a frickin' cartoon. Let loose.On another note, Robin Williams really was dragged down by the substandard writing. Why didn't they unleash his full potential.Such is life I guess, I only hope Ice Age 2 can make a better statement."
130,Robots,6,28 March 2005,Minor Mechanical Failure,"Not really a failure, just more like an error. The Ice Age short before the movie was 10 times more hysterical than the feature itself. Many of the adult jokes were funny, some just wrong. I felt Fender's (Williams) jokes were just being forced during the whole movie. Independently, they were funny, but most of them just slowed the picture down and were out of place. And though Robot City was marvelous, most of the movie was spent exploring the set than giving their character's 3 dimensions. It's too bad that the big names were only for filling seats in a theater, not adding dimension to the story. Overall, the movie felt very rushed in creating the marvelous and potentially great plots people have just come to expect from a CGI film (go Pixar!). None the less, kids will enjoy it, parents will bare it and hopefully next time, 20th Century Fox will work up something better."
131,Robots,,28 March 2005,"disappointing, but funny","Well, I think the best strengths of this film were: Dazzling animation effects. Robot City was a marvel to behold The humor was funny.Other than that, I'm afraid this film is a sort of dismal affair. The kids will love it, but it lacks any real redeeming value for older crowds. The movie is a lineup of all the clichés Hollywood keeps in storage. One cliché after another, with no logic, setup, or Heart to it. By the last fifteen minutes, I'm shaking my head because it just goes from one formula moment to the next, and the character voices are simply accommodating the clichés.Tries to be something like Toy Story or Incredibles with the aged ""Out with the old, in with the new"" situation themes, but without any buildup or chemistry. Big name voices and no chemistry. None. Ewan and Halle supposedly hookup for no reason, Mel Brook's character tells Ewan to beat it one moment, then inexplicably turns around and says ""I'm with you all the way"". Everything is wrapped up nicely in the end without any Heart. Ewan and Robin carry the film sort of, Ewan playing it straight and goody-goody, Robin being slapstick wacky, etc.Don't get me wrong. I laughed a lot. It IS a funny movie, but a forgettable one. It just feels like somebody just wanted to go by the numbers really quick. Worth watching once."
132,Robots,,28 March 2005,"not bad, not bad at all","hmmm I've read other comments and have to ask, how old are these critics? Robots is a fun, funny movie, so what children love farts hell i love farts, everyone does em, whats the big deal, i prefer my children watching fart jokes as opposed to sexual innuendo that so many children's movies are laced with (Shrek). There is definitely a plot its really thin but with the attention span of children they don't really care too much about plots. I quite enjoyed this movie so did my kids. If your looking for something with a thick leather-bound plot then look elsewhere, if you can get past that then this is just what your after its fun, colorful, littered with jokes we all know and its simple storytelling thats not too shabby. All in All not too bad at all :)"
133,Robots,,22 March 2005,High hopes smashed,"I went to see this with my friends, and I was expecting the next Incredibles. Unfortunately this was not even close. It was filled with one liners. They weren't that funny and they were given away in the previews. I had high hopes for this film and it really let me down. The animation was flawless. And the whole movie was amazing from a def point of view. But the script was not as funny as I thought it would be. Also i kept waiting for something amazing to happen. It just wouldn't. By the end of the first half hour the rest of the movie could be figured out. Very unfortunate. I really wanted to like this film. Some of my friends liked it so it might just be my cynical point of view but i was disappointed."
134,Robots,,20 March 2005,Long on visuals short on content,"I thought this movie was fantastic visually (Especially in IMAX format!)and raises the bar for CG animation, however once you get past the eye candy, you still need to have a good story. Unfortunately ""Robots"" falls short of the mark with a yet another clichéd story of the small town hick going to the big city to make his mark on the world.The characters never really got fleshed out for me, I could never emotionally hook into any of the characters (Now granted these ARE robots) So I didn't really care what happened to them, nor was the Robin Wiliams character anymore then him doing a stand-up bit on Comic Relief.They spent too much time on the ""bankable"" star of the movie and not enough on anybody else.When you have an ensemble cast doing this kind of project, they need to be able to combine to form a whole so that the whole film benefits. I will probably watch this film again once it's out on DVD to see the other things I may have missed. But it is not a GREAT film, it is an average film with GREAT CG animation. See it for that. Pixar studios has nothing to worry about with this entry content wise. They are still the masters at story telling."
135,Robots,1,1 April 2005,"So much potential, ruined by Robin Williams","It's sadly telling that, in the wake of clean and yet very, very funny films such as Toy Story and The Incredibles, Hollywood still feels that audiences won't snicker unless they are bludgeoned endlessly by crude jokes and scatological humor. Such was the case with Shrek, but that film could at least recover by the strength of the rest of its script.Robots has no such saving grace. A visually delightful film filled with a stunning array of CGI effects, Robots is pulled down and sullied by the gutter-humor approach which is all too common in projects where Robin Williams is allowed to have too much creative control. Don't get me wrong -- Williams is a genuinely funny comedian and an excellent actor, but he has always suffered from a degree of Jekyll-and-Hyde where his humor is concerned. On the one hand, he can do hilarious comedic work cleanly an inoffensively in such pieces as Aladdin, Good Morning Vietnam, and the Mork & Mindy television series. On the other hand, his stand-up comedy is often far more crude and vile than many other comedians who are famed for it (George Carlin, Andrew Dice Clay, etc.). Williams doesn't seem to realize that he is much funnier when he is clean, and, in fact, that it's a much more clever exercise to be genuinely funny when a comedian purposely refuses to use the sophomoric tools of sexual and scatological antics.Robots is one of those films where too much of Williams' ""Hyde"" personality is allowed to come to the surface. A film made for and marketed at children has no business showing a robot urinating (never mind that they called it an ""oil change""), using gender-degrading dialogue (""Why is she called Aunt Fanny?"" ""Because we sure couldn't call her Aunt Booty!"" -- in reference to a robot with an over-sized posterior), and basically showing all the characters in the film being rude and denigrating to each other. If I want that, I'll go next door and watch Sin City.My children will definitely never see this film, because I don't want them using words like ""booty"" around the house, or making crude jokes that I would be embarrassed to hear them make at a restaurant. This saddens me, because I wish my children could enjoy Robin Williams the way I enjoyed him growing up in the late 70's and early 80's, watching Mork & Mindy. As a 30-year-old Army veteran, I don't think I fit the mold of a Bible-thumping retirement-age prude. But I do think that Robots is a disturbing indication of how the standards of Hollywood's comedy continue to slide, and how they don't care what the consequences are for America's children, culture, or civility. This film would have been far better off without Robin Williams in it, which is sad to say for someone with so much talent."
136,Robots,4,12 March 2005,Reminiscent of the late 90s,"You know I really did try to give this movie a chance, I did. But it just didn't hold it for me. In fact, it point blank left me speechless because of how bad it was. Now the animation was good, I can't deny that. But what I didn't like was the fact that they seemed to continuously wanted to top themselves from the previous scene. It was a whole ""you bet that was cool, look we can else we can do."" They wanted to exploit the use of the animation program they recently had gotten a hold of (if you don't believe that, watch the HBO behind the scenes show on this, they actually state the were trying to exploit the program).Now apart from being desensitized by the pure animation prowess of the studio, the story line was extremely dull as well. The whole time I watched it, I was being reminded of another film from the late 90s, ANTZ. A dismal little piece of animation most people I know would just as soon forget. In all honesty, after I thought some more about the ANTZ film, and the related Bugs Life, I started thinking about the characters in Robots. If you were to take away the attempt at trying to make them look like metal and instead tweaked the animation ever so slightly, you'd have the worlds of Bugs Life and ANTZ. Every character in Robots could easily become a character in either of these two films. Sort of a letdown in that regard as well.Overall, if you want to see this film, wait until it comes out on DVD. And for those of you who are wanting to see what happens to the squirrel from Ice Age at the beginning, there isn't anything after the closing credits. I guess you'll just have to wait for the next film these guys put out. Hopefully, that one will be better than this."
137,Robots,5,13 March 2005,Looking for mature humor like in Ice Age?...Look somewhere else...,"""Robots"" is the perfect example of how money making is done today. Take some bits and pieces of other stories and create a one page draft. Charakter development; nay, no need for that. Finally, do it the George Lucas way, take out all mature jokes, plot lines, action and character-development and voilà, a PG rating. You can take that to the bank. As icing on the cake: advertise this as a movie made by the makers of ICEAGE so you can also cash in on the older age-groups which expect something similar in quality as ICEAGE.Okay, why still 5 out of 10?Well, after watching 30 minutes of story unfolding I redirected my attention on the Technical side of the movie. I think the physics, dynamics and rendering of the CG-world in this movie is very well executed. The textures of the world are very rich and detailed. Also the materials like metals, plastics etc. look very real. Some scenes which have no dialog and are of a graphic nature, were very well executed in the sense of that they really draw your attention. Butt still the good technical execution of the movie cannot make up for the serious lack of story and character development and the misleading advertisement which involved ICEAGE.If you want your younger kids to have a fun time....by all means. If you want to have fun..... don't waste your time on this."
138,Robots,9,13 March 2005,"Hilarious, witty and great plot!","Says it all in the summary.The movie is better than it's predecessors - Ice Age and co. It has as the humour like Shrek, great animation like the Pixars, and has a strong storyline.Like all cartoons, this had a great moral to it, and what's a cartoon without a happy ending. This one has a great one!I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait for the DVD release. All in all 9/10 ++++++++++++++++++++!!!Go out and watch it!Highly recommended Thy1"
139,Robots,10,10 March 2005,It's alright!,"The movie Robots is an alright movie for kids and adults. It seemed slow at times but was kept up in part thanks to the comedy of Robin Williams. The movie had a lot of adult context in it to keep the adults entertained while the animation kept the kids entertained. If you must go see the movie I suggest not getting your hopes up for a great movie, I was quite disappointed when the movie was over because it just didn't seem to go anywhere. Like I told my friend there is only so much you can do with robots. I was really hopping that all the other characters would be funny just like Robin Williams but it was far from it. the one thing that is cool about the movie is for the robots they have that old 50's type of style to them which is pretty sweet. If you like a movie that is partially funny you'll like Robots."
140,Robots,10,8 March 2005,Excellent Movie,"I saw this at a sneak preview tonight. What a GREAT movie!! The cast is wonderful, the lines are hilarious. You'll laugh so hard that you'll miss stuff and have to see it again!! Robin Williams is pure brilliance - the Genie all over again!!! He had to have ad libbed at least 99% of his lines. The animation is wonderful. You'll see stuff from your childhood (well if you are 30+). Even though it is an animated movie, small kids will miss what it's about. It is more of an adult movie due to the script but if you take kids with you they will like the animation and the fast-pace nature of the movie. Definitely worth seeing more than once. I know I'll be buying this DVD when it is released to the public down the road."
141,Robots,10,8 March 2005,Excellent Movie,"It is an excellent movie, I thought I would be just for children, but I was wrong, it is very funny and exciting. One of the last scenes, the chase at the big wheels through the city is just amazing and very exciting. The characters are also very funny and the whole robots world is great because it makes similarities with our world just like the underwater world of Shark Tale.The colors are great, and animation and sound is one of the best I have seen. All the characters has great personality and their lines are very hilarious.It also has a lot of great messages like chasing your dreams, about love to our parents, about poor people having the same opportunities than others, that together as society we can beat any bad government or corporation, etc.I think that at IMAX could be a more better experience. Great for kids but also for their parents and everybody."
142,Robots,5,2 November 2009,Exhaust pipes.,"This is a visually terrific CGI animation made crude and tiring by the screaming frantic manic antics of Robin Williams bellowing tedious and pointless yakkety yak into what is essentially a Wizard of Oz style comedy with springs. The sweetness of Rodney and his family soon give way to headache inducing razzle dazzle that sags badly with toilet jokes. I only really like 50% of this well produced but ultimately exhausting film. Perhaps the producers were hi fiving themselves too early about having Robin Williams repeat his raucous Aladdin spin, but for any parent with a child who like to repeat watch their films, ROBOTS soon becomes one movie you hide just so you do not have to listen to it. However the visual style of the film is glorious: candy colors and hilarious small town sight gags abound, and the 50s technology of hometown Rodney are truly inspired. Then it shifts to the big city, enter Robin Williams babble and flicker and the movie simply springs apart. You'll watch this once or twice and then reach for another film. Permanently."
143,Robots,3,2 January 2009,Disappointing,"Let me start by saying that I'm an animation fan. I'd been saving ""Robots"" for a family night for my wife and I and our three year old.Technically the film was great. There were very creative visuals and the animation was excellent. The problem was the plot - or lack thereof. Half an hour into the movie, all that had happened was: Robot boy is born, grows up getting hand-me-downs, wants to be an inventor, and leaves for the big city. 45 minutes into the movie, I had no connection to any of the characters and I didn't care about any of them. The dad is a stereotyped ""my son will have a better life"" loser living in a stereotyped household where the mom's opinion does not matter.Our three year old, who will watch almost anything, was bored and jumping around the room 20 minutes into the movie. (This is the same child that will watch 60s classics like Lost in Space and Time Tunnel without saying a word for an hour.) We eventually turned it off halfway through. Maybe it got better at the end, but I wasn't willing to trade an hour of my life to find out."
144,Robots,3,1 May 2007,Bot Ugly ...,"Is it just me, or is there something utterly perverse when a multi-billion dollar corporation hopes to make tons of money by making a frivolous movie that is critical of multi-billion dollar corporations who produce frivolous products that are intended to make tons of money? ROBOTS is one such movie, though it is by no means a rarity. The Hollywood studios, among the most crassly capitalistic companies in the world, just love to churn out condescending movies designed to warn the masses of the evils of capitalism. But it is worth pointing out ROBOTS in particular because here is also a film that pointedly denounces the dangers of advancing technology -- even though it foregoes the elegant tradition of hand-drawn animation in favor of the cold and mechanize virtues of computerized CGI animation.Now, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with taking a stand on behalf ""the good old days,"" and ROBOTS tries desperately to cop an old-fashioned look and attitude. There is certainly nothing sleek and modern about the design or the message of the film; the stylized robotic characters in the film harken back to at least the 1940's and beyond, and the tiresome, mawkish sentimentality shoehorned into the story is probably as old as the written word. But such smug posturing is meaningless if the filmmakers don't practice what they preach. The elaborately designed Rube Goldberg images and action sequences are impressive, I suppose, in a purely mechanical way, but they have no sense of authenticity. The break-neck pace of the storytelling and the mass produced quality of the images make a mockery of the film's attempt to make its robot characters seem human or to make its message seem humane. The ramshackle nature of the inventions are intended to have a clumsy innocence to their instability, but are just too slickly executed to have any charm. Everything in the film is just so obviously counterfeit, like ""cheese food"" products that contain no dairy -- which is an apt comparison, because ""cheesy"" is certainly an appropriate adjective here.The story involves a starry-eyed, small town innocent, a robot named Rodney Copperbottom (voiced by Ewan MacGregor), who goes to the generically named Robot City to earn fame and fortune as an inventor. He discovers that the mega-corporation that apparently rules the entire society has been stolen from the god-like Bigweld (Mel Brooks) and taken over by the evil capitalist Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), who wants to force unnecessary ""upgrades"" on everyone, rather than to let them be themselves; mass produced uniformity over folksy individuality. Ratchet also wants to exterminate anyone who doesn't upgrade, thus the film dishonestly equates capitalism with Nazism. The film's ""be yourself"" message seems benevolent, unless you also interpret it as also meaning ""know your place."" In the end, the film seems to be a choice between the evil dictator, Ratchet, or the benevolent dictator, Bigweld -- with Rodney waiting in the wings as Bigweld's heir apparent.It is easy to read too much into any political message the film might harbor (especially with the loaded implication of a word like ""robots""), but the possible propaganda value of the tale is likely insignificant considering just how listless and uninspiring the finished film is. Despite the intricate, professional quality of the artwork, ROBOTS is remarkably unpleasant to even look at. The computer allows the animators to jam-pack every square of the film with busy little bits of chaos, yet the use of muted colors and flat images render the film strangely desolate. And being made of nuts and bolts and slapped together sheets of metal and mismatched parts, there is nothing remotely lovable about robots -- in general or these in particular. There is not a single endearing character in the film; indeed, they're all downright creepy. It says something when the filmmakers idea of making the robots seem human is by making them illogically flatulent.I suppose the filmmakers are trying to make some sort of statement about mankind, using robots as a metaphor, which makes no sense when robots by their nature represent impersonal conformity and the absence of spontaneity. Thus all the film's efforts at sentimentality come off as being from a pre-set computer program. Oddly, the more the filmmakers try to say that robots are people too, the more they seem to suggest that people are little more than robots. Maybe that is their view of the movie-going public."
145,Robots,5,21 May 2006,Nothing to write home about.,"Wasn't particularly excited to see this one in the theaters so I took my sweet time and eventually it made it's way into my home courtesy of Netflix and my some interest on the part of my wife. Boasting a vast star-studded cast of character voices ranging from such tiny cameos by the likes of Paula Abdul as ""Watch"" (yes, she played the voice of a wrist watch!) to Mel Brooks as the legendary Robot Inventor and ""Bigweld"".As proves true, though, in almost any film, all the star power and talent in the world can't make-up for a weak story and script. And that's my main complaint about this film. Drew Carrey, Paul Giamatti, Dan Hedaya, Greg Kinnear, Ewan McGregor, Jim Broadbent, Robin Williams and many other accomplished performers do their best to breathe life into stale stereotypical characters and throw a little sing into uninspired dialog riddled stale punchlines and one-liners. Of course the 3-D animated Robot world of the film is eye-catching enough and some of the sequences are kind of fun to watch, especially the central character Rodney's (McGregor) rather death-defying bout with public transportation when he first enters Robot City, the booming metropolis where he has gone to present his invention (a rather hyper little robot task-handler) to his life-long idol ""BigWeld"" the inventor.This film is another studio attempt to cash in on the successes of the past: not as witty and clever as ""Shrek"" and nowhere near the heart of ""ToyStory"". Though, ""Robots"" for me is a mediocre flick at best, I have no doubt that kids will probably enjoy it, I'm sure I would've if I was still a little 'un;)"
146,Robots,10,10 April 2006,"Wonderful, funny and classy","This is that rare bird, a wonderfully funny and touching movie, I would advise anyone to see this, fantastic cast and wonderfuly renedered.If I have a single bad comment it is with the {now every animation and movie has them} ""fart Jokes"", that aside this is brilliant.Pixar do it differently, Disney doesn't do it at all now, Ice agewas great, this is better.ALL the family will enjoy it, there are little adult bits throughoutand nothing very rude,Kids will adore it, and so will anyone who marvels at animation this good."
147,Robots,10,26 February 2006,fantastic,"when i saw robots i thought oh my god it looks rubbish ,its looks like a babies film but i was wrong the film was fantastic the movements of the robots are so realistic and when they talk it actually looks like there saying the word there meant to not a load of gibberish .Rodney's my best character the way he acts and with the voice of Ewan McGregor its sounds fantastic.I'm also pleased that robin William's was chosen for fender because the voice makes fender sound extremely funny.but there was one thing that shocked me and that was carry i could not tell that it was Halley berry .the whole storyline was fantastic ,the way that everything talked.some thing that i could not stop laughing at was when all the robots are doing arm farts and aunt fanny does a real fart and kills the lamp post that was hysterical.i also loved it at the beginning when Rodney's in the ball and there going round the what looks like a ride. also it was funny when all the robots go to the chop shop for war and fender says excuse me sir ,and she replies I'm a women and the blue robots eyes brakes.but anyway i loved the film and hope that there's a second version."
148,Robots,,23 June 2005,one of the weaker animated children films,"I have 4 children -- 3 boys -- so I suffer through a lot of children's entertainment. Some of these films -- Shrek, Toy story, Monsters Inc. -- are really good movies. But during others films (Finding Nemo, the Cat in the Hat, and yes, you guessed it, Robots) I was really suffering.To me Robots was utterly boring and silly. The concept was dumb. There is some humour in the idea of buying new (or used) parts to grow, but why do Robots need parents or need to grew up at all? But the children liked it so it was OK from their point of view. But even for them their response was pretty mild. Overall not really worth seeing (I sure hope no-one buys it on DVD for my kids -- eeeek)."
149,Robots,9,24 May 2005,Repair for an adventure with Robots!,"What movie can you see that has monsoons of dominos, break dancing inventions, robots actually doing the robot and a guest appearance from the Tinman? Robots, of course! The story of a young genius, Rodney Copperbottom (voice of Ewan McGreggor; Big Fish, Moulin Rouge!), who wants to suggest his invention ideas to the ever-popular Big Weld (voice of Mel Brooks; Life Stinks, High Anxiety). When he makes a trip to Robot City, he encounters many odd things from an executive of Big Weld named Cappy (voice of Halle Berry; Catwoman, Gothika), a corporate tyrant who only makes his journey worse called Phineas T. Ratchet (voice of Greg Kinnear; Godsend, Stuck on You) and a group of ""Rusties"" including Piper Pinwheeler (voice of Amanda Bynes; What A Girl Wants, Big Fat Liar) and Fender (voice of Robin Williams; Dead Poets Society, One Hour Photo).The most noticeable and incredible factor of this film is the acting. The acting is extremely strong and helps keep the movie ""alive."" As you can see, there are many big names also including vocal appearances from Terry Bradshaw, Drew Carey and Jennifer Coolidge.What you wouldn't expect from a film of this nature is inexperienced directing. Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha co-directed this movie together. Ice Age was their other creation, and they are currently working on its sequel.Musically, the film was very well put together. The music was just right and appropriate for each scene that it would loom. The soundtrack has not yet been announced, but the music was excellent.This motion picture is rated PG. There is some brief language and suggestive humor, but otherwise clean. This rating is spot on.Altogether, this movie was a great sight. The animation was advanced and made the movie entirely more enjoyable. If you are in the mood for a down-right good laugh, Robots may be right for you. It has some hysterical parts in which teenagers will love.The comedy in this movie isn't only for children under the age of ten accompanied by their parents. Teens will love it, too. Take your friends and have a great time!"
150,Robots,4,8 April 2005,Not another one...,"Yes, you've guessed right, this is yet another computer-animated film, filled with unnecessary morale and boring jokes. This worked out pretty good a few years ago when Pixar released ""toy story"" and ""a bugs life"" because then it was original and groundbreaking, the new visual style made you forget flaws in the story. However, while Pixar continues to evolve the genre by actually adding some story content, Dreamworks refuse to let go of the classic un-original storyline.It's about a Robot who travels to a new city to start a new life and i ask myself, haven't I seen this before? This movie reminds a lot of ""a bugs life"", despite the fact that you get the need to puke every time those uncomfotable morale-scenes show up. I think I laughed one time during the whole film, and the film is filled with jokes, silly and real childish, I don't think anyone over twelve years will laugh more than I did.I don't think that a movie can survive using special effects only, and since this movie is like one, big special effect with no interesting story whatsoever I have to give this movie 4/10. Dreamworks, you have to evolve a little!"
151,Robots,10,2 April 2005,Robots,"All I can say about Robots is that I have seen it, it is a top movie and a must-watch for all those movie fanatics. It is all about a young Robot, Rodney Copperbottom, who wants to be an inventor - just like the robot he sees on TV, Big Weld. His inventing capabilities are not useful in his home town, so he decides to go to Robot city and pay a little visit to Big Weld. Unfortunately, big Weld had apparently gone out of business years ago and it is up to young Rodney to sort it out. Along the way he meets friends including Fender - a very humorous robot. I would recommend this film to all ages, as it is a universal rating."
152,Robots,10,29 March 2005,The best movies are about something special. This is a movie-lover's movie.,"I waited eagerly for Robots because I am a fan of adventures and animated stories - especially big, bold and beautiful stories with great themes. Robots surpassed my expectations on every level; it threw in many surprises, and left me pondering seriously my own life and the world we've created for ourselves.First, it was a pleasure to fall into the mechanical world of the story; an extremely intricate and highly imaginative world that was also instantly understandable. Mechanical engineers and physicists alike would love this world, as it never broke any of its physical rules. I never once thought to myself, ""Why'd they do that?"" and never felt out of the story world. It was completely cinematic and thoroughly engaging.Second, Robots succeeds in its self-awareness as a filmmaker's movie. It must have been a riot to sit in on the filmmakers's story conferences. They obviously love great films because they referenced so many. Obvious references included Singing in the Rain, The Wizard of Oz, The Matrix, Star Wars, and even Ice Age. There were so many clever nods to other films and directors I can hardly remember them all. I have to see it again and find the Chris Wedge cameo a la Alfred Hitchcock. I'll bet it's in there! I will definitely keep an eye out for the next Chris Wedge, Carlos Saldanha or Lowell Ganz project.Third, McKee advocates a great story, well told, and I believe Robots accomplished this, with honors. Remarkably simple yet elegant, well written, and profound for its simplicity. Other commentaries give ample plot details, so I will not; I will, however, reveal what I believe the film is about. Robots is about devotion to your dream, being all you can be, honesty, integrity, courage, and especially, commitment. All of this without being sappy, sweet, cloying or pedagogic, but being entertaining, witty, and (even though its really an adventure and not a comedy) hilariously funny. Funny in the same ironic vein as The Princess Bride.Finally, I believe great films allow us to see ourselves and our world in a new or different light. As social commentary, Robots speaks about important issues of today, especially those that concern the ""invisible"" society around us, the clerks, shopkeepers. the hard-working poor and even the homeless. How easy is it for us to quickly forget, or to never even notice, the world we are not involved in? Yet Robots introduces us to characters who, though fashioned of metal, rubber, glass and plastic, are our neighbors, and even our brothers and sisters. Yes, they were humorous characters on the surface (or mean, spiteful, greedy villains) but underneath, the Robots were you and I. Some had dreams of greatness, others were content to be their own personal best, yet all shared what we all desire as human beings: the desire to live, love, and achieve whatever our worthy purpose is without fear of being relegated to the scrap heap and recycled simply because we are ""last year's model,"" inconvenient, or a ""burden"" to care for. This was the Robots experience for me, your humble servant. I hope I too may soon call a film of this caliber one of my own."
153,Robots,,10 March 2005,Geared Up Good Time,"The Story: Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) is a young inventor looking to make it in the big city by getting a job working for his hero, Big Weld (Mel Brooks). Unfortunately, some 'bots looking to place profit over providing have set Weld out of the way and Rod gets kicked to the curb. There, he falls in with Fender (Robin Williams) and his barely constructed crew. When they learn of the horrible things Weld's replacements have in store for their out-moded kind, they start a revolution to set things right.The Good: Funny funny funny. If there's one thing these guys know to do, it's setting up the laughs. The good Mr. Williams steals virtually every scene he's in, as usual, making every line count. If you're looking for a good time, this movie's it.Oooh, and it's purty. The robots themselves have great designs and the rust flecks, paint scratches, and such are very well done.The voice acting is excellent all around. I was pleasantly surprised at Ewan McGregor's performance, which managed to hold the young dreamer quality throughout the movie.The Bad: The love interest bit is tacked on. REALLY tacked on. I don't think I'm giving anything away in saying that it's Rodney and Cappy (Halle Berry), as it's amazingly obvious even from watching the mostly uninformative trailers. The predictability isn't really the problem, however, it's the fact that it's hardly ever brought up (it's only really implied that the two of them get together) and even when it is, it's horribly forced. There's also the bare elements of a love triangle, but it doesn't go anywhere. And personally, I think the setup for the second chica in the triangle would've led to a far more realistic resolution if they'd gotten together.Really, though, this is just a single symptom of a much larger problem. While the movie is most definitely funny, and the main plot line pelts along fairly well, the rest of the story is largely undeveloped, even for a family or kid flick. Fender and Piper are siblings, but little is done with it besides a couple of quick gags. It's never really touched on why Cappy ends up helping the out-modes (just can't resist a ruggedly rusted face, I guess), or why the bad guys want to trash the old 'bots besides basic greed. Several several points like this are brought up briefly just to be set on the wayside as soon as they stop providing laugh fodder, and because of this the movie becomes far more style than substance than is generally acceptable.And finally . . . well, this last point isn't really in the bad section because I think it's bad myself, but because it might influence those who are going to be taking their kids to see it. Strangely, for a movie about robots, there's an large amount of scatological humour. The ""third oil change today"" joke shown in a couple of the trailers isn't an isolated event. I took it all in stride, and the folks I was watching it with thought it was all funny as well, but parents who are leery about their kids seeing such might want to be careful going in.The Deal: Though it's set on a mostly incomplete foundation, Robots is extremely funny and definitely worth seeing. It's a fun family flick, and I'm sure it's going to end up taking up room in lots of peoples' DVD collection eventually."
154,Robots,6,13 March 2005,Family Fun Film,"Robots was a good film that the family would enjoy on a Friday night together. The story was nicely put together, the plot had some problems, but overall it was good. Robots kept you concentrated on the movie because of the flow with the storyline. Scenes such as the Domino Effect and the Transportation Device made everyone enjoy themselves. It's fun to watch 5 minute long effects such as these, because cause and effect plays with your mind and gets you to settle down.The city is composed of nothing but metal objects, but we don't know why. The reason for the entire world being robots wasn't explained. Being a child's film, no one seemed to mind, but critics would raise an eyebrow towards it. The exception of many funny moments cleared up your concerns about this though, so it was enjoyable nonetheless.6 out of 10. Many will see it but those who don't want to shouldn't be forced to view. Doesn't live up to the previous masterpieces of animations such as Shrek or Finding Nemo, but it ranges in the top 10 without a doubt."
155,Robots,10,10 March 2005,Absolutely Fantastic!!!!!!,"This movie is great! Hysterical!!! Lets go over a few of the reasons why this movie is so good! 1) Have you looked at the cast? It is amazing!! 2) It is hysterically funny and is definitely not just for kids!!!! The previews do not do this movie justice! I saw it at 12.01 am opening day (the first showing) and it was worth double the ticket price!!! SEE IT BEDORE YOU SEE ANYTHING ELSE!!! This movie starts out very cute leaving the audience wondering what is going to come. You sit there not knowing if it is going to be good or not. Though, it is creative what else is there? But suddenly in a matter of no time it picks right up with the laughs. Robin Williams is a genius with talents far beyond belief! He keeps you laughing from beginning to end, without a doubt a comedic genius. Drew Carey, I've missed him! Good to have him back and what a great movie to come back with. Amanda Bynes, as cute as ever! Ewan McGregor, even as a cartoon has the charm to make any women blush! Better then that he really shows off his comedic side in the movie! Please, like stated above, do not let the previews fool you this movie is great! If you liked FINDING NEMO, THE INCREDIBLES, or ICE AGE then this movie is the one for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
156,Robots,4,7 March 2005,"Children will love it, and it will provide a little fun for parents","Rodney Copperbottom (voice - Ewan McGregor) is a young genius inventor who dreams of making the robot world a better place for everyone. Rodney idolizes Big Weld (voice - Mel Brooks) the master inventor, and makes him his role model. Rodney has invented a gadget that will help his father clean the dishes at the restaurant. Rodney takes his invention to Robot City to see Big Weld and get a job as an inventor at his company. Rodney gets to see Ratchet (voice - Greg Kinnear), the new head of the company, who has him removed from his office. Cappy (voice - Halle Berry) a beautiful robot-executive of the company takes an interest in Rodney, and wants to help him. In the City, some old robots known as the Rusties, led by Fender (voice - Robin Williams), befriend Rodney. Ratchet believes the company can make a bigger profit if it stops making spare parts for older robots. Non-working robots are picked up and sent to the junk yard and melted down by Ratchet's mother. Rodney 'find a need and fill a need' begins fixing old robots. When Ratchet's mother orders him to stop Rodney, the fireworks begin. The computer-animated movie is full of robots of all different designs and rich in color. The roller-coaster ride Rodney takes when he arrives at Robot City is probably the best visual action scene of the movie. The movie has one major problem, the hero, Rodney, though animated, lacks the dimensions to allow the viewer to make an emotional connection to him. I wanted to root for Rodney, but he seem to be outside looking in, no connection. I think the movie was written for children under 10, even though, there are some adult gags the children won't understand. Children will love it, and it will provide a little fun for parents. (20th Century Fox, Run time 1:30, Rated PG) (4/10)"
157,Robots,9,14 March 2005,Very Enjoyable!,"really enjoyed this movie. The visual effects are so good that I didn't really care if there was a good story. However, there was! The son of an out-dated dishwasher robot goes to the big city to find the great robot inventor and share some ideas that he has. Along the way he meets up with Robin Williams who is a type of con-man robot with old parts and who is literally falling apart. Williams is excellent in this role and is the first cartoon role where I could understand him without being out of breath.The trip to the big city parallels for the robot inventor parallels Dorathy's trip to Oz in search of the elusive wizard. In fact there is a door guard that kind of reminds you of the door guard from The Wizard of Oz.We find that the great inventor has disappeared and an evil robot has taken over and has decided to force all old robots to the scrap heap, in an effort to sell robot upgrades instead of replacement parts.The movie pokes fun at big business and their constant downsizing and cutbacks in service to increase their bottom line.There are some amazing scenes such as a spectacular fall of dominoes and the trip that the young robot takes with the Robin Williams robot to the city.This movie is very different than the usual ""taking animal"" animations that seem to be mandatory in these types of films these days. With likable characters and some good music and a good feel that kind of reminded me of a souped up version of the old Gumby cartoons."
158,Robots,6,14 March 2006,"Excellent animation and occasional bits of fun, but needed a much better story.","I'm not going to use much space praising the quality of animation or CGI in this film. They are excellent, even better than Ice Age or Shark Tale in my opinion. There are some really funny moments like in the ballroom sequence or the at the very beginning with Rodney's birth.But what's really annoying in this film is integrating the human society into the robot society using blatantly stereotypical characterisation and clichés. I know (or should I just suspect?) that this is deliberate but if it really is, it serves no purpose other than giving a poor excuse for a storyline.This film can be easily avoided by grown-ups. There are better family animation movies."
159,Robots,,3 December 2005,terrific!,"This was a really good movie with a good voice cast. I found that the theme of the movie was chasing your dreams and never giving up. It had several funny lines and moments, and Robin Williams was superb in his voice role. Amanda Bynes and other actors were also good in it. I love the line delivered by Bynes's character:""My name's Piper. Rhymes with Viper."" A robot leaves home to pursue his dreams of becoming a famous inventor. His misadventures in his new city were classic. I thought the animation in the movie were marvelous. If you get a chance to see this movie, see it. You won't regret it.*** out of ****"
160,Robots,9,27 November 2005,Sheer Genius,"One of the best movies in a long time for kids and adults. The design work is sheer retro-genius and nostalgia for some of us older chaps who remember the pre-1960's style of things. Tremendous detail in the design and artwork, new layers come out in subsequent viewings.Excellent story line.Good emphasis on character and quality. Truly inspirational.This movie would be better if there were not so many jokes about flatulence which is a major negative.I only see a few movies with true greatness, and this is one of them that really surprised me how great it is."
161,Robots,8,17 October 2005,Repair for an adventure with Robots,"What movie can you see that has monsoons of dominos, break dancing inventions, robots actually doing the robot and a guest appearance from the Tinman?

The story of a young genius, Rodney Copperbottom (voice of Ewan McGreggor; Big Fish, Moulin Rouge!), who wants to suggest his invention ideas to the ever-popular Big Weld (voice of Mel Brooks; Life Stinks, High Anxiety). When he makes a trip to Robot City, he encounters many odd things from an executive of Big Weld named Cappy (voice of Halle Berry; Catwoman, Gothika), a corporate tyrant who only makes his journey worse called Phineas T. Ratchet (voice of Greg Kinnear; Godsend, Stuck on You) and a group of ""Rusties"" including Piper Pinwheeler (voice of Amanda Bynes; What A Girl Wants, Big Fat Liar) and Fender (voice of Robin Williams; Dead Poets Society, One Hour Photo).The most noticeable and incredible factor of this film is the acting. The acting is extremely strong and helps keep the movie ""alive."" As you can see, there are many big names also including vocal appearances from Terry Bradshaw, Drew Carey and Jennifer Coolidge.What you wouldn't expect from a film of this nature is inexperienced directing. Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha co-directed this movie together. Ice Age was their other creation, and they are currently working on its sequel.Musically, the film was very well put together. The music was just right and appropriate for each scene that it would loom. The soundtrack has not yet been announced, but the music was excellent.This motion picture is rated PG. There is some brief language and suggestive humor, but otherwise clean. This rating is spot on.Altogether, this movie was a great sight. The animation was advanced and made the movie entirely more enjoyable. If you are in the mood for a down-right good laugh, Robots may be right for you. It has some hysterical parts in which teenagers will love.The comedy in this movie isn't only for children under the age of ten accompanied by their parents. Teens will love it, too. Take your friends and have a great time!"
162,Robots,10,11 March 2005,"the next ""incredibles""!","i just got back from seeing this movie and it was well worth the 30 minute walk it took to get there. it was very funny and at some points the audience (myself included) was laughing so loud you couldn't hear the dialog. this was a very well made movie. I can see that a lot of time and effort was put into this movie, and it really shines through. I can not wait to take my whole family to see this. it has a lot of stuff for the kids and quite a few laughs for the adults. a perfect movie for all. it should be one of the funniest hour and thirty minutes of your life. well worth the $7.25 for the movie ticket. And i'm sure you will see why. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
163,Robots,3,2 April 2005,What a disappointment,"Someone wrote: ""Great animated film, adults will enjoy this one"" That's backwards imho... 5-10 year olds will like this... adults will be bored. Going into this I had visions of Toy Story, The Incredibles or even Ice Age. What I got was a poor seen-a-million-times story, OK computer visuals and equally just OK voices.This computer animated movies, while high tech wonders, can suffer from the same big mistake that many action movies do these days... they need a great story first, THEN you add in the great looks. I know many adults who rushed out and bought ""The Incredibles"" and ""Finding Nemo."" I can't fathom any adult rushing out to purchase this. C- for parents, B for the tiny tots since they did laugh at the fart jokes."
164,Robots,1,22 March 2005,A movie for not to be bought in DVD o VHS,"I saw this movie with my four children and they realized that there was something weird and abnormal in the red robot (I don't remember its name) I told them that it was a ill or insane robot that didn't know its gender (male or female). It is a shame that in the last movies for kids, the ""gay power"" try to confuse the new generations. It is the same with the movie ""Shark tales"". The movie is also full of good things to learn but just one bad stuff it is enough to spoil the film. Definitely, I am going to see this kind of movies just with my wife before taking my kids to the movie theater. My young kid asked me if we were going to buy the DVD I told him that we were not going to aloud enter a bad influence to our home."
165,Robots,6,6 April 2009,Robots,"From director Chris Wedge (Ice Age), I had seen plenty of clips of this all-star CGI animated adventure, and there was no doubt I would try it. Set in the future of 2706, in a world populated entirely by mechanical machines and beings, Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) grows up with the ambition to be an inventor, and showcase his ideas to the master inventor Bigweld (Mel Brooks), especially with his father Herb (The Terminal's Stanley Tucci) struggling to make a living. So Rodney sets to Robot City to showcase his ideas to Bigweld, but it seems his company has been taken over by new head, the greedy Ratchet (Greg Kinnear). When Bigweld eventually decides to help out, and along with his new friends, the old robots known as the Rusties, led by the eccentric Fender (Robin Williams), and company executive Cappy (Halle Berry), Rodney is determined to stop both Ratchet and his mother Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent). Also starring Amanda Bynes as Piper, Jennifer Coolidge as Aunt Fanny, Edward Scissorhands' Dianne Wiest as Mrs. Copperbottom, Paul Giamatti as Tim the Gate Guard, Natasha Lyonne as Loretta Geargrinder, Paula Abdul as Watch, James Earl Jones as Voice Box at Hardware Store, Jay Leno as Fire Hydrant, Heroes' Stephen Tobolowsky as Bigmouth Executive/Forge and Chris Wedge as Wonderbot/Phone Booth. The animation is very good, and the voices all add to the fun, definitely one for the family. Good!"
166,Robots,2,3 December 2008,"Oh Robots, let me count the ways you suck:","1.Robin Williams. You don't need to shout. Your crude, wooden impersonations weren't funny when we heard them ten years ago; they won't be now. 2.It's a novel idea to have a movie about the working class life... the conflicts of what you dream of doing and what you must do. Yeah, the film kind of sends mixed messages there, and even abandons it near the end. 3.Poor character design. I don't care about any of the misfit robots, not to mention Rodney himself. They're so boring, so safe and completely predictable. 4.The comedy. This film is laden with Robot jokes, jokes about the posterior and the toilet, just to name a few. 5.Near the end of the film, there exists a completely unnecessary, utterly tacked-on action scene that's unbelievably boring. I could go on, but I'd really rather not. I'd rather be watching better animated films. Nice visuals, though. That's about all I can say in the way of praise."
167,Robots,5,13 March 2006,Kids should get a kick outta this...,"...but I won't even try to guarantee any satisfaction for anyone over the age of eighteen. I am a thirty-something guy who generally has a soft spot for animated t.v. and movies and I cannot say I was particularly impressed.In a world populated by entirely all robots,young,idealistic inventor Rodney Copperbottom(voice of Ewan McGreggor)heads to the big city to work for his idol and inspiration,Big Weld(voiced by Mel Brooks). What he discovers at BigWeld's factory is a top-down corporation that is into basically doing maintenance upgrades and trashing original,albeit faulty,mechas,instead of creating new and better machines. It's run by a venal mamma's boy of an exec named Ratchet(voiced by Greg Kinnear,who else,right?),who plots to do away completely with BigWeld's original designs and,in essence,the spirit of this company.The artwork and imagery is pretty much this show's saving grace,and directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha along with Blue Sky Studios can be credited with giving this show a distinct and colorful look of its own.But the story,penned by Ron Mita and Jim McClain seems to be,at best idealistic and childlike in awe and at worst,lazy and surprisingly unimaginative(for example:wouldn't you be able to come up with a name for a city populated by robots,in a world and universe full of robots should have a name OTHER than ""Robot City"",one might think). Then,there is the issue of the celebrities. To me,it shouldn't BE necessary to fill a movie--any movie,but family movies and/or films based on original text(i.e.Dr.Seuss,among others)--with celebrity voices or appearances,as it suggests that the studio,director,producers,etc. have no faith in the story or original product and instead trust that name recognizability--in this instance:Robin Williams,Halle Berry,Amanda Bynes,Kinnear,McGreggor,Drew Carey,Mel Brooks among others--will draw viewers. While,in fact,that may NOT be the intent of the makers of the film,it gives off a sense that WHO is in the movie is more important than WHAT the film is about. To me,that is kind of a shame.Anyways,this movie should have kids who aren't too picky about their entertainment and adults who can ride the good-natured wave of it to be pleased.Those of us who maybe wanted a little more originality,skill or cleverness to raise the value of animated entertainment will probably feel slighted by Robots."
168,Robots,10,6 January 2006,its so cute!,"This movie was the cutest movie I've ever seen in meh life! I instantly fell in love with what i think is the cutest robot character in that movie, Diesel Springer. he is so adorable! when he smiles his mouth is like...a wheel so it turns to his mouth shape! i thought that was so creative! the whole movie is creative the graphics are awesome and the DVD shows deleted scenes of the original sketches 2step of animating and so on its so neat! i love all he characters and for all you guys who love rap, one of the robots sing the song RIGHT THURR form CHINGY! its so adorable this movie is not a waste of your money its a really heart warming movie and your kids will love it. Monika green age 14"
169,Robots,10,18 November 2005,"Cobbled together with some old parts, and it shines brighter than gold!","I watched this film sometime ago with my sister and when I did, I wasn't expecting too much, but I was blown away by its effects and its characters. The joys of this film are in the backgrounds and character design, as well as flawless animation, along with its excellent story lines and loathsome villains. With a stable storyline, this film was clearly one of the best computer animated in many years. what makes this film so good, in my opinion, is its message conveyed to all people, old and young.The story centers around a young robot who wishes to go and pursue his dream of being a inventor, despite his own limitations. With this in mind, he eventually teams up with a ragtag group of destitute robots who seem to have lost the will to go on with life. But while the group becomes a tightly knit group of friends, an evil plot takes place to destroy all old robots who cannot afford rich niceties. The group then teams up to go and bring back the only robot who can put an end to this heinous act. Simply put, this film is excellent in terms of animation and moral. I'd give it an eleven out of ten, were it possible."
170,Robots,10,11 October 2005,Surely an award winner!,"What can i say i watched this movie today and nearly fell of my chair.. totally outstanding in every respect The cgi animation is stunning, it's painfully funny, there is so many subtle gags that just keep you chuckling. It amazes me how the writers kept up such a high standard of humour throughout the entire film..genius! I was very surprised to find that the movie was not made by Pixar/Dreamworks,i did not think anyone else was capable of churning out a movie of this quality. If it does not win any major awards it would be an injustice. I am going watching it again.(I bought it for the kids, honest!) This movie deserves a 10 out of 10."
171,Robots,7,27 September 2005,Just for the nuts and bolts of it...dreams mean progress.,"From the same people who gave us ICE AGE(2002)...ROBOTS is a ground-breaking animated film that is hilarious, charming and fun for all ages. Dazzilng, heartwarming and eye riveting. A young small town robot must journey to the big city in order to prove his inventive wizardry. With the help of some misfit mechanical friends, he gets closer to his life long dreams. He actually falls in love, teams with an aging innovator and battles an egotistically arrogant CEO. An all-star voice cast and visual style makes ROBOTS the terrific adventure it is. Just a few of the voices you'll may or may not recognize: Robin Williams, Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Mel Brooks, Amanda Bynes, Greg Kinnear, Jay Leno, Terry Bradshaw and James Earl Jones. Prepare to be amazed."

173,Robots,5,11 May 2005,A showcase showcasing as a movie,"From the all-star cast to the wonderful CG, this plot less bore is nothing more than an overly expensive voice and animation talent show.Robin Williams literally shows his teeth in this film -- his jokes and comedic style are getting extremely old. Some of the problem is likely due to the truly ugly character he voices. It looks like a lanky fire hydrant and severely diminishes William's natural charisma. It's odd that CG can't keep up with Williams like more conventional animation did in ""Aladdin."" The lower class vs. the upper class story is one that will never get old, but they way this film tells it, you simply don't care for the characters, what they do, or what really happens. Yes, they're robots, but it's not the audience's job to compensate for the difficulty of caring about the emotions and ""lives"" of inanimate objects. ""The Brave Little Toaster"" managed to do it. In the end, one watches ""Robots"" all the way through simply to hear a few decent jokes and watch the pretty graphics. Nothing else is of significant here."
174,Robots,8,3 May 2005,Better than I thought it would be.,"Robots, at first, scared me. A huge celebrity voice cast usually is overkill. But when I saw it, I guess it made some sense. I still have a few bones to pick with it. Halle Berry's character was one who I could see the movie without and still get it. Overkill. Greg Kinnear was O.K., but his character seemed a little annoying after a while. Jennifer Coolidge's Aunt Fanny was, well, a cheap place for cheap laughs. But other than that, I have few complaints about the cast. Robin Williams, Drew Carrey, Amanda Bynes, and Harland Williams were well cast as the slightly out-dated robots. Mel Brooks had a pretty good turn as Big Weld, but didn't really have enough to do. Actually, none of the actors had enough to do. Anyway, Ewan McGreggor was fine as Rodney. But my favorite performers in this film were not even billed in the poster. Jim Broadbent was great playing the mother of Ratched (Greg Kinnear). Paul Giamatti was hilarious as Tim, the gate guard. Diane Wiest was great as Mrs. Copperbottom. But I liked Stanley Tucci's Herb Copperbottom. His character gave actual meaning to a screwball comedy. Heh, heh, Screw. Anyway. one other problem I had with it was one scene where everyone was having a farting contest. Honestly, people are pretty sick of that stuff. Unless they are 12 year old boys. Otherwise, I thought it was a fine movie."
175,Robots,9,3 May 2005,real good animation movie for kids...,"i am 30 and yes i really liked the movie. i liked the ""robotcity"", lots of brilliant ideas. well i also learn't a few good things, about dreaming, we all have dreams but somethings just don't workout properly for everyone, but yet we should always go and try for it... ""...u can shine no matter of what u'r made of..."" i like all the characters and enjoyed them , the movie is good at humor, and also made me laugh... it indeed is difficult job , i suppose to make it work when u have ROBOTs as characters because there it makes tough to bring out those EXPRESSIONS on the face...though sometimes i also felt the lack of it...though the storyline is too simple , but thats what it requires, as the movie is meant for children's, and basically the idea is to tap the child's imagination, and the potential each one has inside to make things wonderful.......just like the creative minds behind the movie... i suggest this movie for everyone...go and watch it...if u have not seen it... thanks.bye..."
176,Robots,10,30 April 2005,Robots,"Robots is a very funny movie. It is a great family film. I voted a score of 10 for Robots. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a comedy. The average vote for Robots is only 6.4. I want it to get a higher vote score. What is your favorite character in Robots? I do not know mine. I highly recommend it. It is a wonderful family film. It is rated PG. It is rated PG because there are some inappropriate jokes in it, but it is still very funny. I think you should be at least 5 to see it. One of the reasons is because it probably is not appropriate for a four year old and the other reason is they would not get most of the joke. It is a very funny comedy movie."
177,Robots,9,29 April 2005,Surprisingly Entertaining and Funny,"I am in college and I took my little sister who is in middle school to see it the 2nd week it was out. Besides the fact that the theater was packed full with screaming/crying little brats, it was an enjoyable movie. The animated characters actually had depth and developed. The entire movie was funny both for the children and the adults. The actual animation of the film was incredible and the actors did a great job. Robin Williams was especially funny with his character, he made both the kids and adults laugh. Also, it became a little emotional. I actually cried in part of it. I am known to be sentimental, but for a cartoon? yes, it was that good. Robots is a good (and clean) family film that will keep you laughing the who time and that you can watch many times."
178,Robots,10,23 April 2005,The minds behind Ice Age bring us another computer animated delight.,"So, maybe I'm just daft, but I really don't see why this is rated PG. It's certainly not the violence level, and I really didn't notice much of anything in the way of language. Maybe some of the jokes were geared a little more at adults (no pun intended), but really. PG? Whatever. For once, I agree with the Canadian rating of G over the American rating. How often does that happen? Anyway, Robots comes to us from the same folks who did Ice Age. The computer animation has been bumped up a notch, or at least it looks to have been in my opinion. The movie is very amusing and very well-polished. I thoroughly enjoyed it.So, on to the plot. Rodney Copperbottom grew up getting nothing but hand-me-downs and second best parts. But it never really bothered him, for the most part. He still enjoyed his family life and did the best he could at everything. Even from a young age, he wanted to be an inventor. As he's growing up, he's constantly tinkering away at a little invention. I forgot what it's called, but it's basically a dishwashing assistant. Which was probably inspired by his father, a dishwasher.Anyway, Rodney dreams of going into Robot City and working for Mr. Bigweld and getting his inventions out there to the public. So he takes a few of his belongings and hops a train to the big city. Alas, when he gets to Bigweld's business, Bigweld is nowhere to be seen, and they aren't taking just any old inventor in off the street anymore to do their stuff. So Rodney decides to crash the party and fly over the gate, since he is determined to have his invention seen. The new management is less than impressed and has him thrown out.So Rodney spends some time out on the streets, where he meets a few new people, like Fender, for example, voiced by Robin Williams. When they all find out that Bigweld Industries is no longer making parts for older models and all that they can buy are overpriced upgrades, the masses flock to Rodney to repair them. He's okay doing this for a while, but eventually there are just too many of them and it becomes apparent that further action must be taken.Rodney and Fender crash the Bigweld ball in hopes of speaking to Mr. Bigweld, only to find out that Bigweld is still not around. But they do find out that the reason Bigweld Industries is only cranking out new hot items is that it will force the outdated robots to turn themselves in and let themselves me melted down for scrap.I won't go into anymore detail on the plot, you'll have to watch it for yourself. Trust me, it works.There are a few scenes in this movie where the CGI is just phenomenal. My personal favorite scene was when Rodney and Fender ride the ball. It's too complex to describe, but dang if it isn't impressive.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (go watch it now)"
179,Robots,5,23 April 2005,Too preachy,"I'm all for ""kids movies"" to have a moral or teach a lesson, but this one was beating you over the head with the moral of the story.. way too preachy and just not funny enough. The best animated movies today have good humor for kids and adults while teaching a little lesson. This movie didn't have the right balance and lacked the original humour of a movie like ""The Incredibles"". The main character was too ""goody goody"" and not ""real"" enough to make the events of the story have meaning. It's easy for Mr. goody-two-shoes to do the right thing and come out on top.. it's more meaningful when a character with flaws that we can relate to makes the right choices and fights for what's right."
180,Robots,8,16 April 2005,Robots: 8/10,"Although it was a moderate success, no one really remembers Ice Age (although there is a sequel to it coming out). The studio combination who did that movie now have done Robots. They obviously must have read my Ice Age review, with my criticism of the humans in that movie, because there are none here in Robots. Instead, Blue Sky creates characters that basically look like whatever they want. And I have to say, it's a big improvement.Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) is a lower-class robot who is made from hand-me-down parts. He, along with most of the other robots, look up to and idolize Bigweld (Mel Brooks), the friendly, helpful leader of the corporation that makes all of the robot parts. Rodney decides to invent something and show it to Bigweld, so he goes to Robot City to try and meet him. However, Bigweld has become reclusive and the company's been taken over by Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), an evil robot. Rodney's taken under the wing of Fender (Robin Williams), a bum of a robot, and his friends, who include a smattering of pseudo-celebrity voices. Rodney has to go find Bigweld, stop Ratchet and his evil plans, and go deeper into an amazingly animated world.Animation's basically staying the same these days. Ever since Toy Story, studios have gone with the ""if it ain't CGI, don't make it"" strategy, and it's seemed to hold up well box office-wise. Robots is a CGI animated film. And it's not as groundbreaking animation-wise as, say, Shrek was. But the sheer complexity of the film completely overwhelmed me. There are a few sequences that are just breathtaking, such as the public transportation in Robot City and Bigweld's dominoes. During those scenes, you just think to yourself, ""Why aren't other movies this fun?"" And that's all Robots is-fun. It's a simple movie that can be enjoyed by kids and adults. Not only can everyone enjoy the visuals, but the script (by those bad boys of comedy Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel) has both adult and child humor (such as ""making a baby"" and the onslaught of fart noises, respectively).People have also said that Robin Williams adds a lot to the comedy, which is a total lie. Williams has been going downhill ever since his magnum opus Mrs. Doubtfire, and Robots is here to prove it. Williams seems to just keep on talking and talking without really knowing what he's saying, and most of it isn't funny. Luckily, there's an amazing supporting cast to pick up his pieces. Although McGregor's accent comes and goes, there's Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent (playing a woman), Brooks, Amanda Bynes (although I'm not sure if that's an asset to the movie...her lines just seemed embarrassing), Drew Carey, Jennifer Coolidge, Paul Giamatti, Kinnear, Stanley Tucci, Dianne Wiest, Harland Williams...the list goes on. The superb cast really adds a lot to the movie. They play off of the animation, and the combination works really well.Have I any complaints, you ask? I would have liked to have seen more, but it's an animated movie, not Apocalypse Now. Also, at the end, there's the obligatory huge dance scene at the end. If there's a more blatant rip off of Shrek's unnecessary dance scene, I haven't seen it. Still, though, Robots is a true family movie, something we haven't seen for a long time.My rating: 8/10 Rated PG for some brief language and suggestive humor."
181,Robots,5,16 April 2005,It's NOT Ice Age......,"Robots is the newest creation brought to us from the same team that gave us Ice Age . I've seen Ice Age, and this is NO Ice Age.Robots is the story of Rodney Copperbottom voiced by Ewan McGregor , a young and enterprising inventor robot vying to one day work for the greatest robot of them all, Mr. Bigweld voiced by Mel Brooks. Rodney leaves the security of his home, parents, and small town to fulfill his dreams of working in the big city for Bigweld Enterprises. Whilst on his journey, he is befriended by a rag-tag group of robots called the Rusties, headed by Fenders (who is voiced by Robin Williams). Unbeknownst to Rodney, a young and upcoming robot called Ratchet (voiced by Greg Kinnear) has plans to annihilate all older model robots by stopping the production of repair parts. Any robots needing repairs must upgrade their model, or parish to the underworld of scrap-metal; ruled by Ratchet's mother, Madam Gasket.The CGI in this film is visually phenomenal; however, the storyline reeks and the dialog hardly clever. The film spends exuberant time on multiple disconnecting scenes such as the ""city transit system"" and ""domino falling"" sequences, which are beautiful to watch; however, meaningless to the plot of the film. A little more TLC on this film would have done wonders; it truly has potential of being special, but falls short.http://farisreel.com"
182,Robots,8,10 April 2005,Another challenger enters!,"The war of animation between Pixar and Dreamworks has taken on a whole new dimension with this re-entry into the fray from Blue Sky Studios, the people who brought us the brilliant Ice Age. Robots is both witty and goofy, with appeal for children and adults alike.The vocals are provided by a stellar cast, including Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Jennifer Coolidge, Paul Giamatti, Mel Brooks and Greg Kinnear, but it is Robin Williams' unique brand of over-energetic humour that provides the majority of the comedy, and one cannot help but feel that he might have had some influence on the script, and you can nearly hear the director encouraging him to cut loose. The story is a very simple one, if occasionally descending into the anarchic, and is all the better for it. The laughs come thick and fast for the children, and for the adults too there is much to enjoy. There are several gags that will sail over the heads of the little ones, and parents can also play spot-the-movie reference, and there are many (and a surprising range) to find - from Singin' in the Rain to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, to name but a few.The film is only 90 minutes long, but perhaps this is just as well. It often threatens to descend into parody, almost to the level of winking at the camera. However, it just manages to avoid this, and the chaotic fun provided for children and the subtler humour for adults will make this perfect holiday viewing to keep them quiet."
183,Robots,5,7 April 2005,Robots (2005),"Ewan McGregor is Rodney Copperbottom, a young robot who wants to dreams of becoming a famous inventor. He moves to the big city, only to have his dreams crushed when he finds out his idol is no longer in control of his company and Ratchet (Greg Kinear), has taken control. Like many CGI animated movies this film deals with a new and exciting unseen world. The plot is unfortunately not as original or interesting as other computer animated adventures. It is also light on comedy, unlike it's predecessors. 'Robots' is much more childish, but still enjoyable. The characters are given sparse screen time, to the point where we do not get to know or really care about any of them. Other characters just seem boring, such as Rodney's love interest. The animation is hardly ever interesting, something that is becoming more and more difficult. It is a film where one action scene leads to the other, rather than fleshing out characters and relationships. It seems the film is scared of becoming boring itself. Only one scene really stands out and that is the exceptional domino scene, which then escalates into absurdity (which is OK for a family film). All the voice actors are well placed, fitting their characters very well, although as I mentioned before the characters don't really have much to do. Robin Williams isn't used to his full extent, with his ad lib never reaching the hilarious heights of 'Aladdin'. The films consequences are inevitable, you know where the film is headed, which may come as a relief to some younger viewers but it is predictable for the rest of us. Being a huge fan of Tom Waits it was great to hear one of his songs used to such brilliant effect. Compared to Blue Skies earlier animated 'Ice Age' this film seems like a poor sibling. It starts off promising with some very clever and funny set-ups such as the making of the baby. Overall we have a film with great potential but boils down to a regular family film that is enjoyable, but probably only worth the one watch."
184,Robots,8,31 March 2005,*You can shine no matter what you're made of!*,"This movie is great for all ages! Although the comedy may sometimes be a bit couched for the adults,or a bit juvenile for youngsters, it can make anyone laugh. The animation is clear, and flamboyant. The cast is phenomenal, many voices that you will recognize. Robin Williams is a hoot, Ewan McGregor has the right amount of swiftness, along with Drew Carrey, Amanda Bynes, and Halle Berry. The movie has great themes, principals, virtues,values, etc...none the less, a must-see! This movie is a great pick-me-up, and just a good way to spend a Saturday night. I know I'll watch it again and again. The whole idea of steel, screws, nuts, bolts and titanium gives a very futuristic tone. At times it can be a little difficult to follow, but you quickly catch up. This movie is great to see with anyone!"
185,Robots,5,29 March 2005,Robots No More than Shiny Parts,"In the world of Pixar, all other animation attempts seem to pale in comparison. At one time, Walt Disney was the king of these colorful stories. Now the new age of animation has come about with stories that appeal to kids on that same colorful level being mixed with subtle under texts that appeal to older audiences.Kids films do well because of repeat business. Kids like to see the same thing over and over and over again. So, needless to say, the business is very lucrative and it's good to have your name attached to it as to assure yourself a piece of that money making pie. Because of that, names like Mike Meyers, Will Smith, Robert Dinero, Holly Hunter, Renee Zellweger and old favorite, Robin Williams, have all invested time to do some voice acting. Who would have thought this job stereotypically for ugly people would have Halle Berry among its ranks? Rodney Copperbottem (Ewan McGregor going PG for a day) is a bot made from second hand parts. His father is a dishwasher and cannot afford to give him the fancy accessories that other kids have. Bigweld (Mel Brooks), who believes everyone is special and can succeed one way or another, inspires Rodney. So he travels to the city to get a job as an inventor from Bigweld. Here it meets the random bot Fender, who is voiced by Robin Williams. We have come to expect something from Robin after the days of playing the genie in Aladdin. But here it feels as if he has been roped into the script, which is never the way that Robin Williams works best. He can't even stay on topic when being asked the simplest questions such as what is you father's profession on Inside the Actor's Studio.As said above, the new standard for animated films are ones that appeal to all ages. So when Fox came along with the been there, done that concept that is Robots, I have to wonder who gave the green light on this project. There is an attempt at the subtext with the message that 'you can shine no matter what you're made of' but that is just more proof of the been there, done that aspect, and this one lacks some of the better parts that others who've tried this storyline, not to mention the complete lack of cultural references that have become a must since Shrek 2 saturated itself with them.Perhaps Robots is simply a concept film. After all, it is very original to think of building all your sets and actors from scrap metal. This is a film that you buy for the incredible special features on the DVD. You might as well throw away the disc that contains the film and just keep the disc with the extras on it. Actually, better yet, use the first as a costar for you beverage to keep you refreshed while you enjoy the content of disc 2. **1/2 out of *****"
186,Robots,,26 March 2005,"Great visuals, good jokes, fair characters, poor plot","Fox tries to trump Dreamworks and Pixar with ""Robots,"" a mild family comedy about the dreams and exploits of out-dated robots in a world where humans don't exist. My title pretty much speaks for itself, but I'll elaborate. I'll start with the worst part, the plot itself. It follows young, poor bot Rodney Copperbottom (say that three times fast), as he goes to the big robot city in an attempt to chase his dreams and become an inventor. This takes about 20 minutes. The ending that is so predictable that telling it wouldn't be a real spoiler (but I won't anyway), takes 25 minutes. The rest of the story could contain about an hour of great character development, subplots, jokes, and visuals, but it's over in 15. Very inconsistent plot. Moving up a step, the characters. They're pretty hit or miss. Euan McGregor has an unconvincing American accent as Rodney, but plays the character in a mildly charming matter. Robin Williams as Fender, is basically a caricature of every cartoon character he's ever done, especially ""Aladdin's"" Genie, but that's sort of the point. It's funny for the kids, and the adults get the reference. Greg Kinnear is a completely unconvincing villain in Ratchet, a vain robot who somehow idolizes his hideous mother (Oscar winner Jim Broadbent in a surprisingly funny role). And the great Mel Brooks has a supporting role as Bigweld, Rodney's idol. He has some funny moments, but a character this cutesy and childish takes Brooks further out of his element than when he produced ""The Fly."" The supporting cast, however, led by Halle Berry and Drew Carey, could have stolen the show, if they were given any development. The jokes are more for the adults, save for the farting sequence about 25 minutes in. The Women's restroom is an electrical outlet with two circles and a ground hole underneath. The ""fake"" watches are actually ""American Idol"" judges Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson, and Simon Cowell. The best joke for the kids is by far Fender dressed as a robetess, dancing to Britney Spears. Now onto the big show, the visuals. Fox really outdid itself in its attempt to best the animation leaders. The city-scape of Robot City, and the cross-town express sequence has the same mind-blowing effect as the frozen lake sequence in ""The Polar Express."" If you see it on IMAX, it should be breathtaking. It's very impressive to almost see life-like qualities in the animation of things that can never be real. Part of the flaws of Pixar and Dreamworks films like ""The Incredibles"" and ""Shrek,"" is that human characters can never quite look real. So Fox fixed the problem. No humans, no humanistic expectation, then they can go for as much shine and detail as they want, and it's a visual marvel. Good for a look in the theatres, definitely worth renting on DVD later on, and if you get a shot, an IMAX viewing should make you wet your pants."
187,Robots,5,27 March 2005,Meaningless movie,"If you go to any dictionary or encyclopedia you find with more or less words the following definition of the word ""robot"": a machine that resembles a human and does mechanical, routine tasks on command; any machine or mechanical device that operates automatically with humanlike skill (Webster's). Which means that robots are inconceivable without and inseparable of a human society for which they work and which they help. This movie however presents a society of robots living in a world from which the humans are totally absent, a world of robots living for themselves despite the fact that they are anthropomorphic thus presupposing a human society that paradoxically seems not to exist in fact since those robots live on themselves and for themselves totally. Therefore this similarity is totally meaningless and even deceiving. After this what's left is an ordinary story of a fight of the oppressed against the oppressors told with the usual computer techniques not especially original in comparison with lots of other animation movies we have seen. Anthropomorphic animals have greater meaning since they are living beings and not pieces of uninteresting tin scrap. This tendency that certain recent animations movies have to replace living beings (animal or human) by anthropomorphic machines of various shapes and kinds is abominable and inhuman indeed."
188,Robots,8,26 March 2005,"""Robots"" is a under rated gem!","What can I say? I really enjoyed this movie. The story is simplistic but contains the kind of messages that kids should here. The standard adult humor that has worked its way into these movies since ""Shrek"" set a new standard in irreverence is also here but much more subtle this time. (This is good as I don't feel guilty about laughing when surrounded by fifty little tykes.) We live in such a cynical age when a good hearted sweet movie likes this gets bashed so heavily by the critics. Damn people, lighten up.The animation is awesome. It is one of the most inventive worlds ever created since the new wave computer animation was started back with ""Toy Story"". Granted the animation isn't quite up to Pixar's very high standards but its close and what it lacks in polish it makes up for in imagination. This world is a wonder to look at. My suggestion to all is whether you have little ones or not, get out there and see this entertaining movie while you still can. The big screen was made for movies like this."
189,Robots,,25 March 2005,"Not nearly as good as ""Incredibles"" or ""Shrek 2"", but still worth renting","This cartoon is not really bad, but once we start seeing fart jokes or adult-oriented gags on screen,- we know that screenwriters have run out of ideas. ""Robots"" is not witty, nor funny, it's just plain ""standart"", which is a big minus because lately viewers expect all cartoons to be of Pixar quality. Unfortunately, it's not nearly as hilarious as last year's Shrek2, or as heartwarming as Incredibles. ""Robots"" seem more like an eye candy (visuals are really great here) that was made from a script that was written on the paper napkin in twenty minutes, where most of the jokes just don't work.Overall, there are some good jokes far in between, and visuals are really superb, but this movie just don't have the spark that would put it above ""average"" level. Worth renting or seeing in theater if you have small kids, though.6/10"
190,Robots,7,23 March 2005,Brilliant,"The best work i have seen using computers, it even compares with i,robot which is superb!!i would say this is the one of the best children's films i've seen!Just Superb, no comment otherwise.The amount of work the director did was fantastic.The voices were natural.The filming superb!I would give this ******** stars.If there is a film to recommend this is it. Colateral is only just in the same league as this surreal film. Its just so brilliant!!Highly recommended for children!!"
191,Robots,10,22 March 2005,good movie,"i thought this was a really good movie for the whole family.it was unique and funny with wonderful characters.it teaches you to dream big and never give up on what you believe in.its a very good story.we bought the book from the movie at the bookstore and it is very good also.we are really looking forward to getting the play station 2 video game for it as well and buying it when it comes out.it has lots of fun and cute characters.i think our favorites were Rodney,aunt fanny and piper.it has some really funny parts for children and adults both.i liked the very beginning where the copperbottoms first got their robot son Rodney.it was also cute watching him grow up and see him changing from a baby bot to a young independent bot.we also have been going to burger king like 3 times a week just to get the different robot figure toys from the kids meal my son! its a wonderful film and i highly recommend it."
192,Robots,6,17 March 2005,The most gorgeous movie to date....and that's about it...,"I'm a big graphics freak, and I was more than pleased with how Robots looked. I saw it at IMAX, was on the front row, and was simply amazed by the insanely amazing quality. Other than that, everything was more than forgettable. I really wonder what the script said. Maybe ""Insert clichéd and overdone plot here."" (Spoiler, although you could probably guess the ending anyway) I mean, the little guy going against the big evil guy and winning, gee, I haven't seen that one before. (End spoiler) As for the humor, I only laughed at two parts (if you see the film, look for the signs on the bathroom door and what's left of the lightpost when he passes out, they're the only truly clever parts of the movie) and the the rest of the time I was mostly groaning. I don't find humor in farts, I dunno why but I find it disgusting, go figure. And when Ratchet randomly plugs Britney Spears by bursting into ""Oops...I Did it Again"" I cringed. The full minute when Rodney finally arrives in the big city WAS funny, but you could see that clip on the internet so I had seen it before. Moral of the Story: Great for visuals and kids, adults will roll their eyes...unless they're pretty kid-like themselves (FYI, not an insult)."
193,Robots,7,17 March 2005,the children will screech of delight,"This is a nice and simple story, so well polished that it shines. The moral of the story is like a greasing that simply slides by all the cynical layers we adults may have. No one will be thrown as junk, no matter if they are covered in rust, you should never give up your dream, if you're good then you will be rewarded and capitalism is pure evil... In Metropolis-aesthetic has someones imagination has had fun beyond all boundaries. All the adult humor or irony has been cut down, cause Robots is a movie whose metal heart belongs to the children. Robots will get all the children to screech of delight. Especially when these colorful metal men tumbles around like candy in a bag."
194,Robots,7,10 March 2005,Had Potential....,"I got to see this movie in a prescreening, unfortunately I didn't see it in English, but fortunately for me I wasn't looking forward to hearing Robin Williams coffee-high antics for an hour and a half. I did like him in Aladdin but from the trailers I think this would have been in the too much Robin Williams zone.As for the movie, it looks amazing, I guess the main reason for this was the decision to make the movie a ""Robots"" movie, thus making the whole process of rendering and texturing a whole lot easier and just having almost everything made out of metal made the look of the film very realistic. So that's a point in favor of the movie. And the standards for todays CG animations are in place, even the ""themed settings"" are there, we've seen a toys world, a bugs world, a fairytale world, a superhero world, a monster world & underwater worlds... so now we have a Robot world filled with metal detectors, street performers doing ""the robot"", cup of oil instead of cup of coffee and a whole set of robotic and mechanical parts replacing human organs. So it seems we've stumbled into a patter, but it hasn't bothered me before so just lets see where this movie takes us. Well it's not a bad movie but it just doesn't give us anything new and it suffers in the joke department the way Shark Tale suffered, it was to forced, it's like the creators are going, LOOK... they are doing something and its FUNNY, except that it is not, sure there are some nice moments, some that make you laugh, a little chuckle here and there but the rest just made me confused whether it was meant to be funny or not. There's also the music factor which also affected Shark Tale, they abuse the number of song they include in the movie, its like if its a little popular we can include the song somewhere in the film, from Walkie Talkie Man and Low Rider to some James Brown song and several HipHop hits, I'm surprised SirMix-a-lots ""Big Butts"" wasn't in the movie (especially since one of the characters does have a bit butt), I guess DreamWorks must have the rights to that song. There's even a totally unnecessary sequence where Robin Williams character does this Britney Dance to fight other robots, this clearly is an example of what I was saying in both forcedly trying to make something funny and including a song (and in this case a more known pop-reference). I could have let all this slide if it there was at least some decent story line, not even the characters are all that memorable, in conclusion I think they tried to hard.The things I liked in the movie where some very dynamic sequences involving Robotic Transit(even if it defied Laws of Gravity & Nature) that I think would be very fun at an IMAX showing (or very nauseating), as the title said the film had potential for much more, more story, more endearing characters, an even meaner villain (and a better excuse to go against him).. even the jokes had potential but they where not fully carried out, like the Robots doing the robot.. at the end, a robot town is seen celebrating and dancing, if they would've shown more of them doing ""The Robot"" or everyone doing it in unison, it could have been funnier.I gave it a 7 (out of 10 in the IMDb)"
195,Robots,5,5 August 2005,"Without Robin Williams, This movie is absolute garbage.","Honestly I can't believe the minimum amount of humour throughout this movie. I mean they could've tried to make it a little funnier with giving characters some funny lines, but Robin Williams was the only one here that was trying to make it funny & make it last the 80 minutes of torture. The main reason why this movie fails is not because of the animation which I thought was brilliant its because it's all been done before by Disney like a million times, its too much of a family movie with Mel Brooks making the most useless character appearance of his movie life as Bigweld the founder of Robot City, trust me its a short movie but will drag on for long. Let's also get one thing straight, all these movies i'm about to list are a lot better than this. The Incredibles, Shrek 1 & 2, Iceage, even Shark Tale is so much better, so if your expecting a great animated that I would advise you to stay clear of this garbage. I am going to give this a 5 / 10. I won't recommend this to many people, but watch it for Robin Williams."
196,Robots,10,18 April 2005,Fantastic,"I have always been the designated ""animated movie"" taxi cab driver. my now ex-wife never cared for cartoons of any kind so that ""chore"" has always fallen to me. Fortunately I love cartoon so it has given me an excuse to watch a type of film I love anyway. I took my 9 year old to see Robots and was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The acting was wonderful, Robin Williams isn't as over the top as when he portrayed Genie in Aladdin but he still gets off enough one liners to make it worth the price of admission. The story is good and the action is almost non-stop. One easy way for an adult to judge how good an animated flick is .. how long did the movie ""seem"" to take? I've sat through animated flicks that were 90 minutes long and seemed to take ages to finally come to a close... The action in Robots is so fast paced I was shocked at how quick we were out of the place. Now I have a suggestion for anyone who has the opportunity. Recently a co-worker told me about the local IMAX theater and how great it was when he took his grandchildren to see movies there. If there is an IMAX near you I strongly recommend taking in this film on THAT screen. AT 5 stories high you actually feel like your inside the movie itself and it just makes the total experience much more fun."
197,Robots,4,15 April 2005,Kids love it. I yawned.,"Often in computer-animated films, it seems that the intention of the filmmakers is to dazzle us with visuals that would simply be impossible to realize or create any other way. That works when the story is also filled with heart, and the environment in which the characters populate has at least some reality.""Robots"" has none of that. It comes across as a Pixar wannabe, but fails miserably. Perhaps the creators hoped that we would be entertained by celebrity voices, but even that is tiresome. Robin Williams has done marvelous films over the years, and his voice worked perfectly in Disney's ""Aladdin."" Here, it is not funny, but is merely mildly appealing.It was fun to hear Mel Brooks again; I will give the movie that. But his portions are not that much. Ewan McGregor's voice is wasted on this. His talent really shines in the more recent ""Star Wars"" films. In ""Robots"" he is practically unrecognizable.Children will love ""Robots"". My kids did. On the other hand, I almost fell asleep in several portions. I was not impressed. I did not see a magical world that seemed astounding like the underwater settings of ""Finding Nemo."" This looks more like someone hoped to create splendor in a junkyard."
198,Robots,9,13 April 2005,Machines With Heart,"""Robots"" is the latest animated feature from Chris Wedge and Blue Sky Studios, the force behind ""Ice Age."" The story is set in a world entirely of mechanical beings. The main character, Rodney Copperbottom, is a young idealistic small-town robot who travels to the big city to become an inventor. There, he winds up battling a corrupt force, and joining a ragtag gang of broken-down robots in fighting for the common folk. The animation is stunning, particularly on the roller-coaster/pinball machine mechanics of the Robot City public transport system. There are many fine voice performances, such as Mel Brooks as the avuncular Big Weld, Greg Kinnear as the sharklike Ratchet, and Robin William's hilarious routine as Fender. Some of the humor may not be appropriate for younger viewers. But all will be dazzled by the final product."
199,Robots,4,9 April 2005,b-o-r-i-n-g,"I just saw this movie and what a bore-fest it was. As is typical with Dreamworks, the film tries to satirize pop culture, but it fails to reach the pinnacle the studio reached with the two Shrek films. This movie was terribly uninteresting. Except with a few exceptions, the jokes were old and used (""I know this town like the back of my hand- hey, that's new"" -Robin Williams). The tried and used Shakespearian formula of totally controlling mom/wife controlling son/husband is put to use here, with very little good effect. Rachet's lines must have been written by two different people who never saw what the other was doing, because in one scene he know exactly what to do and in another he seems to forget that and has to have his mom tell him what to do. Halle Berry seems to just be reading her lines, with no hint of emotion anywhere to be found.The bright spots (as rare as they may be): Paul Giamatti is hilarious as the security guard robot, and the backdrop of Robot City is very well put together. In all, a boring film, but if you have kids, see it, because they will probably laugh at all the farting jokes and funny noise jokes. 4 out of 10."
200,Robots,9,2 April 2005,Absolutely Wonderful Entertainment for All,"This was enormous fun and exactly what I was expecting. Clever mechanicals, beautiful drawings and lots laughs. What more do you expect from a cartoon? I laughed a lot, once to tears, and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Of course one of the terrific things about this movie is that it works for adults and children. I was so disappointed with Sponge Bob, (not having seen the TV show) expecting a movie that bridged the adult child cultural gap. But where Bob fell short Robots really delivers.As I mentioned, the drawing is terrific and the writing is hilarious, but Robin Williams shtick added real spice to this movie. And while Greg Kinnear was fine as the evil Ratchet, I kept thinking of Jim Carey for that role, oh well."
201,Robots,10,29 March 2005,"Watch out, Pixar...","Pixar had better watch out, because Blue Sky Productions is quickly making a name for themselves in the movie industry. It all started with a little film a few years ago called Ice Age. Pretty big hit, great film, etc. Until now though, Blue Sky was all but forgotten. This movie changes that. Filled with great state-of-the-art animation, hilarious jokes and great acting by the likes of Robin Williams, Ewan McGregor and other well-known folks, this movie is by far the best computer-animated film yet. If you liked Ice Age, you'll love this. Even if you didn't like Ice Age, if you like any of the Pixar films, you'll love this. Great film, definitely worth seeing."
202,Robots,4,22 March 2005,Best parts of movie in the trailers... don't waste your money,"I was excited about Robots after seeing the theatrical trailers. Robin Williams is in a class by himself when it comes to comedians. But Williams character was a minor character with not much dialog in the movie. In fact, all of the good parts of the movie were in the theatrical trailers.Robots did not live up to the hype. It wasn't a *bad* movie. It was just unengaging and boring. It never connected. Frankly you could have tossed the main character in the furnace at the end instead of the evil character, and I wouldn't have cared.All I wanted was for the movie to end.If you want to see a GREAT animated feature, then rent The Incredibles.4 out of 10 because it was so boring and never connects with the audience."
203,Robots,,11 March 2005,"Started good, then ran out of gas","I just saw Robots with my nieces, and was surprised at how much I was liking it from the beginning. Although I didn't care for Robin Williams, because he wasn't creating a character, he was just Robin Williams. The film was clichéd but most animated films are. But the journey was interesting. Until Rodney tracks down Bigweld. Then all of the sudden the film spirals down into an uninteresting climax which felt totally out of place with the rest of the film. It was like that's as far as they had gotten with a script and had to hurry up and finish it in order to make a deadline. Instead of hiring big name actors to play small voice over parts, they should have used the money for development first. Kids aren't going to the movie to hear Halle Berry or Amanda Bynes. They're going to see Robots. Parents aren't going to refuse to take the kids if the voices of Greg Kinnear and Drew Carey aren't in the movie. You could actually hire trained voice talent for the movie and save several million bucks. And idiotic modern references to Brittany Spears means nothing to a 4 year old, and will mean even less when they see the film in 5 years. The same goes for the Singing In The Rain reference. The majority of your audience born in the mid 70's and bringing their kids to the movies will have no idea what Singing In The Rain is. Only film geeks or film students will get it. So instead of being lazy (or paying homage as today's film makers call it), be original and stand out among all the other animated films. So far Pixar is the only company being completely original. Chris Wedge and his gang showed promise with Ice Age and the first half of Robots, but it felt like some thirty-something execs with business degrees from the local U, had too much input in the creation of the film."
204,Robots,,11 March 2005,All i got to say is Whew.,"I mean there was this robot and then wham there was like more of them...... I couldn't believe it. Flying cages and then there were ROBOTS! Yea man, you can go there with this stuff, you know what I'm saying? Its all over the map.Whak a Mack dig I Dole. That what this movie was like. Stuff in this film was all big and scary, then there was a car. Ohhhhh so many cars. Wow they fly and muffle actress the screen and ROBOTS! It was like stepping into the future for about like the length of the movie. Ya know how long that is? Its about how long the movie was. I wonder if robots would like stomp on us in the future and squish us so flat it would like hurt bad."
205,Robots,4,24 April 2005,definitely not Pixar,"I was certainly hoping for more. I didn't hate the film, but I felt it lacked many key elements that come standard in Pixar's lineup. The story was okay. The characters were okay. The animation was okay. But nothing was outstanding. It felt rushed in every area. I wasn't moved by much in Robots...in fact, I can't recall the main character's first name (much less most of the minor characters). The star-studded cast ends up being the draw to a film that doesn't deliver. From my understanding, this was not a Dreamworks film. However, it had a feel similar to Antz and Shark Tale: both falling well short of the mark of being a classic. Pixar, on the other hand, has Disneyesque storytelling that is firmly backed by strongly developed characters, a notable cast, and incredible animation that pushes the envelope. Admitedly, I did laugh at a couple of scenes/ gags in Robots, but overall I left feeling somewhat disappointed."
206,Robots,5,12 March 2005,Predictable and Forgettable,"I wasn't expecting much from ""Robots"". In fact, I only decided to see it because I was with someone else who wanted to.While the visual effects are great, it is what you should expect from a CG movie. Not nearly as spectacular as the 3 big CG movies of 2004. This film might have been better had it been released prior to ""The Incredibles."" The action scenes in ""Robots"" are very well done, but still lack compared to those in ""Incredibles."" In ""Robots,"" the characters are cute, and the outcome is very predictable.It is Robin Williams who saves the movie. His vocal expressions really shine through the ""Fender"" character whom he portrays. Amanda Bynes does a great job with the voice of Piper, while the rest of the characters are, like the movie, forgettable.5 out of 10 stars...and not a movie I'll care to see again, even on DVD. Fox still ranks a distant third behind Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks in the CG department."
207,Robots,5,11 March 2005,You might loose your nuts & bolts in the mid-section!!!,"Okay - seriously , I had been looking forward to being able to take my son to see this movie for weeks after watching the trailers online with him. I must say the animation this film is superb. There really is good character development in the first part of the movie to spark your interest and create the illusion that this is gonna be a great movie...but, hold your breath...you may be in for the ride of your life! The movie looses it's momentum rather early on and I actually felt dizzy and nauseated during the entire main part of the film. The best parts are the opening scenes, and the adorable happy ending!!! Boy was I happy when the movie was over!!! If only they could've designed a Robot that could edit the entire 45 minutes in the middle of this scrap pile celluloid junk!!! Yep - make your kids happy - take them to see robots - they will probably love it - but you have been warned - do not see this movie on an full stomach. If you are pregnant, prone to dizziness or motion sickness - you might want to skip it."
208,Robots,,11 March 2005,Grow some bolts!,"as it is quite noticeable, Robots is meant for the younger audience. and it shows. the entire length of the movie is one big mechanical pun. everything has to do with robots, nuts, bolts, gears, ratchets, wrenches, and basically any and all electronic or mechanical item. while cute and rather funny at first this begins to become annoying. luckily, thats not all there is to it. while a bit weak on the plot side, the characters and their interaction with each other is great. when each character meets another there is an initial reaction and later, once they get to know each other, they gather a new perception of the person...robot, whatever. in other words, they're just like real people, so i guess that could be good or bad. however, some character interaction could have been done better. for example; Fender is worried about his younger sister Piper so he tells her to stay where she is and not get hurt. this would be interesting character development if it went anywhere. they never actually expand on it besides the fact that Piper shows up to help anyway. besides those comment the movie was quite good. the characters were likable (except Halle Berry's character who was pointless), the setting (Robot City) was magnificent, the humor was pretty funny without trying to be dirty, and Robin Williams actually didn't steal (or try to steal) the show. so if you do go see it, just try to remember that its a kids movie and if you don't like it, that's probably why. ha, just wait till you see Aunt Fanny let it rip!"
209,Robots,,11 March 2005,Not necessarily for kids,"This may or may not ""spoil"" the movie, but there are a few too many lightly veiled sexual comments in this movie for me to be comfortable recommending it to parents of younger children. It was a great movie, but with comments like, ""...the Brazilian Wax...it's like a party everyday!"" and something (I can't remember the wording) about the fact that Fender and Rodney would be spending the night together...Honestly, I draw the line at sexual references, especially the ones that get a giggle out of the audience, because the kids are going to ask why something is funny...and do you really want to explain why you (or the rest of the audience) laughed at something like that to your 5 or 6 year old?"
210,Robots,1,24 November 2007,Rated R for rotten,"The movie ""Robots"" is incredibly stupid retarded and dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, and dumb. This movie is an attempt by the Hollyweird vulgarians to indoctrinate kids in their type of humor, evident by the fact that ""Robots"" is loaded with sexual innuendos, suggestive jokes, and some bad language, and the fact that 20th Century Fox is also the same studio that makes the Simpsons, King of the Hill, and Malcolm in the Middle, which are also rated TVPG, just like this movie. Animated movies are becoming increasingly like the Simpsons and Family Guy. Just about every animated movie out there has at least one innuendo. By the way, I wonder who controls Hollywood? Don't let the fact that 20th Century Fox runs Fox News fool you. 20th Century Fox is NOT a conservative (or a family-friendly) film company. This is the same film company that made the global warming propaganda movie ""The Day After Tomorrow."" This movie also has its PC themes. Corporate America is evil. Mass-marketing is evil. Sound familiar? All of the animated movies today stink to one degree or another. If you want something that's family friendly and does not have anything crude or vulgar about it, stay away from this one, lest you want your kids using the same jokes they use in this movie.Rated PG for brief language and suggestive humor."
211,Robots,3,21 May 2015,Trash Heap.,"Robots (2005): Dir: Chris Wedge / Voices: Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Robin Williams, Greg Kinnear, Amanda Bynes: Computer generated family fare about creation and ability. Rodney Copperbottom leaves home in pursuit of presenting his ideas to Robot City only to discover it is taken over by the evil Ratchet who upgrades robots leaving those robots that are unable to afford fixing to be destroyed. Dreary plot travels formula with a mindless climax centred around violence. Directed by Chris Wedge who previously made Ice Age. Voice talents are totally flat and add little or no personality to otherwise weak characterizations. Ewan McGregor voices Rodney who is the typical hero. There is nothing interesting about him. Halle Berry whose female robot serves only as a potential romance. How robots achieve this is something best left unexplored. Robin Williams voices the dismantling Fender in what amounts to his typical nightclub act, which is far more entertaining and certainly funnier than this. Greg Kinnear voices the standard villain Ratchet who seems modelled after hundreds of other villains. Amanda Bynes plays fender's younger sister, which makes one wonder how that is even possible. There might have been potential here but it seems lost within its flimsy writing. Visual images are exquisite with their electronic city and factories but the screenplay needs major repairs. Score: 3 / 10"
212,Robots,5,17 November 2014,"It could be really great, but...","Robots has flawless and detailed animation, excellent voice acting from all characters, and decent-enough soundtrack... so why am I only rating it 5/10? Well, it's the huge level of crude humor, which takes over the whole movie to the point where it just gets disgusting and stupid. If you're an adult and you love crude humor, sex jokes and fart noises, well by all means that's your decision. But this is listed as a kid's movie, and no matter how you want to raise your children and what you allow them to see, there were things in this movie that were certainly not appropriate for its intended audience.Right away, Robots starts off with a few ""baby-making"" jokes (you'll see what I mean if you decide to watch it). I'm not some kind of prude, many movies have one or two crude humor jokes in them, but Robots takes it WAY too far as it goes on, from ""Aunt Phanny"" (an obese robot who constantly passes gas) to repeated scenes of a dog trying to take a leak on a fire hydrant.It's really too bad, because Robin Williams really did a great voice job, as did Jim Broadbent (who surprisingly voiced a female character!) and it did have some funny moments, such as the scene where the ugly old antagonist gives her son a photo for his desk at work, a photograph of her framed in a plastic pink heart shape with the words, ""world's best mom"" on the top.I think that Robots had a ton of potential, but sadly this is one of those movies that just got wrecked with nasty, pervy jokes and fart noises. I can't honestly say I could ever recommend it to anybody."
213,Robots,1,4 July 2014,Decent animation ruined by Robin Williams,"The story is not bad, a robot world with heroes, sidekicks and dastardly villains. I had hoped for more meaningful animation. The heroes look like junk and the villains look like bad jokes. Most of the best bits were stolen from other movies and music. Did any of the bots have a purpose? Lots of famous voices overshadowed by Robin Williams' obnoxious over the top performance. Lots of potential squashed by dopey design and half baked concept. I blame the writers and director but there was so much gone wrong that the producer has to shoulder much of this failure. Let's chalk it up to poor execution and shoddy oversight to let this abomination see the light of day. It is easy to compare this to ""Meet The Robinson's"" but the comparison is far from fair. Let's just say that if you like this, your standards are very low and please see more quality animation where story meets art and characters like Dory and Rusty teach us entertaining lessons."
214,Robots,6,16 November 2013,Kinda cute but not that funny,"Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) is a son of a dish washing robot but he wants to be a big inventor for his hero Bigweld (Mel Brooks). Only BigWeld industries is taken over by the evil Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) who wants to phase out the older models and concentrate on selling upgrades. Rodney befriends Fender (Robin Williams), Piper (Amanda Bynes), and a gang of outmoded robots.It's a visually exuberant movie, but it's not that funny. As hard as Robin Williams tries, his manic voice work doesn't add any humor. That's the biggest issue with this movie. The shinny robots, the kinetic style, and the manic mannerisms make a potentially wacky movie, but none of it makes it funny. They should have asked Mel Brooks to help write some jokes for this movie rather than make him do voice work. It definitely needed some."
215,Robots,,14 July 2012,"Nowhere near appropriate, even though i'm trying to like Blue Sky!","When it comes to wise-asses at Blue Sky Studios, i highly doubt this film is general enough for kids aged 5-12, This might be a bit of a spoiler, but i did see rather inappropriate scenes, some of the characters have a huge bum and say 'Crap', We see someone s*** themselves, they fart their heart out, they pull their pants down, and of course it has very unreliable violence. I Know Wedge and Saldanha are doing whatever they can to fulfil their destiny, but i don't at all find their films funny, I'm determined to watch Rio (2011) later this year and of course Epic (2013) Next Year, but i'm beginning to hate this film, It's nowhere near general, I Agree with it having a PG but i'm a little unaware of it's ideas, Such as an obese robot creating everything, or maybe even a dishwasher for a father, It's Crazy!And if your watching this Wedge (Or Saldanha, i don't mind) I will prosecute you both, i apologise for your wacky ideas and 'Ice Age' Triumph, BTW Congrats on the Oscar for 'Bunny' ^^"
216,Robots,3,2 May 2012,An average animated film,"The bar for animated films is very high what with the Shrek franchise from Dreamworks and all the wonderful films that Pixar continue to produce so Robots has to work hard to try and match them. And while it makes a good attempt it will never topple these films as being the best example of an animated film.All the hallmarks of good animated family films are there - it's visually interesting, it has a good heart and humour while also boasting the now obligatory all star cast that all animated films seem to need but the overall story seems to be lacking so we don't invest as much love into the characters as we do with say Buzz or Woody. Children of a young age will no doubt enjoy it but the adults who are watching it with them may find themselves sneaking a look at the running time on the back of the DVD and seeing how much longer there is to go.The team at BlueSky (who also did the Ice Age films) do an awful lot right with this film but it hasn't been remembered as fondly as some of the others that have been released in the same time period."
217,Robots,3,19 February 2011,Mishmosh of random characters and outdated cultural jokes,"In spite of the child-friendly PG rating, Robots feels more like a poor attempt to mimic Pixar's success at making adult friendly cartoons.The cultural reference jokes are odd picks clearly made by older higher-ups who never bothered to check what decade it was. The protagonist robots are designed to look like 1950s appliances, Britney Spears song was already seven years out of date in 2005 and Madame Gasket's shop does a poor theft of Broadway's 'Stomp' but the plot is not nearly enough to interest the adult viewers this film was clearly trying to attract.The characters are unlikeable at best and largely irrelevant. We never stick with any long enough to find out anything about them. They appear, say one or two lines and then disappear for ten or fifteen minutes at a time. Robin Williams' Fender is the same fast-talking character Williams does in every Disney movie which may amuse some children but is quickly irritating as almost every scene mid-movie revolves around him shouting about something. The rest of the voices, mostly by B-list actors, are largely forgettable.The same could be said for the plot. I'm still not sure what the moral message is supposed to be. Follow your dreams? Be yourself? Anti-capitalism? It can't seem to settle on one so all we have are a bunch of disjointed scenes smashed together. Rodney wants to follow his dreams, instead ends up paired up with a bunch of vigilante-esque 'Outmodes' fighting against the capitalist industry that wants them to 'Upgrade' into fancier robots. The characters fight and dislike each other through most of the film, even stealing each other's parts out of desperation, then are forced together for the big finale which feels incredibly artificial.My six year old seems to enjoy it, perhaps because it's colorful and requires no attention span so I'll give it 3 stars instead of 1."
218,Robots,5,7 February 2010,Looks good but the story is quite bland,"When I started to watch this film I immediately liked to look of it; while it is obviously animated it did not look cartoony, this was probably because nothing was overly shiny but had a matt texture. The animation was good although some scenes felt like they were there just to show off what could be done with the technology. An example of this it the city transport system which while looking impressive and being imaginative doesn't have any logic to it; it seemed that once the creators had thought to have a transport system like the game ""Mouse Trap"" they just thought of more and more ingenious ways to move the characters without thinking why the system was so convoluted leaving the scene feeling over long.The story itself is good enough, a young robot sets off to Robot City where he hopes to be an inventor working Bigweld, head of the robot parts company; however when he gets there it turns out that Bigweld has been usurped by the evil Ratchet who plans to stop providing spare parts and concentrate on selling expensive upgrades. Robots that are needing repair but can't afford the upgrades will be recycled. Our hero, Rodney Copperbottom, sets about trying to find Bigweld to help get rid of Ratchet, he also annoys Ratchet by repairing robots that would otherwise be recycled.It wasn't a bad film and I'm sure youngsters will be impressed with the visuals although parents might not be so impressed with the fact that some of the jokes in the film are somewhat crude. The voice acting was good enough although the only voice I recognised was Robin Williams, although that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'd not bother buying this film or watching it a second time on television; with its pop culture references I feel it will age faster than the dilapidated robots in the film."
219,Robots,6,5 September 2009,Signs of the times,"This movie is probably the saddest I've seen in a while. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was ruined to this extent. I've seen worse movies, of course, but I have never seen such a mix of such clever, fun entertainment with such sheer Hollywood trash. This film shines in its action sequences and its design--I, a reputed animation buff/nerd couldn't be happier with its looks. However, its story's potential was lost because of some quite obvious, fundamental flaws. All of the hilarious, personality-filled Buster Keaton and Marx Bros. antics of the Rusties are overshadowed by the crude humor that plagues our day and age. All of the fun stuff is equally balanced with sheer boredom and nastiness. The fundamental problem, though, was the contradiction in the story department. This movie, I think, scared Blue Sky to death. ""Be yourself"" would offend FAR too many upper-Hollywood types, even though it had great potential for a movie. So what do they do? Instead of following through with the natural progression of their story, they have the ""pretty girl"" be among the upgrades. Cappy--her lack of acting and personality--as well as the directors' unwillingness to follow through on their premise doomed this movie to an early grave. All of the fun of sneaking into the Bigweld Ball, the mouse-trap-like ride through town, and, of course, ""Singin' in the Oil"" was dragged down into quagmire by the unwillingness of the directors/producers/etc. to tell the story that this wanted to tell. All in all, this movie is worth watching--just not all the way through. Certain sequences are clever and fun, and others just aren't worth the thirty or forty minutes it takes. Be glad for DVD scene selections."
220,Robots,4,31 December 2008,Robin Williams?,"So Robin Williams got another animated roll besides Aladdin. Is it the next Aladding? Well obviously not, but at least it tries to have a story line. However, it does not succeed in much in this effort.This is a CGI robot world with its own characters. Mechanics are what doctors are to humans. Spare parts are always sort after and upgrades are sent when somebody gets older. Anyway, some sort of odd plot is hatched where you can't get any spare parts and have to buy entirely new bodies.Its a nicely done piece of CGI. But nothing else can be said of the effort. Yes they got some nice talent, but the script didn't have a lot in terms of emotional appeal except a father who needed new spare parts and an overachieving son.Overall, they could have done better. ""C-"""
221,Robots,6,1 November 2008,Showcases nothing already seen.,"Robots (2005, Dir. Chris Wedge) Life isn't that great in the Copperbottom family. Rodney (McGregor) keeps failing in getting his ideas noticed, and his father, Herb (Tucci) struggles with work and himself. In order to get his idea noticed and to make his parents proud, Rodney sets out to Robot City to showcase his idea to Bigweld (Brooks). At Robot City, Bigweld is nowhere to be seen, as Rodney and his new friends start to suspect a terrible reason why.Although its boasts an amazing selection of cast voices, there is nothing in 'Robots' which hasn't already been seen in other animated films. Can be fun to watch, but if you're expecting something as good as other popular animated movies, then you will be disappointed.All right, break time.All right, break time's over.  Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent)"
222,Robots,6,1 January 2008,Not a bad Disney flick,"****EXTREMELY MILD SPOILERS**** I happened to catch this movie twice as a marathon of it aired Christmas Eve. Don't let my fairly low rating of it veer you away - it is a very cute flick, and has lots of moments for both kids and adults alike.Here's what I liked: Very awesome animationThere's always something interesting going on in the background of the movie. You'll see something new every time you watch it.Good voice acting; I was especially fond of Mel Brooks, Robin Williams, and Dylan and Will Denton as Mr. Bigweld, Fender, and Rodney.Interesting characters - though I felt only Rodney, Mr. Bigweld, and the villain set in this got decent background story, what we did get was touching and generally inspired empathy (not in the villains, though, of course). I was especially fond of Mr. Bigweld. ;D Decent plot, though it's not without the occasional moment of ""Why did they do that?"". Things I wasn't so fond of: Honestly, I expected Rodney to end up with Piper. With Rodney ending up with the beautiful, updated robot Cappy instead, it reduced Piper to the little sister/occasional player in the movie role. I also was left slightly unsettled by the message it was sending.Speaking of messages I didn't like, though the theme ended up being ""Accept people as they are"", I felt there was something a little more to it. Perhaps I was reading too much into a kid's flick, but honestly, the second time around, I was left with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth, feeling that the message instead had more of a political flair to it. Why, you ask?: There was no mention of another country or anything beyond mentioning Rodney's small hometown. However, I felt the message ended up being ""No matter how annoying, stubborn, or backward others are, accept them as they are"". Every robot could have upgraded, but one line from Fender told us they 'couldn't afford it'. Yes, the villains were somewhat despicable from many middle and lower-class viewpoints, but overall, their plan was to streamline society, and get everyone on the same page, if you will. They were despicable in how they were rounding up all the 'outmodes' to melt down for scrap, but we aren't given much of an indication how long this situation had been going on in the robot world to be able to make a firm judgment, though it does feel like it had been a few years. I found it very difficult to put my finger on, but it definitely felt...off, like the studio had an agenda, past just making this appealing to the target audience.Some of the other characters can be slightly annoying at times, and it definitely has some nauseatingly sappy moments. Bottom line? This movie is a pretty good example of the newer American animation films, and definitely for all ages. Some other reviewer was complaining about innuendo and a fart joke, but it's pretty mild. Worth getting to complete a collection, and DEFINITELY worth taking the time to catch this heart-warming movie when it airs on cable/satellite."
223,Robots,5,25 December 2007,Gorgeous but empty,"When the film first began, I was bowled over by how visually stunning this film was. Considering it was made by the same studio (Fox) that had recently made the ICE AGE films, I was not expecting such exquisite graphics. Now I am not putting down ICE AGE or its sequel, but they just didn't look as beautifully rendered as the Dreamworks and Pixar computer generated films. Considering that Fox came into the full-length C.G. game later, I can understand this but in ROBOTS they have shown that at least visually they are on par or perhaps even better than rival studios--it was THAT nice.Unfortunately, while Fox spared no expense on graphics, when it comes to the story, the film came up very short. Most of this is because the story itself seemed so ordinary and filled with clichés--making it a very formulaic film. Plus, unfortunately, none of the characters are especially compelling or interesting--including the plucky lead. They all seemed like characters recycled from many other recent kids movies (such as the plucky and under-appreciated girl). Plus, while many out there no doubt would disagree with me, I DON'T particularly love Robin Williams--his character comes on very strong and takes away from the charm of the story. In many ways, he was so loud and so ""in your face"" in many scenes that other characters seemed to get lost. To me, the performance was a lot like a very precious 6 year-old who is encouraged to perform for company--enough already!So overall, the film is gorgeous to look at but very empty and forgettable otherwise. Despite its amazing look, it turns out to be just another kids movie and nothing more. With so many C.G. movies in recent years, this one gets lost in the crowd and doesn't rank among the better films of this type.PS--While many out there have never played any of the Ratchet and Clank games for the Playstation systems, this movie looked almost exactly like many of the robot worlds from this game. To people like me who have played and loved the games, you will no doubt be excited by the look of Robot City."
224,Robots,6,12 May 2007,Just good,"And it's a shame because it could've been better. If you listen to the audio commentary/interviews from the creators, where they tell that there were many Robin Williams takes, they couldn't use, because they were not suitable for young children, you also wish, they would've put them on the DVD then ...But other than my Special Features wishes, this movie doesn't take any chances and stays on a very known path. It does a good job with the story, the dialogues are good (kudos to the voice cast) and the animation is nicely done. The mix of characters is good too, but it still seems to be missing something. Something most Pixar movies have and other animation studios try to achieve. Most of them can't come close. At least this is one of the better attempts!"
225,Robots,4,30 November 2006,"Slick, unsurprising fun","No shocks, no disappointments. It's a classic family cartoon (made with CGI) with good guys, bad guys, a vaguely Hudsucker Proxy meets Wizard of Oz plot and the requisite postmodern asides, even for the kids ('yes we know you know it's a surreal cartoon' etc.).There's plenty of invention in translating human attributes across to machines but that's where the invention ends. The film is purely a vehicle for its star voiceovers and CGI wizardry. For the latter, a laurel or two although I wasn't quite so ready to buy into the voicework: Robin Williams especially has a tendency to modulate the volume of his projection so wildly as to render many lines inaudible (sic an actor error, not production). One for the under 12s while you do the tax return. 4/10"
226,Robots,5,16 May 2006,nice to look at but offers little of interest,"Despite its clean and shiny look, its stellar cast of voices and its expert animation, ""Robots"" offers little to interest the adult audience. Set in a world made up entirely of mechanical creatures, the film tells the tale of a young robot named Rodney Copperbottom who leaves home to find fame and fortune in the Big Bad City. Once there, he discovers that a major manufacturing company has decided to stop making affordable replacement parts for the robots of the world, instead forcing them to either pay for expensive upgrades or face annihilation in the city's infamous chop shop. Soon, Rodney and his new assorted pals are taking on the villain and taking a stand for oppressed robots every where.In addition to its rather trite and hackneyed storyline, the screenplay lacks the sharp humor and satirical edge of the ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story"" movies, relying instead on a series of uninspired double entendres - and a plethora of flatulence jokes - that seem a trifle inappropriate in a film aimed mainly at young children. The movie does have a nice Oz-like, art deco look to it, which at least gives the viewer something to watch while the story ever so slowly spins itself out. The list of well-know actors providing voice-over work here is a long and distinguished one, though, frankly, the only performer I really recognized was Robin Williams. Too bad they weren't given material worthy of their time or talents."
227,Robots,3,20 April 2006,Sigh.. Pixar has spoiled the rest.,I guess the bar has been raised so far by Pixar that some of these other animated movies are just plain boring. It might be that Pixar writes their own software but eh quality of image and detail is lacking in this movie. It's like something someone would do in college while they were still learning.I think I was amused about twice in the entire movie. The script just wasn't up to par and I found myself drifting off and thinking about other things. It's a shame that Robin Williams was in this. He was worth the 3 points I gave it.I'm glad I waited until it was on the satellite dish or I'd want a refund... ; )
228,Robots,5,4 April 2006,The same story once again...,"i think that ""Robots"" has to be judged from several points of view: THE TECHNICAL) Well, technically the movie is amazing, the perfection of the animations is just overbearing... THE ARTISTIC) Excellent, the ""Robots"" universe is so creative and so imaginative, that city full of mechanical stuff... Now, if we talk about the story, the script, etc., we can do anything but say that this story is the same we've watched in dozens of movies of like this (""Finding Nemo"" and so...): good against evil, the working class hero, etc. It's beginning to be a little bit reiterative, isn't it? So they are all those references to classics of cinema. In short, ""Robots"" has nothing to do against the best animation comedy ever: The Shrek. *My rate: 5/10"
229,Robots,,3 April 2006,A different follow up from Blue Sky,"From the team that made Ice Age possible.Robots is taken place in a fictional robot world. Everything is mechanical and artificial.The story revolves on Rodney Copperbottom a regular robot who was inspired by a TV show with Big Weld(a famous robot who make repairs and ideas possible for other robots). Rodney decides to become an inventor like Big Weld himself.When Rodney is a fully functional robot, he leaves his home and travels to the big City where Big Weld's company is. Little does he know that there's been changes there for sometime.Robots is a good movie. Different from Ice Age, but still good. Has more voice talents in it including: Ewan McGreger, Robin Williams, Amada Bynes, Drew Carey, Halle Barry, Mel Brooks, etc.It's rated PG for mild humor, and a scene involving making fart noises.Those who like Ice Age might like this one. Rent it first if you're not too sure about it."
230,Robots,6,10 January 2006,"Robots is a decent movie, but no more than that, as it's plot is too limited for it to be a great movie.","Robots is a movie which is a little unique, but only for the fact that it is an animated film which is about robots and set in a robotic city, a concept which I don't remember seeing before. As a movie, it is sound, but not what you would call great. Ditto the animation. It's good, but still not great.The plot revolves around an aspiring inventor who is stuck in a small town. He wants to 'be somebody', so he goes to Robot City. However, this doesn't turn out as well as he hoped. Worse, there's trouble back home. He is on the verge of giving up, but fights back and wins the day. Pretty by-the-numbers stuff.However, Robots is still watchable; indeed, it is often quite entertaining, even if it relies too heavily on butt, fart and gender jokes more than it really should. Still, it is quite comical to see Aunt Fanny's (guess why she's called that) fart cause an earthquake around Robot City and there are one or two witty one-liners (""It's a mixture of jazz and funk! Junk!"" and ""Lady, get a doctor!"").It has to be said that one or two of the actors and actresses do quite funny voiceovers; for example, the manic Fender (Robin Williams) or the speechless dog-like robot, however, most are merely OK.The animation, like I said, is good; more polished looking than Shark Tale, but still not up to Pixar's standard. It's just that Pixar seems more-polished and easier on the eye.In conclusion, Robots is a decent movie, but no more than that, as it's plot is too limited for it to be a great movie. It's strongest suit is undoubtedly the fact that it boasts an entirely robotic world.3/5 stars"
231,Robots,6,20 November 2005,"Suburb graphics, weak on story","The animation in Robots far exceeds the previous high quality level generated by DreamWorks and the simple cartoon style of Pixar. The level of detail put into this project, everything from the individual characters, to the backgrounds and landscapes, and through the fast moving action sequences border on the realm of innovation. DreamWorks tends to make their edges a little too fuzzy, and the detail in the background mirrors that of a matte painting, Pixar seems to have simply taken traditional pen and ink animation and made it appear 3-D. 20th Century Fox, on the other hand, has developed a sharp contrast in the fine detail of the characters, the busy fullness of landscape shots, and the complex movements of an ocean of dominos. They even give liquids the look and feel they deserve.Unfortunately, with all the work Fox put into the animation, they didn't put the same level into the script. The traditional story line of a young man (or robot in this case) setting out on their own only to save the day through a series of lucky encounters, slapstick jokes, and sappy sympathy has been done so much that it has become trite. Aside from a few nods to well know films, there are no memorable moments where dialog and story structure are allowed to stand on its own. I'm sad to say that even with the voice talent in the picture, the animators fall back on slapstick rather than studding the actor's movement in order to inject some of that essence into the character. Don't get me wrong, the animators did a very good job with movement, but it was a little hard seeing a character sounding like Robin Williams, but moving round like Jerry Lewis.Hopefully Fox will keep their animation level consistent with their next endeavor, but persuade a few of the excellent writers from DreamWorks to give their story more bite."
232,Robots,,12 November 2005,Lackluster. Mostly animation for animation's sake.,"I am generally a fan of good animated movies. Some of my favorites include ""Disney's Tarzan"", ""Monster's Inc"", ""Finding Nemo"", and ""Shrek."" But those have good stories in addition to superb animation.""Robots"" does not have a very interesting story. It has been told often over the years in various movies. Youngster from a small town goes to the big city to make his or her mark, gets overwhelmed by the big city, manages to pull out of it, and ends up being a success. The hero here is Rodney, voiced by Ewan McGregor without a trace of Scottish accent. In fact all the voice actors are superb.This is a good movie for those who enjoy superb, non-stop animated action. It borrows its action cues from movies like Wizard of Oz, Indiana Jones, Mission Impossible Two, Star Wars, and similar action movies. Not that it copied them directly, but those are the movies I was reminded of while watching this one. After a while, I just became tired of the complicated action.The DVD has some interesting extras. My favorite is one that allows you to see the voice actor behind each main character, and their discussion of how they created the character."
233,Robots,6,24 October 2005,"Cute and does tricks, but not well built","This movie to me feels similar to how Bill Cosby once took apart chocolate cake mentally to make it a suitable breakfast. He said, ""Wheat. There is wheat in the chocolate cake. And eggs. Goody! And milk! Wheat, milk and eggs... that's nutrition!"" In ""Robots,"" it feels as though the producers had a similar dissection. ""Big stars for voices. And brightly colored computer animation. Hooray! Oo! Let's add in some fart jokes - those never get old!! Now let's whisk in a very sugary moral for kids to soak up. That's a movie!"" It also kind of reminds me of a sparkler in a way. Really bright and flashy and neat, but as it burns, you see it's just a stick and nothing more. ""Robots"" shows off and dazzles the viewer as long as it can, but if you look closer you see it has very little to offer at its core.The story is simple and wonderfully cliché, and the next hour or so is spent drilling the sappy moral into your head (You'd honestly have to be a zombie or something.), dazzling you with the most intricate and sophisticated animation Pixar has to offer, dozens of one-liners and random puns that have nothing to do with anything... the list goes on. ""Robots"" relies heavily on its all-star cast to keep the movie rolling, but overall, the main characters sounded very bored, and so the whole film begged one actor to save it. I've made movies and written scripts. You CANNOT assume that the movie will be saved if only one of your actors is funny and sounds genuinely interested in what he's doing (that means you, Mr. Williams). Much like in ""Aladdin,"" Robin Williams feels like he is the entire comedy club, despite being surrounded and supported by actors who are very talented and otherwise funny.Lack of interest aside, there's also a lack of chemistry between other characters. Much like in ""Skycaptain,"" Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow are very talented and work well together, but romantically are dead. Here, the gorgeous Halle Berry plays the ""romantic interest"" of Rodney, although she isn't assumed as his girlfriend until the end, where it sparks an awkward moment. Until this point she helps him, but it really would've been better if the producers hadn't tried to force a romantic interest into it at all. It has no place and doesn't work.Not to say this movie is BAD by any means. It will more than likely keep a child's interest for the whole running time, and may invoke some interesting discussions afterward. Adults will snicker at the multiple innuendos and sexual references (parents will get a kick out of making a baby in the beginning). Younger adults will likely feel nostalgic and want to play with things they haven't played with since the 80's and early 90's, like K'Nex and Domino competitions.Overall it was cute, and I'm glad I watched it once, but I think I could've found something better to spend my time on."
234,Robots,6,8 October 2005,"Creative, But A Few Screws Too Short","Lets start with the story, the typical story of the small town kid going to the big city. Makes friends with some interesting characters, but is tossed down by reality - almost returns home - but then turns around, saves the day - the end. I won't call that a spoiler, because lets face it - if they all turned into scrap, this wouldn't be a kids film. Even with such a typical story - it's easy to accept that and move on, but as the story unfolds, none of the climatic moments have real meaning. It fizzles and falls flat, and by the end I don't really care about any of these characters.Save for Wonder-bot, Rodney's first invention - who reminds me of Genie from 'Aladdin' more so than Robin Williams' own Fender. He is so full of personality and makes some great character development - and because he lacks a voice, you never feel like he's there because of some celebrity behind him. He reminds me a bit of Morph from 'Treasure Planet' - except cuter and more creative. Even Robin Williams isn't up to his potential, because we know what he can do with Genie, but perhaps the metal exterior isn't the best way to form him. He is a funny character, but also like the movie - most of these jokes can be found in the much funnier 'Futurama'. I personally prefer Bender, and would be interested in seeing how Rodney (such an innocent character he is) could deal with someone so opposite as him.All of the other characters are literally scrap - Amanda Bynes comes close to developing a character, but truly - there are too many characters going around that are very 2 dimensional. We don't get to know any of them, and I suspect that their only reason for existence is so they could harbor more celebrity voices. Take Halle Berry for example - she has NO REASON to be in this movie other than Ewan/Rodney's love interest. We all know she can act - but she certainly gave no character to this pointless girl. In fact I can't even remember her name. She just happens to show up and happens to have interest in Rodney - and just goes along. No chemistry at all - even at the end I'm still questioning her existence or even why she has a point in this film. I would have preferred for them to stick with Amanda Bynes being the love interest (as she has a crush on Rodney) - it's not like the age difference (which I couldn't figure out) would have mattered - especially since Robin Williams is her older brother. She at least had a more interesting character than Halle - and that's not really saying much.It's not a bad thing to have a lot of characters, look at Finding Nemo! But at least Finding Nemo gave each of their characters a bit of spotlight and allowed them to flex their personality. Everything was almost appealing - but never went much further than they really could have. I also thought the villain was pretty dull - he actually was quite a wimp when it came down to it. He's a momma's boy - and I couldn't possess any way of actually fearing this guy - because when it came down to it he was a shallow wimp. At least Disney bad guys will make us laugh - or if they don't they scare us up a bit - but this guy is just too typical a bad guy. There's nothing different about him - and he isn't memorable at all.Another problem I had was the soundtrack - too much of it! Randomly they would insert these pop songs, and it was even more pointless to the film. It's even obvious that they were in there just to be in there - and they would last for five seconds for that matter. Only the Britney Spears song actually had a point and that was just for a couple seconds for a joke. Any other pop/rap song thrown in just dated the film, and made an annoying distraction. The score was very nice - I don't see why anything else was really needed outside of using the music as a joke.This film is very beautiful, and very creative in appearance - but the story is just too flat to really achieve anything of classic status. I didn't smile at the end or have any feelings for wanting to see more. That's when you can tell a movie is good - when you wish it were longer, or that you really want to see more. The movie was very underwhelming, which is sad because at first it had so much wonderful potential. Their world is quite creative - and even some of the plot bits are clever. However in the end - it just isn't enough to satisfy, and leaves you rather empty. I was really hoping it would be memorable - but for it's few glittering moments, and it's fantastic art design - I give it a 6/10. I wish it was more than it was - because it really could have been great. For now - I'm just hoping they get back to Ice Age 2, and just pray that they don't screw it up.And lets face it ... Ewan McGregor is from Scotland and trying to pull off an American accent - and it doesn't really work. I just hope that most of these people go back to acting in front of the camera, because that's what they're good at. Voice acting is an art - and they're trying to make the Mona Lisa out of mud."
235,Robots,5,5 October 2005,Not Ice Age,"I know a little about 3D animation and really liked Ice Age. I cannot say the same for Robots. I was disappointed in the film as it was not as interesting as Ice Age. The technical aspects with the metal body animation was good but the character ""acting"" and dialogue did not live up to prior films. Kids would probably like the film strictly from a visual point of view. I judge the quality of a 3D animation movie just like a ""live"" movie. It takes a good story, good acting, and good direction among other things to make a good movie. Shrek, Ice Age, and Toy Story are good 3D animation films. I cannot rank Robots up to that level."
236,Robots,5,1 October 2005,over billed,"I thought this film was funny enough for my kids, but lacked that ""oomph"" that films like Monsters Inc had. It never really made sense, it was one where you had to suspend your disbelief throughout, as an adult, which makes it just a kid movie with a few adult-humor jokes the creators hope float over the kids' heads.One of the things that disturbed me about this movie was the billing. The number of stars listed on the box and in the credits suggests a series of cameos where you can enjoy your favorite star, or perhaps an ensemble cast. But really it is the Robin Williams show, and the creators don't use him as well as he's been in the past.For example: James Earl Jones' name is on the front of the box. There is one line where a robot inserts a voice box and says ""the Force is strong with this one"", and that's it. He gets front-of-the-box billing for a sound-clip that could've been nabbed from Star Wars. Another case in point is Halle Berry, who plays one of the major characters, but probably has 12 lines in the movie, a none-too-powerful force.Another disturbing trend continues, the characters that may not be appropriate for kids movies. Think of Tim...he is just MEAN, and doesn't really play a role of someone that Rodney overcomes with superior morales. He's just there to be mean, that's it.Still, the movie supports positive things for youngsters, most especially having a good self-image and believing in the power of your dreams. I give it a 5 of 10. I'll watch it again (heck, I bought it), but it won't make it on car-trips with my family."
237,Robots,6,21 September 2005,Cute and funny animation for families,"Recap: Rodney grows up in a little town on the countryside. His family doesn't have much money and can't buy much stuff, but some thing Rodney gets. A kind heart and the will to succeed. So one day he travels to the big Robot City, to become a real inventor and work for his hero Bigweld. The city are very foreign to him and when he arrives at Bigweld's factory, he learns that the kind welcoming air has been changed into a profit-minded harsh attitude. And Bigweld himself is mysteriously absent. Rodney find a few friends in some old obsolete robots, but when Ratchet, now the head of Bigweld's company decides to stop producing spare parts, many robots, including Rodney's family and friends are threatened to become obsolete, break and become scrap metal. There is only one way, Rodney and friends must find Bigweld.Comments: A cute, very beautifully and funny animated movie, mostly for younger kids. The basic story is clearly aimed at a younger audience, there fore I was surprised to come across a lot of jokes for an more adult audience. My guess is that most kids will find this funny and the company added some jokes, and a lot of references to other movies, to keep parents from getting too bored. And to be honest, a lot of the jokes are very funny, but sometimes they came a little too far apart for me. The story got a little dull in between. A lot of known actors loaned their voices to the robots and I think all were a nice fit with their characters. Best were, not surprisingly, Mel Brooks and Robin Williams. Especially Robin Williams are very good at using his voice in a manner suitable to the character he loans it to. Well, all in all, this is not the kind of movie I would see with my friends, being a lot older than the intended audience. This is a movie for families when parents and their young children want to watch something together, and most likely everybody will enjoy it.6/10"
238,Robots,6,6 September 2005,Animators have (literally) lost the plot,"I wrote a scathing review of Shark's Tale a while back, and since I've not heard great things about Madagascar either I can only conclude that this movie confirms my suspicions: Dreamworks and Fox don't know what they're doing in the story or character departments.I can not deny the technical achievements for the animation - I'm sure the studio was wetting itself with excitement at some of the fluid and particle dynamics we witness in this one - but a movie should have an original story... and this one just doesn't! It's a brain-deadening revisit to the preaching, simplistic, moralistic ""inspirational"" tales I hated even when I was a kid myself. It uses every cliché in the book: hard-up young kid has a dream, goes to the big city, gets knocked down by evil rich guy, loses hope, friends inspire hope, guy rouses crowd, evil guy exposed, etc. etc. etc.No spoiler warning here, since there is nothing to spoil - you have seen variations on this cheesy theme a hundred thousand times already. As with Shark's Tale and Shrek 2 there is nothing original in here to keep me the slightest bit interested! Added to the unoriginality are the jarring and un-funny ""funny"" bits, which mostly consist of things getting damaged in ballistic manner... complete with rapid shouting, explosive sound effects and ""funny"" music. Don't get me wrong, I managed to smile once or twice, but most of the time I was just feeling numb to it.Cases in point: what is funny about a fight being interrupted by a two-second Britney Spears impersonation?!? If there a *reason* for it to happen (or it happens when it *shouldn't*) then it could be amusing, but this just made me think ""why? so what?"". Another one is a robot saying ""the Force is strong in this one"" for no apparent reason... they build it up in its own short scene, and my reaction is... ""was that it?"".Randomly throwing in pop-culture references doesn't make any sense when they have nothing to do with anything! An unexpected in-character or out-of-character phrase or action can be funny. Sudden changes in events or plot revelation can be funny. On the other hand, someone turning on a light-switch and saying ""make it so"" is not. If it's important that the light is switched on, there's been a nice build-up in the dramatic tension, and ""make it so"" is unexpected given the situation or the character saying it (or is some clever reference to Star Trek that fits the moment)... then that's a different matter.I may have made that one up, but it's at the level I'm talking about here.So, add to that the rather unattractive robot designs, generally uninteresting characters and dialogue drowned out by music and sound effects - it's pretty poor. Saved only by the good animation."
239,Robots,5,22 August 2005,Poor animation and simply not very funny or enjoyable,"I'm already tired of DreamWorks' animation studios. They've stolen the ideas of Pixar and created ugly, annoying films like ""Shark Tale"" and ""Madagascar."" Oh, and ""Robots."" This one is just as bad as DreamWorks' other animated films Whereas Pixar gave 3D animated films a good name back in '95 with ""Toy Story,"" DreamWorks stole the magic a few years later with ""Antz"" (which was pretty funny) and then ""Shrek"" (which I didn't care for as much as other people). At first it was kind of cute and ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"" were good enough (I particularly liked ""Shrek 2"") but after that the line kind of blurred.The animation in ""Madagascar"" was simply lazy and ""Robots"" is not very different. There are a few moments of incredible landscape, but the features of the characters themselves are hideous and appalling.The voice talents are impressive - Mel Brooks, Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Robin Williams - but Williams and Brooks are the only ones who really stand out, and even then, Williams isn't so funny anymore. (He needs to get back into adult comedy.) The ""in-jokes"" are only so-so. There are a few chuckle-worthy gags, but nothing that made me laugh out loud.I think DreamWorks should leave the animated family films to Pixar and go back to hogging all the Oscar nominations."
240,Robots,5,12 June 2005,no surprises,"I was hoping I'd see something which would stand up to masterpieces such as ""Finding Nemo"" for example, but this one is no surprise. Computer graphics are nice (they do fit well to today standards, but don't go any higher than that). Story is very simple and totally predictable. You've seen it so many times. There's a balance kept between serious, emotional approach and funny stuff. Unfortunately it doesn't matter much, because both these elements are screwed. Characters are flat, not much of an interesting ones, so authors can't let you get deep into them; their feelings, their acts, because they're more like elements of computer graphics than real robots with feelings (however funny it might sound). The ""jokes"" part is also screwed. The red robot is just a pure imitation of the one from ""Treasure Planet"". ""Robots"" is filled with humorous approach, but it also doesn't matter much, because it mostly is not funny. The mass-jokes are simple and prove lack of humor and imagination lying in the script. This might be a good movie to watch with your children, but again don't expect it to make you laugh much or be touched by the deep story, because you probably won't. It's just another movie, that's all."
241,Robots,6,10 June 2005,"Good for Kids, Boring for Adults","Pixar this is not. I love all the Pixar movies. They are entertaining for kids and adults as well. My husband and I kept looking at our watches during this one and fidgeting in our seats. Just like kids would do at a serious movie. It started out cute, but began to drag about halfway through. However, at the end of the movie, my 5 year old son said he couldn't wait to see it again. My 2 1/2 year old daughter was somewhat entertained, but she has a pretty short attention span. They have some of the toys from the fast food kid meals, and seem pretty excited about them - my 2 1/2 year old even knows the names of the characters before she's told! My suggestion is to rent this when it comes out on DVD and let your kids watch it by themselves. Don't subject yourself to this!"
242,Robots,5,19 May 2005,"Entertaining, if forgettable, animated film","""Robots"" is not a bad movie. However, it is very average, for an animated film. Although it may keep you entertained for an afternoon, it won't hold up for a while. The best thing about the movie is the computer technology. It looks gorgeous and is sure to delight almost anyone. The characters aren't bad. Rodney Copperbottom is your average boring main hero. Halle Berry is the love interest. Robin Williams is the comic relief (although he gets annoying at times). The story is okay, but doesn't raise it above other movies.One of the biggest problems is the robot world they live in. A lot of it seems rather pointless. What's the purpose of the complicated transportation system? Sure, it's fun to see the pinball game style, but such a complicated system seems overly complicated both in the real world, and the computer generated one. Although ""Monsters Inc."" had a similar roller coaster ride type feel, there was a purpose to it. Furthermore, what's with the fart jokes? Aside from the fact that these are woefully overused in recent years, they make no sense for beings without a biological digestive system. Also, what's with the simple title. Could they have come up with something a little more descriptive? It's not like ""Finding Nemo"" is called ""Fish."" Overall, it's not a bad movie. Still, it's nothing special."
243,Robots,6,19 May 2005,A Game of Guess Who,"Robots follows a typical storyline: Boy moves into big city to redeem himself to earn his parents' love. Not the most fanciful or original plot line, but then again this film wasn't made to be original but entertaining.The movie manages to elicit a constant stream of laughs whether they are visual gags or references to pop culture, e.g. Ms. Britney Spears.The most fun part of the movie is recognizing the parade of famous voices that inhabit these animated characters. What fun it would have been to be a fly on the sound room wall, listening to Ewan and Robin and Mel and Drew. That's pretty much where the movie starts and ends: all about the famous voices.The art direction is fairly standard with a few visual gags on the robots buy beyond the fun it's nothing worth watching again.Entertaining for youths and adults alike, but I don't imagine anyone finding repeat watchings like Toy Story or the Incredibles or Monsters, Inc."
244,Robots,6,24 April 2005,Not bad.,"This movie is a hard one to review. Its a massive improvement on the lame incredibles which I hate with a passion. If pixar had of kept developing in that direction, they could actually become quite bad.Now into the review. The film's animation is pretty good, pixar are always good in that department. It's a good movie for kids, it tells broadcasts positive and good messages to kids like ""never give up"" and ""you can shine no matter what your made of"". Unlike the incredibles, this film was a lot better. I heard adults laughing and kids laughing. I didn't laugh, but I don't laugh very often, but my girlfriend thought it was hilarious but she laughs at everything so I guess that balances things out. There are countless puns in this movie, and they are all great. The end is a massive battle which is a rip off from LOTR, its also very one sided, which kind of ruined it.To sum up, this is worth a watch. If your an adult, this wont be one of the films where you will feel your being tortured cause the adults in the cinema seemed to think it was funny. A film good for a rainy day, and an excellent film for the young ins."
245,Robots,7,21 April 2005,"A few blatant flaws, but overlook them and this is great stuff","Eeeeeeeeeeeeh........I don't know what to think of this film.I like it. That's a plus. I like it a lot, and I'll certainly watch it again. But it has three main problems: it relies on formulae for laughs too much, it smacks of laziness in parts, and it's pretty confused.It's a funny film, no doubt, and I'll watch it again and laugh. But just because I laugh at a joke doesn't mean I haven't seen before. Many of the jokes are visual gags based on puns about robots and taking phrases out of context, which, while funny, begin to tire. And one joke's incredibly puerile (the farting one) - but by dragging that joke out and giving you something unexpected with it (I won't say what), it goes from ""I wish this wasn't in the film"" to ""Man, that's funny stuff"". However, while the fact remains that while funny, many show little imagination, there are a lot of gags which are funny and original, too. And Robin Williams' improv is, as ever, damn hilarious ""Stick with me kid, I know this town like the back of my hand- hey, that's new."" As for laziness - I realise that making a film, game, etc., etc., is a hard job. I'm not saying the crew for this film are bad. Far from it. Hell, just look at the film. The art on those robots (all that rust and those realistic scratches and stuff) is fantastic. In other departments, though, things seems to be lacking. Take the animation, for example - it's good, while not astonishing, but the lip-syncing stands out as being crap. In something like Toy Story it's easy to suspend your critical faculties and just get involved in the film, while with Robots it's not so easy, and I think a large part of this relies in the syncing. Most speech is accompanied by pretty vague mouth movements, which is simply lazy. Nothing but. A slight factor towards this could be that obviously the animators were doing robots' mouths rather than creatures or humans', but come on, they pulled a fair few strings with the main character - his mouth willingly deforms and it's made of metal (not a criticism, I'm just saying this shouldn't be a disadvantage if they're willing to go to that level of suspension of disbelief).And, well, I was scratching my head by the end. This again fits into laziness. Ultimately, the message the film has at the end is confusing, and gives a strong impression that the writers hadn't thought it through at all. To ruin it for you (hey, I said there were spoilers), the film follows one robot (Rodney Copperbottom) who goes to the big city to follow his dream and meet this big 'Best Robot In The World' guy. BRITH owned a big company whose overall message to all robots everywhere was essentially to be who they are, because that's what life's all about, or some crap. However, he's been ousted (apparently, it wasn't really explained, which leads to further confusion) by this evil money-grabbing scheme-bot who turns the company on its head, so now it propagates ideas of ""If you're rubbish, don't get fixed and maintain your sense of self, just get an upgrade!"" - Everybody, of course, hates this. Various things happen, RC meets BRITH and BRITH has a change of heart from having given up on life for no tangible reason and goes back to fighting for the cause, big revolution, blah blah blah, but then...OH NO! What's going on? In preparation for the big battle with the corporation that's coming at the end, everyone builds upgrades onto themselves! And when they inevitably win, BRITH now goes around saying upgrades own and stuff! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!? All in all, there's a big case of mixed messages at the end. Are we supposed to go away from the film thinking that although we should be ourselves, we should also do our best to change ourselves? - LAZY. Lazy scripting.And the other confusing thing - why is it robots? Why not humans? What impact does it have on the story (by which I mean STORY and not FILM) to have robots? With Toy Story, if they weren't toys the story wouldn't have made sense. With Monsters Inc., if they weren't monsters the story wouldn't have made sense. With Robots, if they weren't robots the story would still make sense. The only reasons they're robots are that it panders to children and gives the writers opportunity for robot puns.Ignoring the glaring problems with the film, it's damn good. I guess that's it. Sounds stupid to say after all that criticism, but hey, that's life. Get a helmet."
246,Robots,,16 April 2005,Nuts and Bolts of Lightning.,"The makers of ""Ice Age"" come back strong with this wild, entertaining and fun glimpse into the lives of their title characters. One small town robot (voiced by Ewan McGregor) tries to make it as an inventor in the big city so he can help his quickly aging father survive, but problems arise in every direction with hilarious results. Evil cyborgs are using corporate strong-arm techniques to eliminate old robots that are obsolete so they can make loads of money selling newer, sleeker equipment. Highly creative animated feature that uses old story-telling principles to get new-age computer-graphic innovations across to the audience. Voice characterizations are right on target with Robin Williams' (arguably the best actor for animated voices) robot stealing the show. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
247,Robots,6,11 April 2005,"Busted, obsolete...","Robots is a familiar story (young outcast struggling against the odds to prove self-worth and help like-minded outcasts), with two variations: cutting-edge animation and Robin Williams. So it's sort of a high-tech FernGully, or a poor man's Aladdin.Rodney Copperbotton (Ewan McGregor) is a enterprising young robot who heads to Robot City to seek his fortune - namely, to meet Mr. Bigweld (Mel Brooks), who runs an entrepreneurial robot think-tank where inventors can pitch and eventually follow through on their ideas and visions. But Rodney quickly learns the bad side of good business when he's abruptly shown the door by the company's interim head, Ratchet (Greg Kinnear). Rodney learns that Ratchet plans to make all of the robots in Robot City choose either to buy expensive new upgrades or become.... outmoded. As in turned into scrap metal and then melted down. Which kind of begs the whole issue of reincarnation, since these are walking and talking robots. But since this is for a kiddie audience, the movie skirts that all-important issue.Will Rodney find redemption? Oh, it's possible. This is from the same fine folks who brought you Ice Age. Think of it as more like Toy Story, with the motley band of lovable personalities banding together to survive and beat the bad guys. But there's a crucial difference between the films: Toys are cute and cuddly, and robots are not. No knock against the animation process used in Robots, but I've had Legos that had more character than some of these bots.A notable exception is Williams, doing what Robin Williams does best. Even if everything he said wasn't ad libbed, he makes you feel as if it is - and that's part of his charm. His extroversion wins you over in the part of Fender (""I used to be bumper, then we moved to the city""), the robot who's slowly falling apart and is set to be outmoded.When movies such as Toy Story and A Bug's Life came out, we were wowed by the technologically wonderful animation. But audiences are notoriously fickle; we're now used to computer animation being this good, and so we're not as easily distracted by the effects. The ""sets"" on Robots - especially the elaborate transportation found in Robot City - are fantastic, but it seems they would have been even more impressive if they'd been in a short cartoon. The domino sequence was particularly marvelous to behold.As with most kidlet-appeal movies, Robots tugs hard on your fragile heartstrings. I mean, you know darn well how it's going to end, and you still can't help but feel good when it's over. So the film is successful in that regard. The kids in the theater in which I saw the movie seemed to like it well enough, based on their laughter, but I didn't get a sense that they thought it was as awesome as, say, Toy Story, which probably spoiled everyone for a long while.Robots isn't terribly charming or creative in its storyline or characterizations, although the animation is top notch."
248,Robots,7,8 April 2005,It made me laugh,"In spite of the hype, I wasn't wholly sure I wanted to see 'Robots'. But two kids of 9 and 7 knew they did, so off we toddled to the local. And I was more than impressed. Some stunning animation scenes, references to other Sci-Fi films abound (the amazing scene when Copperbottom arrives at Robot City is stunning) and some genuinely funny, laugh out loud gags keep you highly entertained. It may not be the most original of stories (taking Azimov's - and the recent movie -'I Robots' one stage further where robots want to take over the robot world), and, with most animation, there is that occasional 'two dimensional feel' to the characters, but overall I thoroughly, and unexpectedly, enjoyed this - and I still laugh at the scene with the Waltons reference and certain bodily functions.."
249,Robots,,8 April 2005,Urgent!   Read this review and talk about the movie theme with your kids.,"The story is hackneyed but the theme is fresh and important! The issue raised is corporate needs-creating vs. consumer needs-supplying. In the end the advocate of consumer needs prevails. The creed of the film's protagonist is ""find a need and fill it"". The antagonist is vertically integrated monopoly seeking to illegally control the market, whereby its most profitable product is the only one for purchase and the waste created by obsolescence is a secondary profit source. I think it's great a child's film would address this very significant issue, and expose children to the fact that their ""needs"" the media refer to, are probably at odds with their true organic needs. The film flirts with the more interesting suggestion/theme that consumers should control the means of production as that is the only manner in which the evils created by the concentration of capital/power can be held in check. Questions to ask your child after the movie: why was the antagonist bad, what did he do wrong? Which is better new or used?"
250,Robots,6,6 April 2005,Scrap-metal heroes just scrape above average!,"'Robots' never really becomes a classic as other computer-animated films of late such as 'Shrek', 'Finding Nemo' and 'Toy Story'! It is nicely animated in parts but still retains a cartoon feel, but the filmmakers didn't do much with the story, and overall the film is extremely tongue'n'cheek in parts- with a few nice alternative gags to human existence if people were robots (i.e. a robot buffering his lawn, and the making a baby gag). However, we are never really drawn into an alternative world ala 'Ice Age' when rap music and Britney Spears intrude, and don't get me started on the ending! Some jokes were clever with displaying how the robots would live, but it was a little tiresome eventually- especially with the fart jokes and some robot's rear end. Also, although Robin Williams does a good job as an annoying character called Fender, he never really captures the same voice majesty as he previous did in 'Aladdin'- which is by far his funnier voice performance! The film has a decent voice cast with Ewan McGregor as our hero in Rodney Copperbottom, as well as; Halle Berry, Paul Giamatti (who really does well in my opinion), Mel Brooks, Greg Kinnear (as the villain) and Jim Broadbent (as the other villain)! But this cast can't do anything with such a meager story! This could have been still kid's film with a more intriguing plot, although I did like the anti-corporate sentiment the film had- with the forced upgrades reflecting the sleek new modern technology. And God knows why Mr Gasket, the villain, had a robot tie in the film! I'm pretty to animation, and kid's movies, and although 'Robots' was entertaining enough, it just doesn't reach the level of previous animated films of its ilk! Just above average in my mind! *** out of *****!"
251,Robots,,2 April 2005,Great family fun,"Robots is a another film in the long line of computer animation based features to grace our screens in recent years. It involves the adventures of Rodney Copperbottom and his travails in Robot City to prove that everyone is worthwhile- no matter what their background. So while the movie hardly breaks new ground plot wise it is actually a very good thing. Despite the rantings of many people that Robots is a flawed film due to its simple plot line, this is just the standard level of elitism to be found by people who suffer a superiority complex. Take your children, or younger siblings, or young relatives to this movie. Enjoy the jokes, marvel at the level of detail in the art and don't expect ""Citizen Kane"" and you will have a good time. That's all that a movie like this should be- an enjoyable entertainment that keeps a simple plot line and nice moral message. Anyone expecting more from this film is having a serious pull and should be ignored as a menace to good honest fun as well as society in general.4 out of 5 stars"
252,Robots,,2 April 2005,As good as any Pixar animated film,"Robots (2005) Voices of Ewan McGregor, Robin Williams, Greg Kinnear, Mel Brooks, Halle Berry, Drew Carrey, Amanda Bynes, Stanley Tucci, Paul Giamatti, Jim Broadbent, D: Chris Wedge, Carlos Saldanha. In a robot-populated world, an ambitious small-town inventor journeys to Robot City to sell his new gizmo to a tycoon, and along the way meets many wacky characters, but finds himself in an evil plot to deny robots their needed spare parts. Every bit as clever and visually delightful as anything produced by Pixar Animation, with cute, colorful characters and funny one-liners, but the storyline is collected from spare parts and pop culture references are getting old. The vocal performances by everyone are still entertaining, and as one of the characters, the hyperactive Fender, Williams fortunately gets most of the funny lines. 91 min., rated PG. ***"
253,Robots,6,1 April 2005,"A good movie, thanks to Williams","Ewan McGregor is the voice of Rodney, a robot who wants to make the world a better place. Rodney travels to Robot City to take his invention to the greatest robot inventor ever, Mr Bigweld (Mel Brooks) but he finds that Mr Bigweld has been replaced by a greedy corporate robot with evil plans. Rodney meets Fender (Robin Williams) and they team up with a group of unlikely heroes to rescue Mr Bigweld.If it wasn't for Robin Williams and his character, the movie would have been quite ordinary. Williams character steals the show with plenty of typical Williams comedy gems and energy (keep an eye out for the Britney Spears scene in the big battle - you won't see it coming!) The plot was fine as a children's movie but it was often a little slow and perhaps over the heads of some of the younger viewers.6/10"
254,Robots,5,26 March 2005,Eye candy but no plot - A movie that's less than the sum of its parts,"Basically this is the story of a young robot who goes to the big city to make his fortune, but I can't say much more than that since this film is severely lacking a anything resembling a solid narrative.Its not a bad movie, but it should have been so much better since the pieces wildly outshine the whole. Everything about this film, if taken as pieces is first rate, but when you put them together you're left with a mess. The best way I can think of describing it take the best stuff from twenty or thirty great films and then mix them together so as to tell a new story. The bits will be great but I doubt the new story will be.When the movie comes out on home video then see it, but rushing to see it in a theater will be a waste...especially since most sequences are so jam packed with visual delights you'll want to hit rewind and freeze frame to make sure you're catching it all. (frankly if visuals were enough to win Oscars this film would be the best picture shoe in.) 5 out of 10. A disappointment as a whole."
255,Robots,,25 March 2005,"A review for the ones that loved ""Ice Age""","I would like to start with one sentence ""Perfect"" .. the movie is amazing for ANY one that liked ice age. i have yet to See it in the English version, but the Norwegian version impressed me, and since there are no changes in the story, i suspect it only to be better.""Robots follows an Young robot called Rodney on his journey to the big town , there he wants to meet the best robot ever. Cause he want to be an inventor"" Does this sound like an clisjè ? (spelled wrong i know) Well it is NOT. This movie is really funny. they have added an incredible cast in the English version for the voices, and thats perfect. Because its so much impressive characters to match them , that's what makes this movies good... but whats makes is perfect. well for me is all those funny moments, the way the keep it up all the time. I wont spoil any thing here, but i will say .. there are so much ... so... INCREDIBLE much they have put in this movie.. they even put in ""Britney Spears, Darth Vader ... and last .. a War..."" and as they add humor around every corner.. u will never stop laughing.

256,Robots,,25 March 2005,Literally Blue Sky,"This wonderful movie tells the age-old story of a young man (one day - very soon - this will be possible for girls as well, I trust) leaving his family in the small town and going to the big city (of course New York or its parallel-universe equivalent) to pursue his dreams. In his attempts he is also provided with the chance to free the oppressed ""working"" class which provides a bunch of colorful and lovable characters. The initially weak ones have a chance to show courage and characters apparently powerful reveal their weaknesses. This has been the theme of countless popular theater pieces and movies in the past and this formula will certainly never age. The name of the animation studio: ""Blue Sky"" certainly also reflects the way the look at the world and I am delighted to see that they complete the studios competing in the GC animated field to the number of three after Pixar and Dreamworks. Robots certainly is comparable to the best Pixar and Dramworks have produced so far. The incredibly stunning visuals are a happier ""daylight"" and much less gloomy version of what Tim Burton films, ""Dark City"" and ""Lemony Snicket's a series of..."" are envisioning. These are parallel dimensions made of our dreams and memories. The forms and designs in Robots range from Victorian mid 19th century clockwork mechanics over 30s art deco, 50s sci-fi (the era our hero Rodney Copperbotom seems to come from) until the highly modern ""new edge"" design which seems to provide the design concept for the villains.John Powell's original orchestral score is wonderful, impeccably performed and recorded, and sets the mood right from the start. The choice of songs ""sprinkled"" throughout the movie is very good.The ""working class"" heroes provide a colorful (in fact each one - in a small group - has his or her own unique color) background and great opportunities for a comedy style that reminds us of the ""Marx Brothers"". Robin Williams' incredible voice talent almost outshines all others. Mel Brooks seasoned and powerful baritone comes a close second. Paul Giamatti is wonderfully annoying as Tim the mischievous gate guard. By the very nature of their roles Ewan Mc Gregor (Rodney) and Halle Berry (Cappy - the corporate secretary coming over to the good side falling an love for Rodney) can't show the full range of their voice talents - hence I see no point for criticism here. The makers obviously had a lot of fun creating a world that totally defies logic - including all the robot characters that perform tasks and movements defying all laws of physics except the ones firmly established in ""cartoonland"". There are Rube Goldberg style inventions - providing the mechanics for roller coaster style rides - made of copper tubing, spring loaded see-saws etc. complete with the reference of the egg-laying chicken provided by Fender (Williams). Flintstone/Jetsons style analogies of every day life tasks are everywhere. This movie is a dream for design artists. There is a lightheartedness and good spirited nature to it without sacrificing some ""edge"" coming from the typical pop references, the very funny zany slapstick humor and the all too true social comments - all delivered with zest.This is certainly a movie aimed at smaller children and their parents. No obvious attempt has been made to capture the (coveted) teenage audiences which may find the ""family values"" and overall ""positive simplicity"" to uncool. I can only applaud Blue Sky studios to make a movie about good old fashioned values that will never out date, going to great lengths updating them for today's demanding audiences."
257,Robots,,24 March 2005,"Good to look at, but story is a dud","Robots is pretty interesting eye candy, with some impressive action scenes(I really enjoyed the early transit scene involving Rodney and Fender), but the story just doesn't take you in, and the laughs are limited to a few coughed up chuckles here and there. There are numerous pop culture references throughout, but it feels tired and rehashed after having witnessed the two Shrek films. Someone forgot to reel Robin Williams in, as he goes WAY overboard with his overcaffinated shtick. Williams in this gear is best served in smaller doses (ala Alladin), but he is practically in every scene, going full throttle. The rest of the character voices used in the film (with the possible exception of Mel Brooks) could have been spoken by anyone, and looking at the all-star line-up, I can't help but wonder if all that money used to sign these guys couldn't have been more wisely spent on a better writing team."
258,Robots,,22 March 2005,"Aye, Robots!","ROBOTS (2005) **1/2 (VOICES: Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Robin Williams, Greg Kinnear, Mel Brooks, Drew Carey, Amanda Bynes, Harland Williams, Jennifer Coolidge, Jim Broadbent, Paul Giamatti, Stanley Tucci, James Earl Jones, Jay Leno, Al Roker, Dianne Wiest, Dan Hedaya, Natasha Lyonne, Alan Rosenberg, Stephen Tobolowsky) Hit-and-miss animated comedy set in a world of robots with an enterprising young male (a surprisingly bland McGregor) who embarks on a journey to make a name for himself in the ever changing mechanics of life for an automaton and meeting several new friends in the process. Eye-candy wonderful for its amazingly colorful production design by William Joyce the film is disappointingly non-connective with the audience due to its lackluster script by the usually on-target comedy team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel and story credits to Jim McClain and Ron Mita. While directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha attempt to keep things busy with its many diverting moments  particularly the Rube Goldberg inspired transit moment that is quite affective  on the whole it is not an instant classic despite a plethora of creative talent including Williams' antics as a borderline annoying sidekick."
259,Robots,7,21 March 2005,Enjoyable and not too clichéd,"Mel Brooks delivers wonderful voice dialog for Bigweld, the warm and caring kind of entrepreneur we wish the world was full of, while Robin Williams Fender has enough screws loose to keep the film breezing along. Beautiful rendering, with a touch of corrosion here and there, give a look and feel of tin toys from decades ago, by contrast lending menace to the polish of stainless, titanium and pinstriping of a corporate world, which oddly includes Bigweld. Rodney is an everyman's hero, who stands up for what he believes in, with friends to pull him through his moment of despair. Plenty of eye-candy show what can be done as CGI matures and should make this an IMAX must-see for the scale of Robot City and its enigmatic and energetic public transportation system. This should be a real hit with the younger kids, as many around me oohed-and-ahhed and applauded at the ending. It's good to see entertainment which sinks no lower than fart-jokes. Is a sequel too much to hope for?"
260,Robots,6,20 March 2005,Eh....,"As far as children's movies go, Robots was more than decent. As far as Pixar movies go, however, it seems more like the company tried to ride the coat-tails of Incredibles. The movie was decent, as far as everything was concerned, but for anyone who was looking for another movie for the kids with lots of parent-oriented adult humor as well, the movie is sorely lacking in this area. Robin William's manic antics were often amusing, but it is clear that once again he was told to just scat, and the story was tweaked to fit in the most appropriate comedy he unleashed.Character development is, for the most part, non-existent in the film. Rodney has about as much inner conflict as my cat, and what little changes in Mel Brooks' and Drew Carey's characters seems pretty contrived until until the musical cues kick in and it becomes clear that the scenes are definitely so. No other characters really develop at all. Very little humor isn't childish, the plot fits together so seamlessly even children might wonder why, and the combination of lines and music made the girl sitting next to me threaten random bodily harm should it ""get any more sentimental"".All-in-all, by far not Pixar's best work, but certainly worth the free movie ticket that was sitting in my pocket."
261,Robots,,20 March 2005,Different voice version?,I was wondering if anyone knew if different people were used to voice some characters in different countries. I live in the U.K. and the version I saw included Cat Deeley as Loretta and also included Terry Wogan. When looking online I found that Loretta was is named as being voiced by Natasha Lyonne and Cat Deeley and Terry Wogan aren't mentioned. Does anyone know about this? Does this happen often with animations?I loved the film and found it hilarious but am a bit miffed by the different voices. I mean i was proud that so many British people were used to voice the different characters. Ewan McGregor starring in two animations this year is great. I love to see British talent finding roles in U.S. movies. It's also good that nowadays animations are attracting as many adults as they are children. This one especially had many different levels of jokes and Robin Williams as usually was brilliant. I did find though through a lot of it I was trying to recognise voices. Definitely funny and good Quality. I work at a cinema and it's attracted a lot of people. All who seem to come out quite happy.
262,Robots,6,17 March 2005,Standard plot good for kids,"This is a fun movie that is a good way to pass time that will certainly appeal to a family audience and do very good on the box office.It is by no means great: it is not as good as Ice Age or Saving Nemo, but way better than lame cartoons like Shark Tales. I give it a 6/10, but a kid or a parent will most likely give it a 7 or 8/10.This is a growing up plot, where a teen leaves his small town with ideals, to get hired as an inventor in the most famous firm. Unfortunately his hero CEO has been overthrown by an evil CEO who's into profits and shareholder value and does not care about inventions, good value and the welfare of the customers.I would rate this a G cartoon, with good family values that will appeal to parents conscious of what their children are exposed to. I remember The Grinch which was terrible and also shocked me as having inappropriate humor and content for the targeted young kids audience.The movie is well made, though not too original. Humor is cute but I preferred the humor in Ice Age. Animation in fast scenes are too fast for an adult brain, typical of some cartoons.HP employees will enjoy this as there's an obvious parallel with the Carly Fiorina era vs the Bill and Dave old style company management based on humane values."
263,Robots,,13 March 2005,Not see the movie yet...,"... as it is not out in the UK yet, but it seems to bear a remarkable similarity to a children's animated TV show 'Little robots' (that my son, aged 3, loves). Have a look at the following site, and see what you think (http://www.littlerobots.com/ourworld/index.htm). Is this deliberate or merely intellectual property-rights theft? Is the TV show airing in the USA? If not, for the uninitiated, it is about a Little Robot called Tiny, and his friends Sporty, Noisy, Scary, Spotty and some others (or is this a Spice Girls reunion - can't be - they were all spotty, weren't they?) Ho hum - I'll probably get it in DVD when it comes out over here, but if anyone has seen both 'Robots' it would be nice to know."
264,Robots,5,13 March 2005,maybe the IMAX version will be better,"The animated feature Robots is very much what you expect from the makers of Ice Age - mildly entertaining in spots. The dance on ball bearings was my favorite bit. Robin Williams delivers so many one-liners that a few of them are bound to be funny. Like so many postmodern cartoons, Robots mocks sentimentality at the same time that it relies on sentimentality to keep the viewer interested. The funniest bit is the cartoon before the movie, featuring Scrat. It is very short and ends ""To Be Continued"". I assumed we would see more of Scrat after the credits, but there are no credit cookies. I guess we will have to wait for the next animated feature from Blue Sky to see more of their most successful character - or maybe the DVD will have a new Scrat cartoon, like the DVD of Ice Age did.The plot is the standard rich-guy-tires-to-screw-working-class-hero plot that seems to power half the films that come out of Hollywood. It has become such a standard that by now it amounts to boilerplate on which to hang character and incident and gags. Even rich people let their kids watch cartoons like this, which is a bit like NRA members allowing their kids to watch Bambi. Rick Norwood, sfsite"
265,Robots,,12 March 2005,Robots was dull and missed a chance to teach about capitalism.,"Last night I went to see Robots, Fox's most recent animated adventure, and it was pretty dull. The animation and voice acting were great, but the plot was thin and the script was barely amusing; the only parts I actually laughed at were incidental background widgets thrown in by the artists (such as male and female robot bathrooms labeled with images of plugs and sockets). Aside from all that, the movie was incredibly frustrating because the writers chickened out on a golden opportunity to educate young viewers on the merits of capitalism.To explain briefly, Robots takes place in a metal world inhabited entirely by robots. Apparently, the robots are all built by a company owned by a big round robot named Big Weld. Big Weld's company is taken over (somehow) by an executive named Ratchet, and Big Weld loses hope and retires into obscurity to play with dominoes. Ratchet is more obsessed with making money than with helping other robots, so he decides that the company is going to stop making spare parts and only sell ""upgrades"" from now on -- upgrades that are too expensive for the poorer robots to afford, which results in them being melted down once they can't be repaired.These events set the stage for Rodney, the hero, to solve the problem. He's an inventor himself and gains some quick popularity by fixing some poor robots who can't get spare parts. Rather than charging money for this service -- as is sarcastically suggested by another robot -- he does it for free and then laments that the robots can't be fully repaired without parts. A clever writer would have realized that by charging money, Rodney and his friends could have set up their own company in competition with Ratchet and easily cornered a significant market niche that the villain intentionally neglected.Children could have learned that only a foolish capitalist would stop making spare parts and thus eliminate a huge revenue stream and a whole host of customers. That's no way to make a profit! The motto of Big Weld was ""see a need, fill a need"", and the mantra was repeated many times throughout the movie. Indeed, that motto is fundamental to capitalism, and the film would have provided a great foundation for introducing the concepts to children. Obviously Big Weld understood how to make money, or he never would have accumulated the capital necessary to dominate the robot manufacturing market, so why did he allow Rodney and the audience to wallow in naivety? In the end, Rodney rouses Big Weld from his self-imposed exile and helps him reclaim the company, thus re-establishing the monopoly structure that led to the problems in the first place. Why not instead teach kids to start their own company rather than depend on the moods of others? Why not teach kids the value of competition? Why not teach kids that the best way to make money is to provide something people want?"
