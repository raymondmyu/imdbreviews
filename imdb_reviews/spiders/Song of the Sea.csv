0,Song of the Sea,10,6 March 2015,One of the best animated features of all time,"I guess the title kind of gives it away, doesn't it? Still, I'm not one who's given to hyperbole when describing movies, and I'm enough of a critic that I want to nitpick to insane degrees from time to time, but I just can't do it with Song of the Sea. There's just nothing to point out.This movie is from the same studio that brought us The Secret of Kells (2009), an almost beguilingly charming movie that brought together elements of Druidic myth, passionate Christian faith, history, and Celtic grandeur in a way that I don't think anyone had ever really seen before. When a studio with such a good first effort under their belt takes five years to come out with a second film, you can bet that it's because they're doing something magical.The only real comparison that's able to be drawn is to the work of Hayao Miyazaki, simply because there's not another animated filmmaker out there who's as honest and earnest with their culture's folklore to compare to. Where Miyazaki-san's work is steeped in spiritual fantasy and a love for his home country not really seen since the Romantic movement, Tomm Moore is a bit more grounded in Western storytelling and keeps his myths well interacted with daily life. His stories are a whimsical blend of magic and the mundane, and it's all carried so well that you wish it could all be true.The story of Saoirse and her brother Ben is cut from the classic Hero's Journey so closely that you can practically see Joseph Campbell's fingerprints on the screen. In the back of my mind, I was pointing out each and every plot point as it went by, like an eager sightseer out the side of a tour bus. While the story is formulaic, sure, it's executed brilliantly and engagingly. As we so often forget; Tropes Are Not Bad. It's fantastic to see the tools of storytelling so perfectly implemented. It's like watching a master painter or musician craft their art.Speaking of which, Song of the Sea doesn't lack for anything in the artistic departments. The visuals are jaw-droppingly beautiful, simplistic in design, true to the Celtic roots of the story, and should almost be listed as a character in and of themselves. This story simply couldn't have been told as well with a different art crew, the dynamic is so tied into the feel and flow of the tale. The score is, similarly, simplistic and heartfelt. It doesn't overshadow anything. There's no bombast or leitmotif to be found, but the music is so integral to the plot that you can't imagine the movie without it. Or not even with more of it, the balance is so fine.And to cap it all off, the voice acting is absolutely brilliant. This is what I long to hear, a return to the days when people were matched to roles that they could play, not a parade of Hollywood ""talent"" who tries to buy viewers with recognition and star power. Song of the Sea is loaded with people who can actually ACT in their voices alone, and from the adults straight down to the child actors who play the roles of the protagonist pair, every one is a standout.Honestly, I haven't seen an animated film this heartfelt and earnest since The Lion King, which is probably one of the last times that a studio really just threw their cards on the table and said ""let's see what we can really do to tell a story"". Song of the Sea hasn't and won't gross well at the box office by Hollywood standards - which is a true shame, because I can't think of a film from 2014 that more deserves to be seen."
1,Song of the Sea,10,11 July 2015,Really does cast an enchantingly intoxicating spell on anyone watching,"Song of the Sea is perhaps known best for being one of the films nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar, and after seeing the film it's easy to see why. It's a beautiful and enchanting film, and one of the strongest of the nominees of what was mostly a solid line-up (one where even the weakest of the nominees, The Boxtrolls, had a lot of fine things about it). And as well-done a film The Secret of Kells is, to me Song of the Sea is the superior film, having connected more with the story.Song of the Sea is so wonderfully animated, the character designs have a real charm without being too cute or stereotyped, but even better are the breathtakingly beautiful colours and very handsomely detailed and at its best magical background art. The music score is equally striking, the melancholic and lilting Celtic sound fitting so well and hauntingly with the story's emotional mood. The film contains a beautifully written script, thoughtful, poignant and with many nuances.That the story was so easy to connect with was yet another thing that Song of the Sea excelled so well at, it doesn't try to do too much, for one as layered and rich as this one, nor does it feel too slight for the running time. The atmosphere is enchanting, but it was the emotional impact that was even more resonant, it is a subject very easy to identify with and the most emotional parts were just heart-breaking. The characters are interesting and engaging, Ben starts off a little stereotypical but goes through a significant amount of character growth throughout the film that it becomes far easier to warm to him. The voice work is fine, with an admirably nimble Brendan Gleeson and a charming and emotive Lucy O'Connell being particularly strong while David Rawle portrays Ben's development and emotions very believably as well.All in all, outstanding film and really does cast an enchantingly intoxicating spell on anyone who has the fortune to watch it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
2,Song of the Sea,10,10 January 2015,Song Of The Sea is a triumph of design and animation.,"From the Academy Award-nominated director of The Secret of Kells ""Tomm Moore""This visually stunning animation masterwork, steeped in Irish myth, folklore and legend,Perfect balance of fantasy & real life.A sweet journey of love and loss through Celtic mythology with a unique animation style that I've come to love,Song Of The Sea is a triumph in design and animation,The story was rich and quite impressive as well but after you see this film you'll be thinking about how amazing and beautiful it was.Song Of The Sea gets a 10/10 from me and is well worth to be seen in theaters."
3,Song of the Sea,10,22 February 2015,Irish folklore comes alive in a masterpiece of traditional animation,"Our story begins with a pregnant mother giving her first-born son Ben  a young boy  a conch shell so that he can hear the sea and be reminded of the mystical Irish folktales she has shared with him. When she disappears into the sea after giving birth to a daughter Saoirse ('Seer-Sha'), the story fast-forwards 6 years into the future where we find a broken family. The father and devoted lighthouse-keeper (voiced by Brendan Gleeson) is distraught and empty after the loss of his wife, Saoirse has yet to utter a word and is thought to be mute, and Ben would sooner be in the company of his loyal dog Cu than mind his little sister like he is supposed to.The night their meddling grandmother comes to try and take the children away to the city, young Saoirse is led by an illuminating force to a coat among her absent-mother's belongings and subsequently wanders into the ocean where she is transformed into a seal. We later find out that she is part selkie  a magical being that is capable of such transformation. Finding her human again and washed up along the beach asleep (and having come down with a cold), the grandmother sees no alternative other than to 'rescue' the children from such a hostile environment and proceeds to take Ben and Saoirse to Dublin. Disheartened by their new home, the children quickly escape on a journey to find their way back to their father and the lighthouse. Along the way, Ben and Saoirse find themselves engulfed in many of the same fantastical stories their mother always talked about. Additionally Saoirse discovers her ability to tune into the spirit realm and nature through her gifts as a selkie and with the help Ben's conch shell.It's a story of love that is infused with rich mythology and folklore. Beautiful is a term that I seldom get to use as a cinephile, but beautiful is the only word I can use to describe Song of the Sea. Director/writer Tomm Moore has created a wondrous and vibrant style that immediately calls to mind the works of Hayao Miyazaki that Moore has cited as his personal inspiration. Whereas Miyazaki draws upon the wealth of his Japanese heritage to create internationally acclaimed works such as Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, Moore celebrates the folk stories of his native Ireland as he did in his 2009 Oscar nominated film The Secret of Kells. With Song of the Sea, we get tales of spirits, selkies, fairies and the like that seems as if they've been immortally captured in a children's storybook and jazzed up with a modern family drama. Moore's animations are infused with Celtic designs and an eerie mysticism that seem as if a painting has come to life before your eyes. There is something absolutely enchanting in the way Moore and his animation company Cartoon Saloon are able to use traditional animation to tell such a compelling story. The characters are engaging and the story is both poignant and inspiring, but the real beauty in this film is the swirling palettes of color that captivate the audience with each passing frame. Set aside all that digital garbage and be refreshed by a style of animation that is truly magical.I tried to think of the perfect descriptor for this film, but the best I could come up with is to liken it to the equally beautiful film Pan's Labyrinth if it were a Studio Ghibli film. It has dark elements, a timeless and engrossing story, and an aesthetic mastery that will see you through these otherwise barren months of cinema.Read the full review and others like it on the Drive-in Zeppelin website"
4,Song of the Sea,10,12 October 2014,Magical,"When one loses their feelings, they risk turning to stone. Selkies, magical beings that change from seals to humans, have the power to reverse such changes. This is because selkies are in touch with nature, love and the ancient way of things. However, selkies cannot make the changes by themselves. They need help from humans. A little girl, Saoirse, is a selkie. Saoirse attempts to keep her family from turning to stone. Her family is prone to grief and selfishness. They do not reveal their hearts to others. Saoirse's task becomes all the more difficult when her mother, also a selkie, strangely disappears in the night. And through no fault of her own, Saoirse's voice vanishes as well. On top of this, strangers who already lost their emotions for good, try to make Saoirse lose hope. Will her father, older brother and grandmother, all preoccupied with their own concerns, help or turn away? The beautiful, spell binding and intricate animation of this film includes the Northern lights, sunrises and surreal underwater worlds. The singular theme of the film underscores the truth that stories, emotions, animals and nature connect us to our better selves and to each other. From the director of the spectacular, award winning Secret of Kells. Seen at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival."
5,Song of the Sea,10,19 March 2015,Let the song of the sea sway your heart..:),"Amazing artwork and amazing story! I must say this movie has a story to tell that will work up to your emotion just like sea touching a stone and fills it with life. Music is great! The use of color and environment is so vivid and well thought. ""Song of the sea"" takes you into a emotional and adventurous journey with Saoirse and Ben. I strongly recommend to watch this animated movie. If you are a fan of animation you will simply love it. I've watched quite a lot of work of Studio Ghibli. 2D work like this is rare to come by these days. Wonderful creation! You should make movies like this and unlock a part of us which has been lost in the waves of time. Thank you. :)"
6,Song of the Sea,9,7 February 2015,Amazing fairy tale told with brilliant animation,"Whenever I see a movie like this, it makes me wish that 3D animation was not so dominate in popularity.Ben is a small boy who goes on a journey with his sister, Saoirse to reunited her with the last gift their mother granted her before passing, which will give her the ability to sing a song that can save all the creatures from their mother's fairy tales.The Irish are rich with stories and fairy tales of mythical creatures. It was awesome to see one of those takes come to life in the most beautiful animation.So well done, it was like a painting coming to life.This was one of the best animated movies I see in a while. I can see how it was nominated for an Oscar. Absolutely worth watching."
7,Song of the Sea,8,29 March 2015,"So emotional traditional Irish story ,, brilliantly produced :)","The songs and the music is so magical it takes you so deep in the ocean and so high up the Irish highlands traditional stories.The Oscar nomination was no foul, for me it is as good as Big Hero 6 but maybe the latter has more Action,, yet the storyline and plot here is tighter and more intriguing.There were some Irish sentences where i'm lost .. couldn't get few words ;) :D but i lived for a while up in Glasgow, Scotland so i kinda got used to these mysteriously ""charming"" accents ;)Don't keep your emotions sealed in jars :) It's been really so long since i'v watched an Animated movie with so much heightened emotions :) In the final scene i really felt like crying ...Overall it's recommended , hope you enjoy it guys ;)"
8,Song of the Sea,10,29 March 2015,The Myth Buster,It is generally accepted that only Disney can do animation with strong musical themes. Wrong.It is generally accepted that only Japan can produce superior animation.Wrong.It is generally accepted that FINDING NEMO was the best animated story about the sea.Wrong.The other IMDb reviewer who said this could be the best animated feature ever made may not be wrong. It is one of a kind.I could go on but hopefully you get the point.Wonderful. Enchanting. Magical. Perfect.I couldn't even hit the PAUSE button.
9,Song of the Sea,,1 February 2015,Simply beautiful: I defy you not to love it!,"""My son, remember me in your stories and in your songs. Know that I will always love you, always."" Mother BronaghA good kids' animation will usually include some well-known motifs such as in Hansel and Gretel and The Wizard of Oz; Tomm Moore's Song of the Sea does. However, this is no ordinary animation: It swirls with pastels that morph into imaginative lines capturing humans and faeries as if the world supported both in their glory and despair--a phantasmagoric hot mess if you will. As he did in his first spectacular animation, the Secret of Kells, Moore hand draws (without the aid of computer) a maritime story about Ireland, not some nebulous Neverland.Despite the imaginative, albeit almost primitive visuals, the story hammers home some important themes, especially for kids: the challenges of an older brother with a younger sister and the loss of a parent inducing depression to cause muteness. In addition, the interaction of a domineering grandma with small children plays a part as the filmmakers accurately target the challenges of growing up for any child.In this Oscar-nominated tale set in 1987, Saoirse (voice of Lucy O'Connell), a mute child living in a lighthouse with her tormenting older brother, suffers the loss of mother, who is actually one of the Selkies (women in Scottish and Irish legend who change from seals to people while hiding their sealness). So, too, little Selkie Saoirse, who struggles to bring back mother from the sea and deal with grumpy grandma at the same time.Saoirse's responsibility is to save all the fairy creatures from the modern world. Besides meeting an array of eccentric characters, she helps her bro learn to love her, and dad to accept the loss of his wife. If the story is not new enough for you, then relax with visuals that will hypnotize in their simplicity of execution and complexity of theme.Then you can also consider how this 6 million dollar movie beats the heck out of major studio productions costing twenty times that."
10,Song of the Sea,9,19 February 2015,"Boasting beautiful traditional animation and a nice Celtic brother-sister story, Song of the Sea is a nice fantasy","A vacation to a recurring place, like that cabin in the mountains you visit once a year, is one of those nostalgic memories that you treasure so much that you'll try hard to recreate it when your turn comes to be a parent. For most, there are either mountain people or beach people; one set enjoys the sea air and playing in the sand while there are those that prefer the smell of pine and the wide openness of nature. I've had the privilege to have both, though I consider myself more of a beach guy.One place that my parents would take my brother and I (and still do to this day) is the lovely Laguna Beach. The conflicting scents of sunscreen and ocean water give me such a relaxing buzz that I can't help but feel that the sea itself calls to me. Being about to observe the tide corals and touch them, as well as sticking my feet in the water just seems to define Southern California. It's such a laid back atmosphere and it's something that I hope to observe more in the future. The call of the ocean is the subject in Song of the Sea. It's set in Ireland where we find a family living on an island in a lighthouse where a young boy named Ben loves his life with his lighthouse keeper father and his mother whose ready to give birth to a daughter. One night she disappears into the sea but the daughter is born safely. The father becomes distant from his kids out of guilt that he couldn't have saved his wife, leaving young Ben to care for his sister. Six years later, the girl, named Saoirse, has yet to speak and easily frustrates Ben as he's remained fearful of the ocean water and forbids her to enter it. The two are your typical brother sister set who tend to fight and play pranks on each other, even though Ben is usually the troublemaker. Their grandmother comes to visit on Saoirse's birthday and tries again to persuade her son to let the grandkids come live with her. Things seem to go fine until Saoirse finds her mothers seashell that was given to Ben. She finds that when she plays it, a magical force leads her to find a coat where upon wearing in the sea, will allow her to turn into a seal. The incident convinces the father the kids might be better off and send them to their grandmother. The kids don't like the arrangement and set off to return to the lighthouse while coming across some other mysterious Celtic legends. The team behind this picture also made the previously Oscar nominated Secret of the Kells. As with their last film, Song of the Sea is beautifully hand drawn, which is something we really need more of. Some say that computer animation is all what people want, but I think if marketed well, this would have done as well as a regular Disney movie (maybe not Frozen levels, but a lot).As a story, Song of the Sea is a nice coming of age story that nicely shows a genuine relationship of brother and sister. A lot of the brother-sister sets we see are usually fighting or really close, yet this one is a bit a both, and because of that, feels more real. I too would be just as stressed should my sibling have never talked. The legends of giants turning into stone islands, trolls living in cities and owl witches are fun to hear about and have a timeless quality that more Americans should hear about. That might be the Irish ancestry inside of me but what are young gonna do?I'll give this nine seashell flutes out of ten. Song of the Sea has plenty of mysterious fantasy without any unnecessary pandering that one might receive from Nickelodeon. This is a film a highly recommend to not just families, but to those that have had a sibling."
11,Song of the Sea,,19 March 2015,Sweet,"It's so great that such a small film like this will now get seen because it got nominated for an Oscar, whereas if it had not it would've gone very much underseen. I have to start off by saying that while the voice acting here is decent (surprisingly a little underacting by Brendan Gleeson), the sound mixing and sound editing is truly spectacular. At times the sounds were so real that if I closed my eyes I would really believe I was near the ocean. The animation as well, for being an independent film, is truly beautiful. Simple, but the colors are really vivid and strong and they have a great effect. Overall, the film is just gentle and joyous and so hard to dislike. It's a bit light, but harmless."
12,Song of the Sea,7,28 October 2014,Hopefully a contender for an animation Oscar nomination.,"Director Tomm Moore's followup to his Oscar nominated debut The Secret  of Kells certainly has the potential to follow in its footsteps if it  can reach enough of an audience. Song of the Sea adapts the Selkie  legends and takes them one step further. I'm quite familiar with the  story having spent the last year of my degree writing a short film  about it, but Songsubverts the mythological and tells a sequel of  sorts. The story is essentially Beauty and the Beastplus The Little  Mermaid, wherein seals turn to women and fall in love with men on the  land, staying with them until they are called back to the sea.  Beginning at the end of the tale, the mother Selkie, who has wedded a  human fisherman and already had a baby boy with him, is pregnant once  more. About to give birth, she relents that she has to go back to sea  and sacrifices herself to leave a baby girl to the remaining family. It  jumps six years into the future. The older brother, Ben, resents his  younger and mute sister, Saoirse, for their mother having to leave them  for good. At odds between their home by the rough treacherous sea and  their fussy Grandma who wants them to live in the city, they're forced  away from their distraught father (voiced charmingly by Brendan  Gleeson) and their dog to live with her.  Immediately reluctant to settle, they begin their journey home and  discover that the ancient stories and characters their mother told them  are true. As a half-Selkie, Saoirse has the power to save a race of  trolls turned to stone, and Ben has the responsibility of making sure  she meets their goal. The theme is overt, bottling up emotions turns  you to stone, but the truth in that is powerful. There's a very  delicate storybook quality to the film. Perhaps mostly due to the  simplistic and now refreshing 2D animation style that glitters  beautifully with its swirls, but also in the episodic way the story  unfolds. It is quite pedestrian in its traditions and obviously  contrived in its storytelling, one ostensibly accessible for children,  but the emotional honesty and depth of the characters make it engaging.  It has at least a sprightly spirit of adventure.  Granted, side characters are often eccentric for the sake of being  eccentric. Though they do have the type of elasticity we haven't seen  since the Disney films of the 60s and 70s after they've become more  reserved in the 90s. The elegant style owes a debt to Ghibli films, but  I'm not a big fan of Hayao Miyasaki outside of his craft and I  preferred this more identifiable approach to the fantasy. Fortunately,  among all the fantastical elements it has a very grounded sense of  humour rather than an often irritatingly quirky one that a film like  Frozen boasts and it makes it a much easier film to invest in. With its  overwhelming ending, endearing characters, and lovely Celtic music,  Song Of The Sea a thoroughly pleasant and poignant experience. The film  won't be big enough to contend for the Oscar win, but with any luck  we'll see it on the shortlist and in the top five.  7/10"
13,Song of the Sea,6,10 April 2015,"Great visuals, but so-so story.","Like most hand-drawn animations, they are often quite the treat to look upon, this is no different. It uses a ""watercolors"" type aesthetic although much cleaner. I wouldn't say it's the same as anime, but it share some similarities, like how the backgrounds are usually hand-drawn and the characters are drawn digitally (they still fit very well into the scene though, which I can't say for some anime's).The story takes inspiration from Irish folklore, primarily with the ""Selkie"". A creature who becomes a seal in water but human on land. One of the two main characters, an odd mute girl is one of these creatures.The folklore inspiration work quite well, however as far as the story goes - It leaves a little to be desired. It seems somewhat uninspired without anything to make it truly stand out. It'll probably make an excellent kids movie, and one that is very gender neutral. I have however seen much more sophisticated storytelling within these kinds of movies. It's not at all bad - just.. bland. The visuals though are still enough to warrant seeing this movie if find them appealing."
14,Song of the Sea,10,29 May 2015,562nd Review: Oscar Contending Masterpiece,"Song of the Sea is a singularly exceptional film. It hides complexity in both story and fabulous art behind a simple, beguiling tale of two children, Saoirse and Ben, their father, Connor, their mother Bronach, and a very adorable dog, Cu, who struggle to cope with loss, and find in magical realism a way to understand and find the world afresh.Using superb metaphors and meaning from Irish folktales and legends the film can be viewed on one level simply as an adventurous fairy tale set in modern times, but viewed deeply, it speaks deeply to the human condition; and for this viewer is one of the most singular films of the decade. It is fun, funny, and sorrowful and, importantly, as unpatronising as children themselves. It is totally suited to all ages, including very small children, who will adore the seals and Cu, and adults, and even teenagers, who may be enticed to see something more. It is this aspect of understanding the human condition in Tomm Moore's film that lifts it from another animated film to the absolute finest cinema. Yet he does so with such a light touch that many viewers will accept the magical realism and simply enjoy the charm and whimsy and be swept along. However, it also poignantly asks if happiness can exist without sorrow, and given the choice, would we want to live without either or both, and does so with some terrific touches. In addition, here is a world of sublime artistic technical skill and excellent voice acting - the film is hand-drawn and was 4 years in the making - the detailing with swirls and lines in the backgrounds and the tiny movements, while still keeping a simply line drawn animation, deserves multiple viewings. Tomm Moore has with this and Secret of Kells turned Irish animation into a world class powerhouse. This is not American or Japanese, Moore has successfully defined in two films, a unique approach that marries Celtic line art with simple 2D animation and a non-vibrant colour palette and has created a new school of animation.This is a great film - several critics pounced on Kells for a lack of a defined story, here they cannot possibly complain: the interweaving of Irish legends with the modern day, is both inspired and strong. Also strong is a wonderful sly sense of humour and real, not forced, emotion. It is both entertaining and deep - and works.Finally, it is the meaning and value of family and above all, the place of the mother, that makes Song of the Sea exceptional - I have seen few other film that explores loss with such wonderful metaphors as this, and certainly none as beautiful and with such a light touch as this. It is constantly surprising, full of wonder, and is, in the best sense, simply magical. Above all, it never defines where reality ends and magic begins and that is its real magic."
15,Song of the Sea,6,3 March 2015,Anyone else think this doesn't actually make any sense?,"Song of the Sea has beautiful visuals throughout and is always a treat to look at. It's an intimate fantasy tale of a family living in the wake of their mother having went into the sea because she's a creature thing to become a creature thing. Now the brother and sister must get back home from their Grandmother's house and also solve the fantasy thing because the girl is a Selkie (half-seal) like her Mom was. This movie didn't really make sense to me.Watching the movie is a nice experience because the images look like well-crafted, detailed drawings like a painting from a children's book. But beneath these visuals is a story that feels like it makes enough sense to pass off, but I can't figure out why anything really happened. To put it best, this movie made up its own rules as it went along. It's like someone is telling you a bedtime story that they're just making up as they go along. It lacks proper stakes and explanations for why things in its fantasy world are the way they are. I'm not just trying to nitpick, here. Towards the beginning, I was getting a hint that this story didn't have anything at stake. They want to get home, and separately, the girl is discovering that she is a seal creature. With this discovery, which happens out of nowhere, she has a task. What is this task? She has to un-stone creatures and fairies from this fantasy world that she meets as if she is a chosen one, but she isn't. We don't know why they want her specifically or what she is getting from them by doing this. We don't know what it means for her to be a Selkie. We do know that she is going to die for some reason if she doesn't do it. So what are her tasks for accomplishing this? The one thing that makes sense is that she has to get a coat from her house, but most of the story is the two siblings wandering wherever in this fantasy world. She has to follow some little shiny things and then she'll solve the fantasy thing. I call it the ""fantasy thing"" because she's not really solving anything at all. She's just going on a thing that she needs to do because the movie said so. There's a shell that she plays that makes bad things go away when convenient, established by the movie when needed. There's a water portal in a house in the middle of nowhere that leads to a guy whose beard grows and I guess each strand tells a story. I don't know what this guy did for the story or for the characters. There are seals who help the characters ride to where they need to go in the ocean just because. The pieces in this story add up to what looks like a proper film but they don't actually make any sense, and therefore mean nothing. Unlike other fantasies, this one establishes its rules on the spot and without any grounding. By the end of the movie, I had realized that no explanation was coming for me, and that this movie simply didn't make sense. I can't say, however, that it was unpleasant to watch. The characters, while not that developed, were nice to watch and had loving relationships with one another that gives the movie some emotion. The score, I should mention, is very very good. I had a warm feeling while watching much of it, but it's hard for me not to be weighed down by its lack of making any sort of sense, and I have a hard time believing that apparently no critics see this."
16,Song of the Sea,5,13 July 2016,Expects you to know a lot about Selkies going in,"First off, I myself found this movie pretty boring. It's a story about a boy whose sister is a Selkie (a mythological seal person which I knew absolutely nothing about this myth going in and that hampered the movie immensely)Yes, I understand that this is an Irish movie, and I am sure that every kid in Ireland knows the mythology of Selkies, but as an American....I never learned about Selkies and this story does a TERRIBLE job explaining what they are. They tell you some facts, but leave a lot to 'you should have done your research before you started watching this'. This type of story is when a 'fish out of water' protagonist would have worked. But because everyone in the story knows what Selkies are, they don't feel the need to explain it. The main character finally gets the revelation and goes 'you're a selkie!' and i am there going 'that's fantastic.....what's a selkie?' The only reason I had any idea what was going on with the lore of this was because I watched this with my sister and she informed me the rules of Selkies that she learned from A different movie entirely. That is one of the places where the movie falls incredibly flat. You can't introduce such a foreign concept and just assumes everyone will know it because it is premiered in that country. If you wish to have a worldwide audience, you have to explain your lore thoroughly so no one gets left behind.Other than that, I really didn't care for any of the characters. The girl was quiet and annoying, the boy was uninteresting, and the mother was a terrible terrible person. I know everyone is heralding this movie as wonderful and beautiful, but I have to say that I didn't really enjoy it. I was too confused about the mythology and the characters weren't interesting enough to draw me in. The father was a jerk and the kids were boring. It wasn't a TERRIBLE movie I just....didn't care. And that's almost worse than being bad. I'm probably going to get a negative response as I didn't give this movie an amazing score, but, I can't help how I feel. I didn't enjoy it and a 5 is exactly what I feel it deserves."
17,Song of the Sea,9,16 July 2015,Breathtaking Animation and An Emotional Story,"From the opening sounds as we first hear the hypnotic ""Song of the Sea"" it is clear that this film is something special. It's a Celtic song that a pregnant mother sings to her 4 year old son to tell the tale of the Selkie, a mystical creature with the power to live as a seal at sea and human on land with the ability to carry the spirits across the oceans. Shortly after this he wakes to find his father clutching his new born sister in his arms, with his mother disappeared.6 years later, the young boy named Ben (David Rawle) has grown to be a grumpy child who has been raised by his father Conor (Brendan Gleeson), neither of whom have been able to get over the loss of a mother and a wife. He's raised along with his sister Saoirsie who has yet to speak a single word despite nearly reaching six years old. But the relationship between Ben and his sister is troubled, as he often treats her with much disdain and distance. He loves his sister as any brother would, but blames her for the loss of his mother at the same time causing him to to act out at times. This difficult situation leads to the children's grandmother (Fionnula Flanagan) to take them to the city of Dublin, away from the lighthouse and the sea in the hope of having them finally recover. But Ben misses his home, with the lighthouse being one of the few things left to connect him to his mother and sets off to journey home. On his journey he encounters the mystic creatures of Irish folk lore that he was enamoured with as a child from giants made of stone to an aged creature who contains the memories of every mystic creature in his long beard. From these creatures Ben discovers that his sister is a selkie and he must return her to the sea so she can sing the selkie's song to release the souls of the mystic creatures.Unlike the standard computer animated films that have become too commonplace, Song of the Sea is lovingly drawn with hand drawn animation. It's truly imaginative in its visuals at times creating beauty in the mundane through creating the streets of Dublin and having gorgeous bright lights engulfing the town at night. At others it creates the mystic land of the sea and the sight of the seals swimming majestically against the rough waves or giants emerging from the ocean's depths. It is constantly beautiful and carries with it stunning attention to detail bringing the world to life through incredible touches including dust particles floating in the sunlight, creating a world to behold through its more traditional take on animation. Whilst the film explores the entirety of Celtic legend, the core of the film remains its characters and how they deal with their bereavement and depression. Each character deals with their pain in a different way with some removing their emotions entirely due to not being able to handle them any longer or becoming obsessed with the past when they were happy. With this we get great emotional depth from all the characters as we can understand and even possibly relate to all the pain that they are going through. But the centre relationship is the heartwarming relationship between Ben and his sister. He is going through a difficult period of his life, at times being selfish and even cruel because of his his reeling from the loss of his mother. But as the film goes on we watch many beautiful scenes where we see he is a brother willing to go any length to save his sister.I could draw all kinds of comparisons about this films to other animated gems. I could say that it has the sense of childlike wonder that you see in a Disney film. I could say that the film delivers the same spirit of adventure of a Ghibli film. But comparisons like this do the film a disservice. This film stands in its own right delivering a unique animation style and focus on Irish culture not quite like any I've seen before. It is truly a masterpiece."
18,Song of the Sea,10,2 July 2015,Where to begin... THIS is what animation should be doing,"Let me begin with saying: Song of the Sea is hands down the best animated film of 2014 and probably one of the best animated movies in the last... 80 years. Song of the Sea does what a lot of animators have forgotten what animation does: It does what real-life can't. It tells stories. IT HAS MAGIC IN THE DRAWINGS.Just looking at Song of the Sea is amazing in itself. While a lot of animated movies will set a nice looking atmosphere, rarely is every shot a piece in itself. Song of the Sea is beautiful in EVERY shot. There is not a single shot that hasn't been carefully constructed. And this is just one of the many great elements of this animation. Even without its good story-telling and great soundtrack, it is still one of the most beautiful animations to date. Now, the story itself can be a little bit confusing without a little prior knowledge on Irish mythology, but the movie explains most of what is needed to be known. The one advantage this movie has in story-telling is that the whole film is treated like a classic fairy-tale. Things sort of just... happen... and fall into place. This isn't done in a lazy way, but it is done in a very dream-like way so the story just naturally flows. This may sound weird, but upon viewing it it will make more sense what I'm trying to say. This effect is created mostly through minimal dialogue. There are certain spans of time in the movie where no one talks for five minutes or so. And this isn't just one scene, the movie consistently lacks dialogue and tells its story mostly through visuals. I will say this as a mild warning: THIS FILM IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.Because the film tells its story almost entirely through visuals and minimal dialogue, I could imagine it dragging for some people. This isn't the kind of animated film that uses animation to tell jokes, it is the kind of animated film that wants you to get lost in its world.On an additional note, the movie's soundtrack is very good. It is gentle, quite, and peaceful, without ever getting too big and bold. This helps keep the atmosphere consistent.Lastly, I will say what makes me even happier about this film is that it was made on a micro-budget compared to Disney, yet made an infinitely better animated film than Disney (or even Studio Ghibli) has made in some years. This movie proves that hard work, dedication, and simple beauty, can make one of the most visually impressive animated films in quite some time, and yet it still has a small budget. This proves that budget doesn't make an animated film look good.Long story short, I won't talk about the details of this masterpiece, but I will conclude that I hope to see more animated films from Tomm Moore... A LOT MORE animated films.A true inspiration for fellow animators."
19,Song of the Sea,9,8 February 2015,An Irish Gem,"Greetings again from the darkness. Fans of animation can expect to experience a bit of nostalgia as they treasure the rare hand-drawn works of animator Tomm Moore. However, Mr. Moore's artistry may even be exceeded by his extraordinary story telling ability. This gem from Ireland is an Oscar nominee for Best Animated Feature, as was Mr. Moore's The Secret of Kells (a runner-up that year to Up). It's a top notch family movie filled with adventure, fantasy, emotion and characters worth caring about.Young Ben lives an ideal life with his lighthouse caretaker father, pregnant mother, and beloved dog Cu on an isolated island. Ideal that is, until the ""Bambi's mother"" moment, which 6 years later, finds Ben's dad still in mourning, while Ben flashes animosity and blame towards his mute little sister, Saoirse (pronounced Sir-sha). What we as viewers soon learn is that cute little Saoirse is a selkie  just like her mother was. Irish and Scottish legend states that selkies can transform themselves from people to seals, and have a real connection with the sea and the fairy world.When the over-bearing, know-it-all granny decides that an island is no place to raise kids, she moves Ben and Saoirse to the big city  sans dog and dad. Of course, this is a terrible idea and the two kids are soon enough off on an adventure of self-discovery and rescue. They run into 3 of the remaining fairies who know that selkie Saoirse is their only hope with her magic sea shell (from her mom) and her as yet undiscovered singing voice. It turns out the songs Ben's mom taught him, when sung by Saoirse, can free the souls of the fairies turned to stone by the evil owl witch Macha. The real fun is in the details of their adventure.Moore's story has the feel of an ancient folk tale and legend, with a dose of mythology. Since the story coincides with Halloween, it also adds an additional element of creatures, real vs pretend. As you can see, the story is no mindless cartoon. It contains much emotion tied to the brother/sister battles, the loss of a parent, nosy relatives, and the path of discovering one's own self  even through the eyes of children. Terrific voice work comes courtesy of Brendan Gleeson, Fionnula Flanagan, David Rawle (Ben), and Lucy O'Connell (Saoirse). It's a timeless story that, amongst other things, is a legitimate Oscar contender while reminding brothers to be nice to their sister!"
20,Song of the Sea,10,6 January 2016,Just beautiful,"I have downloaded the movie a long time ago but i didn't have the time to see it. Two days ago i had one of my worst asthma attack ever.. it was a mess & I was completely down. I thought i should cheer up a little bit and watch a funny movie, but the truth is, if i didn't watch this beautiful, just beautiful movie i wouldn't be in this peaceful condition right now.this movie lift you up and take you to another world where everything is just beautiful, simple and astonishingly pure. It's one of the movie that can make you feel better about yourself and know that holding the sadness inside wont do any good. It provide you with a lot of positive energy to be tolerant to whatever is happening in the world.I'm really thankful to those who created such a beautiful movie."
21,Song of the Sea,,24 June 2015,One of the few remaining hopes for traditional animation,"It's good to know that even in the new 10s, we can still get traditionally animated films of this quality, after even Disney has given up on them. Song of the Sea is of course done with a smaller budget, but you honestly couldn't tell, mostly because the animation style is so simplistically beautiful and partly because of the skill of the animators.Like their previous film, The Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea is heavily rooted in Irish folklore and mythology, which is exactly the right choice because we're once again treated to an amazingly deep, layered and emotionally mature story. This time our story follows the life of a young girl named Saoirse (Lucy O'Connell). Her mother was called away when she was born and now she's living on a small island with her dad, Conor (Brendan Gleeson), and brother Ben (David Rawle). Yet she has never uttered a single word in her life, and slowly the past of her mother and the secrets of her own origin start to unravel.Song of the Sea shines because of the complexity and personality of its characters. You're instantly pulled into the mythology of Ireland and the film is very skilled in explaining and showing the intricacies of its lore without shoving it down our throats. The various mythic characters are especially interesting, threatening, sympathetic and intriguing, all at the same time.Yet the movie's biggest problem are also some of its characters. Mainly the children. Saoirse is fine, even if a bit passive to my liking, but Ben is simply annoying. He's very much your stereotypical whiny little brat, who thinks he's entitled. And yeah, there are good reasons for it, one of them simply being that he's at that age, but it's still annoying. I wouldn't even complain all that much, but there is a way to make an annoying brat without it being annoying to the viewers.But, luckily Ben has his redeeming qualities as well, so it's nowhere near enough to ruin the film. Song of the Sea is absolutely worth a watch if you liked The Secrets of Kells or if you're still looking for new traditionally animated films."
22,Song of the Sea,7,17 November 2016,"Enchanting, imaginative and quite beautiful animated film from Ireland","I was already aware of the work of the director of this film, Tomm Moore, when I saw his previous animated feature film The Secret of Kells (2009). That film like this one was very distinctive in that it was based around Irish folklore. It is highly encouraging to see a nation not really associated with much cinema output like Ireland start to release their own unique animated movies. As it turned out, both of these films got additional visibility by being nominated for Oscars at the Academy Awards, so it seems like the Irish have certainly hit on something here and I hope that more such features emerge from the Emerald Isle in the future.The Song of the Sea is another animated fantasy-adventure. It focuses on a boy and his little sister, the latter of which is a Seal child, also known as a Selkie. They live in a lighthouse on a small island with their dad, their mother having died while giving birth to the daughter. Despite being almost six years old, the little girl has never uttered a single word, alienating her from her brother. But soon the mysteries of her origins begin to emerge and strange events follow.Like Moore's last film this is another that has been made using traditional animation methods, i.e. its hand drawn. This pleases me a lot as this type of animation always seems to have more soul that CGI. The whole thing is awash with great Celtic art and it really feels like every frame is constructed with consummate care. The story tells of primal things like the call of the ocean and interweaves this with imaginative fantasy creations such as an Owl Witch. Although it has to be said that I thought some of its best and most atmospheric moments were during the domestic scenes such as the parts set in Dublin. Whatever the case, the beautiful art-work creates a feeling all of its own. I have to admit to not being entirely drawn in by the characters though, with the boy Ben being somewhat irritating to be quite honest. If I had made more of a connection with the characters then I would have rated this one higher no doubt. Nevertheless, this is a lovely piece of animation which climaxed with a sequence of extraordinary beauty when the little girl sings the 'Song to the Sea'. I have to admit it put a lump in my throat and was genuinely emotional and beautiful. This ending alone is worth watching the movie for. All-in-all, this has to go down as a creative triumph."
23,Song of the Sea,10,6 November 2016,Under the sea.,"Whilst being aware of the latest CGI extravaganzas from the US,and the delicate beauty of Studio Ghibli,I started to hear about an animated title from Ireland,which appeared to have come completely from out of nowhere.Getting the very lucky opportunity to be the host of an event taking place on IMDb's Film Festivals board,I was thrilled to discover that film was one of the main festival viewings,which led to me getting ready to hear the sea sing.The plot:Living in a lighthouse,Ben,his dog Cú,his dad Conor and mum Bronagh welcome Saoirse into the family.One night, Bronagh tells the family that she loves them,and disappears into the ocean.Over the years Conor continues to mourn Bronagh's (presumed) death,as Saoirse goes mute and Ben blames her for the disappearance of their mum.On Saoirse's birthday Ben tells her a scary folk tale about an Owl Witch who take people's feelings and turns them into stone. Playing with a seashell Bronagh gave Ben, Saoirse finds a coat.Going to the ocean where her mum disappeared, Saoirse puts the coat on and transforms into a Selkie.View on the film:Proudly being a square peg that will never fit in a round hole,co- writer/(along with Will Collins) director Tomm Moore weaves a magical world with all of the characters and surroundings have pointed edges,which along with subtly expressing the rough edges of their lives,also give Ben and the family quirky designs which sharply capture the grief they have for Bronagh.Going under the sea, Moore splashes in waves of Psychedelic beauty. Produced between 4 animation studios across Europe, Moore blends the magnificent hand- drawn animation together seamlessly,with the collective approach bringing lush chalk coloured landscapes across the screen.Set on a canvas of Bruno Coulais rich score and Folk songs from Nolwenn Leroy and the band Kíla,the screenplay by Moore and Collins places the viewer in the midst of Saoirse and Ben's wonderment. Straying away from any needlessly dry exposition on the Folk legends,the writers instead present them as they are,which grip Saoirse and Ben's encounters with Færie's and Great Seanachaí's in an irresistible enchanting atmosphere. Breaking up the family in the opening scenes,the writers display extraordinary care in looking at the theme of parental loss,hitting the family hard,with Conor,Ben and Saoirse all in grief for Bronagh. Finely balancing the fantasy with the personal,the writers keep the fantastical discoveries Ben and Saoirse make be a part of their process with grief,as Conor,Ben and Saoirse hear Bronagh voice across the song of the sea."
24,Song of the Sea,10,20 March 2015,Beautiful,"Wow, where to start? This film was beautiful to look at and on so many other levels. It penetrates the viewer emotionally and mythically hitting right in the heart. I've never seen a film that manages to capture feeling so much. I think it's the beautiful color and music. About half way through this turned in to my favorite movie in a long while. I love that elements of Irish folklore are being brought to the screen considering the mythology and folklore of their civilization, despite being so powerful, is disregarded theatrically. I hope the films Tomm Moore is doing will inspire others to get involved in bringing this lost seed back to our lives. I tried to go deeper into this review but suffice to say I was just left in awe and don't really know what else to say but if you wonder if you should view it as I said the art is amazing and so is the story so all the elements for a joyful experience are there. I cried more than I've cried in years and I don't even really ever cry but it was tears of the sheer beauty I felt. This was a story that really captivated me and I was captured and my mind put in the rear view for the last hour."
25,Song of the Sea,5,30 March 2015,Little seal chick needs her coat to sing her enchanted song.,"The story is about a little girl who is related to fairy-tale creatures thru her mother and able to become a seal. She also has the ability to rejuvenate many creatures in nature thru the power of her song and so is viewed by them as their salvation. She needs to wear her special coat to work her magic, though, and as the movie progresses this becomes central to it's suspense and drama.After 30 mins or so of this my interest began to ebb. Notwithstanding, there was enough there to make me see it thru to the end. Personally I felt there wasn't enough here for an adult mind. Most, anyway. Unless this animation was strictly designed for kids 8 and under, I would say both story and artwork was, I think, too ""elementary"" in their construction. However, I wouldn't have minded the simple, flat, brittle, and abstract artwork (unlife-like in movement and appearance) if there was more creativity, cleverness, and complexity to the story-telling.That said, Reader, the irony is I wouldn't have minded the elementary story-telling so much if the artwork had given me something to gawk at. Hence, had been richer, more detailed and life-like as, for example, ""Ponyo"" which was for me pure eye-candy. It also dealt with magic and the sea. If you've seen Ponyo, you know what I mean. If you haven't, and you love animation, then you're wasting time with my review. You need to make tracks and get yourself a copy posthaste for your video library!!! I guarantee you pure pleasure. If you're able, may I suggest you lock yourself away with a large viewing screen with stereo headphones and have your favorite snack handy to take the experience to the next level. And if family and friends wonder what you're doing, let them speculate. ""Cadbury"", anyone? Love, Boloxxxi."
26,Song of the Sea,10,23 May 2015,Mere words may not be sufficient for this masterpiece.,"In a cinematic world where originality is becoming lackluster and CGI overused, along comes a hand-drawn animated movie that delves into an ancient legend not well known to American audiences. ""Song of the Sea"" is a tale derived from Irish folklore that not only brings in stunning visuals, but an emotional depth few can match. When I first heard about this film, I thought it was one of those short animated films you would find on youtube and upon further research (and watching the Awards on TV), I was surprised to find that it won an award alongside the likes of another animated hit ""Big Hero 6"". Further research into Irish lore is what eventually won me over into seeing ""Song of the Sea"" and take in an experience I haven't felt in a long time.After the mysterious disappearance of his mother, a young boy named Ben lives with his quiet little sister Saoirse (pronounced ""seer-sha"") and depressed father in a lighthouse. Despite his responsibility as a big brother, Ben is quite bitter towards his sister, but an unexpected change is on the horizon. As it turns out, Saoirse is a selkie, human on land and a seal in water, and her voice and musical ability has the power to restore the vitality of magical creatures. However, things become grim when the girl is not only separated from her seal coat (the source of her transformation and power), but her and Ben's grandmother moves them to the city. Things become more perilous when Macha the Owl Witch sets her sights on the siblings. Ben must now journey back home with his sister and reunite Saoirse with her coat before time runs out.From beginning to end, this film had a profound effect on me. The characters have so much depth to them that they seemingly become real. Ben is initially a rather unhappy person, often taking his frustrations out on poor Saoirse, but as his journey progresses, he learns what it means to be a true brother. Saoirse herself is my favorite character. Aside from having some fascinating powers, she conveys so much emotion through her facial expressions alone despite the fact that she does not speak. There's a great sense of innocence to her as no matter what adversity she's faced with, Saoirse brings warmth to nearly every scene she's in. Some of the side characters are also good, especially this one fellow named Seanachai, a Faerie whose hair contains memories of his kind. Eccentric yet still quite fun. Macha the Owl Witch is interesting to say the least, an antagonist whose motivations are understandable, though her methods of achieving them are less than agreeable. Definitely one who defied my expectations.Other elements of the film are done in spectacular fashion. The art style is simplistic and yet so full of detail and life that it's hard not to take your eyes off it. The underwater scenes are especially fantastic to look at, perfectly capturing the beauty and tranquility the sea has to offer. The land environments, from the cities to the forests, are not too shabby either and the bright mystical elements make an ideal contrast to some of the dark gloomy atmosphere. And then we have the music. This is a soundtrack I could listen to all day. The melody and rhythm of each song makes me feel both joyful and peaceful, especially the titular song. I also like this exploration of Irish lore, so full of interesting mythological figures and stories. Finally, the climax, which I won't spoil, is one of the best I've seen in any film, with all the aforementioned elements blending together in one heck of an emotional experience.What else is there to say about ""Song of the Sea"". The story, the characters, animation, music, etc., are all wonderfully brought to life. I actually almost teared up by the time the movie was over. That alone speaks volumes of the power of this fairy tale. There seriously needs to be more films like this out there. Check out this beautiful flick and enjoy the ride!"
27,Song of the Sea,10,21 May 2015,I rarely give movies a perfect 10.,"It's not everyday when a movie leaves you so entranced to the point your drunk on it for a few days after watching it. But somehow this movie really hit me. When I first saw The Secret of Kells some years back, I said; ""I want to see what else these people have in store"". Sure enough not to long afterward I heard that Song of the Sea was in production. At that point I was so hyped to see it. I didn't know if it was going to be better then Kells but somehow I knew that the film was going to be something special. But little did I know that Song of the Sea was going to completely blow my expectations. It's honestly hard to talk about this movie. But I guess if I had to sum it up in one word it would be; Beautiful. Everything about this movie is just beautifully handled and thought out. The characters, the story, the visuals, and it's even shot very well. You wouldn't expect that from an animation it being ""well shot"". Considering that in 2d animation the camera is just planted. But the backgrounds and the images really have crisp visual story telling.A lot of people are a little closed minded to this movie because of how unlikable Ben can be. To that I say; ""That was the point, duh""! Have any of you ever hear of a story arc? How boring and unsatisfying would the ending be if Ben was just a nice kid throughout the movie? Now for the problems with the movie. There was only one big problem with the movie. It was embarrassing to watch. Oh no, not because it was an unbearable or annoying, its because I feel embarrassed for most American animation.After watching this movie and then waking up and realizing that most American animation is mostly (not always) filled to brim with dull, sterile CG movies that are usually aimed strictly for kids. We see movies like; The Nut Job, Strange Magic, Alpha and Omega and list goes on forever. After watching Song of the Sea I just realized how ashamed I am of the animation industry in America. They need to step up their game.But enough of that. Overall just watch Song of the Sea. It's an indescribably wonder that deserves that all the attention it can get."
28,Song of the Sea,10,24 April 2015,Wonderful film ! !,"""A wonderful, wonderful film. My 9 year old son was entranced watching it. The animation was pure art. My top 3 films ever.

29,Song of the Sea,9,30 December 2017,"From the shell, the Song of the Sea. Neither quiet nor calm, yet searching for love again","After accomplishing wonders with The Secret of Kells, Tomm Moore and the people of Cartoon Saloon came back five years later with their second animated feature, Song of the Sea. Despite going under the radar in some countries, it was lauded by critics and got another Oscar nomination for best animated feature. As for my two cents, this once again trumps through visual storytelling and Gaelic culture, but it also contains more heart than that of Kells.Unlike Kells where it took place in ancient times, this film is set in modern times. It follows a family living on the lighthouse of an island where a young boy named Ben is happy with his father Conor and mother Bronaugh. One night while Bronaugh is soon to give birth to his sister, she vanishes into the sea while the daughter Saoirse is calmly born. Although unable to speak, Saoirse soon discovers that she is the last of the selkies, which are women in Irish legends that transform from seals into people. Along with Ben, they journey off to the sea to free the ancient fairy creatures trapped in the modern world.The most genuine aspect of Song of the Sea is the relation between Ben and Saoirse, as it feels very much like a typical albeit understandable sibling relationship. Although Ben is rather snooty to Saoirse throughout much of her life, it makes sense as he deals with the passing of his own loved one, who he felt Saoirse took her from her. However, as the film goes on and Ben and Saoirse subtly bond through their journey, not only does Ben improve as a brother, but he soon discovers why his mother left Saoirse alone to him and it really elevates the heartfelt emotional side of the movie. It's fine to be moody to your siblings as children, but you mustn't be so hard on them without thinking more about them, because there's a good chance they mean more to you than you take them granted for.Some characters are more stubborn and torn like Ben's dad and their granny, but it's no more for the fact that they either want what's best for their kin or are still dealing with a loss that affected them emotionally. However, the stand out characters are the mythical creatures such as the fairies, the goddess Macha, and the great Seanchai. Alongside offering their own quirks and distinct personalities through their looks and history, they all serve the plot on trying to either raise or subdue their folklore into the heavens to be free from such struggles, like being stuck on Earth.Speaking of folklore, the tales that the movie brings up are quite extraordinary. Aside from selfies, these tales contain all sorts of spirits that definitely feel as if they emerged from a children's storybook, complete with mystic and lavish Celtic designs. The way the story crafts them as entities soon to be faded unless they are restored from a lullaby in a dramatic tale of two children helps the film create a perfect contrast between reality and fantasy, not unlike Pan's Labyrinth but certainly more family friendly.Finally, the animation and music are just sublime. Along with simple but cute character designs, the character animation is quite smooth, the background are endlessly imaginative and even symbolic at times, the effects feel like a moving painting, and the use of color blends perfectly with the environments whenever needed for the scene. While dark blue is use phenomenally for sad and emotional scenes, there is always a light to create a sense of hope and wonder in such dark times. While the score is fun and upbeat from time to time, it can also be very heartbreaking when needed, and the main song feels like a lullaby that even an adult can listen to and feel comforted just by hearing it.If Studio Ghibli is seen as the modern legend of Japanese animation, than Cartoon Saloon has officially earned the title of the modern legend of Irish animation. By boasting creative artwork, well nuanced characters and a deep source for ancient Irish folklore, Song of the Sea is a refreshingly original and breathtaking tale just waiting to be talked about. I absolutely recommend this, not just to animation buffs and those interested in Irish culture, but even to those who once had moody but real relations with their siblings. It just might remind you of a time when you ratted on your siblings before realizing how much they really do mean to both you and the rest of your family, and this film will definitely feel reminiscent to you with its timeless appeal."
30,Song of the Sea,6,10 December 2017,"Better than Disney, more shallow than the Japanese","It's a pretty film, I imagine it goes well with children, though I found it slowly paced.Beautiful graphics, but in terms of story it doesn't compare to Ghibli. It talks a bit about Irish mythology (I guess? Celtic?), but you don't learn anything really.All these people saying how the film is super deep (for an animation! gosh, there ARE deep animations out there) never saw Princes Kaguya or, for example, the Wind Rises, Garden of Words, there are so many deeper Japanese animations.Bottomline: better than Disney (what isn't?), less funny than Pixar (but more beautifully animated), shallower than Ghibli. Now take your shot"
31,Song of the Sea,10,25 November 2017,Another beautiful animation from 'Cartoon Saloon',"This Irish animation opens of a remote island as Bronagh tells fairy tales to her young son Ben. She is heavily pregnant and suddenly states that she must leave. Six years later there is no sign of Bronagh; Ben is living with his father and Saoirse, the young sister who was born on the night his mother was last seen. Saoirse doesn't talk and Ben appears to resent her. On the night of her birthday she finds a strange coat in a locked chest; then she goes down to the sea and swims with the seals; it is clear that she is no ordinary child. In the morning she is found on the beach. Ben and Saoirse are taken to live in the city with their grandmother while their father puts the coat in the chest and throws it into the sea. Soon Ben decides to run away because he misses his dog; Saoirse follows, playing an instrument made from a seashell. The soon meet a group of fairies and it becomes clear that the tales their mother told him were true. This includes the story of Macha the Owl-witch who takes the feelings of magical beings and turns them to stone; if they are to be freed Saoirse must be reunited with the coat so she can sing the Selkie song. It won't be easy as Macha is aware of her.I found this film to be an utter delight, like Cartoon Saloon's previous offering 'The Secret of Kells' it features Irish mythology in a beautiful manner. The story is beautifully animated with charming characters and stunning backgrounds. The settings vary from the city to the countryside to a sea with waves reminiscent of those created by Japanese artist Hokusai. There is a sense of threat but nothing that should be too scary for younger viewers. Even Mocha, the antagonist of the film isn't actually malicious. The music that accompanies the story is charming and works well. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of animation; it was something special; by the end I was both smiling and crying thanks to a bitter-sweet ending."
32,Song of the Sea,8,16 October 2017,Normal Animation Style Done Very Well,"(Flash Review)This is a touching little story mixed in among some vaguely explained Celtic mythology. While the mythology and symbolism is vague, it did let me ponder the visuals and try to figure out some things. Helped to read IMDb reviews after watching. Aside from that, the tale kicks off with a pregnant mother who suspiciously leaves her husband and child. Later, the grandmother gets involved with the family. The meat of the story is hard to explain but the child goes on an adventure trying find the whereabouts of his mother and comes across other mythical experiences along the way, one being some special sweater, shawl, coat or something. The viewer is awash in beautiful and dreamy scenery with a pleasant film score accompaniment. Some of the vagueness is tied up in the end but the vagueness weakened my emotional connection a notch. Overall, it was a fun and unique film for those looking something that won't end up on kids backpacks, pajamas and stickers."
33,Song of the Sea,10,10 August 2017,Most Beautiful Animated Film Ever,"What can I say, gorgeous, heart felt and magical story telling at it's best. The voice acting is brilliant, the sensitivity to character and Celtic tradition and myth are beautifully balanced. I watched it as an adult and was enchanted, but it's affect on kids is amazing. If you need a children's gift a copy of this film is perfect."
34,Song of the Sea,7,25 June 2017,Sweet modern-day fairy tale,"Ben and his younger sister Saoirse live with their father Conor in an isolated lighthouse. Their mother died six years ago while giving birth to Saoirse. Unable to talk, Saoirse is starting to show special powers and sea creatures seem to respect her, indicating that she is no normal little girl.A sweet modern-day fairy tale. A linear adventure story that manages to stay reasonably focused and doesn't get too fantastical while introducing us to some intriguing characters. Mostly ideal for kids though adults won't mind it either. Quite difficult to dislike.Not very profound though - it is just a linear fantasy story, after all. So not brilliant, but still enjoyable."
35,Song of the Sea,8,11 May 2017,When a movie touch your heart....,"Song of the Sea is an animated fantasy drama about a brother and a sister. It is a beautiful painting of an adventure that takes two siblings on an amazing journey. In between, they will try to save lives, find a way home and most crucial, look for unanswered questions. You may not find the description as unique as the movie actually is. The reason is, this movie is not just about the adventure, it's about what they find while they are on it. It is not some treasure I speak of, it is the feeling of love towards one another, a sense of caring. Also, it is about hope, which pushes you beyond your limit to make you brave enough to face your worst fears.The animation is over the top. It feels like we are looking at mere sketches but the characters feel real as you and me. So, when they will cry, you'll get emotional too. It is the powerful scenes like these because of which this movie is amazing. The song which the movie is all about is a melody to your ears and is nicely placed in the movie.I would say that those of you who watched and liked movies like ""A Monster Calls"" and ""Kubo and the two strings"", you will like this one too. All in all, it is an interesting watch for everyone."
36,Song of the Sea,9,13 January 2017,Stunning and wonderful 2D animated movie,"This is a wonderful movie with wonderful artwork that really brought back my childhood. You know those vibrant and colorful story books with pictures that your elementary school teachers use to read to the students. Well it's kind of like that except it's like watching a moving children's story book that even adults can enjoy and be mesmerized with. It's rare to see amazing 2D animation movies that isn't from japan, so this movie was a treat to sit through. This is a stunning and hand-drawn animated folk-lore journey. That encompasses the importance of understanding, bonding and how good intentions might not always be the right choice. This is a wonderful 2D animated movie I would recommend to kids and adults.9/10"
37,Song of the Sea,,4 December 2016,The Sea Inside,"A young Irish lad finds out that his younger sister is a mythical half-human creature called a 'selkie' - a discovery that eventuates in adventures for them both in this pleasant animated feature film. The mythologies surrounding selkies are a little on the complex side, however, the film stands up well as a tale of a boy coming to understand and truly appreciate his sister for all her special and unique qualities, even if some of the finer points of the narrative are hard to nut out. His sister is simply adorable and as she hardly utters a word throughout, this is something that is best attributed to the animation itself and the way the character is written: how much she dotes on her brother despite her affections not being returned, etc. Though a drama first and foremost, the film has several effective comical moments. Not all of the humour works, but there is a lot of amusement to be had in the seal-like creatures trying to track the sister down while donning random disguises and hiding in garbage bins. The music is also as good as one would expect for a film with 'Song' in its title."
38,Song of the Sea,8,27 September 2016,More than a kids movie,"Animation is a tricky thing (no pun intended). On the one hand it's considered a kids domain, though recently many films have proved that their storytelling is at least as good as any ""real"" feature film out there. Then there is a the issue with the animation style in general. This right here, will not please everyone's eye or style/liking they may have. But it's substance rather than anything else that matters here. And it's how you should look at it.Having that out of the way, the movie tells a story that I reckon almost everybody can get behind with. While it should therefor appeal to parents or adults in general too, it's the kid in this that takes the journey, discovering and growing (up) along the ride. There was a reason this was nominated for an Oscar ... Sometimes the Oscars do get it right"
39,Song of the Sea,7,18 January 2015,Cultural identity and postcolonial nostalgia in a stunning animated dream.,"Tomm Moore's second feature has a lot in common with his 2009 debut ""The Secret of Kells"": both are hand-drawn, both are rooted in Celtic mythologies and Irish folklore tradition, both are (at least) nominated for an Oscar.The animation is unbelievably beautiful. The rediscovery of Celtic mythologies is certainly a smart gesture of identity. But the way in which these indigenous stories are woven into a modern story of family value is purely boring and the image of women is absolutely appalling. The moral of the story is mediocre at the best, but for a good reason: to write a subversive version, the original story has to be very well known among the public. So I guess the great innovation of this movie (and of ""The Secret of Kells"") lies in its unapologetic embrace of the local cultural heritage and the audacious move to bring it on the world stage via cinema, arguably the most international and most accessible art.The adult-child dichotomy is utilized to sew together the universes of artistic creation and storytelling. It serves as the metaphor for a few other dualities such as reason-emotion, reality-imagination, and most importantly the modern industrial and colonial world versus the indigenous Irish/Scottish culture marked by lovely folklores yet unknown to the world. The characters' refusal of urban life and attachment to the sea and the family forms a certain type of postcolonial nostalgia that permeates the movie."
40,Song of the Sea,10,31 March 2015,Absolutely beautiful film showing just what traditional animation can do,"This film was nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Feature, losing to Big Hero Six. There will be spoilers ahead:This film was done by Cartoon Saloon, which also released The Secret of Kells. I personally think this film is even better than Kells, which was excellent. The animation in both is beautiful, the story in this one is just a touch more intriguing and the soundtrack is wonderful here.The story revolves around Ben and Saoirse, a brother and sister. They lost their mother around the time of Saoirse's birth. Ben is somewhat resentful of his sister for various reasons, one of which is the fact that, at six, she still doesn't speak.Early on, it becomes obvious that Saoirse is different. It turns out that she's a selkie-a human who is also a seal when she wears her ""skin"", a white fur coat. The children's grandmother finds Saoirse on the shore and decides that the children should live in the city with her rather than at the lighthouse with their father.Saoirse has a musical talent connected to s shell their mother gave to Ben and draws faeries to her when she plays. Other fantastic folk find her and take her to their hiding place to try to convince her to save the faerie folk from the Owl Witch, who is stealing their emotions and turning them into stone. An attempt by owls to grab Saoirse is foiled when Ben jumps in to try to save his sister and their relationship changes for the better.They must return home for Saoirse's coat and have some adventures singly and together before they come home to find that their father has thrown the coat in its chest into the sea. Ben takes it on himself to try to get the coat to save his sister, who will die if she doesn't have the coat Ben gets the coat back with help from an unlikely source, Saoirse sings in order to save the faeries and other mystical folk from disappearing and also save herself. The ending is wonderful and I won't spoil it here.Virtually everything about this film is marvelous and I personally think this was the second best nominee for Animated Feature, behind The Tale of Princess Kaguya. I liked this more than I did Big Hero Six, which I considered very good as well. The music in Song of the Sea is particularly fine. It's just an excellent production.This film is available on Blu Ray and DVD. If you have the capability, go for the Blu Ray, which looks gorgeous. Most highly recommended."
41,Song of the Sea,10,22 March 2015,One of the top-ten animated films ever created,"I watched this film with my grandparents, not knowing what to expect. I'm a huge fan of Celtic and Gaelic culture, and this movie appealed to me. I didn't know what to make of it until I watched it, so I kept my mind open. The next day after watching it I went to the store and bought it.First off, it's one of the few hand-drawn groundbreaking animated films since ""Princess and the Frog"" back in 2009. Being recognized by the Academy with 7 Annie Award nominations and a nomination for Best Animated Feature by the Oscars, beating out 'The LEGO Movie' and 'The Book of Life' for the last spot in a thin five-nominee category.The story is amazing, the colors are beautiful, and the original spiritual feel of true, ancient lore and legend give this movie the tangibility of a 3D high-tech animated feature. Saiorse, the last member of her kind known as a Selkie, a mythical creature of Irish lore that is said to be able to transform into a seal and back to human and vice versa, attempts to try and save the rest of her kind, without saying so much as a word until the final 15 minutes! The contrasting attitude of big brother Ben, who blames Saiorse for everything, including the death of their mother, and now emotionless Dad, who is still tormented from his wife's death all complement and contrast each other perfectly. Put them together with the playful sheep dog Cù and a wide variety of fairy creatures of many shapes, sizes and attitudes, and you get a unique film pulled straight out of the Irish sea.A film that broke ground, developing an absolute perfect blend between ancient lore, modern day, classic animation, friendship, sibling rivalry, fairies, and the true power of family and magic. In my opinion, it could possibly be the highest rated animated film since 'The Lion King.'I definitely give this film a 10/10. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this film. One of the greatest representations of Irish folklore I have ever seen."
42,Song of the Sea,6,20 March 2015,A semi abstract animation to depict a story based on a legend,"The story, based on a local legend is not really a true to the original tale. Instead the movie adapts the legend into a more contemporary time frame and adds it. But still the movie retains the legend's aspect of being magical and mysterious by animating the whole movie in a a somewhat peculiar way. Most of the time the animation presents a pretty landscape background only to stand before more simply drawn character foregrounds. It looks like the reverse of what the classic Disney cartoon movies did with the more detail foreground characters amid the not so concerned background. This movie also presents a peculiar way of perspective drawing, using the style of what most people see on kindergarten children drawings. This adds the flavor that to the movie and appeal to that kind of target audience. For me it's really quite a bum since the movie doesn't really have a wider distribution"
43,Song of the Sea,10,26 May 2015,Perfection of the highest level.,"I apologize for my lack of grammar but I just finished experiencing this movie and have to spill out my thoughts before they evaporate into the large sea of my vast movie ""knowledge"". Being a movie critique for a job is tough having to watch movies and give them a accurate analysis is really dragging, and you can't be kind to movies, because of the impact they have on those can be ecstatic. So when I do a analysis of movies I start with what I understand and work into what I don't. First starting the movie at a rating of 5 and move it up and down on that scale until the movie is over. After I use a tape recorded to ""rant"" essentially what was good and bad about the film or movie and then I write a long detailed analysis on what I experienced when enveloped into the movie or film. Doing this again and again eventually makes all movies seem different but receive the around same overall rating (using a scale of 1-9) and most movies fall under the 1-6 category. I am the ""Anton Ego"" of movies I do enjoy to picking things apart to find the flaws, and from what my boss tells me I do it well. I rate most movies around the poor/average zone, especially newer movies that all use the same system when being produced.Now anime movies fall under a much different category when I review them. Especially movies from the Ghibli realm. Anime movies seem to fall on the higher side of my scale (around 7-8). Now on my scale a ""10"" essentially can't exist the movie would have to provide a perfect grade in all category's which is essentially impossible. I actually never gave a movie a full 9, until I saw Song of the Sea. This movie encapsulates pure beauty on a level that I have not seen before, and I have seen many levels. I rate this movie so highly because the movie quality is of the highest I have ever seen. The animation is like a ivory white canvas waiting to be painted on by god. The music is absolutely beautiful on a level that I have not yet heard, you can see every slow little detail took time, the story, animation and theme blends together in a smoothly colorful pallet that is used to completely influence your soul to enjoy the crazy story and characters. This movie redefines animation. This movie is an adventure, but it's more then that, this movie it's own genera, but it's more than that this movie is a opera of colors and sounds all blended together to create it's story and characters with utmost creativity and imagination. This movie is infinity in animation. I have trouble picking my ""favorite"" movie of all time, and this question comes up to often. Now I have a definite answer. Song of the Sea is perfection, as far as the stars can go this movie ""for me"" will always be beyond them."
44,Song of the Sea,9,30 March 2015,Absolutely stunning,"I have been after this movie ever since I saw its trailer and when I finally found it, I was super-duper excited to see it. From the trailer, you can see that the illustrators use an imaginative (for this age) drawing style that leaves an impression. Personally, I do tend to prefer 2D animation to 3D, simply because I grew up with it, but in this movie, the 2D animation is part of what makes it so unique.I saw this on a late Friday night (at around 1AM) and watched it in my bed  I did the whole silent chocking/crying, trying to not wake up my roommate and make a fool out of myself. But it was just so beautiful that I couldn't contain myself. If you asked me to describe this movie, I would use the words cute, adorable, sweet, beautiful and stunning. And when I say sweet, I really do mean it  I thought the story was utterly touching and made me smile all throughout. In a bundle, it's the adventures of a brother and a sister but it is also so much more.I have never really explored Irish folklore before but this movie left a great impression on me  it was delicately told and not forced upon me, with little chunks being revealed over the course of the film. And the music! It fit perfectly.I just think this was one of the most wonderful and relaxing movies I have seen in a while. I've already recommended it to a lot of friends and family and I urge you to see it. I certainly can't wait to watch it again!Final word: Stunning. Date watched: 2015.03.20 Rating: 9 | 10"
45,Song of the Sea,5,22 March 2015,Massively Overrated TV-quality Cartoon,"4.9 of 10. Whether this is intended as a pat on the head for, like Secret of Kells, a good try from Ireland or if the people in charge of nominating animated films for the Oscars simply have horrible taste and a narrow-minded focus on the technical aspects of animation, they need to be replaced.I found 1 thing technically impressive about this film: the realism of weight/force and motion. Beyond that, it has style, but hardly unique or so above and beyond everything else that it deserves an award for that alone.The story is interesting insofar as its from Ireland and not a conventional, well-known fairytale. Unfortunately, it's also not much of a story or fairy tale. Very straight forward, unoriginal family issues surrounded by more interesting creatures of magic, but again not compelling or extraordinary.As a whole, the typical TV cartoon I'd expect to see during holiday season, in this case St. Patrick's Day.Looking for unnominated Oscar-quality cartoons from last year? Try Mr. Peabody & Sherman, Nut Job, or Penguins of Madagascar. It wasn't a huge year for cartoons outside of the top few films, which at least the Academy picked as if they had a clue at the very top."
46,Song of the Sea,6,28 March 2015,Unusual and interesting graphics but the story left me a bit cold.,"""Song of the Sea"" is a film that might not have gotten much notice had it not been nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. While I liked the unusual graphics quite a bit, the Celtic-inspired plot left me a bit cold.The story is about two kids, Ben and his little sister Saoirse (pronounced 'Seer-See'). Their mother is a selky (also spelled selkie) and that is a person who is part magical seal (sort of like a furry but not so icky). It seems that their father boinked a selky (ewwwwww!!!) and now Saoirse is starting to exhibit selky-like behaviors. But Dad isn't thrilled about this and sends the kids to live with their boring grandmother in the city. Sounds confusing and weird? Well, there is MUCH more about this that gets weirder--making the film a bit like ""Spirited Away"" but with very different graphics. An interesting looking film but one that probably will leave many viewers (especially kids) a bit confused and bored."
47,Song of the Sea,10,29 March 2015,Absolutely Stunning!,"It's my first review on IMDb. I just can't not to share me impressions about this beautiful, extremely emotional animated movie. It's another masterpiece by Tomm Moore, whose ""The Secret Of Kells"" also is one of my favorite movie. Well, ""Song of Sea"" has everything to be a great masterpiece of art - incredible design and animations, beautiful soundtracks, interesting storyline. From even first scenes of the film I knew, that it would be something different between contemporary empty and aggressive animated movies. This movie has a great power to drag you in the world of magic and beauty. That's all. Sorry for my English, I'm not native English speaker, Just enjoy the film!"
48,Song of the Sea,8,26 March 2015,fresh lovely charming,"Ben picks on his sister Saoirse all the time. She's 6 and still hasn't spoken a word. Their father Conor continues to mourn their lost mother. They live in a lighthouse. Using her mother's conch shell, Saoirse discovers another world of magic. She's a selkie who can transform into a seal. Conor discards the mother's trunk and sends the kids away to the city at their grandmother's without him or their dog Cu. Ben runs away to get back his dog. Saoirse joins him on their trek back to the lighthouse as they encounter faeries and discover that their mother's bedtime stories are actually true. However without her coat, Saoirse has no voice as she fades away.It's a magical Celtic tale filled with heart-warming charm. The animation is in the style of a hand drawn children's book. That just adds to the charm. The story is more than a fantasy. It's the sibling family love. There are elements that are new and feel fresh. It has a light loving touch."
49,Song of the Sea,10,22 March 2015,Mystical and enchanting,"I had the pleasure of seeing Song of the Sea at a film festival the other day, and was thoroughly mystified. It had this absolutely gorgeous, idiosyncratic animation style that was like a breath of fresh air from a world awash in either American 3D animation or traditional Japanese anime. In fact, personally, I'm reminded of Wes Anderson: the stylized visuals, quirky characters, and a lot of symmetry. This ultimately helps immerse one into this contemporary, yet out-of-this-world universe that's created here. However, the movie also succeeds on its story and atmosphere.In this movie, Ben lives with his parents happily in a lighthouse on an island. When his mother (a selkie - she can turn into a seal) disappears giving birth to his little sister (also a selkie), the family falls apart: Ben becomes a lousy brother, their father gets lost and consumed with grief, and the fussy grandmother keeps trying to move the kids to the city. After she succeeds, Ben and Saoirse run away and are quickly pulled into a Spirited Away-esque fantasy world wrought with conflict, where its up to them to save the spirit world.While Spirited Away was influenced by traditional Japanese folklore, Song of the Sea does the same with Irish and Celtic folklore instead. Like Hayao Miyazaki's animated masterpiece, this is a breathtaking, yet evenly paced and mesmerizing journey of pure fantasy. While not as bombastic, Song of the Sea delivers in its own way: it slowly weans us into the mystical world, as if in a wild dream, and delivers a sublime, more structured story. Personally, I think the story is a work of art, despite what others have said, especially in the way it parallelizes a contemporary family drama with the Irish folklore- inspired fantasy adventure.In fact, it is merely influenced by the works of Miyazaki; Song of the Sea as a movie is strong enough to stand on its own merits. The influences from Miyazaki and Anderson may be noticeable, but Song of the Sea is still unlike anything I've seen from either of those two, or from cinema in general. After seeing it, I was left truly impressed, having just witnessed such a quiet, yet profound, beauty. Song of the Sea is simply wonderful, and an animated work of art. 10/10."
50,Song of the Sea,9,14 February 2016,Artistic beauty,"It's kind of basic story about overcoming sorrow, but that's not necessarily a minus for an animation movie. It gives a fresh approach to the Celtic folklore, or at least it's not something I've seen before.I think it's just a good metaphor and the movie doesn't directly lead you this way, but it can also work on another level, if you imagine that everything happens only in the mind of the main character.What makes the movie outstanding, however, is the artistic quality of the animation and music. It's very beautifully and uniquely drawn and the music fits the picture perfectly. The pace is kind of slow at places, but it still works very well, as you have more time to enjoy the animation.I would have probably given it 8/10, but at the end I found myself quite emotionally attached to the main characters, so here comes the extra point!- 9/10"
51,Song of the Sea,6,12 January 2016,Moore does it again,"After 2009's surprise Oscar nominee, ""The Secret of Kells"", Irish writer and director Tomm Moore has managed another huge success. Not only did ""Song of the Sea"" score many awards nominations and wins all over the world, but it also was very successful with the Annies and managed an Academy Award nomination in a category won by ""Big Hero 6"" last year. So Tomm Moore turned Ireland almost single-handedly into one of the greatest countries for animated films these days, alongside Japan, France, the United States of course. If you have seen ""The Secret of Kells"", you will see a couple parallels between those two films. Not only the tone and atmosphere is very similar in these 2 fantastic films, in the truest sense of the word, but the technical animation styles resemble each other as well.And child characters are in the center as usual these days. There is a certain feeling of loss, which is also nothing too new to animated films anymore. However, almost everything else does not feel like it has a lot in common with the likes of Pixar and other American animated films in the 21st century. Because of the supernatural parts, it reminded me more of Miyazaki's fantastic worlds in terms of fairy creatures, talking owls, girls transforming into seals etc. I sure could would have liked to see more of these seals, they were a great addition, probably the cutest part of the film. Voice acting comes from Fionnula Flanagan, Brendan Gleeson and a couple actors that I am not too familiar with. They all do a good job.As a whole, I enjoyed the watch. There were segments, during which I could have done with slightly more realism, but overall it was very fine and I applaud Moore for coming up with another success. The animation is really breathtaking at times, especially at the end when we hear the song of the sea referenced in the title. A beautiful sequence, probably one of the best scenes of 2014 in film. The music is very strong from start to finish and there is a strong deal of emotion in here. And if you or your kids do not really manage to appreciate the story or the kids, at least there is still a very big, very furry dog that is great fun to watch in all his scenes. But I would be surprised if you do not like the other aspects of this quality film. I certainly recommend the watch. Thumbs up. Maybe check out Kells first, then if you like it, you will most certainly have a really good time watching this one here as well."
52,Song of the Sea,10,4 January 2016,The magic is real,"I'am probably the most spoiled member of the public, when it comes to animated movies. Dreamworks and Pixar, well they just buy me with their style of animation, so any other is unacceptable for me, well let me just say how stupid is that. No, rely that is the most stupid thing from me for a while. And for a while I skip to watch ""Song of the sea"". This movie convinced me that magic is real. Why? Well it make me fell as a child for a hour and some, as long is the movie. It make me to remember all that stories, innocent stories which my grandfather told me before sleep. Thank you for that. I get used to all that action in animated movie, that I forgot that innocent magic piece of a story. ""Song of the sea"" brings all that to the screen. All the magic, all the story telling beauty, with appropriate animation. Why is this appropriate animation, well if you are born in late '90, you would probably not understand that, but it is time to got it, and the best way for you to got it, is to start watching this movie. It is like all those illustration in Grimm brothers books, and it is so much beautiful that is the shame for me that I didn't look this movie earlier. But I did watched now. And how Japanese say, the best time is now. Maybe this movie is special and for bringing that beautiful idea of early Disney, it is all about making some magic for the audience, it is about making audience to fell special for watching that, I think that that is the some definition of art, and pure art this movie is."
53,Song of the Sea,10,1 November 2015,A Film that Puts Majority of Animated Films to Shame,"I have seen The Secret of Kells and loved it. I had never seen such kind of animation before at that time. When I heard that the same director was going to make another animated film based on a folklore, I was eager to watch it. I can say that it was worth the wait. This film is made with a budget of $5-$10 million and still puts $150+ millions films to shame. The visuals are spectacular. I would have given it a 10 just for the visuals. However what makes it excellent is not just the visuals but everything about this film is great. Be it music, voice acting ,pace and storytelling. Moore tells the story in a beautiful way which are reminiscent of Miyazaki films. Miyazaki got the ideas from Japanese folklore and tales and put them on screen. Moore did the same thing with The Song of the Sea. It is a brilliantly made fantasy film. I will be looking forward to other films by Moore."
54,Song of the Sea,9,7 August 2015,Even my 2 year old was mesmerised,"Watching this movie you get a feeling that you are about to watch something special. I applaud any movies that tell long gone stories. Even my 2 year old went silent before managing a 'wow'. It doesn't disappoint.It's a beautifully illustrated story about Irish/Gaellic folklore.The fact that the Irish language is becoming increasingly rare makes this movie not just enjoyable but a record for the future. It's not easy to get a feeling that this about an animated movie. I hope it does well, it truly deserves to.I'll be buying the DVD once it comes out, that's saying something.Well done to all involved!"
55,Song of the Sea,10,22 May 2015,An Original and Emotional Adventure with Beautiful Animation and Stunning Voice work. Why didn't THIS win the Oscar?!,"As you may have known, I enjoyed The Secret of Kells very much but Tom Moore's follow up film is just AMAZING. I just sat after watching it, moved to tears by the music, emotion, style and art work of it all. Ben, an 11 year old boy discovers that his 6 year old sister is actually a Selkie (seal woman), just like his mother Bronach who told him stories of selkies and their responsibility to sing in order to free the faeries across the sea. It is implied however in the opening that Bronach died or ran away after giving birth to his sister who Ben grows up resenting because of it, frequently bullying her or saying mean things. Saoirse the little girl is mysteriously drawn to the ocean and the seals are drawn to her. She finds her selkie skin which was hidden by their father Connor, in fear he would lose his daughter to the sea as well. She enters the ocean where we see her transform into a white seal pup and play. However, Ben and Saoirse's Granny is convinced that living on an island away from the rest of the mainland is unhealthy for them and so decides to bring them to the city to stay with her, but Saoirse's will to return to the island grows stronger as she plays her mother's song on an ancient seashell. Before long, Ben is swept up in a journey with Saoirse involving faeries, an owl witch, spirits and selkie magic.Wow. Words cannot even describe how beautiful this movie is. Every moment hit all the right emotional parts, making the characters seem real and genuine. We feel what they feel and the simplicity of the style and design allow for perfect facial expressions. The strange and mysterious lights that lead Saoirse to the water are reminiscent of the Willo the Wisps in Pixar's Brave, the myth of Selkies IS Celtic, (Irish and Scottish.) I am Scottish so this film really hit home for me. The spirituality in this film is subtle yet it stands out, if that makes sense. There are symbols of Catholicism such as the Virgin Mary, however this is unsurprising as it is one of Ireland's main religions. Then there are the Denashee, the faeries who wish to be free and enter the other realm by Saoirse and her selkie song. The story is very original. I don't really think we've seen many animated movies depicting the myth of the selkie, instead of traditional mermaids and sirens. The way it constantly takes these twists and turns of danger and of joy has you on the edge of your seat. The characters are also wonderful. Tom Moore writes child characters exceptionally well. Ben is a young boy who is imaginative, likes drawing, and playing with Cú his sheepdog, however he is far from a goody-two shoes. He can be mean, bossy, temperamental and likes to tease his younger sister.However he does realize his mistakes after a vision shows him the truth about his mother and realizes he hasn't fulfilled his promise to her of being ""the best big brother in the world."" Saoirse is small, and very cute. She doesn't say a word until the end as it is established she has been undergoing speech therapy and this makes the selkie background even more of worth because she can't even talk, let alone sing. All of her thoughts are told to us through her expressions. The Granny character is very good too. Unlike in Kells, there is no real villain. She is just doing what she thinks is best for her grandchildren. Connor her son, goes to the pub on the mainland every October 30th on Saoirse's birthday to drown his sorrows. Brendan Gleeson again reprises a role in one of Moore's films as well as Lisa Hannigan singing the theme song Amhran na Farraige. Hannigan's voice is soothing and melodic, in Gaelic and English; the Gaelic one is my favourite version! The whole film is full of beautiful images and heavy emotional themes,such as the importance of family love and even the theme of moving on from loss of a loved one. Macha who is built up to be the bad one, but she's just trying yo help by bottling up the feelings of people, literally. Just like Macha turned her son Mac Lir to stone, Granny has metaphorically turned Connor to stone. The film's climax is the most prettiest and elegant animation;from the golden lights resembling the aurora Borealis to the spirits of the liberated faeries! Lucy O'Connell's singing is lovely! All the voice actors do an outstanding job of conveying the emotions of the scenes across. Ben's voice actor is brilliant so funny!""Jesus Mary and Joseph!"" ""Oh that's good. Let's follow the magical lights. That's much safer than being on a BUS!"" Brendan Gleeson brings a caring yet weary voice to the father and the scene where he yells at his son as he tries to buckle him into Granny's car is heart-wrenching. The scene where Bronach and Connor kiss isn't at all a typical romantic one. It is one of true love, and a caring bittersweet notion that says, ""although we will never see each other again, I love you."" I would rate this a PG and recommend it to anyone from 7 to 89 years old, but if you are sensitive when it comes to emotional scenes that can tear you apart as easily as Toy Story 3, or Finding Nemo,did you may want to be warned on quite a few scenes. I myself laughed, cried and just smiled. It's another one of Moore's films that really does get it's inspiration from Hayao Miyazaki's works of Studio Ghibli such as Spirited Away,and Princess Mononoke. I loved this film. Go and experience it for yourself."
56,Song of the Sea,10,20 May 2015,Best Western animated film (and Disney antidote) for 30+ years,"If you're a fan of Japanese animated films, and in particular the work of Hayao Miyazaki (a fair share of which feature in the IMDb top 250), then you might wonder why nothing similar has come out of the US and Europe for such a long time, and you may have come to the same one-letter-response that I did: Disney. That company may not have complete control over every animation company in the Western world or every technology, but they certainly exert control over animated content. Which means that not only Disney features tend to move along certain gender stereotypes. And that may have made you feel just as queasy over the years as it did me, for there's a weirdly adult dynamic in most Disney films.Maybe this is the secret of 'Song of the Sea' and the enthusiastic response it's been receiving. For this is truly a film for children, a fairytale, a story about family bonds, a story based on the degrading, yet all-important link between man and nature. Like Miyazaki's films, it touches upon something in children and adults alike, a yearning to belong, to dream, and to wonder. Most importantly, it doesn't try to sell you something. It doesn't want to make you look or dress or sing in a certain way. It doesn't place any sexual divide between girls and boys, its characters are who they are. And it respects its viewers as people, not as marketing targets.Perhaps the critical success of this piece will inspire some sort of a renaissance of the almost lost art of animated film in the West. Perhaps younger viewers will take a look at similar classics of the past, like 'The King and the Mockingbird' (1980) or the Soviet 'Snow Queen' (1957) or the far better early Disney films themselves, first and foremost 'Alice in Wonderland' (1951). Or perhaps this will remain a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and the Disney machine will continue to suffocate our dreams. In any case, don't miss this."
57,Song of the Sea,9,9 May 2015,Wonderful movie and appealing to all ages,"This film is a perfectly woven story that kids and adults alike can appreciate. The backgrounds are painted beautifully. The sound effects are done very well. The voices perfectly fit their characters. The only real complaint I have is that I'm not too fond of the character design and the animation style at times. I had hoped that the characters weren't as flat looking as depicted on the cover. Overall, a movie well worth a watch and proof that quality animated family films are not limited to Disney and Studio Ghibli. The story is captivating. The Irish culture shines through the likable and relatable characters. The film opens your mind to another culture."
58,Song of the Sea,9,6 May 2015,a beautiful non American style,"a truly heart warming fairy tale - with real fairies. a story about family, siblings love, sadness of ones who have lost somebody, hidden fairies, ans of course of an adventure.If you like stories about mythology put in cartoons, you will love this. What I really loved was a simple and pleasant animation(reminds me of old child fairy tales), and that there was no American feeling in the story(great for a change). if you can, watch it in original sound, the translation of songs can turn out to be not so fine.Recommend for children of all age (if you feel like one even if you are 50)"
59,Song of the Sea,9,27 April 2015,"Captivating, lyrical, magical -- a real treat","Children's movies aren't something I gravitate to now that I'm an adult, but I still am on the lookout for interesting animated films that have intelligence and maturity. Sadly, the US is sorely lacking in that department, with Disney having (seemingly) lost its way. Thankfully, I am able to find what I'm looking for with animated offerings from other countries, and SONG OF THE SEA is just the latest of these discoveries (for me). SONG OF THE SEA is loosely adapted from an Irish/Scottish legend about women (mostly) who can exist in seal form. That was something I had to look up to more fully understand this rich mythology, which might be a sizable learning curve for someone who isn't from Ireland or Scotland, but the story told in this film should be understandable and relatable on an emotional and intellectual level by anyone who chooses to watch it. I really don't want to give away any of the story at all because doing so would spoil the experience of seeing it for the first time. The film generally deals with family, loss and magic, which should be enough going in. The magical elements will appeal to children, as will the young protagonists, while the adults will be able enjoy the allegorical and symbolic layers that gradually unveil themselves as the film progresses. Aside from a few narrative conveniences, I thought that this film was exceptionally crafted and emotionally involving. I should also mention the animation style, which had a watercolor-like/storybook feel to it and gently moved between soft, impressionistic images and more angular, expressionistic ones. If I had to make a comparison, the character design reminded me a little bit of PERSEPOLIS, but this film is in full color and uses it to beautiful effect. Ultimately, I hardly found any fault at all here and this Oscar-nominated film deserves to seen more than it has. A definite ""see it."""
60,Song of the Sea,,23 April 2015,"An Adorable, Enriching & Beautifully Animated Fairy Tale!","Nominated for Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, Song of the Sea is an irresistibly adorable, delightfully charming & undeniably magical cinema from the Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon that's affectionately crafted, blissfully told & beautifully animated from start to finish and resonates an incredible amount of warmth, tenderness & love throughout its runtime.Based on an ancient Celtic myth, Song of the Sea tells the story of Saoirse; a 6-year old girl living in a lighthouse with her father & brother and is the last of the selkies; a mythological being who lives as a human on land & as a seal underwater. The plot covers her adventure as she escapes from her grandmother's home with her brother & travels to free the magical beings trapped in the human world.Directed by Tomm Moore, Song of the Sea casts its spell from its opening moments for the entire story evokes a childlike sense of wonder & amazement, thanks to its highly innocent ambiance, splendid camera-work, firm editing & intimate score. The traditional animation in itself is awe-inspiring plus the use of colours is so splendid that it provides an extremely rich texture n feel to the whole narrative.On an overall scale, Song of the Sea is a polished work of art & animation that has its tale deeply rooted in the world of fairy tales. Sweet, heartwarming, poignant, virtuous & immensely cute, it may look like a film that's brought alive from the artwork of a children's fantasy novel yet packs in enough strength in the storytelling department to dazzle the grown-ups in a very unexpected manner. Definitely worth a shot."
61,Song of the Sea,10,19 April 2015,A sheer delight.,"I have almost always ignored the 2-D movies.Its not totally my fault though because most of these don't get much hype and often pass unnoticed. I found this one while going through IMDb's most popular list for 2014. And I am glad that I found it. This movie changed my entire perspective of animated movies. It is an Irish folklore but it is so nicely told and animated that it seems you have entered a whole new world. However good they may get with technology, 3-D glasses, Oculus Rift, Holo lens and what not but its movies like these that actually make you feel that you are inside their world. Okay its still not my favorite movie but it is so engrossing that while watching it I really didn't notice what else is going on around me. This whole thing may seem like an exaggeration to some, but I have just finished watching this movie and right now I am so hyped."
62,Song of the Sea,8,19 April 2015,Traditional animation again proves it is an irreplaceable curio!,"Five years after his Oscar-nominated feature debut THE SECRET OF KELLS (2009), which unfortunately I've yet to watch, the Irish filmmaker Tomm Moore's second film SONG OF THE SEA continues to capitalise on the ancient mythology with the traditional hand-drawn animation technique, and again becomes a dark horse on this year's Oscar race of BEST ANIMATION PICTURE. The story takes place in a contemporary Ireland, when the film opens with an arresting myth of a pregnant mother abruptly abandons her son and husband before parturition as there is a sorrowful secret behind, then time jumps to 6 years after, the son Ben, his father Conor and his little sister Saoirse, now six-year-old, but still cannot speak, live in a lighthouse by the sea. The sibling relation is not so harmonious as Ben treats Saoirse as a thorn in his side, and subliminally he still cannot accept their mother's inexplicable disappearance, so is the viewers, what actually happened that night? The narrative sustains a cogent suspense to slowly elucidate the myth, soon we find out Saoirse is not a human girl, she is a Selkie, a mythological creature live as a seal in the sea but on land, it appears as a human form. Moreover, the song sung by a Selkie has a potent magic to rescue all the fairies who has been turned into stone without feelings from a wicked witch Macha, who, in fact, has a tale of woe of her own (with her son the weeping giant Mac Lir) which prompts the scheme of insulation from all the feelings. The inviting myth aside, a core process is how Ben realises to shoulder the responsibility as a big brother, to face his fear (of water) and embrace the sibling love. The journey is a dreamlike fantasy, they meet fairy musicians living in the roundabout, a magic well leads to the Great Seanachai with gazillions of white hair and each contains a piece of memory, etc. The 2D illustration of characters and objects may not be that spectacular, individually they are mostly simple lines and geometric patterns, but altogether they shape a collective power which is awe-inspiring thanks to the elbow grease and creativity from Moore and his assiduous team, they fabricate a visually enthralling fairytale to behold, so consistently exotic and artistically transcendent, even though halfway through, viewers can very much get a hold of the myth and know pretty well what will eventually happen, yet, the emotional resonance can still be profusely effective in its ending, when the mother of Ben and Saoirse returns to settle her inter-species romance. This is the unique allure of SONG OF THE SEA, to single out a tale with its ethereal touch and graphic stratagem, if the same story was told by a live-action, one might reasonably doubt whether the same effect can be duly induced, thus, traditional animation again proves it is an irreplaceable curio and should be enshrined to a more revered niche in today's digital epoch."
63,Song of the Sea,8,11 February 2015,Don't throw out those old coats . . .,". . . seems to be the main message of SONG OF THE SEA. Selkie Saoirse will die if her baby coat from six years earlier cannot be located. Fortunately for Saoirse and the thousands of souls depending upon her, Dad just chucks the family refuse off his deck, rather than having it picked up the American way by garbage trucks land-filling it to who-knows-where. If Saoirse were an American Selkie, her civilization would be doomed. The bottom line is that the longer you've had something, the more important it becomes to keep it even longer. As the TV show STORAGE WARS proves, many Americans already try to take this lesson to heart. But STORAGE WARS also indicates that some folks don't keep their financial priorities straight. In moments of fiscal weakness, they squander their storage unit rental fees on frills such as lottery tickets, utility bills, or food, abandoning the stuff that may become of Life or Death importance any instant. But as Saoirse's SONG OF THE SEA commands, do whatever it takes to take care of the artifacts that someday may take care of you!"
64,Song of the Sea,7,17 May 2015,Enchanting,"With attractive animation and enchanting story, Song of the Sea is one of the most beautiful animation films of recent times. Based on Irish folklore, it manages to pleasantly invest in the mythology of the tale. The story follows two kids living on lighthouse cliff with their father, Ben and his sister Saoirse. Their mother seems to have died at the time of Saoirse's birth. She always used to tell Ben stories about the Selkie (a girl who could turn into s seal) and her song that would free all the mystical creatures from the spell of evil owl witch Macha. Back in present day Ben finds his sister annoying and Saoirse hasn't learnt to talk yet. One night Saoirse wanders into the sea wearing a mysterious white jacket and turns into a seal!!! The scene was truly magical and then is washed out on the shore. Worried about the kids safety their grandmother takes them to the city far away from the sea. They find little joy there, and escape to get back to their home. We encounter a magical adventure on their journey, where Ben finds out his sister is Selkie from his mom's story and rest follows the predictable path.I would like to point out that the story doesn't try to explain its mystics that very well. For most of the film we are left wondering what sense to make out of it all. Still as a magical adventure it works perfectly fine as it doesn't divert from ground theme. The hand- drawn animation is remarkably stunning. You will relish each and every frame of the beautiful landscapes ad designs. The music equally beautiful is the heart of the film. When the selkie finally sings the song of the sea I bet each one of you would touched by the music. The voice-cast is good and directer Tomm Moore has done a fine job giving us a fairy- tale story with good enough depth. if you like animation films based on regional traditions and folklore this is not to be missed!RATING: [3.5/5]"
65,Song of the Sea,8,10 April 2015,Wondrous,"You can't mention ""Song of the Sea"" without its distinct look, which is sort of a cross between a children's book and a cut scene you'd find in a Nintendo game )not the criticism it sounds like). I got a serious Zelda vibe, like The Phantom Hourglass, that cel-shaded stuff. This is a feast for the eyes, and a fine treat for someone who's not all-too-thrilled with the 3D-rendered CGI dominance in animation.But on the whole, this is a beautifully realized story, and far from style over substance. It's a straightforward narrative, but the characters are detailed and nab you from the outset. It also helps that it's an appealing world drawing on Irish folklore. There's something here for all ages, and it's a movie that delivers tremendous emotional satisfaction.8/10"
66,Song of the Sea,8,4 April 2015,What a Special Song,"""Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand."" -- William Butler YeatsSo opens the lovingly animated Song of the Sea, the second feature- length film of Oscar-nominated director Tomm Moore who gave audiences the animated surprise The Secret of Kells in 2009. Both of his films are glorious tributes to the lore and history of his beloved Ireland, and his 2D animation style is grandly and respectfully suited to the tone and mood(s) his films want to convey.In Song of the Sea, a young boy loses his mother as she brings his younger sister into the world. It sounds bleak but it isn't an overly dark moment in the film as Song of the Sea simply needs the daughter to come into the film for the story to actually begin and the build-up is ever so brief with the actual moment not being captured on screen. The boy, Ben, was taught songs of yore from his loving mother ... all which had secrets and links to her (unknown to him) past history as a selkie -- a mythical creature of Irish/Scottish lore that was a woman who could become a sea-dwelling seal.Set in a mostly-modern animated world, the mythical past is believed to be exactly that -- ""mythical"" -- until a few years pass and the (mute) young sister, Saoirse, is called back to the sea after playing a mystical shell flute ... much to the horror of her father (Brendan Gleeson - Gangs of New York), brother and Granny (Fionnula Flanagan - The Others).Granny is so horrified by the thought of losing a grandchild that she sweeps the two kids up removing them from their coastal dwelling to live with her in the big city. It is here that the journey of the two kids begin as they make it their mission to return home to their father and the wide-open ocean their mother so loved. It is also on this journey that the two fully discover the purpose and meaning of Saoirse's abilities ... and that her life depends on making it back to the sea and finding a mythical coat left behind for her by her late-mother.The film is a beautiful one to look at and watch unfold. The cutesy dynamics of siblings plays out nicely as big brother Ben tires easily of a little sister he cannot fully relate to although knows her importance (to himself as well as selkie lore). Elegantly drawn, Song of the Sea carries on the tradition of colorful-yet-simple animation from Moore's prior film. Where that film used greenish tints to capture the Emerald Isle, Song uses various shades of blues and grays to capture to spirit of the sea ... and the sea-life on display here is adorable.I'm not sure if the film fully explains itself, but it has piqued my interest in its subject matter and some of the stories at its center. I just may have to learn more about them ... which means this film is still a success.Beautiful. Simple. Charming. Song of the Sea is another pleasant film experience from a most-promising young filmmaker."
67,Song of the Sea,9,3 April 2015,Brand new from non-Disney and non-Studio Ghibli.,"If you ever watched 'The Secret of Kells', you will never think of skipping it. Though, people watch it in the interest of the Oscar connection. From all the nominees it is the clear winner according to me, even far better than the real winner 'Big Hero 6'. The American Academy Awards had failed to recognise the true ingenuity. That does not stop win the heart the of millions of children around the world. As for the adults, it makes you feel young again for a while. Lots of humour in it with faint emotions at the end along the kids favoured flavour throughout.Far East and far West film industries ruling the animation production, but Tomm Moore from Ireland is trying to open the new gate from the European division. Not many people are aware of him, one more movie and its success may lead to the greater heights for sure. This animation technics are very unique, but not the first time in the use.The character illustrations were cuter to enchant the young kids. Watching the movie is like reading a children's storybook with the large pictures everywhere and a couple of lines of words in the corner of the page. Like the anime in Japan and 3D animation in Hollywood, this would mark the Euro on the map. There are many animations are made and still making in Europe, but this one is the new perspective of hope to reach all the major and remote places of the Earth. Wish it moves in the right direction.If you had known how all the fairy tales work, you would feel you can predict this story because, you know defeating evil, breaking curses, the happy endings are the usual part. So what matters is the storytelling, how well the stories are presented on the screen. This film excels in that point, and the music is the another highlight of the movie. Whoever the music director/composer I must praise him. Almost a year ago I saw the trailer for the first time and I felt like I already loved the movie, mainly because of the music.''Hold this shell to your ear and listen carefully. You will hear the song of the sea.''In his earlier movie the director told a simple and short story extraordinarily, and still I hum that beautiful 'Aisling song' sometime. This movie had a wonderful adventure story of a boy called Ben and his little sister Saoirse. In the journey of running away from an owl witch, the magical creatures and an ancient seashell guide them a path. On the right time the title song makes the way to delight next 10 minutes of the crucial segment in the narration. I love the original version, in Irish even though I don't understand. It was good and catchy, even for the grown ups as well. Feels like, want to visit those places from the movie, but sadly our only option is Disneyland, huh.Disney and Studio Ghibli are the king and queen of fairy tale movies. No one would, but if you are mildly fed up of those, here the new dimensional fresh tales from the Ireland's folklore. Though, it sets in the modern world, but does not abandon to bring the key factors. Like the ancient meet the modern world with the same intensity. Kind of new to hear the words like Selkie, Macha etc., but, brand new for the people who live thousands of kilometers away in the different continents. Animation movie fanatics would love it, but if there are any children like niece and nephew in your home or visits you, watch it with them on that occasion and you would feel differently.9/10"
68,Song of the Sea,8,1 April 2015,This animation is a stunning mix of old school artistry meeting the motion picture.,"First off I was blown away by the beautiful artwork of the film. Each and every scene is masterfully drawn the team behind the art. The concept of showing the scenery with the the imaginary vision of capturing the other wildlife within the shot really did some wonders.Props great concept in Art, and for that I gave it a eight, of-course with a nice nice twist to the folk tale that told here.The story centering on the Celtic legends of the Selkies or the Seal people entwined with the fairies tells the brother sister story and a half Selkies journey of discovery. Born of a Selkie mother and Human father the the little sister inherits her mothers Selkie side, during her birth for some reason which was not very apparent the mother had to leave the family leaving the baby behind. In truth it's a children tale so the story isn't that complicated or intricate."
69,Song of the Sea,8,1 April 2015,Beautiful,"I'm glad i finally saw this movie because i'm so sick of all the 3D animated movies that came out recently which almost never where anything special. This movie, for me, is the exact opposite. The animation is absolutely gorgeous. Not only is it 2D, but everything Looks like it came directly out of a children's book. This creates very stunning visuals and makes it really unique.The story also feels like one from a children's book. It's a very lighthearted, kid friendly tale but there's also good drama in it. And that's why i like it. The movie is obviously for kids but there are a few mature themes that adults can enjoy. I don't want to give away anything because i think that everyone should experience this on their own. If you're tired of all the generic animated movies of recent years, with a few exceptions, than you owe it to yourself to watch this one. This is finally a new animated movie where i think to myself that this would be one of the first movies that i would show to my children."
70,Song of the Sea,9,31 March 2015,A beautiful Celtic animated classic,"Lovely Oscar-nominated Irish animation from director Tomm Moore about a young boy (voiced by Moone Boy's David Rawle) who goes on an adventure in order to save his little sister Saoirse who may have inherited the Selkie gene from her mother who disappeared years earlier. Beautifully made and lovingly animated in a hand-drawn fashion, with superb use of sound and a fantastic score I'm going to pick up when I get a chance, this animation has true heart. Some of the side characters aren't brilliantly expanded upon but no matter when the leads are so captivating and the faerie world has a nice pagan feel to it, strangely like I felt watching the likes of The Wicker Man. Beware the owls and sit back and enjoy. 9/10"
71,Song of the Sea,10,24 March 2015,"Remarkable, all around great animated film!","Films usually don't make a lasting impression on me, let alone an animated film, but this was something different.A film with traditional 2D animation, gorgeous visuals, beautiful sounds and a touching story is so rare these days that it makes Song of the Sea really special.Was very surprised with a huge amount of symbolism and metaphors all throughout.Overall, it's a fantastic film, which should be seen by adults and youngsters.Highly recommend this film!"
72,Song of the Sea,7,15 April 2015,A Song Worth Listening To,"Sometimes, in an animated film, you don't need a celebrity-laden voicecast, tons of pop culture jokes and a blaring soundtrack full of the latest chart hits. A strong story, well-written characters, some traditional instrumental music and lovely, colourful, unconventional animation is all you require. Song Of The Sea may not be from a big studio and isn't as flashy as the hugely budgeted CGI releases... But in terms of charm and imagination, it beats most of them hands down.The plot comes from a traditional Irish legend, concerning a human man who has two children with a sea-dwelling creature, called a 'Silkie'. After the second child (a girl) is born, the Silkie realises she must sacrifice herself in order so that her new daughter must live. Flash forward a few years later, and the infant girl is now a child, resented by her big brother for supposedly making their mother disappear, while their dad is still pining for his lost love. Oh, and for some reason she is a mute.I won't say any more lest I ruin what lies ahead, but sufficed to say... The girl finding out her secret powers, the development between her relationship with her older sibling, and the strange, mystical legend which encompasses itself into all kinds of mind-boggling situations is a joy to behold. Usually, I like a bit of comedy to go with my animated films... But here, it would only detract from the exhilarating journey our protagonists go on (both physically and spiritually) So I'm MORE than happy to let it slide.Basically, a thoroughly satisfactory effort, with a real tearjerker of a denouement. Just try to stop those flecks of water from running down..."
73,Song of the Sea,,23 March 2015,Charming,"Song of the Sea follows Ben and his little sister Saoirse as they try to get a magical object and save magical beings... and why not their family as well?The movie begins with a beautiful animation that sets the tone for the rest of the story. Ben is angry with his little sister. Their father is lost in sadness, and their grandmother feels powerless to help them but still tries to, but not in the best way possible.And you believe in their plight. You want this family to get better. The way their story seamlessly mixes with the folklore is great. You believe wholeheartedly in the magic of their world.Seeing Ben and Saiorse interact is great. They are just two kids and you see them act with innocence and curiosity just like any child. Watching them reminded of the relationship between me and my own sister.And the animation is great. This movie does not go for the realistic approach, and instead goes for a more stylistic choice, but is still beautiful. Some of the scenes have such depth and contrast and color that could par with the work of the best cinematographers out there.Kids and grown ups will like this one. Big brothers should watch it with their little sisters, at least to remind them not to be such jerks at times."
74,Song of the Sea,6,10 September 2016,Song of the Sea,"I may have seen images of this Welsh cartoon at the time of its release, I knew it was likely to be something magical, it being well rated and recognised during awards season meant I had to watch it. Basically lighthouse keeper Conor (Brendan Gleeson) lives on an island with his son Ben (David Rawle), his wife Bronach (Lisa Hannigan) and sheepdog Cú, but things change when Bronach disappears, presumably dying after childbirth, leaving behind daughter Saoirse, and a seashell horn. Six years later, Conor is a broken man, and Ben is antagonistic towards his younger sister, he blames her for their mother leaving, she has not learned to speak, and Granny (Fionnula Flanagan), the grandmother, is visiting for Saoirse's birthday. At night, Saoirse plays the seashell horn, leading her to a white sealskin coat in Conor's closet, she wears the coat and walks towards the sea, there is a group of seals, revealing she is a selkie, a mythological creature who lives as a seal. She is found swimming by Granny, she insists the children are not being cared for properly and should be taken to the city, Ben protests, but Conor reluctantly agrees, and locks the coat in a chest, throwing it into the ocean. Saoirse plays the shell horn again on Halloween night, she and Ben attempt to run home, but the fairies who were alerted want to take Saoirse with them to Tír na nÓg (""Land of the Young""), but the fairies are turned to stone when attacked by the owls of Macha (Fionnula Flanagan), the sea deity. They catch up to Cú who followed them, but Saoirse is becoming ill, she falls into a sacred well, Ben follows and meets the Great Seanachaí (the storyteller/historian) (Jon Kenny), they learns that she was kidnapped by Macha, and she is mute because she needs to coat, or she will die. Ben learns that Bronach was a selkie herself, and remorsefully watched as she returned to the sea, he is given a hair that will lead them to Macha, who claims that her son Mac Lir (Brendan Gleeson) suffered a broken heart. Ben is able to rescue Saoirse and makes Macha realise that stealing feelings does not help, she flies them back home, where Conor finds them and takes Saoirse to hospital, at the same time the grandmother is trying to find them. Ben dives into the ocean to recover the coat, with the help of seals and Conor he finds it, Saoirse is made fully healthy and sings the song of the sea, the fairies rise, and Mac Lir, his dogs and Macha emerge and they head for Tír na nÓg. Bronach appears and prepares to depart with Saoirse, but she is half-human, so she departs instead with the coat, the fairies also say a tearful farewell, Ben and his family finally return home to their island, and Granny arrives, she decides the children can stay with their father, Ben and Soairse reconcile and become friends. Also starring Lucy O'Connell as Saoirse, Pat Shortt as Lug, Colm Ó'Snodaigh as Mossy and Liam Hourican as Spud / Bus Driver. Irish stars Gleeson and Flanagan do their voicing well, the story is based on a famous folklore tale, it was a little confusing at times, but generally it is a sweet tale of a boy learning to become a better brother to his fantastical sister, the animation is beautiful and the music score is haunting, it works well both as a fun adventure and a moving, heartbreaking exploration, a worthwhile animated animated fantasy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Good!"
75,Song of the Sea,5,14 August 2016,One for the kids,"SONG OF THE SEA isn't one of my favourite animations, but it's pretty successful at achieving its aims and as a film is difficult to dislike. It can be compared favourably to the likes of Studio Ghibli's output from across the world, although the basic animation means that it's not quite as good or creative as a Ghibli movie, although it IS colourful. The story is based in Irish folklore, in particular the legend of the selkie, seals that can adopt human form.It's an occasionally twee piece that nonetheless gets by thanks to the theme of loss at its heart. I didn't really warm to the child characters in the movie, but Brendan Gleeson is surprisingly gruff and realistic as the grieving father, and there are some fine characters in the supporting cast. SONG OF THE SEA ably brings to life a magical otherworld and it's the type of film an imaginative child will naturally enjoy."
76,Song of the Sea,10,12 August 2016,"At the pantheon of animation, a perfect 10","The existing reviews say it all. Unfortunately, not the total score, dah!! I cannot say no more, other than i had to subscribe to IMDb, just for this rating. And since IMDb is asking for a few more lines in order to post the review... A modern fairy tale, a bed time story about a child's quest, one of a few of its kind, magical yet real, inspiring, and in times breath taking, and at the climax greatly emotional, i dare you watch this movie, cry your eyes out, and then, just maybe, subscribe to IMDb. Unfortunately (or not) Hollywood animation does not provide such depth, trying to make things complicated, captivating the audience through elaborate CGI action scenes. This movie is a real masterpiece defying the very nature of that western ideal. Took me back to an early age (now 38), when mother used to tell me that story about some pigeon that embarked on a quest to find its stolen babies. Congratulations to the makers. This movie should not have lost the Oscar, especially over Big 6, which was a poor movie after all. But then again, more and more people are turning their backs to the academy. About time."
77,Song of the Sea,10,5 June 2016,Ancient variation of the little mermaid - visually brilliant - genius film making.,"The animation does not have the ""benefit"" of the Hollywood rendering processes and therefore appears a little less sophisticated than the Hollywood blockbusters at first glance. However, the visual impact of the images would be lost if this was done. The real impact of this story is towards the end when the little girl finds her song and the world changes in images that are almost impossible to describe. In many ways this film defies any attempt to categorize it. Both children and seniors and all ages in between can find something to enjoy. I saw it twice a few weeks apart and it was better the second time as I saw new images and events I missed the first time. Highly recommended - a tale to cherish. The ancient myths about the selkie are not generally known worldwide, so it would help if a viewer googled ""selkie"" before watching the film. I did that after watching the movie the first time, and it changed my understanding the second time."
78,Song of the Sea,8,28 March 2016,Absolutely gorgeous presentation that makes you forgive the generic plot.,"A beautifully animated, tranquil experience. This film takes a concept and uses themes that I had no previous interest in and manages to thoroughly engage me and has enticed me to see more of its kind. The presentation of Irish and Scottish folklore is marvellous, alongside its magical score helped along with its selection of Celtic instruments. One personal liking of the film is the use of an Irish voice cast who all do a great job, it is a refreshing change from other animated movies opting for an American or Canadian cast whereas this movie greets me with something more familiar and what I can relate to more, not to mention it all adds to the overall atmosphere. The film is not without its flaws however. When I walked out of theatre evaluating the experience from a sum-total, I soon concluded that the story was generic. Visuals and music aside what you have is another film in which the plot is about returning the chosen one to restore peace to a world we've only just been introduced to... Sound familiar? When watching, this was not a problem as I was completely engaged, but should be a troubling factor when revisiting. If a less noticeable setup was used, this would be a movie I'd watch multiple times, the lore has the potential to be so much more... perhaps a masterpiece. What the film has provoked me to do is plan to watch anime films with a similar structure - creating a fantastic, magical adventure in a world ripe with cultural influence - such as the works of Hayao Miyazaki with his resume that include Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro and Castle in the Sky. Song of The Sea, a lovely tale that will enlighten your heart from start to finish, among the best animated films that have appeared recently, but is not as popular, so do please check it out."
79,Song of the Sea,9,16 February 2016,Refreshingly Different - Beautiful Film,"I personally feel that this is the best animated film of 2015, surpassing even the highly acclaimed Inside Out and Princes Kaguya.The magical story unfolds in a style that is so refreshingly different to the the standard computer animated films that have become far too commonplace. Song of the Sea has been constructed with lovingly drawn, hand detailed animation. The animation style is so simplistically real, yet the animators use their incredible story telling skills to allow you to feel an immediate closeness to it.From the opening we are blessed in hearing the hypnotic ""Song of the Sea"" melody, within seconds it is clear that this film is something special. The song while beautiful, also perfectly complements the tempo of the film.Massive praise to all those involved in creating such a beautiful film, well done, thank you and please carry on."
80,Song of the Sea,9,14 February 2016,A French Gem,"""Song of the Sea"" is a vibrant and beautiful French animation, certainly meriting its Oscar Nomination of 2015, and in all honesty a better story and concept than ""Big Hero Six"". The color in Sea is fantastic, really beyond comparison. And the characters are imaginative, fun, and magical. The story is simple and the voice acting competent. This is the first time I'd seen Moore movie though I'd read he has an earlier in entry I will certainly look up now. Some detractors may say the animation is untraditional or 2-D, and it is both, but I'd say that lends to its originality and style rather than detracts. In an odd way the animation pays homage to ""Peanuts"" I thought. Anyway, highly recommended. 9/10 Best animation movie from the last year or two."
81,Song of the Sea,8,11 February 2016,Masterpiece on so many levels,"Lately I've been having problems concentrating on a film, even really good ones. But this just took my breath away. The animation style is just fantastic with its watercolour look, enchanting patterns and distorted perspectives. throughout the whole thing I bought myself thinking on almost every cut ''that'd make a great art print'', that's how good it was. I know that one cannot judge a whole film by its art style (yet in this one it makes up a great deal of the whole), and i also know that people have found the plot of this movie lacking. Well, I think that they're wrong. I really enjoyed the plot. It's one of those good, family friendly kind of plots where it's easy to enjoy in the moment for those less developed (immature kids and grown ups) and still bringing up discussion and questions for those more progressed (mature kids and grown ups). Overall it's just a really pleasing movie for everyone; the art freak, the film nerd and the annoying nephew."
82,Song of the Sea,,7 February 2016,This is my favorite movie.,"""Song of the Sea"" directed by Tomm Moore is a beautifully animated movie about a boy named Ben and his sister Saoirse as they try to sing a song to release fairies from there stone curse. This movie's soundtrack is perfect for the type of movie they were making. The characters are well acted to sound believable and relate able to understand how they are feeling. Even the main villain isn't entirely evil as someone trying to solve a problem but in bad ways. If you are parents, I 100% recommend you show these to your children. If you can find a blu ray version of the movie, make sure you buy it for the best experience on my favorite movie of all time."
83,Song of the Sea,9,5 February 2016,You just need to watch it quietly,"Nowadays most of the animations are made with high-tech special effects, all subjects are so vivid that you can even every single fur of the animal or every single hair of a person. But this movie, combined eastern typical animation patterns with Irish cultural elements, generated a unique movie that fulfilled with its national features. The seemingly rugged lines and original style of the scenes perfectly elaborated the simplicity of the human nature. Yet if you watch carefully, you'll find that each scene, for instance, in the caves or in the ocean, is designed out of thorough consideration, all backgrounds, patterns and characters, they just match so perfect.Actually, you don't even need to observe anything, you just need to watch quietly, and follow the story to dig out the most simple and pure thing in the world."
84,Song of the Sea,8,24 January 2016,A children's film for adults. But kids will like it too.,"Before aspirations of going into some facet of the film industry, I had the desire to be an animator. The thought of having complete control over a boundless world was a thrill to me. But the difficulty level of such an endeavor proved to be a bit daunting, leaving those more tenacious than myself to forge ahead. And be glad they did. If not for the few with a true love (and talent) for displaying their imagination on screen for all to watch, we would have missed out on so many worthwhile stories. It's a gift that most never appreciate in terms of the time and effort which goes into making a full length feature (Let alone a 5 minute short). We look at animation as cartoons to plop our kids in front of to make them quiet. But they're so much more than a child's medium and deserve our respect, both the project itself, but also their creators. That said, I give you Song Of The Sea (2014).A young girl named Saoirse discovers that she can change into a seal. With the help of her older brother, Ben, they embark on an adventure that could save the world and shed a light on what befell their mother the night Saoirse was born. That's the short version. To tell more might be doing you a disservice. That, and I could not tell this story a tenth as well as the creators of this film do. Song Of The Sea was one of those animated features that got buried under the mountain of big studio bells and whistles kid fodder that, although fun, give higher brow pictures an unfair rep as being just 'kid's stuff'. Brought to us by Tomm Moore, the director behind The Secret Of Kells (2009), Song Of The Sea adds to the strong resume Moore is building. I enjoyed both of those films thoroughly, but don't expect your usual animated fair. There are stories to tell and don't necessarily come second to the visuals, which are a subtle mix of mainstream animation and smooth-lined Celtic inspired artwork. A style which reflects it's dedication to the culture that gave it life."
85,Song of the Sea,10,7 November 2015,A beautiful modern fairytale,"It is clearly set in modern day, but the story has strong fairytale vibes, weaving in folklore and legends with the endearing 2D animation, and the folktales seem to have parallels with much of what the adult characters are experiencing.This is the tale of a little boy who discovers that his sister is a selkie. We don't often get to see touching stories about a brother and a sister, and this was a welcome addition!It was also refreshing to watch a 2D animated movie; the medium is seriously dwindling. This is a film from the same people who made Secret of Kells, and in my opinion, this was much better."
86,Song of the Sea,10,11 October 2015,Another example that shows Irish animation is world class!,"People, I kid you not. An amazing, animation studio from Ireland by the name of Cartoon Saloon has arisen, and it is bound to have a legendary status. The creators behind Song of the Sea (2014) are undeniably some of the most creative and passionate people in the animation industry. You can tell it from just watching their movies!Their latest feature Song of the Sea (2014) is yet another example that shows Irish animation is world class. Like their previous works, this animated feature is beautiful and it feels so magical looking at them. What's more about this animated feature is its heartwarming theme and interesting, lovable characters, making it immensely captivating and entertaining.Honestly, most of the characters (human or not) are gorgeous and it's difficult to not love them! It has plenty of charming Irish mythological figures such as Selkie, Mac Lir the giant, Tír na nÓg, Seanachai and Macha in addition to Ben and Saoirse's cute family!The protagonists, Ben and Saoirse are also inspiring. They are just children who felt mostly lonely at home but they are very brave. These siblings learned to get along with each other and the elder brother grows up most; he has learned to be more open-minded and on how to be a responsible big brother!Ending this post, I must say that Song of the Sea (2014) is awesome! With nice music and vivid animations, their adventure in this animated feature is nothing like we've seen before! If you love mythology, I am sure you will love it! Give them a try and I am sure you will love them instantly, as much as I do!PS. This is my 92th animated movie review and it is one of the very rare that gets a rating of 10 out of 10 stars!"
87,Song of the Sea,9,9 October 2015,"She turns to me, song of the sea","The Song of the Sea opens with a story based on Irish mythic folklore; a selkie woos a human man before leaving behind a half human baby. Of course we don't know that yet; to us she's the elegant Bronagh, who gently sends us to sleep with that Irish Gaelic hymn that acts as the sweetest musical motif to ever grace the screen. There's moments of magic throughout. In one spellbinding scene, the young and silent Saoirse slips into her skin and becomes a shimmering white seal diving into the ocean. The animation becomes fluid as she effortlessly glides through the deep sea like a wet paintbrush sliding against blue paper, creating a watery swathe. The score gently lifts with harp and strings, and not a word is spoken, but we are so sure that she is at home in the sea. I am reminded of Journey and its majestic score and graceful sand- sliding. The traditional animation style is simplistic yet beautiful; shots seems lifted from a storybook like those cross sections of the Faeries pipes and the sinking down the underwater chasm. But there are also sections of intricate layers that seem to jump right off the page; the roundabout that has cars wheeling around it, and that seemingly bottomless pool in the holy shrine that entices us to dive in. The characters are designed with the same amount of loving detail and care. Conor, voiced tenderly by Brendan Gleeson, is a hulking figure with strong curves and enveloping arms but is heartbroken and forlorn. The design of the grandmother and the owl lady Macha mirror each other, both driven by desire to do away with suffering and provide blissful comfort, but one in a more darker (and in her innate back-story, more tragic) manner. The blinking saucer eyes, the little smile and wayward limbs tell us more about Saoirse than any dialogue would; in the middle of the film, Ben once again wraps the dog leash around her, this time in a more protective manner, and she playfully swings her legs in a way only children do. Song of the Sea captures childhood remarkably without ever feeling childlike. This is a rarity in modern animation; there are no superfluous characters that offer low brow comic relief (the closest we get is the sheepdog Cú, but he is sweet and loving and provides the sort of care that Conor lacks in his heartbreak - they are even drawn with the same sort of curving form), no attempts to dumb down the characters or motives. Anyone who grows up with a sibling can empathise with Ben's initial woes; the fighting and pushing, the jealous coveting of belongings, taunting with elaborate scary stories, running away from home. Their long car journey is characterised by a crudely drawn crayon map, scribbling the kind of odd details and sights only a child would notice. David Rawle is crucial to this relationship; his voice acting is excellent, with just a hint of biting scorn that older siblings are familiar with, yet youthful in his wide eyed wonder at discovering the myths of his childhood being reality. Macha, the crazy owl lady, is the so called villain of the story, but again, Moore shifts direction and weaves a sorrowful motive for her act of literally bottling emotions. It is reminiscent of Yubaba from Spirited Away, another maternal figure that frightens young protagonists. The personality of Zeniba is also within Macha, but is hidden away, forcefully pushed down under layers of grief. Ben and Saoirse release the bottled up emotions, and for the first time in forever, she chuckles and her cheeks grow warm, and then her tears fall like the mini rainstorms above her. These elemental emotions are stylised very simply, but it is effective enough to produce that moment of catharsis. A unexpected moment in the middle of the film occurs when we get an extended flashback to Bronagh as the beginning delved into, but here it is even more tragic because we have come to know Ben and how he has transformed his grief at his mother leaving into contempt for Saoirse. We know this not because of a voice-over, or maybe some telling remark from the Great Seanachai storyteller and keeper of memories, but because of the intricately shaped characterisation and persona that has been stony cold throughout. This is right until he witnesses Bronagh abandoning the family again in fully fleshed out detail, and tears start streaming for the first time. Later he pleads for Saoirse to stay with them, and we fully believe him. It is not easy to create this type of longing, even if the character arcs seem predictable. Song of the Sea is a gorgeous and evocative example of how animation should be done. The soothing sounds of Lisa Hannigan's Amhrán Na Farraige effortlessly captivate a viewer; watching this is like slowly being lulled to sleep."
88,Song of the Sea,10,13 September 2015,Beautiful Contemporary Fairy tale.,"This is quite simply a brilliant masterpiece of animation. The combination of modern and ancient commingles in both the narrative and the animation style, topping it off with some gorgeous music, wrapping everything together in a solid and creative movie experience.Ben as the protagonist was somewhat less enjoyable at first as he comes across as a bit to bratty, but it is an honest child-like bratty that eventually is shed as he comes into his own. He realizes he has done wrong and to make up for his attitude, a good character development throughout the film, and your opinion in him somewhat changes as he does.The narrative itself flows well, and the two siblings relationship grows throughout the movie which was well paced. The layers of similarities between some of the mythological characters and the human characters, particularly Ben and the Mac Lier giant and the destructive nature of tragedy, and Ben's Grandmother and the immortal Macha as mothers who come across as bad due to their ultimately overprotective actions with their sons, with correlation further enhanced by near similarity in character style and the fact that they were both voiced by the same actress Fionnula Flanagan. These comparative relationships add just the right touch of thoughtful complexity to a contemporary fairy tale, and the theme of the relationships between stories and people."
89,Song of the Sea,8,17 August 2015,Should give it a try and watch with little ones,"I like the drawing style!Before watching this I warn you that the plot is very simple, thus if you are the kind who demand a complete, complicated and exciting plots then you will be let down by this bed-time story. A lot of plot-holes that left unexplained; many riddles left unanswered. Witches, owls, seals, a dog, fairies and selkies (at first I thought it was selfies....)and all that. Great and very suitable for little ones to watch, and of course the adults too. Drop all your logical sense and judgement of how a story should start and how it should end. This is about a journey so take the ride and enjoy the lullaby of the song. Song of the sea reminds me the feeling of listening to my imaginations' I used to have at bed-time. Oh, how I miss it."
90,Song of the Sea,10,5 August 2015,Beautiful creation.,"This movie is simple and stunning. It may not be in 3D alike other leading titles in the animation genre, but its visuals quite easily defeat those of quite a few 3D titles. According to me, Wall-E would probably be the only movie that would match up to this one. But, enough about the visuals. On to the story. I shall be nice and not give spoilers (although I really do want to!). The movie has one of the best written plots I have encountered in a long time. The movie may seem childish at first, but upon perceiving it at a certain level of depth, one will notice that the story has mature undertones. Family is quite possibly the main theme in the story, other than the fairy-tale setting of the movie. Emotional individuals may find themselves tear- stricken by the end of the movie. (I kinda did..) There is a lack of funny moments in the movie although, according to me, the inclusion of comic relief in such a story may well diminish it's emotional appeal and the very essence of the movie. The movie does have tense moments. Ones people would not expect from an animated movie. The nail-biting moments are short, well-written and quickly handled. It has been a long time since this movie was released. And I am quite late with my review of it. But this is solely because the movie did not meet a lot of response, and hence, it may be one of the best animated movies that the world was ignorant towards. Perhaps this was because of its 2D visuals or because of the childish aura the movie initially propagates.I myself did not know of this movie until a few days back. I am grateful for getting an opportunity to enjoy it. It's gorgeous visuals, emotionally clenching story and stunning music sets it apart from a large number of animated titles and makes it a treat for all ages."
91,Song of the Sea,,1 April 2015,A sweet film for kids with one appalling detail not appropriate for kids.,"Just a word of warning if you have young kids of reading age. Prominantly seen several times is a sign on a door that reads:Keep out! Feic Off! No Humans!His is highly inappropriate for my 8 year old who is just learning how to read and sounding out words. This film is PG and this should have not been there. Aside from that it is a well made film with a lot of interesting themes and visuals that never failed to hold my family's attention. It is a bit dark, especially that ending, older viewers will have no issues here but if you are trying to keep the little ones away from harsh profanity and they're old enough to read, keep that in mind when spinning this disc."
