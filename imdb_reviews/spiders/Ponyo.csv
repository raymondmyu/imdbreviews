0,Ponyo,8,27 July 2008,All the Enthusiasm of Finger Paints,"Gake no Ue no Ponyo is like something you might get if you mashed My Neighbour Totoro into The Little Mermaid, then put the entire project in the hands of a five-year-old animation prodigy. The film is simultaneously stunning in its beauty and endearing in its simplicity, unrestrained enthusiasm walking the edge between inspired brilliance and mind-addling delirium.In the opening sequences, literally thousands of individually animated fish swirl across the screena task Western animators wouldn't touch without a room full of computers. And yet the film's omnipresent water is defined by hard lines that seem to have been drawn in with crayons and coloured by pastels. In style and content, this is clearly a children's fantasy, and yet it isn't.Remarkably, Miyazaki has yet again achieved what he created in Totoro: a film that draws the viewer indelibly into the world of children, reminding us of the time when every discovery was unique, every possession precious, and the agony of loss crouched behind every well-meaning mistake. Perhaps this is why the film has appealed more to adults than to children in Japan: children still live in this world. They need no such reminders.Sousuke, a five-year-old who retrieves the eponymous Ponyo from the ocean, is not another Pinocchio-like screen caricature. He is a real boy. He is intelligent yet careless, deeply conscientious but distracted by impulse. He grounds us in a world that wavers between the real and the surreal.Wide-eyed wizard Fujimoto, voiced with narcoleptic mania by comedian Tokoro Joji, is by far the most rational of the film's fantastical creations. He's an oddball, but he makes sense. But when waves begin to lap at the doorstep to Sousuke's hilltop home and the townsfolk jovially pile into rowboats to scud over a swollen sea of prehistoric fish, we begin to wonder whether this is the real world or some beatific daydream. Miyazaki draws no clear distinction.Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a children's love story, driven with monomaniacal ferocity by Ponyo and Sousuke's pure mutual affection. Composer Joe Hisaishi underscores this intensity, calling up mighty swells of strings to accompany Ponyo's first ascent to the surface, and later evoking Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries in a stunning sequence where Ponyo chases down a speeding car while running atop a cascading tsunami of gigantic fish.While the film loses much of its energythough none of its eccentricityin the final act, Miyazaki has nonetheless succeeded in creating yet another modern fairy tale. It is a simple, pure vision, guilelessly washed across with a devoted kindergartener's finger paints."
1,Ponyo,10,25 December 2008,A Nutshell Review: Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea,"Hayao Miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated film, which turns on the usual sweetness to charm your socks off. I thought that the trailer featured its song which was quietly hypnotic, and I didn't have to wait for an invite to make sure I got my ticket for the sneak preview of the movie, scheduled to open here next week.For fans of Studio Ghibli films, you'll probably know what you're in for, as Miyazaki has yet another winner in his filmography, that will win new fans over. I'm embarrassed to say the least that I've so far watched only My Neighbour Totoro (eyes that pile of Ghibli DVDs) and love it to bits, but I guess this would serve as a final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated films that I would enjoy.Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuria) is a magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea, with her constant forays in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a peek. Nonetheless these ambitions do not bode well with her humanoid dad Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who harbours some hatred toward the human race for pollution, and briefly touching a subplot on environmental protection / revenge by Mother Nature as well. An accident one day sees Ponyo being washed ashore, and picked up by five year old boy Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) who lives on a house on the said cliff with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while dad Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mostly out to sea since he's a sailor. And you can expect some moments of throwback to the likes of The Little Mermaid, or Splash made for kids. Saying anything more would be to spoil the fun.The artwork here is still simply astounding even though it's in 2D glory, knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked on. There are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame, that you'll probably be game for repeated viewings just to spot them all. This definitely beats any 3D or CG animated production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity, and not only from the artwork department, but on its story too, despite complaints coming in that it took a leaf from the Hans Christian Andersen classic. While there are avenues to make this film extremely dark, it only suggested certain dark themes, but opted instead for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both kids and adults alike.At its core, its about love, that between the family members of Koichi, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. More so, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened Ponyo, and I tell you Ponyo herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of Bolt, WallE and Eve all hands down. Characterization here is top notch, and it's hard not to fall in love with Ponyo, in whichever form adopted, especially when she's such a playful being who doesn't hide her emotions - if she's upset with you, either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face!Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a definite shoo-in to my top films of this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure as hell going to make my way to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world brought to us by Hayao Miyazaki. Highly recommended film, so don't you go missing this on the big screen!"
2,Ponyo,10,19 July 2008,Another Classic Miyazaki,"Whenever Hayao Miyazaki does the ""tri-fecta,"" (writes, directs, and animates a movie) he makes a classic film for the ages. He has done it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo.The story is about a girl fish who is kept on a very tight leash along with her younger sisters by her father, a bitter ex-human wizard named Fujimoto. The fish escapes from her father and rides a jellyfish to shore, where she is caught up in a dredging operation and finds herself stuck in a bottle. This underwater sequence must be one of the most elaborately drawn animated scenes ever undertaken and stands on its own as a reason to search out the theatrical release. Miyazaki, who shows no fear of having a busy scene, has outdone himself. There were literally hundreds of individually-drawn sea creatures of every imaginable size all in motion at the same time.When the fish escapes the dredging operation while still trapped in the bottle, a five-year old boy named Sousuke spots her in the water and is able to break the bottle, saving her. Since she is the result of her father's magic, she is capable of magic herself--and her father actively tries to retrieve her. The boy names the fish Ponyo. Just when Sousuke learns that Ponyo can speak, her father successfully retrieves her back into captivity.After a war of wills with her father, Ponyo manages to escape again with the ability to change herself into a human. She meets up again with Sousuke in a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways. There is a cuteness factor in this film rivaling and arguably surpassing that of Tonari no Totoro. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided outstanding musical support.The story itself is simple--as are Miyazaki's films in general--and should appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers. While I haven't viewed it enough to be sure, the film doesn't seem to be one which will keep scholars in long discussions as Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi did. Nonetheless, this is the ultimate feel-good entertainment movie. I gave the movie a ten out of ten rating."
3,Ponyo,7,27 July 2008,"A whimsical, fantastic and visually amazing film that is a pure delight for   all ages.","Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood. At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories. The story revolves around the friendship between a magical sea sprite/goldfish and the human child that she encounters during a curious outing to see the human world. The human child, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) lives in a small house on a cliff overlooking a small port city in Southern Japan (based on Seto Island) where he lives with his young mom, Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke names the strange goldfish ""Ponyo"" and takes it to the daycare/nursing center that Lisa works at. Ponyo is definitely not your typical goldfish and soon begins to adapt and take on human aspects (she develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat) by sampling some blood from a cut on Sosuke's finger. Yet just as Sosuke and Ponyo begin to develop a bond, Ponyo is taken back by her father, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji) who is a former human who has rejected the surface world and is now attempting to collect and develop magical elixirs taken from the sea that aid him in repairing and rejuvenating the world's oceans.Ponyo's desire to become human has become so strong however that Fujimoto is unable to contain her anymore and she takes on a more human appearance and breaks free from her water world home and goes back to see Sosuke. During her breakout, Ponyo unintentionally releases Fujimoto's cache of magical elixirs which unleashes all sorts of magical sea creatures that causes a violent storm in the seas surrounding Sosuke's town. Desperate to resolve Ponyo's rebellion, he soon calls upon the help of his beautiful wife, Ponyo's mother - the water elemental, Mother/Lady of the Sea (Amami Yuki). As with his past films, Miyazaki's ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" touches upon various themes of ecology and environmentalism, this time focusing on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening sequence is at times sobering when Ponyo encounters a drudging vessel which is scraping the ocean's floor, uncovering mountains of garbage and debris. One can understand the anger and frustration of the character of Fujimoto who has spent his lifetime trying to repair the damage civilization is doing to its oceans, yet finding it an daunting and almost fruitless endeavor.Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film. It is at times bizarre and outrageous but at the same time charming and curious. Clearly Miyazaki wanted to capture the sense and style of a child's imagination. The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful. It is almost like a child's color book come to life.Child actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do great work as Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring adorable charm to their roles. Nara Yuria in particular sounds so darn cute as Ponyo that it is little wonder that Doi's Sosuke falls for the magical girl. Former campaign girl/model and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Swallowtail) is also very good in her role as Sosuke's modern mom, Lisa. I was a bit confused at first by her character as I initially thought she was Sosuke's older sister. It also didn't help that Sosuke kept referring to her as ""Lisa"" rather than Mom but I guess it is perhaps a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern Japanese family (in the anime series Crayon Shinchan, Shinnosuke also refers to his mom by first name as well).80s comedian Tokoro Joji sounds totally different as the serious Fujimoto but wisely doesn't make his character sound cartoony villainous or goofy menacing. While we don't get to know his character more, former pro-baseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige ( who portrays Sosuke's father Koichi) also delivers some nice voice work. The opening theme ""Umi No Okasan"" by Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is simply beautiful and stirring. In contrast the Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi ""Geke No Ue No Ponyo"" theme is light and amusing and evokes images of a traditional Japanese nursery rhyme. During one brilliant sequence the soundtrack takes on an almost Wagnerian operatic sound with music that sounds like ""Die Walküre"".The film is not perfect however and does suffer from moments where the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke takes a back seat to some of Miyazaki's overwhelming fantastical visuals. I also had wished we had more time to explore Fujimoto's back-story as well as the relationship between Sosuke and his father.Like ""Kiki's Delivery Service/Majo No Takkyubin"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"", ""Princess Momonoke/Momonoke Hime"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro/Tonari No Totoro"", ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" is another Miyazaki classic that is a marvelous feast for the eyes. Like a modern day fairytale, the film tells a timeless story of friendship and love that will surely be cherished in years to come."
4,Ponyo,9,16 August 2009,"It's like drugs....good drugs,....but still drugs!  And drugs that the whole family can enjoy!","I have a strong feeling that what you think of this film will strongly depend on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will probably confuse the heck out of you. If you have seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will still probably confuse the heck out of you....but you won't really care! That's because I found that the first time I saw one of his animated films, I tried too hard to figure out what was happening and why--and it impacted my enjoyment of the film. Now that I have seen just about every Miyazaki film, I see the bizarreness and just take it all in--enjoying the beauty of it all. In many ways, these films (at least to Western audiences) is like drugs--lots of strange and beautiful images that don't always initially make sense but sure feel great to see!! Of all the Miyazaki films, this might have the most unusual and incomprehensible story line--even more so than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But, like these and many other Studio Gibli films, if you just sit back and watch you are rewarded with a fabulous tale. But, because it is so hard to describe (and others have already done so), I won't even go there.As for the artwork, it's very typical of one of these Japanese films, though there was one noticeable change. There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds. This was NOT a bad thing at all--the lovely pastel-like look was very pleasing and unique. In some ways it looked like a tiny bit of Bill Plympton's art style was infused into a typical Miyazaki film. With a high frame-rate, exceptional character animation (which imbued them with tons of personality) and a great ""wow-factor"", this is an exceptional film for all ages. Though clearly designed more for younger audiences (the TOTORO fans especially), it is a bit scary here and there (during the storm segments) but there is plenty of great stuff for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically so), I loved the cute stuff and applaud the other-worldliness of the film.A great film--among Miyazaki's best. I don't give it a 10 because I am hesitant to ever do that--plus I did like a few of the studio's other films a bit more (particularly TOTORO). But that DOESN'T mean you shouldn't rush out now and see it--do it and do yourself a favor."
5,Ponyo,7,20 July 2008,Great movie for kids but something was missing,"As a long-time fan of Studio Ghibli and especially Hayao Miyazaki films, I went to the film right on the opening day. When I went out of the theater I had this strange feeling that something was missing, this ""magical"" feeling I was experiencing in all Miyazaki films before, but I couldn't say why it failed this time. After I thought about the other Ghibli movies, I may know the reason: this film had most of the elements of a great Miyazaki anime: cute characters, wonderful key animation, a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and the warm story telling giving you the feeling of watching a high quality Japanese animation film. However, two elements were lacking: a deep story and dramaturgy. The purpose of this film was obviously to entertain small children with a simple story line as in case of ""Totoro"", so a complicated story as been told in ""Spirited Away"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" is not really necessary, but on the other hand, this story was simply too superficial. I could not connect to the main characters, because there was no character development, dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long. I really hate to give only 7 stars for a Miyazaki film, because I would give 10 stars to all previous movies right away, but this time it was simply not this wonderful ""ghibli experience""."
6,Ponyo,,13 September 2008,A Totoro for the Noughties,"After the epic fairytale worlds of Howl's Moving Castle and (the underwhelming) Tales from Earthsea, Studio Ghibli's latest is a return to good old 80s Ghibli.The brainchild of Master Miyazaki himself, it lacks the elaborate plot of the likes of Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away and makes do with far less characters. Instead we finally go back to seeing the world through the curious, wide-open eyes of a child.The story is based on Andersen's The Little Mermaid, but as the film progresses it becomes its own dreamlike vision. Ponyo is a 5-year old fish princess living in her family's underwater kingdom, and when she meets Sousuke, a boy of the same age, decides she wants to become human herself, much to her father's dismay.The underwater scenes are spectacular; as one would expect in a Miyazaki picture, they are full of strange, wonderful creatures that resemble something we may have seen in reality and yet are completely unique in their own right. During the initial sequence that's set in this colourful, mysteriously illuminated realm, the first point of comparison that came to my mind was the impressive ocean setting in Finding Nemo. However, where the Pixar film uses 3D graphics of all sorts to create stunningly realistic and impressive images, Ponyo uses a wide range of colours and shapes to create an equally, if not more, stunning fantasy kingdom. There is not a single CGI pixel anywhere in this film, yet the textures are lavishly rich, and the movements of light, the sea and its inhabitants incredibly fluent. The underwater scenes alone are a stunning artistic achievement.The rest of the film's visuals, however, impress just as much with their lovely but never kitschy pastel palette and the ever-loving detail that can be found in every single frame. The casual drawing style of Sousuke's house against the lavish green field in the background, the gorgeously peaceful town, or a glowing, golden moon are only a few examples of the many memorable images.Like in the now-20 year old classic, My Neighbour Totoro, the protagonists are young children, and a large part of the film's charm lies in their portrayal. Ever since I was a child and watched Heidi or Anne of Green Gables, (though I've only realised now), what's fascinated me about Miyazaki's animation is the accuracy in which it replicates children's movements, mimicry and mannerisms. Ponyo is a stubborn girl who, like any little princess, can get quite angry if not given what she wants ( though with more serious consequences than with most other children). And when she does, she behaves and moves in the exact same way that you see little kids do it every day in real life. 8-year old voice actress Nara Yuria also does a fantastic job in bringing Ponyo to life and making her the unbelievably lovable, cheeky little sh!t that she is. While she is delightfully hilarious in her half-fish, half-child shape that defies classification, Ponyo never becomes boring once she assumes her human shape. One of the most (literally) heartwarming moments of the film is when, as a human child, Ponyo tastes milk with honey for the first time, truly savouring the experience. The delighted expression on her little face reminded me of my own childhood firsts and gave me that warm fuzzy feeling in my chest. In many ways, Ponyo is very reminiscent of Mei in Totoro.Like Totoro, Ponyo also has a good old-fashioned opening sequence, and a title song you won't forget too soon after hearing it. Performed by little Ohashi Nozomi, the terribly catchy tune is a perfect sing-along for any child, young or old.And again, like its famous predecessor, some reviewers have noted (somewhat critically at times), that Ponyo is aimed at a much younger audience than the more recent Ghibli films. I'd like to phrase it differently and say that this is the first Ghibli in a while that doesn't exclude this target group completely. This film is of course for children, but (yes, as with Totoro) its merit lies in its many delights  the lovingly precise portrayal of children's behaviour, the many moments of wonder and the sheer artistic vision.By the end of the fastest one-hundred minutes ever, I had that silly smile on my face, and I knew I'd once again witnessed true Miyazaki magic.Of course we'll have to see how well this one will hold up over repeated viewings and how it will be regarded in a decades time, but for now I'll say: Move over, Totoro.10/10. Now go see it!"
7,Ponyo,10,24 January 2009,Master is on form and welcomes a new generation of Miyasaki followers,"Quite simply, i was tickled pink watching this in the movie theatre and grinned from ear to ear; eyes wide open whilst trying to take all the details in that are at the same time insanely simple, fresh, yet incredibly sophisticated, breathtaking and in imaginative.In terms of audience age range, it is probably pre Totoro. The plot works because of the pure heart of 5 years olds who are focused in what they want and conscientious in their pursuit. They lives in a world that is unspoilt by cynicism and cultural learning of how everything is 'suppose' to work. While most critics might disregard this film due to the lack of a 'message' or 'plot' film (Although it is in there somewhere), it is precisely for this reason the film should be cherished. Too often our judgement are impeded by our own limitations of cinematic and cultural standing. Like most of Miyasaki's film, each is totally unique but undeniably Miyasaki. Ponyo may at times feel so unique and fresh, it may feel alien like.The viewing experience provide a wonderful change from all the generic children's products that are generally commercialised to please the adult demographics (ie/ Animals that talks like their human counterparts, Eddie Murphy in Shrek.) It is perhaps comforting to know that good old fashioned hand drawn cells still work so incredibly well in this digital era where Toystory/WallE/Shrek/Cars generally triumph. It therefore feeling rather nostalgic at the same time makes the film feels timeless, a bit like how Totoro and Jungle Book hasn't really aged.The subtleties of each character's expression and body language is captured in such nuanced interpretation that digital films like Wall-e can never compete on, or if it does, it would be a very expensive process. It would be a big pity for Wall-E to win over this one at the Oscars, and it probably will this year. Yet it might be quite unfair to compare the 2 mediums, as it is really the craftsmanship and the story telling that wins at the end of the day. For this, Miyasaki is a true master of"
8,Ponyo,9,27 May 2009,More juvenile than Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle but still gorgeous.,"While Hayao Miyazaki's movies have always been hit-or-miss with me with regards to story, they are unequivocally gorgeous to the eye, with characters of simple animation against a backdrop of artistic images. Ponyo sticks to that formula, with a lead character so adorable I want a plush doll of her and scenery so pretty it wouldn't look out of place framed up as a picture on a wall.The story, on the other hand, I didn't enjoy quite as much as his last two wide-releases, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. It was just a tad too juvenile, coming across as more for kids and leaving adults to just enjoy the animation.I was also disappointed that the score done by Joe Hisaishi, who also the scores for the above-mentioned two movies, wasn't nearly as memorable this time around. While I can't quite recall Howl's score now, I still remember it being one of the most beautiful I had ever heard. Ditto Spirited's - though I only remember it being very complementary to the movie. Maybe it's because Ponyo is more juvenile fare that the score isn't quite as haunting. In any case, this movie is still a must-watch for fans of anime or Miyazaki."
9,Ponyo,10,21 August 2008,Not your usual Ghibli fare but wonderful nonetheless,"This is the latest Ghibli movie and it is also a MAJOR departure from the studio's established style. First of all, this film was obviously aimed at young children, much more so than any of their previous films. It lacks the depth of the other films and features a brand new far less realistic style of animation and yet it is ever so entertaining. Even though there is nothing put in to attract adults, I still found myself drawn to the screen and fully immersed in the story. The movie's secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters. The story and the characters are very upfront with their feelings/intentions etc. but that makes them all the more endearing. Special attention was also paid to the soundtrack which is absolutely amazing despite being way different from previous Ghibli soundtracks. I find myself singing the cute theme song all the time as will anyone who sees this movie!"
10,Ponyo,10,26 March 2009,Miyazaki's best after Totoro,"Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli shows his wonderful touch animating, infusing life, in every little action of the characters in Ponyo. When Sosuke puts down so carefully his little boat to reach for the red fish you know that you'll have a very good time watching this movie. The characters are interesting and you really care for them. They recall visually other stories, Riisa seems a grown up Nausicaa with a son, an old lady in wheelchair remembers the witch in Howl's Moving Castle.The presence of the elements, wind, rain, and the sea with its great, powerful waves, is so strong that I think it has never been evoked in such a way in any other movie. It is a simple story, loosely inspired by ""the little mermaid"", and it reach for the very heart of the audience, just like Totoro, the other Miyazaki's true masterpiece. An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits. Don't miss it."
11,Ponyo,5,1 April 2010,Unsatisfying,"I thought long and hard before giving the film this score, but there are simply too many things that make Ponyo not work for me. This latest animated movie from Miyazaki, who needs no introductions, had the intriguing premise of the sea. He spoke of the sea being a character in itself. I was intrigued to see the movie. I knew it had two children as the frontline, but being a fan of My Neighbour Totoro, I knew that Miyazaki has an unreal insight into the mindset of children.The very first scene of Ponyo is breathtaking. Hundreds of fishes and jellyfish accompanied by breathtaking, oceanic music, finally zooming in on a man in a pinstriped suit, creating a bubble around his ship. We later find out that he is the father of one of the main characters, the fish girl Ponyo who wants to become human after befriending Sotsuke, a 5-year old boy living in a house by the sea. She is able to do this with a mixture of her father's magic (which she's inherited) and Sotsuke's blood (a drop of which she licked when he cut himself).The problem with Ponyo is the vagueness of the story. There is practically no sense of conflict to the story at all. There is no substantial threat to the characters, and they have very little development. That the characters are so young shouldn't justify this, if we remember Mei in My Neighbour Totoro. Also, Ponyo's father is so at odds with practically everything in the movie's universe, it's hilarious and off-putting at the same time. Ponyo herself is, personally, creepy rather than cute (and her numerous little siblings are no different). I don't understand how nobody finds it peculiar that Ponyo, supposedly a goldfish, has a humanoid face (and Sotsuke shows her to quite a few people). It's even weirder when Lisa (Sotsuke's mother, whom he oddly always refers to by name), an intelligent woman, sees Ponyo eat a slice of ham in whole (as a goldfish) and isn't at all surprised about it. The only really developed character, and the warmest, is the loudest of the old women at the retirement home where Lisa works.What Ponyo lacks in substance, it makes up for in visuals. The movie's highlight in my opinion is where Lisa and Sotsuke are driving down a road continually drenched in waves, on top of which Ponyo is running. These waves take on the form of giant fish. A wonderful piece of animation. The many underwater scenes are beautiful, with underwater creatures big and small swimming. Something about the overall production values of the visuals feel a bit unfocused, though. The morse code scene is then hilarious.On the whole, however, Ponyo feels like a lot of elements that just don't work together. Sotsuke faces no real trials like other young Miyazaki protagonists have faced. None of the characters feel like they serve any real purpose other than to bring Sotsuke and Ponyo together. The film's subplot of Ponyo's magic causing a rift in the natural order and causing the moon to come closer (which explains the flood) is never sufficiently delivered to the audience.I was simply expecting a better delivery from a master storyteller like Miyazaki. Ponyo may only really work for the smallest children, but that's excluding a large part of Miyazaki's fanbase. He's one of those filmmakers whom I respect for continually showing people that animated movies can be for people of all ages. Ponyo obviously aims at a lower age group, but I just hope that the children will be more drawn into Sotsuke and Ponyo's story than I was (there is so much courteous and/or cute dialogue that I felt downright embarrassed at points).Decent, but definitely not the brightest spot in Miyazaki's repertoire."
12,Ponyo,5,15 August 2009,"Where Anything Can Happen, Who Cares What Does?","Ponyo (G, 1:43)  Fantasy: Fairy Tales, 2nd string, remakeWell, I suppose it was unrealistic to expect to hit the trifecta in a single weekend, but I must confess my surprise that the flik that proved to be the dud in the trio was this confection from Hayao Miyazaki, acknowledged master of anime and the genius behind My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke.As expected, the artwork was ethereal, whimsical, and utterly charming. It's all hand-drawn in the original 2-D cel-animation style that was state of the art for 7 decades. It's Miyazaki's trademark, and it doesn't disappoint.Unfortunately, this time around it's in service of a wandering, inchoate, ultimately pointless plot loosely drawn from Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Little Mermaid"" (which is why I somewhat hesitantly label it a remake).You would not recognize the mermaid, however, and certainly shouldn't be expecting Disney's Ariel. Ponyo (Noah Lindsey Cyrus) starts out, we are told, as a goldfish, but the strangest little goldfish you ever saw, with a human face, bright orange hair, no fins, and a lower trunk that looks like that of a Hummel figurine, except wiggly. Oh, and she's about the size of your fist. At that, she's 3-4 times bigger than the hundreds of other goldfish  a giggling gaggle of miniature Ponyettes (her sisters?)  who inhabit the same hole in the seabed and continue to put in guest appearances thruout the movie.Ponyo is carried to the surface atop a jellyfish following in the wake of her ""father"" Fujimoto. He apparently qualifies for the title not because he's the King Goldfish (he looks like an overdressed David Bowie) but because he's the father of everything in the sea, as well as their self-appointed protector. He purports to loathe human beings and, in one of several incongruously technical geological references, says he wants to bring about a new Cambrian Explosion. (I'm usually happy to encounter mention of Darwinian processes, but what the heck this is doing in a kids' fairy tale is beyond me.)Once near the surface, Ponyo gets her head trapped in a jelly jar, but she's freed by 5-year- old Sosuke (Frankie Jonas), an unfailingly kind and polite little boy whose mom (Risa or Lisa, Tina Fey) works in a retirement home and whose dad (Koichi, Matt Damon) is a frequently absent ship's captain. The family lives in a big rambling house on a cliff overlooking the sea, and it is here they repair after Ponyo sprouts legs, arms, and a hankering for ham sandwiches. Oh, and balloons up to the same size as Sosuke.There's a Greek chorus of old ladies at Lisa's workplace, the Moon comes to visit for an extended stay, a typhoon covers everything in 20 metres of standing water but causes no damage, ocean waves turn into fish with eyes, a toy boat gets magically enlarged to become a seaworthy craft, and Guran Mamere (Cate Blanchett), the spirit of the sea, arrives in time to help rebalance the karmic equilibrium of the planet.Wonders to behold, to be sure, but bearing no obvious connection to each other, just a bunch of novel ideas thrown together at random. It's clearly silly to expect cause-effect relationships, let alone explanations, but a certain minimal amount of coherence is necessary. In a world where anything can happen, who cares what does?"
13,Ponyo,7,6 February 2009,Return to Innocence - A Review of Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea,"Said to be inspired from Disney's The Little Mermaid, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is Japanese animation master, Hayao Miyazaki's next big work after the well-received Spirited Away in 2001 and Howl's Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo, his signature style of animating fantasy realms and children characters are on display once again.Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), the boy lead in the film discovers a 'goldfish' trapped in a glass jar while playing by the seaside below the cliff. He stays with his mum, Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) above and atop it. Sosuke shakes the jar forcefully to try and get the 'goldfish' out but the little 'goldfish' is stuck. He then tries to pull it out but it just cannot come loose. Sosuke then place the jar on the ground before smashing a small rock onto it, breaking it into pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger. He then checks inquisitively to see if the 'goldfish' is still alive. As he observes it, the 'goldfish' reacts by licking the blood off his finger suddenly. Excited, Sosuke quickly rushes back to the house and put the 'goldfish' in a small bucket of water in hope that it will survive. It did and he named it 'Ponyo'(Yuria Nara).The above scene would signify what is to come for the remainder of the film. It is of the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And it is one that Hayao Miyazaki did meticulously well in portraying. He must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before he depicts this chemistry of communication between the two main characters. The behavior of the children would also extend into the rest of the film in their further encounters.The affection between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progresses from the moment Sosuke brought Ponyo to school in Lisa's car. The best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief separation when Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro), a magical sea dweller recaptures the errant Ponyo before encapsulating her in a magic bubble with kind intention.Fujimoto who was once human has grown to refer humans with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing its life. But all Ponyo wants is to be human and be with Sosuke so for a second time she escapes, accidentally emptying his father's precious store of magical elixir into the sea, creating a storm of tidal waves and engulfing the small town in the process.What follows are the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded town.Is there a happily ever after in this one? Would true love prevail? You find out.Looking at the art in Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, there appears to be a deviation from Miyazaki's past works in terms of rendering. It looks unfamiliar because the environment apart from the characters at play in every scene is not colored in the usual fashion as in Spirited Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetical appeal is discounted from what appears to be color penciled drawings. The objects and characters are also not as detailed as before.This is peculiar if taken on face value but from the way the story is written and told, the possible explanation is that Miyazaki is allowing the audience to view the film with a child's tint, yet allowing the adults to reminisce on a Japan when they were younger. This move could have prevented prospective moviegoers, new to Miyazaki's work to see it. The trailer did nothing to promote Ponyo as well. Taking the case to Japan however would be a different story as Miyazaki's credential far than exceed any marketing technique.In summary though, the whole did not equal to its parts. Aside from Miyazaki's ability to cast vivacious and animated characters, the film lacks elements of thrill and wonder when measured against previous works, resulting in a deficit of big screen presence.The sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke failed to light up the film in a big way but moments of warmth, kindness, and love can still be found in recognizing the film as one that is not made for the kids, but of the kids who everyone is or once was."
14,Ponyo,8,15 October 2008,Gake no Ue no Ponyo,"I have recently watched this film, and have decided to comment on it. the best way to watch this film is to not expect what you have seen in the past by Miyazaki. Miyazaki is well known for his work on on Spirited away and Howl's moving castle. well for western viewers anyway. both of them films were kind of similar to each other but at the same time completely different. However Ponyo is a whole different type of story and animation all together. The story follows ""Ponyo"" a fish that has the face a girl. After Ponyo runs away from her home at the bottom of the sea, she find a whole new world she never knew was out there, and new trouble as well, when she almost caught by a fishing boat, she was rescued by a five year old boy known as Sousuke. the story then follows the two of them and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish. can Ponyo really stay with Sousuke forever ? I feel the movie was inspired by ""The little mermaid"" and at the same time similar to ""Tonari no Totoro"" the movie is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie. But the Characters a fish and a little boy so how much are you expecting to learn about them? the film is set over about what seems to be 3 days, I think this is why the movie is so short. I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope you all enjoy this movie as well"
15,Ponyo,,1 February 2009,"For kids, yes; but more","Knowing full well that this movie is targeting small kids and will therefore not be as thought-provoking as ""Spirited away"", I went to watch it because it is Hayao Miyazaki. In a way, his 2-D, CGI-free screens are even more aesthetically absorbing than 3-D Pixar. The Japanese language version, while more authentic, has the drawback of subtitles vying with the beautiful, detail-rich screen for you attention. But then, Tomoko Yamaguchi's voice is so wonderful as the absolutely adorable mother Lisa.To say that Miyazaki excels in creative imagination is like saying the sun rises in the east. What is so exceptional about this man is that he also gives you, the audience, room for your own imagination. Even a kids' movie like ""Ponyo"" is no exception.In addition to imagination, there is also thought association. While the obvious, declared association is with Anderson's ""Little Mermaid"", there are other associations abound. The menacing ocean echoes Frank Schatzing's Sci-fi thriller ""The swarm"". The rejuvenation process easily brings to mind the wonderful movie ""Cocoon"" (1985). And then, the background music when Ponyo is running on top of towering waves resembles Ride of the Valkries. From a quick glimpse of the subtitle, Ponyo's original name seems to be Brunnhilde (or very close to it) in The Ring Cycle, and she only has sisters. Maybe it's just me, but could there be an Wagnerian subconscious in the movie-making?"
16,Ponyo,1,7 September 2009,Sad how Miyazaki completely misses the mark...,"I'd like to preface my review by mentioning that I've grown up with Miyazaki films; they have colored my childhood and given me the myths and stories that I cherish. That being said, Miyazaki is to me what most Disney films are to most Americans. We have fond memories attached to artifacts from our childhood, and as a result, they command our attention and respect even as we grow into adults.Despite the warm place that Miyazaki's works have in my heart, I was deeply disappointed in PONYO. The art direction and animation was sub-par, lazy, and ultimately rushed. The story had an overly sentimental aspect to it that I feel like earlier Miyazaki films were able to avoid without sacrificing a heartwarming/touching feeling to it. In addition to the sappy ""story"", was there a story? The narrative was all over the place, lacked focus, and I was so sad and surprised to find myself bored and checking my watch 20-minutes into the film! As an example of the simplicity (and not in a good way) of the story, what was with the ""test"" that Ponyo's mother conducts? It's a question of whether Sousuke loves Ponyo? What? He's 5 years old! There are some positive elements of the film, although I was hard-pressed to identify them. First, the opening sequence was absolutely beautiful in its multi-layered presentation. The colors were popping, with a balanced approach to detail and simple shapes that it gave the entire sea world life. Other parts of the animation that were great were Ponyo's Mother's hair, the fish waves, and...that's it. In closing, I'm having a hard time wondering why there are so many glowing reviews. I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion. It seems like many people are so starved for Miyazaki films in the U.S. that they're willing to give glowing reviews to make the film successful in order to keep his films distributed on a wide scale. While I can understand this argument and position, I feel that we should voice our opinions when a work of art is not up to par, and when we know that the artist has it in him to do so much better."
17,Ponyo,9,20 September 2009,Ponyo is very lovable,"Ponyo is a beautiful animated film with some dark undertones. It features a kid-sized story of longing and love with ecological implications, but it is not preachy. Hayao Miyazaki has fused Andersen's Little Mermaid with Japan's native myths and his trademark steam punk flights of fancy, and the result is very rewarding. There are some scary moments of oceanside storms and flooding, but they are thrilling, not horrific.If you've ever wanted to run with the waves along the shore, ride on a jellyfish as an elevator, completely transform yourself, or make a friend for life, Ponyo is a fable for you."
18,Ponyo,9,17 August 2009,"Less memorable and magical than Miyazaki's other films, but still cute and charming.","It has been widely agreed that Hayao Miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters. His movies, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA, and MONONOKE to the recent HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE are all not only gorgeously rendered in terms of art, but in terms of movie-making as well. Can this man do no wrong? Not really, but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star marvels. His newest film, PONYO, an unashamedly family-friendly tale of a ""goldfish out of water"", is as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect... and yet this is the first film of his which treads into ""lesser"" territory. Don't get me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie by any means. As mentioned, it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story doesn't stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing, in-depth plot.For its opening hour, PONYO is Miyazaki storytelling at its finest, in which a rowdy and overeager young goldfish (who later becomes named Ponyo) makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is subsequently adopted by a boy her own age named Sosuke (modeled, interestingly, after the director's own son). This does not please Ponyo's father, a mysterious wizard named Fujimoto, who is very angry at the humans for their destruction of the sea (this environmentalist theme is not much different from Miyazaki's other films)... a problem he very much intends to rectify by creating jellyfish from the prow of his submarine. He separates the pair and tries to talk Ponyo into staying underwater with him. The goldfish, however, has already tasted both Sosuke's blood (healing a cut on his finger) AND some of the human food (ham, which she becomes inexplicably addicted to), and of course steals into her father's forbidden potions, transforming into a hyperactive young girl (who is the spitting image of Mei from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). This triggers a dangerous tsunami which threatens to engulf the entire world with water. Conspiring with his wife, Gran Mamare, a diaphanous sea goddess who alternatingly shifts from super-sized titan to human-size form, Fujimoto decides to test the two youngsters' love for each other. They do this by elevating the sea to the level of Sosuke's house, prompting the youngsters to set out across their now ocean-infested world in an over-sized toy-boat (made possible by Ponyo's own magical powers).It is at this point where PONYO begins to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are adorable and the scenes involving them are funny and cute, they slow down the film. Where the film really takes on water, unfortunately, is at the climax in which Sosuke must prove his love to Ponyo, presented in a way which is strangely anticlimactic and rushed, bringing an otherwise charming tale to an abrupt halt. This will likely underwhelm viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered far more interesting finales for many of his other movies. Remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsuki's search for little Mei? Kiki's rescue of Tombo? Porco Rosso's fight with Curtis? The rescue of the Forest Spirit's head? Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All those resolutions were far more satisfying and felt more complete than this one.On a technical level, PONYO cannot be faulted. The animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at, produced entirely without a single shot of computer-generated-imagery, and naturally Joe Hisaishi provides us with yet another breathtaking musical score; the best moments being the rousing sequences underwater, accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as any other Ghibli movies.Having proved themselves worthy on translating and dubbing Ghibli's previous movies into English with top-quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide an English dub complete with a mostly capable cast of actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke, sounding very natural and believable throughout. Noah Cyrus as Ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes goes overboard in shouting her lines before eventually settling down toward the end. Leads aside, the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson as the overprotective Fujimoto (who manages himself unsurprisingly well in the character), Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare (in an omnipresent tone which is not much different from her Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS), Matt Damon as Sosuke's constantly seafaring father Koichi (who is good but nothing to write home about), and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of them, Fey is the best voice in the entire cast, imbuing the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality. Her scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was spectacular as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY, is disappointingly wasted as one of three handicapped elderly women (she barely has ANY lines!), who are also voiced by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of them, only Tomlin's character, a cantankerous woman named Toki, shows any real personality, but if I were casting the movie, I'd switch Tomlin with Leachman. Probably the only really jarring drawback of the dub is a blasty techno-remix of the film's catchy (but ridiculously repetitive) title song, which thankfully doesn't occur until midway through the closing credits.On the whole, PONYO is a good film; a fine piece of animated work which is perfect for youngsters and family audiences. Due to the loss of momentum toward the end, though, it falls far short of classic status. Since Miyazaki at his least is still better than a majority of other animated films, though, I'll be generous and give PONYO a full star recommendation, because any feature of his is still very much worth watching, particularly on the big screen. (Be sure to catch it in the theaters while you can.)"
19,Ponyo,10,31 May 2009,Hayao Miyazaki's Newest Classic,"I had heard news about this film from anime-legend Hayao Miyazaki, and I SO wanted to see it. But I was lucky enough to the film online at YouTube. After watching the film, I knew that it is another Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli classic.This film, inspired by my favorite fairy-tale ""The Little Mermaid,"" is about a 5-year-old boy named Sosuke, and his relationship with a goldfish princess, whom he named Ponyo, who longs to become human and be with Sosuke. I won't give you anymore details, you'll have to see the film for yourself. So overall, this is one of the best animated movies ever made, with plenty of fantasy, adventure, and humor...I loved it."
20,Ponyo,10,10 October 2012,Doesn't make you feel like a child again; it makes you a child again,"Ponyo is without a doubt one of the loveliest films I've seen. I don't think anyone with a soul can be without smiling at least once during this wonderful piece of work from the hands of animation legend Hayao Miyazaki. There is so much to love about Ponyo.The story bears a vague resemblance to Little Mermaid. The main character, a 5-year old boy named Sosuke, finds a goldfish in a bottle on the beach and decides to name it Ponyo. Through a series of events Ponyo ends up wanting to become human, and then they have a little adventure together. In traditional terms, there hardly is a story: there's no conflict, no main villain, no overall goal to achieve and very little character development. Yet none of this will ever bother, because the visuals, the animation and the pure joy the film absolutely oozes of are so overwhelming they drown out any complaints I might have about the film.That said, the movie really has to have a visual edge if it is to drown out everything else. In that regard Ponyo truly delivers. Everything looks eye-poppingly gorgeous from the water effects to the expressive and instantly distinguishable characters. Most have praised the water effects as the show stealer, but for me it is the animation of the children. Just watching Ponyo run, jump and bounce around with the sheer unbridled joy of a child is a wonder to watch. Look at Sosuke's expressions the first time he hears Ponyo talk: I bet that's exactly how you would have looked like if you'd found as a child that your pet could talk. The audio is also excellent, with thudding sound effects and a riveting musical score that makes even the smallest moments feel meaningful. Ponyo's voice actor is the icing on the cake, giving a performance so adorable it's almost unbearable.But the most effective part of Ponyo is its atmosphere, which is quite hard to describe. In short, Ponyo makes you feel like a child adventuring in the woods again. The seemingly limitless positive energy the film has reminds us of the innocence of childhood, when nothing bad could really happen, because there always was someone looking after you. It's also in the little details: for example, we hardly ever see Sosuke's mother unless he himself is in the same scene. The main conflict is only slightly hinted at, resembling the kind of things only grownups talked about and understood when we were kids.In summation, Ponyo is a fantastic, beautiful work of pure joy that can be enjoyed by any ages. You need to see this film last week."
21,Ponyo,8,8 April 2010,A fine return to form for Studio Ghibli.,"I'm a 24 year old male, and I'm proud to say that Ponyo is one of the cutest and most delightful movies that I've ever seen in my life. I watched the entire movie with a big, silly grin on my face. I needed a good animated experience to remove the mediocrity of Howl's Moving Castle from my brain, and Ponyo more than delivered. It's a simply beautiful movie (which is to be expected), but so was Howl. What makes Ponyo so much better, is that it sticks to a simple story, and tells it very well. This was obviously made so a younger child could easily follow it, but it's equally as captivating for adult viewers.There's no big world-ending disaster to prevent, no dastardly villain to escape, and no heavy-handed moral. There is a very slight message about taking care of the oceans, but that never interferes with the charming little story that's being told. Things never become bigger than the relationship between a 5 year-old boy, and his unusual new friend. And the plot greatly benefits from that narrow focus. If I absolutely must nitpick, the middle of the movie wasn't quiet as marvelous as the excellent beginning and strong ending. Still, I'd recommend this movie to absolutely anyone. If you don't like it, you just don't have a heart."
22,Ponyo,8,6 April 2010,"""Ponyo""","For a select few, the arrival of a new Hayao Miyazaki film is more celebrated than any of Pixar's blockbusters, and with good reason, as each of the renowned Japanese director's traditionally animated features takes upwards of three years to produce. The worlds he depicts are beautiful, teeming with life, color, and spirit, and ""Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea,"" his latest, is no exception.Allegedly Miyazaki's final film, he abandoned even the aid of computers in crafting ""Ponyo,"" each frame being hand drawn and colored by his Studio Ghibli artists, and with stunning results. From its lush island vistas to busy underwater seascapes, the film offers definitive proof to the superiority (or if nothing else, credence for the continuation) of traditional animation.The sweeping elegance of the art renders Miyazaki's films generally unhatable, but the emotional honesty of his characters is what makes them timeless. As a father of two, his knack for exploring the family dynamic from a child's perspective is revelatory. The children lucky enough to live in Miyazaki's imagination exemplify not only what makes real children cute or endearing, but also what makes them stubborn and vulnerable.Enter Sosuke, voiced in the English dub by baby Jonas brother, Frankie, who transcends his gimmicky casting and delivers a warm and compelling performance as ""Ponyo's"" protagonist. Opposite him (fittingly enough) is teenybopper Miley Cyrus' little sister Noah, who does a fine job as well, though is limited mostly to high-pitched sentence fragments like ""Ponyo loves Sosuke!""The two meet on the shore below Sosuke's cliffside home after Ponyo, a princess of the sea, has eluded her father and unwittingly caught herself in a tiny glass jar, from which Sosuke frees her. The plot is more freeform than some of Miyazaki's previous works, but perhaps all the more magic for it. The universe of ""Ponyo"" isn't painstakingly established, and the supernatural and the incredible routinely go unquestioned, existing in an alternate plane of reality which keeps the film feeling spontaneous and often wonderful.If ""Ponyo"" does prove to be Miyazaki's last film, it could potentially suffer from ""Eyes Wide Shut"" syndrome, symptoms of which include unfair comparisons to its director's previous work and microscope-level nitpicking, which is entirely undeserved. The film is not his career-redefining masterwork, nor is it in any way unworthy of the legacy that preceded it. It's objectively, independently great. ""Ponyo"" has a simple beauty to it that rivals that of ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" and fantasy sequences that recall the best of ""Spirited Away.""For its great cast (Tina Fey, Matt Damon Cate Blanchett, and Liam Neeson comprise a great dub, however blasphemous that may sound to Miyazaki purists), easy-going earnestness, and beautifully inventive visuals, ""Ponyo"" is my pick for animated film of the year, 'up- setting' Pixar's 2009 heavyweight, which had emotion to spare but came up short in adventure.But those select few will share my disappointment when the envelope is opened and the monosyllabic winner is read on Oscar night. Miyazaki's latest is worthwhile even for those who associate Japanese animated films with stuffy conventions and overweight teens in costumes. ""Ponyo"" is a modern family classic on par with ""The Little Mermaid"" and the rest of the Disney golden-era library.Miyazaki is a magician, and like a magician, everything he shows you isn't essential to your comprehension of the trick, but the end result is so beautiful that there's no sense in questioning it."
23,Ponyo,8,7 July 2009,Fish be with you,"Like the 5-year old protagonists of his latest opus, Hayao Miyazaki's ""Ponyo"" enchants with its unbridled innocence as though the anime-meister has become a child himself in weaving a narrative that relishes in its simplicity and emits an infectious charm in the process. Miyazaki, recalling his earlier works, paints a brightly-colored world obviously geared for the younger audiences and the raw effervescence gleefully strips off the grim thematic elements that distinguish its immediate predecessors.Ponyo (voiced lovably by Yuria Nara), a fish with a young girl's face (making her look like a cuddly child in a pink overgrown Halloween costume), escapes away from her underwater home and her school of siblings to explore the surface. Stranded ashore, she is rescued by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a five-year old boy who, along with his mom Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi), resides in a house on the nearby cliff. This initial encounter and, eventually, friendship, has a profound effect on Ponyo who now wishes to become human, but by becoming so inadvertently tips nature's balance and unleashes a maelstrom on land. With Sosuke's help, Ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a human.Despite the plot lacking the philosophical sophistication of, say, his most recent ""Spirited Away,"" ""Ponyo"" is nothing short of an astounding follow-up, characterized by the extremely diligent attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and the fantastic, and of the simple joys and great fears. It's a straightforward tale that, though at times stalled by its tendency to ramble like a toddler, keeps in tune with its youthful pedigree to magically enthrall. ""I will protect you,"" Sosuke tells Ponyo matter-of-factly, a childlike assertion not unlike the manner in which Miyazaki endows his story with artful spirit."
24,Ponyo,8,2 July 2009,"A Miyazaki classic geared towards a much, much younger audience","I have been reading a lot of different opinions and reviews of this movie, and I understand why a lot of people get mixed feelings about Ponyo, whether it be the story line, animation, dialogue, and so forth. And I believe the most simple way I can answer to this, is that it's a movie for a much, much younger age bracket. An age bracket much younger than that of Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro).Being a Miyazaki fan like the majority of the surfers on this site, I expected the wonderful animation, music composition, complex story telling, the great steady development of characters, how the story intertwines with today's society, etc etc etc of a typical Miyazaki film that we grew up with. And to tell you the truth, I didn't quite understand what the hell this story was supposed to be about or what the hell was going on until an hour and twenty minutes (with twenty minutes left in the movie), that this movie is NOT for the deep thinkers and hard core Ghibli-ists, but for the toddlers and youngins' and happy go lucky Japanese people. Also, I believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation; straight-up grass roots Ghibli Studios style. The fact that a villain is not present really surprised me, other than the father and maybe that crazy-ass typhoon. But other than that, this movie is just plain fun; to stimulate a young one's mind, and to make happy good time feeling. That's all. The animation goes back to the old-school mid-80s early-90s era of Miyazaki's films, where very specific detail wasn't a big focus, unlike Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) and the latter. I admire the simplicity which kind of created some small nostalgia when I first watched Ghibli movies like Tonarino Totoro when I was a child. The reaction and movement of the children are all very similar to that of kids, and a lot of Studio Ghibli's body language is very noticeable. Studio Ghibli added some creative moments and sceneries that they can only do with it's wonderful animators, but it probably won't take the ritual Ghibli-ist in awe.The Japanese dialogue also sounded very child friendly and a lot of scenes and dialogues are very, very relative from what Japanese kids and mothers would say and act. The music if very hoppy and ""fluffy"" I guess you could say (similar to Totoro) from beginning to end. Even the darker scenes didn't seem assertive.In the end this movie is one of a kind. Just about every aspect of this movie is for children. And I waited a whole 80 mins to realize that. Quite frankly, I have never seen a movie told or shown it the way Miyazaki did. It's refreshing to see that Studio Ghibli can still tell a story for a wider, and much different scale of audience, and still keep that trademark Ghibli impression."
25,Ponyo,10,23 August 2008,beautiful scene and beautiful souls!,"well, yet another Miyazaki's classic! like Spirited Away, like Mononoki Hime, like Totoro! Brought me back to my childhood, to the other world! -- Risa's a good mum, just like my mum - and coincidentally, I call my mum by her name. A good mum I perceive, gives the child the space and the freedom for what he/she wants. And watching the film, I felt that I'd like to be become Risa, being brave in any situation, and trusts his child - and most importantly, like everybody else, are truly kind to others, even the old lady who stood out at the beginning; even Ponyo's father! He was influenced and became good eventually and I was glad to see that.The romanticism between the red/fish and the human is the theme I suppose! Don't ever give up - the message I got, well I suppose! from what I saw about them supporting each other.After the disappointments of 'Howl's moving castle' and 'Tale from the Earth Sea', 'Gake no ue no Ponyo' rebuilt my confidence about Miyazaki's films, which brings surrealism and beautifulness to a realistic level! And the resemblance between Ponyo and Mei (in Totoro) ..."
26,Ponyo,2,26 July 2010,Miyazaki's Retirement Fund Film,"I am a fan of Miyazaki's work from ""Nausicaä"" to ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" and I cannot believe that ""Ponyo"" is his own work, but that is not a good thing. Let's get my main qualm out of the way: The film's story (or lack thereof) is a take on ""The Little Mermaid,"" but with no antagonist. Yes, you read that right, there is NO VILLAIN whatsoever, thus providing next to no conflict between the two sects of characters (humans and humanoid fish), or the two young leads. There are also so many plot points that are unexplained, like Ponyo's inexplicable transformations and reversions, and her ability to make a toy boat grow and function normally. Furthermore, the film doesn't ""translate,"" so to speak, to American audiences, as the key plot point is that the two lead characters, Ponyo and Sosuke, must (I kid you not) fall in love, or the moon will collide into the earth (Yes, Miyazaki just might have ripped off of ""The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask""). The problem with this, is that Ponyo and Sosuke are five years old. As an American with a great appreciation for foreign countries, childhood romance is cute, but it seems fairly weird when taken to that level. Sure, it's very much a part of Japanese culture to start romance off that early, but it just doesn't click with US audiences. I don't find it ""creepy,"" I just find it weird that Miyazaki seemingly doesn't take foreign markets into consideration; especially since Studio Ghibli has a deal with Disney to dub and release these films. And speaking of, let's talk about the dub. I dislike the use of Disney Channel kiddos in these dubs (in this case, siblings of), but Noah Lindsay Cyrus and Frankie Jonas do just fine as Ponyo and Sosuke, with Cyrus truly embracing Ponyo's excitement and happiness, and Jonas evoking childlike wonder and emotion. Tiny Fey does very well as Sosuke's caring (but temperamental) mother, which is a nice turn from her fairly snarky side in ""30 Rock."" I'd like to see more of Fey in roles like this. Matt Damon takes a thankless, ""read-and-done"" role as Sosuke's seafaring father. However, for what little time he has in the film, he does much better than his incredibly wooden voice acting in ""Titan A.E.."" Liam Neeson plays Fujimoto; Ponyo's water-dwelling father. Though he adds a touch of eccentricity, Neeson does his usual vocal shtick that is continually reminiscent of his character in the ""Star Wars"" prequels. Cate Blanchett plays Grandmere, the goddess of the sea and mother of Ponyo. Like Damon, her role is hardly there, and when she is speaking, it's hardly with any effort. Betty White, Cloris Leachman, and Lily Tomlin play three old ladies in the retirement home where Sosuke's mom works. They do just fine; what else can be said? Of course, this being an animated film, the visuals must be the saving grace, right? Well, yes and no. The animation ranges from balanced, peaceful and cute to bright (mostly in the ""on land"" scenes), to invasive and eyesore-inducing (mostly in the ""sea"" scenes), making an uneven viewing experience for just about anyone. In closing, there is not much I can say in ""Ponyo""'s benefit. It's well acted, but the incredibly dead story and continually varying visuals make this film a definite skip. Wait for ""Tales from Earthsea,"" or even ""The Borrowers"" for a potentially better Ghibli film."
27,Ponyo,9,12 August 2008,"Great movie, but many Japanese might be confused by its openness","A great movie. A very ""oriental"" movie.Now this famous Japanese animation filmmaker doesn't seem interested in so called rational world. People mentioned that animism was seen a lot in the film ""Spirited Away"", another big hit from the director in 2002. This time he went even beyond.This story is so open, unlike the majority of the hit movies these days, that many of the audience seem to be lost in the maze to the goal, which is typically a good lesson. The story with the main character being a fish and wanting to become a human, and the parent of the fish girl trying to stop her and eventually causing a big tsunami sweeping away the whole village is probably very oriental and mythical.However, this is not how we perceive the world these days, even in Japan. Many of the hit movies are from the US, having ""closed"" plots where the main characters usually return to the starting place with some reward back. Additionally Japanese people recently tend to try and share common perceptions of things, remarked by the phrase ""kuki yomu"" meaning ""sense the air"". That, I think, makes them confused with this film. I don't think Japanese people these days are good at enjoying interpreting art works without caring what other people think too much.This movie can be your playground, or a party without invitation. That is why, I think that we will have to wait for the overseas critics' reviews before we really set the reputation of the film. Also I am very interested in how people in other Asian countries will like the movie."
28,Ponyo,2,22 August 2009,I just don't get the hype,"The glowing reviews of this movie as a wonderful experience for all ages baffles me. I found it a muddled, slow-paced film that lulled my family to the edge of slumber. Don't bother to follow the plot as most of the story threads in the movie lead to nowhere. The film attempts to run with an environmental message in the beginning but it is soon drowned in a weird a supernatural underwater world that never seems to make sense. There's even a Cocoon-like subplot but nothing comes of it.I never cared for the lead character, Ponyo, who looks like a creepy fetus. Unlike E.T., Wally or the young Simba, Ponyo is borderline retarded with no personality whatsoever.Unless you are a Anime nut with a sleep disorder, avoid this film!"
29,Ponyo,10,5 January 2009,This is very nice movie!,My favorite movie is Miyazaki's films. He is intelligent. I enjoyed this movie. This movie is very interesting. I want to watch again. This movie made me laugh and cry. I like characters. Ponyo looks like Mei. Mei is Totoro's character. She is cute. Sosuke is brave. He looks after Ponyo. His parents are very good. His father loves family. His mother is very strong and powerful. She works to help old people. Old people are very kind. Ponyo's mother is beautiful. Her father is funny. This movie song is good. This song is sung by Nozomi Ohashi. It was a big hit in Japan. I watched this movie many times. Each time was fun. Everyone of all ages can enjoy this movie!
30,Ponyo,10,12 June 2010,Vey good film,"For someone who counts themselves as a pretty serious fan of Studio Ghibli it sure has taken me a while to watch their newest film. Still, it's always nice for that wait to pay off with another wonderful viewing experience. Picking up from their last feature, Tales of Earthsea, which was perhaps the weakest in the studio's career although it is pretty good.The story of ""Ponyo"" follows a young fish, with a human face, named Ponyo (Brunhilde originally) who wishes very much to be a human. Her father is Fukimoto, a wizard who lives under the sea and strives to create powerful elixirs that will restore the oceans to their richness in the prehistoric Devonian Era. Miyazaki's usual elements of environmental awareness are intact as much is made of man's impact on the quality of life under the waves. Fujimoto has no love of humans and keeps his children, of whom Ponyo would seem the eldest, in captivity in a bubble to prevent them from mixing with this world. Fujimoto was once a human himself but turned his back on it apparently beginning a romantic tryst with Gran Mamare (alternately known as the Goddess of Mercy) which produced these offspring. The film sees little point in exploring this detail and the story centers on Ponyo's relationship with a little boy named Sosuke and his mother, Lisa. Sosuke is five years old and lives in a house located on a steep cliff by a harbor. His father captains a ship and is gone for long periods while his young mother works at a nearby nursing home. One day Sosuke happens upon Ponyo who, while escaping from Fujumoto, becomes trapped in a bottle. Breaking the bottle Sosuke cuts himself and Ponyo licks the wound which both heals it and also sets in motion a chain of magical events that allow Ponyo to realize her dream of becoming fully human. Miyazaki explicitly states that Disney's The Little Mermaid was a prime influence on this film and so the narrative frame comes as little surprise (Hans Christian Andersen also deserves a nod). In any case, events spiral out of control as Ponyo's actions unleash all of Fukimoto's elixirs into the waters and every one must band together to try and work things out.The core of Ponyo is the interplay between the main characters. What has always defined Ghibli apart from many other big players in animation is that they see fit to use the medium to explore the more mundane alongside the magical. It's hard for me to ascertain just how good Ponyo is when ranked against the other works of Ghibli. There's simply an abundance to enjoy here and I'll admit, as an avid dinosaur fan when I was a young boy, the sight of so many prehistoric fish and monsters in the waters came as familiar memories to me which only furthers my affection. Like all things Miyazaki it's surely impossible not to get swept up in this world of positive sentiment that shows that even when things get bad it's the bonds between us all that will help us work things out. I'm simply smitten by this film, a state that rarely occurs unless I'm indulging either in Miyazaki or Ozu. Familiar themes and images, ideas and realizations all flow from one film to the next and, rather than becoming banal or ordinary, they strengthen and reinforce themselves to further both men's affection for our world. If there's anything particularly unusual about Ponyo it's perhaps the seeming lack of major conflict throughout the story. Miyazaki has rarely had time for outright villains (he will indulge in heroes, but they are simply us) but the stakes certainly have been set higher in previous films. One can simply call to mind the fevered warfare of his masterpiece Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds or Chihiro's quest to rescue her parents in Spirited Away. In that sense Ponyo is more similar to My Neighbour Totoro in that its primary interest is in recapturing and rekindling the simple wonderment of children. It's not as uncluttered, simple and thus affecting as that film but it certainly stands in its own right nonetheless. Throughout the film seeming tragedies, such as the unleashing of the elixirs, and potential showdowns, such as Fujimoto's attempts to rescue Ponyo from Sosuke, lead not to dynamic conflict but instead to new platforms of understanding that fuel later events in the narrative. At some stage we might want to wonder how it came to pass those depictions of the world at large as helpful, beautiful and built on simple community became a genuine rarity in film. In the meantime Miyazaki is here to show us this path; of conflict and disparate interests that are solved not through grand action but instead through simple communication.""Ponyo"" it's a great film, just like any of the other movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki."
31,Ponyo,7,18 August 2009,"Miyazaki uses his wild imagination to enchant families with ""Ponyo""","Hayao Miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe, and his most recent cinematic work of art is ""Ponyo,"" a children's fairytale borrowing on story elements from The Little Mermaid. Of course like other Miyazaki classics such as ""Spirited Away"" and his last film, ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" ""Ponyo"" is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults, but this it is distinctly more a children's story than those recent efforts. It's a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable, aiming for charm instead of conflict.""Ponyo"" is the story of a bug-eyed childish-looking fish of the same name, the daughter of an undersea sorcerer, who longs to escape the sea and become a little girl. When she does, she quickly befriends a young boy named Sosuke. In the process she gains a strong magic and unknowingly throws the world out of balance between land and sea, and a giant storm drowns most of the cliff-top town where Sosuke lives with his mother, and it threatens to end the world.Like ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" Walt Disney picked up ""Ponyo"" for an American release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of Western voices, even choosing homegrown products in the youngest siblings of Disney band the Jonas Brothers (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (younger sister Noah) to voice Sosuke and Ponyo, respectively. Also voicing characters are Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, Ponyo's father), Tina Fey (Lisa, Sosuke's mother), Matt Damon (Sosuke's father), Cate Blanchett (Ponyo's sea goddess mother) and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by Betty White, Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to American audiences and Disney is getting close.But voices are of little significance in a Miyazaki film, which is all about visual creativity. A fan of transformations and animating liquid and fluid motion, creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater must've been a joy for Miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story. Among the highlights are droplets of water that Fujimoto sends after Ponyo that move like living waves, as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make ""Ponyo"" as awing as any other Miyazaki film.As a children's story, however, ""Ponyo"" concentrates its efforts on being adorable. The discovery of true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is heart-warming, even if Noah Cyrus shouting childishly when Ponyo excitedly embraces human life can get a bit annoying. But as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are, there's very little antagonism or danger. Past Miyazaki films have clear villains, but the conflict in ""Ponyo"" actually shrinks as the story goes along. Sosuke believes he's lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of whack and that humans should be ashamed of polluting the sea, but ""Ponyo"" is mostly tension free. Most glaringly, its climax is uneventful despite how overall likable all the characters are.""Ponyo"" will surely satisfy Miyazaki's fans in every way with its imagination, and newcomers will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling, but this is distinctly more of a children's movie, best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience. It's not quite what you'd expect from Miyazaki considering his recent work, but it's sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"
32,Ponyo,10,14 August 2009,Pure Enchantment!,"It's rare for a film to sweep you away within its world and leave you wanting more once the credits roll. Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is such a film.The film is the story of a young goldfish named Ponyo who wishes to become human. She swims to shore and is found by a young boy named Sasuke who promises to take care of her. Of course Ponyo's father, an ecologically obsessed sorcerer named Fujimoto, tries to keep Ponyo from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature, which is eventually upturned when Ponyo finally transforms into a little girl, causing a massive typhoon.Ponyo is a very rich film. It is full of wondrous fantasy, lovable characters, and genuine heart. What director Hayao Miyazaki has done here is tell a simple little story, and in the process, has created authentic movie magic.Ponyo is an enchanting experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. As well the environmentalist within Miyazaki is still as evident within this film as in all his previous works. Miyazaki shows the filth and grime that fall into the ocean in an almost startling light, not to mention Ponyo's father is on an obsessive mission to clean the world's oceans. While the story is simple, Miyazaki manages to add this extra layer to provoke thought with expert proficiency.The film is a beautiful work of art, each hand drawn cell looks like a wondrous pastel painting. The film looks very different than many other Studio Ghibli productions, but the artistry is still just as spectacular as ever before. The scenes underwater are simply beautiful to watch, Fujimoto's fortress under the sea is highly inventive, and the sequence where Ponyo runs across the jumping fish within the typhoon is iconic. Of course it is thanks to the wonderfully executed characters that makes this film such a memorable experience. Sasuke is a young boy who acts older than he actually is, and the energetic Ponyo is a laugh a minute. Every character is just so enjoyable and highly memorable.Overall, Ponyo is a wondrous experience, enchanting in every single way. While the film may be sold as a children's fairy tale, I believe many adults will be swept away within its fantastic world along with their children. While the film may lack the density of some of Miyazaki's previous works, here he keeps it pure and simple, being true to himself, delivering a film that is funny, heartwarming, and entertaining all in one. This is a magnificent film.I give Ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10!"
33,Ponyo,10,15 August 2009,Miyazaki's magic never dwindles...,"Obviously, Ponyo can be seen as just not another stupid animated movie that a studio might put out to simply survive. It is far from it, and it can be easily described as a captivating, beautiful movie experience.Miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece. Now, to many, this has been said to be the least of his achievements in film-making, due to in part of his ""certain weirdness factor"" not being there. That is true-the morals and insights that are not quite so evident in his previous films are very up front in this picture. Ponyo is not too difficult to understand or comprehend. His idea, I believe, was to make a children's movie that was just as suitable for adults as their kids, and for it not to be too complicated. He accomplished this perfectly, and he also didn't lose any substance along the way, which is the reason it gets a 10.Besides that, the film itself is so engrossing from the start, and the way its presented is so beautiful, it left me in awe at times because I remembered how they were all hand-drawn by Miyazaki himself. I haven't been so enlightened and happy after seeing a film since I saw Once a while back (another film not to be missed). Everything about Ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking; even the music for it was pure perfection. The only bad thing I have to say about it was its English dubbing. Don't get me wrong, they were good, too, but I had seen Ponyo about 2 weeks before it came out nationally, and I believed that, in some parts, I wish it had kept some of its Japanese dialogue (not all of it, though; did enjoy the ""English way"" too). All in all, everyone should see Ponyo; it's absolutely flawless and in another league of film-making altogether. Finally, and don't hold me to this, but I wouldn't be surprised if Ponyo got a Best Picture nomination, as there are now 10 films that can be nominated for it. It's just that good."
34,Ponyo,5,14 August 2009,Ponyo Movie Review from The Massie Twins,"The works of Hayao Miyazaki are always populated by unique characters and unbridled creativity in fantastically magical worlds. Ponyo is no different. However, where his other films like Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle play upon more adult themes and oftentimes truly terrifying villains, Ponyo remains very safely in the realm of whimsical childhood adventure, and sadly abandons the heavy adversity found in previous efforts. Still mildly entertaining, gorgeously picturesque, and wonderfully perceptive to the subtleties of childish innocence that evoke poignant humor, Ponyo clearly targets a very young audience.The son of a sailor, 5-year old Sosuke lives a quiet life on an oceanside cliff with his mother Lisa (Tina Fey). One fateful day, he finds a beautiful goldfish trapped in a bottle on the beach and upon rescuing her, names her Ponyo. But she is no ordinary goldfish. The daughter of a masterful wizard (Liam Neeson) and a sea goddess (Cate Blanchett), Ponyo uses her father's magic to transform herself into a young girl and quickly falls in love with Sosuke; but the use of such powerful sorcery causes a dangerous imbalance in the world. As the moon steadily draws nearer to the earth and Ponyo's father sends the ocean's mighty waves to find his daughter, the two children embark on an adventure of a lifetime to save the world and fulfill Ponyo's dreams of becoming human.Ponyo proves once again that it's very difficult to base a movie around a child main character. And considering the lead is five years old, legendary animation director Miyazaki must overcome an especially large obstacle. Unfortunately he is unable to infuse any reasoning into this imaginative but empty fantasy. Sosuke is given the largest challenge of his life and the formidable task of restoring balance to the universe when a hole in the fabric of reality is opened. Conveniently, he never actually has to deal with difficult trials, tests of his capability or proof of his love for Ponyo. Since he is only five years old, it would be a particular nuisance to demonstrate love as anything beyond a simple spoken phrase.The biggest problem with the film is the lack of any real conflict. Granted that it's targeting a notably young audience, but Ponyo plays out as little more than a series of events that progressively get weirder as Miyazaki starts to explore the supernatural and unusual fantasy - all without explanations or a basis in popular mythology. Never does believable danger creep into the picture, nor a frightening villain or emotional tribulations. It seems unnecessary to include a single skeptical character (Toki, voiced by Lily Tomlin) for a timid dose of realism, one who actually questions the phenomena taking place - and she's presented as a crotchety old wretch.At least the animation during the numerous underwater sequences is complex, creative and visually stunning. Apparently so much effort was contributed to these scenes that the human animation is startlingly simple and occasionally ugly. The best part of Ponyo is the music, movingly presiding over the grandest tsunami moments and causing milder segments to briefly become more stirring. Ultimately Ponyo is designed for the smallest of children - what it won't teach them is to avoid talking to elderly strangers with wild orange hair and candy-cane-striped suits who emerge from the sea.The Massie Twins"
35,Ponyo,10,16 August 2009,Remarkably beautiful,"Perhaps not Miyazaki's best work, but I couldn't help but love it to death. A five-year old boy finds what he thinks is a goldfish stuck in a bottle. He saves its life and keeps it in a bucket as a pet, but it really is a magical being, the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess. Ponyo, as the boy names her, is taken back to the sea by her father, who tries to discourage her from returning to land and becoming human, but she gets into his magic elixirs and does what she wants to do. The story is simple and cute. Where the film really comes alive, though, is in its tremendous artwork. The drawings are more child-like than in any of Miyazaki's other works, but there's beauty in its simplicity. As with all of his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination that I was just so in awe of. Seeing it in the theater brought back memories of what it was like when the opening notes of Jo Hisaishi's score for Princess Mononoke washed over me and gave me goosebumps just short of a decade ago (the score here is equally as wonderful). I wanted to live in this world and never leave it."
36,Ponyo,10,16 January 2009,I absolutely loved it.,"I absolutely, positively loved the movie. I just saw it and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. It is a beautifully, well-drawn masterpiece. I am always amazed with the intricately drawn work of Ghibli studios. Others have commented on Sosuke calling Risa by her first name. He never calls his Father by his first name unless he is speaking about him to someone else. I didn't get the impression that Risa was his mother. It was never even mentioned or implied by anyone. It is quite obvious that she is his step-mother. That is why he makes her promise to come home and why he gets so upset when he finds her empty car. His mother must have died when he was an infant because he mentions being nursed by Risa. This coupled with his father being out to sea a lot is why he has abandonment issues. Everyone also talks about how mature he is. This usually occurs when a child loses a parent."
37,Ponyo,6,6 September 2009,Ghibli is slipping...,"I saw Ponyo today & was quite disappointed. I think if you're an animation lover & a fan of Miyazaki's films such as Spirited Away & Princess Mononoke you'll probably react to the same things that I did.I hated the music. It was overused & Joe Hisaishi seems to be going further & further away from the simple, minimalist tunes that make his work on Miyazaki's earlier films so unique & identifiable. It was far too orchestral & generic.The animation quality varied a lot. There are a few moments of TV grade crappy animation which I never thought I'd see in any Miyazaki film such were his high standards. But having said that there are many more breathtakingly beautiful & detailed sequences than bad ones.The colouring. Very flat single tone colouring most of the time. No shading makes the animation look very old school & cheapens the good work that's obviously been put in making (most of) it move so nicely.The backgrounds. Very sketchy. Not the gorgeously detailed painted landscapes & buildings from Spirited Away that you could easily imagine hanging up in a fine art gallery. The art in Ponyo is more like basic children's storybook pictures.This trend towards simplifying the animation bothers me a bit. I saw Goro Miyazaki's Tales From Earthsea & absolutely hated it. More for the crap story & film-making than the look of the animation, but I did notice that the art was far less detailed than previous Ghibli efforts.And now Hayao Miyazaki, the master, delivers a film that also does not live up to the standards previously set. This may have been a stylistic decision, but now with a couple of lower quality films released I wonder if this is what we can keep expecting to see from Ghibli. I hope not! I'm an animation fan & I love to see new work that pushes the envelope. Ponyo didn't. The version I saw had the English dub & had Disney plastered all over it. And it may as well have been a Disney production too. As an adult, artistically & storywise there was nowhere near as much enjoyment to be had out of Ponyo as with Miyazaki's other films.However, there were many young children in the cinema & they really got into it. It's a very simple story, very cutesy & no scary scenes at all. Your kids will love it, even if you don't!"
38,Ponyo,5,19 April 2012,"Not my best experience of Studio Ghibli...,","I know that this Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki's reworking of The Little Mermaid is very popular and that I'm probably going to be unpopular for saying this, but as an adult, watching without any youngsters, this wasn't for me.The animation is beautifully done and the environmental message and tone commendable. What however damages it for me, or at least the version I saw on Film 4, was the American vocalised one. I always have a bit of a problem with any foreign language film dubbed, or re-spoken into American-English. Everything grates and the characters integrity are diminished because you know they're, in this case, Japanese children and they'd be speaking their native tongue.A petty point, maybe, not one that I'd only award one or two stars for, so a middling three."
39,Ponyo,10,17 June 2011,The Oscars Lie and magnificent Ponyo,"I'm sorry (though not really) but Wall-E is a sappy love story of approximately 9-year olds in love. A good idea with dull characters and so-so visuals and a huge deficit of imagination. It won the Oscar for 2008. Pixar's Up was superb for the first half an hour but after that was a complete mess, a crass nonsense. That one got the Oscar for 2009! Ponyo was NOT EVEN NOMINATED! Ponyo is by far the superior to both, the superior by a country mile. Ponyo is a marvelously imaginative tale of a daughter of the sea found by a boy. There are many ways to watch it. One is to look all over each frame for the wonderful incidental details. The imagination, vision and visuals are, at times, breathtaking. Again, as with his other films, the environment and caring for it, is extolled. Amazing that the films carry this stringent message without in any way compromising the animation. And he has been doing so in film since all the way back in '84 with the equally great Nausicaa and the Valley of the Winds. If there is such a thing as magic it is in the work of Miyazaki. A corrupt Academy Awards denied it the acclaim is so very richly deserves."
40,Ponyo,8,27 April 2010,Magical in it's own way,"After viewing such masterpieces as Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, I had been wanting to see Ponyo ever since I saw the first theatrical trailer. I think Miyazaki is an amazingly brilliant and incredibly imaginative director and writer, so I am now, and have been, on a Miyazaki quest and plan to complete it. Ponyo does not disappoint and is another gem in Miyazaki's astounding résumé.It is a visually amazing and beautiful film from start to finish. I mean, the colors and animation were just extravagant; picturesque, luscious, out of this world scenes and vibrant, unbelievable yet simplistic looking animation all the way through are what make this film so outstandingly mesmerizing. Undeniably breathtaking and lovely from the minute it comes on screen, Ponyo is a very entertaining, children's' love story that is done right for once. It's vivid and resplendent in story line, characters and animation while being so incredibly interesting and fun that you can't help but smile at all the magical, sweet antics and fall in love with the plot and characters' personalities.As I just said, the characters were so lovable, as well. It's a bit more childish than I expected, but here again it's compellingly brilliant all the same. Miyazaki just has a way at taking animations and twisting them into euphoric, miraculous adventures of wonder and splendor and giving his characters such incredible, fun and lovable traits that you are gleaming with interest as soon as the come on screen. The movie leaves you wanting more, but so do all of Miyazaki's films and of course I mean that in the best way possible. Ponyo is crazy, creative and clever, and I just can't help but find myself wanting to watch it over and over again in the same night, as I did other Miyazaki works of art like Howl's Moving Castle.All in all, if you enjoy Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli this is a hit you just can't miss for it is excellent and filled to the brim with bliss and enchantment. Well done again Mr. Miyazaki, well done indeed."
41,Ponyo,9,9 April 2010,Exuberant Innocence,"sometimes i think Miyazaki makes even Disney seem hard and cynical. there is so much innocence and true wonder for the world that you would think only a child could see. but Miyazaki sees that world and gets us all to see it.it's not that Miyazaki isn't weird. in fact his films can be pretty bizarre. even scary like 'Spirited Away'. but there is always that wide eyed sense of wonderment that really makes you feel like a little kid again.i didn't really think Ponyo looked like a goldfish though. and goldfish don't live in the sea they're fresh water aren't they? oh who cares. Miyazaki makes you not give a damn. besides, i get tired of all the forced realism in Disney animation and in cruddy CGI stuff anyhow. Ponyo is just pure unbridled imagination."
42,Ponyo,10,2 March 2010,"""Ponyo"" - More fun from under the sea","Now I seriously wish more animation could be like Hayao Miyazaki's new Anime' (Japanese animation) film, ""Ponyo."" In an age where most animation (American and Japanese) is so highly sophisticated and overdone with CGI and special effects, Miyazaki's ""Ponyo,"" on the other hand, revels in its hand-drawn simplicity and epic fairy tale storytelling dynamics that easily brings back memories of better, simpler times.Miyazaki's films in recent years - since roughly the beginning of the 21st century - have avoided taking on the current trend to mix their hand-drawn animation with CGI and special effects magic (and if they have, he does a damn good job of concealing their use or making them less obvious), and I make it a point to place his films in a much higher regard than many of his contemporaries in Japan and the United States. (His ""Spirited Away"" in 2002 happens to be my favorite animated movie of all time, American, Japanese, or otherwise.)The story of ""Ponyo"" is something straight out of a children's fairy tale: 5-year-old Sosuke (voice of Frankie Jonas, younger brother of the musical Jonases) is a young boy who was playing by the ocean one day when he manages to rescue Ponyo (Noah Cyrus, Miley Cyrus's younger sister), a rebellious young goldfish who had just escaped from her father Fujimoto's (Liam Neeson), the god of the sea, underwater kingdom. As would be expected, it's love at first sight between Sosuke and Ponyo (but since this is a family film, there's no kissing). Ponyo manages to adopt a human form as a little girl about Sosuke's age so that she could live on land, but in the process, however, setting off a chain of events that have upset the delicate balance of nature, a change that may have grave consequences for both humanity and the world below.""Ponyo"" is an amazingly spirited animated fantasy-adventure about the power of love and friendship in the unlikeliest of places, from one of the unlikeliest of places. While I doubt that this is the sort of movie American children will seriously latch on to in the same way they probably did ""Up"" (2009) last year, you should trust me when I say that this is a movie they wouldn't want to miss either. The adults in the audience will definitely find something to like about the film's adults, from Fujimoto's devoted father to Sosuke's loving mother Lisa (Tina Fey), who are both given full screen time, are real and honest, and are not reduced to mere antagonistic or barely-there supporting roles. And even though you get the idea that Fujimoto is this film's villain, he's really not such a bad guy; he's just a doting and concerned father who obviously loves his daughter and wants to keep her away from harm and danger, although he is aware that her actions can have grave consequences for both his undersea kingdom and the rest of humanity.The story and animation soared beyond my wildest dreams and expectations about what ""Ponyo"" could do in either respect. That the movie can still find an audience in an era dominated by CGI and special effects, says something about the power of Miyazaki's more-traditional animating style. It's simple but beautiful and fantastic to look at; I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The driving and emotional soundtrack score by longtime Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi is something to marvel at as well. I had to order the soundtrack imported from Amazon.com and was quite surprised to learn that it did not include the remixed theme songs recorded by Noah Cyrus and Frankie Jonas for the film's American release (which actually aren't that bad, and I'm not in any way a fan of either artist).""Ponyo"" is a great an all-around fantastic little film. It's certainly one of Miyazaki's best films, and with a really great feel-good ending that just warms your little heart inside.10/10"
43,Ponyo,10,19 September 2009,崖の上のポニョ: Yet another Hayao Miyazaki wonderful gem,"The animation presented in 崖の上のポニョ (aka: Ponyo) is what I would call perfection, old- fashioned animation, no CGI, just pure beauty. I would say this, the latest production of the father of Pixar Hayao Miyazaki, is more in the vein of My Neighbor Totoro than in the vein of Spirited Away. This ain't as spectacular as Spirited Away, I mean it is spectacular but in a different way. And it is like an ode to the human kind, the good side of the human kind: we have a man that once, long time ago lived like all the humans but that now lives under the sea. Apparently he really hates humans now but his eldest daughter, a fish with human head, will go to the surface only to start her big love for the humans, in specific for Sōsuke, a 5-year-old kid. Why? Well simply because the kid, sort of representing the very best side of the human race, helped her when she was almost dead, protected her, showed a real appreciation for her and gave her a new name that for her is much more nicer than her first and real name. Now her name is Ponyo and when she is back to the place where she belongs she still wants to be Ponyo and also she wants legs and arms like the ones of Sōsuke! She saw the enough of the humans to have the desire to become one and boy is she's going to change!It's said that one of the recurrent themes in the films of Miyazaki (for the record I have only seen so far, aside of Ponyo of course, The Castle of Cagliostro, My Neighbor Totoro, Porco Rosso and Spirited Away. Here I promise to myself that during the following week I will finally see Howl's Moving Castle, which I own on DVD since more than year ago! But I know it's also playing at the Cineteca, in Mexico City, tomorrow morning and also next week so maybe I will be seeing it on the big screen!) is the one of the power of love. In Ponyo we have the subject of appearances, there's nothing that changes between both Sōsuke and Ponyo once Ponyo returns to the surface with legs and hands, there are no questions from Sōsuke once he is a hundred percent sure that Ponyo is back. The film is extremely charming and the part with Ponyo being introduced to some human habits stands out there's no way you will not love her as there's no way she cannot fall in love with the warm of the home of Sōsuke (the mother of Sōsuke is also quite a strong woman, and one hell of a driver!). But of course not everything is quite fantastic, I mean not quite fantastic for the world of the film since for us basically every minute of the film is more than just fantastic. Ponyo will bring more to the surface than just her lovely presence (the appearance of Ponyo's mother is simply mesmerizing animation) but again is the power of love the solution of everything, first with them Sōsuke and Ponyo trying to find Sōsuke's mother (it's another part full of charm: the toy boat, Ponyo a bit angry with the mother of a baby, all the fishes, the hat turned miniature but also Ponyo changing of form again, she's the fish again) and finally with the confirmation of what we all already knew: for Sōsuke love ain't matter of appearances. See the sea as you never imagined!"
44,Ponyo,10,12 September 2009,This is NOT for kids movie,"No no and no ! This is not a movie for kids like lot of reviewers were talking. It's not a fairy tale nor a love story between a fish-girl and a boy. I though the same too until the fish raised legs and the city was flooded. This is an environmental story of human evolution. Since Devonian Era 400 million years ago the first fish evolved legs and started to walk on land (It's not coincident Miyazaki showed full of ancient Devonian fishes). We all came from water, and now pollute it. And yet with the global warming, the ice will be melt, the Earth will be flooded with ocean again, and yes we will come back to water... it's only some hundred years more ... or even shorter with some nuclear-wars... I'm sorry for my bad English but please don't say it's a simple pure story for kids..."
45,Ponyo,,5 September 2009,"A goldfish doesn't look anything like this, but I don't care!","Coming after Pete Doctor's ""Up"", now widely considered to be one of Pixar's best films, Hayao Miyazaki demonstrates with his new movie ""Ponyo"" that HE is still the king around these parts. It is his first film since ""Porco Rosso"" to make full use of hand-drawn images, in vein with the very finest of the classic Disney animated features. But this movie goes beyond blatant comparison with those films, and takes its place among the director's most distinctive works.Purportedly, the film is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Little Mermaid,"" of which Disney studios already made their adaptation in 1989. But this is not a simple retread of the story; it is a wild elaboration. Like the film guru Quentin Tarantino, Miyazaki makes a habit of mostly following his characters as opposed to leading them straight through. Thanks to his painstaking, expressive animation, we are able to clearly observe the details of behaviour that makes those characters so individual and memorable. The casting for the English dub has been well chosen from Oscar nominees like Liam Neeson and Matt Damon, to sparkling newcomers Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus. Now those two names would normally be cringe-inducing for me, but here that's not the case.Apparently I haven't gotten into the plot of the film, but I feel no need to do that. Anybody with a brain can catch onto this story rather quickly. All I can say though, is that I was in the theater by myself when I first saw this movie, and I was still enthralled. It's one of those rare late summertime movies that absolutely demands to be seen, no matter what age you are. It's a pleasure to regard just for itself, and one of the best films of the year!"
46,Ponyo,10,31 August 2009,Magical Miyazaki,"Many films end with two very definitive words: The End. At least they once did. ""The End"" is no longer in vogue and a good thing too. Such dramatic closure is often unfit for most movies, and corrupts our notion of the characters' lives continuing and developing well past the closing credits. Even Casablanca finishes with those two closing words; I was under the impression that it was supposed to be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Ponyo, the new film by the great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, does not contain the word ""end."" Instead, at the start of the film, Miyazaki gives us the caption: The Beginning. At first I thought this was a subtle joke by Miyazaki, considering that this is the man who has announced his retirement after his last three films, but soon realized that the film is about new beginnings, and the experience of watching it is akin to a rebirth. Miyazaki has crafted a piece of art that is so pure and innocent that while I was watching Ponyo every malevolent thought and action in my life was evaporated and all that remained was the pure optimism and hope of a beginning.Read my full review at http://cfilmc.com/ponyo/"
47,Ponyo,10,26 August 2009,"Ponyo- Not Miyazaki's best, but 10-stars nonetheless.","Few would argue that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability.(No. Too many are focused on John Lassiter's ""amazing"" ability to steal other movies plots, turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius . . . but i digress.)Miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically themed), and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance. Still, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies- children.That said, I am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability. Where else are you going to have a film where a three year old (my nephew Link) will sit still throughout the move, enthralled, a 7 year old (my niece Amber) loving it all her own (and able to appreciate the ""star power"" of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, a 12 year old (my nephew Aaron) who's review was ""of course it was good! Everything Miyazaki-san does is good!,"" a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation (er, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the mother characters (and I'm betting the older charas too) and loving the ""cuteness"" of the child characters.And that is what I respect most about Miyazaki-san. He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. On the surface, ""Ponyo"" could be seen as a simple story about a little fish-girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there, a little boy names Soske (somewhat like ""The Little Mermaid""), but there is an entire different level at play here. True to form, Miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters Ponyo's Mother, Soske's mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed.But the girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself. Once she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. Her father is trying to keep her innocent, and keep her a magical fish, but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination. Once human, she teams up with her friend, Soske, whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother Lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by Ponyo on her quest to become human. Frankie Jonas (yes. He's related to the Jonas brothers. Can we just get past that please?) gives, perhaps, the best performance in the film as young Soske (which is good since he has the most lines). His character is also strong willed, but also very respectful and friendly- characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on THIS side of the Pacific.In the end, Ponyo's father, Fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske will ""remember him fondly."" And once again, Miyazaki REFUSES to allow a character to become the stereotypical ""bad guy."" Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. No one in real life is completely a ""bad person."" All humans are various shades of gray. And that is exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. And then there's the animation itself. In a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film, especially the water, Miyazaki has chosen to incorporate NO CGI whatsoever. Certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means, but every film in this was hand-drawn and I, for one, was extremely grateful for that. The character animation was extremely fluid, and there even appeared to be some lip-sync going on (quite unusual for an anime film). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience. This is what animation used to look like- and what it SHOULD look like. In the end, I found Ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable. Certainly not Miyazaki's best (in my opinion, that honor is still held by Kiki's Delivery Service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the ENTIRE family."
48,Ponyo,9,23 August 2009,My first Miyasaki movie - what a delight,"My husband dragged me to this film as I had no interest in seeing some Anime cartoon. I was absolutely delighted by the simple story and amazing animation. In a digital world where effects are computer generated it was refreshing to see gorgeous, imaginative hand drawn animation. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a vivid fantasyland intermixed with minimal reality. I haven't seen animation like this since I was a child and it is wonderful to see it endure and succeed.The actors supplying the voices in the English version were fabulous. The length of the movie was PERFECT, especially for children who tend to get squirrelly in films. Overall a delightful experience worth the very expensive ticket prices we have nowadays."
49,Ponyo,10,17 August 2009,"Ponyo, a Little Tale of Respect","Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, is a little tale that speaks of respect for the ocean, respect for humans young and old, and respect for cultural differences. It is a new tale of a little goldfish wishing to be a girl, rather than a retelling of Disney's Little Mermaid. Miyazaki has animated by hand, a whimsical, magical film for the young and the young-at- heart. The film begins with a slow undulating blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish, and scores of little fanciful goldfish with childlike faces. There isn't any need for narrative, the motion of the creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi tell the beginning. Released last summer in Japan, Ponyo won the Japanese Academy's award for Best Animation Film and Best Score (Jezebel.com). The fanciful little goldfish, Brunhild, leaves her ocean home on a jellyfish. Upon reaching the surface she is caught up in a fishing net full of other fish, garbage, and sludge. She is propelled into a jar, which is rolled to shore where five-year-old Sosuke (voice by Frankie Jonas) retrieves it. He cuts his hand when breaking the jar open to free the little goldfish. Brunhild tastes his blood, which heals Sosuke's cut, and puts in motion her transformation to a human, at the same time throwing nature out of balance. Sosuke puts the little goldfish in a green pail and names her Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), meaning soft and jelly like. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Fey), lets him take Ponyo to school, which is right next door to the nursing home where she works. Lisa's crazy driving down the picturesque winding road, past a dry dock, through the bustling fishing town, and up a tree-lined road to the nursing home is representative of Miyazaki's wonderful sequence of action and illustrates perfectly a parent's hectic morning. Miyazaki has created another strong, independent, female character in Lisa. Making her a loving, sensible, modern mother both to Sosuke and Ponyo. Lisa's telephone conversation with the not-coming-home-again husband, Kiochi (Matt Damon) because the ship he captains must make another run, is a typical wife's reaction. Later that evening Sosuke intercedes using a signal lamp to speak to his father as the ship passes the cliff their house sits on. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochi's apology and jumps up and signals ""Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off,"" it is a hilarious scene. But, when Sosuke takes the signal lamp and tells his dad ""Good Luck, Love You,"" Lisa hugs him and tells him he has a good heart, it is a very poignant scene.My personal favorites are Miyazaki's elderly, granny-type women in wheelchairs at the nursing home, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their interchange over Sosuke's little goldfish is wonderful and reminiscent of the bickering between the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they trudge up a long flight of stairs in Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo's magical sea-god father, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson) resembling the wizard Howl arrives to take Ponyo back to her ocean home. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try and put nature back in balance, but magical little Ponyo escapes again upsetting more elixir in the process, and causing a tsunami. Running on the backs of giant dolphins to get to Sosuke, this redheaded, little girl reminds the audience of the stubborn, adventurous little Mei in My Neighbor Totoro. Ponyo is just as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo has done he calls for Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett), the Goddess of the ocean, to help with the situation. This wise, calming Goddess arrives in a blue flowing garment that never ends. She has a private talk with Lisa discussing the future of the young children, which helps the audience understand Sosuke and Ponyo's relationship is not that of lovers, but of brother and sister. The life-goes-on quiet simple ending is typical of Miyazaki films leaving the audience full of hope."
50,Ponyo,10,14 August 2009,Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo was another of his animated masterpieces,"My first exposure to Japanese animation director Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli production company was when an English-dubbed version of Spirited Away was released about 7 years ago. What a wonderfully creative and unique film experience that was! So on that note, I managed to get my movie theatre-employed friend to see this new film of Miyazaki with me especially since he loves all things Disney (this movie's U.S. distributor). Once again, all I can say is ""Wow!"" What awesome visuals concerning the way water is depicted as the ocean...and what about the title character's transformation from a goldfish to...and seeing how some characters' demeanor changes...and, well, watch this movie if you want to know what I'm talking about. Oh, and the voices being used for this American-dubbed version: Tina Fey, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Cloris Leachman, and Lily Tomlin. Good choices all. Does everything make sense? No, but that's part of the childlike charm that permeates throughout. There's plenty of funny scenes concerning Ponyo and the boy and many other people they encounter. Oh, I think I've written too much so I'll just highly recommend Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo."
51,Ponyo,10,14 August 2009,Miyazaki's most adorable work since Totoro... that it's a masterpiece should be a given,"Ponyo is the kind of movie you'll want to see to enjoy the- insert superlative/great-awesome-wonderful adjective here- animation, the outstanding and eye-popping wonders of water (yes, water) and all of the characters who have a purity and goodness that reaches to everyone, even the supposed villain. But it's also a movie you will *need* to see if you've had a bad day, or unsure that humanity is worth a damn or has people who can actually be caring and thoughtful or unselfish. Sometimes those of us who aren't children need these kinds of stories and works of art, that lift the spirit and get us going on our day a little brighter, if only for a little while, thanks to a piece of anti-cynicism. My Neighbor Totoro was like that, as are Miyazaki's other great films, and this is another.Oh sure, if you have a little kid- or if somehow you're a kid reading this- you should not be wasting any more time and rush out to see it. A clue to its appeal as a modern-day work of the extraordinary is that the English dubbed version, the one that I and American and English audiences are seeing in theaters, was written by Melissa Matheson, the writer of E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. And no wonder: it's about a little boy living with his mother- we get the sense, as in E.T., that the parents have some problems getting along, though in this case it's because the father works on a ship out at sea- and one day he finds a goldfish by the water at his home (the 'cliff by the sea' that the Japanese title originally had), accidentally cuts his little finger which the goldfish suckles at, and takes the goldfish home.Unbenownst to the little boy, Sosuke, little Ponyo as she is called turns into a human - or rather, wants to become human once she is taken away by her father, the underwater wizard-of-sorts Fujimoto (voiced perfectly by Liam Neeson). She comes back to Sosuke after a daring escape thanks to a horde of other little goldfish, and the little boy and half-girl-half-magical-fish become best friends. If this sounds silly, maybe it is. In other hands this could be mangled kiddie-movie fodder that might play out to only that little-kiddie movie audience. In the hands of Hayao Miyazaki, it's a one-of-a-kind marvel that will make one think of other movies and things, like E.T. or the Little Mermaid or even Pinocchio. It would be, I hope, the highest of compliments to say that Miyazaki's own love of Disney has at this point in his career reached another high-water mark; I would possibly want to watch this movie just as much, if not more, than the classic Disney at its best. It's that frickin' awe-inspiring.To give you an idea of the kind of awe it conjures, and the point of view that Miyazaki operates here as he has before in Totoro, a little tangent. For those who may have played the video game Katamari Damacy, there are little scenes that play in-between the individual boards where we see a story develop with two little kids who are being taken along to the airport by their mother. They keep looking out their window in the car and on the airplane and see so many wonders: the Cosmos himself, a crazy universe-god-thing, and other wild visions, and the kids say simply ""Mom, it's the Cosmos!"" ""That's nice dear, there's our flight,"" the mother replies. There's a scene just like this in Ponyo, where we see more clearly than even before this point of view, of a child's wonderment and happiness at fantastical things, and the adult's deadpan understanding of this. Only in Ponyo, it's nowhere near as campy or unintentionally hilarious as in Katamari.This is such magical material; I say that in the way that you'll be smiling even when you know there's nothing too extraordinary on the screen. But Miyazaki pushes his animators to another level than before, with his use of watercolors and pastels creating the underwater world like we might imagine or dream about after reading a book. Things move that normally wouldn't in animation, flow and vibrate with electricity, and the story keeps things lively and fun. And yet, Miyazaki has serious touches too, and like in Totoro we have that moment where a very hard moment for a child comes up (namely the possible peril or mortal danger their mother is in), but its done delicately and with tact, and the resolution just adds to the magic element in the material.Ponyo will make you giddy and squeal in delight. It's made not just for those who love animation (forget 'anime'), but for those who go to the cinema for something extra than just escape. It's the cinematic equivalent of a gigantic, all-encompassing hug - for 100 minutes. You don't want to leave it, and the only sadness is that it ends, even in that as-adorable-as-Totoro theme song over the credits. It's one of the best films of the decade, nevermind year."
52,Ponyo,9,7 August 2009,"Very cute and slightly ""Japanese"" but a fun ride","Miyazaki has been doing his mojo since the 70s and it's only been recently that his movies have made it American shores via Disney and fans fawning over his great talent. Ponyo is no exception. Although some of his other movies have been a bit more accessible to US audiences, some may find this one a bit on the fence being sort-of ""Japanese"" in its presentation. For the same reason Pom Poko is VERY ""Japanese"" and doesn't make much sense to US audiences, so too are *some* elements of Ponyo. This should not detract you from watching this fun film of growth, hope, and friendship.What does come across well is Miyazaki's very elaborate and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy. That coupled with his characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters. He steps out of his zone a bit with Ponyo as the main character is a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mom while his dad is away at work on the high seas. Although not lonely, Sosuke is just like any other curious boy who likes adventure and allure of the sea. Similar to Spirited Away, we see the different worlds of the humans and the sea creatures and I feel that Miyazaki may be trying to draw the viewers attention to the vast and undiscovered nature of things that live beneath the sea and our acceptance of them and thing that are different.I managed to watch the subtitled version of this last year and was pleased by the story and plot. Miyazaki has claimed that ""this is my last movie"" for many years but shortly after Spirited Away, he gave us Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo is certainly proof that Miyazaki has not hung up his spurs and continues to delight, innovate, and pioneer the most creative animated movies of all time. Watch Ponyo with an open mind and a tip of the hat to childhood fantasy and imagination and you'll be transported back to when catching Fireflies and secret hiding places were more important than boring grown-up stuff and eating your vegetables."
53,Ponyo,8,22 March 2009,"The Purity, Oh the Purity!","Rendered in beautiful water colors, Ponyo At The Cliff is definitely a sight to behold, vaguely remembering the trailer, witch i didn't find that impressive, i was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was. This film just washed over me with its purity.At the center is a young boy that comes into contact with a sea creature, and its their relationship that carries the movie. Miyazaki is a master both at creating memorable imagery and showing young ones interacting in a believable way with their little quirks intact.There are a few parts that didn't sit well with me. It would be an understatement to say that the music during a particular scene ""resembled"" Ride Of The Valkyrians, its a shame because such a precious film as this cant afford to take liberties and it hurt a otherwise truly great scene. The antagonist and its back-story never interested me either, but i guess it served more as a background then anything else.Anyway, great film. The boat trip scenario with all its imagery and sea-creatures stood out me thinks. Pure and magical. And yes, handrawn artwork is more intimate then computer animated, I'm really pumped for Princes And The Frog now."
54,Ponyo,4,19 November 2017,"Watch the trailer, you can decide from there if this is a movie for you","I was looking at under 100.000 votes animation feature films here on IMDb when I came across Ponyo for the 50th time. I remember watching the trailer a couple of years ago and again earlier this year and both those times I was turned of by the childish story and lack of characters other than the mom, Ponyo and the guy. Today I decided to have an open mind and just watch the movie. This movie is so incredibly boring. I have to admit that I am not a fan of Miyazaki like most of the people seem. For me, Spirited Away was a 7 and Howl's Moving castle I gave a 6. The conclusion for me is that all the titles of Miyazaki are quite overrated and as cool as Spirited Away is, they are are very resembling. For me a movie like The Secret of Kells, Moana and Kubo have more better animation and much more to the characters. I would not recommend anyone over 10 years old to watch this film. So my tip is, more than with any other movie, watch the trailer if you like it you will probably like the movie, but if the trailer doesn't convince you totally don't let the high ratings leads you, coz you will probably end up being bored for almost two hours."
55,Ponyo,7,29 June 2016,Weird with a Lot of Flaws but a Fun Kid's Movie,"I've only seen 2 Studio Ghibli films so far but I think this is definitely one of the weirdest. I mean, the plot itself isn't that weird. It's kind of your typical Little Mermaid story except with 2 eight year old kids. However, the specifics are really odd. I won't say too much because I don't want to spoil anything but let's just say it can get a little awkward. I think Ponyo herself is the main reason this movie is so weird. She does and says a lot of things that seem really out of place for a fish/eight year old girl. Not to mention that her dad is even more ridiculous. The other characters for the most part are fine except for the boy's mom. She drives like a freaking maniac when she has kids in the car during a deadly storm! I won't say anything else but she does some other stupid stuff throughout the movie. I think out of all the characters the boy is my favorite because he plays off all the weirdness just like the audience. The animation itself is pretty good though not as good as Arrietty. The colors in Arrietty are more vibrant and blend better while Ponyo's animation is a bit more sketchy. However, it's still nice to see hand-drawn movies is the 2000's and the water looks downright breathtaking. Overall, despite this being really weird, it's a fun little movie to check out at least once."
56,Ponyo,10,25 May 2014,love her,"Ponyo is a film aimed at child viewer, but to my opinion the whole world can see. Each of his works the genius of Japanese animation, Hayao Miyazaki, back again let flow his surreal wit, whose inspired not contribute or TV, no internet, and not using any of the two media. Studio Ghibli director develops its work in such a closed universe that recognizes personal failing even seen modern movies PIXAR. Ponyo is a work of great maturity but with the innocent soul of a child, particularly a sign of Miyazaki's work. The colorful and magical world that lies before our eyes get filled with hope even the most apathetic. I really liked this movie because it is full of magic and adventure, things that I like, but also makes you think of what he's capable friendship."
57,Ponyo,,28 December 2012,Very much for kids but still has plenty of charm and good animation,"I recently watched Omohide Poro Poro and it put me in the mood for some more Studio Ghibli that I hadn't seen before, which led me to Ponyo. The film is similar to Disney's Little Mermaid as it sees a fish wishing to become human as she builds a friendship with a human. This change causes real problems with the balance between the worlds of land and water, not least with her father who is desperate to get her back. Although it appears quite a childish film, I am used to these films having plenty for adults as well and indeed I thought that the themes of tsunamis and friendship would have plenty behind it for those looking, but sadly this was not the case and this is pretty much a film with everything front and centre.This is not a massive problem though because it is basically a kids movie and does no harm by playing to its target audience. The story is a nice simple one of friendship and adventure and I appreciated it being told in a straight and warming fashion, even if the adult part of me wanted a bit more than I was being given. The characters are simple too  from the central children through to the adults. The animation is the saving grace for an adult watching with kids, because it is visually really good with plenty of interest that is imaginative and beautifully drawn; perhaps not a consistent factor but for sure a large proportion of the film is a feast.Ponyo is still a film for kids first and foremost though and, like me, those coming to the film hoping for Spirited Away etc may be disappointed to find that it is a much simpler film than those others may have led them to believe and indeed they are likely to get bored with it as adults, animation excepted. However it is still a warming and charming kids film with bright simple characters and action and as such it is worth a look if you plan to share it with children."
58,Ponyo,8,5 December 2011,Take the kids and the goldfish to see this film,"Unlike some other writer / directors (the name ?Tarantino? comes to mind) Hayao Miyakazi has achieved global legend status by producing one masterpiece after another; Ponyo continues the tradition. As always the material is challenging, through the title character we are introduced to a world beneath the waves that intermixes humans and magical creatures none of whom are purely good or evil. As always, the animation is dazzling particularly several sequences where waves become sea creatures which chase our 5 year-old protagonist and his mother. As always Miyakazi outdoes all others in presenting dreamscapes where realistic people and boats mix with creatures lost to extinction hundreds of millions of years ago. Further, this may be Miyakazi?s most accessible film as he forgoes his normal plot point of some major war being waged and sticks to a simple environmental message. In short, see this one and then see the rest of his films available in the U.S."
59,Ponyo,,14 August 2011,A Hans Christian Andersen fairytale retold in lush oriental beauty!,"I watched this film on DVD yesterday with my sister and I fell in love with it. It's heartwarming and romantic and full of lush colours and I do hope Hans Christian Andersen will look down from the heavens upon this Japanese creation and smile with a warm heart.The romantic leads focus on a couple of young children as opposed to ""The Little Mermaid"". When you see Ponyo as a ""goldfish"", you just want to love her and take her up in your arms and her 5-year-old human boyfriend felt nothing other than those things when he saw her. As he takes care of her, a tender romance starts to form as she requests to be human too.What I adore about this film is that there is virtually no heartache whatsoever contained - nobody tries to separate Ponyo and her boyfriend and the importance of family is rampant.I'm putting two thumbs up for this movie and I'd put up more if I had more than two (which would be a bit disturbing)."
60,Ponyo,9,23 November 2010,A magical and charming delight,"This is not my absolute favourite from Miyazaki, but I still loved it. Ponyo was very magical and charming. I did feel though the ending could have had a little more to it, I am not sure whether I'd use the word incomplete but it didn't leave me completely satisfied. Small criticism aside, the animation is exquisite, typical Miyazaki really- Ethereal colours, beautiful backgrounds and interesting character designs make up the animation here. Another delight was the music, melodious, memorable and of sheer beauty. The script is good too, and I also loved the simple yet magical story and the charming characters especially the very sweet protagonist. The voice acting is top notch too, it is quite emotive and never feels bland. In conclusion, really quite charming and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
61,Ponyo,10,4 June 2010,Ponyo is truly fantastic.,"Ponyo is the greatest movie I have ever seen and in fact, it is my favorite film ever. I fell in love with the environment, the characters, and the plot of the film. Ponyo and Sosuke are the most adorable couple since Wall-E and Eve, and Bones and Boothe. The voice acting was done well and the animation was perfect. I don't know why some people think that the animation was bad. It was amazing because it was all done by hand and animated with a small crew. The themes of environmental conservation and true love were also brought up memorable for me. I recommend this film to anybody young or old. If you want quality family entertainment, don't take your kids to see money stealing flicks like Kung Fu Panda or Monsters Vs. Aliens which have no true quality, see this one which was made for art and pure storytelling."
62,Ponyo,10,27 March 2010,Disney sold out to a masterpiece!!!!,"it takes either an amazing, or a terrible movie for me to make a comment......this film was an amazing one!! i saw the trailer and thought it look so crazy i had to watch it...im glad i did!! this isn't the type of thing you would expect to come from Disney, they clearly sold out on this movie...and it was for the best! walt woulda turned in his ice pack at the thought of it....but woulda thawed out by the end result and danced the conga!!!! you can tell from the graphics of the movie that this is Japanese and i think that brings the most of the amazement to the film...what they lack on drawing in some aspects gets completely ignored by the amazing and perfect detail drawn on the most unnecessary of objects! your glued from start to finish! im 29 years old...my 4 year old daughter chose to watch shrek, so i chose to sit in the other room and watch ponyo alone....im so glad i did! id watch this movie over and over again!!....i hope my 2 year old son likes it hahahah!!! end result....WATCH PONYO AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!!"
63,Ponyo,9,21 December 2009,"Honestly, this is good.","The truth is, when Ponyo on the Cliff was released last year, I skipped it many times. The first time I saw the trailer, I decided that the movie is kind of outdated especially when you have just watched something like Ratatouille and Wall-E. Even my mom said it's a ""1980s cartoon"".The second time I skipped it was when my friend who majored in cinematographic told me it's ""brainless garbage which made him cry"". I thought to myself, how could some brainless garbage make a person cry? Anyway, I just kept skipping it.Finally, I was allowed to see it in HD, and I felt overjoyed to finish it. Yes, you can just argue this is for very young kids. But that doesn't jeopardize the beauty and charm the film brought. With a very slow but poetic path, the movie premised in breathtaking underwater scenes, then the main roles were introduced all in their most distinctive natures. Ponyo represents the wild side of childhood while the little boy represents the calm, obedient side. The portrait of his mom is also classic, giving you an insight into Easterners' personalities and lifestyles. There are no characters in this movie who don't charm and delight. And as all of the vivid details of childhood spread, one should know it's time to let go of your adult skepticism and cynicism. The equivalent movie in West might be Stand by Me. If you can't enjoy it, let's be honest, you may have totally lost your childhood innocence and probably lived a zombie-like life. This is definitely a good family movie to take your grandma, kids and nephews to. It's so magical that everyone indifferently finds his/her light-hearted reflection in it. Actually, the story is simplified, the pace tamed, and the ending optimized;and one can doubt if there's any real ""message"" in it. Like the usual Miyazaki movies, it has many interesting symbolization in it. And you should notice the boys and girls who start to fall in love become younger and younger, challenging your realistic minds to accept the basic concept of ""Love""......The truth is, Mr. Miyazaki has no intention to include any solid, ass-kicking messages in this movie. All he wanted is to help your family laugh and have a warm-hearted night."
64,Ponyo,9,16 November 2009,Another excellent film from Miyazaki,"Director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the modern titans of worldwide animation cinema, even though his films have not had as much diffusion as they would deserve.Unfortunately, his most recent film Ponyo on a Cliff, suffered from the same destiny because, at least in my country, it was released on very few cinemas and with zero publicity.That's a shame, because Ponyo on a Cliff is an excellent animation film which tells a very imaginative story, which is simple on its shape but complex on its depth.Ponyo on a Cliff does not obey to Hollywood formulas, there are not any musical numbers or well defined villains.It simply tells an ingenious, deep and hugely entertaining story.It would be a mistake to compare it with the Disney film The Little Mermaid only because both are based on the traditional fable from Hans Christian Andersen.They are so different with each other that it would not have any sense to say Ponyo on a Cliff is ""better"" (although I definitely enjoyed it much more), because it is based on a different value system, where selling toys or satisfying marketing requirements is not important...the emphasis is on showing the vision of a true artist like Miyazaki, whose amazing imagination forges a story of an unusual and unpredictable structure, but with human and realistic characters who are easy to identify with.The only fail I found on this movie is that some details feel a bit forced.In spite of that minor fail, Ponyo on a Cliff deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation for many things but mainly, because it is full of magic and imagination.It may not be Miyazaki's best movie (I think that one is Princess Mononoke so far), but still, this is an excellent film worthy of admiration."
65,Ponyo,9,17 September 2009,Miyazaki does it again!,"Ponyo, or Ponyo on the Cliff, is the story of a special fish whose father (voiced by Liam Neeson) once was human but has now decided to live his life under the sea, away from the filth and lowliness of the land creatures. His powers are great and he decides to bestow some of the them onto Ponyo.Ponyo (voiced by Noah Cyrus), however, has different ideals than that of her father. She longs to be a human and live a life more carefree than her father. She journeys away from home and ends up in the bucket of Sosuke (voiced by Frankie Jonas), a five year old boy who lives on a cliff by the sea. His mother Lisa (Tina Fey) hustles and bustles trying to get Sosuke and herself to school and to work while her husband (Matt Damon) is away at sea.The magic just begins when Sosuke realizes that Ponyo is more than just a little fish. When Ponyo is stolen back by her father, Ponyo decides enough is enough and uses her power to escape and become human. What follows can only be described as one of the most beautiful scenes in animation history.The rest of the story is a fantastic tale of friendship, family, and courage. The characters are fascinating and have a life of their own. There is an even balance with magic, imagination, and the real world.What makes Ponyo so amazing is the animation. Miyazaki held nothing back with making this film. The animation is unlike anything I have seen from him. His last several films have all had a similar look that has a very Miyazaki style. This is more free based and has no boundaries. Objects and creatures have an almost amoeba-like state while maintaining their structure. Ponyo especially is a very lucid creation. Her form shifts back and forth between fish, human, and what can only be described as Ponyo. It's a very warm feeling film with soft colors and a lot of them.The voice acting was exceptionally good. I liked the wide range of voice actors with Neeson, Fey, Damon, Betty White, Cloris Leachman, Lily Tomlin, and Cate Blanchett, not to mention the youths of the film, Cyrus and Jonas, two stars from Disney, one of the film's main producers along with Studio Ghibli.The one thing I wanted more of was a theme or sense of direction. I thought the story was a little too free form and started to go a few ways and then went somewhere else. It touched upon the environment a little but didn't go there with that. I thought they were going to talk about the family dynamic a little bit, but that was cut short as well. I guess in the end it is about friendship, which is nice I guess.Aside from that, there isn't anything wrong with Ponyo. The story is very entertaining and the animation is flawless. Miyazaki really came through with this one in a big way, reinforcing the point that he is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and not just for animation."
66,Ponyo,10,15 September 2009,I saw it cause is Miyasaki...,"I love his work a lot a lot....In the beginning i was soooooooooooooo hooked on it...but later, literally when Ponyo is falling asleep towards the end of the movie, I was falling asleep too. I think this movie has funny parts, but there were things that I didn't understand. At the very end of the movie I never understood if the world was flooded. I didn't understand the old lady that was crazy at the end( there were 3 main old grannies, the one that that believe in Tsunami). I dunno...probably I will see it later again, but not even Spirited Away or Nausicca or Laputa or Howl's or Mononoke never do this to me.Well, what the heck...it's Miyasaki. His movies are full of symbols that sometimes take me time to understand it or they are just explain it later in documentaries or comments."
67,Ponyo,10,8 September 2009,In the sea,"I vaguely recall my childhood in terms of the videogames I was playing. Nearly everything else, aside from my mother's illness, was secondary to me. One thing I still have yet to ""categorize"" in my mind is our saltwater fish tank. Mother and father acquired it in 1998 I think, and admiring it became one of my favorite pastimes. I would gaze at the many tropical fish we had, and even in their restricted area, they fluid movements captivated my young mind. Fish seem uninhibited to us meek humans because they can move freely in an area while we are restricted to moving linearly.Miyazaki-san's newest effort Ponyo reminds me of why I enjoyed our fish tank. It is a film without a defined purpose that appeals to our affinity for natural beauty. All of the film if hand-drawn in water paint-style which immerses the viewer, like the video game Okami. Even Finding Nemo isn't as effective in drawing audiences into the ocean like Ponyo does. With Pixar's film, I felt as if I was watching fish swim in the ocean, but with Miyazaki's film, I was in the ocean.The storyline is simplistic, even by Disney standards. The protagonist is Sosuke, a five-year old boy who lives on a cliff by the sea with his mother. He discovers a fish in ocean one day and names her Ponyo. Ponyo is actually one of many daughters of a sea wizard who forsook humanity to guard the ocean. He recovers her but she escapes back to Sosuke. Her journey involves multiple human-to-goldfish species changes until finally becoming a complete human at the end. No antagonist exists, as per usual in Miyazaki films. Ponyo's father, Fujimoto, appears sinister at the beginning but explains his rational as nature's protector.Unlike many of its contemporaries, Ponyo includes many magical elements and improbable plot points without feeling contrived. It is story that is entirely fantastical, so Ponyo's ability to resize objects feels completely in place. Near the film's conclusion, she and Sosuke swim with exotic fish through the treetops (Ponyo's unstable species causes a disruption in the harmony of nature) in a scene only Miyazaki could animate. The immature storytelling elements are beneficial to create a child-specific film that adults can enjoy. Too many ""children's films"" like G-Force are actually filtered adult films. Many of these so-called children's movies are incapable of shedding their adult origins. Look at Disney's Little Mermaid (not the novel). Ariel is drawn with a bikini made of sea shells and appears as an adult maiden. Ariel's existence is incomplete without her lovely prince. Ponyo, in contrast, is depicted as a child of no more than five years. She sees Sosuke not as a lover, but as a friend. She would otherwise be happy playing in the sea and causing trouble for Fujimoto. Her relationship with Sosuke may be romantic one day, but even Ponyo's declaration, ""Ponyo loves Sosuke"" is entirely innocent. Children speak without fully understanding the connotation of what they say. I find unusual that Disney would distribute Ponyo, heavily influenced by its own Little Mermaid, despite its complete superiority over its sexist inspiration.Voice acting is provided by Noah Cyrus (Ponyo) and Frankie Jonas (Sosuke) among more famous actors like Liam Neeson, Betty White, Tina Fey, and Cate Blanchett. Cyrus and Jonas are well chosen and deliver lines with as much exuberance as their characters portray. Their enthusiasm fit's Miyazaki's characters very well. I would probably have found the young Disney stars annoying in another film but not in this one. A flat performance would do injustice to the on screen animation. Be warned, however, you may find yourself overwhelmed with kiddie vocals if you do not enter a screening prepared for them.Miyazaki-san has a library full of animated classics that share similarities with each other. Ponyo falls into the My Neighbor Totoro ""group."" Whether it is ""better"" than its predecessor is purely a matter of taste rather than quality. Any of his films, depending on your age, will provide you an ideal or nostalgic experience.Note: This review is dedicated to Pauline Kael's review of The Little Mermaid that is available in her collection Movie Love. The comparison of Ponyo to the other film was made possible by that review.Note: This review is dedicated to Pauline Kael's review of The Little Mermaid that is available in her collection Movie Love. The comparison of Ponyo to the other film was made possible by that review."
68,Ponyo,10,23 August 2009,Miyazaki Has Done It Again,"After watching this movie, I'd have to say that Hayao Miyazaki has not disappointed me so far. I have watched every ounce of the film both in its original Japanese version and the U.S. dubbed version and no matter which one I watched, it was definitely worth every penny to watch at the movie theater! So, the plot is all about a goldfish named Ponyo who longs to become a real human girl after she is rescued by a human boy named Sosuke. Though her father doesn't seem to approve of this, nothing can seem to drive the two apart.Overall, I thought the animation was awesome and that choosing the U.S. voice actors was really clever. Ever since Miyazaki won his Oscar for his previous film ""Spirited Away,"" he proved that Japanese anime is not overrated. It doesn't matter what form of animation medium is chosen, as long as the story proves enough to impress an audience. According to what Miyazaki had to say at his visit in San Diego Comic Con, he was inspired by Disney's 1989 adaptation of ""The Little Mermaid"" to create this movie (except this is like looking through the perspective of a five year old rather than a sixteen year old). I thought the ending could have expanded a bit more further than shown (though I won't spoil that end). Anyway, this movie will definitely be worthy in a Miyazaki DVD collection."
69,Ponyo,8,29 June 2009,Welcome Back to Childhood,"For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience. Okay, you don't need to read any further now.I already guess most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture, so I should say Ponyo is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child: discovering the world as you wanted to see it, making up your own rules and boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time. Ponyo swerves away from many of the problems that all-age films tackle. It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen. They are not simple minded, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world. They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with. Many films regard children from the outside, as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter. Ponyo brings everyone back to that world. In Ponyo, there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most, which the film values with high esteem. It is worth it to remember, to feel it again."
70,Ponyo,,4 April 2010,Not one of Miyazaki best,"I know some people will thumb me down for not giving this movie a 9 or 10 but I really did feel that this was not one of Miyazaki best. That dose not mean I didn't enjoyed this film and it's safe for your kids who will probably love it. It's just that it could of been better.The movie has very strong things going for it. For example its fun to look at. I really loved the opening scene ware we first meet Ponyo and her father in there underwater home. Every thing is bringtly colored and gives off a warm feeling to the movie. At first I thought I would not like the story because It striked me as a little mermaid ripoff but I found that it did a great job at standing on its own. Miyazaki truly is a great story teller and he rarly disappoints.Now the main reason why I felt that this is weak conpaird to his other movies was mainly because of the human adults. They came off as really unrealistic even by children story's standards to me.POSSIBAL SPOILERS! For example Ponyo basically destroys the boys home town causing hundreds or maybe thousands of people to lose there homes. Yet no one but Ponyo parents seem to really care. Which is odd since through out the movie her father is betrayed as the main antagonist of the story. I felt that Ponyo never really notice how her actions affected other people and never learned her lesson. Pluse it would have been better if the adults would of reacted a little more realistic in the face of disaster. I know some miyazaki fans will point out how the adults acted in My Neighbor Totoro but that was different. I thought it was obvious the parents thought Totoro was imaginary since they never did see him. This one's a different story since by the end of it all mom and dad get the message loud and clear that Ponyo is real. So why is no one mad at her for whipping out there homes? SPOILERS END HERE!! Now to be fair to the movie I admit I could be being a little nip picky here. The movie is still entertaining and worth watching for kids and animation fans. The voice acting is great, the story in spite of its flaws held my attention and overall I had fun with it.If your new to Miyasaki's movies I would recommend watching some of his older films first. Spirited Away, Vally Of The Wind, Castle In The Sky, Howls Moving Castle and Princess Mononke are all good choices to start."
71,Ponyo,7,23 September 2008,Miysazaki's best animation in a film with a muddled story,"The plot of the film has a little sea creature, Ponyo, escaping from a sea wizard and then getting stranded near land where she is found by a little boy who becomes her protector. Eventually returning home, not so willingly, Ponyo decides to use magic and return to her friend.Let's cut to the chase I'm of mixed emotion about this film.The animation in the film is amazing with the opening sequence likely to be talked about for years to come. The film is filled with sequences that are truly amazing to look at (and will also be talked about). Clearly Miyazaki wanted to send out the message that he is the master animator at Studio Ghibli. Hands down this ranks with some of his best animation. Yes, it is that good-even when it become a throw back to his early anime days. (And while I'm at it it should be noted that there are references to his earlier films either intentionally or because its his style-which unfortunately results in so many of the women all looking the same)The problem for me is that some of the story is patentedly weird. It really is surreal at times. I mean that both in a good way and a bad way. The ""typhoon"" sequence where Ponyo goes back to he friend is both glorious and weird as the world seems to become flooded no one freaks out about. Okay, yea I'm an adult and the film is aimed at kids, but the film which gets so much real reaction and interaction right suddenly becomes overly fantastic and it doesn't bother anyone. Granted this leads into some magical sequences, but the films internal logic becomes nackered. I will follow things along to a point at the same time...stay consistent. I don't know what else to say...this film can get odd. Each sequence works but they don't always connect.I've seen everything except the Ghibli museum films that Miyazaki has done. I've seen many of his films in different translations, subs, dubs, what have you. I have problems with the end of Howl(which ceases to be fully clear). I prefer the English dub to the sub of Spirited Away (the dub is clearer in one or two points) and the Ghibli translation of Mononoke is better than any other (its poetic and explains things better). This is the first film Miyazaki has done that I'm really am at sixes and sevens about. Its both the best and worst of Miyazaki.Some examplesThe Bad: -The score is dreadful. Its a pastiche of European classical pieces that are too loud and booming for the story. It over powers the visuals. I mean do we really need a Ride of the Valkyrie rip off? I really really hate the music and I think its the cause of much of my dislike.-Several sequences go on too long. There are too many shots that serve no purpose, which is unheard of in a Miyazaki film. Do we really need repeated shots of ship propellers? Look at the sequence where Ponyo gets caught in the net at the start, there are shots that don't belong there since they detract from the suspense. It would be okay if he did it once or twice but he does it repeatedly, especially in the early part of the film (Its filler). The sequence at the kindergarten is kind of pointless. I don't know why its there its just moving Ponyo in a bucket around. -There was for me at times a sense of forced whimsy. Its as if he's trying too hard to be cute and lovable.Some of the sea wizard sequences have it.The film feels like some of the odd Euro-animation of the 1950's and 60's, in both a good and bad way. It reminds me of Paul Grimault's The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird (aka The Shepherdess and the Chimneysweep).The Good: -The opening sequence with Ponyo's escape and the wizard creating.They did this by hand?(a refrain I repeated often) -The animation of the mother grabbing her son and hugging him. It is so right in every way both physically and emotionally -Ponyo's escape and return to her friend. The image of her running on the fish waves is glorious even if its under cut by the Ride of the Valkyrie knock off. -Taking the real toy boat out. -Ponyo eating and just being in the isolated house on the hill.Ponyo is pure innocence and its magical. The characters work so much better than the script. I would rather have watched Ponyo and the little Boy wander about for 100 minutes then watch they story unfold as it does.It has so much good and so much bad...Its probably the least of Miyzaki's films despite having some his best work. I have a sense as more and more people see it they are going to scratch their heads. Okay yes, its for little kids, but even the best kids films work for adults (Nocturna, some of The Pirates that Don't Do Anything spring to mind from just this year. And Totoro from Miyazaki's own work-never mind the wonderful Ghibli museum short where the kindergarten pretends to go sailing and meets whales.)Is it a bad film? no. Is it a great film? no, but it has greatness in it. Forgive me for being a semi-naysayer but I will not give any film a pass on any level just because a certain person directed it.Ultimately you really do want to see this, preferably on a big screen since you will say WOW several times.(though I don't know if its going to happen since I don't know what the American studio suits will make of it)7ish out of 10"
72,Ponyo,10,12 January 2018,ADORABLE AND BEAUTIFUL,I really liked the film to a great extent. It was so good. I am a 17 year old but would have enjoyed it even more if I was a young girl as it was so adorable and cute and made so effortlessly. I could make this review alot more elaborate and mature but would like to keep it quite simple with lucid vocabulary and writing since the film reflects so much innocenes and purity and playful childish delight. So ponyo is a fish with a face ..unusual right. .who starts fancying this young 5 year old boy Soshuke and thus begins her quest to become a human..a great adaptation of little mermaid. I especially loved Soshuke's mom and their relationship since she was such cool mom and an awesome example of a mom and a good human being even if she is flawed like everyone At first I was quite skeptical going into the film as I thought it won't be that good my I was wrong. The animation is immensely beautiful and each frame is art so thats all I can say ..the story and direction are amazing since the characters stay with you and the film just draws you in and you feel the simplicity yet the great depth of the messages and profoundness. Definitely enjoyable and one common thing with spirited away that is very entertaining and emotionally layered so yes 10 stars:).The character development is also really good as soshuke is just a hero.
73,Ponyo,9,30 November 2017,9/10,Very very good animation by studio Ghibli maybe a smidgen short of being a great film. Great looking film with a nice story and intricately developed main characters. Beautiful opening credit sequence too. Perhaps a little less explained in the story department and an overall impression that the story is just a teeny less complex than hoped for and hence the 9 stars. Many love this film and I understand the love for the film.9/10
74,Ponyo,8,14 November 2017,A boyhood adventure,"Ponyo is a Japanese animation by Studio Ghibli. Ponyo follows the story of a goldfish that wants to become human and the boy that discovers her. Ponyo is dubbed by Japanese voice actors and actresses and English voice actors and actresses from Hollywood.Ponyo is a beautifully animated movie. Much like the other movies in the Studio Ghibli catalog, Ponyo engrosses the audience with its characters and the personal struggles that they overcome. Ponyo does not have a traditional villain in the classic Hollywood sense. It has characters and their personalities. It is remarkable that a movie like this can be appreciated by adults. The writers did an excellent job creating the characters and having the tension and enrichment derived from plot and characterization.I recommend Ponyo to both children and adults. It is a movie that can stand the test of time."
75,Ponyo,,9 September 2017,Being Human,"Rescued by a human boy, an inquisitive goldfish grows human features and becomes a young girl herself in this fantasy film from Hayao Miyazaki. On the surface, 'Ponyo' might sound like a simple fairy- tale, but with such youthful and altruistic protagonists, the film soon becomes less of a love story and a more a fantasy indulgence movie in which a boy's greatest dream of being able to play with his new pet like a best friend comes true. The goldfish's father, who comes to the surface to bring her home, is an unexpectedly fascinating character too; he is the ultimate overprotective parent, ruing ""if you can only remain pure and innocent forever"", with the film as much a tale about parents letting go and letting their kids be themselves as is it a film about pet relationships. Not everything about the film totally adds up; the boy's mother, for instance, does not even stop to question who this little girl is who claims that she used to be her son's pet fish. The film makes up for any narrative gaps though with some great ecological messages as per Miyazaki norm (human ocean pollution in this case) and the animation is simply exquisite, with blue fish and ocean waves magically blurring together at certain key points."
76,Ponyo,9,2 September 2017,A Tsunami of Emotions from Master Miyazaki...,"Whether on Earth, Air or Water, Hayao Miyazaki is always in his element. The Master can depict a hostile or kindly wilderness, a sky filled with thunderous clouds or a tidal wave or any possible natural setting or ecosystem with a scientific caution for details, but always with a delicacy in the line that only hand-drawn animation can provide. I think there's a reason that goes beyond aesthetic considerations: CGI can make everything possible, but going for the hard way deepens the spiritual connection with the subject and we know how deeply Miyazaki feels about Nature.Watching the magnificent jelly-fish ballet at the opening made me realize how CGI almost ruined the magic of animation. There's no doubt that ""Finding Nemo"" rendered a more spectacular vision of the ocean but remember the bubbles in ""Little Mermaid"", the flood in ""Fantasia""'s 'Sorcerer's Apprentice' or the 'Monstro' sequence in ""Pinocchio"", the depiction of sea demands a level of painstaking efforts that computer imagery solved too instantly to carry any form of poetry. And the merit of Miyazaki is to make a film that looks drawn, even more cheaply than the films I mentioned, you can spot some coarse circles when you freeze the images and realize that when taken alone, they don't invite for wide-eyed reactions, but put together, they do justice to the majestic beauty of nature and more than anything, they're accessible. We feel like we want to drown into it. CGI makes beauty an inaccessible thing, too beautiful to be true.Animation for Miyazaki almost works on a spiritual level, the more efforts you put, the more devotion you display to your subject and the more emotionally rewarding the experience is. To put it simply, the effects of ""Ponyo"" are actually less impressive than ""Chihiro"" or ""Mono-noke"" (which isn't saying much) but the effect of the story is no less powerful. It also seems like with age, Miyazaki has developed more serenity and doesn't even try to spice up his plots with antagonists, even three dimensional ones. ""Ponyo"" is a villain-less story about a little half fish/half human creature who hazardously drifts ashore in a small fishing town, to be rescued from the jar bottle she was stuck in, by a five-year old little boy named Sosuke. She thanks him back by licking his and healing his blood wound. When she's taken back by her father, a sort of wizard/ scientist she says she wants to live among humans and is immediately locked in. We learn later it's one of the side-effects of licking human blood.But her siblings (little fishes with anthropomorphic faces) allow her to grow some magical powers and become a little girl. What follows is one of the most epic scenes of any animated film, and I'm glad that ""The Ride of the Valkiries"" won't be forever associated to a deadly bombing in Vietnam but also the exhilaration of a little girl's joy, literally running over the waves, causing a tsunami over the sea side. This scene is too epic for words but it settles the film's status as one of Miyazaki's best, he literally gets intoxicated by his own wizardry and provides one moment we didn't see coming. The strangest thing is that a tidal wave was a possible scenario but one would have expected a bad guy to cause it, here it's the very joy of Ponyo that will cause troubles on Earth, as if things were easily getting out of control with children, even with the best intentions, so adults aren't totally useless.I love movies that can both say a child must follow his dream but listen sometimes to his parent, like Disney's ""Pinocchio"". Ponyo has some connection with the little boy, with a father who proves to be a responsible man, worried that her disappearance provokes a loss of imbalance and threatens the Earth, and a mother who carries some resemblance with the fairy who gave him life. Sosuke's mother is a strong-willed woman who braves danger in order to save old women from a nursery home, and even the old ladies have enough wisdom to provide some good lessons to Sosuke and complete the positive depiction of humanity over three generations. This is a film where children can act like adults, through the beautiful friendship between Sosuke and Ponyo and when old women can act like children too. And then there's Ponyo, one of the most fascinating animated characters of recent memories.Just from the start you can tell there's energy pumping in her little body, she just wants to get the hell out, and no matter how hard you squeeze her, there are not enough bubbles to contain her. Her head takes a human form, she grows palms that turns into hands and feet and the connection with human evolution are unmistakable. We all came from the water, and maybe we should value the luck we had to grow as complex but fully functioning creatures. Yes, we'd rather have Ponyo as a girl than a fish; she's more relatable that way, especially since it's driven by friendship, another relatable human emotion, like love or joy. And maybe ""Ponyo"" is an invitation is an invitation to value our gifts as human beings and thus respect nature.The film also shows the ravages of pollution, the trash left in the sea in sequences that recalls the mysterious guest's wash in ""Spirited Away"".Miyazaki is known for his environmentalist views, but the message doesn't come as a warning or a threat but a simple invitation to respect the creatures who didn't ""choose"" to get off the sea, respect their environment, their source of life which happens to be ours. Sure, it's relevant for Japan, an Island that has always been dependent on the benefits of sea but the film is also a universal hymn for love, friendship and harmony between men and nature. And it's also a terrific feel-good movie!"
77,Ponyo,9,20 June 2017,Hayao Miyazaki Brings a World Bursting with Color to Life,"From the opening sequence in Ponyo, the world is filled with vibrant, radiant colors. There are blues, yellows, greens, and reds all over the place. Miyazaki and his team of artists leave no space untouched. It is part of what makes Ponyo such a beautiful film.Other than the eye-popping colors of the world, there is something else about the world of Ponyo that becomes quickly apparent. There is no telling what may come to life. The plot and the universe it takes place in is one of magic and fantasy and the movie is made all the better for it. Something I noticed about Miyazaki's direction is how well he films movement. There are constant movements in Ponyo, both of characters and objects. Miyazaki balances both movement - not always in the same direction, though sometimes - in the foreground and background frequently. Much of the plot of the movie surrounds the ocean, which lends itself quite well to movement. There is also a great mix of animated backgrounds and drawn and painted ones, all of them bringing a different charm to the world of Ponyo."
78,Ponyo,8,19 June 2017,Hey Little Mermaid - you're in Miyazaki's house!,"Just so you know where I'm coming from, I think even a sub-par Miyazaki film is better than most other films. Ponyo is Miyazaki's unique take on the Little Mermaid story by Hans Christian Andersen, and in many ways it makes Disney's version look trite. Once again, Miyazaki manages to build a world that is simultaneously strange and yet familiar. With any Miyazaki film, you know it's going to be 1) weird, 2) unpredictable and 3) wonderful. If you just embrace the weird, Miyazaki pays off with the wonderful. Ponyo delivers, mostly, but falters a bit on the finish. The first 3/4 of the film is great, but the ending feels rushed and a bit ""cheap"". The weaknesses of this story are similar to two other Miyazaki films: Totoro and Howl's Moving Castle. Like Totoro, there is an extremely annoying theme song which thankfully only appears in the closing credits of Ponyo. Similar to Howl, the story builds satisfactorily, only to rapidly come to an unsatisfying close. But overall, Ponyo is engaging, interesting and conveys a sense of childlike wonder that is classic Miyazaki.Many people have commented on the strangeness of a 5 year-old boy and an apparently similarly aged girl being ""in love"", as well as the boy having the maturity level and responsibilities of a teen. While this definitely falls in the ""weird"" category, is it really any stranger than all of Miyazaki's child characters showing respect for their elders and for each other? This is a fantasy, after all, so if you're going to buy into a mermaid type creature becoming human, why not a 5 year-old acting like a young adult? But after watching the film, I think Miyazaki intentionally set the ages of Sosuke and Ponyo well below the pre-pubescent range. Doing so allowed him to portray this beautiful story without any possible hint of sexuality. TLDR: This is an absolutely beautiful film that is only slightly lessened by some minor negatives like a weak ending and an annoying theme song (that doesn't appear until the closing credits)."

80,Ponyo,10,4 November 2016,Quality Movie As Always 4 Miyazaki,"Now, Hayao Miyazaki is one of my favorite movie producers. He makes very quality anime films that all ages can get and enjoy. He is enthusiastic with his art and very creative/emotional. Ponyo is one of Miyazaki's newer films but it isn't the least at all. He incorporates so many genres all in one like; romance, drama, adventure, action, amongst so much more. The basis of the plot of this movie is the main character, Ponyo, who is a fish at them time escapes from her home in the ocean. She escapes to the coast where she finds a little boy named, Sasuke. They have many adventures and run into some trouble with each other. In the end they fall in love and Ponyo becomes a human. Pretty eventful, right? That's why its ranked in one of my top favorite movies."
81,Ponyo,10,26 April 2016,Great to see Miyazaki again!,"It's been way too long since I've seen a Miyazaki film. It's a shame that his films don't do near the box office reception of something like that awful Yu-Gi-Oh movie. Of course, this is still the highest grossing of his films. I truly believe this is close to ""Spirited Away"" as one of his best works. I guess it's because the animation is just so wonderful. I mean, it really seems like every moment of this film there is movement involved. There's a slight change in the outlines of all the characters.I had no idea this was inspired by ""The Little Mermaid"". It certainly seems nothing like the Disney movie. I personally don't find that one of my favorite Disney films and I find this much better. The voice work is fantastic. I'm generally not into celebrity voice actors but they make it work so well here. This film might be his most adorable. I guess it's just great to see Ponyo's miniature sisters swimming around everywhere.The plot is that there's this fish that escapes from her underwater home and meets a boy named Sosuke (yep, that reminds me of Sasuke from Naruto), making her want to become human. Every character is just teeming with cuteness. I especially love how realistic all the underwater creatures are. I think my favorite part might just be the first six minutes without dialogue as we see how well detailed they are. This really is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Not only is the pacing wonderful, but it's great to see a lot of the more mundane scenes like Sosuke's mother getting through her day. It shows that as strange as any animated film may be, it does in fact work hard to be realistic.This is only my third Miyazaki film, but already you can call me a fan. It even seemed like he was trying to imitate western animation more here. Ponyo as a fish and her sisters look a lot less like his normal style. It's always great to experiment with something new, especially for someone as great as him. Even every bit of the credits is adorable.I wish this guy would work for Pokemon! Hey, it's my first IMDb review! This is easily a 10/10!"
82,Ponyo,7,27 February 2016,"Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is an adorable Miyazaki movie but because of the odd story, I wouldn't recommend it as someone's first Miyazaki movie.","If you aren't familiar with Hayao Miyazaki, he's like the Japanese Walt Disney. He and his studio, Studio Ghibli, are responsible for Spirited Away, Grave of Fireflies, Princess Mononoke and others. Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea (henceforth referred to as Ponyo) is one of their most recent films. I love Miyazaki movies, particularly how they animate water; Ponyo's defining characteristic is that it's about the sea so, naturally, it was on my to-watch list.Plot wise, Ponyo feels pretty thin. There is a fish that wants to become a little girl. Only through true love can this happenand also only through true love can she save the world from being flooded.There isn't too much else to say about this one, quite honestly. The animation is beautiful, Ponyo (Nara) and Sôsuke (the little boy, voice by Hiroki Doi, who finds Ponyo) are adorable, and the music is great, and it has a happy ending.If you were unfamiliar with Miyazaki, I wouldn't recommend this as your introduction to his movies because of the odd plot. I'd start off with something like Spirited Away or Kiki's Delivery Service, and then after a little while, add Ponyo to your queue.I checked on the cast of voice actors for both the original Japanese cast and the American dub. Looking at the cast, you can tell this was definitely a big budget movie; Matt Damon (Kôichi), Betty White (Sôsuke grandmother), Tina Fey (Sôsuke's mom), and last but not least, the voice of the villain is Liam Neeson! We watched the original Japanese audio and it was great but, if you prefer dubs, I think Ponyo would be a good experience. Although, now that I'm thinking about it, Liam Neeson's voice is so distinct I wonder if it would break my suspension of disbelief."
83,Ponyo,,4 January 2016,Ghibli's version of Disney's version of The Little Mermaid,"Spoilers, but really, there's not much to give away, its Ghibli's version of Disney's version of the Little Mermaid.Synopsis: Ponyo is a goldfish who lives under the sea with her wizard father and many goldfish sisters. One day she ventures to the surface to satisfy her undying curiosity about the world above the surface. She meets a boy named Sosuke there, and a strong bond of love develops between them. She gets into her father's magical elixirs, miraculously acquires legs and goes to live with Sosuke on the land as a real human girl, but Sosuke must make a commitment to her, or she will dissolve into sea foam, and the world might end (not really sure about that last part, it wasn't very well explained)Story: 6.0 This, as the poster says, is the Little Mermaid. Well, kinda. Hans Christian Anderson's The Little Sea-Maid was actually a tragedy, and had an appropriately tragic ending. Now, there's nothing wrong with doing a Miyazaki version of the Little Mermaid, but I still can't give it high marks for originality, unlike many of his other movies which had brilliant stories. Really, the thing I had the biggest problem with was that Miyazaki set everything up to follow the Anderson version, even adding the sea foam element, but at the last minute, the great ""test"" ended up being nothing but an underwhelmingly simple question. Lots of buildup, and then the story Disneyed out, lacking the courage to stick with the Anderson ending. Just like Disney, they take Anderson's The Little Sea-Maid and tack on a happy ending, but this was obviously tacked on with little effort. Perhaps if the ""test"" had been more of an ordeal I could have accepted it. We might as well have been watching an animated version of one of Shakespeare's tragedies, but everybody lives in the end, with nothing more than a single line of dialogue to explain the difference.I understand that this was supposed to be a movie for five year olds, but Miyazaki seems to have forgotten that five year olds don't pay for movie tickets or buy DVDs, their parents do. This movie, unlike his other works, has little to offer older audiences. It doesn't have to end with the mermaid dead, but you could have at least let the tension build so audiences felt relief when the expected tragic end was avoided.Animation: 8.0 The animation here is not as strikingly beautiful or detailed as Spirited Away, but it's still gorgeous. The character designs are typical for Ghibli. Perhaps the best of the visuals appears about half way into the movie, where Ponyo has acquired the magic she needs to become human and she runs along the surface of the stormy ocean to get to the land and see Sosuke. It's impressive, and worth watching the movie if just for this sequence.Sound: 7.0 The Japanese cast definitely put more emotion into their performances. I wish Disney would hire more professional voice actors rather than going for big names. Not that Liam Neeson or Cate Blanchett did a bad job. Actually I enjoyed their performances. It's just that they are so recognizable, and also that there are so many truly great voice actors and actresses out there that could have done this, possibly better. A good example is during the scene where Sosuke and his mom are driving in the storm, trying to get home from the Senior Center while the waves crash around them. Tina Fey's performance is good, but Tomoko Yamaguchi was superior, vocally conveying the peril of her situation where Fey sounded more ""in control."" The music was almost entirely orchestral, and fit the feel of the movie. There were very few vocals. The credit song, ""Ponyo on a Cliff by the Sea,"" is cute and fun. Overall, it's a good soundtrack for the movie, but not one I would buy.Characters: 7.0 Characters are where Miyazaki has always excelled. He is such a keen observer of human behavior, especially that of children, that his animation captures them like magic and this is no exception. However, when re-creating the story of the Little Sea- Maid one character was left out, and that robbed the story of its necessary tension. In the original, there is another girl. The Prince has to choose between the Mermaid and a human Princess. It's a triangle, and that is of course why the ending fell flat. Of course he was going to choose Ponyo, there was nobody else. Also, Sosuke has a dad who is captain of a ship. The part seems to have been added just so Matt Damon could have half a dozen lines in the film. Add to this that earlier in the movie, Fujimoto, Ponyo's dad, states that he wants to rid the world of all the nasty humans, but now he's fine with his daughter becoming one and going off to live with them. That's a hell of a flip-flop to let go completely unexplained. Unfortunately, Fujimoto's miraculous change of heart seems to be the only development we get from any character in the show.Overall: 7.0 There were moments of pure magic in this film, as there are with all Miyazaki films. It was beautiful. While there may have been issues with the story, the animation and sound were still worthy of a Ghibli film, and that makes it worth watching. I recommend it, but only to those who have already seen all the others. If you still haven't seen Spirited Away, Mononoke Hime, Nausicaa, or My Neighbor Totoro, see those first."
84,Ponyo,9,18 August 2015,"Very heartwarming film, no question.","A goldfish(Nara) is found by a human boy(Doi). The Wizard(Neeson) is found to be the father of the goldfish. The human boy calls it Ponyo hence the name of the film. Ponyo is captured by the Wizard. Ponyo's friends help get her back with the human boy. Sôsuke's mom(Fey) is gone and has been taken by The Wizard. The Wizard and the Ponya's Mom changes Ponyo back to a fish. However a clever old lady realises that Ponyo is actually in danger along with the mom and the Residents of a nearby Nursing home. So the Sea Goddess has a change of heart and turns Ponyo into human. IN order for this to happen Sosuke and the goldfish must ""be on land and jump in the air"". So overall, not bad a film. My first time ever seeing the film. Yet I never heard of it or even saw it in cinemas. hahahah. I only saw it on my TV Guide and decided to check it out."
85,Ponyo,9,18 April 2015,An unusual tale of romance and serendipity!,"Another great piece from Hayao Miyazaki, it is difficult to not to love Studio Ghibli productions because Ponyo (2008) is immensely lovely and fantastically magical. This is certainly what happens when imagination meets creativity and animation.An unusual tale of romance and serendipity, two children from different worlds met and their lives changed forever. It might be unconventional but all of the scenes will only leave us think that the precious entity called life is equally strange and beautiful.As tradition, the stunning visuals combined with amazing film score and voice casts make the anime story conceivable. With plenty of endearing characters, fictional sea creatures and unexpected scenes including exotic ancient fishes coming to life at various points, one can never help themselves to take delight in watching Ponyo (2008).However, Ponyo (2008) is also filled with horrific elements even though most of the time it is light-hearted. The many important social and environmental messages might have concealed those but what's sad is that ultimately, the happy ending makes it easy to overlook the damage and disaster caused especially when the absorbing visuals and story has already effectively distract most audiences from thinking about them from the start.If you love the elements of child-likeness and innocence, these two destined future lovers are surely pleasant. Although Sōsuke is just five, he is very independent just like many Japanese children out there. Then, Ponyo the goldfish with human face might not be familiar with the land but she learns and adapts well. Her transformation is just so magical and she is super adorable and kind-hearted!As a whole, Ponyo (2008) is charming on its own unique way. Although it has a simplistic ending which I usually do not like, I am sure you will find yourself liking this anime film. Why? Honestly, I am not easily pleased even though I might seem to be lenient in writing movie reviews sometimes but this anime film is terrifyingly good! It is one of my favorite now! If only the ending is not that simple, Ponyo (2008) could easily become my #1 favorite Studio Ghibli film and unthrone Grave of the Fireflies (1988) and Spirited Away (2001) from my top two."
86,Ponyo,9,6 April 2015,Ponyo is swimmingly good !!,"Ponyo is really one of the most beautiful animated features of all time. The animation sequences of the underwater world and all the prehistoric fish that later arrive are just mesmerizing. The water has a movement and range of colors that are unseen in any previous attempt to tell watery tales. The characters are a little unusual and at first it may be hard to connect fully with the story, but as many Ghibli features, this one has a fairy tale to tell. It will hold up in repeated watches just as well as classic Disney film and it has most wonderful underwater animation ever, it is a marvel and will be cherished in this household with the many other Ghibli films we own and rewatch for fun. It lacks a little bit of the edge of some Miyazaki films, but is right in line with his other kids stuff like Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service."
87,Ponyo,,3 April 2015,Another Delight From The Greatest Animator Of Our Times,"Irresistibly charming, immensely adorable & truly magical, Ponyo is an intimately crafted, elegantly narrated & richly animated tale that takes a leaflet out of ""The Little Mermaid"" story to deliver a cinema that brims with originality, imagination & creativity from start to finish and is a joyous celebration of childhood as well as the innocence it resonates.Set in an oceanside town, Ponyo tells the story of its titular character; a goldfish princess who is rescued by a 5-year old boy who names her ""Ponyo"". The two bond quickly but her father brings her back into the ocean after which she unleashes enough magic to cause an imbalance in the natural order of life & makes her intention clear of becoming a human.Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki who has continued to defy every expectation with his subsequent features, Ponyo is another wonder from the master storyteller that presents him capturing the beauty & cheerfulness of early years with same passion & simplicity that was evident in his very own 1988 classic My Neighbor Totoro.While the story continues to evoke a sense of warmth & love from its audience throughout its runtime, what's really heartwarming about it is the attention it gives to a few elements that actually mean a great deal to children but is often overlooked by adults. The portrayal of childhood has been extremely convincing in every Miyazaki film & Ponyo is no exception.The hand-drawn animation itself bears resemblance to drawings made by children yet there is stunning level of detail in those frames. And the breezy pace with which its plot unfolds is a definite plus but when coupled with its mesmerizing score, harmless tone & simple themes, Ponyo ends up being an absolute delight for viewers of all ages & is absolutely worth your time n money."
88,Ponyo,8,13 August 2014,Adorable!,"Ponyo is a simple, cute little movie. Its as thought-provoking as you'd expect from a G-rated picture, but once in awhile, you just need an innocent, relaxing piece.Ponyo is a mixture of fantasy and slice-of-life. As others have said, its quite similar to Miyazaki's earlier work, My Neighbor Totoro. But instead of a giant raccoons-like spirit, our main kid befriends a fish girl! I'm not a fan of slice-of-life anime, but the characters in Ponyo did make me smile and chuckle. The fantasy elements under the sea are also beautiful, with a plethora of aquatic life, living, extinct, and fictional. Its pretty amazing. I also loved fish Ponyo and her sisters. Too. Freaking. Cute.The cast is surprisingly star-studded in the English dub. You can thank nepotism for Noah Cyrus and Frankie Jonas voicing our leads. But, honestly, it reaches the same quality as the rest of Ghibli's dubs. A surprisingly good match was Liam Neeson as Fujimoto. It just works out!Other than personal tastes, my biggest complaint was the ending. It was fine, but I wanted more! And that's a pretty good problem. ;) Its a great family film, and I can't imagine anyone hating it."
89,Ponyo,10,13 May 2014,It feels like a Children's Book in a life form,"I remember back in 2008 this film had gained some attention, I think because of the VA's that Disney had hired such as Liam Neeson and Matt Damon? However I wasn't interested in Anime at the time. Six years later I watched it as my sister has a copy of it to show it to her classroom for primary school. Watching the film I was amazed, as usual from Miyazaki, by the visuals and fluid motion of the characters movement. It doesn't feel like an anime it feels like a children's book that just jumped out from the pages and onto the screen. The film has some flaws here and there such as Sōsuke's mother leaving behind her own son and Ponyo at his home in a middle of a freakish storm. But the film is nice to watch and I think Miyazaki had done a decent job here. Liam Neeson was not even that bad in the film I had actually enjoyed his acting in the film and it has a message for kids during the movie about not polluting our waters."
90,Ponyo,,2 October 2013,Cute story,"I like this movie very much.I like ponyo. ponyo is cute. Ponyo saw Sota. Heroine is Ponyo. She is small. Ponyo play with Sota. Ponyo has many sibling. Then,Ponyo loves Sota.It was Cute.Ponyo saw many people. Ponyo and Sota were make friends. It is so good. I want to make friends Ponyo. Story is good. It is youth story. Ponyo is cute. Theme song is good. Singer is Nozomi Ohashi. She is good singer. Her voice is Cute. She is junior high school student.I was surprised. This movie is my favorite movie. I want to see the movie again. Ponyo is good movie for children.Ponyo's voice actor is Nozomi Ohashi.Other voice actors are good too."
91,Ponyo,8,27 September 2013,Great stuff!...,"Beautifully animated with all the style and grace of Miyazaki's work. It is distinctively his own and I hope nobody ever tries to copy it. I saw it in the 'Americanised' Disney version with some well known names in the cast. For me though, I feel it always loses something; I would have rather seen it with its original Japanese soundtrack. For some reason, that gives it a little more authenticity and also makes it a little more mystical. But the English language version was OK too with the likes of Cate Blanchett as Granmamere, Liam Neeson as Fujimoto, Tina Fey as Lisa, Matt Damon as Kôichi, Frankie Jonas as Sôsuke and (of course) Noah Lindsey Cyrus as Ponyo. They all did a pretty good job. I very much liked to music by Joe Hisaishi as well, it has a great feel to it and fits the visuals really well. Over all, although I'm far from the target audience, I have to say I really enjoyed this engaging mystical tale. Maybe one for a very young audience, which proves I must be young at heart, but certainly a worthy watch.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.2/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
92,Ponyo,8,14 August 2013,A bizarre and surprising yet cute and stunning offering from Miyazaki,"I already own four of Miyazaki's masterpieces on DVD ('My Neighbour Totoro,' 'Kiki's Delivery Service,' 'Howl's Moving Castle' and 'Spirited Away') and the Nostalgia Critic's 200th review of this film prompted me to watch this. While he praises the animation, visuals, memorable characters and creativity, he criticises Lisa's reckless driving and Ponyo's craving for ham. I agree with the critic in terms of the animation and visuals, but I have some gripes of my own for this film.Beginning with those gripes, one of them was the abrupt ending where Ponyo just simply kisses Sosuke and turns back into a human. The other was that the film was a bit overlong with a somewhat uneven pace. I also found the scene where Ponyo stares at a baby boy and very soon runs towards him to rub her face against his to stop him crying overly bizarre. As for the surprising aspects of this film, I thought Ponyo was a boy when I first heard of this as well as her voice actress Noah Cyrus (Miley's younger sister) but they are, in fact, girls. I also thought the 'Ponyo, Ponyo, Ponyo, fishy in the sea' song would be at the beginning (since it played over the title card in the Nostalgia Critic's review) but it actually plays at the end. It is a catchy and memorable song nonetheless. The other surprising thing I noticed was that I thought the Nostalgia Critic had actually added the subtitles of ""Bug off"" when Lisa angrily signals her husband a light message but it was actually part of the film. I found a couple of the characters unintentionally derivative since Fujimoto looks a little like David Bowie's character in 'Labyrinth' and Kumiko looked like a younger version of Kiki.Now I will move on to the positives. Sosuke and Ponyo are cute with good chemistry between them and there are some clever ideas such as Ponyo enlarging Souske's toy boat so that it is big enough for them to sail and Ponyo's observation of water coming from Souske's eyes when he is crying. I found some of the visuals stunning such as the appearance of Granmamare, the scene where the tsunami begins to break out with all the fish moving along with the waves and the slow-motion scene towards the end where Sosuke jumps towards one of the elderly women from the retirement centre and the water in the bucket splashes in her face. I also found the scenes where Ponyo spits water at various characters very funny. The musical score was charming, powerful and effective as well while the English-language voice cast is mostly well-known.All in all, this is a cute and stunning film if some of its aspects are on the bizarre side. 8/10."
93,Ponyo,8,29 June 2013,Quick and Short mini-review,"Miyazaki was challenged by someone to make another movie with the true poignancy and magic that was captured in Totoro. By most accounts he has done just that. While not my absolute favorite Ghibli movie, this is certainly one of the better ones. The story tends to be a bit slower even than most other Ghibli movies, but as a whole it certainly doesn't plod or drag its proverbial heels, it just pleasantly takes its time. It follows a little goldfish-like girl thing called Ponyo and her sudden transformation into a human after tasting human blood accidentally while healing a cut on a little boy named Sosuke's finger. The turning point in the story is Ponyo's love of Sosuke and how that threatens to not only change her life permanently, but also the world at large. There is much to be seen with this movie's fantastic visual style, slightly different from previous Ghibli offerings with more pastels and simple shading. Wholly recommended to everyone, this is one of the Ghibli movies that you have to see."
94,Ponyo,8,21 May 2013,A beautiful anime again from Hayao Miyazaki,"""I'd let a fish lick me if it'd get me out of this wheelchair.""Studio Ghibli films have so far not disappointed me, always capturing my imagination, and warming my heart. This animated fairy tale influenced by the little mermaid story/mythology. this story follows a little boy named Sôsuke. Who finds a Goldfish by the shore, he names her Ponyo. But Ponyo is a princess who want to stay with Sôsuke and become human.The story is rather simple but effective. In-keeping with other themes i have noticed in Ghibli movies. About friendship a lot of times between humans and magical creatures, love especially innocent love. There is also a ecological message in here but it is not rammed down your throat due to how enthralling and magical the film is. Visually stunning and shows that 2D hand drawn animation still has a place in cinema.Things i did not like are Liam Neeson voicing the Fujimoto character. I'm a big Liam Neeson fan. But his voice did not suit the character, and took me a little out of the film, trying to figure who would have been a better choice. Also considering there is meant to be some danger to the entire world in the film, i never really felt any tension because of it.Watch this just for usual standard artwork that was ethereal, whimsical, and utterly charming. Which is expected from a Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki film. But also get taken in by the sweet natured story also."
95,Ponyo,7,10 April 2013,Great Colorful movie!,"This is a great heartwarming movie, without being too cheesy. This is just the second Miyazaki movie I have watched. It is definitely for a younger audience than ""Spirited Away"", but I still thoroughly enjoyed, being a 30-something.That is something I was amazed when finished watching the movie! I knew it was for kids, but kept my interest throughout the whole movie.Great colors! (some scenes were even a bit psychedelic!) - The chemistry between Sōsuke and Ponyo is great - My only problem was that Ponyo's constant yelling was a bit exasperating at times.Overall a great movie. Definitely among the top animation films, I've seen.Score (7)"
96,Ponyo,9,4 April 2013,Terrific Studio Ghibli movie,"Well, what can I say? I absolutely adored PONYO, Studio Ghibli's answer to THE LITTLE MERMAID, which takes the Disney cartoon and bypasses it in every way imaginable. This is a tremendously entertaining children's film made with real heart and imagination. Although there's an environmental message, it isn't shoved down the viewer's throat (like in PRINCESS MONONOKE) and despite copious sentimentality this is never saccharine sweet or sickening; it's just a really good film.The story is simple, straightforward and works all the better for being so: it's the tale of a goldfish called Ponyo who yearns to be human, and the young boy living on the coast who befriends her. Although there are journeys into a fantastic undersea kingdom, much of the film is set in the real world, where the human characters have to deal with the very real threats of tsunamis and the like.The animation is stunning, the characters are lovely and the story as a whole has a warm fuzzy glow to it. Yes, this is a kid's film through and through, but it's one I watched and loved as an adult. PONYO is my second favourite Ghibli movie, just behind GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES."
97,Ponyo,8,23 November 2012,"Judging from its standard, Really is Back to the Classics","Am proud that Studio Ghibli has ended the string of the declining standards in their movies during recent times, with this remarkable family-loving piece. Watching this really does remind me of what Studio Ghibli used to be good at, i.e. the wonderful touches from its classics such as My Neighbour totoro and Pom Poko.Don't you think that the style of this movie really look like it is made in the 80's? Not overdone, not flamboyant, but simplistic, with very traditional characters and character-study driven content, coupled with a setting filled with traditional lifestyle (a feature not seen in Spirited Away or Howls Moving Castle), and a joy to watch. Glad that Miyazaki finally got back on his feet."
98,Ponyo,9,25 October 2012,One of Miyazaki's weakest,"Miyazaki is the GOD of cinema, producing ultra-high quality films at a consistent pace since the 1980's. No other director has provided me with greater entertainment value. His last film, Ponyo, doesn't reach the heights of sublime art as Spirited Away and Mononoke reached, however, it still represents one of the finest, most enjoyable films of the year. Indeed, it is about equal to Wall-E in terms of quality, which is the best animated film ever made outside of Japan, but it is still of a lower standard than Miyazaki's previous films, which were, pretty much, insuperable in terms of quality: how long we would need to wait before someone makes another film of the same caliber of Spirited Away? Maybe 20- 30 years. So one should not expect another Spirited Away when watching this film, like one should not expect another Iliad when looking for a book to purchase. However, it was still perhaps one of the top 5 films of 2008."
99,Ponyo,8,12 August 2012,Filled with innocence.,"The film is again a feel good type from the Ghibli. All of their films have one inherent thing which is the innocence and love among the humans. It's been lost these days from films as well as in reality. They have done a wonderful job in here. Sauski is a little kid, just 5 years old (so you can understand how cute he must have been shown.) and lives with his mother. One day he found a fish which is very much like a human or to say that wants to be. The fish had magical power and there was a whole magical world beneath the sea from where she came. Things got ugly when her father didn't want her daughter to live with humans. In the latter part, all kinds of magical things kept happening and this means that you are in for a wonderful and thoughtful ride.PROS:As with many other films from the same studio, you will feel good after completing the film. Problems are there but not in the sense that some plot is there by some evil character. The magical part is shown brilliantly. Cuteness in the faces of the children is again at the best. You will love the characters for sure.CONS:The story was good but in the climax, I was expecting much better. The climax ended as if not much thought was given for it.MESSAGE: ""We all have Kindness in our hearts.""VERDICT: ""Recommended watch."""
100,Ponyo,8,13 April 2012,Ponyo,"From Studio Ghibli and director Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle), I recognised the title of this Japanese cartoon film from possibly seeing the poster or DVD, so I was keen to watch it. Basically five year old Sôsuke (Frankie Jonas) is the son of a sailor and lives a quiet life on a cliff next to the ocean with his mother Lisa (Tina Fey). A beautiful goldfish (Noah Lindsey Cyrus) is a sea goddess and the daughter of masterful wizard and Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), and she longs to live within the human world, and she steals some of her father's powers to do it. One fateful day Sôsuke finds the goldfish trapped in a bottle on the beach, he names her Ponyo, and they become very close, and her newfound powers enable her to transform into human form and fall for him. But she is unaware that using these powers in the human world has a dramatic effect and has created a dangerous imbalance in the world, where the moon has been brought closer to Earth and caused the tides to rise. While Fujimoto goes in search of his daughter to help get the world back to the way it should be, Sôsuke and Ponyo go to help the old people and Lisa at the retirement home, and they are also in search of Sôsuke's father Kôichi (Matt Damon). After many adventures with the magic being used, the children becoming closer, and ocean spirit and Ponyo's mother Granmamare (Cate Blanchett) restoring the waters, Fujimoto sees it in his heart to let Ponyo stay human and live in the world that she loves. Also starring Cloris Leachman as Noriko, Nine to Five's Lily Tomlin as Toki and Betty White as Yoshie. I can see that the story was definitely influenced by The Little Mermaid, but that's not a bad thing, it is only similar with the fish wanting to be human concept, the rest has original ideas with weird and wonderful creatures, the English cast of voicing stars is splendid, and of course the vivid colours and imaginative cartoon style we have seen before makes this a fantastic watch, a great animated fantasy adventure. Very good!"
101,Ponyo,,10 March 2012,Wow Ponya rules!,"For fans of Studio Ghibli films, you'll probably know what you're in for, as Miyazaki has yet another winner in his filmography, that will win new fans over. I'm embarrassed to say the least that I've so far watched only My Neighbour Totoro (eyes that pile of Ghibli DVDs) and love it to bits, but I guess this would serve as a final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated films that I would enjoy.Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuria) is a magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea, with her constant forays in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a peek. Nonetheless these ambitions do not bode well with her humanoid dad Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who harbours some hatred toward the human race for pollution, and briefly touching a subplot on environmental protection / revenge by Mother Nature as well. An accident one day sees Ponyo being washed ashore, and picked up by five year old boy Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) who lives on a house on the said cliff with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while dad Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mostly out to sea since he's a sailor. And you can expect some moments of throwback to the likes of The Little Mermaid, or Splash made for kids. Saying anything more would be to spoil the fun.The artwork here is still simply astounding even though it's in 2D glory, knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked on. There are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame, that you'll probably be game for repeated viewings just to spot them all. This definitely beats any 3D or CG animated production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity, and not only from the artwork department, but on its story too, despite complaints coming in that it took a leaf from the Hans Christian Andersen classic. While there are avenues to make this film extremely dark, it only suggested certain dark themes, but opted instead for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both kids and adults alike.At its core, its about love, that between the family members of Koichi, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. More so, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened Ponyo, and I tell you Ponyo herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of Bolt, WallE and Eve all hands down. Characterization here is top notch, and it's hard not to fall in love with Ponyo, in whichever form adopted, especially when she's such a playful being who doesn't hide her emotions - if she's upset with you, either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face! Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a definite shoo-in to my top films of this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure as hell going to make my way to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world brought to us by Hayao Miyazaki. Highly recommended film, so don't you go missing this on the big screen!"
102,Ponyo,9,6 March 2012,On the Religious Aspects of Ponyo,"On the surface, Ponyo is a cutesy film with the kind of whimsical flare we are accustomed to seeing when watching a work of Miyazaki. But underneath this lies many religious undertones that give a much fuller understanding to the film. Though the film is a take on Hans Christian Anderson's Little Mermaid story, I think it is safe to say the famous Danish author would be impressed by the Japanese story writer's take on his classic tale. Having said that, Miyazaki frequently supplies his movies with rich aspects of Japanese culture, not least of which is religion. To understand the religious aspect of Miyazaki's art, we have to understand that Shintoism is a major religion in Japan. It is best described as a spiritual religion, in that spirits and forms of what we would call magic are present in everything. This is poignant in discussing Ponyo for several reasons. For one, Ponyo is a sort of magical ""fish-girl"" and her father is a wizard. In being a wizard, Ponyo's father interacts with nature through magic (such as with waves, various marine life, etc...). This very much keeps up with Shintoism in that Shintos generally believe that certain spirits (or kamis) become manifested within nature. When we discover later in the film that Ponyo's mother is Granmamare, we get hit with even more religious symbolism. Granmamare is a water spirit, and she (like Ponyo's father) acts within nature and as a part of nature. However, when Sosuke's father sees her, he recognizes her as the Goddess of Mercy (or Guanyin). Guanyin is a Bodhisattva of the East Asian Buddhist tradition as well as a symbol of compassion among many Eastern religions. This again shows that Miyazaki has strong religious themes in his films in general. While this review is specifically for Ponyo, one could easily draw parallels to Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, and Spirited Away. A great deal more could be said on each of these topics."
103,Ponyo,10,13 February 2012,a movie that you will be talking about,this is a movie that you will be talking about for a very long time it is a outstanding Disney movie you will stand up and cheat for one of the greatest movies ever made Disney did a outstanding job on this animated classic you want believe what you will see it is a magical movie that you will be talking about for a very long time it should be a IMAX 3D movie this movie would make a perfect IMAX 3D movie it is a sweet and loving animated movie that will leave you up in tears it is a very sad movie but it is still a movie that you will enjoy it is a hart warming film that you will enjoy it is the perfect family film you will just stand up and cheat after this wonderful movie is over it is the best Disney movie ever created it is worth seeing i never saw a movie quite like this ever you will like this wonderful awesome amazing sweet heartwarming movie it is a Disney it is the best movie yeah everyone thuds movie is the best you will enjoy this movie have a outstanding day everyone
104,Ponyo,,12 February 2012,Trip,"Gentle. Nice. Impressive. A boy and his little world. A magic meeting and escape behind limits. A movie like a love declaration. Honest, shied, no complicated. About small things in skin of modern fairy tale. Victory of good and ecologist lights. Delicat drawing and balls of emotions. Slices from childhood universe and basic story. Result - charming adventure , magic mirror in which image of every day events has different colors but same soul. Friendship, sacrifice, little mermaid, apocalyptic accents, reminder of Geea as good fairy, wizard as damned genius, father far from family, links between people and nature are ingredients of this diaphanous trip to essence of reality. A seed for adults. Joy for children. A kind of parable for everybody."
105,Ponyo,8,12 October 2011,Charming and Truly Enjoyble,"There seem to be mixed review for this movie but for me I still very much enjoy the movie much more than I thought. Before this I didn't even know who Hayao Miyazaki is, but having seen his 4films in a row I must say I enjoy every single movie of his. It is simple, traditional and captivates the sense of wild imagination very well. Now I will try to catch every movie this man makes.I love this movie because of its simple yet complex storyline that I truly believe will enjoy by everyone (although I believe some people were disappointed because they expected too much from Miyazaki). The movie consists of the same theme about the environment that is in almost every movie of Miyazaki.I must say even though the movie might be in the traditional 2D cartoon it doesn't make the movie any less visually stunning. Actually, I truly love this movie because of this special effect of this hand draw like images. I love the imagination, the wave, the tsunami, fishes, and many more.This is also the first time I watch the Japanese movie in the English dubbed and surprisingly it workout quite well, it doesn't have that weird vibe like watching actual movie.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to everyone, especially if you are looking for the movie for the young one to watch. I'm more than sure they will love it.Recommendation: Yes  Worth every penny.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A)"
106,Ponyo,,20 September 2011,"Underwhelming for Miyazaki, but still a pleasant film","After 30+ years of filmmaking, we've come to expect a lot from Hayao Miyazaki. It is a shock when his animated adventures don't amaze and mystify us. When Miyazaki makes a less than extraordinary film it definitely shows, as is the case with the charming yet no superb Ponyo. Ponyo is about a young boy named Sosuke who finds a goldfish in the ocean one day. Little does he know, this goldfish, whom he names Ponyo, is actually the daughter of a powerful underwater wizard, and she has run away from home so that she can become human and live on land. Ponyo and Sosuke develop a loving and heartwarming relationship as the film progresses and by the end they learn what true friendship is all about.I guess my biggest issue with Ponyo is that I was just underwhelmed, which is pretty picky for a film that is still more of a spectacle than your average animated film. But on the Miyazaki scale of fantastical beauty it ranks fairly low. It is certainly imaginative and beautiful and there are some great moments of the film. It is no doubt a film brimming with creativity and wonder, because that is where Miyazaki always succeeds. He always manages to transport us to a fantastic new world full of excitement and mystifying beauty. The worlds he creates are full of magic and grandeur. Ponyo is the same way but at the same time it is a little too close to reality, having the entire film take place in a small Japanese town where most of the characters are real people. The magic of the film is unexplained and something we have to take for granted. There's no real problem with this, but the magic seems like more of a device to move the plot forward than something mystical and incredible like it's role in films like Spirited Away. But regardless, Ponyo is a beautifully imaginative film that entertains and is of a very high quality when it stands alone, without being compared to Miyazaki's far superior films.My opinion on Ponyo's storyline parallels my thoughts on its visual quality. It is plenty imaginative and has a lovely adorable charm to it, but it's not of the calibre I expect of Miyazaki. There are some very creative aspects in Miyazaki's formation of the story pertaining to things like the underwater wizard, the way he controls and utilizes his power over the sea to make the story more interesting, and the magical aspect of Ponyo herself. But when you boil it down the story is pretty straightforward and the way it progresses is fairly predictable. There is a particular moment about thirty to forty minutes from the end where the film lost some of its thunder by setting up the remainder of the story to be as easy and predictable as possible. Ponyo doesn't illicit many emotions and it doesn't really venture out into themes less simplistic than love and friendship. Also, it lacks a real villain and has a weak conflict that barely carries the story. These various problems don't make Ponyo a bad film, but I can't say that this is a fantastic film either.All that being said, I'm still glad I watched Ponyo. It is charming, pleasant, and entertaining enough. It has its problems, but not enough for me to call this a poor film. Miyazaki's love for storytelling, adventure, and fantasy still shines in this film, making it a much more engaging experience. Ponyo won't go down in history as a Miyazki classic, but it should still be watched by fans of the lovely genius."
107,Ponyo,8,17 March 2011,"Disney, go home","Sosuke, a five-year old Japanese boy living near the sea suddenly comes upon a strange-looking fish, and when they both enjoy each other's company so much, she soon becomes a young girl. But this upsets the way of things, resulting in a massive flood. This take on Hans Christian Andersen's much loved fairy(or should I say mermaid) tale is full of wonder over nature(as with much of Miyazaki's work), life, magic and this time, sea creatures. The animation is amazing, with astonishingly high level of detail. This is some of the most beautifully animated water you will ever see. The pastels surprisingly do not strain the eyes. The measure of cute, silly and sweet is through the roof, and it will be too much for some viewers. This is told at children's level, and the dialog is realistic. It is also exciting, fun and imaginative. While the ""learning to be human"" scenes aren't original, they get the job done. The score is great, and this builds mood smoothly. This is 95 minutes sans credits. The DVD comes with trailers for this and others by studio Ghibli. I recommend this to fans of Animé. 8/10"
108,Ponyo,,7 March 2011,Ponyo wants ham!,"Master animator Hayao Miyazaki directs ""Ponyo"", one of his weakest films. It offers the usual Miyazaki environmentalism  a little boy's love for a goldfish prevents a kind of apocalyptic climate change  but all nuance is ejected and the film's characters never behave in any believable way.Still, ""Ponyo"" contains some marvellous atmosphere, scenery and at least four great sequences. These include a boy's brave boat-trek across a flooded island, a cliff-top car ride, and a pair of beautiful sequences involving giant ships, which spend the film lazily drifting across horizons. Unfortunately these moments of beauty, grace and poetry are undermined by a grating plot, a horrendous ending, generic light shows and much forced sentimentality, in which the ""power of inter-species love saves the world"".7.9/10  Along with ""Howl's Moving Castle"", this is the weakest of Miyazaki's films. Worth one viewing."
109,Ponyo,9,30 December 2010,"super cute, but not quite as good as I would have expected from Miyazaki","Being a huge fan of former masterpieces like ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"", I had really high expectations, and was a bit disappointed, unfortunately.But lets first comment on the good features of this movie. The animation and the artwork is as brilliant and stunning as you would have expected from a Miyazaki movie. Ponyo's cuteness is mind-blowing, and you will fall in love with her the first second. The soundtrack is also excellent, and a perfect fit.So, what is missing? Well, since the cast of characters in the movie is quite small compared to other animes, I would have expected to be able to form an intense bond with all of them, not only Ponyo and Sosuke. Which was not really possible, since they lack personality and intensity. Ponyo's father, for example, should have been presented a bit darker, since he is the ""villain"" after all. Don't't get me wrong, I don't think that he should have been characterized as the bad guy, but rather his concern for Ponyo seems a bit too shallow. Sosuke's mother is stereotypically nice and caring, really sympathetic, but that's all. Sosuke's father is reduced to a dummy with only some few seconds screen time.That's the flaw, I think: Most characters in the story merely fulfill their function (being concerned, being caring, being absent, ...), but don't have enough soul that you can really relate to them. Maybe this is deliberate, since the story focuses on Ponyo and Sosuke, but I had the feeling that something was missing, though.The ending was also a little bit disappointing for me, in terms of the pace of storytelling. Until the very last moments the story runs quite slow and gets lost a bit in beautiful yet longish day-dream like scenes with some dramatic cuts now and then. And suddenly there are only a few minutes left to go, and lots of unresolved issues. Therefore it gets quite hectic when they try to tie up all loose ends in the last minutes.Well, some minor flaws in an otherwise excellent and nearly indescribable beautiful movie. I would rate it 10, but I hold a production from Miyazaki to higher standards, I guess. Definitely worth watching with your whole family, if only for the perfect hand-drawn animation, which excuses any hole in the plot."
110,Ponyo,7,29 December 2010,It's really not that bad,"After seeing this film i knew it was going to be well done, unfortunately a lot of people attempt to be so hardcore by judging the voice acting, which isn't bad at all! As a matter of fact the only voice people are picking on is Ponyo's mainly because it's Miley Cyrus's sister. Granted I am not a fan of her, but I don't think of her as untalented, and just because this girl is Miley's sister, doesn't give anyone the right to judge her as if the whole family should be frowned upon. This girl definitely has talent, especially at the age she is, and from what I hear, voice acting is even more difficult than regular. All I'm saying is keep an open mind, ignore the fact she shares the same name as some one else, and enjoy the movie for what it's worth."
111,Ponyo,10,21 December 2010,Safe Shores with the Beautiful PONYO,"Hayao Miyazaki's incredible ""Ponyo"" -- mistakingly thought by some reviewers/people to be ""a children's movie, is-- in the opinion of yours truly-- anything but.Yes, definitely. Children will enjoy it. Very-very much, deservedly so. But, moreover, the 'children in Heart' among us adults, will enjoy it just as much as the Loving children in our lives.There's so much more than meets the eye, in this, Hayao Miyazaki's wonderful supernatural tale.Loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's famous ""The little Mermaid""-- Miyazaki's amazingly entertaining film tells of a defiant and irresistibly cute gold-fish-- named ""PONYO""-- who yearns to become human, and escapes from her magical kingdom under the sea-- only to come across a young 5 year old Human boy, who has much in common with her, when it comes to the realms of Faith, Love and imagination.Of course, Love, upgraded from friendship, between the two ensues, while events lead to a trigger being activated which threatens the very existence of Ponyo's and Suske's different worlds... and the delicate balance, holding the two worlds together safely.Containing beautiful and depth-full characters, A heartfelt and touching multi-meaning story, wonderful animation and an inspiration to tug the Hearts of both young and older... ""Ponyo"" will remind you that Love transcends the boundaries of worlds... has no age, and for those who believe in it, in spite of all, is contained within the assurance of being guided, in Love and caring, unto safe shores.PONYO is one of my most favorite of Miyazaki's films! If not the most favorite of them all!"
112,Ponyo,9,9 November 2010,MYeah's review: Ponyo,"Ponyo (Voiced by Noah Cyrus) is a tiny goldfish with a very strict magical father (Voiced by Liam Neeson). One day, she eludes his sight and travels to the human world, and is picked up by a boy named Susuke (Voiced by Frankie Jonas (It's a Disney movie), and after a series of events that I'd sound crazy trying to describe, starts to transform into a human herself, which sets the balance of the world in improper order, starting massive tidal waves, and devastating floods.The movie is written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, a man who has established himself as an ambitious auteur, directing films like the incredibly received Spirited Away, and Ponyo is no black sheep to his filmography, delivering a highly original plot. Not only does he inject appropriate doses of his signature humor, emotional heart, and themes of childlike innocence into the plot, but he crafts it astonishingly well. The backgrounds, the characters, and foregrounds have all been designed, and put in motion perfectly by he and his crew.The English dub is a star packed spectacle, featuring the talents of Liam Neeson, Tina Fey, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Betty White. Frankie Jonas does a great job as Sasuke, and Noah Cyrus is good, but sometimes her performance can seem a little too over the top. The voice performances are not always perfect, sometimes the delivery seems too rushed, and the dialogue occasionally has a little too much exposition, but I'd blame the American translators for that before I'd blame the actors. There's also a particular over reliance on Joe Hisaishi's score, which is often quite lovely and nothing but appropriate, but at times can feel a little too loud.Still, Ponyo is a sweet, humorous, ambitious, and honest movie that deserves to be seen, and maybe seen again, and have all imperfections (What few there are) simply ignored.I give Ponyo ***1/2 out of ****"
113,Ponyo,9,24 October 2010,"Think ""The Little Mermaid"" remade by Japan","I have a lot of respect for Japanese animation. I think the animation in them is amazing and the stories they tell are usually brilliant. Here is a film called Ponyo and while not as beautiful as some of the directors other works it shows how is an amazing creator of animated films and earn my respect. As you can expect from this film if have seen the other works of Hayao Miyazaki then you know just how brilliant the animation is. If you haven't them prepare to be amazed. As for the story it is filled with wonder. The characters are nice, and the plot is magical. I only had two problems with the film that stopped me from giving 4 stars. The first problem is that Ponyo gets annoying at times. I still love her character, but I think the screaming could have been less of an issue. Then the biggest flaw of this movie is that it is way to short. ""Sprited Away"" had a perfect runtime. 2 hours is a great amount of time that allows the viewer to be pulled to the magical world and never get bored of it. In this case it felt way to short. Before I knew it the movie was over. The ending feels like it will last a few minutes, but it ends up ending in the middle of when it should have been continuing. It feels like a film that is missing a few scenes. Other than that this film is sure to amaze you in many ways.3 and a 1/2 stars out of 4"
114,Ponyo,10,19 September 2010,A delight for young children and adults alike.,"To date the films of director Hayao Miyazaki have not disappointed me and 'Ponyo' is no exception. While this film as aimed at younger children it is a delight for adults too, transporting them to a magical childhood world. Ponyo is a goldfish who one day swims out to explore the sea around her home, as a trawler approaches she gets trapped in a jar that was amongst the rubbish it dragged up from the seabed. Even in the jar she manages to swim to the shore where Susuke rescues her. He puts her in a bucket and takes her to school and also shows her to the ladies at the old folks' home where her mother works. One of the ladies is shocked to see a fish with a face and warns that it is an omen of an impending tsunami. When Susuke goes down to the shore again a large wave washes Ponyo away and he thinks he has lost her. She has other ideas and manages to escape from her father again, summoning a giant wave to transport her back to Susuke. Something else has changed too Ponyo is now a little girl! Transformed by the potions made by her father, a wizard who has abandoned life on land to live under the sea. He is desperate to get her back and in searching for her causes a huge flood that covers most of the town. Luckily Susuke's house is at the top of a cliff so he is all right, he is however worried for his mother Lisa who attempted to drive to the old people's home. With the help of Ponyo's magical powers they set off to find her and to face a test which will decide whether Ponyo can remain human.This film was an utter delight from start to finish, possibly the most delightful Studio Ghibli film since 'My Neighbour Totoro'. The animation was stunning throughout, although it did have a slightly different style to previous films. The story was such that very small children could probably follow it as well as enjoying the visuals. There were plenty of laughs to be had along the way such as when Ponyo the Goldfish ate the ham out of Susuke's sandwich and his mother's somewhat reckless driving.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles."
115,Ponyo,8,2 August 2010,"Though one might argue for the case of earnest simplicity against a muddled complicated mess, Ponyo is still a film that could have lived up to its potential.","Ponyo On The Cliff By The Sea is distinctively the brushstroke of legendary Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. However, there are increasing signs that this brushstroke is slowly ageing and losing its potency. Miyazaki can still manage to compel viewers with his artistry, but he is clearly past his peak with this one. Ponyo is a lesser film by his standards; it reminds me of My Neighbor Totoro (1988) than say, Princess Mononoke (1997). In any case, Ponyo is one of his less impressive features to date. And if I may add insult to injury, Disney's Bolt is comparatively better.Strangely, I can find nothing wrong whatsoever with the plot. The film is loosely based on the story of the Little Mermaid. Here it is the little Ponyo, a goldfish-like creature with magical powers who yearns to become human (which is taboo-speak in her homeland under the sea) after a street-wise boy, Sosuke, saves her from being stuck in a jar. Here the protagonist is Sosuke, a strong departure from feminine lead characters as seen in past works such as Kiki's Delivery Service (1989) and Spirited Away (2001). Because of Ponyo's resilience to become human, she sets off a chain of events that threaten to overturn the balance of water and land on the planet.Viewers with a keen eye for subliminal messages will note that Miyazaki's fantastical tale of the sea is also a film that ridicules humans' ignorance towards sea pollution and its environmental consequences. Despite its flaws, Ponyo On The Cliff By The Sea has its fair share of 'Miyazaki moments' - Ponyo running atop large waves that make weird, quirky sounds, and an early scene where Ponyo's hundreds of tiny siblings fill the entire screen in a sea of pink. In addition, Joe Hisaishi's score is still consistently remarkable with a catchy, joyful theme song that brings back memories of a similar-sounding song from My Neighbor Totoro.Fans looking for an otherworldly epic adventure in the mould of Spirited Away will be disappointed. Here, the scope of the story is unexpectedly narrow; it is fundamentally a simple tale of love and acceptance. The first third of the film actually sets it up to be potentially intriguing. Alas, the lack of a genuine nemesis or a figure of pure evil means that the film takes a less adventurous and ultimately, a less complex and satisfying route. Though one might argue for the case of earnest simplicity against a muddled complicated mess, Ponyo is still a film that could have lived up to its potential. Yes, simple is good. But this is simple and not quite good enough by the director's standards.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
116,Ponyo,7,18 April 2010,"Not one of my favorite Miyazaki movie, but still a magical experience","This is probably a Miyazaki film that is more leaning towards the kids, not saying his other movies wasn't but I personally think kids, will enjoy it more than adults compared to his previous works. This is also Miyazaki's more down to earth animated movie compared to his previous work as well, despite the relationship with a fish girl and a 5 yr old boy. Anyways Miyazaki has yet again produced another magical film experience for the audiences, and the art work is very well done although you know it's a animated film the movements of the characters are very life like, even compared to movies that use real life characters. Although it isn't one of my favorite Miyazaki movie, if your a fan of Studio Ghibli, it really is worth watching even if you are not a fan of Miyazaki movie this may not be a good start because I liked some of his previous films a bit better, but it still is a magical experience.7.8/10"
117,Ponyo,8,24 February 2010,Great animation and a quirky story. Perfect child movie.,"Hayao Miyazaki is a genius of animation, his films usually bringing complex stories, detailed animation and original stories. Ponyo is not an exception, although it did seem more child oriented than most of his movies. It's like a mermaid story on steroids, both in complexity and beauty, where the main characters are 5 year old children and the focus is on wonder and friendship rather than banal romantic stories with no basis.There was a lot of work visible in the environment animation. The sea is alive, fish are everywhere, there is magic that pervades everything. There is a catch, a choice between being a magical creature or a human. In the end, even if such a choice is made, it represents but a little part of the story.Bottom line: a beautiful film, but a simple story. Fun to watch for adults, I think a delight for smaller children. As expected, perfect animation."
118,Ponyo,8,31 January 2010,Finally I've Enjoyed a Miyazaki Film!,"After ""Spirited Away"" failed to interest me a few years back (I did not even finish the DVD), I was discouraged to try other works by known Japanese animation master, Hayao Miyazaki. But this time, good word of mouth had prodded me to try his latest work, ""Ponyo."" I went to watch it without any preconceived notion what it was about, and I think the unfolding surprises were what drew me into this childhood fantasy film.The title character Ponyo is a half-fish, half-human entity. She escapes from her father's magical underwater den, and finds herself on land, making friends with a precocious five-year old boy Sosuke and his mother Lisa (whom I later found out was so sprightly voiced by Ms. Tina Fey). It is a whimsical tale of friendship and loyalty, filled with the innocence and wonder of children. While the script is simple enough for very young kids, adults will also enjoy the delightful ride.From the get-go, you know that ""Ponyo"" is different from the typical Hollywood Pixar and Disney output. The colors are pleasantly pastel, using watercolors to maximize aesthetic appeal to the artwork. However, the depiction of the wrathful power of the oceans and its disastrous effects do not lose their intensity. The character of the boy Sosuke is so well-written, well-executed, and well, cute. He reminded me so much of my youngest boy, who also enjoyed watching this with me.Because of this charming film, I will definitely be giving ""Spirited Away"" and the other Miyazaki films another try. Now that I have been introduced to his unique style of animation by this piece and thoroughly enjoyed it, appreciation of his other renowned works will have been facilitated."
119,Ponyo,8,17 December 2009,Ponyo...Awesome.,Beautiful movie..... i just love it. This is a perfect example of animation and shows the high graphics are not required to make a perfect animation. The story visuals Original score were excellent...I hope it get nominated for Original score and best feature......Coraline and Ponyo are the best movies of 2009 (animations)... Up is also good but not that good.9/10....Hayao Miyazaki really knows how to make an animation... but ending of all his movies is pretty similar.I would recommend it to every one. and watch it with your family(if possible)
120,Ponyo,8,9 October 2009,"Not children only: Treat yourself to a magically delightful adventure with Sosuke and Ponyo - from the imaginative creation of Hayao Miyazaki, adults inclusive","""Ponyo"" (2008) aka 'Ponyo on the Cliff'. It's an amazing narrative in lively endearing animation. Yes, the scenes of the stormy weather and rising huge wave crests are visually suspenseful (equal to any action movie sequence). Can that compact car make it? Lisa, Sosuke's Mom, is one gutsy woman, she is. Kudos to Hayao Miyazaki (writer, director, film editor, executive producer) at age sixty-seven (in 2008) being in such fantastic form, delivering a refreshing story for all ages to enjoy, always with the stamp of children kinship, family warmth and humankind values.Music is by regular Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi - but with this extraordinary fairy tale setting of the family of man and fish, you may not detect familiar Hisaishi strains or refrains but a mood-specific and plot-enhancing venturesome score. What a fabulous opportunity to do something different yet suits ""Ponyo"" storyline utterly.Did you say you don't usually see animated films? Let ""Ponyo"" be an excuse to enjoy an animated feature. You will feel wonderful having seen it. It's universal (and global - earth, sea and sky) for young and old, and older! Parents, grandparents or not, ""Ponyo"" is satisfying for all. Take a dose of magical liveliness and appreciate ""Ponyo."" Voice talents in English include: Tina Fey is Sosuke's Mom Lisa - an assertive woman exuding unabashed confidence in her actions as mother, wife, exemplary peer and rescuer to a community in distress. Frankie Jonas is Sosuke - the most friendly 5-year old little boy, sunshine to the old ladies, tender to a fish in his pail. Noah Cyrus is Ponyo - the spunky dauntless little fish-princess who's attracted to Sosuke and dreams of being his pal. Liam Neeson is Ponyo's long-hair scientist father Fujimoto, who desperately cares for Ponyo and anxious about his discoveries. Cate Blanchett is Ponyo's lovely caring mother 'Gran Mamare' (sea goddess), who bestows serenity and enchanting solutions in all aspects. Matt Damon is Sosuke's Dad Koichi who's constantly out at sea away from home. For over-sixties inclusive we have Lili Tomlin, Cloris Leachman, Betty White - the old ladies at the old folks home next to Sosuke's school (at times reminiscent of touches of 'Cocoon' 1985). Colorful characters, beautiful story. Heart-warming, magical, vivid animation. A fascinating film experience highly recommended for all ages."
121,Ponyo,8,8 September 2009,Another amazing Miyazaki film..but not his greatest,"I finally went out and saw the dubbed version of this on the big screen. For the dub, having seen the original version of it with subs, the dub is watchable. Little kids watching this aren't going to know the difference.Onto the movie...I was super excited about seeing this, and after I saw it...I kind of had mixed feelings about it.One has to realize its target audience is obviously little children..so its more of a light and fluffy story like Totoro, but even then, a movie can be made for children but still enjoyed by adults...this film didn't quite do that.Don't get me wrong, the story was nice...little girl fish wants to become a human and falls in love with a little boy. It definitely has its magical moments but it is no way on the same level as Miyazaki's more recent work, Spirited Away or Howl's Flying Castle, nor is Ponyo's story as deep as those two. Not that it needed to be super deep, but, I dunno, the whole story just felt lacking in some parts. Also some of the characters were a tad...shallow.Ponyo shows that she has magical powers and can do incredible things, but her character is just a silly cute little girl-fish obsessed with ham. Sosuke tries to be a mature, responsible little adult, which is put across pretty well. The mother was done well enough but in some part with her it was a bit ""ehh..."" halfway through the movie we learn that in order for the world to be saved Sosuke must prove his love to Ponyo, but besides trying to get her to safety after she starts losing her powers and then declaring his love for her to Ponyo's mother. Nothing else really special happens; there is no big finish. Although I suppose one could argue it wasn't necessary *shrug* As for the appearance/animation of the film...the animation was definitely not as good as what you see in some of the other films which was a little disappointing. It was kind of odd...all the aquatic stuff, everything in the ocean, all the ocean critters, the water, was all done beautifully. The opening scene was amazing and the scene where the tsunami starts and Ponyo is running on the giant fish made me tear up because it was such a gorgeous animation sequence, all the parts with the Goddess was fantastic, and the Goddess herself looked incredible, Fujimoto was done pretty well too yet the other character animation wasn't super-great...and in some scenes it was pretty bad. Plus many of the characters were super simplified. Like the old women. When you look at Howl's Flying Castle and see the Witch of the Waste when she is a old lady and then look at the old ladies in Ponyo you're just like ""huh?"" also, with the backgrounds, specially in the city there isn't as much attention to detail. Some backgrounds look like they were hastily colored. Maybe this was the design they wanted but I dunno...Its just...one would think with this being the most recent film all the animation and appearance of everything else would be more improved than the last film, but with this film its like it took a couple steps back..So, in conclusion, the movie is pretty good but nowhere as good as some of Miyazaki's older work. I heard a rumor that Hayao Miyazaki's son directed the film yet its Hayao's name in the credits, so I dunno about that.as a huge fan of Miyazaki's work I still enjoyed this very much. It's was a little disappointing in some aspects, but still a great film nevertheless."
122,Ponyo,8,8 September 2009,Another Wonderful Miyazaki Treat,"A wonderful traditionally animated film that is suitable for everyone including children from writer and director Hayao Miyazaki who was also responsible for ""Spirited Away"" (winner of an Oscar for Best Animated Feature), ""Princess Mononke"", ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"" amongst others.Ponyo is the story of a 5 year old boy Sosuke who rescues and befriends a goldfish princess who has magical powers, following their meeting she longs to be human despite the dire consequences foretold by her father.The host of talent attracted to the English adaptations of his films is testament to his incredible film contributions, for Ponyo the English voice cast included; Cate Blanchett, Matt Damon, Liam Neeson, Tina Fey, Cloris Leachman, Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Further the script adaptation was handled by Melissa Mathison and the producers included Kathleen Kennedy and John Lasseter served as Executive Producer.As with virtually all of Miyazaki's films we get an ecological message, in this case the message is not surprisingly man's pollution of the oceans and our overall disrespect for nature, except for one short sequence the message is not emphasized and its also a message that is hard to really disagree with.Although definitely suitable for all ages there is a storm sequence in the film might be a little frightening to some young children but I don't really think there is anything that would prevent a child from enjoying this film.The hand drawn water colour and pastel like animation seemed very simple at first but once you are drawn into the story it seems quite appropriate and it is also artistically very beautiful if not quite as realistic as the approach he has taken in some of his other films."
123,Ponyo,8,31 August 2009,Fairytale magic of Ponyo,"Hayao Miyazaki has gone back to his roots and delivered a delightful animated tale that follows other Miyazaki classics like My Neighbor Tototro and Kiki's Delivery Service. Miyazaki again explores the battle between nature and industry and sends his not too subtle message that humanity must discover a balance or else suffer dire consequences to their acts of pollution. However, this message is but a sub-plot to the central interaction between Ponyo (the goldfish princess) and her desire to be with a human boy named Sousuke. Compared to Miyazaki's more adult animated fare such as Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind which delves more directly into Miyazaki's mindset of humanity's destruction of nature, this movie is aimed squarely at children but any adult should also connect with giggles and smiles at how accurately Miyazaki captures the actions of children.One point of interest I found was this movie has a very different look compared to previous Miyazaki films. Instead of the clean lines and precise imagery used in his other movies, Miyazaki has explored a new look that can be best described as a mix of crayon and water color brush art. This was unexpected but gradually I found the landscapes and seaside town settings stunning as the main characters moved about their daily lives. Children will love the rainbow like colors used and Miyazaki masterfully uses these backdrops to emphasize the key characters; the stunningly clear depiction of the sea-goddess is a case in point and her appearance lifts the imagination to a level that can be best described as a magical.The film focuses primarily on Ponyo and Sousuke, which is both a blessing and a curse as the plot could have evolved to a much deeper level (for adults anyway) had there been more exploration into Fujimoto (Ponyo's father) and Koichi (Sousuke's father). Fujimoto especially is a fascinating character and he steals the scene whenever he appears, I found myself laughing and intrigued by his actions and I couldn't help wonder if Fujimoto was a somewhat animated version of Hayao Miyazaki himself. It was a pity that one of this film's protagonists received so little screen-time. However, the director balances the other supporting cast masterfully, from the elderly women who wish to live life more to Sousuke's sister Lisa and even the sea-goddess herself, Guranmamare show just enough of themselves for you to understand their characters.I saw the traditional Japanese voiced film with English subtitles so I can't comment on the star-studded English dubbed version that has also been released. With voices such as Cate Blanchett, Liam Neeson, Matt Damon, Tina Fey and Lily Tomlin lining up, I'm sure the English dubbed interpretation would've attempted to do justice to the film. Nevertheless, I have always been one to prefer watching Miyazaki films as they were intended with Japanese voices.All in all, a children's tale with a children's story ending (keep that in mind for all those adults who may find the wrap up a tad contrite). Delightful and innocent and refreshing during this day and age where much of animated shows (such as Shrek and The Simpsons) have lost such innocence."
124,Ponyo,8,29 August 2009,A beautiful film that demands to be watched on the big screen,"Ponyo is a story of a boy who finds a fish in a jar almost watched up on sea named Ponyo, and how his love for Ponyo will decide the fate of mankind. Liam Neeson does a great job as Fujimoto, Ponyo's undersea father trying to get her back to save all of mankind. Ponyo is the rare family film (and a type of one we got a couple of other times this year), and that type of film is a film both kids and adults will love. Both kids and adults will love the bright colors and cool visual effects. Although, both kids and adults will find themselves bored for about the last 20 minutes of the film. This particular part of the film tended to drag on, and on, and on, and on. That said, it doesn't mean the movie's bad. It's still definitely worth seeing. This just means it's not a perfect family film like Up. Yes, it pains me to complain about anything having to do with Hayao Miyazaki's films, but even me, a huge fan of Miyazaki's, tended to find it boring towards the end. But the voices, not only by Liam Neeson, but by Matt Damon, Tina Fey, and Betty White among others are perfect, and the movie is more than visually stunning enough to capture both kid's and adult's imaginations. Definitely one worth checking out."
125,Ponyo,7,27 August 2009,Adorable!,"""Ponyo"", the latest film by master animation director Hayao Miyazaki, isn't a masterpiece like many of his other works but is still wonderful none the less. It is gorgeous (as usual), fantastic, touching and adorable.Based loosely on ""The Little Mermaid"", it's the story of a young fish-like creature who meets a small boy, falls in love with him, and decides she wants to be human. There's more to it than that, but I'll leave it at that because I don't want to give too much away.The animation is just beautiful. It has the brightest, most vibrant colors you'll see outside of a child's picture book and many of the characters have an eye catching design.I also need to give credit to Joe Hiashi and his score. Hiashi's music is almost every Studio Ghibi movie and is great. Here, he's at his best. I found the music soothing, soaring, or stirring, depending on the scene.There's a colorful cast of characters, from the title character (cute both as fish and as human), to Souske, the boy she meets who grows up a little as the movie goes along to their families, including Ponyo's hundreds of little (and I do mean little) sisters and wizard father, who looks like a cross between an 80s rock star and a clown.If the film has a flaw, it's that there's a lack of conflict and suspense. Even ""My Neighor Totoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" manages to give their characters some big problems to deal with. Here, when something goes wrong, it's solved rather quickly. Maybe a little TOO quickly...Also, the movie peaks part way through. There's a wonderful scene with Ponyo running on the ocean waves during a storm after she's turned human while Souske and his mom drive up drive up a cliff side road to get away from the waves that is just exhilarating and marvelous. But after that, things start to go downhill and the movie slowly runs out of steam until the end.""Ponyo"" is not a classic masterpiece of animation like ""Spirited Away"" or ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and I'm not even gonna bother comparing it to ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" and ""Princess Mononoke"" if just because it's so different in style and tone. But it's still a Hayao Miyazaki movie. And that means an animated film that is beautiful and moving."
126,Ponyo,7,23 August 2009,Ponyo is colorfully lovely....,"Hayao Miyazaki, the talented director who brought us the Oscar nominated Howl's Moving Castle, has hit another solid effort with his latest, Ponyo. With breathtaking animation, Miyazaki has shown US audiences that regular animation is still a good sell and can still find its way into the viewer's heart.The film tells the story of Ponyo, a young-ling from the ocean who ventures out and falls in love with young Sosuke (Frankie Jonas), an adventurous five year old with responsibility and strong desire for life. Things turn a bit sour when Ponyo's father (Liam Neeson), goes to search for his daughter and turns the town upside down.Without giving anything away, Ponyo has great pace, colors, and character quality but where Miyazaki conquers on those tasks, he fails in a lazy and thoughtless ending. In those final twenty minutes, Miyazaki loses all credibility we had with Ponyo and loses its audience with unanswered questions and quick anecdotes.The great thing about the piece is Miyazaki throws us into a story of love, youth, and innocence. Capturing something missed from youth, Ponyo reminds us of the beauty of life and love and in the smallest and unique places; we can enjoy and find these things. Ponyo is still a must-see for any animated film lover and enchants even the darkest of souls."
127,Ponyo,8,23 August 2009,Worthy addition to Ghibli and Miyazaki's filmography,"Many have called this a ""lesser"" work of the master. I prefer ""familiar;"" Miyazaki's staples are everywhere, such as a child protagonist and some light environmental messages (though his signature motif, flight, is notably absent). So Ponyo is pretty much business as usual with Studio Ghibli. Business as usual that is, with one of the most consistently creative and charming film studios in the world. Expect beautiful animation (here traditionally hand-drawn), endless expression, and a whimsical romp through the glowing eyes of youth.Some will find the story simplistic and pointless, but those with an eye for nuance will see Miyazaki's gift for situation and presence on par with his masterful My Neighbor Totoro. I responded best to scenes reminiscent of my own childhood (and others of theirs I'm sure), for instance the respective feather-ruffling of parents or the excitement of exploring a new friend's home. Both were nostalgic illustrations of particular instances I had long forgotten, and am now glad to remember. Because of this focus more still will miss the sweeping epicness of say Laputa or Mononoke, however they will also miss the point. This is thoroughly a family film, its themes paternal and its conflicts relative. See it with your family. Grab some kids and join their wide-eyed ranks for 90 minutes."
128,Ponyo,8,22 August 2009,"""Mom, Ponyo came back and she's a little girl now!""","Every young man should have a pet which turns into a girlfriend when he wants it to, and though Sosuke (Noah Lindsay Cyrus) is only five years old, his mom Lisa (Tina Fey) DOES call him ""the man of the house"" and leave him there all alone at one point in this cartoon feature. Speaking of wishful thinking, it is likely Hermione (Emma Watson) of Hogwart's fame would be far happier if she could just take the words of Ponyo's (Frankie Jonas) sea god father Fujimoto (Liam Neeson) as her guide: ""You can't be human and magic at the same time, sweetheart."" Some western film-goers may find it odd that the fate of Sosuke's village, if not the entire eastern hemisphere, depends upon two apparent five-year-olds hitting it off in a precociously chivalrous manner, but in the east there is cultural acceptance of arranged marriages at even younger ages (not to mention nuptial agreements for the pre-born), so only culturally insensitive reviewers will quibble about that. Normal parents will not worry at all about their own kindergartners being confused about these perhaps-not-seen-before social conventions, since the fantasy elements of PONYO will doubtless overwhelm any consideration of such domestic arrangements in the minds of their wee ones."
129,Ponyo,8,17 August 2009,Mesmerizing tale of the sea and love,"Ponyo surprised me.I don't doubt the people behind these great animated movies, it's just Ponyo sounded a bit too kid-friendly for me. Upon reading about it and seeing still-frames/conceptual artwork I was pretty convinced I wasn't going to be interested.I was wrong.Ponyo takes a simple approach to a simple tale. There are some obscure and advanced themes, like the whole 'well of the sea' and some of the more mystical attributes. The story is about a boy and a goldfish. A goldfish that wants to be a human girl.The artwork is pretty minimalist, but it's used in such a way to create some intense scenes. The sheer largeness of the ships around the harbor town setting made me a bit uneasy. The storm sequence is by far one of my favorite scenes in any movie up to date (as of now). Ponyo running across the water was too epic to be true.It was light in most parts, very few scenes with heavy content. This movie revels in it's own innocence from start to finish. When I have kids someday, they're going to be exposed to Ponyo pretty early on.Amazing, and amazingly campy."
130,Ponyo,8,14 August 2009,2nd Tier Miyazaki (but still worth seeking out),"If you're as big a fan of the animated fantasy films of Hayao Miyazaki as I am, you'll look as forward to this one as I did. In one sense, I am happy to report that 'Gake no ue no Ponyo' (or better known for it's U.S. distribution as just 'Ponyo')has a lot to offer. It does offer some nice animation (although nothing as lavish as his previous films,such as 'Howl's Moving Castle',or 'Spirited Away'),and a well written screenplay by Miyazaki,himself (loosly based on a story by Hans Christian Andersson),that does have a loose end,or two that could have been tightened up a bit. The American edition makes real good use of voice overs by the likes of Cate Blanchett,Liam Neeson,Matt Damon, and some solid support by Tina Fey,Cloris Leachman,Betty White,and even Lily Tomlin. The plot concerns a young boy,named Sosuke,who finds a special goldfish,with a human like face,who he names Ponyo,briefly becomes separated from her during a violent storm at sea,but is reunited,when Ponyo shape shifts into human form. It's up to Sosuke to muster up enough love in his heart to ensure that Ponyo becomes human, forever. Maybe not as heart touching as Miyazaki's previous offerings, but still worth a look,if you're as much into Anime & Manga as I am. Currently in release with English dubbing (although I'm sure the original Japanese edition can probably be found on the Japanese release DVD---check Ebay). Although rated 'G' by the MPAA,this film contains a few scary moments that may be a bit intense for very small children (no big surprise for Disney,who has always prided themselves on scaring the living bejesus out of young people)."
131,Ponyo,,18 July 2009,Let your imagination run wild,"This film is about the magical friendship between a five year old Japanese boy who lives by the sea, and a goldfish princess who possesses unearthly powers.""Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea"" is a very imaginative tale. There are so many visual surprises, such as waves turning into fish, transformation of Ponyo and the sea Goddess. These visual delights adds to the film's power to delight and entertain. The main characters, Sosuke and Ponyo are both adorable and pure, just like five year old children should be. They remind us what it is like to be a child again.""Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea"" brings our lost childhood and vivid imagination back. It is an enjoyable journey."
132,Ponyo,6,28 December 2013,"Spoilers. So yeah... Ponyo kind of sucks, but in a kind of good way.","Let's get the Hayao Miyazaki-staples out of the way. The animation is beautiful, the camera-angles are great, the characters are fun, and the humour is sufficient, and duh: You're never too old for a Ghibli movie.The characters are dumb. Really stupid; huge tidal wave that killed most of my crew, and there's a little girl leading too? ""She looks about my son's age!"". A huge wave that seems specifically aimed at your car.. and is? ""That wave is SO after us!"" A wave grows eyes and tries to eat you? ""That was weird."" It's so infuriating. Also, there's a tacked on plot about the end of the world. Isn't the budding friendship between two children - who share a sibling love - exploring each other's worlds enough? No. And the titular character's dad is planning to end the human race with a barrel of Mountain Dew.It would have been absolutely perfect if not for the blunt, deadpan characters who really don't care, or don't notice, about the dangerous things happening around them and their common - and very disturbing - disregard for human life, or the forced, completely pointless plot point of the world ending.Also, many people criticise the ending as ""Some 5 year old promising to not destroy the world isn't enough.. he's 5."" Firstly, Ponyo and Sosuke's relationship is much more of a sibling one; they're never shown to care about each other on a romantic level.. then again, they're five, and they seem very close, and they probably know that becoming romantically involved and their ensuing separation would probably destroy the world. So, that's all fine and dandy, and that criticism isn't justified.I also find it very disturbing that Lisa drives very irresponsibly and neglects her child - though leaving them at home during a very vicious storm may actually make sense, seeing as how nobody in this film makes any sense anyway - and later, another child, who may or may not happen to the be the princess of the sea.I want to rate it higher. But it's just not as good as Miyazaki's other efforts."
133,Ponyo,8,23 December 2013,A lesser Miyazaki film,"I've said this before, but I'm definitely sure about it here: I'll so be getting voted down for my opinion.I have seen almost all of Miyazaki's theatrical work, but Ponyo is severely lacking. Sure, it's full of beautiful backgrounds and gorgeous effects animation, but the story is all over the place and the characters, for all their quirks, unmemorable.Some would spit at me and say I just have too small a mind and too limited an attention span to appreciate the film, but I loved films even slower than this. My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service are slow films, but at least they have depth in addition to pretty visuals. I think Miyazaki was going for a theme about communication and family, but it just feels so shallow here.Happily, I can say this is the only Miyazaki picture I have been disappointed in thus far."
134,Ponyo,,12 February 2010,A great artist in the service of pink fluffiness,"Well, call me a grumpy old sod, but I found the new animated feature by Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki, who brought you Howl's Moving Castle, just a little too pink and fluffy for my taste.It's a marvelous piece of animation though, apart from the sketchy backgrounds, and crammed full of so much more life than you would expect in most hand-carved movies. It's loosely based on the story of the Little Mermaid. Ponyo is a tiny goldfish who escapes from the sea and befriends a little boy, Sosuke. Their friendship builds on Ponyo's desire to become a human, but her magic making to achieve this results in the sea rebelling against the land. The question is then: how to get the natural world back in balance, so that we can safely return to burning fossil fuels. Yes - that's how the tale is told - I'm not being an old cynic here.It's beyond being cute, though, and the American version adds to the sweetness by giving all voices a gloss of warm suburbia, and although the menacing sea is convincingly frightening, the overall feeling is of a world where everything will turn out for the best regardless. Not as Terry Gilliam would do it!Worth seeing, though, for the truly masterful artwork. Great stuff for the kids, although whoever you are I recommend leaving in haste before the slappy-happy end credit music. Hrrmph!"
135,Ponyo,10,23 August 2009,This movie was an excellent update to a classic.,"The film was an updated version of the classic story of The Little Mermaid, and it was beautiful in the sense that everyone in the film seems to accept that the magic of Ponyo and her family exists. I think that not a lot of animators take advantage of the suspension of disbelief that persists within this genre, but Miyazaki creates a world in which anything is possible and in doing so breaks the divide between animation and real life. In his doing so, we are sucked into that world, and so while I was watching Ponyo turn into a little girl, I completely believed that it could happen. The thing I loved about it was that the mother, Lisa, accepts it too! A lot of children's movies (like Return to Oz) put this barrier between adults and children that allows children to believe and adults to not believe (in whatever the movie happens to be promoting). Yet, Ponyo made it completely natural for magical things to happen and for everyone to accept them.Another thing I loved about the movie was the animation, which was drawn by hand. It has a softness and smoothness that Disney used to have before they discovered the use of computers. The attention to detail is astounding, and I found myself watching every inch of the screen so that I wouldn't miss anything. And I mean anything. The pictures are so fluid that upon watching I breathed a sigh of relief at not having to watch something created on a computer. It gets tiring, you know? It's nice to know that I'm looking at, well, art. Moving art, that is.The only thing that disconcerted me was the ending. It came too quickly, and you'll understand what I mean if you watch the movie. I won't give anything away, but I was expecting more conflict. I have read the original story of The Little Mermaid, and I was interested in seeing what direction this story would take."
136,Ponyo,10,22 August 2009,simple story but not TOO simple,"I saw 'Ponyo' twice, the first time to ""get"" the story plot, and the second time intending to just enjoy the animation washing over me (kinda like a stoner at a light-show:-). But the second time I got a surprise rather than what I intended - I wound up picking up a lot more details about the story plot! The first time I thought the ancient fishes and the close moon were interesting but anachronistic, and the goddess's comment about the ocean simply a throwaway. The second time I grasped the wizard's earlier comment about ""filling the well would restart a Devonian sea"", and realized everything followed logically. The first time I was distressed that Ponyo's appearance kept changing (feet or claws?, etc.) The second time I realized every one of Ponyo's shape shifts (not just the shrinking when the magic is eclipsed) fit into the story line.The North American voicing is fitted into the Japanese mouth movements extremely well; still the mismatch is somewhat noticeable (but not distracting). A few bits (ultra respect for elders, bowing, naming with -san) can be a little puzzling in this culture. And although high quality, the somewhat saccharine North American Disneyfication of the sound track doesn't quite match the depth of the visual fantasy. But overall, typical North American audiences will be pleased at just how accessible the movie has become. Hard core animation buffs and cross-cultural aficionados may want to get the Japanese DVD with English subtitles and put it in their region-free player though."
137,Ponyo,,10 August 2009,Cool storms,"""I have heard the mermaids singing each to each. I do not think that they will sing to me."" T.S. Eliot's Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.For Sosuke, they sing loud and clear.Because I never much cared for the sweetness of Disney's Little Mermaid, I was prepared for a sugar overload in Ponyo, a Japanese anime from acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki. Then I remembered how genuinely adorable his Princess Mononke is and how creative Howl's Moving Castle. In short, I was pleased with the startlingly imaginative animation in his Ponyo, with a roiling dark sea befitting Homer and flat characters that yet jump out of the screen with affection for each other and expressions both wildly off center and yet perfectly tuned to their love of nature and each other. The vivid colors add both depth to characterization and vitality to nature.The plotit amuses me, as it did with Wall-E and Eve, to have either children or robots expressing a purity of love we usually express only in poetry or song lyrics. Yes, Sosuke is just five, and his undersea love, Ponyo, is probably younger. Yet their love and respect for each other is exhilarating, Oh, yes, plot: in the best mythopoetic tradition, she wants to become human, much to the displeasure of her Prospero-like father but supported by her larger than life fairy mother, Gran Mamere. Sosuke's mother, Lisa, is an energetic do-gooder whose love for her son is memorable.While Dad seems conflicted about his powers and his affection for his many fish/children, the film has a way of making you see that this is the way many fathers are about their children. Such is Miyazaki's approach to imagination and realitythey co-exist in a mythical world of challenge, contradiction, and conciliation.You can guess what happens, but not after some cool storms."
138,Ponyo,6,9 October 2008,slightly disappointing,"i had very high hopes for this one, thinking that it very well could be his best work. i adore all of miyazaki's films, and i had heard comparisons to Totoro - maybe my favourite film of all time.the main problem is that i just didn't like ponyo's character. it's a huge flaw for me then, maybe she will grow on me after i see the film again, but for now i just found her annoying and not cute at all. you may call me shallow, but i really think the film would have been better if she was a bit older and a little cuter.i loved the wizard and i loved all the other arch typical ghibli characters. the waves were fantastic. i loved the litte house on top of the hill, and i loved the boats sailing by. the scene where the boy signals with morse code was brilliant, and the atmosphere was gloomy and calm.now, the music was in parts great, but for the most part it was too volumnious and pompus.all in all it was a classic miyazaki film with some flaws, it might grow on me, but for now it didn't match my expectations sadly."
139,Ponyo,6,23 June 2010,"Disappointing, but still fun","After watching Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, I had high expectations for another crazy imagination filled adventurous wonderland kind of story. I feel that this movie was kind of short. Im not sure if it was shorter in length than the other movies, but it was definitely shorter in content. The characters were cute.. (how could you say no to Ponyo's little grin?) but this movie did not immerse me into the ""world"" as much as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away did. If you want to watch this movie, don't watch it with high expectations of a great adventure story/plot development like I did. It wasn't nearly as creative as those other two movies I have watched by Miyazaki. This movie reminded me of a Japanese reimagining of The Little Mermaid. Been there done that; I don't want to watch another rendition of The Little Mermaid. This movie also seems more like a ""kid"" movie than Princess Mononoke (definitely) and Spirited Away. If you want a cutesy, fun movie, then this is the movie for you! If you are looking for more of an exciting adventure story, then try those other two movies. :P Enjoy!"
140,Ponyo,6,23 March 2010,Upbeat movie for the kids,"If you are going to watch this movie expecting the next Spirited Away, then prepare to be disappointed. Ponyo is a movie that is purely aimed at kids. The story is easy to follow, and kids can easily relate to the characters. That being said, this is the ideal movie to watch with your kid(s) on a boring Sunday-afternoon.For the rest this movie has the typical fairytale-like storytelling that you can expect from a movie by Hayao Miyazaki. There are no dark twists or anything though, instead Ponyo is a very upbeat movie from beginning to end. There are also no real villains in this movie.I would not recommend watching Ponyo by yourself because the story isn't really particularly interesting for adults. However, if you have kids then they will probably have a great time watching Ponyo."
141,Ponyo,7,17 February 2010,Weird,"I'm not unfamiliar with Studio Ghibli's offerings. I have watched and enjoyed Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle. The one thing they have in common is a profound sense of unfamiliarity - they exist in some sort of dream-like alternative world which, for full comprehension, assumes that I have a set of cultural reference, experiences and values which I simply don't. For all that I have enjoyed them, there is something about all of them which simply slips past me. They are weird.Ponyo is no exception. If I had to describe it, I would suggest imagining that Andersen's Little Mermaid and Collodi's Pinocchio had a love child. Then imagine that offspring was a merrily insane Japanese ecologist on an acid trip in a monsoon. That's Ponyo.Ponyo is a fish who wants to be a little girl. She is able to carry out magic and this is all tied in with the moon nearing the earth and pulling the tides out of whack. The only way the world can be saved is if Ponyo's human little boy friend will accept her as both fish and human.The animation is often less than sophisticated, but this doesn't matter because the design is wildly imaginative. There are sequences of great power and beauty and downright oddness. The high powered voice cast has been recruited for the English dub, and I'm afraid I thought they were not at their best. Liam Neeson was the only voice I recognised on hearing. The music is rather pleasing, and very western.In summary, always interesting, always entertaining, always weird."
142,Ponyo,10,28 July 2009,A Masterpiece,A beautiful work of art is what this movie is Ponyo it is the What the children should be watching instead of the filth on TV the animation the artwork the story line the emotions i rather this than any 3D animation any day people who say horrible to this should have there eyes taken out i saw the movie just now after waiting for it to arrive to me from japan and watching it gave me so much happiness made me feel like i was 10 again Ghibli studios has bin is and will always be better than WB FOX and all the animation companies out here in the U.S and a companie that know that is Disney.Hayao Miyazaki thank you for giving us the opportunity to see your wonderful creations.
143,Ponyo,,5 May 2009,sketchy,"Any simplistic approach to the work of Miyazaki will fall into a trap that per passes all his work. What he does is never the work of a childish mind or any kind of straightforwardness. The worlds he endlessly explores are deep because he paints them exquisitely, and provides us images as detailed and meaningful as we could expect.Here the textures are watered down by the will he had to give us a child product, in the best sense the concept may have. So, if the sets are mildly complex in their representation, all the characters are highly simplified, except for one remarkable character, Fujimoto. This one has the kind of textured treatment, in clothing, face, skin, details, of the most visually complex films of Hayao. Interestingly, he also plays a pivotal part in the story, as he mediates between earth and sea, mundane and divine. He is the wizard who evokes and binds things together, and joins different forces, a kind of Miyazaki on screen. These characters are, for their single presence, able to capture you for their undefined expressions, their ambiguity in what they express, as well as for their strange contexts and very nature, a bit like Paula Rêgo's characters, who belong to the same type of graphic characters as these ones.In this film we watch again Miyazaki halfway between east and west. His obvious fascination for western (artistic) values discusses its presence with his Japanese ability to create water coloured still, yet visceral, images. This is something with which he has lived all his career. Here, besides the obvious story connection, a variation on a Disney explored story, even the music adds to the confusion, as it is a post-romantic shaped soundtrack, tonal but which slips endlessly towards undefined fields of tonal chains, a little bit like the late music of Richard Strauss. Music may be over-top some times, but it helps create powerful visual moments.Anyway, i prefer when Miyazaki relies on his beautiful imagination; the images he creates supporting the mythology he invents, that's when he is truly strong. This, to me, is more a sketch, delicious, but lacking a larger form.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
144,Ponyo,9,24 October 2015,Another Ghibli Classiv,".Let's throw a curveball and start by talking about the best part of most Miyazaki movies: the animation. Everything is so fluid and vivid, like it has a personality of its own. It is not quite as detailed as Spirited Away or TWR or Mononoke or The Wind Rises, as they are going for (and nicely get) a picture book style. But it is striking nonetheless. There is an early scene in which a fish just flips through the water. It is just a standard scene, and the fish was just an everyday, typical fish. But it stood out and convinced me that this film would be another Miyazaki masterpiece. Good animation can make important scenes have impact. But great animation gives impact to small moments that no one would think twice about in a live action film.There is a scene in late second third n which we are treated to the sight of a growing moon looming over a two-hundred foot tall wave that collects ships like they were little toys. If I saw a painting like that, I would buy it (if I had the money.) But this is even better; we get to see life move and shift and turn around it. I was captivated. I wanted to stay there forever.When the third act comes and everything floods, I almost let out a shout of glee. I always like looking at houses and buildings and landscapes from on top of a layer of water (Flooded Faron Woods was my favorite part of LoZ: Skyward Sword) , and now I was getting to chance to do so under the guiding hand of one of my personal idols. It did not disappoint, needless to say. These scenes, plus the ones of canoes rowing through the newly flooded streets, exemplify why great animation of any kind is great. It creates a sense of heightened reality; you are immersed in something that is fantastical but familiar; thus, you can invest in it, give yourself to it.The music is no less captivating. Joe Hisaishi is, as I've stated before, one of the greatest composers of any kind of the past century. His music creates a sound that is ambient yet noticeable, wistful yet adventurous. You always notice it and you are always lifted up by it. When the music is needs to be tender, it is more tender than a soft breeze. When it needs to be romantic, it is more romantic than a moonlit row through a moonlit sake with sakura blossoms growing all about. There has never been a moment I've liked purely because of the soundtrack, but there have been many fine moments that a soundtrack has turned into great ones. Including many in this film.Wow. I'm more than halfway through this review and I haven't even mentioned the plot yet. Okay: there is a little fish with a face who wants to be a human, and is given that chance when she tastes a drop of blood from the human boy she bonds with. He father is furious, both because he hates humans and because he knows it will throw the world into balance. If this sounds like the premise to the famous fairytale The Little Mermaid... then you're right. It is based off it.Not closely; it's even more different from the original story than the Disney movie, though that's not a bad thing. But you can definitely see the similarities. The Disney movie and this one make an interesting pair to study; they are about the same distance away from the original story, but they go in different directions. Both movies shows the marks of their company and country and culture. Their takes on the story offer an interesting conversation on the differences between East and West. But I digress. If I had to pick the better movie, I'd go with this one, though they are about equal and the Disney movie has the better protagonist. It's not like with Beauty and the Beast/ Mononoke (yes, Mononoke was inspired by the Beauty and the Beast story, if not directly adapted from it), where this Disney movie, despite being a masterpiece, is outclassed by the jaw-dropping Ghibli movie.The father is played by Liam Neeson, who brings to the role his grit and determination for finding his daughter. Hm. I wonder if whoever made Taken saw this before casting him. Anyways, I just want Neeson to have a film where he goes back in time and beat up the Academy for not picking him for Best Actor for his portrayal of Oskar Schindler. But I digress. His is an interesting character.My favorite, though, is probably the little boy's mom, Lisa. She is refreshingly imperfect but tough and gritty nonetheless; the kind of character you always want to support. You can tell she's been through a lot in her young life, but she retains a sense of playful passion that goes well with her desire to protect herself. Ponyo herself proves, above all else, that Ghibli loves making characters change back and forth between forms. See Howl's Moving Castle right after this movie and you'll know what I mean.It's not a must-see, but it is one that you may find yourself watching time and time again. It just has that combination of infectious charm and clever designs and neat visuals. While I believe all Miyazaki's films to be kinda above ratings and reviews, I'd give it a nine out of ten.After all, not in many movies can I be satisfied with watching a bucket fill up. Goodbye and don't forget the ham."
145,Ponyo,7,26 June 2014,Symphonic Dreamscape,"The world of Miyazaki Hayao is a magical world. Full of extraordinary colours, narrative dreaming and astonishing detail, I've had more than a brilliant time revisiting almost all of his films in the past two months. Sandwiched between the lavish ""Hauru no ugoki shiro"" (2004) and the incomparable masterwork that ""Kaze tachinu"" (2013) is, I was initially underwhelmed by ""Gake no ue no Ponyo"" (2008), and I've been saving it for last in this retrospective of mine. The film unfolds surprisingly slowly in almost symphonic languor without much dialogue, merely introducing in Ponyo a fascinated dreamer-observer paired with another fascinated-dreamer observer in Sôsuke. This beginning meets its counterpart toward the climax of the film, which enters the similar symphonic dreamscape, where reality, manipulated reality and utter fantasy commingle. The environment and concerns for its well-being have always been a part of Miyazaki's stories, and here the topic is brought to the fore perhaps not as subtly as he has done previously, or would in 'The Wind Rises', which in many ways is among the most precious meditations on the effect humans have not only in their lives nor in the lives of others, but in the grand entirety of our planet. I remember I first saw this at a retrospective of Miyazaki's work that anticipated its theatrical release, and remember having difficulty entering it afresh from Miyazaki's work such as 'Howl's Moving Castle'. I've had an inadvertently similar retrospective on my own now, five years later, and again it's difficult to enter either from 'Howl' or 'The Wind Rises'  they exist on a different plane altogether, have different logic of narrative, I think, and even think of animation as having different means to an end, not to speak of the ends. Perhaps, then, I'd come to this not even from ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" (2001) but from ""Tonari no Totoro"" (1988), which shares the most with ""Ponyo"". The difference, however, is that 'Ponyo' seems to lack the wit and ambiguity of Miyazaki's humour that make ""Kurenai no buta"" (1992) and his other films so easygoing. 'Ponyo' is a serious work, but fantastical in a juvenile universe. This, I think, makes it rather hard to follow until the very end, also diminishing the drama.While it is thus certainly a great strength of the artist's to move within the medium in unexpected ways that only pertains to the style but even the thinking behind the style, 'Ponyo', for all the great things, isn't up to the task, dramaturgically speaking. The tempest is a blast, full of real danger, but somehow towards the end I found myself wandering and not where the film was trying to lead. Perhaps it's because the film is devoid of Miyazaki's witty humour that's the soul of his films. Miyazaki seriously considered retiring from filmmaking after ""Mononoke-hime"" (1997), and has announced his retirement from filmmaking after 'The Wind Rises' (2013). Considering we were gifted four amazing works of art, of which 'Ponyo' most certainly is one, it's reason enough to be thankful for."
146,Ponyo,7,18 May 2014,not as good as the best from Studio Ghibli,"Fujimoto is a wizard who turned his back on the human world. He works on the balance of nature and the welfare of the oceans. Brunhilde is Fujimoto's offspring who escapes from his father to find land. On the shores, little boy Sosuke finds Brunhilde trapped in a jar. He renames the goldfish Ponyo. Fujimoto goes searching for her spraying water to walk on. When he brings her back underwater, he find that she is turning into a human. He tries to stop her transformation but eventually they can't be stopped. When she sets off to escape the underwater home, she opened the door to Fujimoto's elixirs. It sets off a dangerous imbalance in the world while transforming her into a human girl. Ponyo finds Sosuke and together help the world find its balance again. Sosuke needs to pass the love test.This is Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki's take on 'The Little Mermaid'. Fujimoto is not really a villain and the story needs a good villain. It's a weird movie marrying the fantasy underwater world with a realistic human world. Overall it is a very cool oddly compelling fanciful movie. The few problems I have are mostly minor ones that I can ignore. First I was confused by all the little fishes with Ponyo. I assumed that Ponyo was their mother and she was running away from her kids. It sets the tone of the character off on the wrong foot. It takes about 30 minutes before the movie explains the situation. That explanation needs to happen at the start. While I like the underwater world, I wish it had more of a Japanese feel whatever that may be. As for the story, it's a lot of craziness going on. Sometimes it's awkward but it's certainly unique."
147,Ponyo,7,8 March 2014,One of the lesser works of art of Miyazaki but still a heartwarming and visually appealing experience.,"The story basically revolves around a boy and a fish 'ponyo', who longs to become a human and stay with the boy. But like other Miyazaki films, there are some great undertones in the film like Pollution, living in harmony with nature and disrupting the balance etc. The problem for me in this film was that it was that there wasn't any real sense of urgency or helplessness nor were there any real consequences and it made it felt too childish at times. I guess maybe it was because this was targeted at younger audiences more. Either way, that really dampened the experience of this otherwise great film.The art/animation was AWESOME. Fluid animation and motion, liquidy feel to it all complementing the oceanic environment of the movie, beautifully and vibrantly colored and great hand drawn surroundings. This is what to expect from the GREAT MIYAZAKI. I don't know what it is but so far in all of Hayao Miyazaki films, there is this true magical/spiritual feel in them which clearly distincts them from other animated works. He is an artistic genius. One of the lesser works of art from Hiyao Miyazaki but still pretty enthralling, heartwarming and visually appealing. 7.5/10"
148,Ponyo,6,8 April 2010,A Paler Little Mermaid,"I recently saw this film at the cinema. I was unsure as to whether I would enjoy it. It was billed as a Japanese Anime version of the Disney classic The Little Mermaid.The film does everything I expected it to, but not in an amazing way. I feel it is a very typical example of the often emotionally overbearing films of Studio Ghibli. Like other films of its type and calibre, the film starts full throttle on attempting to emotionally manipulate its audience. The almost instant and undying love declared by the protagonist for Ponyo, is sudden,overplayed and obvious. Unlike this films predecessor The Little Mermaid, where the attraction between the leads is instantaneous, but the love between the characters is built up gradually throughout the film.As is usual, the animation seems to take precedence, over the plot and storyline. The design of the film is faultless, and looks wonderful. It is a shame that the screenplay wasn't and leaves you thinking that this was just a vehicle to show of the animators art skills.I did enjoy the soundtrack, it was a brilliant score. It truly sums up the feel of the piece and allows for the building up suspense, tension, and it is a perfect way to allow the relationship between the characters to develop.Overall, it is an enjoyable, but remarkably average picture. It is let down by its many and obvious flaws, and is only partially saved by its great animation."
149,Ponyo,8,27 December 2009,Predictable Plot That Suits Children,"The plot is very predictable, as you can see, from the beginning of the story...everything is very predictable. You can't consider 5 years old kids as romance. They are just looking for companions and to think that love can sprinkle at this age is silly. I was looking forward to a more mature and teenage mermaid with an ordinary young man like Sousuke. Anyway, I would totally recommend this to those twelve years old and below as this provide real entertainment to them but for me, a 16 years old, this story appears too far-fetched and I didn't learn much from this movie. The graphics though proves to be amazing. Using water color to portray certain scenes and thus turning it into a movie doesn't make it realistic but create a familiar scene that connect me to my childhood, where everything evolves around pencil, crayons and water color. Thanks to the crew and graphic design department for successfully helping the older ones to reminiscence the sweet moments."
150,Ponyo,6,30 August 2009,Is he an evil wizard?  Gake no ue no Ponyo,"Being in Toronto for a convention that deals with anime meant I couldn't leave the city without actually seeing an anime film, right? Lucky for us, the new Hayao Miyazaki film Gake no ue no Ponyo was playing at the local multiplex just minutes from our hotel. Distributed like his previous few films in the United States by Disney, from its Japanese Studio Ghibli origins, Ponyo ports the vision of its creator in beautiful animation and color with the inclusion of new Hollywood actors to dub in the script. With talent such as Tina Fey, Matt Damon, Betty White, Liam Neeson, Lily Tomlin, and Cate Blanchett, it becomes all about whether the story grabs you and takes you along for its journey. There are no subtitles or ""bad acting"" to make note of, no, the story is key. And was it good enough? In my opinionnot really. Definitely the weakest of Miyazaki's films that I've had the pleasure of watching, Ponyo may work wonderfully for the young children, but unfortunately that is where its success ends. Besides trying to make a comment on humanity's interaction with nature, there really isn't anything more than a cute tale to keep the kiddies occupied for an hour and a half.It's all about young Ponyo, a fish parented by Fujimoto, a human who has decided to leave dry land for the ocean, and Gran Mamare, a sort of God of the sea. Given magic by her father, Ponyo wants to utilize her new power and explore the world; soon finding herself stuck in a glass jar right outside the Cliffside home of Sosuke, a five-year-old boy who enjoys animals. He sees this hurt goldfish and tries to revive her, in effect accidentally allowing her to taste his human blood, which allows for her eventual transformation to human form. Fujimoto attempts to bring her back to the fold and keep a tenuous balance in the world whole, (ocean vs. land), but realizes she has become too powerful for him to subdue. Contacting her mother and consulting with her, he decides to let his daughter stay above water if her love for Sosuke, and his for her, is true. Risking her destruction if the love isn't pure, he knows that it is now up to her to restore balance, bringing the magic of the ocean back, away from the humans who may not be able to control it.Even from the beginning, devoid of voice, only a colorful display of oceanic life, the animation is gorgeous to watch, but sometimes overabundant in its jam-packed frame. The opening scene, watching Ponyo's escape for the surface, makes you a bit disoriented, not knowing what is happening. Are all those little fish her children? Is the creepy water lord Fujimoto a hunter on the search for her? The familial relationship between these characters really doesn't become known until later on. Once the magic is released, however, and these ""fish with faces"" unleash the tsunami prophesized by the elderly Toki, a resident at Sosuke's mother's retirement home, it all makes sense and the audience can just sit back and revel in the artistry at work. A golden glow emits forth and changes aquatic animals into powerful fish and alters the water itself into a school of powerful fish-like waves, slowly rising higher and higher as the moon gets closer and closer, raising the tidethe planetary proximity having been thrown off by the human metamorphosis of Ponyo. The waves themselves reminded me of Hokusai Katsushika and his ""Great Wave off Kanagawa"" woodcut; the artistic comparisons are definitely there throughout, melded with Miyazaki's signature style to become his own.An attempt at infusing the story with an environmentally friendly bent is quickly tossed to the side as the quick retorts of Fujimoto and his disdain for humanity's unclean living become nonexistent. The story becomes more about the love between these two new friends and the acceptance of someone different as equal. Sosuke knows his friend used to be a fish, but his love for her doesn't waver as a result. Even though his father is a fisherman himself, gone long stretches at sea on his large boat, the bond this girl and he create is too powerful to allow for petty differences to interfere. So, in that regard, Ponyo is a great film for the youngsters to make them laugh, get them excited from the tension of the giant storm and search for Sosuke's mother, as well as help them to understand the meaning of tolerance. It is a cute film, well worth your time, and successful at bringing a smile to your face. Unfortunately, it is from the mind of Miyazaki, whose previous works have held such layered storytelling, captivating on so many levels and reaching viewers of all ages. Maybe Hayao wanted to tell a simple story and nothing more. If that is the case, bravo, I guess I just wanted more."
