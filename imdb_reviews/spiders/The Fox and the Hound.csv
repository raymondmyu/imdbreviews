0,The Fox and the Hound,10,11 February 2004,Adorable,"The Fox and the Hound, one of Disney's forgotten treasures, I honestly don't know why this movie is more noticed by people. This is one of my favorite animated movies of all time, it's innocent, it's simple, it's lovely, and just a wonderful tale about the most unlikely pair becoming the best of friends. The Fox and the Hound, yeah, it does go a little overboard on the cuteness factor with baby Tod and baby Copper, but this is when Disney really did mean well and came up with such a sweet and wonderful story that is classic.After a young red fox is orphaned, he is adopted the Widow Tweed, she names him Tod. Meanwhile, Tweed's neighbor, a hunter named Amos Slade, brings home a young hound puppy named Copper and introduces him to his hunting dog Chief. Tod and Copper become playmates, and vow to remain ""friends forever."" Slade grows frustrated at Copper for constantly wandering off to play, and places him on a leash. While playing with Copper at his home, Tod awakens Chief. Slade and Chief chase him until they are stopped by Tweed. After an argument, Slade says that he intends to kill Tod at his first opportunity. Hunting season comes and Slade takes his dogs into the wilderness for the interim. Meanwhile, Big Mama explains to Tod that his friendship with Copper cannot continue, as they are natural enemies, but Tod refuses to believe her. Months pass, and Tod and Copper reach adulthood. On the night of Copper's return, Tod sneaks over to meet him. Copper explains that he is a hunting dog now and things are now going to be different between them.The Fox and the Hound is such a great movie, honestly if you don't like this film, I don't know what's wrong with you, but you need to get something checked because everything about this film is just wonderful. The songs, animation and characters are just lovely. Plus there are some fun jokes, I loved seeing Chief constantly chasing after Tod and then Slade runs over to Tweed's house to scream about the fox but she just kicks his butt and tells him to get off her property. This is such a great movie, I highly recommend you see it if you get the chance.10/10"
1,The Fox and the Hound,10,8 September 1999,Good clean fun with a touch of heartache,"This is my favorite Disney movie of all time. It is, in my opinion, one of their finest. Why do I think so? First, I like its realism. It is not some fantastic fairy tale, nor is it some good-against-evil-good-eventually-triumphs story. There are no heroes or villains in this story. This lack of good and evil made the story and the characters seem more alive than the ones you usually see.I also like the message this movie gives. It is simple yet powerful. The two main characters wanted only the most innocent of things - friendship. Yet society couldn't allow this friendship to be. This movie tugs at your heart, and it doesn't stop tugging. And the realism didn't diminish any by the movie's close. The main characters' problems remained unresolved, yet each finished the movie in contentment. I feel that this lack of a ""everything's okie-dokie again"" finish like you see in traditional animated movies gave this story a powerful element.If you're looking for songs your children can sing over and over again, you've come to the wrong movie. Each song is sung in a flavorful yet discreet manner. Little orchestration. Yet if you're looking for memorable characters, you've come to the right movie. Each character is very well developed, motivated by true emotions and the things that the everyday person wants - love, food, companionship. Each character is vibrantly drawn, and this vibrancy is matched by the character's personality. I saw a real person within the animal. Nobody is created in an idealistic image.From realistic characters come a realistic story. Nothing felt written or hacked. Everything felt like it was supposed to happen. There was nothing outlandish about the entire story. And if you're looking for comedy, you'll find none. This is pure drama, yet it's drama that kids can easily understand. This movie had a story that seemed like it could've easily happened to the average person. This is a rare and endearing quality.Basically, I loved this movie for what it had, a heart of gold, but also for what it lacked, a traditional formula. If you're looking for a story with a difference and a bittersweet flavor, this is the movie for you! It is nice, quiet, yet provocative and emotional. To sum it up, it is good clean fun with a touch of heartache, a true drama!"
2,The Fox and the Hound,10,28 October 2007,"One of the most, if not only, adult Disney movie","Looking back as child having watched this film, it never struck me for anything more than fuzzy/singing/talking animals that pandered to all my childish wants and needs. After all, that's why you watched Disney movies as a kid, right? It's just what you did in your childhood.Now, watching it again, about to embark on adulthood and all that it entails, it really moved me. How Todd and Copper, a young fox and a hound were the best of friends. Todd having been taken in by a kindly old women and nursed backed to health while right next door, Copper, owned by a mean and bitter old hunter, is being groomed as hunting dog.Yet, like children, they don't judge. They don't know about the differences between each other and they don't care. They just want to play hide and seek. It is when they grow older that they realize that it was never meant to be. How sometimes societal rules can stamp out the most innocent of ventures. Much like becoming an adult, reality sets in. Life is unfair.It's a truly beautiful movie, for it's simplistic yet universal message and unlike the vast library of previous Disney inventions, as stated before, it lacks the happy ending. The proverbial feel good formula that is the frame work for all Disney movies. It's because of it's bittersweet delivery and surprising realism, that it's become a lifeline to my childhood that I will carry with me for as long as I live."
3,The Fox and the Hound,9,31 August 2004,The best Disney Animated feature of its generation,"Halfway through production, Don Bluth mutinees, taking most of Disney's best animators with him. Another bunch resign. One dies. Drawings are stolen. Production is delayed endlessly. You would think that if ever a Disney feature were destined for disaster, this was it. Instead, 'Fox and the Hound' is probably the best Disney animated feature of its generation. You could clear a space about 10 years either side of it before you ran into something that gave it serious competition.We start with an orphaned fox kit - pardon me as my jaw doesn't drop in amazement. There have been, what - TWO Disney films where both parents survive? And, well, he is adopted by an elderly widow named Tweed, he develops a friendship with a hunting dog owned by Widow Tweed's crochety neighbor, and he starts to grow up, and life suddenly becomes very difficult, dangerous, and emotionally complicated.I won't give it away, in case you haven't seen it, but for my money this movie has close to the saddest, most desolate, tear-jerking scene in any Disney film I can think of. But don't worry, it bounces back well and truly. This is a long way from being a morose film. In fact it's an excellent balance of drama, action, pathos and humour. My only minor complaint is that there are a couple of comic sidekicks in this movie that are pretty annoying and contribute just about nothing to the story.Coming after 'The Rescuers', 'The Fox and the Hound' might have been the start of a Disney resurrection, but perhaps Bluth's departure really was a body blow. As it is, 'Fox and the Hound' is a moment of beauty and brilliance in the otherwise pretty murky first 20 or so years after Walt's death.Although it didn't cause much of a stir at the time, it has developed a deserved base of loyal fans in the twenty-three years since it was made.The film tackles themes of conflicting loyalties, friendship, love, identity, and somehow does it with a minimum of schmaltz and a maximum of heart. It's one of Disney's best, and you owe it to yourself to see it.9 out of 10
Historical Note: Mickey Rooney plays the adult Tod, the fox in 'Fox and the Hound'. According to Rooney's 1991 autobiography, when he was 5 years old he wandered into an office at Warner during breaks between shooting in one of his child-star films, and introduced himself to a bloke who turned out to be Walt Disney, and who was in the process of drawing a new mouse character, who he decided on the spot to name after Mickey. It just tops it off nicely, doesn't it?"
4,The Fox and the Hound,,18 May 1999,One of the most heartwarming and bittersweet cartoons in years.,"This is a film that both delighted me and deeply upset me, because it seemed so happy, and yet, so unfair at the same time.  The two best friends, the ""Fox and the Hound"", meet again after they are fully grown adults, or, when they are old enough to face the fact that their friendship was never meant to be.  That broke my heart, because it was such a beautiful friendship, unfairly tarnished by a cruel world.  If only our world was a happy place, where races and cultures didn't matter, and if only we could recognize those characters as our friends, and not our enemies simply because of our ethnic differences.  Years later, Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" brought up that same point with a vengeance.  And, like ""The Fox and the Hound"", it shows how much that beautiful friendship between people won't last because of how society determines our friends and enemies.  It makes no sense, and it's unfair.  What's more, Tod, the fox, endures more than any other character in the film.  Other characters, and especially the hunter, discriminated against him without thinking.  And we the audience had to endure seeing him go through this misery, all because he was born a fox!  It's insane! Sadly, it's true to life.  And that is the main reason it was made for kids, to point out how wonderful a friendship is, and how ridiculous it is to tarnish it because of a racial or ethnic difference!  And although this film runs on the standard Disney formula, with the songs, the comic relief, the love interest, and the villain, this film really touched me, because I wanted to see their friendship go on.  And although it did go on in some form, there is always that feeling of ""he doesn't belong"" being uttered by many of the other characters.  Why?  Well, this film asks children and adults alike, that very question."
5,The Fox and the Hound,10,15 July 2003,A beautiful story that is very rewatchable...,"One of Disney's finest motion pictures, extremely underrated and forgotten to a pulp. Kurt Russell, Mickey Rooney and even Corey Feldman all give their talent to this story of a fox and a hound who become friends, only to turn on themselves in later years because they are expected to. Not only is the film engaging, but it also has a metaphorical story going on. I understand it is supposed to represent humans and racism, but apart from the preachiness of it all the film is quite good on the level of a whole. A definite must-see. The ending is bittersweet and at many times during the film you will actually start to feel for these creatures. On a sidenote, I used to have a dog just like the one in this movie. It was just like the one in this film.**** 1/2 out of *****"
6,The Fox and the Hound,10,29 September 2004,One of the best Disney films ever created and one of the saddest films also,"The Fox and the Hound is such an excellent Disney film, being on one of the tops of my list. I couldn't of asked for a better Disney film either. This movie made me cry a lot and I'm a guy. It was like the only movie I cried to except The Return of the King. The movie is bittersweet and heartwarming and the movie also gets into your heart and rushes out. The movie is quite underrated to my belief. Getting a 6.5 rating and 3 stars is just not in my books. Well, I guess the critics do it call a classic so I don't know. I highly recommend this movie and if your looking for a film to cry to this is the movie to get. A very stunning pictureHedeen's outlook: 10/10 **** A+"
7,The Fox and the Hound,9,15 November 2002,Hold on a second: This isn't even rated a 7 on the IMDB?!,"This has got to be one of the most underappreciated Disney classics yet. The Fox and the Hound is probably the most heartwarming Disney film yet. It mixes humor, action, and romance as well as any other Disney film, except for a select few such as Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Mulan, or Tarzan. Nevertheless, I cannot believe this is rated only a 6.6. Several Disney films that are rated above this movie come nowhere near close to it in quality (i.e. Snow White, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty, etc...). I cannot comprehend how it is rated so low...9/10 (Ranks right up there with the likes of Robin Hood and Pinocchio)."
8,The Fox and the Hound,7,20 October 2002,Vastly Under-rated Disney Classic,"This is without a doubt one of Disney's most under appreciated classics. Great animation, fantastic voice acting and lovable characters and before all the PC nonsense that bogs down most newer Disney productions. This is Disney at its best, much better than the likes of Hunchback, Tarzan, Pochonatas, Hercules, Aladdin etc. If you haven't seen this one, give it a try, you'll be in for a pleasant surprise!"
9,The Fox and the Hound,10,24 January 2006,what a great movie!,"This is a wonderful film that is a true classic and a must own for anyone who loves dramas.This movie like the title implies is about two young friends(fox and hound) that when they meet are too young to realize they're supposed to be mortal enemies.the film follows they're story over the course of a year in which the two grow up and realize the friendship that was once so strong between them is forbidden, one is a fox, and the other a bloodhound that hunts foxes.so the dilemma is inherent from the get-go, and at one point the hunter who owns the hound says to the widow who owns the fox that her fox has attacked his chickens and he implies that he'll kill the fox if he ever sees it again.this leaves the widow with only one heartbreaking choice, to let the fox go in an animal preserve(a real tear jerker folks).the hunter hot with rage decides he is not satisfied and intends to find Todd(the fox), and kill him.copper(the hound) and the hunter chase Todd until suddenly a vicious bear appears out of nowhere and attacks the hunter.copper attacks the bear trying to protect his master when the bear turns on him.then its Todd to the rescue as he lures the bear over a cliff to it's death, only Todd falls too.at this point copper having been saved by Todd sees how foolish it was to end they're friendship and rushes to Todd's aid at the bottom of the cliff, the hunter close behind.copper stands over Todd and when the hunter points his gun at Todd he exclaims ""get out of the way boy(copper)"" ... copper stands fast.the hunter angered prepares to fire when copper lets out a mournful whine... the hunter realizes the error of his ways and lowers his rifle saying to copper ""c'mon boy, lets go home"".the movie ends with the widow mending the hunters broken foot, the hunter crying like a baby when she touches it.I'm a rather jaded 17 yeah old guy and i still cry when the widow leaves a bewildered todd at the animal preserve. this is one of my very favorite movies and i'm sure you'll feel the same."
10,The Fox and the Hound,10,1 May 2005,so under appreciated !,"This has got to be one of the best Disney films out there!! I can't believe its not rated at least a 7!! I mean, this was probably the only movie I could stand watching with my mother as a kid. We would both cry our eyes out no matter how many times wed seen it. This is one of the few movies that really shows the villain's in a different light. Most kids movies are afraid to show that the bad guys aren't ALL bad. This movie at least gave the villain a heart. The characters in this movie are amazing. They have such real human traits. This movie shows the importance of friendship and that things are going to change as you get older. That is one of the hardest lessons to learn but one of the most important. Walt wasn't afraid to show it in this one and I respect him for that. If you're gunna take your kid to a movie make it The Fox and the Hound."
11,The Fox and the Hound,10,24 August 2004,A Beautiful Disney Movie,"*May Contain Spoilers*""The Fox and the Hound"" was a great Disney film. I first saw it when I was six years old while I was on vacation. I loved it. Little Tod and Copper are adorable and their friendship is beautiful. I love the songs in this movie, too. My favorite is ""Best of Friends"".This movie is also very sad. In fact I cried the first time I saw this movie when Widow Tweed is getting rid of Tod. My favorite part of this movie is when little Tod and Copper are playing. That part is so cute. I also like the end of the movie. That part is heart warming.I suggest everyone should see this movie because you will love it. I give this movie 10/10 stars."
12,The Fox and the Hound,10,8 April 2004,A very powerful flim,"Spoiler Alert The fox and the hound is one of the best movies out there and it will make you laugh, cry, and feel good. The storyline is very well thought out and is so sad but happy at the same time. I love the way at the end of the movie how Copper thinks back on those good ol' memories that he and Todd had. It's so sad the way how when they were young they had no idea that one day they would be completely enemies and then the time comes when they grow up, but Todd thinks that won't change a thing about Copper's and his friendship but Copper thinks the complete opposite and tells Todd he's a hunting dog now and Todd can't belive it! Then a little later in the movie Todd see's Copper struggling to fight a bear to save his master's life, then the bear gives poor Copper a hit and Copper gets badly hurt, so brave Todd runs to the resque and bites the bear and the bear comes after Todd something fierce and they both fall off the waterfall because the bear breakes the log. After all the fighting and chasing that happened between them Todd saved Copper and the hunter, so in the end Copper saves Todd from the hunter shooting him, but I'd say the hunter relized that if it weren't for Todd him and Copper, would be dead. I love this movie and I'm glad it was made and the great idea came to mind and heart. :)"
13,The Fox and the Hound,10,26 December 2010,You'll Meet Lovable Characters That You'll Remember For A Lifetime.,"Simply put, this is a masterpiece in animation and it will survive the tides of time.The film is loosely based on the 1967 Daniel P.

14,The Fox and the Hound,8,24 March 2006,Not a bad movie.,"The Fox and the Hound will go down in history - if it hasn't already-as one of the best movies ever.While their both young, Tod and Copper are friends. AN old woman rescues Tod, a fox,(whose mother had been killed by a hunter, who owns Copper, a hound dog. As they grow up, however, their friendship becomes endangered by what they have become; Copper is a hunting dog, and Tod is his enemy. THe hunter (voiced by Jack Albertson, in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"") sets several traps for Tod, but the hunter gets his leg stuck in them instead of Tod.All in all, this is one darn good movie.My score: 8/10."
15,The Fox and the Hound,10,1 August 2005,An Overlooked Disney Classic,"Of course, when one thinks of Disney, a fairytale of some sort with a princess comes to mind. But I find that the Fox and the Hound is often overlooked and underrated by the Disney naysayers. This film is not sugarcoated, as many claim Disney movies to be, but an enjoyable examination at the friendship of two unlikely characters.I recently reviewed the Fox and the Hound after a few years, to refresh my memory of the storyline. I remember enjoying it immensely when I was younger. After a somewhat devastating beginning, the film picks up into its Disney mode, with lovable supporting characters in addition to the central two, Tod the fox and Copper the hound.Tod is surprised to see Copper dutifully take on the role in life that he was meant to play, convinced that their friendship will withstand the natural stance that the two are meant to take upon each other. This film is a wonderful mix of tears and laughter, with a bittersweet yet agreeable ending. You realize why things turned out the way that they did and know that it cannot be questioned, but still wonder what could have been. This is one of the best children's films in my opinion. However, due to some tragic circumstances (including death and necessary abandonment), I would not recommend it for extremely young children. When they are old enough to grasp the concepts presented in this film, I do highly recommend it. It won't be a waste of time. There hasn't been a film quite like its original release."
16,The Fox and the Hound,10,13 August 2002,"Pure Joy, I watched this movie as a 6yr old","This movie, I now realize has shaped the definition of ""Friendship"" quite firmly in my mind. I have probably felt the depths of my feelings watching this movie as a 6 year old. Quite strangely, I recall my Dad as the person who took me to this Movie. My heart and soul were in the movie as I watched it."
17,The Fox and the Hound,10,2 January 2009,This movie will never get old,"The Fox and the Hound is amazing. I love how it shows how powerful friendship can be. One of my favorite Disney movies of all time.My favorite characters are the adult Tod and Chief. Tod's voice was Mickey Rooney who was also the voice of all the Santa Claus' in ""Santa Claus is coming to town"" and ""a year without Santa Claus"" which I thought was awesome. Also the personality of Tod is a lot like my own. He is very playful and out-going. Even though Copper, the hound and old best friend tries to hunt Tod down, Tod still comes back and helps his best friend out. Chief is also a lot like me. I am an older step-brother. So when my younger brother came around I felt like I get the back seat to him.The songs aren't all that great but they fit in with the movie so well. People say that this movie isn't a good kids movie but that's not true. I watched it with my six year old cousin and she loved it.My favorite part of this movie is the end where the camera zooms out from Copper and Chief. Then it says ""Copper, your my very best friend."" ""And your mine to Tod."" and so on. Every time I see that I can't help but smile.This was a great Disney movie and I'm a huge fan of Disney. Fox and the Hound is a great addition to the magical world of Disney."
18,The Fox and the Hound,3,17 May 2013,The fox and the hound...or let's blast that dang fox!,"I am in the minority of reviewers that didn't like this movie and I'm still scratching my head as to why. There was nothing heartwarming about this film. In summary, this movie is about Amos, the crazy, trigger happy, red neck maniac, who spends three quarters of the movie trying to hunt and kill a fox named Tod. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what was motivating him to do so. At one point, he even fires at the old woman's car as she's driving it because the fox was in the back seat. The friendship between the two main characters is driven apart when the older hunting dog, Chief, is injured in the process of trying to kill the fox. The hound then swears revenge on the fox...for running for his life? I was really hoping that the bear would have killed Amos and his dog so that the poor fox could get some peace. Instead, the fox saves the two blood thirsty companions and is nearly killed himself by the bear. Even then, Amos still makes another attempt to kill the fox. The movie is supposed to be about a friendship between a fox and a hound that is broken as they grow up and assume their roles as the animals that they are, but I didn't really get a sense of a friendship because they only spent about a minute developing that aspect of the movie. There are also some other characters in the background that don't really move the story much or provide the levity they are supposed to. The music is terrible and Big Momma sounds as though she is improvising the lyrics and melody of the songs. The dialog was really choppy and awkward and did not flow well. I got the sense that this movie was slapped together with bobble gum and scotch tape a few days before it was in theaters.I understand what this movie was attempting to be, but I feel that it failed miserably."
19,The Fox and the Hound,4,15 November 2010,They didn't call this the dark age for nothing.,"The ruins of an interesting film can be seen here. I don't know much about the creation of this film, nor about its source material, but I don't feel especially compelled to. The Fox and the Hound features moments that try to attain the kind of drama of Disney's very earliest work, but by the end comes off as little more than a retread of past Disney films with much weaker animation and less compelling characters, despite some psychological content that might have held potential for more mature storytelling.Structurally, this thing is a straight lift of Bambi. The first half details Tod the Fox and his days as a child learning the ways of the world. Interestingly, the film kicks off with a surprisingly dark tone, killing off the mother in the first scene and leaving an orphaned cub to be taken in by Tweed the widow. Already, some interesting themes are introduced as we see Tod make friends with the hound pup Copper, a friendship that's clearly doomed to tragedy. Aside from the obvious forbidden friendship, there are themes of man's relationship to nature in the widow becoming a mother figure to Tod. Clearly, this was the most character driven Disney feature in a long time for Disney. Does it pay off? Nope. Mostly, the first half of The Fox and the Hound prefers to waste time with a bunch of asinine comic set-pieces in which the twosome play tricks on Chief the hound and get the Hunter all riled up for some wacky redneck gags. In between this is a lot of cloying nothing that isn't half as cute as watching Bambi stumble his way through early life. It meanders and meanders without really making much of a point other than these guys enjoy each others company. There's also some side plot about a pair of woodpeckers trying to get a worm, but it adds up to absolutely nothing and mostly serves as annoying padding.Then, like Bambi, we get the second half where Tod simultaneously discovers his sexuality and the horrors of life. This half works a bit better, with some moments of real power, but makes a fatal flaw with the relationship between Tod and Copper. Tod sends Copper on a vengeance fueled rampage against his former friend when he...gets Chief's leg broken. Now, had Chief been shown as a faithful friend and father figure to Copper, and had Tod gotten him killed (as, I believe, it was originally meant to be) this shift would have real gravitas to it. Instead, it comes off as unearned and random, totally against what we've come to know about his character. The rest of the film simply doesn't have the weight it needs because of this one fatal script flaw.Which isn't to say there aren't those moments that truly work wonders toward the end. The bear scene in particular, though rather abrupt, is fantastically animated and legitimately thrilling, a triumph for greenhorn lead animator Glen Keane. The climax, in which the Hunter compromises his pride, is legitimately powerful as an ending, and in a better context would have been truly moving. Alas...whatever moments work here, they're constantly hindered by what comes before and after.As animation, The Fox and the Hound is a real step down for the studio. Disney's newfound star, Don Bluth, stayed aboard for a time before packing his bags and walking out to start work on the vastly superior Secret of NIMH. His team's animation here reminds of their work on The Rescuers; very well done technical wizardry for pretty vapid scenes. A few of the Nine Old Men do scant work here and there, but none of it stands out. The best work is done by future star animator Glen Keane, whose bear scene has a remarkable weight and power to it, and whose Badger character is kind of fun too. Otherwise, the animation on this film is competent at best and mechanically dictated by adherence to animation principals at worst. It's a shame seeing technical elements so by-the book here. What's even more distressing is that it's still far better animated than the next Disney project, which will barely pass ""Saturday Morning Cartoon with more in-betweening"" levels.One can see the process Disney was going through. Take an old framework like the plot to Bambi and update it to fit the trend of edgier animation that was going on at the time. It's too bound by convention to be anything but a pale retread, unfortunately, and it's unsurprising that the Disney exodus took place during the making of this and The Black Cauldron. Bluth moved to his new studio to make The Secret of NIMH, a great, dark fantasy feature that accomplished everything Disney was trying to, and various others left either with him or to start their own projects.It's really a precursor to The Black Cauldron, a film that aims for the same goals to a much more prevalent and upfront manner while failing even more miserably as a film. They didn't call this the dark age for nothing."
20,The Fox and the Hound,,7 April 2013,Charming Disney Film,"The Fox and the Hound (1981) *** (out of 4) Another Disney charmer about the unlikely friendship between a fox (voiced by Mickey Rooney) and a hunting dog (voiced by Kurt Russell). The two of them are eventually thought that they're not supposed to get along but this here is challenged when both are in need. THE FOX AND THE HOUND is without a doubt a very charming little film even though the story itself isn't all that original and I think there are a few too many clichéd characters and jokes throughout. Still, I like the fact that the studio threw in some added social commentary dealing with people who are ""supposed"" to hate one another even if there's no real reason. I think some of the strongest stuff here are the vocal performances including the wonderful Pearl Bailey who plays Big Mama. I thought she brought a lot of soul to the performance and easily managed to be the best vocal performance. It seems both Rooney and Russell aren't overly popular among Disney fans but I thought both of them were good here. Neither one deserves a place in the Disney Vocal Hall of Fame but they are still fun and share some nice chemistry together. I thought all of the lead characters were quite charming and fun to watch. The fox certainly is the best written of the group but I also enjoyed the older dog and well as the new one in training. The animation was extremely well done and especially during the finale when we're given an excellent fight between the fox, the hound and a bear. The amount of detail in this sequence is just wonderful. With that said, I thought the rest of the characters were quite forgettable and I thought there really weren't enough laughs to really carry the thing. Still, THE FOX AND THE HOUND has enough to where it should keep fans of the genre entertained."

Not the warning of doom and gloom as, say, The Black Hole, or the absolutely surrealistic fantasy of Cinderella. But a fine and balanced medium. Disney's supreme animated effort as far as I am concerned. Loyalties remain. Maturity happens. A hunting we will indeed go. But the prey is captures, and precious memories of childhood return and the bitterest and most old school man of the woods is touched. It was once said all is well that ends well. I believe a wise old Englishman said that during the time of Elizabeth the First. Wisely said. **********"
22,The Fox and the Hound,8,29 September 2012,Enjoyable and sad,"I was on a car trip to Virginia when I first saw this movie. It looked really sad so I wasn't sure if I really wanted to see. Thank god that I saw this film! It's really good.I just learned that this movie was based off a book and it seemed like the most depressing and disturbing summary I've ever read (along with Hunchback of Notre Dame). Well, let's get back to the Disney version. It has some really enjoyable moments when little Copper and Todd played or the woodpecker scenes. They just make me so happy. Some scenes made me sad when Todd had to be let go or the introduction to the movie (you should just skip the first scene and wait until Big Mama gets introduced). I find this movie really good! How could people hate it?The music isn't great. All I remember is ""Goodbye May Seem Forever"" and it makes me cry. The characters are sub-par. Is Big Mama a girl or a boy? I can't really tell, he just sounds gay. Copper is adorable when he was young, but why did you turn into a giant d- bag when you were older? Vixie has a stale white bread personality. I would hate Amos when he's a real life person. Chief is pretty cool. Todd is one of my favorite characters. He's adorable, innocent, friendly, and tough! Otherwise, I really like this movie!Get a bag of popcorn, a box of tissues, and waterproof mascara in order to enjoy The Fox and the Hound"
23,The Fox and the Hound,,9 June 2012,JUST ALMOSTas good as Bambi.,"I gained some interest in this one. So I picked it up at best buy for 20$. Now, My favorite Disney movie ever is ""Bambi"". But When I was watching it Half-way through, I thought this was going to beat Bambi.Negatives: Some of the drawings/Animation looks odd. The scenes were it shows the birds chasing the caterpillar throughout the movie, are REALLY pointless and serves no point but to be filler scenes. Positives: The Film is very depressing at times. But in a very powerful way. (especially the ending.) I REALLY like the design of the foxes. Soundtrack is great, The voices are great. Very entertaining. There was a scene where the old lady abandons Todd. This scene made EVERYONE cry. (according to some facebook posts.) when I was watching it, I didn't even drop a tear. But I can see why it's so sad.  Overall: The Fox and the hound made it to NUMBER 2 in my favorite Disney movies. However Bambi is STILL the king."
24,The Fox and the Hound,10,13 March 2009,Ahhh.,"Don't we all love the classics?That's what this generation is missing, good animation (Ratatouille,cars, what? you jokin right?)I must admit, it makes me sad to see Todd (fox) and Copper (hound) to break their friendship.Sometimes Coppers owner reminds us of our father, trying to separate the girl from boy.Todds owner reminds us of our mother, trying to watch her boy/girl from trouble and one day have to let them go.All children will love this, I'm positive about that.Timeless and great.Also better than these so-called cartoons nowadays."
25,The Fox and the Hound,10,12 December 2006,A true Disney classic,"I believe 'The Fox and The Hound' to be a heartwarming yet at the same time heartbreaking film. The fox, Tod, and the hound, Copper, wanted nothing more than to be best friends, but this friendship is tragically not meant to be simply because Copper was born a hunting dog and Tod was born a fox, its just not fair. This is in my opinion probably one of the best yet most under-appreciated Disney film of its time. The voice acting is perfect and the songs are memorable classics. The Fox and The Hound deserves a far better rating than a 6.8.I have only seen it twice, once when I was little and the other just a few minutes ago. It brought me to tears both times, I would recommend this Disney classic to all audiences as it can be loved and understood by all."
26,The Fox and the Hound,8,25 October 2006,Disney Animated Neorealism?,"Okay, so placing The Fox and the Hound into the same category as The Bicycle Thief may be a stretch, but there is something about this movie that sets it apart from all other Disney animated films. Fox, along with Bambi and Lady and the Tramp, are the only Disney animated films that portray a reality without fairy dust, animals wearing clothes or lions that have formed alliances with hyenas to overthrow an animalistic royal lineage. True- the animals do talk and occasionally sing, but for the most part, they do stay true to the nature of their existence. But, Bambi, with its characters reacting against and to nature, borders on being an animated nature documentary (if such a thing is possible.) And, Lady and the Tramp has far too cheery of a Hollywood ending to be accepted as neorealism. Which leaves Fox and the Hound: the tale of young pup Copper and fox Tod who become childhood friends and are then forced to turn on each other by the demands of society. Not exactly your standard Disney fare. And, most importantly, it has a true, realistic, bittersweet ending. It's only been attempted once by Disney and probably never again. Which is a shame because Fox and the Hound has some of the most sincere and heartbreaking moments ever brought to animation. It isn't a perfect film, but its intentions are honorable and that makes The Fox and the Hound a true animated classic.**Note- the current 25th Anniversary DVD does not do justice to this film. It is not presented in the correct aspect ratio. The image has been cleaned to a degree, but there is too much digitization. Considering the significance of Fox and the Hound in the history of Disney animation, it deserves a two disc, widescreen DVD release."
27,The Fox and the Hound,10,29 August 2006,"Sweet, sweet, Disney!!!!!","Disney's ""The Fox and the Hound"" is an animated movie from 1981, nearing the huge gap that lasted theatrically throughout the 1980s. It is a heartwarming tale about a fox and a hound who, instead of fearing each other (in this case, the dog hunts down the fox in reality), they become friends.This movie is notable not only for its gentleness, but the theme music (quiet sounding; dun, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-duuuuun, dun, dun!): at the beginning, it's all quiet and serene! And it sounds very familiar, too! I've seen this when I was little and thanks to this movie, the theme just sticks into your mind for a while!!!!!What's also interesting is that, even though it's the 80s, the credit sequences are still the same as always from the 1920s up. I've noticed that when this played on one of the Spanish stations a few months back. Which I found very interesting.""The Fox and the Hound"" may not be the best, but you'll love it!!!!!10/10"
28,The Fox and the Hound,,29 May 2006,Gorgeous Disney Animation,"THE FOX AND THE HOUND (ANIMATED) **** A children's buddy/adventure film about two young animal friends (voiced by Mickey Rooney as a fox and Kurt Russell as a hound dog) who's relationship clashes with their natural instincts as they grow up into adults. This gorgeous Disney animation is a nice little tale of relationship, but it isn't one of the all time classic films. Together with its 1980s counterparts, it paved the way between the older Disney masterpieces and the modern day ones.Rating System ***** Excellent **** Good *** Fair ** Poor * Bad"
29,The Fox and the Hound,10,8 May 2006,One of the most realistic and in-depth Disney Classics,"The best thing about THE FOX AND THE HOUND is, I believe, the absence of a white-and-black line that adds realism to the movie. There is no real ""bad"" guy, and you can sympathize the characters from both sides of the story. The fact the two childhood friends grow up to be enemies (as their species are ""supposed"" to be) is heartbreaking yet not at all a tearjerker. Summary: The conflict is incredibly sad. The pace is calm and natural. The animation is excellent in its own right. The story itself has reached the height of a mature drama. Spoiler: the ending is not one of those ""perfect"" endings you might expect from a children's movie; it's far more realistic, meaningful and endearing. Definitely my all-time favorite Disney movie."
30,The Fox and the Hound,,26 August 2003,This movie makes me cry everytime! *Spoilers*,"I can't watch this movie, because it makes me cry everytime. It's so sad. I just burst into tears everytime I watch it. It's quite possibly the saddest cartoon movie out there. The only other movie that makes me cry is ""The Outsiders."" This movie is so good! Everyone should see it,and it is definitely underrated."
31,The Fox and the Hound,,13 October 2002,one of disney's best! perfection..,"This film is one of the most beautifully animated films I have ever seen.. I first saw this film in the early 90's and I fell in love with it.. the characters are very well develloped in the story and you cannot help but love them.. personnaly, I really loved amous slade in the movie..he was a prick, but just his attitude made me like him..This movie is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again without getting tired of it, no matter what age you are..I'm 16 years old and I still enjoy watching this! whenever I babysitt some kids, I always make sure to bring this movie..but, the most special thing about this movie is that it demonstrates the true power of friendship, and that's something that everyone should experience.This film will keep you entertained from beginning to finish..And I must add that this is truly a classic and it should not be ruined by some cheesy sequel.. In my opinion, that's what disney  has been doing a lot lately.. ruining classics.. I hope to God that it stops..So, all in all, this movie is fantastic! I rate it 10/10.. It beats Beauty and the Beast and Lady and the tramp for me!!"
32,The Fox and the Hound,10,15 July 2002,brilliant,"this movie has touches me and it left something behing that will be with me for the rest of my life.. a brilliant movie and a must see!!!! i just wish they would make a sequil!!! Its perfectly animated and you can watch it over and over and see something new each time, it leaves one or two things unfinshed at the end, so some ppl may be unsatisified but if you ask me that just leaves room for a sequil (im crossing my fingers) this is a must see."
33,The Fox and the Hound,9,20 July 2006,Very touching Disney classic about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart,"THE FOX AND THE HOUND, in my opinion, is a very touching Disney classic about a special friendship for all ages that will warm your heart. I really loved the things that Tod and Copper did together. If I could have, I would have helped him get to safety myself. The only problem is how I would get him to safety, since I can't drive. The score was good, the costumes were perfectly designed, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about a special friendship for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it."
34,The Fox and the Hound,10,24 February 2006,BBC News Frontpage has words cancer op which gives you the partial anagram copper,"The Fox and the Hound is a delightful Disney Film. The young Copper and Todd are cute. Kurt Rusell provides the voice for the older Copper. This movie teaches children to help their friends.In a previous review I said that someone said to me ""The only thing keeping Brad out of prison is that the British said Copper. Well the BBC Frontpage has the words cancer op which gives you the partial anagram copper. I said in a previous review that I wear a copper Newfoundland penny necklace of my Grandfather King George VI Windsor. Investigating Canadians write these facts in a report or you are obfuscating the truth. Thanks again to my Aunt Queen Elizabeth 2 Windsor for hinting that I am her full nephew and a Windsor. By the way I really am the American Shadow Vice President also. President Kennedy said here on Earth Gods work must truly be our own. That is why I am working hard to clear my name as the Grandson of the Creator Ki chosen Messiah King George VI Windsor. The movie The Rescuers is another excellent Disney Film that has a character named penny."
35,The Fox and the Hound,10,17 April 1999,I still cry when I see it...,"This is one of my childhood favorites that will remain in my heart forever. The scenery is beautiful, the story is bittersweet. I think this movie is just perfect! Rating: 10"

37,The Fox and the Hound,7,13 April 2007,"7 and a 1/2 out of ten, a beautiful, heartwarming film!!","Since I was very young, this has been one of my childhood favourites. For a long period of time, I hardly watched it, but luckily we watch it regularly again now! :) I love the characters, the storyline is pretty good, the animation is lovely Disney and the songs are good! The film is about an orphaned fox called Tod, who is cared for by a human called Widow Tweed and an owl called Big Mamma. One day, the next door farmer buys a basset hound puppy, about the same age as Tod. When the two meet, they become the best of friends...I recommend this to all dog lovers, fox lovers, people who like Disneys but also like non- Disney cartoons, children who like a good adventure story and adults who would like to try out a heartwarming Disney classic. Enjoy!P.S There are a few scary scenes, so some cautious parents may want to decide which scenes to fast-forward when their kids are watching."
38,The Fox and the Hound,10,3 August 2001,"Charming, Bittersweet,Underrated","""If only the world wouldn't get in the way, If only people would just let you play...""If you love foxes & dogs, you mustn't miss this one. Tod is my favourite character, loyal, fun-loving & innocent. Copper is adorable as a puppy and as an adult remains sympathetic. His dilemma is an especially poignant one. The three birds & Squeeks provide good comic relief. Chief, the Widow & Amos are good also. With the exception of ""Best of Friends"" the songs aren't too memorable but they do their job. There are stunning sequences and the film comes to a satisfactory conclusion. It certainly deserves more recognition.  9/10"
39,The Fox and the Hound,10,20 December 2014,A new favourite movie of mine thats up there with the rest of my all time favourite movies.,The Fox & The Hound is directed by Richard Rich who also directed one of my favourite non-Disney movies of all time The Swan Princess. The story of this movie however The Fox & The Hound is about a orphan fox named Tod(voiced later by the late Mickey Rooney from Night & The Museum)who is reared by an elderly woman in a farm. Later he meets a hound called Cooper(played by Goldie Hawn's partner Kurt Russell)who befriends Tod and the two become inseparable. Of course Cooper's owner is a fox hunter and he goes off till next spring. Years later they are both grown up and become rivals but can the two ever become best friends again.Now I saw this after a long long time as I bought it on DVD as I am trying to buy some of the Disney classics as there is a deal now at the minute where you can collect every Disney movie now at a reasonable price and I picked this up because I haven't seen it in a long time like I said. So what did I think of it well I saw it with my brother last night and he teared up where Cooper left Tod and when the old widow lady left Tod in the woods and he was in tears saying its so sad. It was a very heartbreaking scene but I didn't cry at it. Also I loved the animation as Glen Keane(who is my favourite animator from Disney before his retirement) and also it has Chris Buck(who would later become a director and direct the highly overrated film Frozen). Overall this was a very nice heartwarming tale about a fox befriending a hound and you see them grow up and later reconcile later on in the film.Also in this film is the woman who voices Queen Uberta in The Swan Princess Sandy Duncan as Vixiy(Tod's love interest).For me I give this movie 5 stars and a 10/10
40,The Fox and the Hound,10,20 November 2014,My heart broke about 20 times,"The simple story about a fox and a dog has many things to teach us about compassion, friendship, and acceptance.It's tough to try to find something bad about this film, maybe one could argue that the animation isn't as good as in later Disney films but I think many would agree that it is much more charming. The hand-drawn look has something that really stands out and adds a more human touch. Looking at the later Disney iterations where everything is a perfect line at a perfect angle gets really old for me personally and it stabs me in the eye instead of letting the imperfect be imperfect. But I guess that goes for most of modern culture where everything is made to be as perfect as possible. If you look at the static music of today for example and compare it to the groove which jazz and funk musicians of the 40s and 50s you'll know what I'm talking about... That utterly charming ""human"" quality... This film has a ton of it.However,I don't think I've ever been inflicted with so much emotion from watching a film. I honestly cried my heart out! It's a lovely film with lots of character. It doesn't rely on gimmicks(as so much of the modern Disney films do) rather it relies on strong writing with no scene being unimportant.A shining gem from the past that taught me several heartfelt lessons."
41,The Fox and the Hound,,5 November 2014,Heartwarming Story !!,"This is one of my all-time favorite cartoons ever since my childhood.It shows us unlikely but really beautiful friendship between little Fox and Puppy who is being trained to become Hunting Hound...Several events take place and they are forced to become enemies and their lives change from its core...They soon have to adjust to extreme changes but eventually learn what is the most important thing...This story is so wonderful, heartwarming and beautifully made that it can't leave anyone indifferent. And it sure brings back great memories ... ah nostalgia ... I would recommend it to everyone. And it will always have a place in your heart."
42,The Fox and the Hound,10,24 October 2014,One Of My Favorite Animated Films,"I loved it then and I love it now. This film brings back good memories from my childhood. It is a long time favorite film. Such a good story about friendships. A friendship. That is exactly what this movie is about. The friendship between Todd (a fox) and Copper (a hound).This movie has quite a bit of comedy in it although the movie is a drama with some of the saddest moments in a Disney animation. One of the reasons I loved this movie was the fact it plays with the viewers emotions. It is a fabulous story.This movie is definitely underrated and deserves to be in the top 20 list of Disney's finest animated films - just my opinion.If you enjoyed other Disney animations like ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""The AristoCats"", ""Dumbo"", or ""101 Dalmatians"" then you might enjoy The Fox and the Hound.10/10"
43,The Fox and the Hound,10,29 September 2014,A Masterpiece,"This movie is truly a masterpiece. It contains such well defined characterizations-both human and animal and is able to elicit such deep, layered emotion from the audience. One feels genuine fear, loss, excitement and love from this movie! The songs are fun and serve the story well. Tod is the true friend we all want to be and have in our lives-his depiction alone makes the movie a classic. There are many sad scenes in this film, but none feel overdone. The saddest scene of all occurs when the Widow has to say goodbye to Tod-guarantee there won't be a dry eye in the house! A compelling story drives this movie-and its ultimate lesson about enduring friendship-through enormous obstacles-is one the whole family will treasure."
44,The Fox and the Hound,10,30 May 2013,"Pure perfection, a true masterpiece","This movie had me in tears near the end. However, I wasn't crying tears of sadness...I was crying tears of joy. This movie is a true Disney masterpiece that I grew up watching as a child and I will hold it dear to my heart until the day I die. Through the events and characters within the movie, this film nails the feelings of love, friendship, and sacrifice, and hardships that no other animated movie has ever nailed so perfectly. I commend Don Bluth with his hand in the animation department, as well as the composer on the breathtaking score. The plot, characters, and values portrayed within the film are right on the edge of perfection and quality. Believe me, this film will have you coming back for more,a must-see for the entire family!"
45,The Fox and the Hound,7,15 August 2012,A bittersweet send-off to one of the greatest Disney animation eras.,"Walt Disney Productions wouldn't release another animated feature until the dreaded ""Black Cauldron"" in 1985, by which point the last of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men (Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Wolfgang Reitherman) had departed from the studio (after having worked there since before 1937's ""Snow White""), Michael Eisner had taken over the Magic Kingdom, changed the company's name to Walt Disney PICTURES and pushed NEARLY ALL (if not ALL) film credits to the end of their animated features from the aforementioned ""Black Cauldron"" onwards (all animated Disney productions from before the dawn of Eisner's reign in 1984 ONLY had opening credits and simply ended with ""THE END"") and brought Disney dangerously close to Rock Bottom.While the film isn't my favorite Disney flick, it's certainly a very sweet charming finale to the good old days at Disney. Especially the bonds between Tod and the Widow Tweed, and, of course, Tod and Copper, themselves (""The Best of Friends"" and ""Goodbye May Seem Forever"" are two of the most poignant songs in the Disney canon, ESPECIALLY the latter, when the Widow Tweed has to reintroduce Tod to the forest). Even the ""villains"" (if you can even call them that) are actually likable and sympathetic (extremely unusual by Disney standards). Amos Slade the hunter is not your stereotypical ""evil hunter"" (that character archetype was not established until Percival McLeech in ""The Rescuers 2"" in 1990). He only hunts for a living and is, incidentally voiced by (and is even drawn to RESEMBLE) Jack Albertson, best known as Grandpa Joe in the original version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (this was also one of Albertson's last roles and the last film he starred in to be released prior to his death just a few months later in 1981). Copper's fellow hunting dog, Chief, seems like a bit of a curmudgeon, but is shown to have a heart of gold, when taking to the young Copper (though he does become somewhat jealous when Amos pays more attention to Copper than to him). Did I mention that Chief's voiced by Pat Buttram, who Disney fans will also know as the Sheriff of Nottingham in ""Robin Hood"" (1973) and Luke, the whiskey-drinking muskrat in ""The Rescuers"" (1977), and I'll admit, this definitely seems like one of his more serious, sympathetic voice roles for Disney (The Sheriff of Nottingham may have been laughably evil, but he was still a tax-collecting jerk, and, of course, a comedic idiot). It's hard for me to say whether or not Chief should have been killed after the train accidentally ran him over halfway through the film. On one hand, it would be believable that he'd die, as the train was shown to violently strike him off the bridge and send him sprawling onto the rocky waters below (mostly on screen, and much more detailed than Trusty merely being accidentally knocked over by the dogcatcher's wagon skidding to a sudden halt in ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955)), and it would've fully justified Copper and Amos temporarily being upset with Tod for some time after the incident. However, Chief seemed somewhat admirable underneath his curmudgeon-like mannerisms (though not quite on par with the aforementioned Trusty in terms of likableness) and so it may be good that he survived (Incidentally, Trusty and Chief would've BOTH ended up dying in their respective films had ""executive meddling"" as TV Tropes calls it, not decided to spare them, which makes one wonder why they DID kill off some perfectly likable characters in later Disney films such as ""The Lion King II: Simba's Pride"", ""Tarzan"" and even ""The Princess and the Frog"").Anyways, ""The Fox and the Hound"" is again, a beautiful goodbye to classic Disney, as (I forgot to mention earlier) even when Disney did recover from the critical disaster of ""The Black Cauldron"" (with the likes of ""The Great Mouse Detective"", ""Oliver & Company"", and, of course, ""The Little Mermaid""), Disney animation was never truly the same again. The words ""The End"" conclude the entire film in a way almost no previous Disney film had done before (except possibly ""Bambi"" and ""The Rescuers""): An audio flashback of young Tod and Copper saying however they'll always be friends forever (""Yeah, forever."") with a soft sweet finale medley blending the aforementioned ""Best of Friends"" and ""Goodbye May Seem Forever"" together. Two chimes faintly ding as the following words appear on screen for the final time:The End - Walt Disney Productions. :.)"
46,The Fox and the Hound,10,27 February 2012,One of the best Disney films ever. Seriously underrated.,Many critics have said that The Fox and the Hound is a bit too cute. I have to disagree. While it is mainly a sugarcoated film it has it's dark and intense moments as well. The story revolves around an orphaned baby fox named Tod and his friendship that he forms with a hound dog named Copper who is owned by a hunter who lives nearby. Their friendship seems unbreakable and forever lasting but Tod is warned that Copper will become a trained killer after he goes on a hunting trip. Time passes and Tod wonders if they are still best friends. What happens later on will put their friendship to the ultimate test.The Fox and the Hound has it's ups and downs. The last fifteen minutes of the film shows what finally happens between Tod and Copper. A surprise turn of events unfold. What happens? Watch and find out.This film shows us that even the most unlikeliest of people can become great friends. It also seems to touch on the racism issue. Not long ago black and white people could not be good friends or it brought criticism. This seems to make sense with Tod being a Fox and Copper being a hound. They are supposed to be born enemies but the innocence of youth blinds them to this. Will the friendship last?
47,The Fox and the Hound,8,29 December 2011,One of the most beautiful friendship stories ...,"""The Fox and the Hound"" possesses all the characteristics of what could have been a great Disney film: the realistic animation, a clear and positive message about tolerance through the heartbreaking story of an endearing friendship between a young fox named Todd and a pup named Copper, yet the film didn't garner the same recognition that other Disney classics. Rarely criticized either, ""The Fox and the Hound""' missed success is somewhat complex to comprehend because it both succeeds in touching a sensitive chord and illustrated the perfect case of a film that could have been much more better but lacked something special at the end. It's been years and years since I have been watching it but it was enough to remember the story and the following review conveys my feeling only as a kid, which probably gives some partial reasons for the film's mixed reception.I guess what makes the film so appealing is that behind the friendship story between two innocent little animals who ignore everything about their ancestral rivalry is that it celebrates more the innocence of childhood than the importance of friendship. As kids, we tend to ignore the barriers and open our hearts more genuinely, when Copper meets Todd, they spontaneously play hide-and-seek and their gradual friendship fill the film with the tenderness needed to let us expect the worse when adult time will come. This stress is confirmed by the antagonism between the two neighbors, Widow Tweed who adopted Todd, after her mother left him in the farm before being killed by a hunter  and Amos Slade, a hunter himself. The death happens off-screen and its horror is conveyed by the shocked expression of Big Mama Owl who witnessed the sacrifice of Todd's mother, this scene echoes the iconic Bambi's mother death scene and made the presence of Slade more unsettling, as a perpetual menace for Todd. Slade isn't by essence a villain, since he's Copper's master, but he'll develop a gradual hostility toward Todd, along with his other dog, much older than Copper, named Chief.The relevance of the story is that it questions how we keep being conditioned by our innate heritage, and again it's less about the friendship than, its resistance to natural obstacles. The danger is that as time goes by, the two little friends realize that they are meant to be enemies, and as adorable as the first scenes were, I was waiting for the moment they would become enemies, wondering about the way the conflict would be solved. Undoubtedly the last ten minutes of the film belongs to some of the best that Disney climactic and concluding sequences with the fight between Todd and Copper, the last-minute entrance of the scary red-eyed bear, the only truly 'villainous' character and the crucial moment when Slade is about to shoot an exhausted Todd before Copper makes it clear to his Master that there is at least one fox that must be spared. Happy or sad ending, it's up to the viewer but I remember the impact of the last shot, and while I write these lines I have goose bumps remembering Todd and Copper living separately and the voice-over reminding us that they were great friends. The ending is magical, the beginning is great  I wish I could stop the review here, but for honesty's sake, I have to mention that the problem of the film is in the middle.As a kid, I remember I got myself ready for an event I thought to be inevitable: Chief's death. I thought the only thing that could have lit Copper's anger would be the death of his beloved sourpuss mentor. I liked Chief and I didn't want him to die but neither did I for more sympathetic Disney characters who still met their demise in their respective films. Anyway, even as a kid, I thought it was the only way for the narrative to evolve. But it didn't, the Disney animators probably though that the death of Todd's mother was upsetting enough, that it would create a disconcerting feeling, but now, with some perspective, we can all agree that good ol' Chief would have improved the film's quality by choosing to die. He doesn't play a significant part to the story after the accident and let's face it, why would Copper blame for Todd for having 'almost' killed him especially since it was an obvious case of self-defense (sorry for the technicality). That didn't make sense. and I would have been tempted to make the same reproach about the character of Dixie, the female fox, because the movie should have focused on the friendship story and avoid a forced romantic subplot (there are enough romantic Disney films for that) one emotional relationship was alone, but at least, it wasn't overdone and I guess it had to provoke Todd's protective instinct and readiness to fight Copper.There is no other criticism apart that the film is very adult and sober in its material and hardly saves the mood with catchy songs or memorable subplots, the two birds were cute but the running gag involving the worm could have been used for any other film, while a subplot should intelligently interfere with the main story. As for the songs, I'm incapable to remember one, but I guess not all the Disney films are meant to be musicals, and the score is so charming and haunting it accompanies my memories with sweet and very tender images. And the last five minutes of the film, redeem the little flaws I mentioned because they convey with a heartbreaking poetry the emotional core of the film, which is a beautiful friendship that resisted life's adversity. Rarely mentioned among Disney's best films, ""The Fox and the Hound"" is still the ultimate Disney friendship story, and also, an endearing classic."
48,The Fox and the Hound,8,21 April 2009,"While not the best Disney movie, this is still a somewhat charming film!","I really like this movie. The only real drawback I have with it is that despite the lovely incidental music, the opening credits were a bit too long. Another drawback is that the adult animals aren't quite as compelling as the child animals in terms of written quality. Despite these qualms, this still an immensely charming and beautifully animated film. The animation is beautiful, full of rich and colourful backgrounds, that aren't quite as good as Lion King and Bambi, though the bear is a triumph of character animation. The songs are heartfelt, especially ""Best of Friends"", but they aren't showstoppers like the ones in Beauty and the Beast. I had no problem with the voice talents. Mickey Rooney, Kurt Russell, Jeannette Nolan, Jack Albertson, (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory)Pat Buttram and Paul Winchell bring their really cute characters to life in the equally charming story of ever-lasting friendship. I will say I found the ending when Copper saves Tod's life and vice versa very moving, as well as the scenes in the forest-Widow Tweed taking leave of Tod is a real tearjerker. It did actually show that friendship isn't always forever, which is true to some extent, but loyalty is. I have heard complaints about Boomer and his friends slowing the film down, but I honestly thought their antics were really funny, and actually added to the charm that the film already had. This was one of my favourites, and still moves me, but in conclusion to me now, it is a charming film that is vastly underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
49,The Fox and the Hound,10,13 June 2008,Most Underrated Disney Movie Ever,"It's funny, it's heartwarming, it's heartbreaking and it's so wonderful. The Fox And The Hound sure is the most underrated Disney movie ever.A little fox orphan is found by Widow Tweed, a nice old lady. She keeps him as a pet and names his Tod. A few days later Tod meets a hound dog named Copper in the woods. They become friends and play together, but Copper's owner, Amos Slade, wants him to become a hunting dog and he hates Tod. Their friendship just isn't meant to be. Amos takes his dogs Copper and Chief to a hunting trip and when they return, both Copper and Tod are grown up. But are they still friends now that Copper is a fully trained hound dog or will nature itself break this friendship apart? The Fox And The Hound made me laugh and cry like no other movie. It is the perfect Disney movie for so many reasons. Like other movie before or after he took hearts by storm. Even though there might be no happy end.Rent it, Watch it, Love it."
50,The Fox and the Hound,8,9 June 2007,"One of the best, but its too short!","The Fox and the Hound is one of my favorite Disney movies, and watching it as a child, I found a lot to love about it. Just recently however, I got the opportunity to watch the movie again, and I was able to find new things about the movie that I wasn't able to find nearly a decade ago when I saw the movie for the first time. Unfortunately one of the first things I noticed about the film after I watched it again was that, at just under an hour and a half running time, the film tried to cram too much plot into too little time and space, making the plot of the film feel rushed and too fast paced. Take for example the relationship between the fox protagonist Todd and his new friend Vixey, the two meet, play together, and the next thing the viewer knows, Vixey wants to have a family with Todd, they are staying up watching the moon rise, and then they spend the night together at Vixey's home. Although all this took up in the film universe just under a day, all the above took up just about ten minutes of film time, and Disney Studios easily could have tagged on another ten minutes at the most to flesh out the relationship and not have it feel so rushed. Aside from that, the Fox and the Hound has memorable characters, great music, and a moral story."
51,The Fox and the Hound,8,27 October 2006,Neglected Little Jewel,"Actually not bad at all. The movie comes after the truly sad period at Disney during the 1970s--recycled characters AND animation from past films. (shudder) It's too depressing.Most say that the studio really began to get its groove back with the GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, 1986, but I really think the start of the renaissance was THE FOX AND THE HOUND. The lush backgrounds are reminiscent of BAMBI (and hard-core fans will see two tips of the hat to BAMBI --NOT recycled animation) and I think the characters of Copper, Tod, and Widow Tweed are beautifully animated.The story involves the friendship between a fox cub and a puppy destined to be a hunting dog, and of course, things go to hell, and partially resolve at the end.Some people have commented the level of violence may be too much when these two grow up and face off, but frankly, unless you have a VERY impressionable young kid you really don't have to worry. Don't get me wrong -- the fight scenes are harrowing, especially when a wounded grizzly bear is thrown into the mix--but I think it just adds to the drama.The ""messages"" are all good. . .the most important one being that blind hatred either cripples you or eventually gets you killed.The only thing I didn't like is the truly awful songs. Thank God there's only three of them. Otherwise, I would highly recommend THE FOX AND THE HOUND."
52,The Fox and the Hound,,16 August 2006,A Somewhat More Melancholic Film from The Disney Studios,"After 1977's ""The Rescuers"" soared critically and commercially, Disney felt more confident in animated features at a time when the medium seemed to be on its deathbed. Thankfully, other animated features at the time scored big: Ralph Bakshi's ""Lord of the Rings"" (1978) and Martin Rosen's ""Watership Down"" (1978). Other films failed though, as the 80s rolled in, things seemed to get worse.""The Fox and the Hound"" was not an easy book to adapt, and this ended up frustrating several people who worked on the film. ""The Rescuers"" was a film that showed ambition and had excitement (Which was long-awaited in a Disney film back then), but ""Fox"" seemed to be a much different story.In the film, the fox kitten Tod is separated from his mother, who is shot. He is adopted by the Widow Tweed, as she raises the kitten. Tod then meets Copper, a hound dog owned by the hunter Amos Slade. Amos Slade is a trigger-happy nut who already has a disdain for Tod after chaos on his farm. However, Tod and Copper develop a strong friendship, until Copper has to leave on a hunting trip.He returns as a grown dog, and he tells Tod that they can't be friends anymore. Big Mama, Tod's friend, tries to convince him beforehand that Copper won't be his friend forever. Tod doesn't agree, but pretty soon, he finds himself at odd ends with his friend after causing Amos' older Chief to nearly die. Thus Copper swears revenge. From there, ""The Fox and the Hound"" takes off. It's a much darker story, as it's mostly unhappy throughout. The main theme in this film is acceptance, as Tod begins to accept that time changes things. He loses his best friend, and Widow Tweed later has to abandon him. The last part of the film is Tod's life in the forest and how he falls in love with Vixey.The love story seemed a bit contrived and rushed, but it was acceptable. Unfortunately, Copper still believes Tod caused Chief to get injured, (He was originally going to die, which I think, would've made the story more intense) so he still wants revenges. Amos and Copper go into the game preserve to hunt Tod down, leading up to a surprisingly intense climax where Tod and Copper's fight is interrupted by an angered grizzly bear. The bear scene shows some of the strongest animation in any Disney film, and at the time, the animation looked better than anything else in the animation industry during that era, as it came close to the Golden Age Disney classics in terms of the animation.""The Fox and the Hound"" ends with a somewhat unhappy ending, a first for a Disney film. Tod and Copper live separately, but are still friends at heart. This ending was suitable, again, playing into the whole theme of acceptance. Some looked at this film as a critique on social situations and how people quickly disregard others based who they are. I say that critique is actually true.Here is a Disney film with a melancholic and often heartwarming story, two strong lead characters and stellar animation. One thing that did not work was the comic relief with the two birds Dinky and Boomer. They were obviously added to give the film a lighter side, it ultimately backfires, as these bumbling birds do nothing but pursue a crafty caterpillar. One exception was when they get fried by a telephone phone, otherwise the rest didn't really work. The love story felt a little contrived. The songs were definitely not the strongest. ""Hunting Man"" was rather silly but enjoyable, ""Goodbye May Seem Forever"" was one of the better songs, along ""Best of Friends"". I found ""Lack of Education"" to be quite funny, but a bit of an unnecessary way of executing the scene where Big Mama tells Tod that Copper won't be his friend forever. The score was alright, but it feels a bit dated. It works well in the film, though.""The Fox and the Hound"" was a film with a troubled history (The departure of Don Bluth and 14 animators, the delay and many other factors) and it ultimately works while it has some pretty good-sized flaws. Overall, it's a surprisingly melancholic film coming from Disney with a lot of redeeming qualities. It's a good Disney film that is definitely worth it.A 9.2 out of 10."
53,The Fox and the Hound,9,17 June 2006,"Darker, not quite your usual Disney fare","When I first saw this movie as a child, I remember I thought it to be a little too slow but yet interesting. I have come to like the movie much more since I was a teenager and had experienced losing friends over time. I think this film is more mature than most Disney pictures and maybe this is why it took me a while to warm up to it. I had to have the experience first before I could truly relate.I have noticed that the darker Disney movies, such as Pinocchio, the Black Cauldron, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Fox and the Hound and also to some extent Sleeping Beauty were always more special to me than the normal Disney fare. Maybe this is, because they came a bit more unexpected.The animation is very good, I think. Sure, it is nowhere near that of the early Disneys and also not as good as the animation done in the nineties, but it is a large step forward from ""Robin Hood"" and ""The Rescuers"" I think the saturated and natural colors really fitted the mood, even though the backgrounds were static.I read in many comments, that this is a wonderful tale of friendship. I think what is even more important about the movie is that it shows that hatred or the feeling of despising one another because of difference between people is learned. Remember, Copper does not hate Tod before he goes on that hunting trip. After that he is changed, there is no hate yet but he says he has to stick to the convictions and a fox and a hound cannot be friends, the have to be enemies. Only after Chief's accident does this really turn into hate. Had Copper not undergone his education, his first thought after the accident would never have been that Tod had wanted to hurt chief deliberately.It may be a little far fetched to show this in a fable since after all, foxes and hounds are not just different races but different species. But since many people feel moved by the picture, it must have worked. I think this is even more important message than the one on friendship, for it shows the true reasons of racism, or even contempt between different classes.This is not a movie that shows your typical blah blah ""friendship is what's most important"", ""everything is fine if only you got love in your life"" message as so many other Disney movies or so called kid's movies from the United States do. It is more complex and goes a lot deeper and for that, it is really special to me."
54,The Fox and the Hound,9,9 June 2006,"Not the typical happily-ever-after Disney shmoe, but nonetheless magical","Coming from a girl who was your typical Disney-Princess-Wannabe around the time she first watched ""The Fox and the Hound"", this movie probably won't mean as much to younger kids as it will to those revisiting old classics from their childhood. As the movie is a masterpiece for its intruism (I know, thats not a real word)rather than its fantasy, children younger than six most likely would rather watch ""Cinderella"" or ""The Lion King"". The fact that the movie also doesn't have the typical happy ending (Todd and Copper stay friends, but must lead lives separate from one another) may also have something to do with its lesser popularity among young children. I'm thirteen years old right now, and only yesterday I was watching this film, which I came across while rooting through some of my old movies. I was surprised at how moved I was by it, particularly when Copper turned against Todd and was helping Amos set the traps around the game preserve, and even slightly embarrassed that a child's movie could affect me so (like I said, I'm thirteen, the age of the ever-existent peer-pressure-to-be-cool). Though I could remember many of the scenes almost perfectly, I couldn't remember identifying with the characters as much before; I'm not saying that the emotion went completely over my head when I was younger, but I'm just saying it affected me more this time around. This is a beautiful story of how strong and innocent friendship can be, and is one that deserves a lot more credit than it is given."
55,The Fox and the Hound,10,26 October 2005,This is a wonderful movie,"I love this movie. It is a wonderful display of friendship and love. The characters are just plain adorable. They show innocence and love. When they got older, their innocence went away, but their love didn't. They cared about each other still but they were friends in a different way. It was cute, fun, and very enjoyable. Copper and Tod are a great example of how I think people should treat each other. It also is a movie about problems that used to be. There are classes. You can't mix the classes. I disbelieve that. Just as this movie proves, it shouldn't matter what you're supposed to think, who you're supposed to be friends with, it should only matter if you like each other and want to be friends.If you are very, very emotional like me, watch it with a box of tissues."
56,The Fox and the Hound,10,11 October 2005,The True tale of Friendship,"About twelve years ago when I saw this movie I was only four years old. At that time I watched the movie for the sake of watching it. Today, I watch it as the true untapped story of Friends. This movie inspires me so much, that my friends may be different someday, but it isn't impossible to not lose them. I've never seen another movie touch me in the way that The Fox and the Hound did. It made me realize just how important friends are. I think that if i had known what was going on twelve years ago, I would have never stopped crying. Through this masterpiece I learned that all great friendships have a trial. This proved that everyone can succeed in the trial. This line still hits me to this day: ""Copper, you're my very best friend,"" ""and you're mine too Tod,"" ""and we'll always be friends forever, wont we?"" ""Yeah, forever."" ...wow I am in awe from it."
57,The Fox and the Hound,,27 January 2002,Very sad..........,"This was the first and one of the only movies I have ever cried in. I love animals and the poor fox's face dropping when his best friend doesn't want to know him anymore still makes me cry. It's a good movie, but even though I know it has a happy ending I can't bear to watch it often."
58,The Fox and the Hound,,2 January 1999,a great rainy day movie,"the fox and the hound will forever be one of my favorite cartoons.  it is done with such childlike simplicity that it enables ""children of all ages"" to enjoy it.  the story of two unlikely friends, and how they are separated will touch the lives of all who see it.  a great ""rainy day"" movie."
59,The Fox and the Hound,7,27 September 2014,The cutest friendship,"So this movie is basically about a bromance and friendship between a fox and a hound. The problem is, one is trained to be a hunter and the other is a prey for the human hunter. I my personal opinion the main aspect that drives this movie is the cuteness and the relationship between the animal characters. Also the bond when it comes to friendship is actually heartwarming in this. When it comes to friendship, the test of time plays a big part. The development and the animation is also really well done. There are no musical numbers (well there is, but it's very subtle) or anything like that, this is strictly based on the development of the friendship. Even if some parts seem to be drawn out, like the birds and the caterpillar parts. Overall, this movie plays a part in my childhood memories for a reason, even if it's slightly. I don't know, I like these types of stories, where the relationship between 2 shouldn't be but it happens. And how certain circumstances makes things a bit complicated.7.5/10"
60,The Fox and the Hound,7,22 August 2007,The Fox and the Hound of Disney,"I saw ""The Fox and the Hound"" for the first time when I was 11 and I loved it. But after watching it several times I got sick of it and didn't saw it again until now.I enjoyed this movie again. It's not an instant Disney classic like for example ""Snow White"", ""Bambi"", ""Jungle Book"" etc, but still a very sweet and enjoyable movie. The animation looks good, I especially love the opening, it's breathtaking. The style it's a mixture of the style from the 40's and 70's (in my point of view).This movie doesn't contain any big flaws, but there are parts of the script who could have been a little more developed. The dramatic parts are really dark and sometimes the film is a little bit bittersweet, but it doesn't disturb the movie.While the songs are anonymous comparing to other Disney songs (exept the ""Best of Friend"" song), is the score quite good; a little bit quirky, bittersweet and country-like.HERE COMES SOMETHING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SPOILER: This movie it's similar to ""Bambi""; nature settings, animal protagonists who grows up and being hunted of humans, etc (and this film has some scenes who is actually borrowed from ""Bambi"" if you watch closely enough).This film is at times funny, but I didn't like the constant distractions of the two birds chasing the caterpillar. SPOILERS OVER Besides that, ""The Fox and the Hound"" it's a enjoyable film that it's worth watching."
61,The Fox and the Hound,5,20 April 2014,Cheap sentiment and recycling from a better movie do not a classic make,"From the other reviews on this site and from the words of many, you would think this is an under-appreciated, bittersweet classic. I could not disagree more vehemently. This film is sentimental to the extreme, sappy and unbearable.Worst of all, it's trying to channel Bambi (1942), from the main character's mother being shot to the backgrounds to the hero mating in the wild sequence to the fierce climactic battle near the end. Unfortunately, this film is much too juvenile and trite to even come close to matching the mature and bittersweet nature of the earlier film. Yes, the first scenes in Bambi come off as somewhat cloying, but compare them to the cutesy fox and hound prancing about in this film. At least young Bambi's childhood was not accompanied by bland pop songs with awful lyrics.The characters are bland too. Tod is neither an everyman nor an interesting personality; ditto for his hound friend, Copper. The villains are dull; even the laughably lame butler in The Aristocrats made for a more memorable villain than any seen in The Fox and the Hound (1981). The other animal characters are boring too, especially two comic relief birds whose ""humorous"" subplot involving a worm which becomes grating.The songs are unmemorable and lazy. The animation is typical of the Disney Dark Age (1970-1988), sketchy, which seems to be a love-hate deal for many. The only aspect I found praiseworthy were the backgrounds (from my experience, it seems even the worst or most mediocre Disney films are bound to have nice backgrounds).This movie is the essence of overrated, a Twinkie being auctioned off as a delicacy. A bittersweet ending and sad-eyed animals are not enough to make your movie mature or artistic."
62,The Fox and the Hound,6,13 April 2014,"Fine for kids, not enough here for adults","It's a pretty safe bet that all of you know the basic plot behind Disney's 24th full-length animated picture ""The Fox and the Hound"" (1981), even if you haven't seen it yet. A baby fox, whose mother just got killed, is discovered by a kind old lady named Widow Tweed. Seeing that he needs a motherly figure to take care of him, Tweed adopts this baby fox and names him Tod. Next door, a hunter named Amos Slade (Jack Albertson, aka Grandpa Joe from ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971)) has just bought a new hound puppy named Copper for his hunting dog Chief to train. One day, Tod and Copper start becoming play buddies and eventually declare they want to ""be friends forever"". Trouble ensues however when Amos insists that Copper (Kurt Russell) stays home where he belongs and Tod (Mickey Rooney) accidentally causes too much trouble for both Copper and Tweed. Will Tod and Copper's relationship stay the same, even when they'll become the biggest enemies when they're all grown up?""The Fox and the Hound"" is another one of those films where the filmmakers are mostly efficient in terms of telling the story, and yet one can't shake off a feeling of emptiness after watching it. You have outstanding film legends such as Mickey Rooney and Jack Albertson supplying stellar voice-over work. You've got the good old Disney visuals with their lush colors and backgrounds along with their warm and expressive character animation. You also have a story that supplies a good lesson for kids regarding the values of friendship. There are a handful of things like the ones I just listed that should make ""The Fox and the Hound"" good enough for me to recommend. But then, there was an unmistakable emotion I was feeling while watching it again years after I last viewed it. This emotion I'm referring to is, for lack of a better word, boredom. Yes, even solid voiceovers, nice animation and an admirable premise can't quite save a film like ""The Fox and the Hound"" from being so drenched in averageness. You'll notice that I didn't even go into detail regarding the other supporting characters in this film. Don't worry, you're not missing a thing. I highly doubt that anyone, including myself, will even remember they were even there let alone remember their ""necessity"" to the narrative. So, let's just leave it at that. As for the film's songs, I don't remember one. There were even one or two cases where a song was clearly there, but I just had to listen carefully since I didn't hear singing. Not like the Disney music we're used to, is it? But whatever songs were clearly sang, they were all fairly dull anyways. In short, the songs and side characters could have easily been scrapped considering they're hardly even there to start with. The stronger aspects of this Disney flick reside whenever we focus on the complications that arise between these two friends when they're all grown up. You couldn't have asked for a better ending for this film if you tried. It stays true to the relationship between Tod and Copper without betraying the audience by completely making them into something they're not. Tweed's also an intriguing parental figure for Tod in that she goes back and forth between being very forgiving of Tod's mischief and trying to teach Tod to avoid getting in trouble. Aside from that, there really isn't much else to discuss regarding ""The Fox and the Hound"". It's a harmless flick for little kids to see one time, but not much else. Take my advice for what it's worth. Not one of my favorites from the Disney canon."

64,The Fox and the Hound,6,1 December 2017,Disney's star-crossed friends,"The Bad:So I've heard that the ""hidden theme"" of this movie was inter-racial friendship. If so, it was a VERY hidden theme as I don't think anyone would realize this without being told. Also, it has an extremely poor message of pro-segregation, if you were to analyze the film this way. However, since I don't think any small child is going to grasp that kind of message, I think it's worth ignoring that theme and taking this film more literally  evolving friendship and loss that happens to all of us over time. And since that theme is a good thing, so I'll address it more in the next paragraph. Moving on to other 'bad' things: the music in this is...folksy. Not a style with a huge following, and not one I care for. The animation is not particularly beautiful either. There is a bit of an anti-hunting message, but again, not strong enough to be a problem for those who disagree, I think. The love interest is very bland and there's no lead-up to the pair falling in love, but I don't think you can expect much from a pair of foxes!The Good:Coming back to the movie themes, I find the idea of childhood friends growing apart and ending up in different places (literally or metaphorically) is a realistic and important idea to explore in film and I think this movie does an okay job at that. Granted, there's an interlude of serious antagonism before the resolution, which hopefully won't be found in our children's relationships, but the bittersweet ending is one that I think can resonate with children who have moved or known grief. This is also one of the most realistic of Disney's animated films (talking animals not withstanding). There's no magic, no real villains (not even the dog's owner is really a bad man). Just two animals who are figuring out how the world works and what their place in it is. And, coming back to themes, there is the underlying sense that without outside interference, the animals would have stayed good friends. But that's life  no one lives in a bubble and things outside our control can impact us. The ending isn't a happy one, but it is a realistic and satisfying one. The Mom View:I feel like this is a forgotten Disney classic. Not one of their most famous films, and it probably deserves to be ranked somewhere in the lower middle range of their animated movies. But I still like it and feel it's worth ensuring my kids are familiar with. The friendship that defies the normal way of things is a cute, sweet part of the movie. The depth of misunderstanding (which is never adequately resolved, but is forgiven) can get overly intense and the bear can be down-right frightening for young children, so I'll have my kids see this when they are middle elementary age. Overall, not my favorite Disney animated movie and not one a child would miss if they never saw it, but it's not bad and worth renting. 6/10"
65,The Fox and the Hound,7,10 October 2017,A bitter-sweet story of friendship and identity.,"This is a charming movie with a couple of very strong scenes, but it also has a couple of flaws that really drags it down. Let us start with the good stuff. I still find the colours pretty and true to the forest and rural environment without being on par with Bambi for example. The owl, Big Mama is a likable and sincere side character and adviser for the young Tod. The human characters are good as opposites to one another. The establishing of the friendship between a fox and a hound is generally a good premise, because in the countryside setting of the movie they are naturally hunter and prey. It really begins when Tod grows up. He gets in trouble with the movie's antagonist, Amos Slade, and it forces Tod's owner to take him back to the forest in a heartfelt tear-jerker scene. When he is chased by Copper and the older dog, Chief, it is really intense. But here is my major problem with this movie. The point of no return part of the movie also leads to maybe the most disappointing anti-climax in Disney history when Chief falls off a bridge. Watch the movie and you will know. To the bad stuff. In short, the side characters, Boomer and Dinky are just the most forgettable ones and do not serve a remarkable purpose in the movie. Every time I watch it, I don't remember a word they said and didn't care that much of their antics. As said, those two parts of the movie have always been bucking me. But aside from them it is a recommendable watch for the family with some chilling scenes and likable characters."
66,The Fox and the Hound,8,6 September 2017,A Sad Lesson for All of Us,"First of all, the critical issue here is the way we treat one another based on things we can't control. Tod and Copper were born to be enemies, but as little ones ignored all that. But as they grew they were forced to forget their empathy. It's truly sad how we often treat one another based on the superficial. The downside, if one wants to take this seriously, is that these are natural adversaries, and in the natural setting, would not hesitate to kill. One could say that Disney's pairing of them is a bit unfair. Even in a Biblical sense, people and animals carry labels, and, in some circumstances, it is said that it's the way things are. But I think the former message prevails here. This is a good film for young children to absorb that sense of the clash of differences which can be deadly."
67,The Fox and the Hound,7,13 August 2017,Change of the Guard,"After Walt's death, the Disney animation studio struggled to stay in business and produce wholesome entertaining pictures. While they were harmless and enjoyable entertainment, films like The Aristocats and Robin Hood lacked the cohesive narratives of the films that had Walt's involvement (this was remedied with the release of The Rescuers). The style and look of films had stagnated as well. The xerox technology that streamlined the animation process gave the films a scratchy and unfinished look. This was the style of the Disney films for nearly 20 years with no change nor progress.The release of The Fox and the Hound changed the studio had been going. This was the last film to have prominent involvement of Walt's top artists and writers, some of whom had worked at the studio since the 1930's. Many new artists had been working at the studio for a few years. Thus this film was a transitional film from the old guard to the new. Although from many insider accounts, this transition was not a smooth one. Don Bluth, one of the top artists from the new guard, decided to form his own studio and take many of the animators with him. This delayed the release of this film by a few months.Fortunately, these complications did not affect the overall film. Like The Rescuers that preceded it, this film turned out a strong cohesive narrative. I'm surprised that it hasn't been mentioned much in recent years, but the story has a darker and more mature tone and theme to it than most Disney films of the previous decades. While great liberties were taken in adapting the source material, the writers managed to create a compelling theme of two friends who aren't aware they're naturally supposed to be enemies and how they confront the issue as adults.The artistry of the Disney films finally started to show progress starting with this film. The animation no longer has an unfinished look. I presume the xerox photography had advanced so that they were able to xerox colored lines like those that appeared in the features in the 1940's and 50's. This artistic progression would continue at a great rate for the next several years.While it was critically acclaimed at the time of release and a subsequent reissue, this film hasn't been held in high esteem by fans or the Disney company itself in recent years. The films greatest strengths are the theme of a strong friendship threatened by external circumstances and the fact that there isn't a happy ending, but a bittersweet one, which is unconventional for a Disney film in a way. Definitely worth watching, like most features released after Walt's death, this one is underrated."
68,The Fox and the Hound,,10 April 2017,Friendship Tested,"Best friends as infants, a hound dog and fox inevitably grow up to be mortal enemies in this popular animated film from Walt Disney Studios. Some of the hand drawn animation is quite breathtaking, the animal characters are endearing and the dramatic crux of the film works well, however, this is seldom regarded as one of Disney's better animated movies with good reason. The attempts to inject humour into the bleak tale work less than half the time, the songs are not especially memorable and having the fox's owner narrate her sentimental thoughts aloud actually subtracts from the immediacy of a key scene. The most awkward aspect of the film is the inclusion of a love interest for the fox. Sandy Duncan's vocal performance is decent enough, but her vixen character adds nothing to the film and the scenes of the two foxes romancing once another are so far removed from the fox/hound central story that the movie comes to a near stand-still. The upbeat ending additionally feels entirely wrong given how grim and serious the film is at its best. And there are some surprisingly graphic scenes here - most notably a train tracks accident. It is hard not to wonder what may have been here had Disney chosen to milk the dramatic potential of the material for all that it is worth. Apparently, the film differs quite largely from the book it is based on as it is."
69,The Fox and the Hound,4,13 February 2017,The hunt is off,"The concept of this story could have worked as a dialogue-free Fantasia piece, but Disney's attempt to mold it into a ""family movie"" spoils whatever credibility it might have had. Tod (short for toddler) is a newly-orphaned baby Fox adopted by Big Mama, who lives out in the wilderness. He soon meets his neighbor Copper, a bloodhound owned by a cantankerous old codger who mistreats and kills animals for fun. Tod and Copper are supposed to hate each other, not as much as I hated suffering through this.There are some lovely forest backdrops and occasional atmosphere in its favor, though this ranks close to the very bottom of Disney's animated movies. Why on Earth was 147-year-old Mickey Rooney cast as the voice of Tod? Who in their right mind thought that this was a good idea? Kurt Russell also has very recognizable vocal chords but casting him as Copper simply doesn't work. The score by Buddy Baker (who?) is obnoxious, loud, intrusive, and does the film no favors. Several character concepts are obviously Shanghaied straight from Winnie the Pooh. Strange to think that this is the first Disney movie to utilize CGI animation though, if only very briefly.I just didn't feel that there was much at stake to give a damn about any of this. The Fox and the Hound really is one of Disney's laziest ""efforts"". As I said, a Fantasia segment that sticks close to Daniel Mannix's novel or even a Silly Symphonies short would have been better than this tedious bore. I can't believe it took EIGHT writers to adapt this into such a weak screenplay. Most certainly the kind of movie you watch on a grey Sunday afternoon in February."
70,The Fox and the Hound,5,6 November 2007,"Not characteristically optimistic or positive, and may leave you unfulfilled, though feeling respect for its powerful theme.","This movie is not characteristically optimistic or positive, and I would warn parents and adults interested in viewing a Disney film to be lifted in spirits that THE FOX AND THE HOUND may not be the best choice.While watching I felt it heavy emotionally and overly sad, without much relief. The ending left me unfulfilled.Summarily, it's not that fun, not very optimistic, and on the heavier and sad side of the Disney films.It does, though, teach that change can be good and demonstrates the powerful bond of childhood friendship. Additionally, I felt great respect for the depiction of its powerful theme, that sworn enemies can care for each other, as taught through the innocence of childhood."
71,The Fox and the Hound,6,19 October 2002,A beautifully made but predictable film.,"A beautifully animated cartoon, with loving attention to detail and bright, pleasing colors....but the story is overly predictable. Kids will probably like this, and adults will have a passable time, but don't expect anything in the realm of ""Alladin""...(**1/2)"
72,The Fox and the Hound,5,30 August 2006,Decent Disney animation but not one of my favorites...,"I'm not sure if the target audience for this one is young kids because there's quite a bit of violence and a rather bleak ending to the story, so I can't recommend it as one for the kiddies.But as an example of Disney animation, it harks back to the simpler Disney drawings of the early films and is notable for being the last Disney film featuring the work of Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston who worked on so many of the early classics. Indeed, it proved that the art of animation was still alive and in the hands of new artists who knew exactly how to deliver the goods.The voices are especially well done, as they are in most Disney films, particularly MICKEY ROONEY as Tod, KURT RUSSELL as Copper, PEARL BAILEY as Big Mama and JEANETTE NOLAN as Widow Tweed.The songs are nothing special and that's one area where the film fails to maintain a high level--but the animation is excellent, the color is fine, and the story--while a bit slow paced after a promising start--winds up in a brisk 83 minutes.Summing up: Good but not great."
73,The Fox and the Hound,3,8 April 2005,Ech!! It stunk on ice.,"I somehow went 24 years of this movie's existence without having ever seen it until tonight. I should have waited 24 more. Everything about this movie was sub-par Disney. First off, the animation. Not bad for the whole movie, but certain scenes definitely had a rough 'skethcy' appearance to them, and other scenes with a lot of motion appeared kinda herky-jerky. Secondly the soundtrack. The songs were awful. Awful lyrics, perfectly forgettable melodies, and almost non-existent accompaniment. Aside from the lyrical songs, I found the rest of the soundtrack to add so little to the movie that I actually noticed how lacking it was. A good soundtrack enhances the movie without making you think about it. This one made me think about it all the time. Thirdly, the characters. Disney seems to have pulled out all the stops on the 'cliche-maker' assembly line in this category. Every character is paper thin, you could summarize every facet of each character in a single sentence. (Ex - ""grouchy old hunter out to get fox"" or ""kindly old farm widow"") Fourth, the dialog - pretty darn bad. The first fifteen minutes of the movie seemed to contain nothing but the old man and old woman talking to themselves out loud while interacting with the animals. Fifth - Aren't Disney cartoons supposed to be funny? Not necessarily a laugh riot from start to finish, but maybe it could make me laugh twice. They really only got me to laugh once in the whole stinkin' movie. Okay, I could probably go on just a little more - but I think the point is made. Stick with Robin Hood, Little Mermaid, or any one of two dozen other really well done Disney flicks - this ain't one of them. (Neither is 'Hunchback' if you're wondering what other Disney flicks I think are unworthy.)"
74,The Fox and the Hound,10,10 December 2016,A Classic Disney Masterpiece!,"If you ask for a Disney animated classic suggestion well here's ''The Fox and the Hound'' all things was great for an animation movie; the songs, the music score, character voicing (I actually like this movie in french translation because I was used to listen like this when i was a child and it was well done in my opinion), a strong message was excellent.It is my Favourite Disney movie, the best of my childhood in my old Disney VHS's my favourite was this one and not only my favourite Disney movie it is also one of my favourite of all time. Probably the best of its generation. It is a Disney Masterpiece and i cannot see why someone would disagree on that. I think it should be higher than 7,3/10 it should be like 8/10 or 7,6 at least. Even in my life I had my best friend in my childhood I know him like 13 years ago in the time we grew up and having different thinking but we are still friends after all and I always think about this movie and thinking of my childhood.A good animation movie to watch."
75,The Fox and the Hound,9,1 May 2016,Cult following? Absolutely deserved.,"This film, despite the flaws that several critics give it, is one of my favorite Disney movies so far. In fact, it started my fascination with red foxes due to its combination of light and dark. This is more of a PG film, as I was genuinely horrified by pictures of Tod snarling at Copper, not to mention thematic elements, peril, and animal/firearm violence. That is one of the main reasons why I just adore this movie, but it is simultaneously an era of change for Disney, as Don Bluth left during development and a combination of old (Wolfgang Reitherman) and new (John Musker, Ron Clements, Glen Keane, John Lasseter, Tim Burton, Brad Bird, and even Joseph Barbera and Iwao Takamoto) faces would contribute to the animation. The songs are slightly forgettable but are still very fun or provoking to listen to (particularly Goodbye May Seem Forever), and despite the failures of Dinky, Boomer, and Squeeks as comic reliefs, the drama more than makes up for it. You will not regret seeing it, even if you don't like foxes or some of the big name actors in the film (Paul Winchell, Mickey Rooney, Corey Feldman, and Sandy Duncan are some examples)."
76,The Fox and the Hound,10,11 April 2016,A great Disney classic,"In the beginning of the film, Tod, an abandoned baby fox, is found by a kind elderly woman who decides to take it in and raise it. Meanwhile, her neighbor brings home a new pup he names Copper that he intends to raise to be a hunter. Tod and Copper meet and become instant friends, until Copper goes away on a hunting trip with his master; when he comes back, both he and Tod have grown, events unfold and eventually Tod becomes the object of Copper's hunt, testing their friendship and loyalty in a very moving way. It sounds like a simple story but it is actually very deep and this is one of the most adult Disney movies I know; it touches on issues like friendship, loyalty, identity, loneliness, growing up and societal rules. The music is subtle and fits nicely, especially the devastating Goodbye May Seem Forever that plays during one of the most heartbreaking scenes I've seen in a Disney movie. It's too bad that this movie has become a bit forgotten because it does deserve to be seen; it is bittersweet and realistic and what I like about it is that it is all about the characters and the story. Just make sure to have tissues ready."
77,The Fox and the Hound,10,2 February 2016,My favorite movie of all time,"This is one of those movies that made me an addict of this movie. This movie is also the reason why I love foxes. I wish I could own one. That's how much I love them. What I also love about this movie is the voice actors. How did they ever get Mickey Rooney and Kurt Russell to be Tod and Copper? I loved it. Also, at the part where Tod and Copper have a skirmish after setting off a series of traps, that one angle where Tod has his teeth vulgarly exposed was my favorite part out of the whole thing. Disney doesn't mess around when it comes to fights. Especially with teeth fights, and bear skirmishes. Honestly, Disney definitely knew what they were doing."
78,The Fox and the Hound,7,3 October 2009,"Not great, but still adorable and heart-warming.","Ah, the classic Romeo and Juliet story- warring families, two companions, tragic endings. The Fox and the Hound has a very powerful message, brought together with sweet animation and Disney storytelling that no one can top. This is a very good movie, although I wouldn't rank it as high as films like Pinocchio or Lady and the Tramp.Musically, this film leaves a lot to be desired. It just doesn't have the same memorable tunes as some of the other Disney films. The score seems rather generic... nothing really special. However, the voice acting of young Copper is just precious.The animation was bit plain for my tastes, but not all of it was bad. For example, the way young Tod and Copper were animated as pups was absolutely adorable! In fact, this movie would probably get more, ""Awww,""s than laughs. The subplot of the birds chasing the caterpillar, in my opinion, was rather boring. I would've liked to see them focus more on building the main characters.But despite its flaws, the Fox and the Hound is truly one of the more powerful Disney films. It's message is timeless, it's characters memorable. All in all, the Fox and the Hound may not be one of the best Disney films, but it is certainly not the worse. I enjoyed it."
79,The Fox and the Hound,8,11 April 2008,A tear-jerking animated feature,"Fox and The Hound is a story between a fox and a dog who befriended each other, only to be separated by time and reunited by revenge.This movie is a family-friendly one and it teaches the value of friendship in a way that adults and little children (no not the Kate Winslet movie) alike will appreciate.The movie is an outstanding animated feature that will leave viewers with teary eyes, especially the scene where Todd the Fox and Widow are separated. It is not overly mawkish and the animation is breathless. If only an Academy Award for acting could be given to animated characters... Todd the Fox would have won it.Final say? A worthwhile family-friendly movie"
80,The Fox and the Hound,9,11 January 2004,One of the better Disney films.,"The first, and in my opinion the best of the 1980's Disney films. I first saw this shortly after it was released on VHS, back in 1996 I think. The last time I saw it was in 1999, I think. And I still wait for it to appear on terrestrial TV, with any luck. Although the story is nice and sometimes emotional, what I really like is the animation. It has the animators' dedication inside it, I can tell. The voice acting is superb, particularly from the likes of Kurt Russell, Jack Albertson and Mickey Rooney. The younger Tod and Copper are adorable to watch and are brilliantly animated and voiced, but the film is at a more oppressive side later on as they get older, and to good effect as well when they have to confront a large bear. The emotional scenes are well done indeed, enough to bring tears to anyone's eyes. Not the best movie in the world, but then again it doesn't need to be because it is still a good enjoyable animated family film. It's five years since I've seen it, but the magic and charm is still there, and I know I will be seeing it again someday. I don't know how or where, but I will see it again someday... Although the first half is a bit cutesy for some, I give it 9/10. So that means it is still well worth watching. Overall, a very nice film which is regrettably underrated."
81,The Fox and the Hound,6,2 January 2007,"THE FOX AND THE HOUND (Ted Berman, Richard Rich and Art Stevens, 1981) **1/2","For some reason, this animated feature from the Disney stable had eluded me until now - even if I remember it being shown in local theaters on original release: I understand that it's among the less well-regarded efforts, but I found it a cute little film overall; even so, the plot line (adapted from a book by Daniel P. Mannix) is somewhat thin and the songs (never my favorite element in these films) very pedestrian. As a matter of fact, it's the various endearing characters which make it watchable - and not just the titular duo (the surprising, but most capable, cast of voice actors includes such veterans as Jack Albertson, Pearl Bailey, John Fiedler, John McIntire, Jeanette Nolan, and Mickey Rooney as Tod the Fox); that said, the romantic interest which crops up during its last third proves a distraction from the central relationship - which is quite movingly developed. Ultimately, though, the animation itself seems rather flat and uninspired: it's clearly a case of ""we've been here before"" and this leads to few, if any, memorable highlights. By the way, as per the regrettable Disney Studios custom of late, a direct-to-video sequel recently appeared."
82,The Fox and the Hound,3,14 January 2006,What a waste of time.,"As to not repeat, I'm going to second everything wowarning posted. I am flabbergasted at comments such as ""under-rated"", ""heart-warming"", etc. This movie is anything but. Even the comic relief is worse than in a Star Wars movie. If anything saddens me about this movie is that I actually wasted my time watching it. I watched it as a preview for my kids. I was a bit surprised at the level of violence for a ""G"" movie. I would say it borders PG rating. Lots of gun fire (complete with near-misses and ricocheting bullets), growling/showing teeth, anger, satanic bear with glowing red eyes, biting, fighting, etc. This is definitely not for young children."
83,The Fox and the Hound,5,1 December 2015,An Alright Disney Cartoon,"Two childhood friends find themselves forced to become enemies.The newer generation of directors and animators, including John Lasseter, John Musker, Ron Clements, Glen Keane, Tim Burton, Brad Bird, Henry Selick, Chris Buck, and Mark Dindal, would finalize the animation and complete the film's production. This impressive cast of characters makes this a transitional film from ""classic Disney"" to the Renaissance period. (We do not see the signature styles of Lasseter, Burton or Selick, unfortunately.) I find the use of voices interesting, especially for Pooh fans. No attempt is made to disguise Piglet or Tigger in their new incarnations, and even Owl seems to be re-born here as (surprise) an owl. Could be worse... they could have used Corey Feldman's voice. Oh wait, they did."
84,The Fox and the Hound,,28 May 2004,nice and blah,"Nice animation (that's a pretty cool spiderweb in the intro) and the story's okay, but don't expect an adult to sit still through the whole thing. The songs are rather dull and tuneless, more like talking in rhyme, and the kid actors come across as too young. The vixen seems a bit too sugar-and-spice and, like all Disney female romance subjects, lifeless. And why don't the foxes bark? But apart from mute foxes, they got the anatomy down pretty good and I do believe it's done by the Nine Old Men and if I recall my history correctly, this was the last of the true Disney flicks...Or was that Sword in the Stone? Plot- 6/10 animation-10/10 acting-6/10"
85,The Fox and the Hound,,11 July 2001,Excellent Work!,My aunt has this film at her house. Well Copper's mean master makes him stay. Tod tries to befriend him but Copper's master told him that he can't have any friends except for his pet dog. Well Copper is a hunter. He must go wherever his master goes.
86,The Fox and the Hound,4,2 March 2012,Show to your kids with caution,"WARNING: Show this movie to your children at your own risk! OK, time to get serious. Let me make it quite clear to you web surfers that I am a big fan of Disney films, and cinema in general, but this one I have always disliked. OK, let me make it clear I don't hate it.To be fair, the artwork is decent and the voice acting matches. Even Hollywood legend Mickey Rooney put effort into his role here.But the reason I dislike this movie is because it goes from ""cutesy, cuddly and childish"" to ""dark, terrifying, malicious, sadistic, ferocious...etc."" so quickly the kids cannot suspect something is wrong.First you have Tod and Copper playing innocently, promising to be best friends forever then you have them making vicious, growling, faces and trying to bite each other's throats. This whole scene actually scared me as a 4-5 year old to the point where I didn't watch it again for years.I cannot believe scenes like this and the climax still kept the G rating! Does the MPAA just check the poster for the Walt Disney signature and say ""Well, it says Disney on it so I guess it means it gets a G rating""? And on top of that, your children will likely learn to fight as brutally as shown in this movie, Disney seems to have no respect for the fact that kids are easily frightened and often repeat what they see.To be honest, I found these scenes very appalling for a G-rated Disney flick, and I was shocked that it's seldom talked about on the internet. I honestly hope I'm not alone in my opinions here. Even my family barely feels sorry for me on this matter, but we are currently considering disposing of the VHS.So if you're a parent looking for good, family fun this isn't it. Try some of Disney's other movies, like Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh or The Lion King. At least the latter was more wholesome, used frightening images sparingly, showed little violence and taught a useful message."
87,The Fox and the Hound,10,15 October 2015,Fox and the hound,"The Fox and the Hound is an animated Disney movie made in 1981. The movie is about how a fox and a hound becomes friends. But as they grow older is becomes harder because the fox is a wild animal. And the hound is a hunting dog that catches wild animals. But against the odds they find a way to become friends again after such a long time apart. I give this movie a ten out of ten. I give the move, The Fox and the Hound, this rating because it was personally one of my favorite movies of all time when I was a kid. Another reason I give this movie that high of a rating because it is enjoyable for all ages. I recommend that you watch it because it will make the perfect movie to watch."
88,The Fox and the Hound,10,14 October 2015,The Fox and the Hound,"In the Fox and The Hound a baby fox's mother gets killed and a widow finds the baby fox and names a Tod. The widow lives next to a guy named Amos, who hunts foxes and has a hunting dog. The guy gets a puppy and named him copper, train him to hunt, the puppy finds the fox and they become best friends. Amos goes on a hunting trip to train Copper to hunt foxes and Tod doesn't think he will change. When they come back from the hunting trip in spring Copper is a hunting dog now. When Tod gets put out in the wild because the widow is scared that Tod is going to die. Tod is all alone in the wild and then meets a girl fox named Vixey. Vixey is very nice to him and they like each other but then Amos is out to get Tod and when Tod gives Amos's other dog named Chief a broken leg then Copper is out to get him. I think that this movie is very sweet and loving and it has a very good motto in the end. Little kids will love this movie and if they watch it when there older then they will find the motto easier unless the little kid is very smart."
89,The Fox and the Hound,,27 August 2015,Surprisingly adult for Disney,"The Fox and the Hound is nothing more than another Disney film about animals gallivanting around, having merry old time. At least to a child. Seen as an adult, it's a bit more than that.The movie is about two young animals. A fox named Todd, taken in by an elderly woman and nursed to adulthood as her pet. And a hunting dog named Copper, owned by a curmudgeon aging hunter. The film follows their lives through their days as two innocent young cubs and into adulthood where their roles in the so called circle of life start to assert themselves.The story itself isn't all that complicated and I'm pretty sure most of its underlying themes go straight over the head of most children. But its those themes that give this movie its depth and weight. The themes of childhood innocence, societal roles and expectations, defying one's place in the grand scheme of things, of friendship, bravery and regret. It's also one of the Disney films with an ending that isn't pure sugarcoated saccharine, fittingly so, given the subject matter.The Fox and the Hound is not one my favourite Disney films, mainly because I find the two main characters to be somewhat bland, but I do find it to be one of the subtlest Disney movies and well worth a watch as an adult even if you haven't seen it as a child."
90,The Fox and the Hound,10,18 July 2015,A Disney classic that will tug at your heart strings!,"This is Disney's 24th full length animated feature film, a movie that will tug at your heart strings. It tells the tale of a fox and hound named Todd and Copper, who have befriended each other and vowed to remain best friends. However, as time went by, Copper has been trained to be a hunting dog, thereby, putting the friendship between him and Todd at risk.It is an innocent, heartwarming and charming movie that is simply endearing, from Todd and Copper's frolicking around the forest to birds Dinky and Boomers' slapstick attempt to catch a quick-thinking caterpillar. Even the kindhearted Widow Tweed's chemistry with hunter Amos Slade is captivating to watch, especially when she tries to tame his fiery personality after Todd innocently roams around his property. The sacrificing of Todd and Copper's friendship is powerful to watch and Widow Tweed's parting ways with Todd in the forest is heartbreaking.Each of the character is carefully thought out and each has his/her own unique charm. The character development progresses very well throughout the movie, mimicking that of true human/nature emotions: companionship, friendship, joy, sorrow and survival. The hand-drawn animation is vibrant, songs are meaningful and direction is solid.It's definitely a movie that has that special Disney touch. While there is no magic, fairies, princes and princesses, this film is a captivating and uplifting story of friendship, sacrifice, survival, adventure and renewal, as well as touches of humor. It's definitely a great movie for the entire family to enjoy! Grade A"
91,The Fox and the Hound,10,10 June 2015,A childhood classic rediscovered,"This is just a classic Disney film and I would have to say one of my all time favourite movies. I've come to that conclusion because I remember watching it as a kid and loving it and now in my re-watch some 30 (ahem) years later (or so) I've enjoyed it just as much. I suppose I liked it in a different way this time around as it filled me with nostalgia but it still really made me laugh too.Its the usual Disney fare endearing and delightful, but the message here is fantastic, the dog and fox antics hilarious along with the voices of Mickey Rooney and Kurt Russell.The story follows the lifelong friendship between a fox cub and a bloodhound puppy who grow up together and then realize their friendship is doomed because Copper is a hunting dog, and Tod is his prey.Hopefully my 3 year old nephew will visit again soon and I can rediscover another childhood classic movie. 07.11"
92,The Fox and the Hound,,17 November 2011,Potential movie is ruined by a few flaws,"I am one who doesn't like to find flaws in a movie. Especially something as innocent and great as a Disney movie. But unfortunately, I found a few that bugged me.First, the beginning it implied that the fox shouldn't be with the hound, yet he dares himself and next thing you know, he's in trouble again! He rushes off and makes it to the bridge where the dog appears to die from a train wreck. The fox clearly isn't learning his lesson when he seems almost surprised to hear his used-to-be-friend saying that he'll be gotten for that.Next thing you know, the dog wasn't really dead... he just got one leg bruised despite being fallen off the bridge from great heights! Of course their owner, the old man is crazy as ever. He tries to shoot the fox while on a vehicle driven by an old lady! He gets mad when she shoots his radiator and the fox things he can get away with anything. Hence why he probably dared himself as said above.Then comes the love scene. For crying out loud why does the fox need a date? He's already screwed himself up enough and is in nature. Some grumpy animal tells him to scram so I did get mad at that point, but then the lady fox is introduced and suddenly they are almost in love, then the fox hurts her feelings, then moments later they are in love again. What?Then the hunter finally comes to kill the fox once and for all. After many scenes, finally the hunter is faced with the fox (after the fox attacked the bear that attacked the dog, hoping to somehow repay his debt) and the hunter suddenly decides he is going to be nice and gives up when the dog defends the fox. Then the hunter goes back and his leg is treated by the old lady out of no where, even though he was the enemy moments ago. And it ends... happily ever after?The final thing of course is the message that humans are evil. But I won't really give them that since people like PETA weren't stupid enough yet.Rated 6/10... :("
93,The Fox and the Hound,5,13 July 2010,The Fox and the Hound,"I remember seeing this Disney film once just to see what it was like, as I had seen the trailer and thought it looked relatively interesting. Basically young red fox Tod (Keith Coogan/Mitchell) has his mother killed by the hunter Amos Slade (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory's Jack Albertson), and old woman Widow Tweed (Jeanette Nolan) takes him to look after him. While wandering in the woods, Tod meets hound dog puppy Copper (Corey Feldman), and they quickly become the best of friends playing together. It is only when they grow up that they realise that they are meant to be enemies, Copper (Kurt Russell) has become a hunting dog along with Chief (Pat Buttram), and Tod (Mickey Rooney) is their prey. There is a point when Copper lets Tod get away, but he believes he has done wrong when Chief has an accident, and the ending is pretty gloomy when they do reunite. Also starring Pearl Bailey as Big Mama, Sandy Duncan as Vixey and John Fiedler as Porcupine. I can't remember it being all that entertaining, but as a family film and a cartoon, I suppose, from what I remember, you could see it the once. Worth watching, at least once!"
