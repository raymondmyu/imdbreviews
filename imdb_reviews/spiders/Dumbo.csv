0,Dumbo,10,8 July 2004,Short and sweet.,"All the other elephants shun Dumbo for his gigantic ears, and his mother has been locked up for protecting him, so he's all alone in the world... until Timothy Q Mouse shows up.A beautiful piece of work. At just 60 mins, it is short and sweet. But it also contains some of Disney's best visual poetry. Dumbo's not saying a single word means his entire character is created through the physical. The entire opening sequence, till the gossipy elephants start talking, plays out without words, and its like the best silent movies. Simply beautiful.Mrs Jumbo rearing up and destroying the big top to protect Dumbo from taunting kids is an incredible scene. Dumbo's mother spends the movie imprisoned in a carriage labelled ""mad elephant"" - and surely one of the most beautiful, heartbreaking scenes i've ever seen plays out when Dumbo and his mother have contact only by touching trunks, through the bars in the window of her cell. A beautiful sequence begins: the beautiful song ""Baby Mine"" plays as she cradles him in her trunk, and when Dumbo leaves she can't see him, and she stretches her trunk as far as she can out the window to try and reach him, and... oh, its too much!The pink elephants sequence is as close to trippy Disney ever got - and its brilliant. One of the best, most inventive sequences in animation history. Great song, too.Some terrific songs: Look Out for Mr Stork, Casey Junior (the train song), Pink Elephants, When I see an elephant fly and Baby Mine.10/10. Timothy Q Mouse is a great character, the animation is so concise and perfect, great songs, the message that if you believe you can overcome your handicaps you will so inspiring and beautiful, and the movie so short and sweet it will forever retain its appeal."
1,Dumbo,10,29 December 2003,A perfect film,"A perfect film.  The design is beautiful and deceptive in its simplicity. While it may lack the overstuffed quality of `Pinocchio' or the abstract one of `Fantasia,' the style of `Dumbo' is elegant, vivid, and occasionally grotesque in ways that recall not only classic circus posters but also Paul Cadmus paintings and vintage `New Yorker' cover art.  In fact, the entire production has a hint of nostalgia about it; for all its dark story elements, the film presents a rosy-hued portrait of old America (with Casey Junior cheerfully pulling his traveling circus through green open fields) that must have seemed very comforting as audiences prepared for the unforeseeable terrors of another World War.  (A `Dumbombers for Defense' poster in the film's epilogue is the one joking reference to an increasingly unsteady world situation.)  In the midst of this cozy landscape, we find a simple, tender story about acceptance and mother love, with the characters of both Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo finding a wonderful eloquence in their muteness.  These performances are true triumphs of animation.  The other characters, both good and bad, are painted with broad, memorable strokes. It's become fashionable to look rather harshly upon the Jim Crow sequence and all its uncomfortable associations, and it can be difficult for a modern audience to watch it without cringing slightly.  But it should be pointed out that the crows are not only the film's cleverest characters (both in terms of thought and language), they are also the only ones except Timothy to show any sympathy whatsoever to the little elephant; after all, they are outsiders themselves.  The sequence is a play on a stereotype, that can't be denied, but I would argue that it is an attempt to revise that stereotype into something positive and sympathetic.  The songs and score are flawless, and the show-stopping, nightmarish pink elephant sequence keeps things from getting too artistically conservative--and, just like the rest of the film, it still thrills us no matter how many times we have seen it.  10 out of 10."
2,Dumbo,10,26 July 1999,"Short, sweet, and a few pink elephants","Disney had spent vastly more money than he'd planned on ""Pinnochio"" and ""Fantasia"", and got little of it back.  ""Dumbo"", next off the rank, was made cheaply, quickly, without fuss.  The result is simple but handsome. However handsome ""Dumbo"" looks, the animation is not very detailed, character design is hardly adventurous, the colours are few but bright, and in an hour it's over.  It needn't be more than this, though: the story is far from complicated.  It is, I'll admit, a story that has made me cry more than once; and in this instance I don't feel that I've been cheated into crying, because there really is something poignant and heartbreaking about this ugly duckling variant.Like Hans Andersen, Disney has to pad the outfit a bit to make it fill the space available; yet, with the exception of the introductory bit with the storks, it doesn't feel like padding.  In fact the most gratuitous piece of padding is the most necessary.  I refer to the pink elephants sequence: a masterpiece of extended unreality (caused by such a tiny quantity of champagne!) which dazzles and sizzles and all but soars out of the screen. It's the sting in Dumbo's tail, and nothing produced since can match its verve."
3,Dumbo,10,23 September 2000,Disney's endearing classic,"One of Disney's best known and loved films. About a baby elephant born in the tough world of the circus who is ridiculed and shut out because of his large ears. Comforted by his mother until she attacks a trainer and is penned up in a jaillike wagon, Dumbo eventually learns that he can fly and becomes a star. A great film that deals with discrimination, self esteem, the importance of family and friendship. Features a great score which it won an oscar for and a nomination for song, the beautiful ""Baby Mine"" . The pink elephants scene is a classic. Wonderfully done, arguably Disney's best on a scale of one to ten...10"
4,Dumbo,10,22 February 2009,7.4????? Are you people insane???,"This is clearly one of the great animated features of all time. How it squeaks by with a mere 7.4 voter average while all sorts of contemporary crap does far better is a mystery and a tribute to the downward spiral in cinematic taste. DUMBO is my favorite of all the classic Disney films (a group which ends with JUNGLE BOOK, completed after Walt's death). Nothing since then has been able to recapture the magic. Walt may have been, according to some people, a fascist and an anti-Semite, but he was also a genius.Things that make this movie great: The animation (I used to work at a zoo, and while the real elephants did little talking or singing the animators captured their body language incredibly well.)""Pink Elephants on Parade"".Effective but not over-the-top heartstring tugging.The musical crow number (""When I See an Elephant Fly""). I'm disappointed to discover the voice actors (Including Cliff Edwards, ""Ukelele Ike"" and the voice of Jiminy Cricket) were white guys playing black --- I was hoping they were some cool unknown black combo --- but it's a terrific number anyway.The 64 minute running time. It starts, tells it's simple story, then knows when the hell to get off the stage. I wish more film makers had that ability."
5,Dumbo,9,23 November 2001,A wonderful film from Disney's classic era,"As a kid, I would watch over and over several Disney features: Pinnochio, Peter Pan, Bambi, Alice in Wonderland, Lady and the Tramp, and Dumbo. When I come back to those films now, I recognize that they are all marvelous films and gave Walt Disney much deserved success. It's truly sad how far Disney has fallen. All kids' flicks now are awful. I revisited Dumbo, by the way, on the same night that I first watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, destined to be one of the most successful films of all time. It is execrable, and it is simply pathetic how bad films like it are nowadays. I say, bring your kids back to Dumbo, Pinnochio, Bambi, and the like. They may not be as harmless as the kind of movie Disney and others shove out today. You shouldn't be afraid of your children showing emotion. I can remember more than anything being profoundly affected by the ""Baby Mine"" number from Dumbo, where he visits his imprisoned mother. Films like these will mould your children's emotional stability instead of keeping them at a safe distance and selling them toys."
6,Dumbo,10,27 May 2011,Timeless classic,"This is easily one of the most touching and entertaining films I've ever watched. From the heartwarming deliverance scene at the beginning, when the stork brings the newborn babies to all the animals in the circus, through the hilarious and trippy Pink Elephants on Parade sequence (which still holds well to this very day), to the heartbreaking scene when Dumbo's mother is in chains and she rocks him with her trunk from beyond the bars.True, I've seen it first at the tender age of 4 or 5, so maybe the nostalgia factor has it's weight on my affection for this film - but I still think it's one of the most sweet and sentimental films ever made (even at the ""old"" age of 30)."
7,Dumbo,10,12 October 2007,"Ahhh, good memories!","I used to have this on video along with ""Alice in Wonderland"" (both of them were taped off TV and were on the same video) and I remember watching them all the time with absolute and unshakable content and happiness. Peolpe have written reviews saying that it's pretty dark and creepy, especially the ""Pink Elelphants"" sequence but I never was (and I'm NOT lying!). I remember the ONLY thing that got to me a LITTLE BIT was when the clowns were chatting after the ""Dumbo the Clown"" act; the clowns with the high and squeaky voice (some of the clowns have the same voices) creeped me out a little 'cause I thought they sounded evil (Ha! For people who have watched the movie it's the voice that says ""This one's on Dumbo!"", ""We really rolled them in the aisles!"" and ""Let's make it eighty feet!""). As for the ""Pink Elephants"" sequence, I found it really funny and I still do. So anyways, absolutely no family should be without this movie 'cause it's a very sweet film with a really important message."
8,Dumbo,8,3 April 2006,The One...The Only...The FABULOUS...,"I first watched ''Dumbo'' when I was very young,and I always remembered of it being a beautiful and sad movie. ''Dumbo'' in a way,is about the rejection of being different from the others and how this can hurt so much the people who are victims of people's prejudice. The main character Dumbo,does not speak a single word and even this way, you can know all the feelings he is passing through. The illustrators did a great job showing all animal's emotions in this way.A funny thing is that since I was a kid, I always found the scenes were the pink elephants were shown a little bit of creepy. They look like the clowns who were mocking Dumbo, maybe that's why I never felt a good vibe coming from this part of the movie.This movie is a classic from Disney and everybody should watch, including adults!"
9,Dumbo,10,12 April 2001,"Excellent, but a little dark","I used to LOVE this film when I was little and then, like most other kids' films I forgot about it. However, the other night I was babysitting until 3.30am and to keep awake I invaded the family's video collection. On watching Dumbo, I was as moved as ever, but also reminded of what a scary and shadowy film it is. My brother had to be guided out of the cinema, crying with his hands over his eyes, when he saw it, and that says a lot for a kids' film. The use of shadows and silhouettes is widespread and the weather is largely rainy and stormy. I can remember being scared during the scene when the train is travelling through the stormy night and particularly when the men (all black, I notice) are building the Big Top. The Pink Elephants sequence is imaginative and impressive for adults but imagine watching it as a kid - it's pretty scary. It's strange to have a film where the main character, title character even, doesn't actually talk, but I suppose there's nothing for him to say, his actions and expressions say it all. The treatment of Dumbo's mother always gets me, particularly the beautiful and haunting ""Baby Mine"" scene. However, through all the sadness and sinisterness, the heart of the film shines through, and it's a beautiful one with a wonderful message."
10,Dumbo,8,28 November 2013,Pathos and liberation with a little help...and pink elephants,"Dumbo (1941)There's nothing new to say about this movie, I suppose, but I saw it for the first time last night at the age of 55. I've always loved the classic Disney cartoons (""Snow White"" in particular) and have not loved the more recent Disney cartoon movies (though I appreciate the animation and Robin Williams in ""Aladdin""). So I'm struggling with why this movie didn't bowl me over.It was supposed to! It's made in the middle of many American cinema masterworksthe same year as ""Citizen Kane"" after alland it's just a few short years since ""Snow White"" and one year after the amazing (if long) ""Fantasia."" (That film lost so much money, Disney made ""Dumbo"" short and on the cheap, which explains a little.)What gives? I think the movie ended up simply being ""cute"" and ""for children,"" I put these in quotes because these are good things. But they didn't work for me, sitting up alone watching it as a movie. It's great on many levels of course, including ""Elephants on Parade"" where the animation takes a spin into fantasy. But the story line is as thin as it is cloying, sad as it is obvious. It's perfect for kids of all ages, as long as they don't mind getting their heads messed up. (Kids handle it well in general, but many comment on how it deeply affects them.)One interesting thing to notice: there is a hint (that I can tell) of World War II affairs in the telling. The Ringmaster's voice is by German-born actor Herman Bing, a Nazi sympathizer who later committed suicide. His accent, famously pan- European, is toned down, but it's here. This is no social protest film, of course. Charles Chaplin, being a concerned artist type, made ""The Dictator"" the previous year. Disney, a famous patriot in the old sense (and Republican), later went on (after Pearl Harbor in late 1941) to be extremely active and generous making wartime films (propaganda films, mostly) for the government. The most famous, of Donald Duck having a nightmare about Hitler in 1943, shows what is not here to an extreme. In fact, ""Dumbo"" has become more famous for the crows being voiced by African-American actors, and a debate, easily discovered on-line, goes into how racist this may or may not be. The voices are certainly typecast in a way very common in Hollywood movies of the time. They have a huge role in the film, however, and an interesting one to dissect. It's also been pointed out that poor Dumbo is never empoweredhe never speaks, for example, but he does get drunk, poor child. Of course, he also flies. For real. And he doesn't have peanut allergies, thank goodness. That's power.So ""Dumbo"" is a brilliant trifle, a compact flexing of some great animation muscle. It is not a brilliant story but it's a very sad one for children who love their mothers (or miss them very much, as I do). It's not a very imaginative telling of the story, for the most part, or even a groundbreaking bit of animation, for the most part. But it is enjoyableyes, endlessly. It's delightful and fun and whimsical and even at times very touching, heartbreaking. Which is all it needs to be."
11,Dumbo,7,14 April 2013,4th out of 5 in the Golden Era,"Dumbo was released a year after Fantasia in 1941. This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus? This film may not be as good as the previous three, it is still a good quality film. A bit on the short side, you way to know what happens next in the plot. The characters are all endearing; Dumbo has a clear personality (even though he does not talk) and you do feel sorry for him, the mouse that helps Dumbo is a cute and entertaining character. The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid.The songs are pretty good as well. ""Baby Mine"" is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, ""When I See An Elephant Fly"" is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well.The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it.If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to."
12,Dumbo,8,9 December 2009,"""When I See An Elephant Fly""","Grimm's tale of the ugly duckling is brought to the screen by an animated baby pachyderm whose large ears make him the butt of the jokes of all the other circus elephants. But Dumbo who is accurately named because he utters not a word, makes believers of everybody. More than in most of his animated features, Walt Disney had a sharp eye for satire in this film. Note how the gossipy female elephants do harm to the young Dumbo's psyche with their wagging tongues. His only friend turns out to be mouse with voice by street wise Edward Brophy, who does a great job in vocalizing the street kid who learns to take life on the chin and as it comes.The crows here have come in for criticism by some who have said Disney was being racist in his characterization. My guess is because Cliff Edwards, a white man, was giving voice to the head crow. That's a pity because Edwards does a fine job giving voice to the best song from the score, When I See An Elephant Fly. It never reached the heights of When You Wish Upon A Star which Edwards introduced as Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio, but it sold a platter or two back in the day. I have a nice version of it sung by Jane Froman on an LP vinyl record.It was in its music that Dumbo scored his greatest success. The lullaby that Mrs. Jumbo sings to baby Dumbo, Baby Mine, got an Oscar nomination for Best Song. Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace's music got the film an Academy Award for best musical score. Personally I think When I See An Elephant Fly has had more staying power.But Dumbo itself has great staying power. It's a feel good film for kids of all ages and a testimony to those folks who never give up and make lemonade when life hands them a lemon."
13,Dumbo,8,22 January 2008,Timeless,"Some people complain that the movie isn't visually impressive or doesn't hold up to recent movies. You just can't compare them! It's OK that the animation and special effects didn't take precedence over the actual story or characters and they didn't try to build an entire movie around a breakthrough in visual effects (I'm talking to you, ""Happy Feet"").I've watched Dumbo with my 2- and 4-year-olds and they like it just as much (or more) as any new release. I think it's fascinating that the bulk of the story is told through music and the sweet body language of the baby and his mother. Of course there's some important exposition that has to be given by Timothy or the gossipy elephants but overall, the most powerful scenes are when no one says a word. ""Baby Mine"" will always bring a tear to my eye.A movie that I loved as a child and has touched a different place in my heart as a mother."
14,Dumbo,,31 January 1999,The Perfect Disney Cartoon,"This is the quintessential Disney cartoon: brief, engaging, and profound  storytelling at its finest. Where ""Snow White"" doesn't make the cut (begins with rapidly developing melodramatic plot, pauses for most of an hour to allow forest creatures and midgets to play cute, and wraps up quickly), ""Dumbo"" spins its wise lesson with elegant timing and charming characters. We all can use that magic feather once in a while."
15,Dumbo,9,7 July 2013,"""Dumbo"", the little elephant that could","I believe it's safe to say that we all have been in the same shoes as the main character of Walt Disney's 4th animated feature ""Dumbo"" (1941) at least once in our lives before. Anyone who had either seen this picture or had been picked on and/or bullied in school knows what it feels like to go through what the main character does in this film. The main reason why ""Dumbo"" has always been one of Disney's most timeless animated treasures is because so many of us can identify with the sadness and pain that the title character feels from all the unfortunate circumstances he's put under. Obviously, that isn't the only reason why ""Dumbo"" holds up well after all these years. Our main character is a baby elephant named Dumbo who is ridiculed by fellow circus animals and humans for his enormous ears. His mother Jumbo is the only elephant who is kind to Dumbo and willing to defend him. But when she gets into trouble for trying to protect Dumbo from harm, she gets locked up in a cage and Dumbo is now alone. That's when a circus mouse named Timothy comes in and becomes his only friend outside his mother. Timothy promises to do whatever he can to help Dumbo overcome his obstacle by making it into his strength. Right off the bat, I must say that it was ingenious to make Dumbo's best friend a mouse, given that elephants are supposed to be afraid of mice for whatever reasons. I loved how even though sad things keep happening to Dumbo, he's the only elephant in the circus that has a mouse for a friend. That was a very clever idea on the writer's part. I also found Dumbo's relationship with his mom to be deeply touching and emotional. The filmmakers were smart to keep the dialogue out of the scenes between Dumbo and his mom and let the heartwarming images drawn by the Disney animators do the talking. Remember a brief scene early on when Jumbo wraps Dumbo's ears into a blanket and gently rocks him back and forth with her trunk? That was a cute little scene. You couldn't make this part of the movie better with dialogue since it manages to work perfectly well as it is. Speaking of great scenes, how about that infamous pink elephants sequence? Argue all you like about how it contributes little to the plot and how a certain scene before it could send the wrong message to kids with Dumbo and Timothy accidentally consuming alcohol. That pink elephants scene is still a cool scene to watch. Considering the time in which it came out and all of the bright, colorful and surreal imagery being shown on screen, that scene was truly ahead of its time in terms of its content. In regards to the controversy involving the crows that help Dumbo discover his true destiny and whether or not they are racist, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, they were cool, free-spirited creatures who are just enjoying life. On top of that, the main leader of the group was voiced by a white person, Cliff Edwards to be precise and he did the voice-over work for Jiminy Cricket in ""Pinocchio"" (1940). So it makes the argument even less credible. Personally, nothing about these crows would've offended me if I was an African-American. If there was a scene that might have offended me if I were an African- American, it would be the Roustabouts song earlier in the film. During this song, it looks like African-American slaves are setting up the circus tents along with the circus animals. And I swear I heard these very words somewhere in the song ""We don't know when we get our pay, and when we do we throw our pay away"". They could be saying that they enjoy being hard-working slaves and they only enjoy living for that reason. To be fair, they're always shown in shadows and the lines (like the one I mentioned) seem to have a double meaning. I guess this only goes to show you how complicated race issues were and still are. In the tradition of the best Disney pictures, another one of the film's strengths is in its music and songs arranged by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace, and Ned Washington. Along with its wide range of music from softer music to circus music, the film's songs are still memorable to this day especially ""Casey Junior"", ""Baby Mine"" and ""When I See An Elephant Fly"". The music and songs have noteworthy variety to them and they are all handled very well. The animation was intended to be more basic than the three previous Disney films before it (""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Fantasia""), but it's still well done in its own right. The animation compliments the simple story that is being told very well. There's no need to remake it and advance the animation further, since it works perfectly as it is. ""Dumbo"" was intended to be a simpler film than the other three Disney animated features both with its animation and its story. And yet, it manages to top its three predecessors because it has the best balance of everything that made Disney films terrific to begin with. Even with a brief running time of just over an hour, ""Dumbo"" is more evidence that a great film which lasts over an hour is preferable to a lousy film that lasts around two hours."
16,Dumbo,6,14 November 2005,A Good 'I think I can' film for children,"'Dumbo' is one of Disney's classic films featuring an elephant with enormous ears who lives at a circus and who finds an unlikely-but-typical-pairing-for-Disney friend (a mouse, which elephants are supposed to be frightened of). The mouse provides Dumbo with confidence and a 'I think; therefore, I can' attitude to build confidence. (Such as a typical film for children's' stories.) Dumbo is supposed to be able to fly with the aid of his enormous ears.One of the best moments in this film is the scene where Dumbo gets drunk. (I'm not sure as to what parents though about this, but I can imagine that it did not go down very well.) Dumbo hallucinates over the drink and sees many marching elephants, 'pink elephants on parade.' This is a haunting and colourful little song featuring a kaleidescope of elephants.Overall, this is a memorable and lovable little film that I recommend."
17,Dumbo,10,5 August 2005,Still in my top ten favorite Disney films,"Dumbo is one of those films that works for all ages- the kids will gleefully follow along with the comic-tragic story of Dumbo and his friend Timothy Mouse; teens and young adults will want to watch it for the strange, surreal animation (and the humor, which is actually at times not quite meant for kids- i.e. the scenes with the crows); adults won't be bored by it in the least when they watch with their children. I would even equate the entertainment value of Dumbo with one of the more recent Pixar films- it's funny, but there are serious elements (in this case fairly dramatic; the animation is lively, detailed, and experimenting with the possibilities; and, its got heart behind its wit. For such a short film, it gives a lot to offer.Although not quite a fairy tale, Dumbo presents a story that most kids can identify with- the importance of having someone to look after you, fitting in, being the outsider, and accomplishing something over odds with the world. Dumbo, of course, got the name from the gossiping, talkative elephants who are shocked at ""Jumbo Jr's"" huge ears. This becomes part of the tragedy of the story, as Mrs. Jumbo (in one of the more intense scenes of the film, among others) does everything she can to protect her from the circus crowds. Dumbo is befriended by Timothy the mouse, who helps to trump him as the elephant to give the ringmaster his big ""climax"" for his act. When it goes disastrously wrong, and Dumbo is made into a clown, it leads to a night of heavy drinking between the two friends (by accident, of course kids), and this leads to one of the virtuoso sequences in any Disney film.The 'Pink Elephants' sequence, involving massive, perfunctory dream-like images of these creatures doing the strangest, most random things, is an example of something that Disney could do that could be appealing overall to an audience. Even today, there's something about the power, the danger, and the song and lyrics itself behind it that makes it effective. It has a message behind it, I suppose (maybe not to drink champagne and blow bubbles), but more than anything it adds a perfect sense of illusionment in the part of the story that needs it- Dumbo, before this scene, has had an extremely heart-felt connection with his mother (behind bars), and story-wise there has to be something that happens to him that takes him to the next step, the real discovery he and Timothy make about his future (i.e. the crows). Although much of the film is, like the circus itself, fantastical and bigger-than-life, I can't say enough about the pink elephants.Not to say that the film isn't at all dated (I even knew when I was very young watching the film that it was not of my time- the way the crows speak has an underlying racist quality to it that was acceptable in Hollywood at the time), but there is a lasting power to 'Dumbo' that works more than sixty years later. The themes are clear, the songs are enjoyable, and the tones of the film shift like the best drama/comedies of the time in regular films."
18,Dumbo,9,16 December 2016,A Tale of Love and Endurance,"When I hear ""Baby of Mine"" sung (most recently by Bette Midler), my mind goes back to the little elephant whose mother has been put away for trying to protect her baby. This is a story of relentless bullying by forces dedicated to making life miserable for Dumbo. He is naive and resilient but there is so much cruelty in his life. There is gossiping and small-mindedness by those who hold the power. Meanwhile, Dumbo and his little mouse friend try to find a niche for him in the circus. But he keeps treading on his ears and falling down. The animation is cool and some of the songs are enticing. If you love a story about and underdog (under-elephant?) don't hesitate."
19,Dumbo,,6 February 2016,Jim Crow?,"Sorry, but I don't see anything racist here--I just see crows, who are of course black, parodying humans, who come in all colors, and they are no more representative of real people than Lucy and Desi were representative of all redheads married to Cuban bandleaders or Laurel and Hardy or the Three Stooges were representative of all white men. They are funny and happen to be black, not black and therefore funny. There's a difference. (Just for the record, that's how I judge all ethnic humor: is it humor that happens to be ethnic, or is it an insult veiled in humor? I can chuckle at Chico Marx's pseudo-Italian because there's no insult intended in most of his movies--he exaggerated and put a funny spin on what he'd seen growing up. Those ""scaredy-cat black sidekick"" characters, however, leave me cold because it's implied that they're scared BECAUSE they're black, which is just not true to life.)"
20,Dumbo,,17 June 2015,"First hitch in Disney's record, but still a good movie","Dumbo was the first, but certainly not the last, time in history when the Walt Disney Animation Studio was struggling to make ends meet and thus was forced to churn out a subpar movie in terms of quality. Fantasia, the previous Disney film, had been a catastrophe in the box office, and thus Dumbo was made with a very limited budget to earn some quick cash.And it shows. As a child you probably didn't really notice, but watch Pinocchio/Fantasia and this back to back and you can see that the animation level is nowhere close. The character models are simplified, the movement seems jerky and/or too fluid, like everyone is made of melting wax, the lines are somewhat rough and even the backgrounds are not that impressive. Of course, this is only when compared to Disney's previous standards. By any objective measure this is a well-animated film.And what it loses in aesthetics, it more than makes up in characters and charm. The story of Dumbo, a young elephant born with ears way too big, is a string-tucker beyond comparison. The story is also short and sweet enough that Dumbo doesn't overstay his welcome, and contains some really memorable scenes, like the Pink Elephants on Parade or Dumbo's mom's lullaby to her son. Good stuff in general. It's not the most complex of stories, but it's a lot better than it has any right to be, given the film's rushed nature.And that's Dumbo. It's probably meant for younger children than the typical Disney film, but like most films from the self-proclaimed greatest animation studio on Earth, it has some good material for adults to appreciate as well. I'm glad this film allowed them to stay on their feet."
21,Dumbo,8,20 January 2015,Walt Disney's Classic Tale,"Growing up I watched a lot of Disney cartoon movies and Dumbo was one of those films.I watched Dumbo again for making this review and even though I haven't seen it in years it was a eye opener on how well the movie was.And I'm surprise on how a film from 1941 was able to tell a whole story in a hour and four minutes even for an animated movie that is pretty impressive.Dumbo tells the story of a baby elephant who was born with big ears, he perform the circus with his mother at his side however when she is place in a cage for protecting him from a crowd of kids.Dumbo is left alone with the other elephants showing no care for him and putting him down when he is not in the same tent. Dumbo feels lonely and sad not for long as a mouse named Timothy who tired of seeing the others pick on him because of his ears.Timothy and Dumbo quickly form a friendship and Timothy tries to find a way to help free Dumbo's mother once they make him a star.Now the movie does share the true value of friendship as shown with Timothy who is one of those friends who accept someone for who they are and don't care for those who pick on others because they're different. Looking back that is what makes Timothy the mouse a huge part to the plot as he helps the Protagonist Dumbo throughout the film.Now the plot of the film for a short classic does tell a great story about never giving up and how a true friend really cares.The animation is well done and perfectly time as well goes to show how well Disney films did for their animation films from the day.The voice acting is top notch and each actor perform very well for the characters they play.Dumbo is just one of those timeless classics that any movie fan will enjoy.Overall Dumbo is a wonderful classic with very well done animation and voice acting that help tell the story of Dumbo, The movie is fun and wonderful for the whole family to enjoyI give Dumbo an 8 out of 10"
22,Dumbo,8,16 September 2014,"Dumbo is short, but it's still very impressive.","The Walt Disney Company had made some incredible progression throughout the 1930's. The first full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, was very successful and the second one, Pinocchio, although less successful financially, proved to be a critically acclaimed hit. But because of the ongoing World War II, Disney lost a lot of money with the releases of Pinocchio and Fantasia, since the European and Asian markets were cut off. So Walt Disney had to reduce the costs for his next feature. The result was the release of Dumbo in 1941. The film only lasts 63 minutes, the animation isn't as richly detailed as the much more expensive Pinocchio and the story of Dumbo is very simple. But still, Dumbo manages to offer a lot for such a short film.Based upon the story written by Helen Aberson, Dumbo is a film about a little elephant named Jumbo Jr, although most of the other characters call him 'Dumbo'. After Mr. Stork (a stork voiced by Sterling Holloway) delivers Dumbo to his mother, Mrs. Jumbo, the other elephants make fun of Dumbo because he has enormous ears. The kids who visit the circus Dumbo and his mother perform at, humiliate Dumbo, which upsets Mrs. Jumbo, so she attacks one of the boys. She gets locked up and Dumbo is left all alone. The other elephants want nothing to do with him, because of his big ears. A mouse named Timothy Q. Mouse (voiced by Edward Brophy) feels sympathy for Dumbo and they eventually develop a friendship. Timothy envisions Dumbo as the crowning jewel on top of a pyramid of elephants. He reveals his idea to the Ringmaster (voiced by Herman Bing), while the Ringmaster is asleep. The idea fails miserably, as Dumbo makes a mistake and the pyramid falls apart, costing injuries to the other elephants. To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to Mrs. Jumbo, which leads to the emotional scene where Dumbo and his mother rejoice, although it's only for a short while. Dumbo and Timothy drink some water from a bucket, but there's some champagne in the bucket as well. They end up drunk because of the champagne and have hallucinations of pink elephants, better known as the 'Pink elephants on Parade' scene. The next morning, they wake up while they are in the top of a high tree. There are some crows in there, who make fun of them at first, but after a while they start to feel sympathy for Dumbo and help him to fly by using a magic feather, while in reality, Dumbo flew up that tree without even realizing it. When Dumbo is set for another circus show as a clown who has to jump out of a window, he looks to fly so he doesn't have to fall down. He loses his feather on his way out of the window, but still manages to fly. Dumbo becomes a hit as a flying elephant, along with his manager, Timothy. Dumbo and his mother get their own car on 'Casey Junior', the circus train.While Dumbo is not a groundbreaking picture, it's still very enjoyable. Dumbo has a lot of heart and that's what makes it worth the view. The songs are great, especially the 'Pink elephants on Parade' and the 'Baby Mine' stand out. The animation isn't as dazzling as it was in Pinocchio or Fantasia, but still features some eccentric visuals like it does with the 'Pink elephants' scene. Dumbo is a likable character. He doesn't talk, but you can easily sympathize with the little elephant. The crows and Timothy Q. Mouse make for some memorable characters that help to move the film along nicely. Dumbo isn't as mesmerizing as some of the other Disney classics, but if you're looking for some lighthearted family entertainment, Dumbo is definitely worth the view."
23,Dumbo,8,14 June 2013,One of Disney's most bittersweet classics,"Like 'Snow White,' this is one old Disney film that made me both cry and smile. I watched this film on a flight home from Dubai a few months ago after not having seen it since I was a child. Also as a child, I had a small cuddly toy of Dumbo that I was probably given when I was a baby.This film is rather sophisticated for its time due to its fluid animation and detailed backgrounds throughout. Pretty much all the songs are memorable. While the majority of them are uplifting (in particular 'Casey Jr' and 'Pink Elephants on Parade - their accompanying scenes also stand out very well,') the saddest one for me is 'Baby of Mine.' It made me cry when I was little and it still makes me cry now. Other than that, most of the characters are well-designed, especially Dumbo, Timothy Mouse, Dumbo's mother and the other female elephants; however I found the designs of the boys who taunted Dumbo and were beaten by his mother before she was deemed a mad elephant somewhat old-fashioned as well as the opening cards. Nevertheless, these aspects are forgivable for the film's era. The film's pace was relatively swift as well due to its length of just over an hour.Overall this is a timeless film that was worth re-visiting, albeit the tear-jerking 'Baby of Mine' sequence and a couple of old-fashioned aspects. 8/10."
24,Dumbo,7,23 October 2008,Everybodies favorite flying elephant.,"""Dumbo"" is one of the first full length animated movies to come out of the Disney studio's. It's also one of the shortest but there is a good reason for that. This had to be a cheap and fast production in order to compensate for the the loses long featured Disney animated movies ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"" made on their first release. It still is the cheapest full length Disney animated movie till date and it probably is also the shortest. The movie did became a success by the way at the box offices and it gained more money than both ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"" combined.It's also the first and only Disney movie that has a main character who doesn't say a word throughout the story. Nevertheless the Dumbo character really comes to life, thanks to the talent of the animators. He's an adorable and classic Disney character, with his trademark big ears and cute big blue eyes.But despite the fact that the movie is quite short (just over one hour), the movie doesn't really feel as if it's much shorter than any other Disney movie. It perhaps even feels a bit overlong. for I feel that ""Dumbo"" is a bit of a lacking movie that restrains itself too much to one location and too much on just a couple of characters. Disney movies are always filled with some really colorful and entertaining characters. ""Dumbo"" is also filled with that but most other character roles within this movie, besides Dumbo himself and Timothy, are not featured really prominently and they just randomly pop-up into the movie and are gone again. For example the crows. They are real classics but for how long are they actually in the movie? 3 minutes maybe?The story also feels really quite restrained and it's simplistic. Just think about it, what exactly is the main plot-line of this movie? Probably about Dumbo being accepted by the crowd and the other animals for what he is but this is quite thin really. When you now days come up with a story like this it goes straight into the garbage-can in the studio's executive office. It's the foremost reason why I don't enjoy watching this movie as much as any other Disney movie from around the same time period. Though it's definitely one fine and real quality movie, it's just not a movie I would like to watch over and over again.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
25,Dumbo,7,18 March 2008,"Charming cartoon from Disney with bright, circus atmosphere...","Created during a simpler, more innocent time in America when cynicism wasn't as rampant as it is today and sentimentality wasn't as shunned on screen as it is now, DUMBO remains one of Disney's simpler animated classics with a perky score and a number of catchy songs.Among the numbers that I found delightful: ""Look Out for Mr. Stork"", ""Casey Junior"", ""When I See An Elephant Fly"", ""Baby Mine"", and the two standouts in animation technique: ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" (the film's most sophisticated bit of animation) and ""The Song of the Roustabouts"" which shows the men struggling to put up the circus tents during an oncoming storm.The animation itself is more cartoon-like than Disney's earlier classics but intentionally so. In the brief span of 74 minutes, a lot of ground is covered in the story of an elephant with over-sized ears, his biggest defect, which is turned into his biggest asset by the film's end, thanks to a clever mouse named Timothy (voiced by Ed Brophy).The ""Roustabouts"" number and the ""Pink Elephants"" sequence are two of the film's high points, thanks to masterful work by the artists and the clever background score.While not in the same class with other Disney works of that era, DUMBO remains a consistently entertaining little film that should find a huge audience with its appeal to the very young as well as their elders. The music by Frank Churchill, Oliver Wallace and Ned Washington is really its major asset, aside from some very well crafted animation."
26,Dumbo,7,23 March 2006,Good movie,"This is one of the best Disney films in history, Even Oscar worthy of the best Animated film in the 1940's. Not the best film all-time, but certainly one of them. ***Spoilers***Dumbo is brought by a stork to the train where Jumbo Junior is traveling with her fellow elephants of the circus. When they see Dumbo's large ears and make fun of him, Jumbo retaliates. Later,at a circus, some kids start making fun of Dumbo, and his mother tries to protect him, but she is taken away as a ""mad"" elephant. Dumbo is left alone by the rude elephants, but a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse comes to Dumbo's rescue. With Timohy's help, Dumbo becomes known as the world's only flying elephant, thanks to his big ears. His other is set free, and everything goes back to normal - with one exception. Dumbo's mother gets her own private section in the train, along with Dumbo. Even the elephants who had been mean earlier changed, even after Dumbo sprayed a bunch of peanuts at them at the circus.Great movie. 7/10.My Score: 7/10."
27,Dumbo,10,11 April 2013,Pulchritudinous pachyderms!,"One of the shortest, the cheapest and simplest of Disney's animated films, Dumbo also happens to be one of the best. Stung by the fall-out from Fantasia, Disney returned to the story telling qualities that had made Pinocchio so successful. The simple story finds a baby elephant born with over sized ears who is separated from his mother when she's locked away for trying to protect him. Ostracised by his own kind and a figure of fun to the human public, Dumbo skulks away with his only friend, Timothy Q. Mouse. At the pinnacle of their adventure together, Dumbo discovers he has a talent, a talent that will change his life forever.And that's all there is to it. Only it's a picture that pulls on a myriad of emotions, it's funny, sad, exciting, and a great message movie as well. Delightful for the kids and ever watchable for adults of all ages, it's totally reliant on the animals for characterisations, where amazingly Dumbo is the one animal on show who doesn't speak! But it matters not, such is Disney when on top form, the animation is so great that just from Dumbo's expressions we know how he is feeling. Some wonderful tunes in here as well, including the quite beautiful ""Baby Mine"", while a surreal hallucination sequence (Pink Elephants On Parade) that plays out as Dumbo and Timothy accidentally drink liquor, is remarkable. There has been some balking at the black characterisations via some jaunty and funky crows, but they are immensely funny and for 1941 they be crafted with love and there's not a hint of being aware to racial stereotypes.Disney ""A"" League is Dumbo. 10/10"
28,Dumbo,9,23 October 2012,An animated classic,"When the storks come to the circus delivering baby animals Mrs Jumbo is upset as her expected package has not arrived. It arrives the next day as the circus animals are travelling on the train; the other elephants think the baby is cute... until they see its enormous ears; Jumbo Jnr. is promptly dubbed 'Dumbo'. Things soon get worse; the children visiting the circus torment Dumbo because of his ears leading to his mother losing her temper with the children and the circus staff; for this she is chained up and kept in a separate wagon. Dumbo understandably gets depressed and this is made worse as the other elephants blame him and his freakish ears. At this point Timothy Q. Mouse takes it upon himself to befriend Dumbo and help him become a valued part of the circus. At first things don't go according to plan but eventually after an encounter with some friendly crows he comes up with an idea that will make Dumbo the most famous elephant the world has ever known!At just over an hour in length this film is definitely rather short; that doesn't mean it shouldn't be considered a classic though; it just means the creators told the story in the required amount of time and didn't pad it out with unnecessary material. The story is quite delightful even if it is surprisingly bleak at times with its theme of bullying, the ostracism of the main character and the treatment of his mother; thankfully it is told in a way that shouldn't be upsetting and any sadness caused by those early scenes is more than made up for with the happy ending. The animation is delightful if a more cartoony than I was expecting; a particularly liked the expert use of shadows in many scenes. The characters were pretty good; especially Timothy, the catty elephants, the crows and Dumbo of course. There are some scenes that may surprise the modern viewer; one of the crows constantly smokes a cigar and a key scene involves Dumbo and Timothy accidentally getting drunk on champagne and hallucinating the famous 'Pink Elephants on Parade'.If you haven't seen this before and get a chance I heartily recommend you give it a go as it is the sort of film that can be enjoyed by anybody whatever their age; it would take a real cynic not to enjoy Dumbo's final triumph after the adversity he has been through."
29,Dumbo,6,24 October 2012,Dumbo,"The classic Dumbo is a short movie about a cute little elephant who has self-image issues because of his big ears. It's a good lesson for kids everywhere - take what other people see as something bad about you and turn it into something positive.There's lots of animals in the animated movie, and we are introduced to most of them at the beginning of the movie. Storks are seen delivering babies everywhere - keeping with the old time explanation of ""where do babies come from?"" Other animals seen are bears, kangaroos, fish, tigers, giraffes, elephants, birds, monkeys, foxes, ostriches, snakes, horses, camels, zebras, hippos, gorillas, and even a mouse.Objects are person-fied in this movie. such as the train that talks. Animals are more like people then animals. The cut mouse who gives Dumbo his confidence, Mrs. Jumbo and her annoyingly rude companions, Mr. Stork.Comedy is written in a way that is funny for the adults as well as the children. I love when the stork is sitting on the cloud (every child imagines sitting on a cloud) and looking down on the earth at a map of the United States. The stork is constantly having to retrieve Dumbo as he sinks through the cloud.My favorite song is ""When I See an Elephant Fly.""Some negative elements: there is alcohol in this movie. We can see men drinking it, then later water is tainted with alcohol and the mouse and Dumbo are drunk. They have a wild vision..."
30,Dumbo,9,13 October 2012,Very simple and nearly perfect.,"Years ago, I thought ""Dumbo"" was a bit of fluff--a simple film that Disney made between their 'better' films, ""Bambi"" and ""Pinocchio"". However, when I saw this film again many years later, I was extremely impressed and would place this among the best of Disney's films--even though it's not a perfect movie. While it is true that the animation style is a bit simpler than these two other films, ""Dumbo"" still is a nice looking film. Its use of bright primary colors works great and is perfect for a picture set at a circus. And, as far as the story goes, it's really, really hard not to love the characters and find yourself choked up as you watch the film. Seeing the portion where Dumbo's mother sings to him as she's locked away from his will touch ANYONE'S heart--no matter how jaded they are--it's just brilliantly written and executed. My only real reservation is that some will no doubt find the crows in the film a bit offensive. While they are NOT stupid or evil, they are clearly meant to be like black people--with exaggerated language and features. Still, considering the times, this is a relatively benign slight compared to what you often saw in films! Well worth seeing and a delight.By the way, this is NOT a complaint, but for anyone interested, the beginning is a bit strange, given that I live only a few miles from the old winter quarters for the circus, here in Sarasota, Florida. First, Sarasota is not THAT far south (like they show on the map)--that location would actually place the circus in the Everglades! Also, they show lots of huge hills/mountains, but I think the highest natural elevation in this part of Florida is about 9 inches! Obviously, the Disney folks back in 1941 had NOT spent much time in Florida."
31,Dumbo,,9 July 2003,brilliant Disney classic,Disney's flying elephant with the big ears.  Timothy Mouse and the peanuts. The pyramid of jumbos in the circus ring.  The roustabouts building the big top.  Elephants on parade.  The heartbreak of Mrs Jumbo.  Mr Stork and his stubborn packages up in the clouds.  The crows.The animation is perfect and so are the songs on the soundtrack.  Dumbo is an hour of perfection and one of Disney's best.
32,Dumbo,4,23 September 2014,A bit bland,"This Disney movie was below average for me. I know stuff like this happens to actual people around the world. Where the child is taken away from the mother and become slaves. So movies like this shines a bit of light on those issues. Even if it's by a tiny margin. Maybe I am being a bit harsh on this movie, but ""Bambi"" is just a way better movie than this. Sure, Dumbo is cute but there is plenty of other Disney characters that can be characterized as cute. When it comes to the plot, it's about a baby Elephant that figures out his talent in life to overcome the obstacles in his path. It would have been nice if it delved more into Dumbo finding his courage and stuff. But that isn't the case. Overall this is a below average Disney movie.4.5/10"
33,Dumbo,10,5 August 2005,Disney Keeps it Short and Sweet,"Clocking in at just 64 minutes, Dumbo is one of the shortest films out there, but it gets to the point.Dumbo is probably one of the best Disney films along with the most sad. However, it has a great message about how people react to things that they aren't used to. For the very few who don't know, Dumbo is a baby elephant with abnormally big ears and is treated badly because of it by everyone except his mother. It is heartbreaking when they are torn apart but Dumbo keeps strong and is finally reunited with her. It is a touching film that should not be missed.The songs are great too."
34,Dumbo,10,17 May 2014,Top notch Disney film.,"This animated classic really makes me nostalgic for the old days when hand drawn animation was the norm and not the exception. There is much that's utterly charming about this wholly appealing fable, with some extremely endearing heroes, a healthy amount of comedy, moments both sad and scary, wonderful ditties, and some of the most imaginative animation for a Disney film of the time. (The ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" sequence is stunning in its imagery.) And it sure does have a great message about self esteem and finding ones' way in the world.Mrs. Jumbo, an elephant in a circus, gets a delightful present from Mr. Stork: a little bundle of joy who just so happens to have oversized ears. Cruelly dubbed Dumbo by Mrs. Jumbos' ignorant fellow pachyderms, he is befriended by the engaging, upbeat Timothy Q. Mouse (voice of Edward Brophy), who does everything he can to make life more bearable for Dumbo. It isn't until after a night, when Dumbo accidentally imbibes, that he and Timothy discover the hidden talent that will make him a star.Guaranteed to stir the emotions of young and adult viewers alike, ""Dumbo"" is very short (an hour and four minutes all told) and sweet. Based on a book by Helen Aberson & Harold Pearl, it does pack a good story into those 64 minutes. In addition to the characters mentioned, the ones who deserve a mention are those amusing crows who start out mocking Dumbo like so many others here, but get their own heart strings tugged and end up helping him a great deal. Dumbo himself has no dialogue, and therefore his character is established with irresistible expressions and reactions. You also can't help but side with Mrs. Jumbo; that whole sequence where mother and son get together the only way that they can is beautiful.This is a lovely film that deserves to be discovered by each generation.10 out of 10."
35,Dumbo,,21 December 2012,One of Disney's Best,"Dumbo (1941) **** (out of 4)One of Disney's greatest and cutest films centers on the elephant Dumbo, a small elephant with incredibly large ears. The large ears cause him to be picked on by many but with the help of his only friend, a mouse, he starts to be praised for what he can do. DUMBO is without question one of the studios greatest films and I think I'd say that it's also their very cutest. I think the characters here are among some of the best ever done for the studio and the screenplay is quite simple but it milks ever bit of emotion it can from the viewer. The most noticeable thing about watching this film today is how mean everyone in it is towards Dumbo. I'm sure most parents will be turned off by the behavior and I'm sure kids will be able to connect with Dumbo. There's no question that there's a message to be learned here and it's hard to believe that anyone could see this movie and not feel bad if they're the person picking on someone or get courage if they're the person being picked on. The story itself is quite simple and predictable but the characters from the leads to the supporting elephants to the crows are just so memorable and perfectly written. The songs here aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Disney films of this era but they're still pretty good. The animation is also quite simple but I thought this approach added for some beautiful scenes. DUMBO is clearly a film that works on so many levels and it remains one of the best of its kind."
36,Dumbo,10,10 March 2009,Short and sweet!,"Dumbo for me is a mini- masterpiece, with beautiful animation, an inspiring message and the sweetest elephant on screen. Dumbo is an elephant born with big ears, but who cares? True beauty comes from within. Dumbo's mother was like Bambi's mother, wise and memorable, and like Dumbo, misunderstood. The song ""Baby of Mine"" is so sad, that I always cry when I see this film because of it, Casey Jnr is very rousing and having a good laugh during ""Seen an Elephant Fly"". In regard to the crows, I saw nothing racist about them, they are stereotypical yes in a sense but in a positive way. Timothy the mouse is also memorable, a bit like Dumbo's conscience in a sense. For me, the highlight was Dumbo's dream, with the elephants dancing(a bit unrealistic but very imaginative), with ballet-like incidental music towards the end. I found the song ""Elephants on Parade"" catchy and I love how trippy the whole sequence is. In conclusion, I rejoiced when Dumbo conquered his fears, when it looked impossible. Great idea, Disney, about the flying elephant, although Don Bluth used a similar idea 50 years later for Pebble and the Penguin. A beautiful film, 10/10 Bethany Cox"
37,Dumbo,10,13 July 2005,Dumbo,"I saw this many times as a kid, and is still one of my most favourite Walt Disney Pictures animated films. The film begins with Mrs. Jumbo the elephant wanting a baby delivered by a stalk. She gets one eventually, and his ears grow really big. Unfortunately when protecting Dumbo (the young elephant) she gets chained up for going mad at people picking on him. Dumbo is now alone, will new friend Timothy Mouse comes along and plans to make him famous with his big ears. The first attempt goes horribly wrong, and as a result Dumbo is turned into a clown. Dumbo and Timothy do get their fame in the end, after demonstrating to some crows, and then the circus audience, that his ears are big enough to make him fly, and he gets his mother back too. The sequences that are most memorable are the teary brief reuniting of Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo with the song ""Baby Mine"", and of course, my favourite, when Dumbo and Timothy get drunk, blow bubbles, and have the great hallucination of many pink elephants, the song and the sequence are just brilliantly imaginative. Dumbo is the only Disney character that never speaks, and I never realised, but this film is almost exactly one hour long (plus one minute), no wonder it is considered a bit of an underdog film. It won the Oscar for Best Original Music, and was nominated for Best Song for ""Baby Mine"", and it won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Animation Design. It was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 83 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!"
38,Dumbo,10,23 October 2016,"You're making history!""","So this early Disney movie has always been one of my top firm favourites of the studio, it's compact, to the point, and heartwarmingly sweet. It may be Disney's shortest feature, but it's possibly the biggest in pure heart, as the emotional appeal of it is positively through the roof! I always responded quite strongly to it, I think it's one of those magical works of animation that speaks to the inner goodness and child in all of us. At just over an hour it chugs along steadily and it feels like just the right amount of time to me, not too little nor too much. And animation-wise it is something of a downgrade from the pictures that preceded it and is less visually rich and distinctly more cartoony, but that was by design and out of necessity. I like the animation style, I think the more vivid colour scheme and more brighter open backgrounds add to the very distinctive circus atmosphere and visual style of the film that to me makes it a lot of fun. Nobody should ever make the mistake of thinking of this movie as 'lazy' filmmaking, because no mere half-hearted effort could ever have inspired such love over so many years. How it can make you so sad you want to cry during the masterful work of emotion that is the ""Baby Mine"" sequence which is one of the most beautiful and heart-wrenching moments in Disney movies ever, and then how warm and joyful the feeling is at the end when he flies into her embrace as Casey Jones the train moves off into the sunny distance is? That's great scripting, voicing, and characterisation at work, this clearly had a lot of love put into it. There's a reason amusement parks the world over have cute little whirly-gig rides that lift off the ground bearing Dumbo's image! The characterisation of him is truly exceptional. Despite never saying a word except for some adorable sneezes and squeals, Dumbo is a great character and you always know exactly what he's thinking as he reacts to everything with his big blue eyes. I think the reason he's such a beloved little character isn't only because he's so cute, but because of how much we care and root for him and want to see him pull through and be reunited with his loving mother. A lot of characters are very mean to him but it does make it count more when someone is nice to him, and it does make his eventual victory all the more triumphant as he flies high over all and becomes the biggest ever star of the big top. I also love Timothy the mouse who appoints himself as Dumbo's mentor and protector. He's such a great witty mouse, and he's nothing remotely like Mickey. Ed Brophy did a fantastic job. Note the possible reference to Nosferatu as Timothy approaches the sleeping ringmaster to subliminally give him his inspiration! Oh my, the crows. Well I like them, apart from Timothy they're the only ones in the story to be sympathetic to Dumbo's plight and it's because of them why Dumbo really learns how to fly. The moody animation sequence of the ""Roustabouts"" song is the best in the whole movie, dark and powerful and driving as everybody works together to gradually raise the tent, the quality of the animation is leagues above the rest of the picture during that one sombre song. So anyway the legendary Pink Elephants sequence remains such a blast to watch after so many years. I don't know quite what to make of it, except for finding it so awesomely random. You just don't know if it's meant to be funny, very odd or plain spooky! It's so crazily creative how all the elephants merge and break apart while keeping a great visual and thematic flow to the whole surreal exercise. It's like the animators couldn't keep their creativity in check and just had to sneak in their big bizarre musical number! I'm so glad they did, as it adds a lot of spice to the movie all by itself. Watch out for the weird elephant camel! Wonderful, a treasure and a classic in its own right. We love you Dumbo! X"
39,Dumbo,10,24 July 2013,Dumbo Blu-Review,"The 70th anniversary Blu-Ray of Dumbo is a must have for Disney fans and classic animation fans alike. The movie has been restored beautifully, showcasing the charming water-colored backgrounds, and the animation just pops off the screen in High-Def, like a living painting. Years ago when I seen a documentary about how Disney was using computers to clean up their classic animated films frame by frame I wasn't sure how the result would be, but the movie looks like it was just made, and not in a bad way. The sound is equally well restored, not over-blown but above and beyond most movies over 70 years old. A huge improvement over the DVD release from 2001.The movie if you are one of the few people on earth not familiar with the tale, is about a baby elephant with extremely large ears, named Jumbo Jr, but after being mocked the name ""Dumbo"" sticks. Despite this, with the help of his friend, a mouse, Timothy Q. Mouse, he soars above his bullies in more ways than one.Dumbo is presented in it's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and you can chose to watch it with black bars on the sides, or changing art panels that reflect each scene. There is also a Cine-Explore experience, with historians and animators taking you through the movie, a deleted scene and song, a documentary on the making of the film, a feturette called Celebrating Dumbo, and one on the ride at Disney Land, an audio commentary, a pair of classic Disney Shorts ""The Flying Mouse"" and ""Elmer Elephant"" (both in HD as are most the special features), and some games for the kids.

40,Dumbo,10,21 October 2012,Amazing story,I don't understand why people have been giving this lower points due to it not being for kids....ALL Disney films are supposed to be FOR ALL AGES not just kids so it shouldn't have lost points for that!It's an amazing heartwarming story. It's very sad because of the bullying but I think it's great for people to see so everyone can be aware that these things happen and just how much it affects the person suffering from it...it's a classic story about discrimination just for being different. I think it's good to be aware of these types of goings on. It's visually stunning (typically for a Disney movie) I also love the sub story of the mouse and his friendship with Dumbo..and the crows! Really lovely film..well written. Everything is perfect...nice positive happy ending too! I really love this movie! Can't fault it!
41,Dumbo,10,10 March 2012,A simple and beautiful message about tolerance and self-achievement for all the Dumbos in the world ... which means everybody ...,"""Dumbo"" is one of the most popular Disney films; yet it strikes by the simplicity of its story and design. Made to recoup the big budget of ""Fantasia"", it's only fitting that Disney, by making its first and only original story, created the most representative illustration of the Disney spirit through the adorable little circus elephant.Indeed, on the surface, ""Dumbo"" is the Disney film with the most cartoonish feel, it is inferior to ""Snow White"" as far as animation is concerned and had nothing to be compared to ""Fantasia"", as for the animals' design, they can't even be seen as a draft for the next masterpiece ""Bambi"". Still, ""Dumbo"" has something that elevates it above all these considerations, an emotionality that raises it above all the other Disney films and that still inspire many people afflicted with a social handicap in the world. Through the figure of a little elephant who can't speak, ""Dumbo"" speaks the most universal truths about acceptance, tolerance and the capability to accept the others' flaws, its message is universal, and its charm is unique. I feel guilty to put ""Dumbo"" above ""Bambi"" because I've always considered the second as Disney's ultimate masterpiece, and many would argue that ""Pinocchio"" has the same message than ""Dumbo"" but with a better drawing, but the force of ""Dumbo"" lies in the pure and blue eyes of the little elephant and the characteristics that make him the most endearing of all Disney characters. Bambi is great but as I mentioned in a previous review, the film is more about the passing of time and the little fawn is only an element of an eternal circle of life. ""Dumbo"" is about a character, the cutest thing that ever been drawn, the pride of his mother, Mrs Jumbo, that an unfortunate sneezing would makes his ears enormous. And in one second, Jumbo Jr. Is renamed Dumbo by the mean-spirited gossipy female elephants of the circus troop, in one frame; Walt Disney created the character that would embody the sort of benign handicap that would crystallize all the mockery and cruelty of the world.My ears are not big, they're even smaller than average but I know many kids who were given the terrible nickname of 'Dumbo', or other meaner ones. I remember my younger brother having issues with his ears and I couldn't understand why one would make such a big deal, but this is what childhood is about, either we learn to accept our flaws and the others' flaws, either we learn how to point our fingers on what is wrong with the other and take pleasure from that. Walt Disney, contrarily to what his current reputation make people believe, never sugar-coated the reality or depicted a cute world with talking animals and sappy songs, all his films had an intelligence, a message for kids and adults, and kids were not necessarily depicted in their advantage. Take ""Pinocchio"" and the Island sequence, in ""Dumbo"", the adults are the bullies, and ""Dumbo"" represents the poor little infant incapable to perceive hostility and trying to do his best to please everyone.This is where I identified with ""Dumbo"", as a child, I was awfully shy, to a point I never spoke in class, why? Because I was easily impressed and couldn't deal with more than one person, it's over since the age of six but I remember how hard it was, to face the ugly comments of some adults who asked if I was deaf, dumb or something. The name Dumbo represents the constant mix-up between silence and dumbness, the fact that someone who doesn't talk back, who doesn't express his anger is either weak or dumb, and that there's no place in this cynical world for good hearts. ""Dumbo"" takes all the hostility and his mother replies to the rest of the world. In a heart-breaking scene, she defends her son bullied by the kind of kid that would have deserved the Lampwick-treatment. Therefore she's immediately locked up in a cage as a mad elephant. The film works as a wonderful tribute to the purity and indivisibility of a mother's love, incarnated by the song ""Baby's Mine"" that echoes the beginning where the storks send all the kids to their mothers.""Dumbo"" carries a powerful message about love as the only true sacred element in life, love and friendship, incarnated by the protective figure Timothy the Mouse, Dumbo's only friend, funnier and less patronizing than Jiminy Cricket. Still, Disney doesn't send the wrong message that even if you have a handicap, you'll still have people who love you and help you. Dumbo is not a passive character and his journey with Timothy will end up by learning how to overcome his weaknesses not by denying it or getting rid of it but by translating into a force. The ears would turning into wings mirrors the eternal theme of the metamorphosis, the ugly chrysalis that turn into a magnificent butterfly, the ugly duckling who becomes a beautiful swan. ""Dumbo"" teaches us in his language that what doesn't kill us -and being different never killed anyone- makes us stronger, if we find the strength to get over it. The message of ""Dumbo"" justifies its place in the American Film's Institute Top 100 Cheers, along with ""Pinocchio"" as both shows children who achieved things by themselves.But in all honesty, the film wouldn't be half the classic it is, if it didn't provide us the unforgettably nightmarish ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" sequence. I would never forget the haunting sights of these Technicolor pachyderms with absent eyes and how I used to cover my eyes when came the elephant made of elephants' heads but as a grown-up, I see this part as one of the greatest Disney moments ever, with the all-seeing eye that almost winks at the adults we became with still a little of Dumbo, inside our hearts."
42,Dumbo,9,4 May 2007,Disney at the height of his powers!,"Dumbo proves that Walt Disney back in the early 40's was truly on the top of his powers. The story of Dumbo is quite a sad one but turns right in the end! Dumbo has enormously large ears that is sadly teased by his fellow older elephants and the circus folk but all expect his mother Mrs. Jumbo who loves him just the way he is. Sadly, she is locked away whilst protecting her son from heartless audiences to the circus. Dumbo is alone until he meets Timothy Mouse, a small but spirited mouse with the will to get Dumbo flying with his ears like a bird. In the end thought he is reunited with his mother. This certainly isn't as sad as Bambi but still powerful enough to turn you to tears. This is a fab movie which should never be mess with as you see so many of Walt's other masterpieces getting destroyed by sequels! 9/10"
43,Dumbo,9,7 April 2007,"A cute, funny and heartwarming Disney classic.","With its impossibly cute title character, positive underlying messages (it's okay to be different, believe in yourself), a handful of memorable songs, and some wonderful animation, Dumbo is classic Disney fun from start to finish.When Mrs. Jumbo's new baby is delivered by the stork, she is delighted, despite the fact that his ears are a tad larger than normal. The other elephants mock the little pachyderm, nicknaming him Dumbo, and make his life a misery. However, with the help of a mouse named Timothy, and a gang of crows, Dumbo discovers he has an unusual talent: he can fly.This heartwarming tale is told brilliantly by Walt's talented animators, and is guaranteed to put a smile on your face, whatever your age. The story, despite being only 64 minutes long, crams in an awful lot: comedy, tragedy, spectacle, and even a rather trippy Fantasia-style segment about pink elephants.If I had to find a fault with Dumbo, it would be in its pacing: the film starts rather slowly and then feels quite rushed at the end, with the flying elephant's eventual fame and success relayed via a rather nippy montage of newspaper headings. But other than that, the film is pretty much perfect."
44,Dumbo,10,20 August 2017,Emotional and encouraging,"It is a short movie, but it does not matter, it makes every minute a wonderful experience in this tale of acceptance and love for our individual strengths.I have very fond memories with Dumbo, because he really is one of the cutest things ever. And the fact that he is mute makes way for some brilliant facial expressions. Dumbo has the emotional scene in the Disney catalog which gets me every time. People who have seen this know what I am talking about. But that is not all. Not only tearjerker scenes happen in the short time span of Dumbo, it also has a pretty scary visual experience. Go watch it! You won't regret it. All kinds of emotions fully used in such a short time."
45,Dumbo,7,5 June 2016,"Sweef, Simple Family Fun,","Dumbo is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. It is a very sweet, fun film for the whole family to enjoy, just running over an hour, it's quick and very easy to follow, but you will also find yourself very connected to these characters, the adorable elephant, the witty mouse, the charismatic crows, it's a great ride. However, the plot is slim, there is little story, we mainly follow Dumbo as he learns how to fly, but nothing really happens, in comparison to Disney's two films prior to this, Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, development is thin. The film certainly should have focused on Dumbo's relationship with his mother, it was the only part that had any real depth or emotion, and I think it could have been very effective had it been scoped more. It's certainly not flawless, but Dumbo is a fun hour for the whole family, some unforgettable work by Disney. A elephant who is ridiculed for his huge ears soon gains the ability to fly with them, making him a popular circus act. Best Performance: Edward Brophy"
46,Dumbo,9,13 October 2015,"This story showcases the hardships one can have growing up as Dumbo faces bullying, judgment, being cast out, and without the support of family.","Dumbo is a wonderful children's movie which may seem old, but casts a beautiful spell over you where you can feel free to be a child over again. This story showcases the hardships one can have growing up as Dumbo faces bullying, judgment, being cast out, and without the support of family. In this tale, Dumbo learns to overcome all of these problems and spreads his wings as he leaves all of these problems behind. While Dumbo's story has its ups and downs, it is sure to make you laugh and cry as this awkward little elephant finds his way through life. Dumbo starts off as a happy elephant baby with his mother's support and protective love. Of course, life isn't always perfect and is filled with ups and downs. Without his mother's support, Dumbo becomes lost without the familiar touch he always had. Alone, Dumbo discovers that even when life becomes hard, it does not mean he should give up. Instead, Dumbo, with the help from others, learns how to overcome the bullying and judgment place upon him and instead, with a little magic, learns that he can not let those opinions to weigh him down to the ground."
47,Dumbo,8,7 April 2015,The little movie which made a profit,"This is an animated feature produced by Walt Disney Productions. There will be spoilers ahead:Dumbo was made relatively quickly, for a much smaller budget than the previous films Disney did, in order to help Disney make a profit. World War II had eliminated much of Disney's overseas market, which reduced revenues drastically. The film is short and much more simple in design.The basic story is that of Dumbo, a baby elephant delivered by a stork to a circus train. Dumbo becomes obviously ""different"" after sneezing and causing his ears to expand. He's teased and bullied as a result, his mother comes to his defense, with the result that she's deemed ""mad"" and chained up in isolation.A mouse named Timothy decides he's going to help Dumbo. His ""help"" gets Dumbo a spot in a pyramid act with the other elephants which ends in disaster and gets Dumbo banished to the clown act and his being shunned even more by the elephants. Timothy arranges for Dumbo to see his mother and then Timothy and Dumbo get drunk, leading to the best animation of the film, the ""Pink Elephants On Parade"" sequence.When Timothy comes to the next day to find them both in a tree, he figures out Dumbo can fly using his ears. Enter the crows, who help Dumbo to appreciate himself. Timothy convinces Dumbo he has a ""magic feather"" and that he can fly. Dumbo ultimately wins out, getting even with his tormentors, getting his mom free and becoming a star of the circus.Dumbo is available on DVD and Blu Ray and is very much worth seeing. Recommended."
48,Dumbo,8,23 October 2014,A Warmhearted Film,"Dumbo is a good Walt Disney animated film classic that has a deeper story to tell than what is on the surface. To say that Dumbo ""is about an elephant with big ears in a circus"" is only the start of what Dumbo is about.A closer look at Dumbo - it's about having physical abnormalities and over coming the fear of others shunning or making fun of you because of it - the movie shows you can still 'shine' no matter what you look like. In this respect, Dumbo is similar to the films ""The Elephant Man"" or ""Roxanne"".The saddest scene in the film, to me, was when Dumbo was ripped away from his mother Mrs. Jumbo. The most touching part of the film. Dumbo was very lucky to find a good friend: Timothy Q. Mouse. Dumbo and Timothy will steal the circus show! 8.5/10"
49,Dumbo,7,8 December 2013,Circus Elephant,"Dumbo is a baby elephant which had been delivered by stork to Mrs. Jumbo, veteran circus elephant. Only thing is, poor Dumbo has big floppy ears, which are the object of ridicule by some cruel children visiting the circus, prompting Mrs. Jumbo to defend him by charging at them, which unfortunately leads to her being chained, and leaving Dumbo on his own as a circus clown, though Timothy Q. Mouse takes pity on him, leading him to help Dumbo use his big ears to his advantage, eventually using them as wings to fly... Warm fable with nice Disney animation and story, and a good message of keeping faith in oneself, and turn a negative into a positive."
50,Dumbo,8,11 October 2013,Lovable Story on the short side.,"This fourth full-length feature film from Walt Disney is one of the most memorable and lovable stories from Disney, about a little elephant named Dumbo with big ears. Shunned by the other elephants, he is forced to be a castaway until he is befriended by a little mouse and enters the circus with his new trait - ears that can make him fly.There are some depressing moments in this movie, especially the scene where Dumbo's mother is in confinement. You won't see any magic or tricks in this one like you would normally see in a fairytale and I think the music is not as remarkable as in other Disney films. Though the animation is colorful, characters are lovable and the story is pretty compelling, this movie overall is little on the short side, with just over one hour in length, and I think it lacks the majesty you would see in many of Disney's classics. However, it's still a good fun movie showcasing courage, friendship and a mother's love. The climax is my favorite. It's great for the kids.Grade B"
51,Dumbo,8,5 February 2013,"Disney's most basic early film, but no less memorable and emotional","Mere months before the U.S. entered World War II, Disney released its fourth major animated film, ""Dumbo."" At an unusually short 63 minutes, ""Dumbo"" tells a simple story of an elephant separated from his mother and picked on for his over-sized ears, who with the help of a circus mouse, must learn to love and believe in himself.""Dumbo"" is really a short film padded by artistic sequences set to moving, Oscar-winning music. It opens with storks delivering babies to all the animals involved in a traveling circus. The kangaroo gets her baby, the tiger gets her babies and even the hippo gets her baby, but poor Mrs. Jumbo the elephant is left empty-handed. This sets the tone for the alienation both she and her soon-to-arrive child, Jumbo Jr., will experience throughout the film.When Mr. Stork (Sterling Holloway) eventually delivers Jumbo Jr., he and his mother become a laughing stock when the other lady elephants see his gigantic ears, nicknaming him ""Dumbo."" At one point at a circus stop, several spectators tease Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo goes mad with rage. The Ringmaster (Herman Bing) has her chained up in a train car and Dumbo is left to fend for himself  until he's befriended by Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy). Timothy thinks Dumbo's ears suit him well and believes he could be a star. He becomes Dumbo's life coach and only companion.The tender relationship between Dumbo and his mother (which would become a major dynamic in Disney's next film, ""Bambi"") is the emotional core of the film. Neither character speaks, and so the animators must focus on telling that story through the animation. At one point, a deflated Dumbo reunites with his confined mother and she cradles him in her trunk through the barred windows of the train car as the song ""Baby Mine"" plays, a timeless lullaby. Even Timothy sheds a tear. It's the most powerful scene in the film and testament to Disney's legacy.""Dumbo"" has lots of unforgettable sequences peppered throughout that accompany the extremely basic narrative arc of how wide-eyed Dumbo gets separated from mom, feels shame and embarrassment for who he is and then accepts and believes in himself. Not all of them make sense and many are of questionable appropriateness, but they give ""Dumbo"" it's unique stamp among the Disney classics.""Song of the Roustabouts,"" for example, is a terrifying sequence in which the elephants, along with several African-American laborers, pitch the Big Top tent in the middle of a booming thunderstorm. The way light flashes and the wind whips water all about creates a fascinating mood, but the juxtaposition of circus animal labor and the presumed labor of free but unequal blacks makes it a strange scene to wedge into the beginning of the movie.""Pink Elephants on Parade"" later in the movie is a visually daring and impressive sequence, but it's wildly inappropriate and arguably unnecessary. After Dumbo is made the butt of a joke in the clown act at the circus that proves successful, the clowns celebrate in their tent. Their liquor spikes the water bucket Dumbo and Timothy drink from and suddenly our main characters are having drunken hallucinations of color-changing elephants in a sequence clearly borrowing from the spirit of ""Fantasia,"" which came out the year before. They wake up the next morning hanging from a tree, which leads Timothy to suppose Dumbo flew them up there in their drunken stupor. So, essentially, an accidental drunken episode leads to Dumbo's discovery of his amazing talent.At that point we meet the black crows, several jive-talking caricatures of African-Americans led by a character named Jim Crow (Cliff Edwards). Even if you assume the best of intentions on Disney's end, there's still a lot of insensitivity to be accounted for. At the same time, while they mock Dumbo at first, they apologize and are among few characters to be nice to him.Over time, these regrettable choices have given ""Dumbo"" its own unique flavor and helped it become a classic that stands on its own merits in Disney's canon, not a film that has simply been bolstered by the films made before and after it. Coming off ""Fantasia"" and ""Pinocchio,"" ""Dumbo"" delivered the same emotional punch with less at its disposal in terms of story and visual detail. It's over in a flash, but ""Dumbo"" stands out with more than big ears.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com"
52,Dumbo,8,23 October 2011,"A film that made me cry as a kid, proves it's okay to be different and one can even fly!","""Dumbo"" is one of those Disney classics that I will never forget it's a film that stayed with me from childhood. It's story is a tale of emotion and it's touching seeing that it's okay to be different, and that despite being different one can fly high and be loved just like Dumbo! I mostly remember this film as a kid because I cried when Dumbo's mother was taken away from him at the circus and locked up! Being little that just tore my heart out! Still after watching this classic many years later you see it's a film that's a joy due to it's spirit of being different and touching is the emotions and love that Dumbo feels from a mother's love to a friendship with a little mouse it's all feel good enjoyable entertainment. This tale is just so heartfelt Dumbo the little baby who's different with those big over-sized cute and lovable ears soars to fame with the help of circus mouse Timothy Q. And this classic is guided along just wonderful from the animation music this classic always has me flying high with joy and remembered love."
53,Dumbo,7,15 November 2010,"a minor classic, but still engaging","It may be only a minor classic, but this family favorite from the Golden Age of Disney animation was made with the understanding that adults could be just as charmed as their children by the adventures of a baby circus elephant. Kids, of course, might empathize more with poor Dumbo's plight: born with the stigma of oversize ears; laughed at and picked upon by every animal in the circus; separated from his mother; and finally consigned to that limbo of lost circus souls  the clown act. But only adults will fully appreciate the bitchiness of Dumbo's elephant peers or the benevolent cockiness of Timothy Mouse, or the hep-cat lingo of the crows who can't figure out how an elephant came to be sleeping in the topmost branches of their tree. Baby Dumbo never utters a single word throughout the film (communicating entirely through his expressive eyes and ears), and his infant muteness keeps the expected sentimentality from becoming too sticky."
54,Dumbo,8,31 December 2007,Sweet to the Core,"Dumbo is a Disney classic in every respect! What instantly hits viewers is the sweetness of the story. It draws viewers back to a time when they thought the stork brought babies, and the excitement of a traveling circus, and the thrill of watching an elephant fulfill his dreams. Dumbo and his mother are wonderfully drawn characters, well-spoken even without speech, and they perfectly showcase the loving bond between mother and child, which has brought even stone-hearted adults to tears in ""Baby Mine"". The music has an enjoyable lift, if not memorable. Even ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" will be enjoyed for its creativity."
55,Dumbo,,24 August 2006,Another Masterpiece from Walt Disney,"""Dumbo"" was made at a horrible time for the Disney studios. World War II broke out, the ambitious and expensive ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"" failed at the box office. Disney toned down the ambitions planned for ""Bambi"". In the mean time, Disney quickly put ""Dumbo"" into production, a relatively cheap film that would help the Disney studios get some revenue.Despite the budget and schedule, Walt Disney knew that story and character came first, and that's exactly what ""Dumbo"" shows. At a short 64-minute runtime, ""Dumbo"" accomplishes a lot. The animators bring a lot of appeal into the title character and every other character. The villain in ""Dumbo"" is society, and how it treats an outsider like Dumbo himself. The story is about Dumbo overcoming this and becoming a success.The animation in ""Dumbo"" is more like a Silly Symphony, rather than the likes of ""Pinocchio"" and ""Fantasia"". For its small budget, it looks great and the movements are great. The backgrounds may not super-detailed, but they look great none-the-less. The character animation fires on all cylinders. The music is good as well. The film has the same emotional content as the previous Disney films, and the film makes you feel bad for the outcast elephant, successfully.Unfortunately, it tends to be looked at as inferior. The film is not advertised properly anymore (like any Disney film) and it comes off as something children's-like, when it is really one of Disney's darkest and borderline-depressing films (Depends on who you are). ""Dumbo"" may be one of Disney's saddest films (along with ""Bambi""), but there are moments of joy throughout. There are funny bits that are more cartoon-like in a slapstick way. There's some funny business where Dumbo and Timothy get drunk on a barrel of wine, which leads up to the magnificent ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" sequence.If you were to take that scene and release that as its own short, it would a masterpiece on its own. It's like it shifts into a completely different film. This scene predates most psychedelic and surreal animation, which leads younger people to assume that the animators were on acid. Truth be told, they were not, they were using their imaginations and being very creative. It's not that hard. It was produced a good 25 years before the psychedelic era anyway.A 10 out of 10. Like all the Golden Age Walt Disney films, this film succeeds on all fronts and will be a gem in the Disney canon for generations to come."
56,Dumbo,8,9 March 2006,What a lovely film,"The start of World War 2 hit at the same time the film was released.A shame for that.To this day this film remains lovely.Not long & it did not need to be any longer.Dumbo, of course, is so cute.And, got his points across without saying a word. An example of a great animated film character.I enjoyed Timothy as well. A ""sneaky"" character but is actually good.You know sooner or later Disney will release a special edition of this on DVD. Needs more extras for it.You support Mrs Jumbo in her protection of Dumbo.And, in other words, the good guys, I mean elephants, won in the end."
57,Dumbo,7,30 January 2002,it's still a classic,I just bought a DVD player today and Dumbo is the first disc I bought for it. I'm blown away by the quality of the picture and sound. I've seen the film on tv several times in the past years but it's sooo much better on DVD!The movie is now almost 61 years old but it's still one of Disney's best classics in the line of Bambi and the 101 dalmations.
58,Dumbo,8,1 September 2004,One of the first sappy Disney movies,"I can't help but cry to ""Dumbo"". It's such a sad story. Yes, I know it's a happy ending. But I just feel so badly for Dumbo. OK, it's a movie.
SPOILERS!Dumbo is a circus elephant with his mom. He accidentally falls off of the circus train and has to get back to the circus. He goes through a crazy adventure to get back. Him and his big ears make a lot of friends on the way.""Dumbo"" is a cute Disney movie. I would recommend it for any Disney fan.8/10"
59,Dumbo,6,20 December 1999,Too earnest. Where's the fun?,"""Dumbo"" is certainly an extremely sweet (and never sappy) animated feature, and the title character is one of the most endearing animated creatures I've ever seen. But the picture as a whole doesn't hold up too well; it just seems too slight to sustain even its 62 minutes, and today's kids will probably find the pacing uncomfortably sluggish. The film definitely has its moving moments, but it's not as entertaining as it should be. It's too earnest for a cartoon feature. Although the (extremely weird) dream sequence is the most widely praised, my favorite part has always been the delirious clown sequence: two hugely enjoyable minutes, with hilarious surrealistic jokes and perfect comic timing. It's a pity that the rest of the movie can't match the inventiveness of those two minutes."
60,Dumbo,10,14 June 2005,A new  view on Dumbo- a tool for inclusion and social skills,"I saw Dumbo as a child, and like,I think all kids, identified with Dumbo....as who does not feel left out at times? Dumbo is only marginally different from the other elephants, yet is ostracized by them.Today I am the mother of a disabled child, and I see the movie through the eyes of Mrs. Jumbo (Dumbo's mother). I cried deeply at her pain and at her helplessness to protect her child from those in society who belittle those who are different. This movie is the perfect example of the ""special needs"" child, and societies reaction to them . It could be easily used in the classroom, or by parents, to spark discussions on how to treat others. Anyone upset with the 'fantasia"" scene (where Dumbo and his friend get drunk by mistake), can leave it out. It is not an integral part of the story, but is indeed a work of art.Some crows help Dumbo, and apparently some see them as a stereotype on afro Americans. Frankly, both as a child and as an adult, I didn't realize the connotations...(if any are there); I just noted the Southern accent. The crows scene is more problematic to leave out, as it is really an integral part of the story. And if one minority group helps another discover that self-belief is a powerful tool, I don't see it as being bad, frankly. The crows are not negative, in my opinion. A teacher worried about this can discuss the first part of the movie without the ending. After all, as well as our children with special needs do today, very few will realistically reach the success of a Dumbo. So society still will need to accept those who do not overcome their disabilities ."
61,Dumbo,9,17 January 2015,Short and Sweet,"Dumbo was Disney Animation Studios 4th film after Snow White, Pinocchio, and Fantasia. It was made on a relatively low budget, in a short amount of time (probably because of World War II which is noticeable in the film in almost a propaganda-like way in the end of the film). The quality of animation is definitely not Disney's best (with many of the backgrounds being rough shapes, circus workers without faces, using shadows to portray people in tents, simply drawn line characters), but this proves to be unimportant. The story is simple, entertaining, and incredibly emotional.The film is about a precious infant elephant who is made fun of for his big ears which is where he receives his nickname Dumbo. He is part of a circus troupe with his mother who is taken from him after protecting him from mockers. He meets a friend Timothy, a circus mouse, who feels sorry for him and attempts to help the kid feel better and overcome his hardships. The middle of the film takes a bizarre twist with its dream sequence where baby Dumbo and Timothy go on an accidental alcohol fueled psychedelic trip. As weird as it is, the scene is very entertaining as well as innovative and imaginative probably something that had never been seen at the time. After this, Dumbo learns that his oversized ears are useful in that he can use them as wings to fly. With his incredible new skill he flies to great heights, becomes a star, and is reunited with his mother.Dumbo in his silence and cuteness, pulls at the sentiments of the audience along with his faithful little (yet big-hearted) friend Timothy Q. Mouse. It teaches important lessons of love, friendship, self-importance and sticking up for others. With a run-time of only 64 minutes this film is short and as sweet as can be."
62,Dumbo,,19 August 2014,"""I been done seen about everything when I see an elephant fly.""","Wonderful movie from the peak Disney years where they were at their creative best, in my opinion. My personal sentimental favorite. Beautifully animated with gorgeous colors. The ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" sequence is a psychedelic classic. The songs are timeless and perfect. Love the voice work, as well. All of the characters have great personality and care is taken with even small supporting parts to make them stand out. Dumbo himself is about as cute as it gets. The movie grabs you by the heart right away and never lets go. Some may not like the short runtime but I think it helps. Less is more sometimes. I just adore this movie and have since I was a kid, which is longer ago than I care to think about. I don't know if kids today are capable of enjoying old-fashioned classics such as this but I really hope they are."
63,Dumbo,10,26 May 2014,"One of Disney's most simplistic, but finest works to date","Made to recoup on the financial losses caused by the commercially unsuccessful Pinocchio and Fantasia (both 1940), Dumbo is one of Disney's shortest and narratively simplistic works to date. Ironically, it's also one of their finest. With Disney's 'nine old men' working on other projects to hopefully re-vamp the studios financial prospects, Dumbo was developed by Dick Huemer and Joe Grant, two of Disney's founding fathers, who took an unconventional approach to adapting the story from Helen Aberson's children's story. Written almost like a book, the film's charm and appeal lies in it's no frills approach.There's no heavy-handed morality message, just a simple tale about a cute elephant with a physical affliction trying to get by in a world that will not accept him. In fact, away from Jumbo Jr., cruelly dubbed 'Dumbo' by some unsavoury elephants, and his only friend in the world Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy), Dumbo's world is full of unkindness. The faceless men who run the travelling circus Dumbo is apart of, do little but hammer and build with a depressing resignation. The other elephants, apart from Mrs. Jumbo (Verna Felton), refuse to accept him due to his comically large ears, and do everything to ridicule and exile him. There's no moment of realisation for these characters, just a satisfying pay-back.It's strange that this is rarely mentioned as one of Disney's finest. Perhaps it's the lack of musical numbers or the use of silent-era slapstick and facial humour as opposed to the usual quipping sidekick. But for me, this enhances the enjoyment, putting more focus on the wonderful animation, and reducing the story down to something we can all relate to. Much has been said about the crows encountered by Dumbo towards the end of the film, and their racial stereotyping. I will not deny that some of Disney's early output do leave a nasty taste in the mouth, but, in fact, the crows are part of a select few who are sympathetic to Dumbo's plight, and Dumbo feels too innocent to be accused of such. And it's in this innocence that lies the magic, something that was lost once Disney came out of it's Golden Era.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
64,Dumbo,8,16 February 2014,Beautiful in its simplicity,"Though it is the least ambitious and groundbreaking of the first five Disney films, Dumbo (1941) is nevertheless as much a masterpiece as the rest of them, for in its simplicity lies its greatness.There are no big Broadway numbers, no breathtaking backgrounds or animation, but it is within Dumbo's characters and story that its universal appeal lies. Who hasn't ever felt like the titular elephant, lonely and outcast? How many of us haven't realized we need no magic feather to unlock the potential within ourselves, so as long as we have confidence and faith? It's a beautiful theme.The only drawback to Dumbo are the infamous crows. Though they are certainly not the worst racial stereotypes of the era and even a touch progressive in that they help Dumbo out, they are still stereotypes and if people are offended, then I cannot blame them for it.Over seven decades have passed since this film was first released. That Dumbo is still remembered and revered is a testament to its classic status."
65,Dumbo,9,13 June 2013,Dumbo forever!,"Dumbo is among the original Disney masterpieces, and masterpiece it is! My review is probably not necessary because most people have seen it by now, but I feel the need to include it because it is one of my favorite Disney Originals. Dumbo has the lovable circus characters, a funny little mouse and who can ever forget the Pink Elephants On Parade scene? I think Disney nailed this one by not making Dumbo a talking character because it makes his emotions on his face and in his actions all the more powerful. There is classic, circus-based soundtracks that add to the excitement, and of course the famous Baby Mine scene that was good enough to have been covered by many celebrities including Bette Midler. Classic family fun!"
66,Dumbo,7,26 May 2013,Let's talk about the elephant in the movie room here.,"Hands down, Dumbo will always be a Disney animation classic. The plot is rather simple, it's your basic Rudolph the Reindeer type of a story of a child who is a different to the point that makes them outcast amongst society. They get laugh at, discrimination, or mistreated. In this case, it's Dumbo's ears. It's a simple story of overcoming a difference that life threw at you and finding out how you can adapt to it. This may be a simple story but for me, it works for me and really, it's the characters that help to sell the story. Based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson, the story is about Jumbo JR who is cruelly mock to the point, that he was 'nickname' Dumbo. I love all his expressions are expressed through body language seeing as he doesn't talk but that comes from the fact that he's just a baby but even still, it works in the film and even without the dialogue, it is easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions. His only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy (Edward Brophy). While the elephants don't like the mouse, Dumbo finds a paternal figure in him while his mother is locked up trying to protect him. While the movie loves to point out that this is a flying Elephant movie, in truth, Dumbo only flies in the last 10 minutes of the film. This is where the plot device comes into play. On his journey of self-discovery, Dumbo meets a group of Crows that teach Dumbo how to fly using a Magic Feather. It wasn't magic, as it was meant to give him a boost in courage. Now there has been a bunch of controversial about the black crows. In my opinion, I don't find it racist. The racism accusations around the crows usually centers somewhat around the fact that the leader crow is named, ""Jim."" It's making a joke out of the Jim Crow laws. The crow leader is the only white actor playing a crow. It's Cliff Edwards (the voice of Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio). I do like James Baskett as one of the crows. He will play Uncle Remus in Song of the South later on his career adding more to the controversial. Now as far as the crow debate goes, I never had any problems with them at all since in turn, they were integral to Dumbo's growth in the end. They were cool then and still are cool now. I guess I can see how they could be considered a bit racially insensitive, but even then it was portraying non-negative stereotypes, not negative ones. It wasn't like they were picking at watermelon slices, eating fried chicken or anything. Yes, the crows were portrayed akin to a very popular racial stereotype, ""the Sambo."" The Sambo is portrayed as a lazy, ignorant and enthusiastic bum. Like other racial stereotypes, such as The Mammy, the Tom and so on, they were popularized portrayals used in racist minstrel shows. The decision to name the lead crow Jim, in tandem with portraying the crows as Sambo stereotypes, makes the Crows more of an insult aimed at the civil rights movement and their efforts than innocent, plucky birds. The fact that Disney managed to disguise this racism in the form of innocent, plucky birds and marketed it makes it kind of insidious. Still, this band of crows that are cool, funny, clever and snarky. True, they start out a little cold hearted, but ultimately show to be very upright people underneath once they learn of Dumbo's plight and help him accomplish the impossible. In fact, taken in context, they're the only morally decent characters besides Mrs. Jumbo and Timothy. All the other ""white"" characters are portrayed as haughty, selfish, big headed, mean, ignorant, and hurtful. The gossipy elephants, the cruel circus children, the pompous ring leader, and the horrible clowns all in some way hurt or endanger Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo for self-gain. Plus, ""When I See a Elephant Fly"" is one of the cleverest, funniest, and catchiest songs in a Disney movie. The other good song was ""Baby Mine"", I have no regrets in admitting that every time the song comes on, I always cry. Despite what I may feel or whatever goes on with the family, it brings back to joy and comfort that I cry in a good way for loving my family. The only reason Dumbo's mother is in there in the first place is because she was trying to protect him, he can't really see her and they can't touch much. Add that to the song itself, then the fact that they show all the other baby animals in the circus asleep with their mother's. So yeah, Disney really know how to make a tearjerker when they want to. The other songs are pointless. The Pink Elephants on Parade scene scared the living crap out of me when I was a kid, and wasn't needed. Look Out for Mr. Stork is a catchy barber song. Still, dated and was a bit odd. If you're on birth control he won't find you. It's time for lemonade and cracker jacks Casey junior's back was bad. The animation was simplicity due to an animators strike. It was a deliberate pursuit due to that, as Pinoccohio and Fantasia were both flops at the time due to the work detail need for those films. If Dumbo wasn't a success, Disney would have closed down its studios since they lost a lot of money on those films. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. The animators wouldn't have return until the following year with Bambi. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns. Overall: Dumbo is emotional, atmosphere works fast paced, energetic and fun."
67,Dumbo,10,24 March 2012,Classic Disney Film,"Dumbo is a classic Disney film that was made to help make up for losses that Fantasia suffered prior. It is one of the shorter Disney films at just about an hour long, but it is definitely one of the best Disney movies ever.Dumbo is an elephant who has exceptionally large ears. He is separated from his mother when she defends him from people who were making fun of him at the circus. The other elephants cast him out and don't regard him as an elephant and he is made a clown. However a mouse befriends him and helps him to start to make his life better.Dumbo is a great protagonist for the film. He is a character that you can root for due to him being a little different just because his ears are a little big. Also he is definitely the cutest Disney animal character out there so you want to see him succeed.Also the supporting character Timothy Mouse is great. He is instantly likable when he befriends Dumbo and wants to help him. Great character.This is one of the shortest Disney films. But I think that it is paced well and it is a good easy watch. Its short, but it hits on all the important levels, with the exception being possibly a rushed ending.This film is quite touching. As far as Disney movies go I would say that this one is one that could be a tear jerker. So it hits on the emotional side, especially the scene where Dumbo goes to visit his mother.Also the music is quite good with some songs that stand out in the Disney universe of songs. When I see an elephant fly is a great fun song, Baby Mine is a sad touching song, and Pink Elephants on parade is a crazy song that you cant help but remember.So I would definitely rank this as one of the best Disney movies ever. IT has a great main character, a fast paced story, and some pretty good music. Highly recommended."
68,Dumbo,9,30 July 2008,A film that beautifully the runs the emotional spectrum,"I guess back in the day ""Dumbo"" was my visual crack cocaine. My parents always used to tell me that they were almost driven to madness by how often I requested that to play across the screen. I decided to buy it the other night and even though its been a good 20 years I have already watched it three times through . I still appear to have a penchant for this cinematic gem, albeit for different reasons. Back in the day I was probably drawn to the great animation, anthropomorphism, and catchy soundtrack which are still good but not the main draw for me now. The film just has this certain touch to it that I difficult to pen. It's a relatively dark as far as Disney films go. To see him come out full of joy and vigor only for his soul to get crushed by his derisive peers throughout the film is one of the moist poignant things I have seen in a long time. When ""Baby Mine"" comes soothingly in during the restrictive rendezvous with his mother it is pitiful and yet so heart warming. This is by far the best Disney film that was created. I would be lying if I said I wasn't made teary eyed during the film. Old habits die hard I guess."
69,Dumbo,,1 January 2008,Earns a special place in your heart,"Dumbo is a 64 minute film, very short compared to other movies. But Dumbo is better made and more entertaining than a lot of films today!After a long wait, the day is finally here for Mrs Jumbo, a circus elephant, who has been waiting for her baby for a long while. But when the Stork delivers her baby, she is surprised to find he has enormous ears, almost the size of 3 elephants ears put together! Her baby is nicknamed 'Dumbo' by the size of his ears, and is ridiculed among the rest of the elephants. After a large fiasco, his mother is locked away and he is forced to fend for himself with a herd who won't accept him and treat him as an equal. But Dumbo, with his only friend, Timothy Mouse, emerge successful, and make his mother proud.I love the songs, especially ""Baby Mine"", which is emotional, and if you can't cry during ""Baby Mine"", you are heartless! Even ""Look Out For Mr Stork"" was catchy and sweet. ""Pink Elephants On Parade"" is also very entertaining, and depicts Dumbo's drunken hallucinations, though the video was more fun than the song itself. It reminded me of the Heffalumps And Woozles song from Winnie The Pooh slightly, they are similar.For a film made in the 40s, the animation of Dumbo is fabulous. Everything was perfected, from the trains to the giraffes. And Dumbo was just too cute. The floppy ears, the ADORABLE and innocent smile, the child-eyes that melt hearts. There is nothing not to like about him.One of Disney's classics!"
70,Dumbo,6,26 December 2017,"Dumbo Has All the Ingredients for a Disney Classic, But it's so Short...","One of Disney's classics, though after seventy-five years its reputation may have outpaced the film itself. After the financial disappointments of Pinocchio and Fantasia a year earlier, the studio tightened its belt on Dumbo in an attempt to make up for the losses. It worked in one sense, giving Disney the box office victory it needed, but that penny-pinching and corner-cutting hurt the finished product. It's astonishingly short, barely weighing in at an hour including credits, which forces a sudden, jarring climax. The story's pace is quite smooth until then, taking its time to build characters and back-story, so by contrast the immediate rush to wrap everything up in a frenzied flash is disruptive. While it's cruising along in the first half, though, things are good enough. Speckled with colorful characters and a fresh circus setting, it bottles that classic, emotive Disney magic while still taking a few risks. The infamous pink elephant scene, in particular, is an unexpectedly surreal animator's playground that's several decades ahead of the curve. I was shocked to find offbeat similarities Danny Elfman's work in the film's score, too, which may suggest an even broader influence. Playful and heartfelt, though deeply under-cooked, Dumbo feels like a breezy short story when compared to the richer, more complete films elsewhere in the studio's early catalog."
71,Dumbo,,14 September 2017,Amazing animation and predictable plot,"This is maybe the shortest Disney feature-length animated film, with only sixty-four minutes run-time. Therefore, as you can imagine, the story in it is rather simple. Not only that, the plot is also predictable in the sense that it is just a story that a down-on-his-luck protagonist works all his way up and finally makes it. However, the animation, although uncomplicated, is truly amazing. The titular character Dumbo is one of the most influential animated characters of all time. Also, the parade sequence of the pink elephants is pretty impressive."
72,Dumbo,7,8 March 2016,My review on Dumbo,I seen this over a month ago and I forgot to write a review on it. The film is about this elephant who gets sent by a delivery bird who gives the baby to an elephant who longs to have a child. Of course though the baby elephant has big ears(as he was born with big ears) and everyone at the circus mocks Dumbo(the name of the elephant btw). Dumbo later meets a mouse who acts as his confidant and together they get used to the circus. The animation in this is very good and the charcthers are very well written too. Dumbo doesn't talk at all mind you as he is a muted charcther. Overall I enjoyed it and liked it for what it is.Enjoyable.
73,Dumbo,8,24 December 2015,8 - Great,"It's a touching story of a baby elephant separated from his mother and having to raise himself. His giant ears often caused him to be a source of ridicule but he eventually learns to use them as a strength to prove his doubters wrong.The Jim Crow birds are obvious racial stereotypes and that's one of the sour points of this movie, but they nonetheless, help Dumbo realize his full potential. One of the more interesting parts of the movie is when Dumbo gets drunk and starts to see colorful illusions in the sky.All in all, it's an emotional movie about mother-and-son, trial and triumph. It's great for kids, and as an adult it affects me too."
74,Dumbo,8,7 January 2012,Dumb Pink Elephants!,"(WARNINGThis is the Adult Disney Review Series. I have 51 Original Disney Cartoons to tackle, plus multiple  and forgettable  direct-to-Disney-Video misses. My goal in 2012 is to brave the task of watching all, many for the first time and commenting on eachall with an adult POV. Now, as soon as I can find an adult to do just thatDumbo had me at the start. For one, it followed the enormously long and BORING Fantasia and it stayed a quaint 64 minutes. Thanks, Disney! Also, it was cute, funny, enduring and simple. That last one is, in fact, appreciative, when it comes to what I conceive as the perfect Feature-Length Disney Animated film.You see, if you haven't seen it, the baby elephant Dumbo comes from the stork. Make that, all animals come from the stork  look, they only had about an hour of screen time and not enough to give sex-ed to the kiddies. Dumbo's Dropped in on his single mother and the circus train full of animals carries onto the next town. Only, there's a twist! Dumbo (originally named Jumbo Jr.) has big ears  large enough for the bitching bitches, i.e. fellow female elephants, to gossip & taunt the little fella.But, there's hope! Jiminy Cricket, er, I mean, Timothy Q. Mouse, befriends him, gives him confidence and showmanship! Soon, Dumbo will be the star.Oh, and I forgot, there's a sad and ruthless separation of mom-&-son. Thankfully, fame will buy that conclusion  oops, sorry, Spoiler Alert!The movie was cute, had some decent songs and heartfelt. In particular were the very touching scenes between mom and Dumbo. And that all said, it did have one bad scene that tore it down a full star: the drunk number.Out of left-field and pot-induced, which seems to be a trend of Disney's cartoons, the baby elephant and pal inadvertently get drunk and apparently hallucinate pink elephants and other weird scenes. It was so out-of-place and irrelevant, I was rather put off by it. And it went on and on. It was almost as if the writers didn't have enough faith in their work to write an entire  gulp  60 minute script. (Just an FYI: Alcohol, whether served to an adult or an infant, is NOT a hallucinogen.)Also, I understand the gossipin' gals in the group furthered the story along, but BOY, do I hate those bitches. In cartoons or in real life. They disgust me to the point of me turning away.Even thoughthey were part of my favorite scene in the movie: the Pyramid of Elephants and the eventual collapse. It was silly, fun, funny and actually kind of joyful to watch that.Best quote: ""Dumbo, you're a climax!"" Man, I wish I could be called that.Nowonto Bambi"
75,Dumbo,8,12 May 2009,The Little Film That Could,"With a few financial bombs under his belt, Walt Disney's company was ready to fly or fail. And this little wonder glided straight to the bank. With most of his animators on strike, a strangled budget and a severely abbreviated time length, he was able to create what the world craved: magic in the true Disney style. The less expensive watercolors added a brilliant vibrancy to the backgrounds, and he stuck to his guns releasing it as an A-film with no additions to the running time.As for the film itself, it has all the elements: humorous characters from the stork to the crows. A catchy and memorable score. A tear-jerking rendition of Baby-Mine. A character you could cheer for, though he said no word, and snobby villains you delighted to triumph over. Tight pacing that moves briskly along without losing you. I can scarcely believe it when the film draws to a close.My criticisms: while admittedly imaginative and not long enough to really throw a kink in the pace, I am not a fan of Pink Elephants on parade. It's just too weird and acid-trippy. A baby elephant gets drunk and is chased on screen by hallucinations of elephant-demons- you have to admit it's freakin weird. Though I will give my props on making it one of the most memorable scenes in animation, even if just because it is so terrifying.Overall, I have to admit to liking Dumbo for what it is- a cute and very entertaining little film. It's wonderful for its intended audience and far from unwatchable as you get older.Quote of the Film:-Did you ever see an elephant fly? -Well, I've seen a horse fly. -Ah, I've seen a dragon fly. -Hee-hee. I've seen a house fly."
76,Dumbo,8,20 May 2003,Really stands the test of time!,"Even after 60 years, the animation is still dazzling to watch! Love that pink elephant scene! But it's the story and songs that really get me. Can't get that ""I be done seen about everything, till I seen an elephant fly"" out of my head! My favorite song by far. I do agree with one other comment that it is a bit dark, but it was made during a completely different era. I'm sure if it was made today, it would be more sanitized and more PC. But what I appreciate the most is the way the storytellers contrasted the absolute sweetness and gentleness of Dumbo with those who sought to exploit and humiliate him. Good down to earth rendition of good vs. not so good!"
77,Dumbo,9,5 December 2002,"61 years, and still as fresh as ever","In this very dark cartoon about an elephant with large ears, Walt Disney had it perfectly down pat how anyone who is different is treated, all the way down to the ""perfectly harmless remark"" bit.  Anyone who has been teased and tormented through the years can attest to the fact that Disney must have understood how Dumbo felt.In the end Dumbo is accepted by his community.  Why?  Not because any of the animals have grown a heart and have true love, but because his ears are suddenly useful to them.This film should be shown to classrooms."
78,Dumbo,,4 September 1999,It's so touching!,"I think it's one of Disney's real masterpieces. The little outsider with the big ears becomes a star just because of this handicap. It's a pity that everybody talks about ""Dumbo, the flying elephant"", so that everybody knows how the story ends. The most touching scene is when Dumbo goes to see his mother in prison: Although I know what's coming (because I've seen it several times): I always feel tears when Dumbo starts crying when his mother sings him asleep gently."
79,Dumbo,,7 May 1999,wonderful,"yes, the separation from the mother is scary. yes, the baby mine scene is sad (i choke up EVERY time i see it). but the story has a happy ending and a wonderful message and every child can relate to character of dumbo.  i don't think the crows are racist-- dated stereotypes, to be sure, but in no way malicious (they are positive characters and i doubt any kids even realize that they are supposed to be black since the associations today are different than they were in '41).  and what could be cooler and more eyepopping than the pink elephants on parade sequence?  i love that the film was kept to simple and short- it serves the story perfectly.  this film is matched in magic only by pinocchio."
80,Dumbo,9,5 April 2002,A fine movie it is,"I saw 1941 last week and when the general watches Dumbo in the cinema it all came back to me again, and I ran out and got myself this movie. This was the first movie I ever saw in the Cinema, together with my father who died not long after. I was 4 or 5 at the time and I really was fascinated by it then and still am now, maybe it is because of the personal memories I have of it, maybe it is because this is a great move, but I think so. The scene where Dumbo is outside and is mother is behind bars, but still they are able to cuddle. This made me cry, just like the Major General Joseph W. Stillwell. The crows (I've seen a horse fly, I've seen a house fly, but I no nay never seen an elephant fly) the clowns, the magic feather. What a brilliant movie."
81,Dumbo,,21 February 2001,Daring,"This is probably, along with ""Akira,"" one of the more daring and dangerous animated films made.  Not saying it is bad, it is not at all dangerous to children, but a few of the ideas and themes in the film are shocking, especially for a Family Picture, making this one of the greats.First off, Dumbo being separated from his mother is one of the worst things that could happen to a young child.  Seeing his mother take action against the children at the circus can be a bit frightening. And seeing her in the cage is such a sad sequence.  The Crows that help Dumbo are stereotypical of African-Americans, but it *was* made in 1941. Watch ""Holiday Inn"" and tell me if the crows are still too bad.You can't write a review of ""Dumbo"" without mentioning the psychedelic ""Pink Elephants On Parade"" sequence, brought on by Dumbo's drinking of wine. This sequence is reminiscent of the ""Huphalumps and Woosles"" in ""Winnie The Pooh"" or the cards in ""Alice In Wonderland"" or basically anything in ""Fantasia.""Finally, Dumbo learns that he can fly at the end and does... and uses his power to get revenge on those that have wronged him.  Watch the sequence when the elephant tower collapses and you see that elephants pain-induced expression, it will leave a mark on you.With the juxtaposition of brighter-than-possible scenes and extremely dark ones, ""Dumbo"" is a surreal bit of animated film.  And I love every minute of it."
82,Dumbo,,23 November 1999,My favourite animated movie of all time,I can't read about this movie without getting a tear in my eye. It's pure brilliance. Uplifting and saddening at the same time... It's one of those movies that you really love.
83,Dumbo,10,20 July 2005,A great Disney Classic!,"I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities. The animation in My opinion was crisp, clean, and really clear. Not to mention beautiful! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious Looney Tunes characters that we all love. in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen. In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do! If you like the original Looney Tunes and animated films then I strongly recommend that you watch this movie today!"
84,Dumbo,10,11 January 2003,Best animated picture in movie History!!,"The reason Dumbo is my favorite cartoon is because of the way that Disney accomplishes the fact to create only brilliant scenes,from the bombastic opening titles to the unavoidable happy end,with the undisputed highlight:The Drunken Dream sequence! That scene has almost stayed in my memory since I saw it for the first time,probably about 5 or 6 years old.Now,at 22,I still think that this scene is the best scene ever in animation.The way that the song combines with the dances and constant change of characters(Pink Elephants!) is just superb.The way that Disney takes care of every small detail is also beautiful to watch and probably best seen in the train sequence with all the different animals and their ways.The music score is also very very good,with circus music of course but also a couple of great songs(the drunken dream song of course but also the song of the ravens,the scene after the dream. The message of Disney in this movie is probably their best,the outcast who becomes,with help from a tiny mouse,the great hero!Dumbo is the perfection of animated movies and will always be remembered as one of the all time classics! 10/10"
85,Dumbo,10,15 May 2014,Is Racism Rife In This Beloved Children's Classic?,"As a Disney classic made on the cheap to recoup the losses after Fantasia (1940) you can't fault this film for its charm. It tells the story of the mute baby elephant Dumbo as he goes through a series of trials and humiliations before learning to fly and having his ears insured for a million dollars. Quaint. Charming and quaint to be sure.What you can fault this film for, however, is its racism. Musical number 'Song Of The Roustabouts' which depicts a gang of African-American work- hands is awful by today's standards and was pretty horrendous even for the time (""We work all day/ We work all night/ We never learned to read or write""), I mean do you really want to be showing your kids this stuff? Not to mention the gang of shady stereotypes who croon out the regrettably catchy When I See An Elephant Fly (sung by Cliff Edwards and The Hall Johnson Choir as ""when I see a elephant fly"").It just strikes me as rather odd that in this day and age we still throw this stuff in front of our most impressionable minds and don't have the forethought to think about what's actually on screen. A group of faceless black men who's only purpose appears to be working for the man is really not the sort of thing that I want my kids to be told is normal. Yes, some might explain it away as a product of the times, or simply ignore it under some half-formed 'the magic of Disney' excuse, but the fact still remains that at least two of the major sequences in this film are prime examples of insidious racism.Still though, as an adult this film does have its merits. I mean, the Pink Elephants On Parade sequence is certainly inspired if a little terrifying, and the animation, while generally basically constructed, has its moments of stylistic grandeur. When Timothy Mouse's shadow throws out its Nosferatu shadow a la F.W Murnau, for instance, was a real delight to see. It also has the interesting historical distinction of being the second of only two classic Disney films to have had their backgrounds done solely in watercolours (the other being Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs (1937)).But, overall I've got to say that Dumbo really isn't one of the finest achievements to ever come out of the Disney studious. The storyline is, to be frank, utter nonsense and is poorly executed with the thing jumping from sequence to sequence with no real rhyme or reason. Nevertheless, there'll always be a small fondness for the floppy eared pachyderm in my heart (and I'm willing to bet the hearts of others), and for early animated cinema it is a considerable landmark. All I'm saying is that you should probably have a good, hard think before you sit your children down in front of it and consider it wholly innocent."
86,Dumbo,9,19 March 2016,Dumbo,"What strikes me about this film is its length and simplicity. It's only over an hour long, and the main character is silent. It's a simple story about an outcast trying to get along in an unjust world with the help of an unlikely friend. It's simple, to the point and the underlying message touched me more than it ever did as a child.Disney's fourth animated classic tells us the story of Jumbo Jr., or Dumbo. Dumbo, the large eared, big hearted child of Mrs Jumbo, is ridiculed by the rest of the elephants at the zoo. He's very close to his mother, and is devastated and left alone when she is locked away after defending her son from a nasty little boy. Rejected from his kind, and the laughing stock of the circus, Dumbo is befriended by Timoty Q Mouse, who sees nothing wrong with the youngster's apparent disfigurement. With Timothy's help, the silent elephant learns that it matters not what one looks like, but what you're made of, and that you can learn to use your weakness as your vehicle to achieve greatness.Dumbo himself is just adorable. I love silent characters like this, who convey emotion through action, expression and noises. He says so much by saying so little. I loved him.The message of hope in the face of adversity is profound and done beautifully here. It isn't hammered in. It teaches us not to judge on looks alone, but to look beyond it. An age old lesson, but done here so well that it feels fresh and new. As someone with disabilities, this film touched my heart; Timothy is truly what a great friend should be. If there was more people like him, we'd have far less problems in the world. The relationship between Dumbo and his mother is just lovely, and the song ""Baby Mine"" made me see how much I love my own mother. I feel for little Dumbo; my mother is my rock, and if I lost her I don't know what I'd do. He's a brave little guy, no doubt.It surprised me that the humans and circus workers didn't seem to hate Dumbo at all. It was all the elephants (and that one boy who took it too far). Your own kind can me much crueler than others.The animation is beautiful, especially the little details they added such as rain and flags blowing in the wind. I was pleased that the animators showed Dumbo and his mother rocking side to side after being separated; this is a tell tale sign of depression in elephants.The music is lovely. I've always liked the choir in these older Disney films. In the opening song, they mentioned my hometown, County Cork, which surprised me a great deal. The crow scene didn't bother me in the slightest, I actually found them quite funny. It's a product of the times, and they sing that awesome song. The Pink Elephant scene dragged on a bit too much for me, but the song was cool. I better mention that there's flashing lights in this sequence.The length of the movie is perfect. Any longer and it would have overstayed its welcome. What a lovely little film. A great introduction to Disney for children, and such a pleasure to revisit now as an adult."
87,Dumbo,9,25 February 2011,The cartoon returns...,"I was never the biggest fan of this one, having seen it to death as a child. ""Dumbo"" was in many ways regarded as a lesser Disney classic, never really treated with the same regard as ""Pinocchio"", ""Snow White"" or ""Bambi"". But as I continue to work my way through this studio's classics, I am more than pleasantly surprised to rediscover this gem.With a short running time of 64 minutes, which must barely qualify as film, this was the most cartoonish Disney feature of this era that I had seen, definitely not to the same higher brow animation standards of the afore-mentioned, but funnier and more enjoyable, without a doubt.The little engine that could humour and the overall concept, being more zany that its counterparts help this stand out and being a much more entertaining piece of cinema than I had originally given it credit for. Not the greatest animation in history, but fun none the less."
88,Dumbo,10,26 December 2010,You Don't Believe An Elephant Can Fly??? Watch This Animated Film And See For Youself.,"This is one of the most memorable cartoon film I saw as a young boy. It introduced me to a lovable character that I'll cherish forever. The character is an adorable baby elephant with blue eyes and ears which are longer in proportion to its body, which eventually enable it to fly. Jumbo Junior is its name. However it has the nickname of Dumbo.Plot: While circus animals are being transported, Mrs. Jumbo, one of the elephants, receives her baby from a stork. The baby elephant is quickly taunted by the other elephants because of his large ears, and they nickname him ""Dumbo"".Once the circus is set up, Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper at a group of boys for making fun of her son, and she is locked up and deemed mad. Dumbo is shunned by the other elephants and with no mother to care for him, he is now alone, except for a self-appointed mentor and protector, Timothy Q. Mouse, who feels sympathy for Dumbo and becomes determined to make him happy again.The circus director makes Dumbo the top of an elephant pyramid stunt, but Dumbo's ears causes the stunt to go wrong, injuring the other elephants and bringing down the big top. Dumbo is made a clown as a result, and plays the main role in an act that involves him falling into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity and fame, Dumbo hates this job and is now more miserable than ever.To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to visit his mother. On the way back Dumbo cries and then starts to hiccup so Timothy decides to take him for a drink of water from a bucket which, unknown to him, has accidentally had a bottle of champagne knocked into it. As a result, Dumbo and Timothy both become drunk and see hallucinations of pink elephants (the famous Pink Elephants on Parade sequence).The next morning, Dumbo and Timothy wake up in a tree. Timothy wonders how they got up in the tree, and concludes that Dumbo flew up there using his large ears as wings. With the help of a group of crows, Timothy is able to get Dumbo to fly again, using a psychological trick of a ""magic feather"" to boost his confidence.Back at the circus, Dumbo must perform his stunt of jumping from a high building, this time from a much higher platform. On the way down, Dumbo loses the feather and Timothy tells him that the feather was never magical, and that he is still able to fly. Dumbo is able to pull out of the dive and flies around the circus, finally striking back at his tormentors as the stunned audience looks on in amazement.After this performance, Dumbo becomes a media sensation, Timothy becomes his manager, and Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo are given a private car on the circus train.A famous song in the film ""When I See An Elephant Fly..."":I saw a peanut stand, heard a rubber band, I saw a needle that winked its eye. But I think I will have seen everything When I see an elephant fly.I saw a front porch swing, heard a diamond ring, I saw a polka-dot railroad tie. But I think I will have seen everything when I see an elephant fly.I seen a clothes horse, he r'ar up and buck And they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck I didn't see that, I only heard But just to be sociable I'll take your wordI heard a fireside chat, I saw a baseball bat And I just laughed till I thought I'd die But I'd be done see'n about everything when I see an elephant flyAfter its October 23 release, Dumbo proved to be a financial miracle compared to other Disney films. The simple film only cost $813,000 to produce, half the cost of Snow White, less than a third of the cost of Pinocchio, and certainly less than the expensive Fantasia. Dumbo eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release; it and Snow White were the only two pre-1943 Disney features to turn a profit. It was intended for Dumbo to be on the cover of the December 1941 issue of Time, but the idea was dropped when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, resulting in the United States entering World War II and reducing the box office draw of the film.Dumbo won the 1941 Academy Award for Original Music Score, awarded to musical directors Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace. Churchill and lyricist Ned Washington were also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song for ""Baby Mine"" 10/10 points. In short this is a gem of a film and definitely recommend for young children. Buy it on DVD.Email me: Vivekmaru45@yahoo.com for more info on movies and movie-lists."
89,Dumbo,9,15 November 2009,Such a sweet movie,"Seriously, anyone who doesn't think Dumbo is touching is just crazy!Dumbo is such a sweet little guy, even though he doesn't speak, you really feel for him.The downside to this movie is, it's over too quickly. I understand Walt however, Pinocchio and Fantasia were expensive and were not exactly box-office hits, so he had to keep it short and cheap, and anyway, it is great never the less.I can't believe my dad thinks this film is boring-It's just so sweet! It's sad in parts, yet there is humour, and parts just make you go 'Aww'.There's one scene I just can't stop laughing at-When Dumbo and his mouse friend, Timothy, get drunk. Really, it's too funny! But I won't spoil it, but I will say, wow, kids films back then could really get away with anything! So, Dumbo is a terrific Disney film. No doubt!"
90,Dumbo,,19 July 2004,A charming film from The Mousetro (SOME SPOILERS),"I saw Dumbo several times when I was really (I mean REALLY) young, and forgot about it till just a month ago, when I got it on DVD. This is one of the most touching, short, perfect films ever. Nobody should have to pass their childhood without seeing it.The story is incredibly simple. It isn't cluttered by subplots, it doesn't have more than one story line, it's just a straightforward fable of how a baby elephant rises to fame, but not before being ridiculed for his foolishly immense ears, named Dumbo, and worst of all being ostracized from his mother. But he is rescued by Timothy Q. Mouse, a fast-talking rodent who is the one guy who pities Dumbo. In the end, Dumbo finds his ears are perfect as wings. After the animators so perfectly portray his innocent joy, we see a great change in Dumbo. He suddenly punishes the clowns who made fun of him, shoots peanuts at the nasty elephants like a bombadier circling overhead. I know everyone who was punished for their horrid conduct towards the mute protagonist deserved what they got. But still, I can't help thinking: Is this really Dumbo? I would have expected him to just smile joyously and simply speed-dive into his mother. I just didn't seem like the kind of guy to punish wrongdoers. That's what most heroes do, they beat up the baddies, but Dumbo seemed more like the kind of character to mind his own business, content to be with his mother and not be picked on, not giving a hoot whether the rest of the world ran amok or not.Despite the last bit, I love Dumbo. The animation is very rounded, warm and welcoming. The cuteness of Dumbo knows no bounds. This is made even more noticeable when Dumbo's ears are revealed when he sneezes, as they were previously tucked back neatly. After everyone sees his ears, the scenes don't look quite so happy. After his mother tries to protect him from a redheaded brat, Skinny, she's labelled ""mad elephant"" and locked up. After the loss of his mother, all the layouts are dark and sad, reflecting how Dumbo feels. Even the circus' obligatory brightness seems in some way menacing, although the look isn't really different at all. The animation is very simple, not bothering with great detail, but just portraying a cartoon animal, without the added bother of fur, wrinkles and such like.The character of Dumbo is groundbreaking. It's a great achievement to make a pure, meaningful film without the title character uttering a single word. The medium of animation often expresses emotion better without verbal support. Add to that that the movie really emphasizes Dumbo as an innocent baby who isn't responsible for his long ears, and dialog would ruin the baby image. What makes the meanness of the outside world look even worse is the fact that Dumbo can't even say anything about it. Timothy is a great character. That's nothing more than what you'd expect, for mice are always portrayed favorably in Disney, for obvious reasons. You just love him for helping Dumbo when no one else will. He's also quite the talker, persuading the ringmaster to use Dumbo as his climax, and bringing a bunch of nasty Afro-American crows to tears with a dramatic rendition of Dumbo's tragic story. Which brings us to the crows, presumably cousins of the vultures in The Jungle Book. Both are outcasts themselves, both make fun of the outcast hero before accepting him with an excellent song and then helping him. Mowgli and Dumbo develop friendships with their feathered acquaintances the same way. No one could ever talk about Dumbo without mentioning the ""Pink Elephants On Parade"" sequence. A year too late to make the cut for Fantasia, but certainly a surreal, colorful, innovative sequence. It's one of the best animated sequences ever, with lots of strange shots, like when you only see highlights of two waltzing elephants. Timothy and Dumbo endure this nightmare after accidentally imbibing the clowns' champagne. The crows' song ""When I See An Elephant Fly"" is one I battled with for a long time, trying to get it out of my head. I failed, needless to say. ""Baby Mine"" is one of the most touching sequences in animation history. The eyes and and the trunk (!) of the two elephants express the mother and son's feelings far better than words. All Dumbo can see of Mrs. Jumbo is her trunk, which cradles him through the bars of Mrs. Jumbo's tiny cell window, as he cries.
Okay, enough of the sadness and despair, the movie! Dumbo is one of the great Disney movies, immortal. Short, simple, basic, yet spectacular in its own simple way. It doesn't try to be Fantasia or Pinocchio. It doesn't go for extravagance. It doesn't wanna be the immortal masterpiece. It just aims to tell a good animated story. Yet in its unambitious SIMPLICITY it manages to do most of that."
91,Dumbo,,25 December 2003,"A great movie, really...","A great movie! Cute, beautiful one! Actually I have seen it only after my thirties - but I have cried too, it's so touching... It's great movie about mothership, friendship and love with briliant songs and innovative ""pink elephants"". I just don't understand the comments about ""afro-americans"". I just don't get it - if crows are black it doesn't mean that they DO symbolize Afro-Americans and DO display them in wrong way! I loved the crows, they are cool! Please, go away with this great-movie-spoiling racist paranoia. Go get some Nazi propaganda movies from thirties and SEE THE DIFFERENCE. You would shame yourself after that for ever accusing the Disney!"
92,Dumbo,7,19 August 1999,A Disney classic that shows its age.,"This is a cute, poignant movie with a lot of memorable sequences and good songs.  However, I have to agree that it's surprising that Disney got away with the whole Pink Elephant sequence, even if it WAS 1941.  And the crows...I don't think I would quite call it racist, but definately stereotypical.  It's very odd to watch this movie in current times.  But all in all, a classic."
93,Dumbo,,9 July 1999,"Good, but...","Definitely a classic, but on re-watching it I took to thinking....In terms of plot-line, it's a pretty long run for a short slide, isn't it? You sort of wonder what happened to the movie about the flying elephant, when he only flies the last 10 minutes or so.  Granted, what would you at that point that wouldn't be boring, but it does seem to end somewhat precipitously.Also, watch the development of the plot: Dumbo's born, he's treated badly by the other elephants, so is his mother, he makes a friend, etc... All handled quite well.  Ah, but his fortunes turn around.  How?  Why, by getting drunk. Somehow that doesn't seem right.  The modern child for whom this movie would be suited probably is too young to understand much about drunkenness.. and probably shouldn't!  To be sure, this movie is from 1941, the audience and society and standards were different then.  Also, I'm not generally one to blow a PC-whistle, but I could probably have done without his being teased and then helped by a bunch of *genuine* Jim Crows (let's face it, that's what the movie made them).  Again, a product of its times.So, yes, it remains a good movie, but somehow misses something when I watch it now."
94,Dumbo,,17 November 1998,One of Disney's best,Up there with Bambi and Mary Poppins as one of Disney's best features.  It's funny and touching at the same time and the pink elephants are the best!
95,Dumbo,,27 June 2004,Microcosm,"Phase I Disney material.  By comparison to Phase III (Beauty & Beast, Lion King, Aladdin) this is edgier.  Sure, they punch our ""cuteness"" buttons, but this movie has more to it.  Only 'Hercules' has done such an reflection of the Disney machine at work.Something like a spoiler warning...This movie really sums up prewar America.  Anyone who thinks this is a sweet story is blind.  Consider:--Heavy racial stereotypes.  The crows are obviously Blacks (as is the gorilla) so Ralph Bakshi used that theme for his 70s satire.  Compare this to 'Remember the Titans' where the crows were the victims and the ""white boy"" was only a miscellaneous outcast.--Listen to the lyrics of the working Roustabouts.  Probably the most depressing Disney music until 'Song of the South'.--The frequent militarist themes and images, some directly taken from 'Triumph of the Will'.  Remember that Disney was one of the largest distributors of nationalist propaganda during WWII, one such mascot was Dumbo.--The circus is tyranny and the gossiping elephants (""proud race"") are Nazis.  So, Dumbo's escape and triumph becomes all the more patriotic. Orwell copied this for '1984'.--Having lost his mother, Dumbo gets drunk, hallucinates and has one heck of a hangover.So where does Disney invest itself?  The ""search for a climax.""  This was after a few financial travesties so Disney needed a savior.  The story itself was a freak to the writers and barely got to Walt as it was.  What makes this good?--Modern Disney musicals are constructed in the MTV fashion of flashy colors and cuts.  Up until 'Little Mermaid' the method of music was appreciative meditation.  Just examine the ""Baby Mine"" sequence, a far cry from anything we've seen in the last 15 years.--Because Dumbo doesn't talk, he is reliant on expression like few other Disney characters.  The only other one that pops to mind is the Golden Eagle in 'Rescuers Down Under'.  These represent the epitome of the Disney design team.  Notice how the art is focused on the eyes.  Now compare it to the repressed designs of the Disney princesses, it seems Disney is better at animals when they don't have to worry about them speaking.  From here we get 'Luxo Jr.' and Phase IV.--Early use of morphing animation during ""Pink Elephants"".  This is still effective after 60+ years.  Sure, Gerald Scarfe used it in 'Pink Floyd', but it's not until the recent advances in computer technology where morphing has become more common.  Now who will change our outlook on the process?--In the finale, Disney completes the circle by flaunting the publicity machine (something they've exploited ever since) and announcing 'Dumbo: The Movie'.  'Bill & Ted 2' used the same gag in its credits.With those in mind, this goes on my Top 10 Disney films and it has nothing to do with sentimental attachment.  Well, maybe it does.  If you don't cry during the ""Baby Mine"" scene, you really are a heartless Nazi.Final Analysis = = Learn from this..."
96,Dumbo,4,8 July 2012,Another Disney movie I found hard to like as a child.,"I think if I would describe this movie with one word it would be ""depressing"". It's hard to watch all these characters being so cruel to a little baby elephant who doesn't even have the voice to defend himself against it all. I disliked this movie as a child, because so much in this movie feels mean-spirited and upsetting. I remember thinking I was glad the movie was over, instead of actually being happy for the characters, since I was left with such a bad mood after all that had happened.I also found the Pink Elephant Parade creepy and it really serves no point to the plot. As for the songs, I didn't really like them much. ""Baby Mine"" was the only one I truly liked.The animation is great though."
97,Dumbo,10,6 December 2011,"A True Classic, My Personal Favorite","for me, 'Dumbo' is the quintessential Disney classic and personally, my favorite of all Disney films animated or otherwise. i consider 'Pinocchio' to be Disney's ultimate achievement in filmmaking and 'Dumbo' to actually be his second best, but 'Pinocchio' is too disturbing and full of a lot of moralizing and archetypal imagery to be actually charming and fun. 'Dumbo' has it's dark and sad moments, but it's basically a pretty funny cartoon and is a lot more light and spontaneous than ""Pinocchio' which often reveals little more than it's dark, troubled nature. the imagery in ""Pinocchio' is also more heavy handed.if you don't know the story to 'Dumbo' that's your loss. it's a film everyone should see and a lot of people have. so there's little need to go into any detail about the plot. most people know it's about a baby elephant with big ears who can fly.also, as anyone who's seen it knows, there are many lessons to be learned here. mostly distressing ones, but interesting life lessons to contemplate none the less.'Dumbo' had the lowest budget of any Disney animated feature from the past. i think that was a asset. on a larger budget 'Dumbo' would have been too pretentious or heavy handed. simplicity is what this little story needs to fly.it really is a funny, charming little cutie. it's about little circus animals, baby choo-choo trains, a teeny mouse who saves the day, and about how every child had a mommy. even if you never knew her, you had one. it's also about nasty circus clowns and smart alecky black crows.if there is anything to for parents to be cautious about, there's, of course, the casual consumption of smoking and alcohol often found in older cartoons. there is also the fact that 'Dumbo' is also somewhat of a revenge scenario at the end and might inspire certain types to entertain retaliation. as for racism? of course not, that's stupid. any kid who has ever seen a rap music video or the Wayans black films nows how a lot of black people can act and this depiction is not very different from any of that.everybody should jump aboard the Casey Jr. circus train and experience the circus with 'Dumbo'. no matter how old you are you just might get something out of it. not all of it's pretty, but it's always cute and ultimately very funny."
98,Dumbo,,3 November 2011,The Vidiot Reviews...,"DumboWhile human beings runaway to join the circus, wild animals, on the other hand, are more inclined to run away from the circus.Either way, the elephant in this cartoon had no choice as to where he would grow-up.Delivered to a travelling circus via stork, Dumbo, a pint-sized pachyderm with over-sized ears, becomes the target of cruel circus goers.Defending her son's honour, Mrs. Jumbo strikes out at the taunting youths, which lands her in isolation, and Dumbo all alone.Luckily, he meets a motivated mouse (Edward Brophy) that shows him the ropes of big-top living and helps him realize the true potential of his unfortunate, yet aerodynamic, attributes.Though it is considered to be one of Disney's saddest cartoons, Dumbo is also one of its most inspiring.So, if you have a physical deformity like Dumbo, rest assured: There'll always be a place for you in the circus. (Green Light)"
99,Dumbo,10,27 January 2011,I want an elephant for  myself!,"When I was a kid I remember I loved to watch ""Dumbo"". But it's been so long since I watched it that I didn't remember why, except for the part when ""Dumbo"" and the mouse get drunk and start seeing things - I loved that so much that I never forgot it. So, today, after many years, I watched it all over again. And I was mesmerized. ""Dumbo"" is adorable; every time he was sad I has to control myself so much not to cry with him. And when he smiled I just wanted to hug the computer screen. Plus, this talks about judgment: we usually judge people by their looks and that is wrong; very, very wrong. Dumbo was fooled by everybody because of his ears and, in the end, he became the most important animal in the circus. Other thing that the movie talks as well, is the way how some circus, sometimes, treat animals. I hate circus with animals: animals belong in the wild and, if for some reason they aren't able to return to the wild, they belong in a zoo or some kind of reservation so they can live their lives in the happiest way possible. However, this was a small movie that made me smile very much. Maybe this one was responsible for my love for elephants..."
100,Dumbo,7,30 August 2007,"Not consistent through its rather brief run, but still not bad after over 65 years","I first saw this early full-length Disney effort when I was no older than five. I enjoyed it at the time, even though I didn't know exactly what it was about. I don't recall watching it any time after that while growing up, so my memory of it was fairly vague before I watched it for the first time in ages earlier this year. When I finally did that, I was impressed enough to give it an 8/10. However, after another viewing very recently, I can't give it a rating higher than 7/10.Mrs. Jumbo is a circus elephant who gets a baby delivered to her by Mr. Stork. When this baby arrives, she names him Jumbo Jr. The other elephants like this newborn, until they see that he has abnormally large ears, which causes them to ridicule him, and dub him ""Dumbo"". Sadly, it gets worse for the young elephant. Circusgoers begin to torment him, and when his mother tries to stop this, she ends up being locked away. Now separated from his mother, the only one who cares for him, and shunned by the other elephants, things are going terribly for Dumbo, but fortunately, a good-natured mouse named Timothy quickly becomes his only friend, and begins to help him become a successful performer. However, this isn't the end of Dumbo's troubles.""Dumbo"" is only slightly over an hour long, which is pretty short for a full-length movie. Apparently, it's the shortest full-length Disney film ever made. Because of this, you would think it would be easier to keep it consistent, but there are Disney flicks that are much more consistent than this one, even though they are obviously longer! There are several good things about this 1941 animated feature, including some catchy songs, poignancy, and impressive animation for the time. There's also a bit of humour, though not as much as there often is in Disney animated features. The funniest part is probably where Dumbo and Timothy accidentally get drunk. Personally, despite these merits, I had trouble staying into it the entire time.After over 65 years, ""Dumbo"" is still often considered a classic. Personally, it's not one of those in my book, but many would disagree. Many have adored this movie through the decades, I'm just one person who has been slightly disappointed by it. While it's not something I would want to watch over and over, I think it's still a good animated family feature, and I don't advise anyone to avoid it like the plague, other than those who strongly dislike Disney movies in general. For Disney fans, I would say this 1941 film should at least be watchable, as long as you can get over the racism suggested in the speech of the crows."
101,Dumbo,10,18 March 2007,Timeless Disney classic  an animated movie that will be remembered for as long as films are being made.,"Perhaps the greatest of all the Disney animated movies, ""Dumbo"" was made in 1941 and seems as fresh and moving nowadays as it did back then. If ever the term ""timeless"" could be applied to a film, it must surely be this one. The truly remarkable thing is that nearly seventy years have gone by since this film was first shown, yet the central theme - somebody's life being one long miserable struggle because of a physical defect  is still totally relevant. How many kids face daily humiliation because of the size of their ears, the colour of their hair, a blemish on their skin, a problem with their eyes, the appearance of their teeth, or their weight? ""Dumbo"" is a story to bring hope and warmth to every person who has ever felt self-conscious, and to heap shame upon any person who has ever victimised another because of how they look.One night, the animals of a travelling circus show are brought babies by the storks. But for an elephant called Mrs Jumbo it is a sad night. As she watches all her friends get their new babies, she slowly realises that the storks do not seem to have a tiny elephant for her, even though she was expecting one. The next day brings a wonderful surprise though. A stork arrives  better late than never!  with a baby elephant for the despondent Mrs Jumbo. She is overjoyed and proudly announces that his name will be Jumbo Jr. Then, the little baby sneezes and from the side of his head unfurl the most impossibly big ears that anyone has ever seen. Pretty soon, Jumbo Jr. is the joke of the circus, laughed at and ridiculed by all, and cruelly nicknamed Dumbo by the other female elephants. One day, some mischievous children visit the circus and tease Dumbo; when Mrs Jumbo reacts violently towards them, she is taken away and locked in a cage away from her baby and the rest of the circus. A determined circus mouse called Timothy befriends Dumbo, and promises to make him a star. After many misfiring attempts to fulfil his vow, Timothy finally hits upon the inspirational idea of using Dumbo's massive ears  perfect wings, as he calls them - to achieve flight. Overnight, Dumbo goes from being the butt of everyone's jokes to the world's first flying elephant, a celebrated star of the circus and the most remarkable animal on earth!It's hard to know where to start when recommending this film. The animation is marvellous for the time, and the voice acting is simply superb. Edward Brophy as Timothy and Sterling Holloway as the stork are particular stand-outs. The film has some catchy songs, the best of which are the now-classic ""Elephants On Parade"" and ""When I See An Elephant Fly"", the latter brilliantly performed by a bunch of comical crows. But the most significant factor of all is the simplicity of the story  it is so relevant and inspiring and well-told that it is unlikely this film will ever lose its appeal. A film has been created here that will remain popular and effective for as long as films are around  I won't be here to find out, but I'll wager that 200 years from now ""Dumbo"" will still be cherished by children of all ages all over the world."
102,Dumbo,10,3 October 2006,"""Baby Mine"" has to be one of my two favorite ""Dumbo"" songs.","I don't have the ""Dumbo"" DVD yet, but I'd love to have it. My two favorite songs from the movie are ""Baby Mine"" and ""Pink Elephants On Parade."" Ever since the first time I saw the scene ""Baby Mine"" it's been a tearjerker; I can't hear the piece or see the scene without choking up now. Mrs. Jumbo only tries to protect her baby and because of that she's labeled a mad elephant, put in chains and locked in a trailer. Every time I see ""Pink Elephants On Parade"" I find myself singing along with it. I love the song and the scene. I also noticed that during the whole movie, the hyenas (mother and her three babies) were only seen once, during the ""Baby Mine"" scene. If I could rate this movie an '11', I would."
103,Dumbo,10,22 August 2004,A Cute Disney Film,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*""Dumbo"" was one of the cutest films and cartoon characters there ever was. I remember seeing the little elephant with big ears for the first time when I was four years old.  The plot of the movie was very original and even made me want to cry at times.A few months ago I saw this movie for the first time in years and  there was one thing about it that shocked me.  I never noticed when I was a child that Dumbo got drunk causing him to fly.  I couldn't believe they would put this in a Disney film.  Other than that the movie was just as cute and good as I remember it.  My favorite part of the film is when the crows sing ""I've Never Seen An Elephant Fly"".I suggest that anyone who loves Disney movies should see this film and I give it 10/10 stars."

I have to say that this is my favorite Disney film, along with Beauty and the Beast. I have to admit, i don't usually cry when i watch movies. the last movie i've cried in was perhaps The Notebook..which was some pretty sad stuff! I did not expect a cartoon to touch me so much in the way that Dumbo did....i'm 18 for goodness sake! You feel pathos, a Greek word for sympathy, or our passionate response from our irrational being for Dumbo. You usually don't have that character connection in movies nowadays, thus you really don't care what happens to them! But Dumbo...he's different. His childlike innocence draws you in, and simply put, he is SO cute! i really wanted a baby elephant after watching this movie.All in all, this is truly one of the best Disney films ever made. The characters are not one-dimensional, they display real emotion. 10/10!"

I recommend this lovely film to all elephant fans (like moi) and Disney fans (like moi)! :) NOTE: It is very sad (as I have mentioned before, I'm just informing you a second time), so if you're easily upset by films I DO NOT recommend this.Dumbo is brought to Mrs. Jumbo, he is the cutest baby elephant in the film (and the ONLY baby elephant)!

Now, I can't remember when I saw this movie last (most likely as a very little boy), although I do remember flying on the Dumbo elephants at Disneyland USA.This movie has many different moods: it's happy, it's cute, it's sad, etc. everything you needed in a nice family classic! Also, this movie made a milestone as this was the very first animated film to be released on home video, the foundation which was laid for more animated video releases to come!!!!!""Dumbo"" is wonderful. It's fun. And it'll keep you in the show! 10/10"
107,Dumbo,10,2 June 2006,Walt Disney's 64 Minute Masterpiece,"Walt Disney --- like Michaelangelo --- is entitled to have more than one of his superior works referred to as a masterpiece. Dumbo certainly qualifies. Besides the wonderful basic story, there are several standouts in this film: (1) the Casey Jones circus train; (2) the stupendous scene of the roadies erecting the circus tents in a rainstorm, (3) the crows singing ""When I See an Elephant Fly""; (4) the portrayal of the female elephants re: Mrs Dumbo and her child --- so similar to the women in my childhood neighborhood, who were not of course elephants. This movie delivers by the ton in its scant 64 minutes. This is perhaps why it's been re-issued to theaters over and over for decades; why it'll find new life as a DVD next week."
108,Dumbo,10,15 November 2001,Disney's Best Animated Feature,"Believe it or not, I'm an older individual who's never seen this film. Wow! It tells a deceptively simple tale of a handicapped baby elephant (over-sized ears)in a circus beset by uncaring animals and cruel humans, creating low self-esteem and loneliness. Fortunately, a friendly mouse shows him the way to happiness. There's a justifiably famous scene of flying pink elephants during a drunken dream sequence. The choo-choo train itself is a charming character. The finale is exhilarating. But what sets this apart from ALL other animated and any features is the most tender depiction of a mother-child love ever depicted on film, set to a lovely, Heartrending ""Baby Mine"" song. This occurs when Dumbo visits his mother. The fact that Dumbo and mother are non-speaking characters is a blessing; the sequence plays beautifully with expressions, eyes, shadows, movements, all lovingly animated by masters. This charming, intermittently sad movie's short (63 minutes) running time is appropriate; extraneous characters and sub-plots are not needed. For a similar cartoon, even shorter at 7 minutes, see ""Feed the Kitty"" (1952)."
109,Dumbo,4,31 August 2016,There are better alternatives,"I know I'm in the minority with this, but I didn't like this movie. Aside from the animation and the mouse that helps Dumbo, the movie was either bland, sad, or just mean-spirited. I get the message the movie's trying to get across, ""It's not about what's on the outside, it's what's on the inside that counts."", but I've seen this same message given way better treatment. Cartoon shows have covered it, books have covered it, even songs have covered it. The movie as a whole feels like a rejected ""Fantasia"" piece. The score had me more engaged than the actual story, and the story itself just feels stretched to a little over 60 minutes. Heck, 99% of the characters in this movie don't even have names! Dumbo isn't all that interesting either, beings he doesn't have a word of dialogue, the only way to advance his character is to have other characters be mean to him. It makes me feels sorry for him, but also despise everyone that picks on him. The movie's full of these characters, and it made it frustrating to watch when they were on screen. The only thing I can really recommend seeing from this is ""Pink Elephants"", and it's mostly because it's so out of left field. At least the movie's short, other than that, the mouse, and a completely random acid trip that lasts three minutes, there's nothing that would make me revisit this."
110,Dumbo,7,20 June 2008,True classic,"A Disney ""classic"" that actually is a classic, Dumbo should be part of your video collection whether or not you have children. The storytelling was never as lean as in Dumbo, the songs rarely as haunting (or just plain weird), the characters rarely so well defined. The film pits the ""cold, cruel, heartless"" world that can't accept abnormality against a plucky, and mute, hero. Jumbo Jr. (Dumbo is a mean-spirited nickname) is ostracized from the circus pack shortly after his delivery by the stork because of his big ears. His mother sticks up for him and is shackled. He's jeered by children (an insightful scene has one boy poking fun at Dumbo's ears, even though the youngster's ears are also ungainly), used by the circus folk, and demoted to appearing with the clowns. Only the decent Timothy Q. Mouse looks out for the little guy. Concerns about the UN-PC ""Jim Crow"" crows, who mock Dumbo with the wonderful ""When I See an Elephant Fly,"" should be moderated by remembering that the crows are the only social group in the film who act kindly to the little outcast. If you don't mist up during the ""Baby Mine"" scene, you may be legally pronounced dead."
111,Dumbo,6,25 May 1999,Still an enjoyable film,"I just watched this film for the first time in quite a while this evening, and I must admit that it was better than I had remembered.  This is by no means as good as the recent Disney classics, but it moves at a surprisingly brisk pace, and contains a number of memorable scenes.  I was not impressed with the ""pink elephant"" sequence, and I found the crows to be generally incomprehensible, but these were really my only quibbles with the film. The ""Baby Mine"" is still a rather beautiful segment, but my favourite moment was watching all of the elephants stack on one another.  After all, it isn't every day that you see pachyderms balancing on each other!"
112,Dumbo,3,9 February 1999,Not suitable for children?,"Like Bambi, I saw this as a young child and was bothered by the movie. Rating movies I compare them to other movies in the same genre, and as a children's movie I would have to give this a ""3"". What could be more traumatizing to a young child, than the loss of one's mother? I, as a child, was not even aware of that possibilty until viewing of these movies. While life lessons should be learned, I don't think that this is necessarily the correct medium for that without some warning. Perhaps we need a NC-4 rating?"
113,Dumbo,6,27 February 2006,Watch Out for White Elephants,"About mid-way through this movie, the animators dropped acid and kept on working, and what resulted is a bizarre and truly frightening hallucination scene involving creepy white elephants and all other sorts of surrealist imagery. Thank God I didn't see this film when I was a kid or I would have been petrified of elephants for the rest of my life.Otherwise, this is pretty standard-issue Disney. Like many early Disney films, it's almost sadistic in its attempts to feed off of the emotional response provoked by separating a child from its mother. None of the songs or any other scenes are especially memorable, and there's nothing in the artistry to launch it into the same field as other early Disney films like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" or ""Pinocchio.""Grade: B"
114,Dumbo,6,18 September 2017,Cute,"I'd really give this 6.5/10 stars, but I often rate movies I really like (but still aren't amazing) 7 stars, so I'm not rounding it up. This movie I don't ""really like."" It's sweet and heartfelt, but not amazing (except for the animation), incredible, or something you're dying to watch. Flying elephant? What...? Even so, it's sweet and has that beautiful classic touch to it."
115,Dumbo,6,6 August 2017,Not as enduring a kids film as once thought,"Certainly a hit in its day, Walt Disney's ""Dumbo"" doesn't seem to be able to hold the young audiences some years into the 21st century. I watched this film recently with some grandchildren and the youngest ones were bored with the film before halfway into it. They soon lost interest and went off to cavort or do some other things. A teenage granddaughter stayed with it and said it was one of her favorite movies. There seems to be a difference in children brought up a mere 15 or so years apart. While kids have had cartoons and children's movies and TV since the beginning, those things have changed over time. Except for the bona fide learning TV programs (alphabets, numbers, etc.), most of the fare geared to young children even on TV and in the movies is of the fast-paced variety. Lots of action, comedy, excitement. So, the slower older films such as ""Dumbo"" soon become boring to modern-day children. In this case I have to side with the youngsters. Maybe it's because I knew the story and the outcome, but I too found this film very slow watching it these many years later. Perhaps some of the older films, especially the animated, once considered classics are just products of their time and not enduring masterpieces. I'm sure ""Dumbo"" will be around  as long as some semblance of the Disney operation exists. And, maybe future generations will prove its durability. But this little heads up, especially for seniors who may be grandpa and/or grandma sitting in the future. Have another film or other option ready in case you find the little ones restless and bored over this one."
116,Dumbo,10,4 July 2016,"Cheaper, Yes, but Still a Charmer","Box-Office Returns aside, it seems that Walt Disney Never Failed to Produce a Bonafide, Enduring, Universally Acclaimed Animated Feature. At least in in the Golden Years.""Dumbo"" was the Fourth Feature and is Today, as it was initially, Praised by Critics and Moviegoers of All Ages as a Name Your Superlative. When Viewed in the 21st Century it again Wows and Stimulates Audiences with its Classic Charm. The Story, Animation, Songs, and overall Greatness remains as Moderns Embrace the Precious Pachyderm as Their own Sweet, Special Child.In its One Hour Running Time, ""Dumbo"" Captivates with an Enormous amount of Emotion. There are Lessons Learned and Fun, Frolic, and Danger Under the Big Top. The many Highlights include...The Wisecracking and Tuneful Crows...Pink Elephants on Parade...Dumbo using His Disability to Advantage...and many More.Compared to other Disney Films from the Time Period when viewed Side by Side, it is evident that Costs were Cut. But the Profound Story, the Heartfelt Characterizations, and other Qualities allow ""Dumbo"" to Proudly Fly Alongside the more Expensive Disney Movies of its Era."
117,Dumbo,7,30 April 2016,"March forward, Tim Burton!","Dumbo, as dark as it got, would most certainly be the type of film to benefit from a Tim Burton re-imagining. Talking about the original, Baby Mine and Pink Elephants on Parade are the two best moments in my experience, but other than Mrs. Jumbo's outburst leading to her incarceration, that is about as memorable as it gets for this film. I can only vaguely remember the Crows and their motivational speech, or the awe that we experienced when Dumbo started flying like a jumbo jet. The characters are fairly forgettable, but the animation on them is exciting and even creative in terms of the pink elephant hallucinations. Upon hearing rumors that a live-action Dumbo was coming out within a few years, I realized that yes, Tim Burton could give some improvement to the characters and also give the visuals a boost. The original is well worth your time, though my expectations were only slightly exceeded."
118,Dumbo,6,28 February 2016,Dumbo Review,"Dumbo is one of Disney's ""classics"" and it's a movie that doesn't always work for me. I really like most of the scenes and the scenes that get to you emotionally. Every time Dumbo cries or when he visits his mother in the cage I really like. However it's a movie that doesn't have the best voice performances and the animation is mostly great but there are one or two scenes in which there are some inconsistencies, like there is a moment in which Dumbo's eyes are black. These are minor details, but the main issue I have with the film is the tone. It goes from being very happy and Disney like to very dark and sad and then at the end from sad to happy again. The tone of a movie, animated or not should always be defined within the first few minutes of the film and there are some major tonal inconsistencies here. Also, there are some weird stereotypes in the movie and I understand it was released in the 40's but it also feels weird. Like the workers of the circus who put up the circus tent are all black and the first words to come out of their mouths are something like ""We work all day, work all night."" I'm probably paraphrasing though. Also, the crows all play African- American stereotypes for some reason and it's just odd. Some of the songs are great though, especially the ""When I see an elephant fly"" song and the pink elephant sequence is great. The ending is kind of heart- warming too. I can find enjoyment in Dumbo despite its flaws, but I do believe it is a very inconsistent movie and probably gets more credit than it deserves, in my opinion."
119,Dumbo,7,27 August 2015,Effective at being emotional but sometimes insensitive,"The story of Dumbo (1941) is one of those classic films that most children do not go without seeing at an early age. At the time Disney was having financial troubles. Although Fantasia (1940) and Pinocchio (1940) were critically acclaimed, both failed to bring in a profit for the animation giant. Interestingly enough the screening of Dumbo (1941) did the exact opposite and even managed to be made during an animators' strike during the current time. Like a lot of the other Disney films, the iconic elephant would become apart of the library of assorted characters to represent the Disney company. The only thing that sets Dumbo apart from other Disney mascots is just how many people and fans remember him more than others. He probably comes 2nd or 3rd to Mickey. For this to stick that much there must have been something in the film to make it hang around so long in the conscious of the viewers.That something is what goes into this story's writing penned by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer. The story is about a newborn elephant with ears larger than normal being brought into the world by mother elephant Mrs. Jumbo. Yet with his ears being abnormally big, the name Dumbo ends up being his new name by the local snot nosed gossip circus elephants. Upon one show, locals begin to make fun of Dumbo, which enrages mom causing her to be separated from him. Feeling sad and alone, Dumbo befriends Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy) who sympathizes and wants to help him. There are two main components that work in the script. The first is the mother/son relationship between Dumbo and his mother. The other part is the life lesson of never stop believing in oneself and to never let others bring you down. Dumbo in some ways parallels that to an early version of WALL·E (2008); where the main character does not have much or if any dialog. This kind of writing isn't always effective because it's harder to portray emotions on a verbal level but that's not a problem here.Dumbo is one the sweetest little characters a viewer could watch. There is literally nothing to dislike about him. He's possibly even more innocent than Bambi (1942). Watching him interact with his mother is one of the sweetest moments in childhood history. It is this element that demonstrates how important a mother is in a child's life. As for Timothy Q. Mouse, he represents the self-preservation part about moving forward in life and not letting anyone stop you. If it were not for Timothy, who knows how long it would've taken Dumbo to get out of his slump of being mocked. Timothy is actually an underrated mouse icon and should be the second mouse to think of other than Mickey. However, even with these strong points there are some moments of question as to why they were even considered to be included. For these scenes, they involve the pink elephant sequence and racial representation.During a moment when Dumbo has the hiccups he accidentally takes a drink out of bucket that contains booze and gets loopy, which then induces him and the audience into a trippy sequence about pink elephants. From a particular viewpoint the scene does make sense, which is distracting us so we're thrown off guard when the scene ends, but from another point of view there really is no other significance. It's just a scene that gets a bit weird over time and may give some kids nightmares. As for racial representation Dumbo and Timothy meet a group of crows that are drawn and talk like African Americans at the time (as media had thought). For both situations it's understood that more adults viewed cartoons at the time and the way African Americans were portrayed in cartoons was much different, but both don't excuse for how that turns out now. Yes, it is all apart of history but it is still insensitive. Children nowadays watch this and could get the wrong idea. If these parts were managed in a less insulting way there'd be more to give slack on.For this movie there was no head of production. There were seven different directors for this feature; all of which handled different sequences. Nonetheless they all are directed as if it were one person. The animation headed by Art Babbitt was well crafted too. All the movement on each character and objects were fluid and smooth. For a Disney film like this, nothing but excellence is expected, otherwise it would not be considered among the memorable films. The music composed by Oliver Wallace and Frank Churchill was an addition to happily hear. There are several tracks that are recognizable and are catchy to listen to. The main theme for Dumbo is heroic and brave sounding with that classic mid 1900s sound of horn and string. Other tracks like the odd ""Pink Elephants"" and jumpy Casey Jr. train tune are catchy and memorable too. It's not perfect but it is still an enjoyable piece of film work.Unfortunately due to the time of its release, the film suffers from racial caricatures and adult content involving booze. It's not a huge anchor but it does feel insensitive. Thankfully the adorable main characters, effective writing, creative animation and memorable music help even things out."
120,Dumbo,7,11 April 2015,iconic Disney animation but needs a good villain,"The stoke delivers a baby elephant to Mrs. Jumbo. The other elephants ridicule his big ears and call him Dumbo. When the kids at the fair start picking on him, Mrs. Jumbo fight back. She's locked up. Timothy Q. Mouse becomes Dumbo's only friend. When Dumbo causes a great crash, he's shamefully relegated to the clowns. He and Mouse accidentally get drunk and hallucinates Pink Elephants on Parade. They wake up in a tree with the crows. Dumbo learns to fly at first with the help of a 'magic' feather. He becomes a big star and is reunited with his mother. The animation has a simple beauty of a children's book. The plot is a bit thin. It's missing a true villain. Dumbo has to achieve only one thing if the plot is strip down. He learns to fly and that's just about it. The separation from his mother is heart breaking. If a villain could be created to cause that separation, I think the movie would be that much better. If there is a villain, Dumbo could have some drama overcoming him."
121,Dumbo,8,5 October 2012,"Well, haters gonna hate","The title does not mean I HATE this movie. I love it and I find it cute, but you learn from this film that even if you are the cutest elephant ever, there will always be someone (or many in this case) that despise you. This movie sets a good example for the ""haters gonna hate"" saying. It teaches you that you can always prove them wrong no matter what flaw you have or if you are constantly bullied. This movie has one of the best meanings out of any movie and I can see why so many people can relate to the pain that Dumbo went through, just because he has those giant ears.The only thing that I do not like about this movie is the timing. I do not want to watch a 64 minute movie with such an amazing message. And the flying sequence should be a lot longer and become a part of the central conflict which is the ""haters gonna hate"" thing. Also, those crows are badly portrayed and the voice overs were horrible. These are my cons for Dumbo.Dumbo is a really good film. I wish it was longer than 64 minutes, but otherwise, a fantastic job by the great Walt Disney!"
122,Dumbo,,29 August 2011,An underrated classic,"I watched Dumbo after having watched Pinocchio and I thought Dumbo was the better film by far. The animation is a lot more simplistic but it works wonders for the story. The characters are lovable. I especially loved Disney's decision to make Dumbo a silent character. Adding Timothy Mouse for the talking was a clever touch. ""Baby Mine"" is heartbreaking and I was nearly in tears. I can hardly believe Dumbo was a cheaper film to make. Sure it's shorter than the others but I've found that shorter movies are just as good, sometimes better, than longer ones. The only issue I had with Dumbo was the abrupt ending. He learned to fly and then it was over. But even that all wraps up nicely.People don't usually pay much attention to Dumbo but I think they should. It's a sweet film which would never have been made nowadays. It's a darn shame, too. Children can learn a lot about not judging others by the way they look."
123,Dumbo,7,13 May 2011,"Not bad, although it lacked stuff","I love Disney movies. I loved all the princess films. I loved the Mickey Mouse stuff. I love Disney.Now, this movie has been with many people's hearts, although now that I've seen it, I'm not certain WHY. I always try to think positive about each film, however this one seemed to lack stuff.The story was basic, it was okay. The characters were fine. But the emotional connected just didn't seem to be there. I was happy with the ending, although it just seemed to end too soon. There wasn't enough of a trial to make it worthwhile.But all in all, it's still a classic I will take to heart."
124,Dumbo,10,13 December 2009,An unrivaled gem,"It is interesting to see established attitudes haunt some of the old Disney movies. In the case of Dumbo, it is far better to have someone speak of it as ""dark"" than to hear the moniker ""dated"".The critique of ""dark"" can be one of the hugest compliments an animated film can receive, because you can judge by that its amount of cowardice in presenting the human (or animal, if you like) predicament, as compared with standard children's fare. But it is an inaccurate label for Dumbo, which has one of the most optimistic endings on record.The fact is, the dark makes the light more beautiful, more triumphant, and more moving. The dark is the true rendering of obstacles in the path of the hero, and Dumbo is perhaps the greatest animated hero ever. If you saw Dumbo's amount of ""darkness"" presented in a live- action film, you would complain that it was insubstantial fluff, that it blows off into the wind, never to be seen again.Dumbo will never blow off into the wind. It is on a straight course through the history of the best, most dramatic, and most inventive cartoon features ever."
125,Dumbo,10,10 October 2007,"Over-sized Pachyderm Sound Sensory Organs Prove up to the Task of Creating Sustained Lift & Drag, acting like the Upper Limbs of Avian Cousins!","At our house, years ago while this writer was one of 5 young Ryan Kids on Damen Avenue, a virtual Holiday in our House whenever there was a Walt Disney animated film released, be it new, or especially a Classic Re-release. There was always great anticipation from the day we received the Great News, until the Great Day(usually Saturday or Sunday Matinée, of course).At first, our Older Sister, Joanne (1942-1990), was in charge of any family excursions, our folks would pass on the chance and $ave a few Buck$ in the same day. (With 7 mouths to feed in the house, every little bit helped!) We had already seen PINNOCHIO, BAMBI, Cinderella, SNOW WHITE, THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW and THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS, when DUMBO came up in the rotation. It was an instant success, being a good example of a Walt Disney Animated film. And, yet it stood alone, having a certain unique feel all of its own.The story, based on a kid's book, DUMBO THE FLYING ELEPHANT by one Helen Aberson, was bright, quick moving and a delight. There is not a scene, nor even a frame of exposed, animated film that doesn't help in propelling the story forward from beginning to the Fairy Tale-like Happy Ending.It has been said that Mr. Disney did this DUMBO as a feature in order to offset some of the production co$t$ that were incurred with the costly SNOW WHITE, PINNOCHIO and (especially)the ""Concert Feature"", FANTASIA. Accordingly, more expensive techniques, such as the use of the 3 Dimensional Effects of the Multi-Plain Camera, would be held to a minimum. It would seem to have the tendency to give the finished product a ""cheap"" look. Quite to the contrary, the rich color work and lively animation work, it is really not noticed in its little over one hour running time. (64 minutes, to be exact.) And when these more elaborate processes were applied, the result is outstanding and even to the point of contending to be called the finest example of this Multi-Plained Camera effect. Take for example the fine aerial scenes of our little Elephant with the Crows. Certainly the nocturnal view of the star-studded sky full of countless 'twinklers',is unmatched in any other film. That sky that we view when little Dumbo is taken by Timothy Mouse to visit his shackled, caged Mother must be ranked as a high-point in Animation History.Of all the elements that go into animated sound film, the first to be considered have to be the ""Voices""; the actors who will give life, personalities and that all important Anthropomorphism to the animal characters. Contrary to a commonly held misconception, it is the dialog comes first, not the action.* In DUMBO, the Disney Production team provided us with as fine an array of actors to voice our story.The cast of characters follows, with no one given as DUMBO's voice, as the little Pachyderm did not speak, giving him the distinction of being the one and only Disney main character to be mute throughout his film.(Dumbo's Mother, Mrs. Jumbo, says only one line. In telling the Stork the Baby's name she says, ""Jumbo, Jr."".) So we begin with veteran comic relief man, Ed Brophy, who gave Timothy Mouse a sort of ""street tough"" Brooklynese accent. High pitched and smooth voiced Sterling Holloway does the 'delivery man', Mr. Stork, leading the other Elephants in ""Happy Birthday to You"". Verna Felton gives the cattiest of personalities to the lead female, the Elephant Matriarch. Herman Bing lends his very German accent to the Ring Master.** And 'Ukelele Ike'(Himself), Cliff Edwards, provided the vocals, both talking and singing, for Jim Crow, the Leader of the Negro Charicatured band of Crows.(more about that later) The rest of the cast is filled out by the following: Deep Voiced (former BIG BAD WOLF)Billy Bletcher, Jim Carmichael, Noreen Gammill, Eddie Holden, Malcolm Hutton, Harold Manley, Tony Neill, Dorothy Scott, Sarah Selby, Billy sheets, Chuck Stubbs, Margaret Wright, with Hall Johnson & The Hall Johnson Choir;and featuring the Narration of John McLeish.The use of the band of happy-go-lucky Crows portrayed as Negroes, may be a little out of line with what is considered to be proper or ""Politically Correct"" in today's world. But, alas, the whole sequence is done in fun and without any insult intended. And it is with the aid of the Crows, that Timothy is able to convince Dumbo that his big ears are able to be flapped repeatedly to create the lift and drag proportions needed for a sustained take-off and flight.As for emotions, like all Disneys, DUMBO certainly ""hits for the cycle.""*** We experience Joy of his ""Late"" Arrival/Birth, the dismay and disgust at his ridicule and rejection by the Elephants, and the shock, alarm and sheer horror at his Mother's being Chained and solitarily confined. The shame of being relegated to a member of ""Clown Alley"".But we experience the joy, jubilation and tears of a triumphant laughter when the former ""Clown"" proves his talents and stands vindicated, triumphant and hailed as a World Famous Hero.NOTE: * An Animated Cartoon in which the sound, both dialog, music and sound effects are added after the filming, is known as being ""Post Synchronized"", of which Disney's STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928)was one.NOTE:** I had thought that it was the voice of Sig Ruman. But it doesn't disappoint. Either Sig or the above mentioned Herman Bing had the proper Germanic Accent and tones to get the job done correctly.NOTE:*** ""Hitting For The Cycle"" is a Baseball term for a single batter's hitting a single, a double, a triple and a home run, all in one game."
126,Dumbo,9,27 June 2006,Dumbo is the best Disney animation,"Dumbo is a masterpiece, a timeless classic. I watched Dumbo as a child, it was easily my favorite Disney movie. Pink elephants, circus acts, singing scarecrows, it is truly a memorable piece of work.If only Disney would have been socially and racially conscious enough to portray the black crows in an acceptable manner would it have been the perfect animation. The black crows are portrayed as lazy, comical, and entertaining. One may also note the substandard English grammar used by the crows. The black crows, unfortunately, were an obvious depiction of black men at the time the movie was created. The film was created in the 1940's, a period during American history in which no one could escape the hideous face of racism. Creations such as this aide in negatively shaping the image of a race of people and their culture. Individuals may inherently begin to form subconscious perceptions based on ideas and images depicted in such innocent childhood films as Dumbo."
127,Dumbo,9,14 January 2004,Disney classic with few flaws,"Short, simple story of a baby elephant and his triumph over physical awkwardness. The animation is never lacking, especially in the pink elephant scene. The only thing that prevents Dumbo from being a masterpiece is some of the padding done to the story, which is inexcusable for a feature this short. Not on the same level as Disney's first three features, but much better than its current crop.   4/5"
128,Dumbo,10,9 July 2003,Dumbo **** out of ****,"Walt Disney's favorite film of his is also my favorite film of his. It's a touching poignant tale of an outcast, who ends up a hero to the audience even though neither he nor his mother utter a word in the entire film. The silence just adds to the beauty and makes it even easier for us to relate to it. Deep down the movie is a tale about the love between a mother and her child. The film is not only touching, it is also hilarious and has great songs, especially ""Baby Mine"". The dancing elephant dance is groundbreaking."
129,Dumbo,10,14 February 2003,Best Mother-Daughter Disney Movie,"DUMBO""Dumbo"" was one of the few Disney that made me cry. When the mother takes Dumbo and they start to cry and sing ""baby mine don't you cry..."" ::sniff::. Dumbo was a cute, adorable little elephant with big ears who everyone teased and no one appreciated. It's one of my favorite child hood movies and one of the best Disney movies.
I give it ***** stars out of *****."
130,Dumbo,9,22 November 2002,Love That Elephant,"10/10.  This is a great one, from the pink elephants to the crows.  And I do love those crows.  They really make the difference in Dumbo's life.  At first they just kid around with him, but then they genuinely wish to help him out.  And the scene with Dumbo and his mother with the song ""Baby Mine"" playing...  If that doesn't get you teary-eyed then nothing will.  This is one of the first ones and one of the best ones.  It just goes to show you that you don't need fancy modern animation to make a darn good animated movie.  Way to go, Walt."
131,Dumbo,,12 October 2002,The Best Disney Movie Ever,"What's great about this movie, and what many people may not see, is that Dumbo learns to overcome his ""handicap"" ears by learning that he can fly. Sure, everybody from the crows to the other elephants make fun of him, but Timothy Mouse sees beyond his ears and becomes his only friend. Some may see this movie as a bit cruel, but if you think about it, isn't that how life is?  This movie shows how taunting and making fun of someone just because they are different can be a hurtful thing.  And even though Dumbo doesn't talk at all, the tears and his expressions show just how broken his heart is.  I think this movie would be a great way to teach a child how not to treat someone just because they are a little different.Also the heart-wrenching scene where Dumbo meets up with his shackled Mom will make you bawl like a child."
132,Dumbo,10,15 December 2001,Best Movie Ever!!,"I'm 13 now,and I remember seeing Dumbo once when I was really little,I never watched it that often.When I was in fourth grade we had to do a report on an animal and I chose an elephant...and soon fell in love with elephants.I never remember seeing Dumbo Or acknowledging it until there were commercials on saying it was Dumbos 60th anniversary. I then fell in love with Dumbo just by downloading and listening to the song Baby Mine...it truly touched me.And seeing clips of the movie online are amazing.I don't own the movie at the moment but i'm soon to get it.Dumbo is by far the best Disney character there is.I'm the kind of person that likes action packed bloody movies...but I do have a soft side too...when it comes to Dumbo.Theres a wonderful moral in the movie.Anyone that hates that movies or disses it is wrong it's one of the best movies out there!It shows that when you ridicule someone or something they'll come out strong and show you looks(in this case big ears) don't mean anything..So go out and get this movie and watch it!! its a good movie and has a good story to it. Rating out of ten-11 *~*Amy*~*"
133,Dumbo,10,28 June 2001,What an unusual sight!,"This classic movie has what most modern Disney flix have been missing--characters getting drunk and hallucinating.  ""Pink Elephants"" is easily the best musical sequence in any of Disney's animated movies, except Fantasia.  Hell, Pink Elephants is good enough to have been in Fantasia--kinetic movie-making, years before it's time!  The most clever bit is the elephants circling around the screen--just imagine what that would have been like in a movie theater!Beyond that sequence, the movie is animated more like Disney's earlier short films than Snow White or Pinocchio in that it is highly stylistic and caricatured, but that really works for Dumbo.  You have Casey Junior the train making noises that amount to talking (the raspy parody of ""The Little Engine that Could"" was terrific), and of course Dumbo with those big ears. It's fantastically off-the-wall, for the most part.Like most Disney films, Dumbo has a heart--this one dedicated to mothers and ""f-r-e-a-k-s"" (the only time that I am aware of that a Disney movie uses that word) who are treated with disrespect by snickering, gossiping people of a ""proud race.""  It seems that the crows (metaphorically African Americans) near the end are supposed to be lumped together with Dumbo as a mistreated group, but I'm not sure.The other great sequence is the tent building, which rivals the igloo scene in Nanook of the North (and probably inspired by it).Dumbo is definitely a 10/10, despite (or because) of it's short length."
134,Dumbo,,26 April 2000,Disney classic,"Mrs. Jumbo wants a baby, and the stork brings her one. But the elephant baby has very big ears.It is named Dumbo. Everybody laughs at Dumbo. Dumbo's only friend is a little mouse. Dumbo is  a Disney classic from 1941.The movie has many memorable moments like the circus scenes and the pink elephants. Dumbo is great fun for children and adults to watch. The magic of Dumbo hasn't died, and it has been almost 60 years."
