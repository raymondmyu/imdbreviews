0,Belladonna of Sadness,9,27 April 2003,"splendid visuals, anticipating Miyazaki. Disney it ain't!","Loosely based on the nineteenth-century classic ""The Witch"" by historian Jules Michelet, ""Belladonna"" tells the story of a young ""everywoman"" in a brutally repressive and exploitative feudal society; in her powerlessness she is gradually driven to ancient superstitions and satanic practices, and then accused, tortured and executed for witchcraft. This storyline provides for a pageantry of sado-erotic scenes. ""Belladonna"" hovers uncomfortably on the edge of pornography but the film is saved, and viewer bewitched, by the incredible wealth of imaginative visual flourishes. Yamamoto's style in this medieval story hovers between classical Japanese landscape painting and twentieth-century underground comics (western style and manga), conjuring up, with accomplished technique, his dark fantasies. Think of Disney's Fantasia, but with more visual variation of style, and dedicated to the themes of lust and cruelty. ""Belladonna"" is a very early masterpiece of Japanese anime, anticipating Miyazaki by more than two decades."
1,Belladonna of Sadness,8,18 February 2008,Belladonna of Sadness was the product of an animation studio that knew it was doomed.,"""It becomes apparent early on when viewing Belladonna of Sadness that this film is quite unique. Certainly the first, and possibly the only animated film that might be classified in the pinku genre. But even though the film is supposedly animated, nothing seems to be moving at first. You instead see a series of elegantly designed still drawings depicting a harmonious wedding between a peasant couple in 14th century France, as a woman sings her narration in the soulful style of a 70s rock opera. This is the film's only joyous scene, as moments later the new groom is pleading with the local land baron to reduce the marriage tax he can't afford. The baron instead decides to exercise his ""droit de seigneur"" with the bride. It is here, several minutes into the film, that full animation is finally used, in order to depict the rape of the virgin bride with metaphorical imagery much more disturbing than what a literal depiction of the same events could provide. A sign of things to come, as this is only the first in a series of tragic events that push this woman, through desperation, into the world of witchcraft."" ..."
2,Belladonna of Sadness,,20 March 2016,A highly underrated and experimental adult art film with a lasting impact.,"Background:Kanashimi no Belladonna, literally translated as 'Belladonna of Sadness' or figuratively as 'The Tragedy of Belladonna' is an avant- garde feature film produced by Mushi Production and directed/co- written by Eiichi Yamamoto in 1973. It was loosely inspired by the 1862 book La Sorcière (Satanism and Witchcraft) by French historian Jules Michelet. It's also the third and final installment in the Animerama trilogy conceived by manga god Osamu Tezuka, but is the only one that was neither written nor directed by him.This isn't your typical anime by any stretch of the imagination. The rating is listed as Rx, but rest assured it isn't intended to induce erotic pleasure in any way, shape or form. It's a dark and twisted experimental sequence of art and storytelling that should be treated no less.Story:Belladonna of Sadness tells the tragedy of the beautiful peasant woman Jeanne who was raped by the land baron of her village on her wedding night after the couple failed to meet marriage taxes. Spurned by her husband, she decided to make a pact with the devil to gain wealth and power, but not without facing certain consequences. Jeanne becomes a suspect of witchcraft, and is subsequently banished from her village by the baron.However, with the village quickly becoming swallowed by the cusp of the bubonic plague the baron is forced to change his heart. He summons Jeanne back and offers her the rank of highest noble in return for her to rescue them from despair with the mysterious flower she possessed. Regardless, Jeanne's motives were altered by her painful experiences, and she refused to accept such an offer.. which ultimately leads to her fate and the pinnacle of the film.The final scene ends with an image of Eugène Delacroix's 'La Liberté guidant le people.' The painting features a female personification of liberty itself, leading a mixture of social classes during the French Revolution. In the film Jeanne finds herself in a similar position, and her impact on society can be compared with that of Joan of Arc, Salem witch trials, and several prominent women in history.This story is depicted rather well throughout the duration of the film and is often told metaphorically with symbolism rather than figuratively with speech. The nature of it is widely subjective, but certainly compelling nonetheless. I believe it's most rewarding with an open mind.Characters:The characters aren't a strong aspect of the film. The only truly memorable character is Jeanne, but like the others she lacks any real development. This doesn't hinder the experience in the end, because the characters were never really intended to be a centerfold. They merely exist as a route of administration for the lessons and morals lurking in the shadows of the film. Jeanne's character in particular appears to represent feminism, and relates to a myriad of prominent women throughout history. Especially when considering her comparison with Jeanne d'Arc (Joan of Arc). Michelet's book La Sorcier which inspired Belladonna of Sadness arguably depicts the story of Joan of Arc, and portrays her resistance against feudalism and the Catholic Church. The similarities with Jeanne can be seen most in the final scenes of the film.Art:The visuals are reminiscent of watercolor paintings and heavily influenced by western art. It often hangs in limbo between realism and surrealism, and surely isn't considered typical. The quality is fair considering it was produced in the 70s. It's also pending the release of a 4k restoration that will greatly enhance the clarity and colors.Animation:The animation suffers greatly where the art shines. Many of the scenes are depicted by panning across still paintings rather than being animated. This could be seen as a matter of style or budget, but it definitely could've benefited from consistency. Regardless, I think the animation can be forgiven considering the era it was produced.Sound:The music is as funky as the era it came from and varies greatly from the Rock Opera to Psychedelic genre and beyond. It's almost always fitting, and creates indescribable emotions that go hand in hand with the images on screen.Overall:A belladonna is a highly toxic flower, which also stands for 'beautiful woman.' In the past, witches were believed to use a mixture of belladonna and other plants in flying ointment, which they applied to help them fly to gatherings with other witches. A theory for the inclusion of belladonna in flying ointments concerns the dream-like waking state it produces.Much of the scenes in the film are depicted as if the viewer was under the influence of the belladonna flower. Similar to the flower, the film itself can also be interpreted from many different perspectives. In my eyes Belladonna of Sadness holds significant implications regarding sexuality, feminism, religion, and history. It presents a thought provoking succession of metaphorical imagery far ahead of its time, and I won't ever forget the impact it had on me."
3,Belladonna of Sadness,10,26 June 2016,Visually and aurally incredible piece of cinematic art,"Wow. Sometimes something comes along that really genuinely blows me away and the viewing of this movie is one such very rare occasion. It's a film that was released in 1973 in an era when the adult cartoon was a new concept, typified by the likes of Fritz the Cat (1972), but Belladonna of Sadness by contrast attracted mainly negative criticism and it then seemed to more or less fall off the radar for many, many years. Having just seen it I can only say that this is a criminal state of affairs and that it is pretty seriously unfortunate, to say the least, that something so overwhelmingly artistically beautiful was disregarded and cast aside. The amount of artistic imagination and creativity on display here is pretty monumental.Its regarded as a very early example of Japanese anime but it's like no other anime I have ever seen. While it definitely does have some material that would go on to be associated with the manga branch of Japanese anime, it is executed in a somewhat experimental manner. This is quite honestly more of an art film than an actual story. Many folks seem to have taken all manner of things away from this one in terms of its content, such as a feminist message and such. And while I agree that this is there, the sheer beauty of the artistry is so overwhelming that the contents of the story were completely overshadowed by the visceral sensory experience of watching this one. Despite its Japanese origins this one is set in the Middle Ages in Europe and it begins with a wedding of a young couple. The groom cannot pay the marriage tax so the baron exercises his 'rights' and rapes the bride. This trauma deeply affects the young couple and the woman turns to witchcraft.Some may be taken aback by certain aspects of this one. Firstly, despite being an animated work, much of the story is told by still paintings and drawings. There are many elaborately detailed tableaux which the camera pans across and in so doing expands upon the narrative. There are many still pieces of art of varying styles, such as landscape watercolours, comic-book style figures and surrealism. These visual ideas are interwoven with early 70's styles such as psychedelia and transgressive underground comics. There are animated sections too, which make even more impact because they only appear every so often. There seems to be a general split where the narrative is depicted using stills and the inner working of the protagonists mind are animated. Consequently, this leads to the extended animated sequences being more dreamlike and surreal in nature. Accentuating all of this is an excellent soundtrack which works fantastically well with the imagery on screen. It's quite an eclectic score which features what could best be described as Japanese folk-pop and some out-and-out prog-rock.As I said before, this isn't a film for everybody. Aside from its experimental approach, some may find the sexual content difficult. There are many examples of sexual imagery, although I wouldn't say it's exactly in erotic territory on account of its highly stylised presentation but also due to the disturbing nature of much of it. But despite the dark undercurrents to the material this is a film of enormous visual and aural beauty. In my personal opinion this has to go down as a stonewall classic and a great example of what the animated movie format is capable of."
4,Belladonna of Sadness,8,21 March 2017,Impressive work of art,"Impressive work of art. The back cover of the Blu-ray states that this is the last film in the Animerama trilogy. In doing a little research I found that Animerama is defined as ""...a series of thematically- related adult anime feature films originally conceived and initiated by Osamu Tezuka..."" This third film was co-written and directed by Eiichi Yamamoto inspired by the book SATANISM AND WITCHCRAFT by Jules Michelet.The animation is fairly basic. It's largely comprised of long paintings, done in watercolor. The effect reminds me of certain Japanese scrolls where, as they unwind, the story is told. In the case of this film, however, the camera slowly moves right to left along the painting, occasionally zooming in. There is also other limited use of cell animation where the camera is shooting each of the different cells and they are presented in sequence on film to show progression/movement...at a lower slower frame rate than, say, the average Disney cell animation. As mentioned, it's all fairly basic and yet still works well in combination with the other elements. Which are:Narration, requiring reading of subtitles for those not fluent in Japanese.And a great sound/music score that I wouldn't mind having on CD. It ranges from trippy to hauntingly beautiful with a few actual songs that are quite nice. And other chaotic or horrific or beautiful sounds and music. All complementing the imagery in a way that is very important to this type of animated film.Who would I recommend this to. It deals with some pretty strong subject matter, not the least of which is rape. Horror fans may appreciate some of the darker aspects of the film. But beyond that: Do you appreciate art? Do you appreciate Japanese culture/history? Are you open to alternative forms of storytelling? If you answer yes to all then you will probably like this film. I thought it was one of those rare treats that I likely will revisit. I'm also now curious about the other two films in the Animerama trilogy."
5,Belladonna of Sadness,10,3 June 2016,"A Masterpiece, but not for everybody","This film is a masterpiece. There are very few animation films that cross the territory into high art, but this is one. Calling it anime is kind of a disservice as it is more rooted in animated art films than it is anime. This may be Japans first animated masterpiece. But it was not done in a style many of us understand to be anime. It is deeply surrealistic in both imagery and approach. While some scenes are not animated, but rather hand painted still frames which are panned and edited together, but this never detracts from the overall context of the film. The animation itself is a blend of styles throughout the film, but the heavy use of watercolor lends well to the new 4K restored version. This is a very adult film. It is highly sexual in nature. As an art film though from this era, it is actually not out of bounds. With that being said, art films, especially foreign ones, are not for everybody. This is a feminist film, but it may be a difficult film to watch for some. So a bit of a trigger warning for those who care. The themes do deal deeply with sexual trauma and violence, and recovering from it. It is also though about finding independence in a patriarchal system, and ownership of ones own sexuality. So beyond all that, if you do want to experience something different and beautiful, this film is something to behold. Everything from the great psychedelic rock, and free jazz soundtrack, to the mix of animation and artistic styles, we have a film that stands out even to this day. It is unique in what it offers. It's restoration should be celebrated. On a side note, I have to credit AFI Silver in Silver Spring, MD for screening this film. It remains one of the best cinema's in the country as otherwise forgotten films find new audiences. This really has not been screened much in the US. My hope is this does make it to blu-ray or some other media format. For now the credit is to the new distributors, but also arts cinemas like AFI Silver that are currently screening the film. It is a rare treat to see a film like this."
6,Belladonna of Sadness,5,1 June 2017,Drawing a line (and then some),"As another reviewer stated, calling this an Anime would probably set false expectations to this movie. Calling it an art animated film on the other hand is exactly the right description for it. And it is visually stunning and more often than not irritating. It may be telling a story, but it also messed with your head optically.This is very adult, but not in the way some may think. Or not as explicit as some may think this would be. This is clearly about sexuality, about discovering oneself, about boundaries, about liberation of ones own sexual nature and freedom, especially from a woman's point of view. To say you have to be open minded would be an understatement ... a very big one. But if you let yourself onto this ride ... well you'll discover things I reckon ..."
7,Belladonna of Sadness,4,11 March 2017,Too heavy on the immature male fantasy,"This film has several things that made it of interest to me: stylish Japanese animation, a story containing a deal with the devil (I'm always a sucker for movies featuring the devil, don't ask me why), and a director who was certainly not shy about showing nudity and sex (ok, I'm probably a sucker for those too, if they're done right anyway). Unfortunately, the movie doesn't live up to its potential, or perhaps, hasn't aged well. While some of the artwork is beautiful, the plot is simple, plodding along during slow right-to- left pans, and far too often using sex as a crutch. We see the devil having sex with the woman several times, lots of phallic imagery and big boobs, and a bizarre, surreal orgy in the woods featuring people, animals, and half-people/half-animals. It just gets to be a little much, and is definitely written/conceived/drawn from an immature male perspective. It's a shame that such a weighty theme and Faustian premise was so poorly handled. I also have to say that the scenes in France at the end are ridiculous, almost as if someone had an incoherent thought while high. Maybe if you were drunk or on an acid trip watching this film in college with your guy buddies in the 70's or 80's, you would love it. Otherwise, you can enjoy it for a window into what feels like 1960's psychedelia, some of its pretty animation (particularly in the first part of the film), and for it presumably having pushed boundaries in Japan at the time."
8,Belladonna of Sadness,6,30 November 2014,"Underwhelming, But Unique","When I started the film, I was lured in by its bleak narrative and erotic imagery. If it weren't for the language, Belladonna would be unrecognizable as anime, with its realistic proportions, faded colors, sexual themes, and psychedelic imagery/soundtrack. I quickly emphasized with our lead's suffering, and the allure of Satan himself when all joy and hope is dead.Unfortunately, while the initial premise was fascinating and sensual, Belladonna lacks the depth to make it a masterpiece. There is no real development. There are no likable characters. Jean doesn't ascend from her demons. Her downfall isn't particularly evocative. Its half emotional torture porn, half stoner fuel.The animation is also kind of bad. Heck, most of the time, you're only given stills. Some shots are beautiful, but others seem very cheap. Others are nonsensical, immature pieces of graffiti that somehow snuck into an art film.Belladonna seems disjointed between two opposite demographics and isn't good enough for either one. I wish someone could do this story better justice. But it was an interesting movie, especially for its time. Because of a few scenes and overall unique place in animation, I'd recommend it to those who are into more ""art house"" film. I wouldn't to those who want strong character and narrative."
9,Belladonna of Sadness,4,23 November 2017,There is probably no movie out there more confounding or trippy than this,"This was yet another one of my brother's gift films, and we spent the previous night watching it. With a name like Belladonna of Sadness, I was expecting something romantic, but I had no idea that I was about to watch a movie that genuinely infuriated me. This is why.Packed into its 86 minutes of run time, the plot here isn't always followed, but instead gives way for significant amounts of filler scenes that are only there to depict weird things that would be best for me to not mention on IMDb. Only some of these gory or erotic scenes are pertinent to the actual story surrounding Jeanne, but even then they are way too exaggerated and most of them feel pointless. Maybe I have poor taste as a film critic in movies like this, but this movie brings up significantly more questions than it answers. The characters are a similar mess, with a bunch of questionable things being done by Jeanne and, unsurprisingly, Satan himself. Some of these actions, such as a good amount of what Jeanne does to the village, contribute to this movie's borderline over-saturation of filler material. The music is probably the best thing about this movie, as it does complement each filler scene well. It's not as good as the music in some other movies, but it's probably the one thing about this movie I can safely praise. I can commend the animation for using a different style than most Japanese animation, but it's shockingly inconsistent; I counted 5 distinct styles of animation, with 4 of them being used for the filler. It depicts things that could have worked if it had more context (as in, relevant to the plot), but since it doesn't, its only purpose is just showing us the imagery. Personally, I dislike such choices by the crew. As good an idea it is for animation to invoke more than one style in a movie, it was not done properly here. At the very least, its animation stands out, and that alone gives this movie slightly more credit. Maybe I'm too simple to understand anything this movie said, but most of this film just took my brain and drowned it in boiling oil. I can't guarantee that you will enjoy this film even if you enjoy erotic or psychedelic material, let alone animation in the first place. Think of this film as the slightly exorcised love child of anything by Unearthed Films (the psychedelic and erotic imagery) and Plumbers Don't Wear Ties (most of the film, especially the portions fitting the plot, is just a slideshow with voices over it). Like those two, this is not something I can recommend to the common viewer. Oh, and if you suffer from seizures, avoid this film completely. There are two scenes that go way too overboard with multi-colored strobes."
10,Belladonna of Sadness,1,14 October 2006,"Three colours: Pretentious, Tasteless, Boring","Going by the amount of formalist peacockery, one can guess this was meant to be seen as some kind of serious stuff, a 'masterpiece' perhaps. Well, that doesn't exactly work out. I don't mind eclecticism if justified and done smartly, but this is definitely not the case. Here we have a big mess of stylistic incoherency, no more, no less. Annoying as it is, it still can't detract attention from an even more repulsive aspect: an ever conspicuous, moronic interest in seeing a naked woman (you know, tits and crotch and all) raped or otherwise humiliated. The peasantwoman in question lives in the Middle Ages, sports manicured nails and a general Yves Saint-Laurent sketchbook look. Her clothes always desintegrating, she is constantly abused by fallic entities. When for whatever reason she is crucified and burned, even the smoke of the stake pushes itself between her thighs. The story is just a pretext for such 'subtleties' throughout, so it's all the more gross when in the end-sequence the tit-owner martyr turns into Marianne of the French Revolution, leading the people towards Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. Sorry... what?! Since when being 'psychedelic' is an excuse for being cretinous? The barnstormer voice-acting and schmaltzy music (""Beradonna... Beradonna..."" - moans ad infinitum a nerve-racking karaoke singer) add more unpleasantry to this charmless trainwreck.P.S. I'm aware there may be legions of immature people out there, fed on visual hamburgers & pornography & all things Japanese, who may find this crap ""different"" and ""interesting"". All my sympathy for them."
11,Belladonna of Sadness,7,7 April 2017,An Epic Fantasy of Rape and Penises,"I'm not going to lie to you: This is a rapey cartoon. And, I use the word ""cartoon"" loosely. We all know how much the Japanese like their rape, so it is hardly surprising. Even the penis imagery mostly exhibited by Satan is something we've come to expect from the craziest island in Asia. So, why did I give it a seven? There are a lot of good aspects to this film. The imagery, although barely animated, is very imaginative and at times stunning. The story flows nicely. The voices and narration are well-done.The animation style reminds me a lot of the movie Wizards.The ending was weak... really weak..."
