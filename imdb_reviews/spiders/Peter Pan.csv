0,Peter Pan,10,23 November 2003,Definitely one of Disney's best films,"Peter Pan is one of my all time favorite animated films, this is just such a great classic that doesn't get enough notice. This is one of those movies that is so memorable and I'm surprised that honestly this movie isn't in the top 250. Captain Hook is one of my favorite Disney villains if not my number one, he's just plain hilarious and great entertainment. It's odd that I voted more for him and his pirates, just that they seemed like they were the group that you would invite to a party. Watching this movie for so many years, since I was a child, the story still hasn't lost it's touch. It's such a wonderful movie that not only the family could get into, but even I'll just watch it on my own if I want a cute movie. This is one of the best Disney movies of all time and the story of Peter Pan is told so wonderful you can't help but fall in love with it as well.In London, George and Mary Darling's preparations to attend a party are disrupted by the antics of the boys John and Michael, acting out a story about Peter Pan and the pirates, told to them by their older sister Wendy. The father angrily declares that Wendy has gotten too old to continue staying in the nursery with them, and it's time for her to grow up. That night they are visited in the nursery by a pixie named Tinker Bell and cocky Peter Pan, who teaches them to fly and takes them with him to the island of Never Land. A ship of pirates is anchored off Never Land, commanded by Captain Hook with his sidekick Mr Smee. Hook boldly plots to take revenge upon Peter Pan for cutting off his hand, but he trembles when the crocodile that ate it arrives. The crew's restlessness is interrupted by the arrival of Peter and the Darlings. The children easily evade them, and despite a trick by jealous Tinker Bell to have Wendy killed, they meet up with the Lost Boys, six lads in animal-costume pajamas who look to Peter as their leader. John and Michael set off with the Lost Boys to find the island's Indians, who instead capture them, believing them responsible for taking the chief's daughter Tiger Lily. Meanwhile, Peter takes Wendy to see the mermaids, where they see that Hook and Smee have captured Tiger Lily, to coerce her into revealing Peter's hideout. Peter and Wendy free her, and Peter is honored by the tribe. Hook then plots to take advantage of Tink's jealousy of Wendy, tricking her into revealing the location of Peter's lair. The pirates lie in wait and capture the Lost Boys and the Darlings as they exit, leaving behind a time bomb to kill Peter. I'm always going to love Peter Pan, my sister and I still have so much fun with this movie, we constantly rehearse the scene of George, the father, screaming about how the family loves the dog more than him, it's a great scene. But still one scene that always gets me rolling on the floor laughing is when Peter Pan tells Captain Hook to scream in front of his crew and Peter's lost boys that he's a codfish, and you see everyone just cheer and make fun of Captain Hook as well as that blasted crocodile that won't leave him alone. This is such a great movie, if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it, it's a fun film to watch and will always hold a great place in my heart. 10/10"
1,Peter Pan,10,25 March 2003,One Of The Great Animated Films Of The 50s,"If Walt Disney had never made another cartoon feature after BAMBI in 1942 he would still be remembered as the man who transformed the animated full length film into an art form. SNOW WHITE , PINOCCHIO , FANTASIA and BAMBI all belong on the list of the greatest achievements in American Film. Disney's next phase in full length animation took place after World War 2 and although these subsequent works may not match the brilliance and creativity of the earlier films, they still possess the superb craftsmanship the Disney artists are famous for. Missing from the new batch of films was the meticulous background detail that distinguished the earlier projects. Starting with Cinderella in 1950, the animators seemed to concentrate more on clean, uncluttered backgrounds but the drawing was just as professional as before , characters still brought to life with fluid, lifelike movements. Colors tended to be bright and splashy, but the cartoonists also knew when subtlety was called for, and scenes occurring at night were done with convincing atmosphere and shadows. The success of Cinderella confirmed that the movie-going public was still willing to be entertained and moved by a cartoon movie, and Disney and his artists forged ahead with an impressive array of animated features that to this day remain models of the Art Form. Perhaps the greatest of these was PETER PAN, first released in 1953. Based on J.M. Barrie's immortal play and novel about the little boy who doesn't want to grow up, PETER PAN had been a project stewing in Disney's mind for years. It wasn't until after the War that work on the film really took off. When the movie was completed and finally released to theaters, Disney seemed rather ambivalent about its achievement. He had a hard time defining who Peter actually was as a character but to millions of children in movie theaters all over the world, that didn't seem to matter. PETER PAN is not very deep story-wise. It lacks the heart and sentiment of the Barrie original, which to some degree is a good thing. Past stage versions and the spectacular 1924 Paramount film version could be cloyingly sentimental at times.The Disney version is light and breezy and moves at a clip. The London sequence which opens the picture is spectacular in both the backdrops and the animation itself. When Peter, Wendy, John and Michael leap out of the Darling nursery window and fly over nighttime Edwardian London the viewer is treated to some of the most thrilling animation ever created for the movies. Later sections of the movie are equally enchanting, and the personage of the villainous Captain Hook is brought to great comic life by Disney animators and the marvelous vocal talent of Hans Conried. As with past Disney efforts, the song score is superb. ""Second Star to the Right"", ""You Can Fly"" and ""Your Mother and Mine"" are highlights in a tuneful soundtrack created by Sammy Cahn and Sammy Fain.PETER PAN holds a special place in my heart. It was the first movie I ever saw. As a 4 year old sitting with my father in an ornate, red carpeted movie palace in Cincinnati, Ohio, looking up at that big screen watching Peter and his friends swooping and flying over the roofs and spires of London was an overwhelming experience. I was hooked, so to speak, and it is an image that has stayed with me ever since. This is the film that initiated my love affair with movies. PETER PAN is one of the iconic films of the Baby Boom Generation."
2,Peter Pan,10,25 January 2003,Wonderful,"Except for The Jungle Book (which I watched every day as a kid), Peter Pan was probably my favorite Disney film during my childhood. Why? Its in the story. I mean, who hasn't been a kid and wished they could fly or do something else magical at least once in a lifetime? Neverland is a place kids dream about, having adventure with Indians and mermaids and pirates. That is what makes this film so wonderful, that despite its simple plot, its less than complex characters, it is something that brings back memories. It is something that kids can relate to, and something that teenagers and adults can watch and think, ""Ah, I remember when I used to wish I were like that."" There's no real moral, just a simple story that is purely entertainment. And that is why I loved this and The Jungle Book so much when I was a young kid. Now older, my perspectives have changed, but not even Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and Mulan, my three favorite Disney films, have such sentimental value to me as those two films do. Its just a shame that the sequel to Peter Pan was horrendous, I hope they don't do the same to The Jungle Book this February."
3,Peter Pan,,28 March 2000,"Wonderful, magical Disney classic","This is one of the most charming, magical movies ever!  It is an adaptation of James Barrie's Peter Pan, the story of the boy who wouldn't grow up.  It starts in London, where a very proper Wendy has one night left in the nursery before she most grow up.  Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Darling are out for an office party, and the nursemaid, a dog named Nana is tied up outside for the night.  Peter Pan comes and takes Wendy and her brothers John and Micheal away to Neverland, ""the second star to the right and staight on til morning"", with the help of the pixie dust from the jealous little pixie Tinkerbell. A sprinkling of the dust makes them fly, just like Peter does. Once in Neverland they encounter mermaids, Indians, and the foppish, but evil villian Captain Hook.  This beloved story will bring you back to your childhood and this delightful score will be hard to forget!  It is sure to have you singing along!  This is a wonderful movie that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike!"
4,Peter Pan,8,1 May 2004,A Classic That Still Soars,"""Peter Pan"" is without a doubt one of Disney's classics, alongside animated features such as ""Snow White"" and ""Pinocchio.""  It captures the imagination just as J.M. Barrie's novel and play have.  In the movie, the eternally young Peter Pan takes Wendy Darling and her brothers to Neverland, a place of the imagination, populated by Indians, mermaids and pirates.  Captain Hook, voiced by Hans Conreid, will always be a classic villain, and his henchman, Smee, is a perfect comic relief.  There are many funny scenes and good animated sequences.  Beneath it all, the story speaks to the kid in all of us.  We remember how important it can be to remain young at heart."
5,Peter Pan,10,21 June 2006,Magical. Simply magical.,"""Disney movies"" and ""children's movies"" are often used interchangeably, but I believe that Peter Pan is a truly captivating story for both young and old. As a child I was entranced by the beautiful colors and artwork, the mysterious fairies and their magical dust, and the elusive character of Peter Pan. I wanted nothing more than to catch a fairy and keep her as my own. I imagined her teaching me to fly and then leading the way to Neverland. I also found myself yelling at the television near the end of the movie when Peter refuses to go back to London with Wendy. They should get married, darn it! They're perfect together! Hey, I was a kid...Now, as an adult, I see the story for what I believe Sir James Barrie was trying to say. One stage tradition holds that Captain Hook and Mr. Darling are played by the same actor. Disney stuck with this by using the same voice actor. I believe that Barrie was trying to speak on poor father-child relations, which are still present today. Captain Hook is scary. Children fear and often do not understand their fathers. On a similar note is the crocodile which Hook so deeply fears. The crocodile swallowed a clock (as well as Hook's hand) and now chases Hook around. I believe that this symbolizes a man's fear of time. Or rather a father's fear that he is not close with his children and must hurry up before it's too late.I fell in love with Peter Pan (both the character and the movie) at a very young age (it was the first movie I ever saw) and continue to love it today. Young or old, boy or girl, man or woman, this movie will warm your heart and hopefully teach you a lesson or two."
6,Peter Pan,,24 July 2004,Another Disney classic...how many are there now?,"'Peter Pan' is undoubtedly one of the best of Disney's films. The story isn't too deep or meaningful, as, say, 'Bambi'. The power behind it is the familiarity. Every little kid yearns to haveadventures like Peter, so everyone identifies with the story. To tell the truth, the film is kind of episodic, like an extra-large TV cartoon special. The climax is fittingly climactic, but the final defeat of Hook isn't really powerful enough, which makes it disappointing after all the flashy swordplay. Speaking of Hook, he and Mr Smee are inevitably the scene-stealers, no matter how beloved Peter may be to children. The same way, in Hook/Smee scenes, if you throw in a hungry crocodile, the monstrous reptile will overshadow even Hook. Wendy really looks too old to be horrified about growing up, though, except for the sequences in which she fantasizes about Never Land with all the authenticity of a three-year-old. Never Land is beautiful, to say the least. The lush jungles and the mermaid lagoon is wonderfully brought to life, as is the eery Skull Island. This is the best showcase for the art direction. Also excellent is the detailed, meticulous design of the wooden hideout of the Lost Boys.'Peter Pan' is one of my all-time favorites. It has humor, great animation, and the best part of it is a simplistic story that revolves around the desires of the child within all of us (I'm still twelve, so I never had to look too deep). A must-see for any animation fan, particularly Disney buffs, the young and the young-at-heart.9/10"
7,Peter Pan,7,25 February 2003,Another blockbuster for Walt Disney,"This Disney cartoon classic offers flights of fancy that appeal directly to children's fertile imaginations. The ability to fly and be a devil-may-care youngster and never grow up, exploring a fantasy island of Indians, pirates, mermaids and mysterious caves is a powerful magnetic pull for young dreamers. The production's artwork is beautiful, and the characters and catchy tunes add to the pleasure of watching this movie. Peter Pan is nearly upstaged by his companion Tinker Bell, a temperamental pixie who is jealous and possessive of Peter's friendship with Wendy. Captain Hook and his shadow, the crocodile, the sniveling Smee, the beautiful mermaids, and the stoic Tiger Lily are all memorable characters. The catchy tunes also make this adventure one of Disney's best."
8,Peter Pan,,4 November 2000,Disney Version Technically Superb;Plot is Oversimplified,"Barrie's ""PeterPan"" is a highly complex story.There are strong elements of social satire,moral ambiguities,deep psychological issues,and emotional traumas investigated in this play.Almost all these aspects have been eliminated in the animated version.Topics such as: dealing with our parents,abandonment,mixed feelings toward our loved ones,and developing a mature adult libidinal attitude have all been erased.Hook's escape at the end,and the return of Peter AND the Lost Boys to Neverland violate some of the core elements of the story.Those criticisms aside,this is really well done.The animation is excellent;the characterizations are first-rate;and by actually having Peter done by a boy,an element of a (benign )sexual rivalry between Wendy and Tiger Lily is introduced.The boys,pirates,and Indians are marvelous,and the crocodile is a masterpiece.(He does act more like a dog than a reptile;Nana come back in disguise,maybe?He reminds me of a miniature dachshund I owned for 13 years.)This is probably the best way to introduce anyone to Peter Pan."
9,Peter Pan,9,20 October 2005,great politically incorrect fun,"Having seen this movie again several times recently, I have learned to appreciate this film a little more. While not nearly as good as some of the more famous Disney films (such as Beauty and the Beast, Bambi or Little Mermaid), it still deserves a 9 because it is head and shoulders better than other kids movies. The animation is very good, pace is fast and the movie is just fun. The negatives are simply a product of the times, in that this is about the most politically incorrect Disney film ever made (perhaps more so than Song of the South). I'm sure that MANY American Indians watch the film and deservedly cringe at the depiction of Indians, who seem rather dumb and sing the song ""what makes the red man red?""--an ode to every terrible stereotype about Indians. BUT, I am a strong believer in discussing these things and NOT condemning the entire film. In fact, I am a history teacher and have used the film to talk about these aspects of the film."
10,Peter Pan,,8 September 2000,Magnificent!,"Peter Pan is one of Disney`s best movies of all time. It is about the boy, who didn`t want to grow up and it is a fabolous adventure that is high on atmosphere, adventure, style and entertainment. Many of the songs are superb, and the voices are good.  Watch it with the original English dialogue, it is way better than the poorly dubbed versions that plague European countries. If you want a superb adventure, go for ""Peter Pan"". 9/10"
11,Peter Pan,10,8 January 2013,"Excellent, Entertaining, Imaginative, Magical, Inspirational Fun Film!","Peter Pan is my most favorite Disney film of all time and the best one in my book. This film, being 60 years old has the exciting youthful feel I'm sure it had in the beginning when first premiered in 1953. Walt Disney was a man of imagination and this film proves it for the entertaining, imaginative, and magical moments that go on in it.The film is the following: Excellent, entertaining, imaginative, magical, and inspirational, and I can put them all together.Wonderful story, excellent animation, outstanding voice cast (you couldn't pick anyone better in the day than Bobby Driscoll,there couldn't have been a better Peter Pan for the way he was portrayed: cocky, fun, exciting, imaginative, a fighter, though there he had a soft spot and was there whenever his friends needed him. Kathryn Beaumont, you can't compete for a better Wendy. As far as I'm concerned, Kathryn Beaumont was the best Wendy ever. Here, Wendy knew all about Peter Pan and was an optimistic female for there weren't many I'm sure in that day, also, she knew how to spin a perfect Peter Pan tale. Hans Conried was a magnificent Captain Hook. I really love how they Disney-sized him to be still evil, but not the type where you would actually murder someone and get away with it, so there he's different than the Captain Hook in the novel, and actually better. Bill Thompson was a hilarious Smee, they downsized him to be as sweet as sugar and complete opposite of the captain, which is the stereotype of a sidekick anyway. You couldn't have chosen a better Tinkerbell than Margaret Kerry. I think who deserves the most praise here is Paul Collins, the voice of John Darling, who is hardly recognized. He knew how to put the role to work without making it dull and boring, and John became one of my favorite characters of all time. Moving on, lastly, there is a wonderful score! The Second Star to the Right is a wonderful ballad, even the remakes were good (especially Jonatha Brooke, singer in the second film sang it like the ballad it is, but actually no one can compete with the Jud Conlon Chorus who practically sang all of the films' songs) You Can Fly! You Can Fly! You Can Fly!, whimsical and can put you on the edge of your seat, A Pirates Life, fun. Following the Leader, can have you sing along and make you laugh. What Makes The Red Man Red?- comical song, and can have you laughing your head off. Your Mother and Mine- a nice lullaby. And last but not least The Elegant Captain Hook, entertaining song, having kids enthralled by what goes on it a pirate's life, and being scared to death when threatened to walk the plank.If you own the Disney Classics Video to the Platinum Edition DVD, you will see the color is very beautiful and very experimental in the You Can Fly sequence drawing characters to fly.There are a lot of entertaining parts, especially concerning Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. Peter Pan when taunting Captain Hook the most throughout the film.The movie is both imaginative and magical at the same type because it's so unique. It's nothing like the original book and I'm sure that's what made it the huge hit it was. It's a shame that it didn't win anything, but it's still a 10/10 for me.The movie is also inspirational, because fans of Peter Pan can be free to make up their own stories.Peter Pan- Excellent, 10/10 film! Thank you, Walt Disney for bringing us the best of your masterpieces!"
12,Peter Pan,9,31 January 2013,Beloved 1953 animated adaptation of J.M. Barrie's book,"This beloved 1953 animated adaptation of J.M. Barrie's book was the last of Disney's films to be distributed through RKO Pictures. That fact gives it even more historical significance for cinema buffs. It's easily one of my favorite movies from the Mouse House because of its quick pace and borderline dark humor.Peter Pan returns to the nursery of Wendy, Michael, and John Darling after losing his shadow. He visits them frequently in secret to listen to Wendy's tales about himself and his adventures in Neverland. Peter accidentally wakes the children up and agrees to take them to Neverland with him. They soon get tangled up in a battle between with Captain Hook and his pirates. Joining them in their fight are the Lost Boys and the fairy Tinkerbell.""Peter Pan"" has something for everyone. There's a girl yearning for adventure, an Indian princess, a beautiful sparkling fairy, and mermaids for the younger female audiences out there. Boys can get excited over pirates, Indians, and mischievous little troublemakers who like to fight with each other. Adults will enjoy it because of its humor and ability to take them back to a more innocent time when they weren't bogged down with so many grown-up responsibilities.It's funny to watch ""Peter Pan"" now in the politically correct environment we live in. It's a children's cartoon in which we witness Captain Hook shoot a pirate for singing too loud, Peter make rude comments about girls, a little boy smoke a peace pipe, and listen to Indians sing about ""What Makes the Red Man Red."" Isn't it strange how what's acceptable changes over the years?"
13,Peter Pan,7,26 November 2012,the Crocodile is the best character in this movie,"Watching this movie 15 years after probably the last time I saw it, I still found myself laughing every time Peter Pan took on Hook, it was all arranged for laughs by Disney to make a mockery of the dear Captain Hook.My favorite character in the movie was not Peter, Hook, Wendy, Wendy's brothers or The Lost boys; my favorite character was the Crocodile. I can't just get it out of my head how he seems to be so creative in trying to catch Captain Hook, my favorite was when he pushed aside the boat that Hook was trying to jump into and he caught Hook in his mouth.Disney's Peter Pan animation was done in 1953 and it is based on the play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up in 1904 and a novel in 1911 by J. M. Barrie. It is the 14th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series.It features the adventures of Peter Pan a boy who could fly and wouldn't grow up and lives in Neverland with the lost boys. His partner or side kick is Tinker Bell a fairy. The story also features his adventures with Wendy and her brothers, as they learn to fly to Neverland, meet the mermaids, Tiger Lily and the red Indians. They also battle Captain Hook and his crew.Disney out did themselves in this money spinning classic, that raked in more than 20 times its production cost (making over 80 million in the box office), Peter Pan became a source of controversy in its stereotyping of its Characters, especially the Native Indians. If not for the time it was made such a movie will never leave the production board, due to its referring of the Indians as red and comparing them to hunting animals.Peter Pan was the last and final Disney film in which all nine members of Disney's Nine Old Men worked together as directing animators and it was the last movie that was distributed by RKO Radio Pictures before Walt Disney's founding of his own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.Peter Pan has remained a classic over the years for children and adults alike and it is one of my best Disney animations. I will like to say it is a nice watch and something to own and keep for later as you will love to see it years after, just to see the two (Peter and Hook) go at it again and if you are like me to see the Croc try to get Hook again.www.lagsreviews.com"
14,Peter Pan,6,15 March 2007,Buyer Beware of the Platinum Edition!,"The film deserves a 10 but this latest DVD transfer by DTS Digital Images has taken all the brilliance of the latest photochemical Technicolor restoration of this film and thrown it out the porthole...Exactly why that is is anybody's guess: Lack of respect of a 100 years of film-making, lack of interest in the film's history, colour-blindness, lack of supervision by Disney's Nine Old Men? A corporate decision to give the film a radical new look? The refusal on the restorers' part to remove their sunglasses? A horrible computer foul-up? You tell me! What is evident is that the colours have been drastically altered, the contrast is subdued and the bitrate is not very high. The colours are slanted, not so much towards yellow as towards gold. Everything is imbued with a golden glow which makes Tinker Bell the real heroine of the story and brings out the golden highlights on everything from Mr. Darling's cuff links to the golden ornaments on Hook's ship. Peter Pan's tunic is at times a sickly wilted parboiled creamed corn colour. There is no true blue sky, just a variant of Egyptian Blue. Neverland sometimes looks like your lazy neighbour's parched garden. The skies are often milky white or beige. The red and blue wallpaper in the Darling children's bedroom is now a brownish mushy mess. Mermaid Lagoon has lost its greenery and turned a repulsive and rather obscene labia pink... Having said this, it is quite possible that the unwary viewer, taken in by the quality of the animation and the beautifully restored sound, will overlook these limitations but it is still no excuse for this abomination, which is miles removed from the colour values of this film that have been preserved for 55 years in the form of its original artwork. It's a wild, one might say irresponsible concept, which some might call ""experimental"", except that experience has gone horribly wrong. What the digital ""restorers"" have actually done is to artificially deprive the yellow(negative)/blue(positive) layer of the original 3-strip Technicolor film of about half its information.On the down side, the Redskins have turned a politically correct pink. On the plus side, every brown and yellow surface is made to shine unnaturally, even at night, and lots of things are visible in the dark that weren't before. The reverse is true in the daytime.In the indoor scenes, this slant towards yellow makes sense as it replicates the warm, nostalgic, homey glow of lamplight. Otherwise... The best thing I can say is that it gives the viewer a brand new (though some might say old-fashioned) perspective on a film he's seen maybe too often and the total effect is unreal and reminiscent of a yellowed full-colour illustration in an old picture book. A quick look at the numerous art galleries in the extras will remind you that there should have been a whole lot more green and blue everywhere according to the original artwork.Where the PE really shines, though, is in the sound department which might persuade me to buy this edition (I only rented). The whole soundtrack (dialog, singing voices, orchestra, sound effects) has been completely rethought, refurbished and rechannelled creatively for 5.1 (in French and Spanish too). There is a lot of work evident also in the original mono track. But in the Enhanced home theatre mix (the word ""enhanced"" appears three times on the cover), very interesting things happen. The dialog is mostly in the center speaker but the music comes regularly through the other four speakers. At some points, individual instruments are made to come through all the surround speakers (like the harp, when Peter appears on the rooftop, instead of the flute, like you might guess). The sound of instruments and voices has been given more resonance. It is less harsh, dry or abrupt. The children voices are almost bearable in this version. There is nothing grating in the brass or in any other part of the orchestra. Everything sounds modern, natural and free-flowing. Of course, the sound effects have been amplified with bass and the mix makes good use of directional effects (Tinker Bell's glockenspiel and celesta, the crocodile's ticking clock, Peter's ghostly voice in Skull Rock). The whole film becomes a symphony where the music takes center stage without overshadowing the character voices, which are now disentangled from the surrounding music. This is an element that could have seriously added to the dream-like quality of the whole, were it no for the off-kilter colours. By comparison, the 5.1 mix of the Special Edition (2002) and the 4.0 mix of the Limited Edition (1999) was only fat, untreated mono with lots of harshness in the loud passages and instability in the soft ones.Well... considering the radical changes made to the colour palette, maybe they could have called this the ""Golden Slumbers Edition"" or ""Pixie Dust Edition"" or, better still ""Global Warming Edition""... And it's not something you can correct with the Tint button (which adds red or green) or with the Cold setting (which adds a little blue). But it's perfect if you are sound-oriented and an improved sound is very important to you, if you have no memories of what ""Peter Pan"" used to look like or if you really pictured Hook's harpsichord as being made of solid gold."
15,Peter Pan,8,13 December 2016,"Classy Disney tale with unforgettable roles : Hook , Tink,  Smee , the Lost Boys, Tiger Lily  and based on  Sir James M.

A great cast of actors to be used to shoot this classy including Hans Conried (Hook) , Bobby Driscoll (Peter Pan) , Bill Thompson (Mr. Smee) , Heather Angel (Mrs. Darling) , among others . Disney went on to exasperate purist fans (similarly to cartoon rendition ¨Alice in Wonderland¨) using American boy star Bobby Driscoll's voice for Pan and modelling Tinkerbell on Marilyn Monroe . Many Peter Pan purists were very upset by the characterization of Tinker Bell as a petulant and voluptuous young woman as old film ¨Peter Pan¨ as its sequel titled ¨Return to Never Land¨ . The fable will appeal to adventure and classic tale fan . Rating : 8/10 above average . It's a terrific familiar amusement that will appeal to vintage tale fans .Other films and stage productions dealing with this classic personage are the followings : The original Broadway production of ""Peter Pan"", or ""The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up"" by J.M.

16,Peter Pan,10,5 February 2006,The J.M. Barrie classic comes to life!,"The Darlings live in a small house in London with their three children: Wendy, John, and Michael. The children love to tell tales about their favorite hero Peter Pan, a boy who will never grow up. Mr. Darling, however, decides that it is time for Wendy to grow up. Later that night, while the Darlings are away at a party, Peter Pan shows up to find his shadow along with the sassy fairy Tinker Bell. Wendy wakes up to discover Peter. He tells her about Neverland, his home. Soon, Peter, Wendy and her brothers are off to Neverland. When the evil pirate Captain Hook discovers that Peter is back, he kidnaps Wendy, John, Michael, and The Lost Boys, Peter's buddies. Peter, with the help of Tinker Bell, saves the day.This Disney classic is an audience pleaser, even after 53 years when it was first released. It is wonderfully adapted from the J.M. Barrie book and play. It also has a wonderful voice cast, including Disney veteran Bobby Driscoll as Peter, Kathryn Beaumount (who played the title role in Disney's ALICE IN WONDERLAND) as Wendy, and Hans Conried, playing both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling. The songs, including ""Following the Leader"", ""The Second Star to the Right"", and ""You Can Fly! You Can Fly!"", are memorable. A true Disney masterpiece! 10/10"
17,Peter Pan,9,26 January 1999,"I dunno about you, but it lives in mine!","This was one of the best Disney classics, no masterpieces made, it was funny, colorful, lively, stylish, entertaining, thrilling, and had everything in it, to go round. I give it a 9 out of 10."
18,Peter Pan,8,9 March 2006,Delightful film-Tinker Bell a wonder,"This is a nice, fun film.Tinker Bell is one of my favorite Disney characters. She is fun, has a temper, loyalty, gets jealous.And, I confess this is the ONLY version of the Peter Pan story I have ever seen, except for 1991 ""Hook"".No Mary Martin, No Cathy Rigby either.This is Peter Pan & the only version of interest of me.Already out on DVD twice, Disney needs to release a special edition with extras.Course, the impact of the Tinker Bell character to Disney. One character people just love & you do see her everywhere.Captain Hook is one of my favorite Disney villains. Mr Smee behind him, those 2 make a good match.Wonderful music.And, I can not forget Tic Toc. A favorite scene from the film, a little one, when he misses Hook YET again & he hits the water with the fin/fist/claw."
19,Peter Pan,10,20 August 2003,"When Peter flew from J.M. Barrie's head, Walt Disney followed him onto technicolor","Peter Pan is one of my all-time favorite Disney films. A classic from the old days and one of those films that don't lose their magic touch. And their humor. A funny, adventurous film that has become immortal. Also, it has one of Disney's most famous characters, Tinker Bell. That pixie dust of hers made Peter Pan fly into victory. Captain Hook is very amusing alongside his amusing first mate, Mr. Smee. ""Classic"" is written all over this film. Watching Peter Pan fighting off pirates is exciting and watching Captain Hook whine like a girl when Tick Tock's around is very amusing. The ride at Disneyland may be short, but the film on my TV screen will never be too long. Disney is a wonderful animator genius. Good job, Walt. No! Excellent job!! Rest in peace."
20,Peter Pan,10,6 December 1999,Fun filled movie for the whole family,"The first time I ever had the pleasure of watching the Peter Pan story was with the Steven Spielberg production of Hook.I found the Walt Disney 1953 version of Peter Pan outstanding in every way. Like all of the Disney animated classics I can honestly say when you sit down to watch one you just forget that it is an animated feature that you are viewing and Peter Pan is no exception.Peter Pan is the story of a boy who refuses to grow up.  This production has so much to offer the viewer with the humour, music and action scenes especially with Peter Pan and Hook.  But we must not forget Wendy and her two brothers John, Michael and of cause Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys and the magical island in the heavens called Never Land where the story takes place.
So if you like a fun filled action adventure Peter Pan is certainly for you."
21,Peter Pan,9,24 May 2013,One of my childhood favourites,"I loved 'Peter Pan' so much when I was little that I had a birthday cake of the memorable 'You Can Fly' scene, dressed up as him whilst doing a sponsored walk, pretended that sand was pixie dust to make me fly (although it never worked!) and watched the video constantly. Now, at the grand age of 26, I own the DVD along with its sequel 'Return to Neverland,' which is almost as good. It's hard to believe that the original film is 60 years old now and it has kept its sparkle ever since.There are so many strong points of this film I don't know which one to begin with. First of all the animation is as good as I remember but today I have only just spotted the goof of Wendy's facial features disappearing for a second or two as she flies from Big Ben during 'You Can Fly.' Secondly the majority of songs are melodic and impeccably sung, especially 'You Can Fly,' 'Following the Leader' and 'Your Mother and Mine,' which is beautiful and not quite as tear-jerking as 'Baby of Mine' from 'Dumbo' - that song really made me bawl my eyes out. Thirdly most of the dialogue is memorable and the film is even funny in parts, particularly George hitting his head on the drawer at the beginning and Peter Pan pretending to be an evil spirit and Captain Hook. I also like the voices of Peter and Cubby (The Lost Boy who looks like a bear) in this film better than in the sequel. The pace, however, has varied from being quite slow as a child to being faster than I thought as an adult, but that's not a bad thing. I guess I put it down to not paying attention to the film's running time when I was small.Overall, 'Peter Pan' is a Disney classic worth re-visiting and it is just as enjoyable to watch as an adult as it was when I was a child. 9/10."
22,Peter Pan,,23 September 2011,A great classic!,"What a great classic! Don't we wish we were all kids who could fly and that there were pirate adventures and adventures with the Indians and mermaids and so on? In this movie the kids go on the adventure in 'real life'. In this case their parents were the ones with no faith (until the end) and the kids weren't wanting to 'grow up'.This adventure shows a fairy tale guy named Peter Pan who happened to have the ability to fly and had a friend Tinkerbell who happened to get jealous when a girl named Wendy came into the scene. There's a pirate named Captain Hook who happens to want to do anything to get his way with Peter.It goes through an interesting adventure with mermaids and Indians and jealously and pirates and so on.Very great, rated 8/10."
23,Peter Pan,10,24 December 2010,"Think Of Christmas, Think Of Snow, Think Of Sleigh Bells Off You Go...","and just think of all the joy you'll find when you leave this hum drum world behind. isn't that why we do this in the first place? to escape the hum drum but stressful real world?the original Disney classics that were made while WD was still alive are hard to rate. some are definitely better than others, but all the original Disney animated features deserve 10 stars in my book. they are all so brilliantly conceived and much better than the later or current animated films made after his death.there are better Disney animated features than 'Peter Pan', and personally, my favorite version is the Leigh and Charlap musical with Cathy Rigby in the role. for me Rigby will always be the definitive 'Pan'. people forget that 'Peter Pan' was originally a stage play and meant to be a pantomime. that's why women played her. most 'Peter Pan' fans surprisingly don't seem to get this.Disney's 'Peter Pan' is totally charming and completely disarming however. and what the Disney version lacks as a adaptation, it more than compensates as a animated film. to this day, like all his classics of hand drawn animation, it remains a testament to the form and really has no peers. as a adaptation this version is rather vulgar and coarse at times, but as hand drawn animation it's superlative. and as hand drawn animation it's flawless and perfect. you really couldn't ask for more.i wouldn't know where to begin. all classics really deserve textual analysis but hey, i'm no intellectual so i'll leave that one to others. but i must say the very best thing i've always felt about this Disneyized version, is it's beautiful color styling and design. newbie Disney aficionados love to claim all the digital enhancement has made these better films. not true. false. wrong. i saw this film many times at the movie theaters and even saw it's last reissue in the 1980's. my memory is not that bad. the films have always looked as wonderful back then as they do today. the enhancement is mostly for TV set viewing which is different than the old celluloid viewings. Disney films have always looked great, the younger generation just doesn't know that.this was also the first film that was acted by a male. way before Jeremy Sumpter, who did an outstanding job i might add. but before Sumpter's brilliant interpretation there was Disney star Bobby Driscoll.aside from the amazing Ludivine Sagnier, this is the definitive Tinkerbell. i know, i know. on stage she's a ball of light and pretty much described that way in Barrie's book. but the Disney interpretation of Tinkerbell is so damned hilarious that you can't resist it. and the original classic film captures the petulance of the spiteful sprite unlike the infantile CGI 'Enchated Tinkerbell' movies that turn Tink into a goody two shoes conformist nit. i think the original Disney Tinkerbell is a funny hoot. the 'enchanted' CGI Tinkerbell just makes me want to get out a fly swatter and make her go away.the original Disney 'Peter Pan' boast colorful and lush visuals as well as some of the funniest and most comical animation the Disney studios ever made. it's a true mind blowing feast for the senses. and the music is wonderful.anyone willing to be a true connoisseur of Barrie should ignore the recent 'enchanted pixie hollow' mess. they are even more removed from Barrie than the original hand drawn Disney classic. and Barrie would have hated them. he always meant Tinkerbell to be petulant and rather heartless. i think if JMB saw the marshmallow she's become he would get out the fly swatter too and put an end to that whole thing. JMB's 'Peter Pan' is a cherished classic and a monument in children's literature. and it should be taken with a little more faithfulness than the CGI films allow.kudos once more to the enigma we know as Walt Disney. he was a truly complicated personality with so many contradictions. he turned all the classics into his own vision, but surprisingly didn't ruin them. trust me. i used to be a reader once upon a time and have read em all from Barrie to Carroll to Collodi and Grim. Disney always does things his way, but manages to come out on top. life would be somewhat empty without him. i just love the eccentric nut job. and i love his classic films."
24,Peter Pan,9,9 March 2009,A great classic!,"Peter Pan is a very good movie indeed, which is more to be said for its sequel, which I think is one of the worst Disney sequels. While enormously entertaining especially with Hook and the crocodile, it lacks the complexity of the book. However, the animation is beautiful, especially our first look at Neverland and the Mermaid Lagoon. The songs are also lovely, especially ""2nd Star to the Right"" and ""You can Fly"". I loved the characters. Peter and the Darlings were well done, as well as the lost Boys. I also loved Tinker Bell, and Captain Hook, who was a great villain, until the sequel ruined him. If you want a more complex Hook, try Tim Curry's Hook in the animated TV series Peter Pan and the Pirates, which I personally think should be brought back. Captain Hook was wonderful here, in the series, and Jason Issac's interpretation of the character isn't to be missed either. 9/10 Bethany Cox. PS. I loved the crocodile!"
25,Peter Pan,8,20 March 2006,Cool.,"Without this movie, many things would not have been possible. I went to Disneyland many times last year, and I saw the fireworks display nearly every night.This movie is what makes things possible. Some people think it's ""racist"" but I disagree. The Indian scenes made it a little interesting. But I like Tinker Bell; she's one of the most important Disney characters ever created; and she wasn't even created by Walt Disney, but by Peter Pan's creator, J.M. Barrie.I have yet to see ""Finding Neverland,"" but I'm sure it deserved the ""Best Picture"" Oscar much more than ""Million Dollar Baby."" Back to Peter Pan. The sequel was not very good, but it was made only a few years ago.My score: 7/10."
26,Peter Pan,7,27 June 2003,"Nice, but I have seen better","After great Disney classics like 'Snow White', 'Pinocchio', 'Bambi' and 'Dumbo' and a nice one like 'Alice in Wonderland' I have to say 'Peter Pan' is a little disappointing. Just a little though. It has all the nice Disney ingredients so it is still pretty entertaining. The crocodile that has eaten the hand of Hook (and the ticking clock) and wants the rest of his body has the funniest scenes, one with Smee (voice by Bill Thompson) in particular. Hook (Hans Conried) and Peter Pan (Bobby Driscoll) have some funny scenes as well. Wendy (Kathryn Beaumont, also voice of Alice in 'Alice in Wonderland') is your usual Disney woman, adorable but sometimes a little too good and brave. All this together makes a nice Disney movie, but not much more than that."
27,Peter Pan,7,31 December 2005,"""All this has happened before, and it will all happen again...""","Walt Disney's loving animated rendering of James Barrie's play ""Peter Pan"" is another one of the great Disney classics that must be seen by all lovers of animated film. Story of a boy from Never Never Land who flies and refuses to grow up doesn't hold a lot of great significance, but it is boldly fantastic and sweetly sentimental nevertheless. The voice-work (particularly by Bobby Driscoll as Peter) is fabulous, as are the smart, lively musical cues and background design (when Pan leads the Darling children over the clouds miles above London, the depth and color and swooping action are really exciting). The song score isn't up to Disney's best, although the entire ""You Can Fly"" sequence is a centerpiece attraction in and of itself. The direction smoothly introduces all the characters, but there's a poor gap in the narrative after Tinker Bell is apparently hurt in an accident; also, there's far too much of the ticking crocodile (designed to mug for the camera). Still, vain pixie Tinker Bell provides a lot of visual slapstick and the ending is heartwarming. *** from ****"
28,Peter Pan,8,20 January 2009,Charming fantasy that brings up the hard message of growing up,"Peter Pan takes Wendy, John and Michael to Neverland, a place where kids never have to grow up.What makes Walt Disney's films so brilliant? Is it the sweet humorous narrative? The colourful characters? The animation? When you look at all his greatest creations, each have a sentimental message encoded. Robin Hood looked at the rich and the poor, Jungle Book triumphantly produced the message of home and the Lion King dramatically reflected on the circle of life. The list is endless and the important message encoded into this classic is growing up.Made in 1953, Peter Pan's message is still relevant today as it once was and continues to please as well as educate through this realistic issue.Growing up is as inevitable as tomorrow and the chance to stay young is something every adult and child has contemplated. They say the best experiences happen at a young age, that youthful imagination and freedom and lack of escapism has all reminiscing.Peter Pan embodies this concept, a young boy who wants to stay youthful forever and in this picture we explore the ups and downs in a mystical adventure.The story stars in London where Wendy is told she will be moving out of the nursery to grow up. The poor dialogue is forgotten as we feel the passion of her domineering father.The film is then turned on its head as Peter Pan enters to take the children to Neverland, a place still remembered today.Neverland is a fine creation. From the evil pirates to the magical mermaids, the place embodies a sense of adventure and excitement. The feeling of anticipation in never lost as the characters make their way around the island, and you get the feeling there is so much more, which raises plenty of imaginative questions.The plot is consistent containing some very funny moments, watch out for the crocodile, an excellent ticking clock creation.There are a few times when realism is thrown away to create excitement, plus there is a share of annoying characters.However with its sense of exploration and solid humour, Peter Pan tells a charming tale of growing up in a sparkling way that will please the family."
29,Peter Pan,9,9 March 2003,This movie is really great!,"Some might think it is childish in nature, but I would disagree! This is a great movie for people of any age! If you have not seen it yet, I would strongly recommend to get it ASAP. Peter Pan is a great metaphor in my opinion, there is a lot to be found between the lines."
30,Peter Pan,8,22 July 2017,The Ultimate Children's Fantasy,"Disney had returned to the feature film arena in the late 1940's. Many of the features that he produced in the 1950's were intended to be produced in the early 40's, but economic and labor setbacks as well as WWII put those projects on hold. It it interesting to see how Peter Pan would have looked had it been released in 1941 or 1942. Disney's Peter Pan doesn't glamorize childhood, but rather shows the dark side of the ultimate child's fantasy. Wendy doesn't want to grow up, but after numerous bad experiences with virtually every local at Neverland, she sees the light and desires to move on with her life. (A similar theme of a girl fantasying about another world despite her superior's objections, only for her to come to mature after experiencing turmoil was previously explored in Alice In Wonderland). The depiction of Native Americans and use of ethnic slurs has been controversial in recent years, but Disney hasn't pulled this out of circulation, nor has there been any significant pressure to do so. I sensed that they intended these to be fun characters. This is probably one of the most colorful and lush of Disney's post-war films. Mary Blair made excellent color designs for the Darling's nursery and the many Neverland spots. One could only imagine what the picture would have looked like had it been produced a decade earlier when they went all out on lush pictures. Despite some blatant Native American stereotypes, this has remained a beloved classic well into the 21st century."
31,Peter Pan,10,28 September 2016,Another Classic Disney Film,"Haven't you ever wanted to get away from the world around you and go to a far away land with the excitement of a child and the enthusiasm of going on an adventure? I certainly have, which is why I love the classic animation Peter Pan. What I like most about this movie is the fact that it's not only a children's movie, but a great movie for adults too. Watching this movie makes you wish that you were a kid again. It displays our innocence as a child, which we lose as we grow up. That is why the film is so refreshing to watch. The music is another part I really enjoy. It makes the movie more interesting to watch and it fits perfectly with plot of the story. The writers also did a marvelous job at developing characterization through most of the characters. As a whole, the film is easily understood, it is well put together, the characters are unique and fun, and just the story itself is wonderful and creative. As you can see, I do recommend this movie for all children and adults because it's very entertaining, but most of all it re-kindles the child innocence within the ones who've lost it and it adds to those who still have it."
32,Peter Pan,7,10 July 2016,A good film that sometimes gets unfair criticism.,"Peter Pan is a boy who would not grow up and went to a magical land, Neverland. But everything changes when Wendy and her brothers are taken there by his hand. Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske, has a screenplay by Ted Sears and his team and a competent voice actors team. The production was in charge of Walt Disney himself.This is one of the most interesting films that Disney released in the life of its founder and master. We cannot say that is the best, but it certainly is very interesting anyway. The drawings were made with bright colors but without excessive glare. The characters are good, steering with the majority of children's stories and the imagination of most children of that time, with the Indians, pirates, fairies and the desire to fly. The plot is good, has excellent situational jokes and the figure of the main villain, Captain Hook, is key to many of these comic moments. Tinker Bell is a very ambivalent character, because it seems to be half in love with Peter Pan, a kind of Platonic love. The musical moments are interesting, though more discreet and less memorable than what we see at other Disney films of the same era.Although there are many criticisms of the way this film portrays the Indians, I do not think the film deserves these same criticisms. I think I've seen much more racist and prejudiced characterizations in many western movies and never saw anyone upset about it. This film is for children and, therefore, all are portrayed (pirates, Indians or even the English) in a way that appeals to children, the target audience of the film itself, regardless of how they are. Does anyone think that the pirates were really like Hook? Of course not.Enjoy this film for what it is, see this movie with child's eyes."
33,Peter Pan,7,19 June 2016,A Timeless Disney Film With More Issues Than I Had Remembered,"Peter Pan is directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, and Hamilton Luske, and is a post war Disney animated film about a young man named Peter Pan that lives in Neverland, a place in the sky in which no one physically grows up. When Wendy, a teenage girl living in late 19th century Britain, decides she doesn't want to grow up, Peter escorts her and her two younger brothers to Neverland, where an evil pirate named Captain Hook is out to get revenge on Peter Pan.Many older Disney films are considered classics, and Peter Pan is definitely one of them. From the characters, to the top notch animation, Peter Pan is one of the most iconic animated films of all time. Even 60 years later, most everyone has seen Peter Pan, from people who grew up with it when it came out, to children who are growing up with it today. Rewatching Peter Pan, however, I found a few problems with it that stand out along with all of the great aspects of the film.To start, the animation in Peter Pan is absolutely timeless. Every hand drawn fame of the characters or environment looks amazing, and engulfs the viewer into the bright, whimsical place that is Neverland. All of the characters are also excellently animated, especially when in action. The two characters that stand out the most are that of Peter Pan and his rival, Captain Hook. This particular aspect demands that, in each scene, the viewers' eye is drawn to either of the two enemies, which was a very smart move on the filmmakers' part.On the subject of characters, all of the voice acting is very good, with great performances being given by, specifically, that of Bobby Driscoll (as Peter) and Hans Conried (as both Hook and Mr. Darling). These two play off of each other brilliantly, washing away all suspicion of two men recording in a studio. The other actors also do very well, and aren't necessarily outshadowed by that of Driscoll or Conried.One big issue I did find with Peter Pan was the pacing. It may be confusing to read, but the pacing in Peter Pan is so good that it makes a 77 minute film feel like 45 minutes. Each and every scene is so necessary that the film flies by very quickly. One blink could cause major confusion with how a character got from point A to point B, or where the characters even are. It may be hard to comprehend, but, once seeing the film, this problem is understandable.Another issue I found with the film is the writing for Peter Pan himself. Peter Pan, as written in the original play, is a fun loving child that never grows up. He is supposed to be free- spirited, and a caring person. However, the script for this film seems to portray Peter as a cocky, selfish jerk. He feels as if he's above the Darling children, and, at points in the film, is pretty close to being hated by the audience. He begins to get a bit annoying, and has the viewer rooting for Wendy and her brothers, therefore indirectly rooting for Peter, rather than having us root for Peter himself.Overall, Peter Pan isn't as fantastic as I had remembered it to be. Is it a good, timeless film? Yes, it is, but it has a few more problems that I see more clearly now than I used to. Anyone who isn't too hard on films will enjoy Peter Pan, and others will, too, because it is a pretty good movie."
34,Peter Pan,10,28 November 2008,The film that made Tinkerbell Disney's mascot,"Here is another story that I love after I read it in a book - Peter Pan: The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up. Peter Pan has appeared in numerous adaptations, sequels, and prequels since then, including various stage musicals, live-action feature films like Hook and the live-action version of Peter Pan that came out in 2003, and also the authorized sequel novel Peter Pan in Scarlet, that came out in 2006. Out of the adaptations that are the best, I would say that I love Disney's and the new live-action film; I not one to choose side you know.Disney's version of the story, is the widely known film version of the story. So popular that Peter's fairy friend Tinker Bell because the mascot of The Walt Disney Company, and the centerpiece of it's Disney Fairies media franchise including the direct-to-DVD film Tinker Bell. The film also shows Tink actually speaking; she didn't in the original film. Yes, I love this film. The animation and backgrounds are excellent and the casting is very good too, which reprises Kathryn Beaumont (who was the voice of Alice in Disney's Alice in Wonderland) as Wendy Darling. And I love 5 of the out the 6 songs from the film, which are: ""The Second Star to the Right,"" ""You Can Fly!"" ""Following the Leader,"" ""What Makes the Red Man Red?"" and... ""Your Mother and Mine"". But especially ""Second Star to the Right."" So overall, I would say this film is an excellent film for young and old alike."
35,Peter Pan,7,18 March 2007,"Not Disney's Best, But Certainly A Disney Classic","There are better Disney films to be seen; among them are Finding Nemo, Snow White, and Beauty and the Beast. However, this IS among their best, and one of my favorites. While entirely politically incorrect, this work retains the heart and love typically demonstrated by early Disney films.This is a grand adventure which provides you with superior animation, a beautiful soundtrack, well defined characters, and-for many-fond memories.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :."
36,Peter Pan,9,30 September 2003,Brings back childhood memories,"I first saw Peter Pan in 1990, when I was three.  We still have our beat-up copy of it, and each time I watch it, it's like I'm reliving 1990-1991 all over again.  Best time of my life.  I truly believed in Neverland, and became enthralled with mermaids and pirates and the idea of never growing up.  I now know that you can be an adult on the outside, but still be a child on the inside.  I'm sixteen now, and I'm still four years old on the inside.  This movie is a wonderful reminder of childhood."
37,Peter Pan,,26 October 2001,A beautiful movie with an everlasting magical touch to it!,"Peter Pan is a beautiful movie. It entrances you into the story and you just join in in the magic and fun. From the Darling nursery in downtown London, to the the night sky above England to the decks of Jolly Roger pirate ship, it is an everlasting tale for anyone"
38,Peter Pan,10,8 March 2002,Believe in the magic!,"When I first saw Peter Pan, I was in love. In the true Disney-era '50s opening sequence, I got goosebumps.The cheesy credits were so cute. IMO, at least. The storyline is great, and besides, flying?!?!?! Me and my sister always tried to fly, always failing, but it's so cool to watch Wendy, John, and Michael.But the sexism and racial stereotypes in Neverland shouldn't have been portrayed as ok. After all, Native Americans are people too.But I gave this movie a 10 and is one of my favorite movies."
39,Peter Pan,1,14 July 2007,Forgettable as independent and disgraceful as an adaptation,"I don't wonder why this, as far as I know, is considered one of the worst Disney classics ever and I DO wonder how in the world did they manage to have this as the iconic theme for Disney? I guess it is Disney that has made Peter Pan's character well known throughout these decades but only seemingly. I think it's not fair that they take so much credit, when they have never ever told the original story or introduced the original characters as they were meant to be or even got close.First: The characters. This movie makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in probably-not-Robin-Hood-costume and ignores all the persona characteristics in him that really matter. This movie makes Wendy a babbling idiot. And poor Captain Hook a TOTAL clown. The supposed-to-be-scary crocodile is a drooling puppy dog in this film. And of course as every Disney cartoon must have a character which has had too many hits in the head, they made one of the Lost Boys that one. The only character that has not been completely disgraced in this film is Tink. Even for an independent film that is a bad thing; none of the characters having any originality or depth in them.The story itself then? The Darling parents don't even get the time to notice their kids are gone!!! Probably one of the most significant point in the original story and they ruined it! Also the famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is a stunning piece of- There are no thimbles and no acorns - one of the little things that makes the original story such a unique one. It's a wonder he even had lost his shadow and she helped him stick it. (Even though to his shoes and it makes no sense to me.)And the ending is happy through and through. The story made NO difference to any of the characters what-so-ever. Their adventure was POINTLESS even if they were making memories. For the viewer there was no memorable scenes either. I kept forgetting almost everything about this film over and over again, even though I saw this countless of times when I was a kid, like 5 years old or so. I tried to watch this a few time when I was a teen, but again - forgettable! Clever bastards! Making it so forgettable that people end up watching it over again and again. I won't ever again, as now I've written down what I thought of it.Ruining a great story like this, just to amuse children should be illegal. So know now if you haven't known it before - this Disney version does not have anything significant in common with the original story - which is not really a children's story but just a great, great story.And as said, this film is very forgettable all in all. It can be enjoyable for very small children but almost insulting their intelligence by not being... well, more intelligent! And more colorful and more original. This just annoys me to no end."
40,Peter Pan,6,21 July 2007,More of nostalgic value than something else,"The 14th animated Disney classic is not one of my favorites. It was when I was a kid, but not so much now. There are plenty of other Disney classics which are always a pleasure to watch. However, the same doesn't happen with this one.That said, the movie isn't bad. In fact, it has its own charm and one has to recognize there is nostalgic value about it, not to mention that it's a magical movie. Anyone who was a child in my generation (and before that) is almost for sure familiar with the story of Peter Pan.Strangely, this was the first time that Peter Pan wasn't played by a girl. I have to admit that I was very surprised when I learned that Peter Pan was once played by girls.'Peter Pan' doesn't have the greatness of many other Disney classics. There is some good and some bad about it. What I dislike most about it is any sequence with the Indians. I also think that the Indians, the Lost Boys and most pirates are very poorly drawn. Plus, the Lost Boys are obnoxious and most pirates are annoying (except Captain Hook and Smee).Aside the badly designed characters, the movie's artwork is pretty good in general, with little to be improved. The Big Ben, for example, is amazingly drawn and looks every bit as majestic as it looks in reality. The close-up of Big Ben's clock makes one of this movie's best parts. London in general is well drawn too, the Neverland, Hook's elegant pirate ship... almost everything.There are even well drawn characters, such as Michael Darling, the Darling parents, Nana and Peter Pan.There are plenty of nice funny gags in the film, particularly almost every moment with Mr. Darling, as well as many moments with Hook, Smee and the crocodile. The funniest part of all is when Peter Pan fools Hook by pretending to be the voice of an evil spirit and Smee when he mimics perfectly Hook's voice.The best characters are Mr. Darling, Nana, Michael, Smee, the crocodile and Peter Pan. Why is that? Well, Mr. Darling is a practical and short-tempered father yet good-hearted and hilarious. Nana is the lovable St. Bernard-like babysitter dog. Michael is cute, adorable and innocent as the little one. Smee is more of a comic relief than evil. The crocodile is funny in appearance and personality. Peter Pan is a likable chap, although I recognize that he can be selfish and arrogant at times.Little Michael looks quite a lot like Disney legend Matthew Garber. You better believe I'd really believe that Matthew Garber served as the inspiration to create Michael if I didn't know that Matthew wasn't born until 1956 (this film came in 1953). But the similarities between them are amazing and, to accent them, Matthew played a character named Michael in 'Mary Poppins' (Banks instead of Darling).I almost forgot to talk about Tinkerbell. She is undeniably beautiful and elegant, but hardly likable. She is very jealous, treacherous and mean. She's got some highly questionable attitudes. It's difficult to feel sympathy for her.Captain Hook is indeed one of Disney's funniest villains. But that doesn't change the fact that he is very evil. I don't understand why so many people defend him. He does many despicable things, so he deserves to be tormented by Peter Pan and the crocodile.The Indian Chief is a sinister character. When he says «If Tiger Lily not back by sunset... burnum at stake», that is creepy. His powerful voice makes the line even more disturbing.The film has an interesting voice cast. Hans Conried does a good job both as Mr. Darling and as Captain Hook. Kathryn Beaumont (previously Alice's voice in 'Alice in Wonderland') repeats her talent as Wendy. Bill Thompson, a popular Disney voice, portrays comically well Mr. Smee. Tommy Luske captivates as Michael's voice. And finally the unforgettable Bobby Driscoll as Peter Pan (who also served as live-action model).I appreciate Bobby Driscoll as Pan's voice. This movie is perhaps what he is best remembered for. But as much as it was the pinnacle of his success and film career, it also turned out to be the end of his glory days. It was made in his early teen years and that was notorious in his change of voice. But little did he know what the future had in store for him...As for the soundtrack, it is okay. Some good musics, yes, but generally speaking, not really one of the great Disney soundtracks.To finish off, all you have to do is go to «Second star to the right and straight on till morning»."
41,Peter Pan,9,19 September 2005,Disney's best movie... until Lion King,"When I was a kid Peter Pan was with no doubt my hero. Growing up it later became Gambit, since, well, he rules. But I'll always remember Peter Pan as one of my favorite characters. And as one of my favorite movies.J.M. Barrie was a genius. This story has so many things that I, and many others, loved when we were kids. Pirates, Indians, a cool hero. I really like the story. And Disney made what no other film had done before. To capture the spirit in a very, very effective way. Being animated there was no limits and Peter Pan could truly be Peter Pan, without any annoying ropes from his back.This was one of my favorite film when I was a kid. And Disney best film ever... Until The Lion King came."
42,Peter Pan,,10 January 2007,Yech!,"Despite the wonderful animation, I have always disliked this rendition and from what I have gathered from Disney insiders Walt Disney did not exactly care for it either.None of J.M. Barrie's work is in evidence here. When I saw this as a child, it was my first clue that there was a serious problem with Disney productions writers; which continues to this day.Racist, sexist (need I go on?), claiming that this reflected the ""attitudes of the times"" is not only wrong - it is just a convenient cop-out. The only reason this was ever added to the family collection is because my mother insisted. I much prefer the 2003 production directed by P.J. Hogan, it is much closer to what Mr. Barrie actually wrote."
43,Peter Pan,8,2 November 1999,Disney's animators do what they can with Peter Pan,"I haven't read Barrie's book, so take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt.  But judging from the play, Disney's film, and Spielberg's dreadful `Hook' ... I don't like the WORLD of Peter Pan, and I don't see how anyone could.  Where's the magic?  It's just a series of children's make-believe games invested with solidity; and anyone who thinks there's anything particularly imaginative or interesting about the content of children's games must be unacquainted with children to the point of never having been one.Disney's film has assured animation, a GLORIOUS villain (Hook is a fop with no qualms whatever about killing people), and a Tinkerbell more motivated by sexual jealousy than anything else - she doesn't even try to charm people. So far, so good.  Never-neverland has been painted with lots of muted purples, its sombre, overcast skies cutting it off from the rest of the world.  An excellent touch.  But no-one can disguise the fact that it's still a dull place, requiring Hook's pirates to give it any life at all. And the story of the battle between Hook and Pan is not at all compelling. It's like a child's game in that it combines the unreality and incoherence of a dream with the greyness of a spur-of-the-moment lie, which is surely a bad thing.An exceptionally well made film, then, with basic material I simply can't warm to - and I think I'm right not to warm to it."
44,Peter Pan,8,11 September 2009,Think of A Wonderful Thought...,"Having seen live actions films, animated films, books and plays all done on this same story, I think I can say that I haven't come across a version yet where everything works perfectly. One of the best-known children stories of all time, Peter Pan is still loved and relevant, but each retelling has some difficulty to it that keeps it from reaching its full potential.In the Disney version, it is the character of Peter himself that holds the film back. I attended a stage version that was slightly more faithful to the original source material, and in it, Peter is much more dynamic (if you can believe that a boy who flies can by any more so). Walt Disney himself is said to have been dissatisfied with the result; I think it may have been a necessary evil to subdue Peter a bit to allow for a more balanced story, as he tends to overwhelm everything else in the traditional tellings.What this version DOES do well is create a mood and bring several other characters to life in memorable ways. Tinkerbell, who has become a franchise unto herself, is never as full of personality anywhere else as she is in the first half of this movie. In the DVD extras, she is analyzed as being a forerunner to the modern feminist. Sadly, she has little to do after the scene when she is banished. Wendy Darling is possibly one of the greatest animated characters in any hand drawn film--they way she moves, her facial gestures, her assertiveness all make her a joy to watch over and over. You might not notice it on a casual viewing, but if you watch her, they have drawn her character with a subtle depth that I don't notice in many animated movies, almost as if she was roto-scoped (which she may have been and I haven't found out yet). Most of the songs are likable enough that my two-year old tries to sing them, but nothing compares to ""You Can Fly!"" I would put that in a top ten of Disney songs, which is pretty amazing competition. Although I didn't watch this movie when I was a kid myself, when I hear the chorus singing that song, it evokes feelings of nostalgia as powerful as any of my own memories. Also, they dance that Tigerlily does seems like it would have been impossible to animate--that amazes me every time as well.Captain Hook is another character that is somewhat less enjoyable than the original play, though still a great villain. In all, there is lots to like and children and adults should be able to enjoy endless viewings of this together. I know my daughter and I do."
45,Peter Pan,8,7 April 2007,It was a Disney film,"I am 23 years old and this is my first time watching this movie. I enjoyed it very much and I think this was a good Disney film. The music was one of my favorite parts and I think the score was very important of the film. I like the silly humor and I miss that in the newer Disney films. I love the character of Nanna and thought it was a very well thought out character. There were actually a lot of holes in the story lines and the main characters, like how Tinkerbell wanted to KILL Wendy and how Peter Pan was just a little stuck up brat. It was also interesting to see what was socially acceptable in terms of Native Americans. I also liked how the movie was extremely violent and it just seemed liked it was almost trivializing the violence. The example that comes to head is when the ax hits the tree near Michael when the lost boys were hunting Indians. I also thought the movie was rather scandalous with the Mermaids and Tinkerbell's tiny outfit. The Smee character the crocodile was extremely well done and the scenes when Captain hook was trying not to get eaten were some of my favorites. It was a good movie and it is one of those classics I will want to have around for a while."
46,Peter Pan,9,13 January 2018,Think of all the joy you'll find When you leave the world behind And bid your cares goodbye,"Ever since its release in 1904, J.M. Barrie's famous play Peter & Wendy has become one of the highest regarded children plays of all time for its emphasis on childhood and imagination. While there have been countless adaptations of this work out there, arguably the most well known is the 1953 animated Disney film, and for very good reason. This is not only a charming and entertaining film in its own right, but it is also a rather heartwarming tale of what lies in a child's imagination.Probably the most iconic song from this film is You Can Fly, as it further emphasizes not only the many things you can dream of, but it also serves as a lovely tune to bring one back to a simpler time when they were children. Of course the other songs are well done too, from the melodious lullaby Second Star to the Right, to the highly upbeat Following the Leader, to the hilariously malicious Elegant Captain Hook. However, along with Your Mother and Mine as a beautiful contrast to reality, the aforementioned iconic song is a beautiful homage to simply embracing the imaginative fantasies that any child can dream of without wanting to grow up. Oh yeah, and even though What Made the Red Man Red is very dated given its subject matter, it's still entertaining nonetheless....if you're anti-PC that is.The characters are also a lot of fun, especially the main protagonists. Peter himself may be immature, but I'm sure anyone can relate as they felt that way when they were children, and his spirited nature does balance the cockiness out enough to make him endearing. Wendy does get pushed around quite a bit, but she does pose as a decent straight one to the wackiness in Neverland and a reminder to the audience that maybe it's best to grow up. Not to mention, the romance between Peter and Wendy is perfect for their respected ages, as it's never overdone (they never even kiss) and they're contrasting views on one another play a big role in their relation.As for Tinkerbell, she's pretty much the feminist of her day; always being snooty and trying to prove her way to others, even if she really does love Peter. With such a spunky personality and an emotionally driven arch, it's little wonder why she remains an iconic mascot for the Disney corporation. The other characters like John and Michael, the Lost Boys and the Pirates may be the least interesting characters in the film, but they definitely have their moments of witty banter here and there. However, probably the best character in the movie is the menacing albeit hysterical Captain Hook. Although he is insanely determined to seek vengeance on Pan over the loss of his hand to a crocodile, he is also hilarious from his childish fear of getting eaten by the crocodile and the banter between him and his first mate Mr. Smee. Seriously, whenever you see Hook, Smee and Tick Tock the Croc together, you will witness some of the greatest slapstick ever put to film, let alone animation. The timing, pacing, expressions and even vocals from Hans Conried are bound to have you ache from laughter.As usual for an animated Disney film, the animation is very well crafted. Along with the lovable and expressive character designs and character animation you'd expect from an animated Disney film, the flying scenes are simply breathtaking (hence another reason You Can Fly is so fondly remembered). The crew behind the lush artwork of Neverland really do deserve immense acclaim for the lush artwork, especially Mary Blair. Neverland really does feel like a highly adventurous place any child would want to go to, even with some dangers like pirates and mermaids. Not to mention, the way the animators were able to experiment with water, pixie dust, smoke and especially explosions are highly creative and magical in their own way.With exciting obstacles, charming characters, breathtaking visuals and timelessly catchy songs, Peter Pan nails the childlike adventure on a silver platter. Even if it's not quite as dark as the original play, it still respects the ideology of growing up from one's childhood fantasy that made it beloved for over 65 years. I'd say that children of all ages can enjoy this; boys can get into the swashbuckling and action whereas girls can get into the fairies, romance and even flying. Heck, even adults can have fun with this due to how entertainingly fun and even emotional at times it is, as it may bring them back to memories of when they were younger...by age 12 that is."
47,Peter Pan,7,5 January 2018,It may never age as a whole,"As with my past few reviews, I got to view this movie thanks to my Disneyphilic aunt, who likes this movie so much that she has both the 1990 and 1997 VHS releases. Since the 1990 release first caught my eye, we decided to view it since we had almost too much leisure time today. My thoughts are?The story brings with it quite an enjoyable amount of wit and some surprisingly effective slapstick (especially by today's standards), though I was indeed disappointed at how they took some liberties from the play regarding the fictional Piccaninny tribe. I wasn't particularly shocked at the stereotypes, but it didn't contribute much to the humor or anything of quality. When it comes to the characters, I did appreciate how they made Tinker Bell helpful but with just the right amount of sass to make her stand out more from previous Disney heroines. I also identified a lot with Wendy's perspective on several things, such as Pan's behavior. Pan himself is rather fun, though he as well as the Jolly Roger's crew did make this one of the sillier Disney movies. I could appreciate that; the humor as I mentioned does mostly work. What the animation doesn't convey in settings and effects compared to prior Disney movies, it does convey in the character movement to enrich the slapstick. I didn't particularly care for the music, because it's really forgettable and doesn't deserve to be the first thing people remember about this movie.This is yet another Disney winner that I'm certain will be enjoyed by most families. Others might object to the portrayal of the Piccaninny tribe as stereotypical Natives or be repulsed by the surprisingly colorful description of how Captain Hook got his name. Even then, I would say this is worth it for some laughs over 76 minutes."
48,Peter Pan,8,11 August 2017,Magical,"For some reason, this never really appealed to me until yesterday. I thought it was okay, not that magical, and though occupying, not captivating or entertaining.But like I did with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, I am asking myself what was wrong with me. Something told me I needed to watch it again, and I did. I was blown away and touched at the same time. This is incredibly magical and adventurous. From plot to characters to animation, it's all beautiful. Though Peter Pan is stuck up, he is still likable. Tinker Bell can sometimes be--well, a jerk--but she is still fun, with all her sauciness. The Lost Boys are likable, and Wendy is a great character and singer. Speaking of songs, I do not find many of them memorable, except for ""Your Mother and Mine,"" and the song sung by a chorus when Peter Pan and the Darling children are first flying outside. Oh, that moment is magical. It is so sweet and memorable, something that you'd love to watch over and over again. Now, of course, it's not all perfect. Like I said, not many of the songs are memorable, and there are a bunch of cheesy gags that don't appeal to us (after all, this came out 64 years ago). But in the end, this is a wonderful movie. Though it's not perfect, it's still magical and captivating. I sincerely hope it is added to the Walt Disney Signature Collection, a collection of Disney animated movies on Blu-ray that are famous, wonderful, and well-loved. That is exactly the way Peter Pan should be looked at."
49,Peter Pan,8,26 January 2016,"A timeless, ageless, classic.","Walt Disney's Peter Pan has become a beloved classic, cherished by generations of audience members of all ages. And its no wonder why. Most everyone can relate to the enchantment of wanting to stay young forever, all the while going on an adventure in a far off land. It's a simple story that's been told time and time again, on both stage and screen, but Walt Disney's version of Peter Pan is probably the most recognizable. The design of the film is not quite as remarkable as some of the company's other productions, coming right off the design of Alice in Wonderland, but its still beautiful none-the-less. The animation itself is the most spectacular aspect of the movie as the movie is very character driven. As the story runs that fine line that crosses from close and emotional moments to pure slapstick comedy, the animation reflects it all, developing some of the strongest personalities to come from Disney.The characters, as well known as they are outside of this film, are very quintessential Disney here. The Darling children are grounded as the real audience experiencing magic for the first time. We see through their eyes and experience the wonder with them as they visit Neverland. While Wendy says she doesn't want to grow up, and is mesmerized by the wonderful things she sees around her, she also naturally takes on the role of the mother, fleshing her out into a character who also understands responsibility and seriousness where no one else does.Peter Pan somehow manages to be both a brat and charming at the same time. He is the timeless boy, literally, that everyone wants to hold onto. All the girls are simply head over heels for him and all the boys aspire to be like him. He is the definitive boy hero. Captain Hook is surprisingly a mostly silly villain, even becoming the butt of many jokes, but this still doesn't diminish his dangerousness. You never forget for a moment that he is ready to take down Peter Pan. His best moments are as a speaker, such as his moment playing the piano with his hook while talking with Tinker Bell. Here, you see scheming and the true great threat right in his eyes. It's also a nice nod that the voice-actor who plays Hook continues the tradition of playing the Darling father as well.Tinker Bell has some of the best moments in the movie, especially for a sidekick. Scenes like her noticing the size of her hips while standing on a mirror or literally turning red in anger add so much to her character. And the fact that she doesn't speak, only giving sounds of a bell as per the original story, makes her moments of pantomime that much greater. It's no wonder she would go on to have an illustrious career as a character on her own outside of the film, but unfortunately she has never again had the charm that she has here.Other sidekick characters also leave a mark. Mr. Smee is one of the most unforgettable villain henchmen, and Tick-Tock the crocodile offers the biggest action scenes in the film, chasing off Hook. Unfortunately, the portrayal of the Indians is very stereotypical of the times, a misstep that surprisingly hasn't been edited out like some of Disney's other objectionable film moments. But even they have lovingly memorable scenes.Disney yet again captures all of this youthful innocence with vibrant animation, catchy songs and characters that seem to lead a life all their own. It's not about wondering what's going to happen at the end of the film, but about how these characters are going to lead you there through this familiar story. Peter Pan truly is ageless and will no doubt continue to be enjoyed by audiences for years to come."
50,Peter Pan,8,15 January 2016,"Sweet, fun Disney classic","Sweet, fun Disney classic.Based on James Barrie's famous book, the story of Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up. We see his battles with Captain Hook, Smee and company, accompanied by Wendy, John and Michael and, of course, Tinker Bell...Wonderful adaptation of the novel. Fast-paced, funny and with a great vibrance and message. Animation is excellent and still looks fantastic, over 60 years later. There's not much music, but the tunes there are are very catchy. Good voice casting too.An animated classic, suitable for all ages."
51,Peter Pan,7,12 January 2016,A flawed Disney masterpiece,"Peter Pan has pretty much everything you could want from a Disney fantasy. There's adventure, romance, swordplay and comedy all mixed together to create a film that effectively captures your imagination. Based on the play and novel by J. M. Barrie, Disney plays the film more as a wide-eyed adventure with the darker and more psychological elements played down. Peter Pan is the boy that never grew up who whisks Wendy and her brothers off to Neverland for the journey of a lifetime. Numerous events take place including meeting mermaids, Indians and of course battling Peter's arch- nemesis Captain Hook. The films narrative is quite straight-forward, the children explore various regions of Neverland and Captain Hook repeatedly tries to get defeat Peter.The characters are the true focus of the film and they are a mixed bag. Peter himself is very assured, confident and a resourceful leader, while his relationship with Wendy does feel genuine. The problem I have with him is that he is somewhat unlikeable. In the original Barrie novel he was egotistical and unpleasant so Disney were accurate, but it means that he isn't an engaging lead because he appears so unsympathetic at times. Tinkerbell suffers exactly the same issue. Her jealousy is understandable and her reactions can be funny, but going as far as trying have Wendy killed is simply too much and it is difficult to get you to care for a character who would go to such vicious extremes. Wendy is nice enough but she's just kind of bland. Kathryn Beaumont gives her a lot of energy, but she doesn't do or say anything of note and is just a dull character in general. The same goes for John and Michael. John is enjoyably geeky and Michael is a cute innocent, but they don't have much character beyond that and they end up feeling like more a side note than the main characters. The Lost Boys are simply forgettable. Giving them their own animal skins is a nice touch, but if it wasn't for that it would be hard to identify them. It is difficult to give so many characters identities, but it's difficult to care about them if they're so bland. The sequences with the Indians are now notorious for the borderline racist portrayal, it never bothered me but I can see how it might offend. Where it does succeed is with its villains. Both Captain Hook and Mr. Smee are brilliant. Hook is the perfect balance of threatening and hilarious, blending both seamlessly at certain times. There's a real intensity and menace to him when he plots against Peter, he shows his cunning in tricking Tinkerbell and we even see him shoot one of his own men for singing at one point. Yet he is just as quick to turn into a quivering mess once the crocodile shows up, cowering at every opportunity and verging on a breakdown. Smee is extremely enjoyable and Bill Thompson does a wonderful job voice wise, he's just too gentle and bumbling to be a pirate. His dialogue and reactions are always funny, while its comedy gold when the two of them are together.The animation for the most part is excellent. It always amazes me at how flowing it is as the characters are always on the go or there always seems to be something taking place, yet everything moves very smoothly and the animation is more restrained whilst retaining the brighter elements of earlier work. Neverland does look like a magical place and I do enjoy the sense of location you get with it. The comedic pieces are fantastic. As said whenever Hook and Smee are together it's funny, but the scenes with the crocodile and Hook are some of the best animated slapstick I've ever seen, everything from how quick the movements are to the sound effects are hysterical. The music is also excellent. The score by Oliver Wallace features a number of effective melodies, whilst songs like 'You Can Fly!' and 'Following the Leader' are very memorable.So on the whole I'd say Peter Pan is something of another flawed masterpiece from Disney. Its only real weakness is its main characters and it's a shame that its sole issue happens to be an important one, Peter is difficult to root for and the Darlings are just a little too dull. With that said I think it excels in every other area. The story is laid-out well, Hook and Smee are great fun, the animation is excellent, it can be very funny at times and the songs stay with you. These stronger elements definitely outweigh the issues with the main characters. It's not Disney's strongest, but it is memorable and can be easily be enjoyed upon repeated viewings."
52,Peter Pan,8,18 October 2015,Good but...,"Peter Pan is a good film no doubt about that but it has some really stupid things in it first the crocodile reminds me of the shark from Jaws: The Revenge it just gets annoying at some point, everyone tries to kill Wendy for some reason because they think she loves Peter and that shaving scene was laughable but in a bad way and the film is not as funny as other Disney films. But Peter Pan still has the magic of Disney some good laughs and the Hook v.s Peter Pan is still a great battle not the best Disney movie ever made but not a terrible one either. I give it a 8 out of 10 it's a good film and still entertaining."
53,Peter Pan,10,3 October 2015,Forever young,"My parents took me to see Walt Disney's ""Peter Pan"" in 1953 when I was 5-years old. I was completely hooked. I was imprinted with this movie the way future generations would be imprinted with ""Star Wars"". For months after, my anxious parents wished they had opted for deep-pile carpet rather than highly-polished floorboards as I leapt from every piece of furniture in the house aided by imaginary pixie dust.Disney's take on the story of the boy who never grew up and his adventures with the Darling children in Neverland may have been even more influential, because I ended up earning my living as an artist for the last 50 years.It wasn't until 25 years later that I saw the film again and I must admit I was apprehensive. Would I be disappointed and see flaws that were not apparent to an overawed child? Well, that didn't happen. Instead, I was overawed all over again with the mastery of the whole thing.But of course, the film was more that just stunning visuals; there was also the story that was adapted from J. M. Barrie's famous book. And the film has copped plenty of flack over the years - racism and sexism being a couple of the heavier charges laid against it.The depiction of the Native Americans probably wouldn't get off the drawing board these days, but back in the 50's just about every race and creed had their own cinematic stereotypes, which were repeated in movie after movie. To be totally fair, Disney was actually following the lead of Barrie himself who refers to the Indians as 'Redskins' throughout his story and deals with them in the broadest of stereotypes with a surprising amount of violence thrown in.As for being sexist, possibly Tinkerbell has come in for the most attention with her voluptuous figure and occasional hip wiggling - she is referred to as Twerkerbell in one critique of the film. But again, rather than just the Disney artists over-vamping an innocent fairy, here is J. M. Barrie's description of Tink: ""exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to embonpoint"". That archaic word means a plump, hourglass figure. I rest my case.To see how good this film is, you only need to compare it with the sequel, ""Return to Neverland"" made in 2002. With bigger eyes and individual shading, the characters seem more cartoony, lacking much of the warmth and style of the earlier version.There have been plenty of stage and film versions of the story over the decades, but my favourite is still Walt Disney's 1953 film; even after 62 years, it has lost none of its magic for me."
54,Peter Pan,8,7 January 2015,classic Disney,"It's the classic J. M. Barrie story. George Darling declares that it's Wendy's last night in the nursery and ties Nanna in the backyard. While the Darling parents are out, Peter Pan chases his shadow to the nursery. John, Michael and Wendy join him to fly to Neverland using pixie dust from Tinker Bell. Captain Hook leads the pirates who vows to get revenge on Peter Pan for the lost of his hand. The crocodile that ate his hand has developed a taste for Hook. Lucky for him, he's ticking after swallowing a clock. A jealous Tinker Bell convinces the Lost Boys to shoot down Wendy bird. Hook and Mr. Smee have kidnapped Indian princess Tiger Lily to find Peter Pan's hiding place.It's a fun Disney classic. Captain Hook and Mr. Smee provide the big broad comedy. The fun is that the cartoon doesn't hold back. The crocodile has sharp teeth. It's inappropriate at times especially with the portrayal of the native tribe and the song ""What Made the Red Man Red?"" Tinker Bell almost steals the show. The animation is beautiful. It's one of Disney's golden age movies."
55,Peter Pan,7,3 November 2014,Entertaining film,"The 1940's were tough years for the Walt Disney Company. Due to World War II, films like Pinocchio, Fantasia and Bambi did a poor job at the box office because the European market was cut off. The package films that were released during the second half of the 1940's were enjoyable, but they weren't profitable enough to keep the company strong. Hence the reason Disney decided to release Cinderella in 1950. If Cinderella would've flopped, there's no telling if Disney would even exist today. Luckily, Cinderella was a major success and allowed Disney to release other full length features. In 1953, the Walt Disney Company released Peter Pan. Much like Cinderella, Peter Pan was well received at the box office and even turned out to be the highest grossing film of 1953. The film also received praise from critics. So is Peter Pan really that great? The film is based on the 1904 play that was written by J.M. Barrie. Peter Pan (voiced by Bobby Driscoll) is a boy who never grows up. Wendy (voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) tells stories about Peter to her younger brothers, John and Michael. Her father, George (voiced by Hans Conried) does not approve of the tales and tells Wendy it's about time she grows up, so she has to leave the nursery room in which Wendy and her brothers sleep. They meet Peter Pan and Tinkerbell in the room and fly off to Neverland. Being jealous of Wendy, Tinkerbell tells the lost boys to shoot Wendy while she's flying. Peter manages to save Wendy and bans Tinkerbell. While visiting the mermaids, Wendy and Peter see how Captain Hook (also voiced by Hans Conried) and Mr. Smee (voiced by Bill Thompson) kidnap Tiger Lilly, the daughter of the Indian Chief. Peter distracts Hook and the crocodile appears, so Hook and Smee flee. Captain Hook looks for another way to find out about Peter's hiding place. He kidnaps Tinkerbell. Because she's jealous of Wendy, she actually reveals Peter's whereabouts, but wants Hook to promise he won't lay a finger on Peter. Hook does so, but Tinkerbell doesn't trust him and wants to warn Peter, but Hook locks her up. Meanwhile, Wendy has become jealous of Tiger Lilly, because she kisses Peter. That's the reason she tells her brothers they'll go home. The Lost Boys become interested and want to go with them, except for Peter. Wendy, her brothers and the Lost Boys are captured by pirates, while Hook places a bomb in Peter's hideout. Tinkerbell finds out about the Hook's plan and breaks free in order to save Peter. She manages to save him and Peter fights Captain Hook on Hook's ship. The crocodile appears again and chases Hook off. Wendy and her brothers return to their room and it becomes apparent that it was Wendy's dream. She tells her father she's ready to grow up, but now her father believes it's too soon for her to grow up.Peter Pan is an enjoyable Disney classic with some great animation, but it isn't anything groundbreaking. Peter's character isn't very interesting. He just comes across as an average boy and the voice work from Bobby Driscoll isn't very good either. That being sad, his character isn't bad or anything, it's just bland. Tinkerbell is an interesting character as she's extremely jealous of Wendy and even attempts to hurt her. She's led by emotions when she reveals Peter's whereabouts to Captain Hook, because she's blindsided by jealousy. She understands she's done something wrong and wants to save Peter and in doing so, she manages to redeem herself. The most interesting part of Peter Pan is easily Captain Hook. He's not as evil and maniacal as some of Disney's villains, but he's very entertaining, especially during his scenes with the crocodile, which are all fantastic. The Captain Hook character alone makes this film worth the view. But there are a lot of other things that work really well. The songs are nice, the animation looks beautiful and there are a lot of interesting side characters, like the Indians, the mermaids and the pirates. Overall, Peter Pan is an entertaining Disney classic."
56,Peter Pan,8,23 September 2014,To be a kid at heart,"This is a adventurous childhood movie that deals with delving into the inner child of everyone in my opinion. How a girl can relive one last adventure as a child before entering the real world. And the this film takes place in a place called Neverland, where you can be a child and be youthful forever. This is a magical animated film that delves into the imagination of a child's heart. I didn't really like the character Peter Pan in this as much as I thought I did when I was a kid. Although a lot of the things that happen in this movie is a fantasy when it comes to dealing with the real world. However I believe integrity is one of the most important aspect of a man and I did like how it portrayed that through Peter Pan. Overall, this is a magical adventure that is worth a watch. Especially if you are a kid at heart.8.4/10"
57,Peter Pan,9,3 July 2014,Classic Disney,"Peter Pan is one of the classic Disney movies. It has a magical feeling about it. Peter Pan's flight is one of my favourite rides at Walt Disney World because of this movie. There are some racist parts in the movie,I think it provides a great opportunity to talk to your kids about it and how the world has changed since the time this movie was made.Peter Pan is really a wonderful movie showing while you do have to grow up you don't have to stop having an imagination or sense of wonder. You can retain the fun. Wendy is a great big sister and shows that by looking after her brothers. The parents do leave the kids alone but Wendy is supposed be around 13 so I don't think it's that big of a deal especially at the time the movie takes place in."
58,Peter Pan,9,26 June 2014,Off to Neverland!,A nice family movie classic! Watching Peter Pan make me feel young again.I always wanted to fly off to Neverland with Peter... the movie makes it out be a charming and magical world to live in. The lost boys could be a bit of trouble though - they are mischievous little devils but a joy to watch. The best parts of the film are when Captain Hook shows up - always so funny! Watching Hook and the alligator is most memorable and hilarious scene - I could watch that part over and over.This is a great film to watch with your kids. 9/10
59,Peter Pan,10,30 August 2011,"My favorite ""people"" Disney film as a child","When I was a kid, my favorite Disney movie was The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh followed by The Lion King but this was my favorite of the movies that featured people. My younger brother and I have fond memories of acting scenes of this movie out with each other. Captain Hook is one of my favorite Disney villains because he's so likable even while doing some pretty horrible stuff.If you haven't seen this movie, you're in for a treat. The visuals are gorgeous and the story is so timeless that it doesn't feel like an almost 60 year old movie at all! You and your kids will all find something to enjoy about it. Peter Pan actually had me laughing out loud in some parts and I'm almost 21 years old! Forget about your grown up burdens and travel to Neverland for an hour and 14 minutes. You'll be glad you did."
60,Peter Pan,6,23 October 2009,I Think Neverland Was the Other Way...,"Peter Pan is a wonderful story, in my top 10 for children's works. Unfortunately, this version does not make the top anything for children's films. Like its predecessor, Alice in Wonderland, this movie loses its soul with the abandonment of the wit and satire so abundant in the original.On the happier hand, it is a good enough film. Tinkerbell became such an icon you cannot say the name without conjuring up the Disney image. The songs are for the most part catchy and somewhat memorable, though I still hold that Katherine Beaumont is a warbly singer at best. The plot is still interesting, but the tension between Wendy and Peter is severely lacking. She is obviously jealous and he (somewhat) naively toys with her, but I miss that tangible tension between the characters that makes you wriggle in your seat. That, and the severe alteration of the original narration and dialog are what keeps the film from soaring.Overall, not the best thing to come out of the Disney vault. But if this is the worst they have to offer (Pixar partnerships excluded), I can by no means complain. My recommendation: skip this and get the 2003 live version. Its excellent in every way: wit, tension and storybook quality.Quote of the Film:-I hereby banish you forever! -Please, not forever! -Well for a week, then."
61,Peter Pan,1,5 December 2006,ugh,"""Peter Pan"" contains what is probably the most vicious portrayal of non-white people ever in an animated feature. The Indians are portrayed as red-skinned savages when they first capture Wendy, John and Michael, then as jolly nice guys once Peter Pan rescues the chief's daughter. To add insult to injury, there's even a song asking what makes them red! I know, that's not Disney's fault. J.M. Barrie wrote the novel, so he's the one who created this stereotypical representation of Native Americans. But when we pass off racism as cute entertainment, we're doing a great disservice to any effort to promote peace and justice. But these sorts of portrayals are typical of Disney movies: the minstrel-resembling birds in ""Dumbo"", the Siamese cats in ""Lady and the Tramp"", and others. And the movie's not just racist, but also sexist. Tinkerbell lives a carefree existence until she sees herself in the mirror and thinks that she looks terrible. Is this the sort of images that we want to push? Anyway, for anything Peter Pan-related, I recommend ""Hook"" (come on, folks; it's got Robin Williams playing Peter Pan!), and ""Finding Neverland, about J.M. Barrie (played by Johnny Depp!) writing the story. But the derogatory screed that is this movie works best in classes about stereotypes."
62,Peter Pan,5,8 December 2013,J.M. Barrie,"Walt Disney's animated version of the J.M. Barrie children's story about Peter Pan, a boy who never grew up(and who has the power to fly) who takes Wendy Darling and her two brothers to his home in Never land, where Peter leads other ""lost boys"" who never grew up, and who must periodically do battle with the evil Captain Hook and his pirates, who themselves are after the elusive reptile who took Hook's hand many earlier. Will Wendy and her brothers survive this adventure, and make it back home? Not one of Walt Disney's better animated films, mostly because the story lacks warmth and appeal, and Peter does seem like a coldly aloof cipher. The supporting characters make up for it a bit."
63,Peter Pan,7,20 September 2011,"Fun, but kids will enjoy it more than adults","Disney's Peter Pan is one of those movies I enjoy less and less as I get older. No, it's got nothing to do with me thinking I'm too cool for Disney movies; on the contrary, I'm a proud Disneyphile and my affections for most of my favorite childhood films has grown as I became old enough to appreciate the artistry and complexity hidden in some of them. The same cannot be said for Peter Pan, a film which children are more apt to enjoy than adults.The movie starts in the Darling household as the younger Darling children, John and Michael, are reenacting stories about Peter Pan told to them by their older sister, Wendy. Mr. Darling, constantly disrupted by their antics as he prepares himself for a party, becomes frustrated and tells Wendy she is too old to be staying in the nursery with the boys and says she will have to grow up, which upsets the three children greatly. After their parents leave for the party, the children are visited by Peter Pan himself and the pixie Tinkerbell. When Wendy tells him she has to grow up, Peter insists they all come with him to Neverland, where they can remain young forever. He teaches them to fly and they go off to Neverland, where they have a series of adventures involving mermaids, Indians, and pirates led by Pan's nemesis, Captain Hook.It cannot be denied that the movie has many positive elements. Its best asset is its immense entertainment value. There is a fair amount of swashbuckling and comedy, and the soundtrack is an absolute delight. Upon rewatching the film for the first time in years, I was astonished by how funny all the gags were, especially the scenes featuring the crocodile and Hook. Hook's right-hand man Smee is pretty funny too, most of his goofy business never failed to earn at least a chuckle from me.As fun as Peter Pan is, however, it doesn't hold up as one of the all-time greats because of the majority of its characters. Aside from Hook, Smee, and Tinkerbell, most of the cast is either bland, annoying, or downright unlikable. Despite being the actual main character, Wendy is uninteresting and overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Her brothers are even less interesting. The Lost Boys are annoying and while I'm no anal PC person, the Indian scene makes me cringe.The character I have the biggest issue with is the titular character himself. Peter Pan is an unlikable jerk, considerate of no one but himself, brash, narcissistic, and for the most part lacking empathy. The film paints him as a hero, yet he has few heroic qualities; I'm not saying he's the incarnation of evil or that I don't like flawed characters, but it seems we're supposed to think his way of doing things is right. The film never decides whether growing up or staying young like Peter is the thing to do. At first, it seems that Wendy gets tired of Peter's immaturity and sees the necessity to leave such childish behavior behind, yet later on she's idealizing him again. I guess you could say the scene where Tinkerbell saves Peter's life and he tells her how much she means to him is supposed to redeem him in some way, but the scene seems to have little impact as it's over way too soon. The story's sense of fun causes the theme to be pushed aside, and more attention is given to swordfights and slapstick than to whether or not we're supposed to embrace or reject eternal childhood.Most people don't pay attention to the muddled theme, however. The main draw of Peter Pan will always be its entertainment factor. Even though my affection for the movie has diminished with time, I won't lie by saying I was bored. Sure, Peter Pan is far from masterpiece status, but it's a fun ride nonetheless. 7/10"
64,Peter Pan,8,4 September 2007,"A fun Disney flick, good for some laughs and adventure","This was one of several Disney films that I can recall seeing several times as a kid. I also once read the ""Peter Pan"" book by J.M. Barrie (adapted from his play) at school during my elementary years, but don't seem to have any memory of it, even though I had permanent memories of this movie adaptation by then. Eventually, I went off Disney for a long time, but lately, I have been watching Disney films after not seeing them for many years. I finally got around to watching ""Peter Pan"" again last night, discovering that it was still good.Wendy, John, and Michael are three siblings in the Darling family who live in a nursery in London, England. One night, after they've gone to bed, they are visited by Peter Pan, who has come with his little fairy friend, Tinkerbell, searching for his shadow! After the three have been awakened, Peter teaches them how to fly, and they fly with him to Neverland! However, much danger awaits them once they arrive, which will make their stay in this magical land difficult! One problem they have to face is the evil Captain Hook and his crew! Hook's hand was cut off by Peter Pan, and he wants his vengeance! Now that Peter has brought the Darling siblings to Neverland with him, the angry pirate captain is a threat to them as well!Now, one thing some may criticise this movie for is the portrayal of the ""Indians"" in Neverland. This part of the film is racist, probably more so than any other Disney film I've ever seen, and it did make me feel a little uncomfortable. However, that certainly didn't ruin the entire film for me. Overall, ""Peter Pan"" is a fun romp, filled with excitement, nicely colourful animation (maybe better than in previous Disney efforts), and humour. A lot of the humour comes from scenes with Captain Hook and Mr. Smee, two very funny villains! So, no matter what age group you're in, if you're into early Disney animated features, and can get over the racism that I've mentioned, I highly recommend this Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie's story."
65,Peter Pan,10,30 July 2006,"Soaring, like Dumbo!!!!!","Disney's 1953 film ""Peter Pan"" took place in ""olde tyme"" England, and children had wished that they could fly. In it are the familiar characters of Peter Pan, Hook, Tinkerbell, and we are magically transported to that place called Neverland, where children would never want to grow up. (Now why in the world would you do that? Oh, well. It's Disney!!!!!)I have first seen this movie back in 2003 or so on the ABC network. Sure, it was more of a marketing type of thing rather than a movie type of thing (I assume the movie is really, really short!!!!!), but it was still magical and enjoyable!The good thing about this movie: it, also, is based on the story, but it's even better in Technicolor!!!!!""Peter Pan"" - soar high!!!!! 10 stars"
66,Peter Pan,7,27 December 2004,One of Disney's classics!!,"Overall, this film is definitely one of Disney's best. Although many people my age may find it boring and a little babyish, I can't help but think of all the wonderful jokes in it, that make it suitable for not just toddlers and little children. The action and heroism of Peter Pan instantly makes children love him. Mr Darling is very funny, as is Captain Hook. The Darling children's personalities fit perfectly, making it a film I could watch over and over again. I especially love the crocodile - when I was a child I never noticed how hilarious he was, but now I laugh every time I see him! The graphics are good, the scene when they are flying over London is particularly good, where you see all the recognisable landmarks, and it really captures the sense of excitement in the children.However, some things I disliked. Firstly, although Peter is great for enchanting younger children, the way he is always in charge and boasts around being superior annoys me every time. The Lost Boys, also, in my opinion were not as good as they could have been, if they had been given the other half of their brains. Tinkerbell looked great, but she could have had a bigger role, and a less vain appearance.Other than that, I highly recommend this film!!"
67,Peter Pan,10,10 September 2005,This movie ROXORS!,"I'd go as far to say that this is my second all-time favorite movie. ^.^ To tell the truth, I actually have a huge crush on him. ^.^ I like the parts with Tigerlily. There's this one musical number where she's dancing, and Peter's watching her, and I think he was being hypnotized just by watching her dance. She's pretty good. At dancing, I mean.There's also this one scene where Peter FINALLY shows up with Tink looking for his Shadow. As you might have guessed, Shadow has a mind of his own while he's detached from Peter. So after he gets out of the drawer, they're chasing each other, and when Peter does catch up to Shadow it's only because he tripped. And broke something. And woke Wendy up. So she gets out her sewing kit and re-attaches Shadow to Peter.Peter gets real sentimental in the after-explosion scene. Tink's the one who saved him from the bomb, so she almost dies. He saves her somehow, and tells her she means everything to him. (okay that's not exactly what he said but still) I think he almost starts crying when he says that.Might I also add the fact that he was getting all pouty during Wendy's song. I think it might be because he was remembering his own mother, who was killed by Hook a long time ago. Okay, I just made that up. But it might be true. And in the scene after that, I'm pretty sure he'd already fallen asleep (even though it wasn't shown) 'cause he didn't hear Wendy scream.In closing, Peter looks pretty good in tights."
68,Peter Pan,7,7 April 2017,"Conventionally good, but never beyond one's expectations","Well, even a lesser Disney movie like ""Peter Pan"" will still be a first-rate animated movie as far as, you know, animation goes. If the 1953 movie didn't break any particular ground, it was still good enough to provide one of the most iconic and instantly recognizable characters: Tinkerbell. Remember, it was Tink who provided the finale of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" by magically turning the screen to black after Porky Pig stuttered out his ""That's all, folks!"" catchphrase.Tink belongs to the Pantheon of iconic Disney characters and it is appropriate that in one scene she's used as a saltshaker to supply fairy dust to Wendy and her bewildered brothers, she gives the film a certain flavor and even a little sassy touch in what would have been predictable and conventional entertainment, despite the cocky personality of Peter Pan and his interesting rivalry with Captain Hook. It is a fascinating bit of irony that the sidekick of the embodiment of childhood spirit is jealous and worried about the length of her hips.The film has indeed enough innuendo to content the amateurs of psychological and sexual readings in Disney characters but if you want to judge the book by the cover, the film has all it takes to make a passable Disney film, it has that blissful energy and quick readiness for adventures that characterize children and a little touch of fairy dust that became the trademark of Disney films. And Peter Pan isn't a one-dimensional hero, he's a larger-than-life boy who's a both an immature kid and an alpha-male with a harem of mermaids and every female character having the hots for him, he also happens to be a bad-ass fighter.But it takes too long for the film to take off, the opening in the house drags for more than twenty minutes and the annoying father occupies so much screen time that any viewer would need more than a little vacation day on 'Never Land' to forget about him. At the end, there's just something that leaves you hanging on, you know you're supposed to have a little glee in the eye somewhere in the film, but all the masterful animation, the wonderfully staged fights and crocodile sequences, the animation of Pan who spends most of the time not just flying but floating and the interactions between Hook and Smee fail to connect with the story.And there are too many Lost boys so that you don't really care for them, Michael and John are only sidekicks but they don't do much in the film. It's all in Pan, Tinkerbell and Hook with Wendy as a passive and rather dull observer. It doesn't capture the essence of JM Barrie's novel but it does fill all the requirements of a Disney movie, and nothing else. When you finished it, you're just spent a nice moment but then there's nothing that really stands out, what are you going to talk about after watching the film? What did the kids learn from their adventure, that they need a mother and Wendy can't play the surrogate mother anymore because she's got to think of her own future as a mother? The ending was bittersweet with the emphasis on bitter.Maybe I'm biased because I didn't get to see the film when I was a kid, I saw many movies of the same Disney period but only excerpts from ""Peter Pan"". However, I grew up watching the episodes of the anime based on JM Barrie's novels and they were more faithful to his spirit, the kids were all fully developed characters and the relationship between Pan and Wendy was really captivating on a love-and-hate level, but it's like the animators tried to condense the whole story in one-night event like a dream so the whole thing seemed a bit rushed. There's not the warmth of ""Lady and the Tramp"", the fast-paced rhythm of ""Alice in Wonderland"" or the swingy catchy vibes of the ""Jungle Book"" time, and there's no romance, no friendship whatsoever.I guess there's something to blame on the context, by the time ""Peter Pan"" was released, ""Cinderella"" had - three years before- consolidated the financial strength of Disney studios allowing Uncle Walt to keep on expanding his business, the studio would face a few highs and lows but never with the same stakes as those in 1950. So we're in the middle of the 50's, at the peak of Disney's career, when the animation was lead by the ""Nine Old Men"", they were there from 1937 to 1977, if you do the math, the 50's was right in the middle, and it was still before the Xerox device, used for ""101 Dalmatians"", would simplify animation but with a greater focus on the story, the music, the characters, elements that seems to lack in 'Pan'.""Peter Pan"" is a true product of its era, a classic Walt Disney movie that has been made with confidence and dreams, and how appropriate that it tackles a story of a young boy who doesn't want to grow up. It is like the essence of Disney to make dreams possible, and in the case of ""Peter Pan"", there was a lot to say about this, but it never quite clicks. Maybe because it was met at a time where the master was too focused on his Disneyland project, on his work on TV and that animated features became a sort of a milk cow.I remarked a strange pattern, it's only where the future of the studios are at stakes that Disney make terrific movies, they're never as good as when they're pivotal and necessary, I can see why ""Peter Pan"", while a good film in its own right, isn't as good or memorable as the other features."
69,Peter Pan,,19 July 2015,"Not as good as other movies of its time, but still Disney quality","For me Peter Pan is one of the lesser movies of the so-called post-war restoration era of Disney. It's not the triumphant return of Cinderella, nor the bizarre fun of Alice in Wonderland, nor does it have the warmhearted atmosphere of Lady and the Tramp nor the technical quality of Sleeping Beauty. It's still a marvelous adventure film and heads and shoulders above most of its animated peers. It just means that by Disney standards it's not near the top.A few reason for this. First of all, I don't think that Captain Hook is a very good villain. He has the visual appeal and a great voice actor in Hans Conried who, following the proper Peter Pan tradition, also voiced Mr. Darling. But I think he's way too slapsticky, which takes away all the menace most other version of the character have. Then again, the crocodile is awesome.The songs are also of poorer quality than in many other Disney films. You Can Fly is of course a classic, but other than that I cannot remember any other song. Except of course What Made the Red Man Red, which is problematic for other reasons.Plus Wendy is something of a step back from Alice, the previous Disney heroine, who was also voiced by Kathryn Beaumont, by the way. And I have absolutely nothing against Beaumont, she's amazing, but the character herself is a lot less activate and personal than Alice.But, it stills has that Disney charm. The animation is unsurpassed, Tinker Bell is one of Disney's finest characters for a reason, the actual plot is a lot of fun and as a whole it's over an hour's worth of fun, excitement and good family entertainment. It's not one of the strongest Disney films in my opinion, but is definitely worth a watch no matter your age."
70,Peter Pan,8,16 October 2013,Time to walk the plank.,"This is another magical Disney movie about the boy, Peter Pan, who didn't grow up and learned to fly. He visits the Darling family and takes three kids away on a journey to the enchanting and luscious Neverland, where endless adventures and mysteries await them. The kids get caught in a tug-a-war between Peter Pan and his tag team of whimsical and colorful characters against the notorious Captain Hook and his band of pirates.This Disney classic is full of catchy tunes and has plenty of action - a perfect good guy vs. bad guy story for the kids. This movie also introduces Tinker Bell, the tiny winged fairy and a loyal sidekick to Peter Pan. Tinker Bell would go on to make cameos and guest appearances in Disney cartoons and TV shows, and would occasionally be the character that opens or closes a show with a wave of her wand.Some of the characteristics of the characters were a little unremarkable, particularly in Peter Pan and Tinker Bell - a little cold and irresponsible. But, a pretty good classic for any Disney collection! Grade B"
71,Peter Pan,7,22 December 2010,Disney at its best,Peter Pan is a story that only Disney could tell and despite various other attempts to bring the classic novel to the big screen this is by far the best.It captures all of the whimsy and wonder of the original novel and while it softens some of the dark edges it remains faithful to the words of J.M Barrie.All the elements of a wonderful family film are there and the film is marvellous for everyone. It remains one of the best Disney films ever and that is down to the skill of Disney and his animators. Overall a fantastic film that is fantastic for all ages.
72,Peter Pan,10,12 March 2010,Best Disney Film. Ever.,"Peter Pan is the classic tale of a boy who will never grow up.The Darling children become part of his world and soon, we are all taken for a ride off to Neverland.What makes this Disney film so special is that is it so unlike any other movie. There are no princesses, no princes, no dragons. It is a magical adventure about children, friendship, and a crazy crocodile.The music isn't brilliant, but that's not the point of this film. Characters like the Lost Boys, Captain Hook, and Smee provide such a great comedic element that the use of musical numbers would be too much to handle.As always, the animation was above excellent. Neverland was beautifully drawn, every aspect was perfect. It glitters and shines.Overall, Peter Pan leaves you feeling happy and wanting to be a kid again. I could watch it again and again and still find something new to marvel at. A true Disney classic."
73,Peter Pan,10,19 December 2002,Really cool Disney cartoon,"I recently saw this movie again, and I felt as though I was watching it for the very first time again. It's got a magical feel to it, and I didn't feel silly watching it, even though it's aimed at younger kids and I'm a teenager. I guess the one thing that often made me wince was Wendy's voice. She sounds way too old, and in the movie they say she's a child, so we're expected to think she's around the age of ten or something, except she looks like she could be fifteen. She's still very mature, and I didn't see the problem with her ""growing up"". She had to grow up sooner or later.But overall, I like this movie, especially considering that it's one of Disney's earliest productions. It's one of those movies that's enchanting."
74,Peter Pan,10,21 May 2002,This cartoon rocks!,"Peter Pan the boy who did not want to grow up. Wendy, John, and Michael children who know well who Peter Pan is. Wendy tells her little brothers stories of Peter Pan each night before bed.One night Peter Pan and his little fairy Tinker Bell come to visit and hear the stories, and also to find his shadow. Wendy and the boys wake up to find Peter Pan in their room, when he finally asks them to come visit his Never Never Land. He shares with them the lost boys who need a mother and someone to tell them stories. Wendy and her brothers agree to come. With a pinch of pixie dust and good thoughts they begin to fly, following Peter, second star to your right and straight on till morning. The adventure begins, pirates, mermaids, Captain Hook, join in and enjoy the magical journey, that takes only one night. Fun for the whole family."
75,Peter Pan,5,1 March 2006,not my favourite,"'Peter Pan' is a story that most children are familiar with. This is a story about three siblings who are introduced to Peter Pan. Peter Pan is a boy who never grew up and who can do magic, fight pirates, and who lives with other boys in a magical world. 'Peter Pan' was never one of my favourite Disney films, and this may be down to personal opinion more than anything else. I could not relate to the children in this film, and maybe this has to do with me being a female or something, but I thought the whole concept of not growing up was silly. Despite not really caring for the story, I did enjoy the Peter Pan film when I was younger. By the film, I am talking about the one starring the female who played Peter Pan."
76,Peter Pan,7,18 April 2013,3rd out of 8 in the Silver Era,"A year and a half later, they released Peter Pan in 1953.The story is about a girl named Wendy and her two brothers travel to Neverland with Peter Pan, after Wendy refuses to grow up and sleep in her own room and to be banned from the nursery. Her father does not like her telling Peter Pan stories, and thinks that she is too old for that. When they reach Neverland, they experience an adventure of a lifetime.Most of the characters are a bit irritating. Peter Pan comes off as a selfish, cocky, arrogant douchebag, Tinkerbell is a bitter, ruthless bitch, and Wendy can come across as whiny, bland, and a bit of a brat. The Lost Boys are your typical troublesome orphans, Michael is a smart know-it-all, and John is your typical 3 year old brother. Captain Hook and Smee, are entertaining and hilarious together. This can come off as a problem because you are supposed to root for the good guys, but it is very hard to when they are incompetent and you are irritated by them. You start to root for the bad guys as the film goes on.The songs in this movie are great, catchy, and memorable. The dogs everybody knows are the controversial ""What Makes The Red Man Red"", ""Following The Leader"", and the movie's theme song ""You Can Fly"". The thing with this soundtrack is that each sic has its own theme and sound. Disney's most well known songs are also in this soundtrack.Even thoughts characters can be a problem, everything else is great. The plot is well- paced and interesting, the characters are not bland (though irritating), and there are fantastic songs. This is perfect for the family. It is gender-neutral, and filled with action and adventure. Just expect to be irritated by some of the characters."
77,Peter Pan,10,23 July 2012,You can Fly! You can Fly! You can Fly!,"One of my favorite Disney movies. When Mr. George Darling(Hans Conreid) and Mrs. Mary Darling(Heather Angel) left on the night of the dinner party, Wendy(Kathryn Beaumont), John(Paul Collins), and Michael(Tommy Luske) meet the boy who refuses to grow up: Peter Pan(Bobby Driscoll). When they fly to Neverland, they come face-to-face with the evil Captain James Hook(Also Hans Conreid) and his bumbling but silly assistant Mr. Smee(Bill Thompson). With the help of the Lost Boys(Robert Ellis, Jeffrey Silver, Jonny McGovern, Stuffy Singer, and Tony Butala), will Peter Pan defeat Captain Hook or will his next flight around Neverland be his last? The musical numbers are unforgettable and probably the one of the funniest moments in the movie was when Peter Pan tricks Mr. Smee by impersonating Captain Hook. Also starring Tom Conway as the Narrator, Candy Candido as the Indian Chief, June Foray as the Squaw, the Mellomen as the pirates and the Indians, and Corinne Orr as Tiger Lily."
78,Peter Pan,,13 August 2011,"Great movie, BUT","I love Walt Disney's Peter Pan. I have loved it since I was a child, and I still watch it to this day. It is a family classic that teaches us not to grow up too quickly and reminds us all of the joys of childhood. However, caution should be exercised when allowing children to watch this movie. Though Peter Pan seems innocent enough at first glance, it contains sexist and patriarchal ideologies which can be damaging to children. In her textbook Critical Theory Today,which is used in college classrooms across the nationLois Tyson writes: ""Patriarchy is thus, by definition, sexist, which means it promotes the belief that women are innately inferior to men."" Do we really want our childrenor anyoneto adopt this belief? When the animated film came out in 1953 (and especially when the book was published in the early 1900's) these patriarchal views of traditional gender roles were the norm. Females were supposed to be submissive to males. If they were not, they were outcast and/or reprimanded. Males were supposed to be the providers and protectors, and if they were unable to fulfill these roles they were considered failures. A lot has changed since then. We have gained new insight and understanding of gender roles. No girl should grow up believing that their only options in life are either that of ""wife"" and ""mother"" or ""b****""and ""wh*re,"" and that if they violate a patriarchal normsuch as expressing their opinions or refusing to submit to a malethey are the latter. No boy should grow up believing that if he does not accept a risky challenge he is a failure, or if he displays feelings such as love, pain, or fear he is a ""coward"" or a ""sissy."" Peter Pan leads children to adhere to these oppressive gender roles through the actions and results of its characters: Peter Pan always gives the orders and expects them to be obeyed. Princess Tiger Lily and Tinkerbelle have no voice in any matterfiguratively and literallythey never speak! Tinkerbelle represents Peter Pan's significant other: voiceless and submissive. When she attempts to express her concern over Peter Pan bringing home another girl (Wendy) he promptly banishes her. Peter Pan is the provider and the protector. He never backs down from a challenge, especially if his reputation is at risk (such as when Captain Hook lures him into a battle by calling him a coward). Peter Pan never shows fear and he never fails. He is portrayed as the hero. Captain Hook does show fear, for instance whenever the crocodile is present. He loses all of his battles with Peter Pan, and is then called a ""codfish"" because he is weak and helpless. Captain hook is portrayed as the antagonist, or the ""bad guy."" The resulting implication for males is that: strength, power and success at all endeavors = hero; Displays of emotion and unsuccessful attempts = failure and disappointment in all aspects of life. I do not mean to chase anyone off from this movie, but rather to provide a warning to viewers. Even if one does not know what feminist criticism is, or the meanings of ""sexist"" and ""patriarchal,"" it is still very possible to internalize the concepts subliminally, especially through appealing media, which Peter Pan certainly is. So by all means, watch this movie, but watch it with your and be prepared to follow up with a discussion."
79,Peter Pan,10,16 November 2006,Excellent Disney film adaptation of the J.M. Barrie tale,"PETER PAN, in my opinion, is an excellent Disney film adaptation of the J.M. Barrie tale. One of the things I liked most about it was the music, especially ""You Can Fly."" If you ask me, it was funny when Peter (voice of Bobby Driscoll) said, ""You're next, Hook."" If you want to know why he said that, you'll have to see the movie. Also, I though that the performances were top-notch, the casting was terrific, and the scenery was beautiful. Oh, and I also loved the music, especially the music that plays during the battle. I hate to admit it, but that was my favorite part. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent Disney adaptation of the J.M. Barrie tale to everyone who has not seen it."
80,Peter Pan,10,7 October 2006,"This is the classic Barie story, Disney style.","I loved this film growing up, and I still do. Alright, so it may not be a musical, but the few songs are still wonderful and imaginative. If you have any kids, or are wondering what to have the kids you're baby-sitting watch, have them watch Peter Pan. (The guidelines say that each comment has to be at least 10 lines, so the rest of this paragraph is just a rant.) In my opinion this is one of THE best Disney films, compared to recent CGI films. I think this is 10/10, and a timeless classic. Everyone can enjoy it, and it will hold a special place in your heart. If you don't watch it, you'll be missing out. And afterward, it will leave a sweet place in your heart. It's one of those special treasures that you can watch again and again and never be bored."
81,Peter Pan,7,15 September 2005,Peter Pan,"As a kid I used to love this cartoon a lot better than Steven Spielberg's live action film. The only one thing they changed about this film is that Tinker Bell saved Peter Pan by throwing away an about-to-explode bomb instead of drinking poison. Anyway, basically three Darling (that's their surname) children Wendy, John and Michael all have their own thoughts and feelings, and Wendy mainly doesn't want to grow up. Obviously, flying Peter Pan (the boy who never grows up) takes them to the magic world of Neverland where this is possible. Captain Hook is trying everything he can to catch Pan when he realises he is back. Also with Indians, Mermaids and the Lost Boys. It was number 91 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 79 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!"
82,Peter Pan,8,24 May 2013,Not a Disney classic but still is fun,"I really enjoy Disney's older films. From Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and up, the mouse house has produced many a film that have boasted in crisp animation, catchy musical numbers and likable characters. And for Peter Pan (1953), that technique does not move astray from its predecessors. It is funny though, while watching it I began to notice a trend about the character of Peter Pan himself.The plot is taken from J.M. Barrie's story, as like many other products. A group of children end up spending the night in the world of Neverland with their friend Peter Pan, spirit of youth and his group of misfit orphans (I guess). Because of that, they are bound to run into Pan's nemesis, Captain Hook and his band of pirates. And like any other Disney film, it'll be difficult to resist the charm of any of the characters in this movie. Oddly enough, the character I found the least likable was Peter Pan himself. Here's why.The boy is arrogant. He doesn't like listening to others opinions, even when it might be to his benefit. He's also inconsiderate. Since he's the oldest male of the group, he also thinks what he says is law and deserves the best treatment. Lastly, Peter Pan is a ""bad boy"" character or player. Notice that when he's with another female, the female he was originally with becomes extremely jealous. He also doesn't acknowledge this either leading back to his arrogant personality. He's a playful but very thickheaded character. It actually got disgusting to a point that these girls were falling for him.The only other thing I found weird was that the Island of Neverland was a star located in the sky? I don't get it. But besides this, I found everything else enjoyable. My favorite character was Captain Hook for his funny and over the top performance. This is mostly because of the clicking crocodile that he keeps running into which seems to get funnier every time they're on screen together. The score provided by Disney veteran, Oliver Wallace continues to still make good scores for each film he has worked in. Overall it was a nice film, just couldn't believe how jerkish Peter Pan was.The story of Peter Pan is lively, full of color and contains a lot of charm. Unfortunately, the only character that seems to be lacking in it the most charm is our main character, Peter Pan. But for the most part, it is forgivable....mostly."
83,Peter Pan,7,21 March 2006,Good Movie,"this is a very good movie, but not my favorite version... but it is still good. i like the fact that they make Wendy and Peter older, like in the book... it is very hard to believe that a little boy, like in some other versions, could defeat Hook, and other monstrous things. i have not watched it in a while, but have started it again for a project i am working on. the only thing i don't like, and this is for all versions, and that is the fact that Peter leaves Wendy, he goes back to Neverland, and leaves her. they were meant to be, it makes it a real sad ending.i think it would be fun to rewrite it, with the same basic story, with a better ending."
84,Peter Pan,8,3 December 2016,"Yes, It's Racist but There's So Much More","I will start by saying, the times set up the culture for bad screen treatment of Native Americans. Ever see a John Wayne movie? If we can set aside the obvious negativity about this and look at a sparkling film with really good music. It is the J. M. Barrie film with a bit of poetic license. We have delightfully drawn characters who can fly and a group of lost boys. And, of course, a great Captain Hook and my favorite, Smee. If there is a slight criticism, it would be that Peter is a bit too confident. There's little vulnerability. One of the features of the book and the stage play is a vulnerability and a longing that doesn't quite translate."
85,Peter Pan,10,20 May 2015,childhood classic,"A childhood classic that is still enjoyable today . My 29 year older brother still believes he is one of the lost boys . With all of the fairy lure , the pirates , the sense that you are being taken back to a time in your childhood , where there were no worries and you still had a sense of wonder , that is what I want out of a childhood movie and that is what you get with this one . You return to your childhood where you can be anything and everything , and sometimes its good to just reset , Find your inner-child and let them out , come back with a better understanding of life and a tad more sense of who you are and who you were."
86,Peter Pan,,14 July 2013,Racial Song,"The song ""What makes a Red Man Red?"" IS terrible, and makes me SICK with anger! It uses phrases WE do not use ! (HOW?) ( UGH!) and the derogatory term (SQUAW ) which is something you would not want you children to hear if it were in YOUR language! It is rude calling US Injuns, as it is to say ""coloreds"" or using the N word! I am 53, and my mom never let me see this movie! NOW I KNOW WHY! I was livid to watch this for my first time on Disney JR with my granddaughter, this YEAR! COME ON Disney get with it! remove this song! And remove racial slurs from ALL Disney ""CLASSICS"" ! We are living in a time when this is no longer tolerated!"
87,Peter Pan,8,15 August 2010,It's better than Hook at least.,"After the disappointing and tepid Alice in Wonderland, I was worried about visiting the last of this lesser stage in Disney's pre-70s output. Thankfully, Peter Pan proves to be a very entertaining gem, thanks to some rousing set-pieces and solid animation, as well as a much less meandering and aimless narrative than Alice in Wonderland. Consider it Disney's guilty pleasure, something not really worth cherishing but that's certainly worth viewing for its best elements.Peter Pan is, of course, the classic J.M. Barrie story of siblings to go to Neverland with Peter Pan, the symbol of a child who shall never grow up and who represents the tragedy of lost childhood innocence. All this is done away with here, of course, and to the detriment of the film. While Disney's earlier films are certainly ""Disneyfied,"" I'd always felt that they replaced darker narrative with its use of visuals to enough of a degree that the stories remained intact in an intangible matter, but this one certainly feels dumbed down and pandering to me. The compelling Freudian components are here to an extent (with Hans Conried playing both Hook and Mr. Darling...brilliantly, I might add) but are still scooted under the mat in favor of high adventure and likable comic sense. Such things don't negate the entertainment value here, but it prevents me from possibly finding this to be among Disney's best works.Luckily, Disney really does bring us into the world of Neverland. Even London looks like a dream, with some gorgeous background work and surreal visuals that echo Fantasia in its imagination. The use of blue here is beautiful. Likewise, the individual societies characters each make an impact, from the rowdy pirates to the rambunctious lost boys to the exotic Indian tribe (which, it cannot be denied, are incredibly insensitive caricatures).As with many Disney films starring human characters, the protagonists in Peter Pan are actually quite boring. Wendy and her brothers exist only to be cloying and cute. Peter Pan fares better, thanks mostly to his likable ticks, but he's still pretty one-note (one of many characters animator Milt Kahl hated working on). The villains, on the other hand, are great fun. Hook is another iconic character who owns each scene he's in, with work by both Wolfgang Reitherman and Frank Thomas bringing him to life. Disney renaissance animators considered the model villain to strive for, as he not only can be conniving and imposing but also provide plenty of laughs whenever faced with his lone fear (the alligator who took me hand). Personally, I'm not sure the story always puts him in the right role at the right time, since he really should have been more bloodthirsty in certain scenes, but the animation on him is always fun to watch. Smee's often considered by Disney animators to be one of the greatest achievements in animator Ollie Johnston's career, for the reason that it's difficult to believably animate such dumb characters and he pulls it off flawlessly. But everyone's favorite character is, of course, Tinker Bell. Now, I could say it's because Marc Davis does a terrific job of bringing a feminin character to life, but I'll just say what we're all thinking: she's *beep* hot.Really, in the context of this movie, though, these characters don't grow as much as I'd wish. They have a bit too much pointless fun. Screwing with Captain Hook, messing with mermaids, having scavenger hunts or what have you. It's enjoyable viewing, but decidedly empty. I think the moment that sealed my reason for considering this minor Disney comes in the climactic battle, where Hook comes off as too much of a wimp. In the original story, he makes a chilling promise of his return, which would have probably undone the comic aspects admittedly. Still, the narrative gets the job done, and never drags, and there is enough of a presence of certain themes (Wendy acting as a mother figure, Mr. Darling's line at the end) that they don't feel completely left out. It's just not as prominent as I would have preferred.It occurs to me that I haven't spoken much about the original music in Disney's movies. It's wonderful in almost all of them (even Alice in Wonderland) but Peter Pan marks the first time the incidental score really jumped out at me. It is, like the film, thunderous and adventurous, and really one of the best orchestral backdrops to any Disney movie. The one sore spot here is the number ""What Makes the Red Man Red,"" which, even taking Song of the South and Dumbo into account, is probably the most racist thing I've ever seen in a Disney movie (before Pocahontas that is...do we notice a pattern here?) Despite my bellyaching about the lack of much real emotionality, it was nice to get a worthwhile viewing here, and to watch some master animators at work. As good as this movie is, however, it was Disney's next few pictures that really marked a true return to form, and which nearly matched the first five pictures in terms of style and storytelling.It's better than Hook at least."
88,Peter Pan,9,20 November 2009,Simply enchanting,"What a classic! Peter Pan is the story about the boy who wouldn't grow up and a girl named Wendy and her brothers who fly with him to Neverland, greatly shown here by Disney! With heart-warming and funny sequences(The crocodile for sure!), Peter Pan is a must-watch for everyone who loves Classic Disney! The characters are no-way near boring or dull, and the voice-work is outstanding! The songs are great too. I literally think 'You Can Fly' is one of Disney's most known songs. Who could not resist this movie? Seriously, I caught my strict boss at work watching it in her office! Just great. Worth watching for sure!"
89,Peter Pan,10,8 October 2009,One of the best Disney films,"I first saw this at the cinema back in the 90's, this is probably one of the best Disney films that were made. This is my favorite Peter Pan film that has been made, I didn't care much for the version with Jeremy Sumpter that came out about six years ago. My favorite part was when Peter met the Darling kids John, Michael + Wendy and sprinkles pixie dust on them to make them fly. I also liked the part when the John, Michael and the lost boys sing 'Following The Leader'. I can't explain why but I couldn't take Captain Hook seriously as a villain. I felt they shouldn't of made the sequel back in 2002, the sequels are as never as good as the originals."
90,Peter Pan,8,6 April 2009,Forever young!,"It's not my favourite Disney cartoon out there but I never tire of watching it. I give it an 8 because it's not at the top of my list yet it makes me feel like a child again. Every time I watch it, I feel an inkling of hope that such things exist. I'm not saying they don't but I can't say they do :/ To be young with a wild imagination! I don't think it ever dies and this Disney cartoon fires the point home by making anyone feel young again (if they're willing to suspend their reality and allow themselves to fly off to Neverland!). It's a shame they don't make cartoons like these anymore. I'm definitely not saying that cartoons now aren't great! They're just different and I have to say, the graphics were much more pleasant in the first half of the 20th century. The voices were smoother and the language was much better. Cartoons like Peter Pan allowed children of all ages (1 year and beyond) to enjoy themselves and, for those not expecting to see characters blown to pieces, this cartoon fits the bill as being an all-time classic. Enjoy!"
91,Peter Pan,,28 June 2004,my opinion of Peter pan,"Peter Pan is no doubt the best Disney movie.The story line is everything that people look for in a great family movie a boy who never grows up,a magical island(Neverland),pirates,indians,mermaids and fairies that will help complete the story. I wish there was a real Neverland where i could escape to when times get hard and Peter Pan who would help me during my knew life crisis and help me understand my problems.If Peter Pan was real i think all kids wouldn't have to deal with the responsibilities of becoming older they would be concentrating on the present not the future.All they would want to do is have fun and everyone would keep there window open.I'll always believe in Peter Pan and fairies especially Tinker Bell.love #1 rtist."
