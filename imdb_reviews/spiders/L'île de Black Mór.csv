0,L'île de Black Mór,7,11 April 2004,deserves more...,"I was pleasantly surprised to watch such a good french animation movie this year. Unfortunately it looks like it hasn't got the audience it deserved. I think that's because it's completely different from what the french have been making lately. First, on technical terms ( rather dark flat tints with no shades) and then, from the story line (a mere pirate story without much action, but interesting though). The hero, called ""the kid"", is struggling with problems and doubts any teenager has, and that is precisely what the movie is focusing on. Thus, too young children will not be able to understand everything. Actually i have been glad to watch, at last, a french animated film meant for people over 7! This is rare enough to be noticed, and that is why i advise everyone to take a look at it, whether they like ""les triplettes"" (which i found ridiculous and pathetically slow...) and ""kirikou"" or not.rated it 7 out of 10."
1,L'île de Black Mór,7,25 November 2008,Warning: somewhat erotic scene in middle of movie,"The movie is interesting and captivated our young daughters. A nice, serious story about an orphan who breaks out of his orphanage to become a pirate. The story had the feel of Dicken's story ""Great Expectations"". We were getting into the movie when half-way through one of the female characters loses her top and starts to make out with the ""kid"" the main character. Needless to say, we dove of the remote to flip it off. The french title of the film which we watched did not have a rating; we assumed G or PG at the worst. The scene was way to mature for kids and actually not necessary for the story. Definitely not ""G"", or even ""PG"". Screen the movie before showing to anyone under 18."
